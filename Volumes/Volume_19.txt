MUN, ADRIEN ALBERT MARIE DE, Count (1841- ), 
French politician, was born at Lumigny, in the department of 
Seine-et-Marne, on the 28th of February 1841. He entered the 
army, saw much service in Algeria (1862), and took part in 
the fighting around Metz in 1870. On the surrender of Metz, 
he was sent as a prisoner of war to Aix-la-Chapelle, whence he 
returned in time to assist at the capture of Paris from the 
Commune. A fervent Roman Catholic, he devoted himself 
to advocating a patriarch type of Christian Socialism. His elo- 
quence made him the most prominent member of the Cercles 
Catholiques d'Ouvriers, and his attacks on Republican social 
policy at last evoked a prohibition from the minister of war. 
He thereupon resigned his commission (Nov. 1875), and in the 
following February stood as Royalist and Catholic candidate 
for Pontivy. The influence of the Church was exerted to secure 
his election, and the pope during its progress sent him the order 
of St Gregory. He was returned, but the election was declared 
invalid. He was re-elected, however, in the following August, 
and for many years was the most conspicuous leader of the 
anti-Republican party. " We form," he said on one occasion, 
"the irreconcilable Counter-Revolution." As far back as 1878 he 
had declared himself opposed to universal suffrage, a declaration 
that lost him his seat from 1879 to 188 r. He spoke strongly 
against the expulsion of the French princes, and it was chiefly 
through his influence that the support of the Royalist party was 
given to General Boulanger. But as a faithful Catholic he obeyed 
the encyclical of 1892, and declared his readiness to rally to a 
Republican government, provided that it respected religion. 
In the following January he received from the pope a letter 
commending his action, and encouraging him in his social 
reforms. He was defeated at the general election of that 
year, but in 1894 was returned for Finistere (Morlaix). In 
1897 he succeeded Jules Simon as a member of the French 
Academy. This honour he owed to the purity of style 
and remarkable eloquence of his speeches, which, with a few 
pamphlets, form the bulk of his published work. In Ma voca- 
tion sociale (1908) he wrote an explanation and justification of 
his career. 

MUN, THOMAS (1571-1641), English writer on economics, 
was the third son of John Mun, mercer, of London. He began 
by engaging in Mediterranean trade, and afterwards settled 
down in London, amassing a large fortune. He was a member 
of the committee of the East India Company and of the standing 
commission on trade appointed in 1622. In 1621 Mun published 
A Discourse of Trade from England unto the East Indies. But 
it is by his England's Treasure by Forraign Trade that he is 
xix. 1 



remembered in his history of economics. Although written 
possibly about 1630, it was not given to the public until 1664, 
when it was " published for the Common good by his son John," 
and dedicated to Thomas, earl of Southampton, lord high 
treasurer. In it we find for the first time a clear statement of 
the theory of the balance of trade. 

MUNCHAUSEN, Baron. This name is famous in literary 
history on account of the amusingly mendacious stories known as 
the Adventures of Baron Munchausen. In 1785 a little shilling 
book of 49 pages was published in London (as we know from the 
Critical Review for December 1785), called Baron Munchausen* s 
Narrative of his Marvellous Travels and Campaigns in Russia. 
No copy is known to exist, but a second edition (apparently 
identical) was printed"at Oxford early in 1786. The publisher 
of both these editions was a certain Smith, and he then sold it 
to another bookseller named Kearsley, who brought out in 
1786 an enlarged edition (the additions to which were stated in 
the 7th edition not to be by the original author), with illustra- 
tions under the title of Gulliver Revived: the Singular Travels, 
Campaigns, Voyages, and Sporting Adventures of Baron Munnik- 
houson, commonly pronounced Munchai(sen; as he relates them 
over a bottle when surrounded by his friends. Four editions 
rapidly succeeded, and a free German translation by the poet 
Gottfried August Burger, from the fifth edition, was printed 
at Gottingen in 1786. The seventh English edition (1793), 
which is the usual text, has the moral sub-title, Or the Vice of 
Lying properly exposed, and had further new additions. In 1 792 a 
Sequel appeared, dedicated to James Bruce, the African traveller, 
whose Travels to Discover the Nile (1790) had led to incredulity 
and ridicule. As time went on Munchausen increased in popu- 
larity and was translated into many languages. Continuations 
were published, and new illustrations provided (e.g. by T. 
Rowlandson, 1809; A. Crowquill, 1859; A. Cruikshank, 1869; the 
French artist Richard, 1878; Gustave Dore, 1862; W. Strang 
and J. B. Clark, 1895). The theme of Baron Munchausen, 
the " drawer of the long-bow "■ par excellence, has become part 
of the common stock of the world's story-telling. 

The original author was at first unknown, and until 1824 
he was generally identified with Burger, who made the -German 
translation of 1786. But Burger's biographer, Karl von Rein- 
hard, in the Berlin Gesellschafter of November 1824, set the 
matter at rest by stating that the real author was Rudolf Erich 
Raspe (q.v.). Raspe had apparently become acquainted at 
Gottingen with Hieronymus Karl Friedrich, Freiherr von 
Munchhausen, of Bodenwerder in Hanover. This Freiherr von 
Munchhausen (1 720-1 797) had been in the Russian service and 



MUNCH-BELLINGHAUSEN— MUNDAS 



served against the Turks, and on retiring in 1760 he lived on 
his estates at Bodenwerder and used to amuse himself and his 
friends, and puzzle the quidnuncs and the dull-witted, by- 
relating extraordinary instances of his prowess as soldier and 
sportsman. His stories hecame a byword among his circle, 
and Raspe, when hard up for a living in London, utilized the 
suggestion for his little brochure. But his narrative owed much 
also to such sources, known to Raspe, as Heinrich BebePs 
Facetiae bebelianae- (1508), J. P. Lange's Deliciae academicae 
(1665), a section of which is called Mendacia ridicula, 
Castiglione's Cortcgiano (1528), the Travels of the Finkenritter y 
attributed to Lorenz von Lauterbach in the 16th century, and 
other works of this sort. Raspe can only be held responsible 
for the nucleus of the book; the additions were made by book- 
sellers' hacks, from such sources as Lucian's Vera historia y or 
the Voyages imaginaires (1787), while suggestions were taken 
from Baron de Tott's Memoirs (Eng. trans. 1785), the contem- 
porary aeronautical feats of Montgolfier and Blanchard, and any 
topical " sensations " of the moment, such as Bruce's explora- 
tions in Africa. Munchausen is thus a medley, as we have 
it, a classical instance of the fantastical mendacious literary 
genre. 

See the introduction by T. Seccombe to Lawrence and Bullen's 
edition of 1895. Adolf Ellisen, whose father visited Freiherr von 
Miinchhausen in 1795 and found him very uncommunicative, brought 
out a German edition in 1849, with a valuable essay on pseudology 
in general. There is useful material in Carl Muller-Fraureuth's Dte 
deutscken LUgendichtungen auf Miinchhausen (1881) and in Griesbach's 
edition of Burger's translation (1890). 

MUNCH-BELLINGHAUSEN, ELIGIUS FRANZ JOSEPH, 

Freiherr von (1806-1871), Austrian poet and dramatist (who 
wrote under the pseudonym " Friedrich Halm *'), was born at 
Cracow on the 2nd of April 1806, the son of a district judge. 
Educated at first at a private school in Vienna, he. afterwards 
attended lectures at the university, and in 1826, at the early 
age of twenty,, married and entered the government service. 
In 1840 he became Regierungsrat, in 1845 Hofrat and custodian 
of the royal library, in 1861 life member of the Austrian Herren- 
haus (upper chamber), and from 1869 to 1871 was intendant 
of the two court theatres in Vienna. He died at Hiitteldorf 
near Vienna on the 22nd of May 1871. Miinch-Bellinghausen's 
dramas, among them notably Griseldis (1835; publ. 1837; nth 
ed., 1896), Der Adept (1836; publ. 1838), Camoens (1838), Der 
Sohn der Wildnis (1842; 10th ed., 1896), and Der Fechter von 
Ravenna (1854; publ. 1857; 6th ed., 1894), are distinguished by 
elegance of language, melodious versification and clever construc- 
tion, and were for a time exceedingly popular. 

His poems, Gedichle, were published in Stuttgart, 1850 (new ed.i 
Vienna, 1877). His works, Sdrntliche Werke, were published in 
eight volumes (1856-1864), to which four posthumous volumes were 
added in 1872. Ausgewdhlte Werke, ed. by A. Schlossar, 4 vols. 
(1904). See F. Pachler, Jugend und Lehrjahre des Dichters F. Halm 
(1877); J. Simiani, Gedenkbldtter an F. Halm (1873). Halm's 
correspondence with Enk von der Burg has been published by 
R. Schachinger (1890). 

MUNCIE, a city and the county-seat of Delaware county, 
Indiana, U.S.A., on the West Fork of the White river, about 
57 m. N.E. of Indianapolis. Pop. (1880), 5210; (1800), 11,345; 
(1900) 20,942, of whom 1235 were foreign-born; (1910 census) 
24,005. It is served by the Central Indiana, the Chicago, 
Cincinnati & Louisville, the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago & 
St Louis, the Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, Chicago & St Louis, the Fort 
Wayne, Cincinnati & Louisville, and the Lake Erie & Western 
railways, and by the Indiana Union Traction, the Dayton & 
Muncie Traction, and the Muncie & Portland Traction (electric 
inter-urban) railways. The city is built on level ground (altitude 
950 ft.), and has an attractive residential section. It is one 
of the principal manufacturing centres in Indiana, owing largely 
to its situation in the natural gas belt. In 1900 and in 1905 
it was the largest producer of glass and glassware in the 
United States, the value of its product in 1905 being $2,344,462. 
Muncie (named after the Munsee Indians, one of the three 
principal divisions of the Delawares) was settled about 1833 
and was chartered as a city in 1865. 



MUNDAS. The Munda (Mun^a) family is the least numerous 
of the linguistic families of India. It comprises several dialects 
spoken in the two Chota Nagpur plateaux, the adjoining districts 
of Madras and the Central Provinces, and in the Mahadeo hills. 
The number of speakers of the various dialects, according to 
the census of 1901, arc as follow: Santall, 1,795,113; Mundari, 
460,744; Bhumij, 111,304; Birhar, 526; Koda, 23,873; Ho, 
371,860; Turf, 3880; Asuri, 4894; Korwa, 16,442; Korku, 87,675; 
Kharia, 82,506; Juang, 10,853; Savara, 157,136; Gadaba, 37,230; 
total, 3,164,036. Santall, Mundari, Bhumij, Birhar, Koda, Ho, 
Turf, Asuri and Korwa are only slightly differing forms of one 
and the same language, which can be called Kherwari, a name 
borrowed from Santall tradition. Kherwari is the principal 
Munda language, and quite 88% of all the speakers of Munda 
tongues belong to it. The Korwa dialect, spoken in the western 
part of Chota Nagpur, connects Kherwari with the remaining 
Munda languages. Of these it is most closely related to the 
Kurku language of the Mahadeo hills in the Central Provinces. 
Kurku, in its turn, in important points agrees with Kharia and 
Juang, and Kharia leads over to Savara and Gadaba. The 
two last-mentioned forms of speech, which are spoken in the 
north-east of the Madras Presidency, have been much influenced 
by Dravidian languages. 

The Munda dialects are not in sole possession of the territory 
where they are spoken. They are, as a rule, only found in the 
hills and jungles, while the plains and valleys are inhabited by 
people speaking some Aryan language. When brought into 
close contact with Aryan tongues the Munda forms of speech are 
apt to give way, and in the course of time they have been 
partly superseded by Aryan dialects. There are accordingly 
some Aryanized tribes in northern India who have formerly 
belonged to the Munda stock. Such are the Cheros of Behar 
and Chota Nagpur, the Kherwars, who are found in the same 
localities, in Mirzapur and elsewhere, the Savaras, who formerly 
extended as far north as Shahabad, and others. It seems 
possible to trace an old Munda element in some Tibeto-Burman 
dialects spoken in the Himalayas from Bashahr eastwards. 

By race the Mundas are Dravidians, and their language was 
likewise long considered as a member of the Dravidian family. 
Max Muller was the first to distinguish the two families. He 
also coined the name Munda for the smaller of them, which has 
later on often been spoken of under other denominations, such as 
Kolarian and Kherwarian. The Dravidian race is generally 
considered as the aboriginal population of southern India. The 
Mundas, who do not appear to have extended much farther 
towards the south than at present, must have mixed with 
the Dravidians from very early times. The so-called Nahall 
dialect of the Mahadeo hills seems to have been originally a 
Munda form of speech which has come under Dravidian influ- 
ence, and finally passed under the spell of Aryan tongues. The 
same is perhaps the case with the numerous dialects spoken by 
the Bhils. At all events, Munda languages have apparently 
been spoken over a wide area in central and north India. They 
were then early superseded by Dravidian and Aryan dialects, 
and at the present day only scanty remnants are found in the 
hills and jungles of Bengal and the Central Provinces. 

Though the Munda family is not connected with any other 
languages in India proper, it does not form an isolated group. It 
belongs to a widely spread family, which extends from India in 
the west to Easter Island in the eastern Pacific-in the east. In 
the first place, we find a connected language spoken by the 
Khasis of the Khasi hills in Assam. Then follow the Mon- 
Khmer languages of Farther India, the dialects spoken by the 
aboriginal inhabitants of the Malay Peninsula, the Nancowry 
of the Nicobars, and, finally, the numerous dialects of Austro- 
nesia, viz. Indonesic, Melanesic, Polynesic, and so on. Among 
the various members of this vast group the Munda languages 
are most closely related to the Mon-Khmer family of Farther 
India. Kurku, Kharia, Juang, Savara and Gadaba are more 
closely related to that family than is Kherwari, the principal 
Munda form of speech. 

We do not know if the Mundas entered India from without. 



MUNDAY 



If so, they can only have immigrated from the east. At all 
events they must have been settled in India from a very early 
period. The Sabaras, the ancestors of the Savaras, are already 
mentioned in old Vedic literature. The Munda languages 
seem to have been influenced by Dravidian and Aryan forms 
of speech. In most characteristics, however, they differ widely 
from the neighbouring tongues. 

The Munda languages abound in vowels, and also possess a richly 
developed system of consonants. Like the Dravidian languages, 
they avoid beginning a word with more than one consonant. While 
those latter forms of speech shrink from pronouncing a short conso- 
nant at the end of words, the Mundas have the opposite tendency, 
viz. to shorten such sounds still more. The usual stopped consonants 
— viz. k, c {i.e. English ch), t and p — are formed by stopping the 
current of breath at different points in the mouth, and then letting it 
pass out with a kind of explosion. In the Munda language this 
operation can be abruptly checked half-way, so that the breath does 
not touch the organs of speech in passing out. The result is a sound 
that makes an abrupt impression on the ear, and has been described 
as an abrupt tone. Such sounds are common in the Munda languages. 
They are usually written k', c\ t y and p\ Similar sounds are also 
found in the Mon- Khmer languages and in Indo-Chinese. 

The vowels of consecutive syllables to a certain extent approach 
each other in sound. Thus in Kherwari the open sounds a (nearly 
English a in all) and a (the a in care) agree with each other and not 
with the corresponding close sounds o (the o in pole) and e (the e in 
pen). The Santali passive suffix ok* accordingly becomes ak* after 
a or & ; compare sdn-dk\ go, but dal-ok', to be struck. 

Words are formed from monosyllabic bases by means of various 
additions, suffixes (such as are added after the base), prefixes (which 
precede the base) and infixes (which are inserted into the base itself). 
Suffixes play a great r61e in the inflexion of words, while prefixes and 
infixes are of greater importance as formative additions. Compare 
Kurku k~on, Savara on, son ; Kharia ro-mong, Kherwari mu, nose ; 
Santali bor, to fear ; bo-to-r, fear ; dal, to strike ; da-pa-l, to strike each 
other. 

The various classes of words are not clearly distinguished. The 
same base can often be used as a noun, an adjective or a verb. The 
words simply denote some being, object, quality, action or the like, 
but they do not tell us how they are conceived. 

Inflexion is effected in the usual agglutinative way by means of 
additions which are " glued " or joined to the unchanged base. 
In many respects, however, Munda inflexion has struck out peculiar 
lines. Thus there is no grammatical distinction of gender. Nouns 
can be divided into two classes^ viz. those that denote animate 
beings and those that denote inanimate objects respectively. There 
are three numbers — the singular, the dual and the plural. On the 
other hand, there are no real cases, at least in the most typical 
Munda languages. The direct and the indirect object are indicated 
by means of certain additions to the verb. Certain relations in 
time and space, however, are indicated by means of suffixes, which 
have probably from the beginning been separate words with a definite 
meaning. The genitive, which can be considered as an adjective 
preceding the governing word, is often derived from such forms 
denoting locality. Compare Santali h&r-ra, in a man; h&r-rdn, of 
a man. 

Higher numbers are counted in twenties, and not in tens as in the 
Dravidian languages. 

The pronouns abound in different forms. Thus there are double 
sets of the dual and the plural of the pronoun of the first person, one 
including and the other excluding the person addressed. The Rev. 
A. NoUrott aptly illustrates the importance of this distinction by 
remarking: how it is necessary to use the exclusive form if telling the 
servant that " we shall dine at seven." Otherwise the speaker will 
invite the servant to partake of the meal. In addition to the usual 
personal pronouns there arc also short forms, used as suffixes and 
infixes, which denote a direct object, an indirect object, or a genitive. 
There is a corresponding richness in the case of demonstrative 
pronouns. Thus the pronoun " that " in Santali has different forms 
to denote a living being, an inanimate object, something seen, some- 
thing heard, and so on. On the other hand, there is no relative 
pronoun, the want being supplied by the use of indefinite forms of the 
verbal bases, which can in this connexion be called relative participles. 

The most characteristic feature of Munda grammar is the verb, 
especially in Kherwari. Every independent word can perform the 
function of a verb, and every verbal form can, in its turn, be used as a 
noun or an adjective. The bases of the different tenses can there- 
fore be described as indifferent words which can be used as a noun, 
as an adjective, and as a verb, but which are in reality none of them. 
Each denotes simply the root meaning as modified by time. Thus 
in Santali the base dal-ket % , struck, which is formed from the base 
dal, by adding the suffix kef of the active past, can be used as a noun 
( compare dal-ket'-ko, strikers, those that struck), as an adjective 
(compare dal-ket'-hdr, struck man, the man that struck), and as a 
verb. In the last case it is necessary to add an a if the action really 
takes place; thus, dal-ket'-a, somebody struck. 

It has already been remarked that the cases of the direct and 
indirect object are indicated by adding forms of the personal 



pronouns to the verb. Such pronominal affixes are inserted before 
the assertive particle a. Thus the affix denoting a direct object of the 
third person singular is e, and by inserting it in dal-keV-a we arrive 
at a form dal-ked-e-a, somebody struck him. Similar affixes can be 
added to denote that the object or subject of an action belongs to 
somebody. Thus Santali kdpdn-in-e dal-keV-tako-tin-a, son-my-he 
struck-theirs-minc, my son who belongs to me struck theirs. 

In a sentence such as hat kord-e dal-ked-e-a, man boy-he struck- 
him, the man struck the boy, the Santals first put together the ideas 
man, boy, and a striking in the past. Then the e tells us that the 
striking affects the boy, and finally the -a indicates that the whole 
action really takes place. It will be seen that a single verbal form 
in this way often corresponds to a whole sentence or a scries of sen- 
tences in other languages. If we add that the most developed 
Munda languages possess different bases for the active, the middle 
and the passive, that there are different causal, intensive and recipro- 
cal bases, which are conjugated throughout, and that the person of 
the subject is often indicated in the verb, it will be understood that 
Munda conjugation presents a somewhat bewildering aspect. It 
is, however, quite regular throughout, and once the mind becomes 
accustomed to these peculiarities, they do not present any difficulty 
to the understanding.

MUNDAY (or Monday), ANTHONY (c. 1553-1633), English 
dramatist and miscellaneous writer, son of Christopher Monday, 
a London draper, was born in 1 553-1 554. He had already 
appeared on the stage when in 1576 he bound himself 
apprentice for eight years to John Allde, the stationer, an 
engagement from which he was speedily released, for in 
1578 he was in Rome. In the opening lines of his English 
Romayne Lyfe (1582) he avers that in going abroad he 
was actuated solely by a desire to see strange countries and 
to learn foreign languages; but he must be regarded, if 
not as a spy sent to report on the English Jesuit College in 
Rome, as a journalist who meant to make literary capital out of 
the designs of the English Catholics resident in France and 
Italy. He says that he and his companion, Thomas Nowell, 
were robbed of all they possessed on the road from Boulogne to 
Amiens, where they were kindly received by an English priest, 
who entrusted them with letters to be delivered in Reims. 
These they handed over to the English ambassador in Paris, 
where under a false name, as the son of a well-known English 
Catholic, Munday gained recommendations which secured his 
reception at the English College in Rome. He was treated with 
special kindness by the rector, Dr Morris, for the sake of his 
supposed father. He gives a detailed account of the routine of 
the place, of the dispute between the English and Welsh students, 
of the carnival at Rome, and finally of the martyrdom of Richard 
Atkins (? 1550-1581). He returned to England in 1578-1579, and 
became an actor again, being a member of the Earl of Oxford's 
company between 1579 and 1584. In a Catholic tract entitled 

A True Reporte of the death of M. Campion (1581), Munday 

is accused of having deceived his master Allde, a charge which 
he refuted by publishing Allde's signed declaration to the con- 
trary, and he is also said to have been hissed off the stage. He 
was one of the chief witnesses against Edmund Campion and 
his associates, and wrote about this time five anti-popish 
pamphlets, among them the savage and bigoted tract entitled A 

Discoveric of Edmund Campion and his Confederales whereto 

is added the execution of Edmund Campion, Raphe Sherwin, and 
Alexander Brian, the first part of which was read aloud from 
the scaffold at Campion's death in December 1 581. His political 
services against the Catholics were rewarded in 1 584 by the post 
of messenger to her Majesty's chamber, and from this time he 
seems to have ceased to appear on the stage. In 1 598-1 599, when 
he travelled with the earl of Pembroke's men in the Low 
Countries, it was in the capacity of playwright to furbish up old 
plays. He devoted himself to writing for the booksellers and 
the theatres, compiling religious works, translating Amadis de 
Gaule and other French romances, and putting words to popular 
airs. He was the chief pageant- writer for the City from 1605 



MUNDELLA— MUNDT 



to 1616, and it is likely that he supplied most of the pageants 
between 1592 and 1605, of which no authentic record has been 
kept. It is by these entertainments of his, which rivalled in 
success those of Ben Jonson and Middleton, that he won his 
greatest fame; but of all the achievements of his versatile talent 
the only one that was noted in his epitaph in St Stephens, 
Coleman Street, London, where he was buried on the 10th of 
August 1633, was his enlarged edition (1 618) of Stow's Survey of 
London. In some of his pageants he signs himself " citizen and 
draper of London," and in his later years he is said to have 
followed his father's trade. 

Of the eighteen plays between the dates of 1584 and 1602 which 
are assigned to Munday in collaboration with Henry Chettle, Michael 
Drayton, Thomas Dekker and other dramatists, only four are extant. 
John a Kent and John a Cumber f dated 1595, is supposed to be the 
same as Wiseman of West Chester , produced by the Admiral's men 
at the Rae Theatre on the 2nd of December 1594. A ballad of British 
Sidanen, on which it may have been founded, was entered at 
Stationers' Ha!l in 1579. The Downfall of Robert Earl of Huntingdon, 
afterwards called Robin Hood of merrie Snerwodde (acted in February 
1599) was followed in the same month by a second part, The Death 
of Robert Earl of Huntingdon (printed 1601), in which he collaborated 
with Henry Chettle. Munday also had a share with Michael Dray- 
ton, Robert Wilson and Richard Hath way in the First Part of the 
history of the life of Sir John OldcasUe (acted 1599)* which was 
printed in 1600, with the name of William Shakespeare, which was 
speedily withdrawn, on the^ title page. William Webbe {Discourse 
of English Poetrie, 1586) praised him for his pastorals, of which there 
remains only the title, Sweet Sobs and Amorous Complaints of Shep- 
herds and Nymphs; and Francis Meres (Palladis Tamia, 1598) gives 
him among dramatic writers the exaggerated praise of being " our 
best plotter." Ben Jonson ridiculed him in TIte Case is Altered 
as Antonio Balladino, pageant poet. Munday's works usuaUy 
appeared under his own name, but he sometimes used the pseudonym 
of ,( Lazarus Piot." A. H. Bullen identifies him with the u Shepherd 
Tony " who contributed " Beauty sat bathing by a spring " and six 
other lyrics to England's Helicon (ed. Bullen, 1899, p. 15). 

The completest account of Anthony Munday is T. Seccombe's 
article in the Diet. Nat. Biog. A life and bibliography are prefixed 
to the Shakespeare Society s reprint of John a Kent and John a 
Cumber (ed. J. P. Collier, 1851). His two " Robin Hood " plays 
were edited by J. P. Collier in Old Plays (1828), and his English 
Romayne Lyfe was printed in the Harleian Miscellany, vii. 136 seq. 
(ed. Park, 1811). For an account of his city pageants see F. W. 
Fairholt, Lord Mayor's Pageants (Percy Soc., No. 38, 1843). 

MUNDELLA, ANTHONY JOHN (1825-1897), English educa- 
tional and industrial reformer, of Italian extraction, was born at 
Leicester in 1825. After a few years spent at an elementary 
school, he was apprenticed to a hosier at the age of eleven; He 
afterwards became successful in business in Nottingham, filled 
several civic offices, and was known for his philanthropy. He 
was sheriff of Nottingham in 1853, and in 1859 organized the 
first courts of arbitration for the settlement of disputes between 
masters and men. In November 1868 he was returned to 
parliament for Sheffield as an advanced Liberal. He represented 
that constituency until November 1885, when he was returned 
for the Brightside division of Sheffield, which he continued to 
represent until his death. In the Gladstone ministry of 1880 
Mundella was vice-president of the council, and shortly after- 
wards was nominated fourth charity commissioner for England 
and Wales. In February 1886 he was appointed president 
of the board of trade, with a seat in the cabinet, and was sworn 
a member of the privy council. In August 1892, when the 
Liberals again came into power, Mundella was again appointed 
president of the board of trade, and he continued in this 
position until 1894, when he resigned office. His resignation 
was brought about by his connexion wfth a financial company 
which went into liquidation in circumstances calling for the 
official intervention of the board of trade. However innocent 
his own connexion with the company was, it involved him in 
unpleasant public discussion, and his position became untenable. 
Having made a close study of the educational systems of Germany 
and Switzerland, Mundella was an early advocate of compulsory 
education in England. He rendered valuable service in con- 
nexion with the Elementary Education Act of 1870, and the 
educational code of 1882, which became known as the " Mundella 
Code," marked a new departure in the regulation of public 
elementary schools and the conditions of the Government 



grants. To his initiative was chiefly due the Factory Act 
of 1875, which established a ten-hours day for women and 
children in textile factories; and the Conspiracy Act, which 
removed certain restrictions on trade unions. It was he 
also who established the labour department of the board of 
trade and founded the Labour Gazette. He introduced and 
passed bills for the better protection of women and children in 
brickyards and for the limitation of their labours in factories; 
and he effected substantial improvements in the Mines Regula- 
tion Bill, and was the author of much other useful legislation. 
In recognition of his efforts, a marble bust of himself, by Boehm, 
subscribed for by 80,000 factory workers, chiefly women and 
children, was presented to Mrs Mundella. He died in London 
on the 21st of July 1897. 

MUNDEN, JOSEPH SHEPHERD (1 758-1832), English actor, 
was the son of a London poulterer, and ran away from home 
to join a strolling company. He had a long provincial experience 
as actor and manager. His first London appearance was in 
1790 at Covent Garden, where he practically remained until 
181 1, becoming the leading comedian of his day. In 1813 he 
was at Drury Lane. He retired in 1824, and died on the 6th 
of February 1832. 

MUNDEN, a town of Germany, in the Prussian province of 
Hanover, picturesquely situated at the confluence of the Fulda 
and the Werra, 21 m. N.E. of Cassel by rail. Pop. (1905), 
10,755. It is an ancient place, municipal rights having been 
granted to it in 1 247. A few ruins of its former walls still survive. 
The large Lutheran church of St Blasius (i4tb-i5th centuries) 
contains the sarcophagus of Duke Eric of Brunswick-Calenberg 
(d. 1540). The 13th-century Church of St Aegidius was injured 
in the siege of 1625-26 but was subsequently restored. There is 
a new Roman Catholic church (1895). The town hall (1619), 
and the ducal castle, built by Duke Eric II. about 1570, and 
rebuilt in 1898, are the principal secular buildings. In the 
latter is the municipal museum. There are various small 
industries and a trade in timber. Miinden, often called " Hanno- 
versch-Munden " (i.e. Hanoverian Miinden), to distinguish it 
from Prussian Minden, was founded by the landgraves of 
Thuringia, and passed in 1247 to the house of Brunswick. It 
was for a time the residence of the dukes of Brunswick-Luneburg. 
In 1626 it was destroyed by Tilly.

MUNDRUCUS, a tribe of South American Indians, one of the 
most powerful tribes on the Amazon. In 1788 they completely 
defeated their ancient enemies the Muras! After 1803 they 
lived at peace with the Brazilians, and many are civilized. 

MUNDT, THEODOR (1808-1861), German author, was born 
at Potsdam on the 19th of September 1808. Having studied 
philology and philosophy at Berlin, he settled in 1832 at Leipzig, 
as a journalist, and was subjected to a rigorous police supervision. 
In 1839 he married Klara Miiller (1814-1873), who under the 
name of Luise Miihlbach became a popular novelist, and he 
removed in the same year to Berlin. Here his intention of 
entering upon an academical career was for a time thwarted 
by his collision with the Prussian press laws. In 1842, however, 
he was permitted to establish himself as privatdocent. In 1848 
he was appointed professor of literature and history in Breslau, 
and in 1850 ordinary professor and librarian in Berlin; there he 
died on the 30th of November 1861. Mundt wrote extensively 
on aesthetic subjects, and as a critic he had considerable influence 
in his time. Prominent among his works are Die Kunst n der 
deutscken Prosa (1837); Geschichle der Liter atur der Gegenwart 
(1840); Aesthetik; die Idee der Schonkeit und des Kunstwerks im 
Lichte unserer Zeit (1845, new ed. 1868); Die Gotterwelt der 
alten Volker (1846, new ed. 1854). He also wrote several 
historical novels; Thomas Miinzer (1841); Mendoza, der Valer 
der Schelmen (1847) and Die Matadore (1850). But perhaps 
Mundt's chief title to fame was his part in the emancipation of 
women, a theme which he elaborated in his Madonna, Unter- 
haltungen mil einer Heiligen (1835). 



MUNICH 






MUNICH (Ger. Miinchen), a city of Germany, capital of 
the kingdom 01 Bavaria, and the third largest town in the 
German Empire. It is situated on an elevated plain, on the 
river Isar, 25 m. N. of the foot-hills of the Alps, about midway 
between Strassburg and Vienna. Owing to its lofty site (1700 ft. 
above the sea) and the proximity of the Alps, the climate is 
changeable, and its mean annual temperature, 40° to 50 F., 
is little higher than that of many places much farther to the 
north. The annual rainfall is nearly 30 in. Munich lies at 
the centre of an important network of railways connecting 
it directly with Strassburg (for Paris), Cologne, Leipzig, Berlin, 
Rosenheim (for Vienna) and Innsbruck (for Italy via the Brenner 
pass), which converge in a central station. 

Munich is divided into twenty-four municipal districts, nine- 
teen of which, including the old town, lie on the left bank of the 
Isar, while the suburban districts of Au, Haidhausen, Giesing, 
Bogenhausen and Ramersdorf are on the opposite bank. ' The 
old town, containing many narrow and irregular streets, forms a 
semicircle with its diameter towards the river, while round 
its periphery has sprung up the greater part of modern Munich, 
including the handsome Maximilian and Ludwig districts. 
The walls with which Munich was formerly surrounded have 
been pulled down, but some of the gates have been left. The 
most interesting is the Isartor and the Karlstor, restored in 
1835 and adorned with frescoes. The Sieges tor (or gate of 
victory) is a modern imitation of the arch of Constantine at 
Rome, while the stately Propylaea, built in 1854-1862, is a 
reproduction of the gates of the Athenian Acropolis. 

Munich owes its architectural magnificence largely to Louis I. 
of Bavaria, who ascended the throne in 1825, and his successors; 
while its collections of art entitle it to rank with Dresden and 
Berlin. Most of the modern buildings have been erected after 
celebrated prototypes of other countries and eras, so that, as 
has been said by Moriz Carriere, a walk through Munich affords 
a picture of the architecture and art of two thousand years. 
In carrying out his plans Louis I. was seconded by the architect 
Leo von Klenze, while the external decorations of painting and 
sculpture were mainly designed by Peter von Cornelius, Wilhelm 
von Kaulbach and Schwanthaler. As opportunity offers, the 
narrow streets of the older city are converted into broad, straight 
boulevards, lined with palatial mansions and public buildings. 
The hygienic improvement effected by these changes, and by 
a new and excellent water supply, is shown by the mortality 
averages — 40*4 per thousand in 1871-1875, 30-4 per thousand 
in 1 881-1885, and 20-5 per thousand in 1 903-1904. The archi- 
tectural style which has been principally followed in the later 
public buildings, among them the law courts, finished in 1897, 
the German bank, St Martin's hospital, as well as in numerous 
private dwellings, is the Italian and French Rococo, or Renais- 
sance, adapted to the traditions of Munich architecture in the 
17th and 18th centuries. A large proportion of the most notable 
buildings in Munich are in two streets, the Ludwigstrasse and 
the Maximilianstrasse, the creations of the monarchs whose 
names they bear. The former, three-quarters of a mile long 
and 40 yds. wide, chiefly contains buildings in the Renaissance 
style by Friedrich von Gartner. The most striking of these are 
the palaces of Duke Max and of Prince Luitpold; the Odeon, a 
large building for concerts, adorned with frescoes and marble 
busts; the war office; the royal library, in the Florentine palatial 
style; the Ludwigskirche, a successful reproduction of the 
Italian Romanesque style, built in 1829-1844, and containing 
a huge fresco of the Last Judgment by Cornelius; the blind 
asylum; and, lastly, the university. At one end this street is 
terminated by the Siegestor, while at the other is the Feldher- 
renhalle (or hall of the marshals), a copy of the Loggia dei Lanzi 
at Florence, containing statues of Tilly and Wrede by Schwan- 
thaler. Adjacent is the church of the Theatines, an imposing 
though somewhat over-ornamented example of the Italian 
Rococo style; it contains the royal burial vault. In the Maxi- 
milianstrasse, which extends from Haidhausen on the right bank 
of the Isar to the Max-Joseph Platz, King Maximilian II. tried 
to introduce an entirely novel style of domestic architecture, 



formed by the combination of older forms. At the east end it 
is closed by the Maximilianeum, an extensive and imposing 
edifice, adorned externally with large sculptural groups and 
internally with huge paintings representing the chief scenes in 
the history of the world. Descending the street, towards the 
west are passed in succession the old buildings of the Bavarian 
national museum, the government buildings in which the Com- 
posite style of Maximilian has been most consistently carried 
out, and the mint. On the north side of the Max- Joseph Platz 
lies the royal palace, consisting of the Alte Residenz, the 
Konigsbau, and the Festsaalbau. The Alte Residenz dates 
from 1601 to 1616; its apartments are handsomely fitted up 
in the Rococo style, and the private chapel and the treasury 
contain several crowns and many other interesting and valuable 
objects. The Festsaalbau, erected by Klenze in the Italian 
Renaissance style, is adorned with mural paintings and sculp- 
tures, while the Konigsbau, a reduced copy of the Pitti Palace 
at Florence, contains a series of admirable frescoes from the 
Niebelungenlied by Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld. Adjoining 
f the palace are two theatres, the Residenz or private theatre, 
and the handsome Hoftheater, accommodating 2500 spectators. 
The Allerheiligen-Hofkirche, or court-church, is in the Byzantine 
style, with a Romanesque facade. 

The Ludwigstrasse and the Maximilianstrasse both end at 
no great distance from the Frauenplatz in the centre of the old 
town. On this square stands the Frauenkirche, the cathedral 
church of the archbishop of Munich-Freising, with its lofty cupola 
capped towers dominating the whole town. It is imposing from 
its size, and interesting as one of the few examples of indigenous 
Munich art. On the adjacent Marienplatz are the old town- 
hall, dating from the 14th century and restored in 1865, and 
the new town-hall, the latter a magnificent modern Gothic 
erection, freely embellished with statues, frescoes, and stained- 
glass windows, and enlarged in 1900-1905. The column in the 
centre of the square was erected in 1638, to commemorate the 
defeat of the Protestants near Prague by the Bavarians during 
the Thirty Years' War. 

Among the other churches of Munich the chief place is due to 
St Boniface's, an admirable copy of an early Christian basilica. 
It is adorned with a cycle of religious paintings by Heinrich 
von Hess (1798-1863), and the dome is supported by sixty- 
four monoliths of grey Tyrolese marble. • The parish church of 
Au, in the Early Gothic style, contains gigantic stained-glass 
windows and some excellent wood-carving; and the church 
of St John in Haidhausen is another fine Gothic structure. 
St Michael's in the Renaissance style, erected for the Jesuits in 
1 583-1 595, contains the monument of Eugene Beauharnais by 
Thorwaldsen. The facade is divided into storeys, and the 
general effect is by no means ecclesiastical. St Peter's is inter- 
esting as the oldest church in Munich (12th century), though no 
trace of the original basilica remains. Among newer churches 
the most noticeable are the Evangelical church of St Luke, a 
Transitional building, with an imposing dome, finished in 1896, 
and the Gothic parochial church of the Giesing suburb, with a 
tower 312 ft. high and rich interior decorations (1 866-1 884). 

The valuable collections of art are enshrined in handsome 
buildings, mostly in the Maximilian suburb on the north side 
of the town. The old Pinakothek, erected by Klenze in 1826- 
1836, and somewhat resembling the Vatican, is embellished 
externally with frescoes by Cornelius and with statues of twenty- 
four celebrated painters from sketches by Schwanthaler. It 
contains a valuable and extensive collection of pictures by the 
earlier masters, the chief treasures being the early German 
and Flemish works and the unusually numerous examples of 
Rubens. It also affords accommodation to more than 300,000 
engravings, over 20,000 drawings, and a large collection of 
vases. Opposite stands the new Pinakothek, built 1 846-1 853, 
the frescoes on which, designed by Kaulbach, show the effects of 
wind and weather. It is devoted to works by painters of the 
last century, among which Karl Rottmann's Greek landscapes 
are perhaps the most important. The Glyptothek, a building by 
Klenze in the Ionic style, and adorned with several groups and 



MUNICH 



single statues, contains a valuable series of sculptures, extending 
from Assyrian and Egyptian monuments down to works by 
Thorwaldsen and other modern masters. The celebrated 
Aeginetan marbles preserved here were found in the island of 
Aegina in 1811. Opposite the Glyptothek stands the exhibition 
building, in the Corinthian style, it was finished in 1845, and is 
used for periodic exhibitions of art. In addition to the museum 
of plaster casts, the Anliquarium (a collection of Egyptian, Greek 
and Roman antiquities under the roof of the new Pinakothek) 
and the Maillinger collection, connected with the historical 
museum, Munich also contains several private galleries. Fore- 
most among these stand the Schack Gallery, bequeathed by 
the founder, Count Adolph von Schack, to the emperor William 
II. in 1894, rich in works by modern German masters, and the 
Lotzbeck collection of sculptures and paintings. Other struc- 
tures and institutions are the new buildings of the art association; 
the academy of the plastic arts (1874-1885), in the Renaissance 
style; and the royal arsenal (Zeughaus) with the military 
museum. The Schwanthaler museum contains models of most 
of the great sculptor's works. 

The immense scientific collection in the Bavarian national 
museum, illustrative of the march of progress from the Roman 
period down tp the present day, compares in completeness 
with the similar collections at South Kensington and the Mus6e 
de Cluny. The building which now houses this collection was 
erected in 1 894-1900. On the walls is a series of well-executed 
frescoes of scenes from Bavarian history, occupying a space of 
16,000 sq. ft. The ethnographical museum, the cabinet of 
coins, and the collections of fossils, minerals, and physical 
and optical instruments, are also worthy of mention. The art 
union, the oldest and most extensive in Germany, possesses a 
good collection of modern works. The chief place among the 
scientific institutions is due to the academy of science, founded 
in 1759. The royal library contains over 1,300,000 printed 
volumes and 30,000 manuscripts. The observatory is equipped 
with instruments by the celebrated Josef Fraunhofer. 

At the head of the educational institutions of Munich stands 
the university, founded at Ingolstadt in 1472, removed to 
Landshut in 1800, and transferred thence to Munich in 1826. 
In addition to the four usual faculties there is a fifth — of political 
economy. In connexion with the university are medical and 
other schools, a priests' seminary, and a library of 300,000 
volumes. The polytechnic institute (Teckniscke Hocksckule) in 
1899 acquired the privilege of conferring the degree of doctor 
of technical science. Munich contains several gymnasia or 
grammar-schools, a military academy, a veterinary college, an" 
agricultural college, a school for architects and builders, and 
several other technical schools, and a conservatory of music. 
The general prison in the suburb of Au is considered a model 
of its kind; and there is also a large military prison. Among 
other public buildings, the crystal palace (Glas-palasl), 765 ft. 
in length, erected for the great exhibition of 1854, is now used, 
as occasion requires, for temporary exhibitions. The Wittelsbach 
palace, built in 1 843-1850, in the Early English Pointed style, is 
one of the residences of the royal family. Among the numerous 
monuments with which the squares and streets are adorned, 
the most important are the colossal statue of Maximilian II. 
in the Maximilianstrasse, the equestrian statues of Louis I. and 
the elector Maximilian I., the obelisk erected to the 30,000 
Bavarians who perished in Napoleon's expedition to Moscow, 
the Wittelsbach fountain (1895), the monument commemorative 
of -the peace of 1871, and the marble statue of Justus Liebig, 
the chemist, set up in 1883. 

The English garden (Englischer Garten), to the north-east of 
the town, is 600 acres in extent, and was laid out by Count 
Rumford in imitation of an English park. On the opposite bank 
of the Isar, above and below the Maximilianeum, extend the 
Gasteig promenades, commanding fine views of the town. To 
the south-west of the town is the Theresienwiese, a large common 
where the popular festival is celebrated in October. Here is 
situated the Ruhmeshalle or hall of fame, a Doric colonnade 
containing busts of eminent Bavarians. In front of it is a 



colossal bronze statue of Bavaria, 170 ft. high, designed by 
Schwanthaler. The botanical garden, with its large palm-house, 
the Hofgarten, surrounded with arcades containing frescoes of 
Greek landscapes by Rottmann, and the Maximilian park to 
the east of the Isar, complete the list of public parks. 

The population of Munich in 1005 was 538,393. The per- 
manent garrison numbers about 10,000 men. Of the population, 
84% are Roman Catholic, 14% Protestants, and 2% Jews. 

Munich is the seat of the archbishop of Munich-Frcising 
and of the general Protestant consistory for Bavaria. About 
twenty newspapers are published here, including the Allgemeine 
Zeilung. Some of the festivals of the Roman Church are cele- 
brated with considerable pomp; and the people also cling to 
various national fetes, such as the Metzgersprung, the Schaffler- 
tanz, and the great October festival. 

Munich has long been celebrated for its artistic handicrafts, 
such as bronze-founding, glass-staining, silversmith's work, and 
wood-carving, while the astronomical instruments of Fraunhofer 
and the mathematical instruments of Traugott Lieberecht von 
Ertel (17 78-1858) are also widely known. Lithography, which 
was invented at Munich at the end of the 18th century, is 
extensively practised here. The other industrial products 
include wall-paper, railway plant, machinery, gloves and 
artificial flowers. The most characteristic industry, however, 
is brewing. Four important markets are held at Munich 
annually. The city is served by an extensive electric tramway 
system. 

History. — The Villa Munichen or Forum ad monachos, so 
called from the monkish owners of the ground on which it lay, 
was first called into prominence by Duke Henry the Lion, who 
established a mint here in 11 58, and made it the emporium for 
the salt coming from Hallein and Reichenhall. The Bavarian/ 
dukes of the Wittelsbach house occasionally resided at Munich, 
and in 1255 Duke Louis made it his capital, having previously 
surrounded it with walls and a moat. The town was almost 
entirely destroyed by fire in 1327, after which the emperor Louis 
the Bavarian, in recognition of the loyalty of the citizens, 
rebuilt it very much on the scale it retained down to the beginning 
of the 19th century. Among the succeeding rulers those who did 
most for the town in the erection of handsome buildings and the 
foundation of schools and scientific institutions were Albert V., 
William V., Maximilian I., Max Joseph. and Charles Theodore. 
In 1632 Munich was occupied by Gustavus Adolphus, and in 
1705, and again in 1742, it was in possession of the Austrians. 
In 1 791 the fortifications were razed. 

Munich's importance in the' history of art is entirely of modern 
growth, and may be dated from the acquisition of the Aeginetan 
marbles by Louis I., then crown prince, in 181 2. Among the 
eminent artists of this period whose names are more or less 
identified with Munich were Leo von Klenze (1784-1864), 
Joseph Daniel Ohlmuller (1 791-1839), Friedrich von Gartner 
(1792-1847), and Georg Friedrich Ziebland (1800-1873), the 
architects; Peter von Cornelius (1 783-1867), Wilhelm von Kaul- 
bach (1804-1874), Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld (1794-1872), 
and Karl Rottmann, the painters; and Ludwig von Schwanthaler, 
the sculptor. Munich is still the leading school of painting in 
Germany, but the romanticism of the earlier masters has been 
abandoned for drawing and colouring of a realistic character. 
Karl von Piloty (1826-1886) and Wilhelm Diez (1830-1907) long 
stood at the head of this school.

MUNICIPALITY— MUNICIPIUM 



MUNICIPALITY, a modern term (derived from Lat. muni- 
cipium; see below), now used both for a city or town which 
is organized for self-government tinder a municipal corporation, 
and also for the governing body itself. Such a corporation 
in Great Britain consists of a head as a mayor or provost, and 
of superior members, as aldermen and councillors, together with 
the simple corporators, who are represented by the governing 
body; it acts as a person by its common seal, and has a perpetual 
succession, with power to hold lands subject to the restrictions 
of the Mortmain laws; and it can sue or be sued. Where 
necessary for its primary objects, every corporation has power 
to make by-laws and to enforce them by penalties, provided they 
are not unjust or unreasonable or otherwise inconsistent with 
the objects of the charter or other instrument of foundation. 

See Borough, Commune, Corporation, Local Government, 
Finance, &c, and for details of the functions of the municipal 
government see the sections under the general headings of the 
different countries and the sections on the history of these countries. 

MUNICIPIUM (Lat. munus, a duty or privilege, caper e, to 
take), in ancient Rome, the term applied primarily to a status, 
a certain relation between individuals or communities and the 
Roman state; subsequently and in ordinary usage to a com- 
munity, standing in such a relation to Rome. Whether the 
name signifies the taking up of burdens or the acceptance of 
privileges is a disputed point. But as ancient authorities are 
unanimous in giving munus in this connexion the sense of 
" duty " or " service," it is probable that the chief feature 
of municipality was the performance of certain services to 
Rome. 1 This view is confirmed by all that we know about 
the towns to which the name was applied in republican times. 
The status had its origin in the conferment of citizenship upon 
Tusculum in 381 B.C. (Livy vi. 26; cf. Cic. pro Plane. 8, 19), 
and was widely extended in the settlement made by Rome at 
the close of the Latin War in 338 B.C. (see Rome, History). 
Italian towns were then divided into three classes: (1) Coloniae 
civium Romanorum, whose members had all the rights of citizen- 
ship; (2) municipia, which received partial citizenship; (3) foeder- 
atae civitates (including the so-called Latin colonies), which 
remained entirely separate from Rome, and stood in relations 
with her which were separately arranged by her for each state by 
treaty (foedus). The municipia stood in very different degrees 
of dependence on Rome. Some, such as Fundi (Livy viii. 14; 
cf. ibid. 19), enjoyed a local self-government only limited in the 
matter of jurisdiction; others, such as Anagnia (Livy ix. 43; 
Festus, de verb, significatione, s.v. m " municipium," p. 127, ed. 
MUller), were governed directly from Rome. But they all had 
certain features in common. Their citizens were called upon 
to pay the same dues and perform the same service in the legions 
as full Roman citizens, but were deprived of the chief privileges 
of citizenship, those of voting in the Comitia (jus suffragii), and 
of holding Roman magistracies (Jus konorum). It would also 
appear from Festus (op. cit. s.v. praefectura, p. 233) that juris- 
diction was entrusted in every municipium to praefecti juri 
dicundo sent out from Rome to represent the Praetor Urbanus. 2 
The conferment of municipality can therefore hardly have been 
regarded as other than an imposing of burdens, even in the 
case of those cities which retained control of their own affairs. 
But after the close of the second Punic War, when Rome had 
become the chief power, not only in Italy, but in all the neigh- 
bouring lands round the Mediterranean, we can trace a growing 
tendency among the Italian cities to regard citizenship of this 
great state as a privilege, and to claim complete citizenship as 
a reward of their services in helping to build up the Roman 
power. During the 2nd century B.C. the jus suffragii and jus 
honorum were conferred upon numerous municipia (Livy xxxviii. 
3 6 , 37)» whose citizens were then enrolled in the Roman tribes. 
They can have exercised their public rights but seldom, owing to 
their distance from Rome; but the consulships of C. Marius, 

1 For a contrary view, however, see Marquardt, Rom. Staatsverw. 
i. p. 26, n. 2 (2nd ed., Leipzig, 1881), and authorities there cited.

(Louvain, 1874). 



a municeps of Arpinum (between 107 and 100 B.C.), and the 
strength of the support given to Tiberius Gracchus in the 
assembly by the voters from Italian towns (133 B.C.) show what 
an important influence the members of these municipia could 
occasionally exercise over Roman politics. The cities thus 
privileged, however, though receiving complete Roman citizen- 
ship, were not, as the logic of public law might seem to demand, 
incorporated in Rome, but continued to exist as independent 
urban units; and this anomaly survived in the municipal system 
which was developed, on the basis of these grants of citizen- 
ship, after the Social War. That system recognized the municeps 
as at once a citizen of a self-governing city community, and 
a member of the city of Rome, his dual capacity being illustrated 
by his right of voting both in the election of Roman magistrates 
and in the election of magistrates for his cwn town. 

The result of the Social War which broke out in 91 B.C. 
(see Rome: History) was the establishment of a new uniform 
municipality throughout Italy, and the obliteration of any 
important distinction between the three classes established 
after the Latin War. By the Lex Julia of 00 B.C. and the 
Lex Plautia Papiria of 89 B.C. every town in Italy which made 
application in due form received the complete citizenship. 
The term municipium was no longer confined to a particular 
class of Italian towns but was adopted as a convenient name 
for all urban communities of Roman citizens in Italy. The 
organization of a municipal system, which should regulate the 
governments of all these towns on a uniform basis, and define 
their relation to the Roman government, was probably the work 
of Sulla, who certainly gave great impetus to the foundation 
in the provinces of citizen colonies, which . were the earliest 
municipia outside Italy, and enjoyed the same status as the 
Italian towns. Julius Caesar extended the sphere of the Roman 
municipal system by his enfranchisement of Cisalpine Gaul, 
and the consequent inclusion of all the towns of that region 
in the category of municipia. He seems also to have given 
a more definite organization to the municipia as a whole. But, 
excepting those in Cisalpine Gaul, the municipal system still 
embraced no towns outside Italy other than the citizen colonies. 
Augustus and his successors adopted the practice of granting 
to existing towns in the provinces either the full citizenship, 
or a partial civitas known as the jus Latii. This partial civitas 
does not seem to have been entirely replaced, as in Italy, by 
the grant of full privileges to the communities possessing it, 
and the distinction survived for some time in the provinces 
between coloniae , municipia juris Romani, and municipia juris 
Latini. But the uniform system of administration gradually 
adopted in all three classes rendered the distinction entirely 
unimportant, and the general term municipium is used of ail 
alike. The incorporation of existing towns, hitherto non-Roman, 
in the uniform municipal system of the principate took place 
mainly in the eastern part of the Empire, where Greek civiliza- 
tion had long fostered urban life. In the west city commu- 
nities rapidly sprang up under direct Roman influence. The 
development of towns of the municipal type on the sites where 
legions occupied permanent quarters can be traced in several 
of the western provinces; and it cannot be doubted that this 
development became the rule wherever a body of Roman 
subjects settled down together for any purpose and permanently 
occupied a region. At any rate by the end of the 1st century 
of the principate municipia are numerous in the western as 
well as the eastern half of the Empire, and the towns are every- 
where centres of Roman influence. 

Of the internal life of the municipia very little is known 
before the Empire. For the period after Julius Caesar, however, 
we have two important sources of information. A series of 
municipal laws gives us a detailed knowledge of the constitution 
imposed, with slight variations, on all the municipia; and a 
host of private inscriptions gives particulars of their social life. 

The municipal constitution of the 1st century of the principate 
is based upon the type of government common to Greece and 
Rome from earliest times. , The government of each town 
consists of magistrates, senate and assembly, and is entirely 



8 



MUNICIPIUM 



independent of the Roman government except in certain cases 
of higher civil jurisdiction, which come under the direct cog- 
nisance of the praetor urbanus at Rome. On the other hand, 
each community is bound to perform certain services to the 
Imperial government, such as the contribution of men and 
horses for military service, the maintenance of the imperial 
post through its neighbourhood, and the occasional entertain- 
ment of Roman officials or billeting of soldiers. The citizens 
were of two classes: (i) cives, whether by birth, naturalization 
or emancipation, (2) incolae, who enjoyed a partial citizenship 
based on domicile for a certain period. Both classes were 
liable to civic burdens, but the incolae had none of the privi- 
leges of citizenship except a limited right of voting. The 
citizens were grouped in either tribes or curiae, and accordingly 
the assembly sometimes bore the name of Comitia Tributa, 
sometimes that of Comitia Curiata. The theoretical powers 
of these comitia were extensive both in the election of magis- 
trates and in legislation. But the growing influence of the 
senate over elections on the one hand, and on the other hand the 
increasing reluctance of leading citizens to become candidates 
for office (see below), gradually made popular election a mere 
form. The senatorial recommendation of the necessary number 
of candidates seems to have been merely ratified in the comitia; 
and a Spanish municipal law of the 1st century makes special 
provision for occasions on which an insufficient number of 
candidates are forthcoming. In Italy, however, the reality of 
popular elections seems to have survived to a later date. The 
inscriptions at Pompeii, for instance, give evidence of keenly 
contested elections in the 2nd century. The local senate, or 
curia, always exercised an important influence on municipal 
politics. Its members formed the local nobility, and at an 
early date special privileges were granted by Rome to provincials 
who were senators in their native towns. For the composition, 
powers, and history of the provincial senate see Decxjrio. 
The magistrates were elected annually, and were six in number, 
forming three pairs of colleagues. The highest magistrates 
were the Ilviri (Duoviri) juri dicundo, who had charge, as their 
name implies, of all local jurisdiction, and presided over the 
assembly. Candidates for this office were required to be over 
25 years of age, to have held one of the minor magistracies, 
and to possess all the qualifications required of members of the 
local senate (see Decurio). Next in dignity were the Ilviri 
aediles, who had charge of the roads and public buildings, the 
games and the corn-supply, and exercised police control through- 
out the town. They appear to have been regarded as sub- 
ordinate colleagues {collegae minor es) of the Ilviri juri dicundo, 
and in some towns at least to have had the right to convene 
and preside over the comitia in the absence of the latter. Indeed 
many inscriptions speak of IVviri (Quattuorviri) consisting of 
two IVviri juri dicundo and two IVviri aediles; but in the 
majority of cases the former are regarded as distinct and 
superior magistrates. The two quaestor es, who appear to have 
controlled finance in a large number of municipia, cannot be 
traced in others; and it is probable that in the municipia, as 
at Rome, the quaestorship was locally instituted, as need arose, 
to relieve the supreme magistrates of excessive business. Other 
municipal magistrates frequently referred to in the inscriptions 
are the quinquennales and praefecti. The quinquennales super- 
seded the Ilviri or IVviri juri dicundo every five years, and 
differed from them only in possessing, in addition to their other 
powers, those exercised in Rome before the time of Sulla by the 
censors. Two classes of praefecti are found in the municipalities 
under the Empire, both of which are to be distinguished from 
the officials who bore that name in the municipia before the 
Social War. The first class consists of those praefecti who were 
nominated as temporary delegates by the Ilviri, when through 
illness or compulsory absence they were unable to discharge 
the duties of their office. The second class, referred to in 
inscriptions by the name of praefecti ab decurionibus creati 
lege Petronia, seem to have been appointed by the local senate 
in case of a complete absence of higher magistrates, such as 
would have led in Rome to the appointment of an interrex. 



From a social point of view the municipia of the Roman Empire 
may be treated under three heads: (1) as centres of local self- 
government, (2) as religious centres, (3) as industrial centres. (1) 
The chief feature of the local government of the towns is the wide- 
spread activity of the municipal authorities in improving the general 
conditions of life in the town. In the municipalities, as in Rome, 
provision was made out of the public funds for feeding the poorest 

Cart of the population, and providing a supply of corn which could 
e bought by ordinary citizens at a moderate price. In Pliny's 
time there existed in many towns public schools controlled by the 
municipal authorities, concerning which Pliny remarks that they 
were a source of considerable disturbance in the town at the times 
when it was necessary to appoint teachers. He himself encouraged 
the establishment of another kind of municipal school at Como, 
where the leading townspeople subscribed for the maintenance of 
the school, and the control, including the appointment of teachers, 
remained in the hands of the subscribers. Physicians seem to have 
been maintained in many towns at the public expense. The water- 
supply was also provided out of the municipal budget, and controlled 
by magistrates appointed for the purpose. To enable it to bear the 
expense involved in all these undertakings, the local treasury was 
generally assisted by large benefactions, either in money or in works, 
From individual citizens; but direct taxation for municipal purposes 
was hardly ever resorted to. The treasury was filled out of the 
proceeds of the landed possessions of the community, especially such 
fruitful sources of revenue as mines and quarries, and out of import 
and export duties. It was occasionally subsidized by the emperor 
on occasions of sudden and exceptional calamity. 

2. The chief feature in the religious life 01 the towns was the 
important position they occupied as centres for the cult of the 
emperor. Caesar- worship as an organized cult developed sponta- 
neously in many provincial towns during the reign of Augustus, 
and was fostered by him and his successors as a means of promoting 
in these centres of vigour and prosperity a strong loyalty to Rome 
and the emperor, which was one of the firmest supports of the latter's 
power. The order of Augustales, officials appointed to regulate the 
worship of the emperor in the towns, occupied a position of dignity 
and importance in provincial society. It was composed of the lead- 
ing and the wealthiest men among the lower classes of the popula- 
tion. By the organization of the order on these lines Augustus 
secured the double object of maintaining Caesar-worship in all the 
most vigorous centres of provincial life, and attracting to himself 
and his successors the special devotion of the industrial class which 
had its origin in the municipia of the Roman Empire, and has become 
the greatest political force in modern Europe. 

3. The development of this free industrial class is the chief feature 
of the municipia considered as centres of industry and handicraft. 
The rise to power of the equestrian order in Rome during the last 
century of the Republic had to some extent modified the old Roman 
principle that trade and commerce were beneath the dignity of 
the governing class; but long after the fall of the Republic the aristo- 
cratic notion survived in Rome that industry and handicrafts were 
only fit for slaves. In the provincial towns, however, this idea was 
rapidly disappearing in the early years of the Empire, and even in 
the country towns of Italy the inscriptions give evidence not much 
later of the existence of a large and nourishing free industrial class, 
proud of its occupation, and bound together by a strong esprit de 
corps. Already the members of this class show a strong tendency 
to bind themselves together in gilds (collegia t sodalitates) , and the 
existence of countless associations of the Kind is revealed by the 
inscriptions. The formation of societies for religious and other 
purposes was frequent at Rome from the earliest times in all classes 
of the free population. After the time of Sulla these societies were 
regarded by the government with suspicion, mainly on account of the 
political uses to which they were turned, and various measures were 
passed for their suppression in Rome and Italy. This policy was 
continued by the early emperors and extended to the whole Empire, 
but in spite of opposition the gilds in the provincial towns grew and 
flourished. The ostensible objects of nearly all such collegia of which 
we have any knowledge were twofold, the maintenance of the 
worship of some god, and provision for the performance of proper 
funerary rights for its members. But under cover of these two main 
objects, the only two purposes for which such combinations were 
allowed under the Empire, associations of all kinds grew up. The 
organization of the gilds was based on that of the municipality. 
Each elected its officers and treasurers at an annual meeting, and 
every five years a revision of the list of members was held, correspond- 
ing to that of the senators held quinquennially by the city magis- 
trates. It is doubtful how far these societies served to organize 
and improve particular industries. There is no evidence to show 
that any societies during the first three centuries consisted solely 
of workers at a single craft. But there can be little doubt that the 
later craft gilds were a development, through the industrial gilds 
of the provincial towns, of one of the most ancient featuresof Roman 
life. 

Remarkable concord seems generally to have existed in the 
municipia between the various classes of the population. This 
is accounted for partly by the strong civic feeling which formed 
a bond of unity stronger than most sources of friction, and 



MUNIMENT— MUNKACS 



partly to the general prosperity of the towns, which removed 
any acute discontent. The wealthy citizen seems always to 
have had to bear heavy financial burdens, and to have enjoyed 
in return a dignity and an actual political preponderance which 
made the general character of municipal constitutions distinctly 
timocratic. 

The policy adopted by the early emperors of encouraging, 
within the limits of a uniform system, the independence and 
civic patriotism of the towns, was superseded in the 3rd and 
4th centuries by a deliberate effort to use the towns as instru- 
ments of the imperial government, under the direct control of 
the emperor or his representatives in the provinces. This 
policy was accompanied by a gradual decay of civic feeling and 
municipal enterprise, which showed itself mainly in the un- 
willingness of the townsmen to become candidates for local 
magistracies, or to take up the burdens entailed in membership of 
the municipal senate. Popular control of the local government 
of the towns was ceasing to be a reality as early as the end of 
the 1 st century of the Empire. Two centuries later local 
government was a mere form. And the self-governing com- 
munities of the middle ages were a restoration, rather than a 
development, of the flourishing and independent municipalities 
of the age of Augustus and his immediate successors.

colony of Cameroon, E. and S. by French Congo. The coast- 
line, 75 m. long, stretches from the mouth of the Campo in 
2 10' N. to the mouth of the Muni in i° N., on the north arm 
of Corisco Bay. The small islands of Corisco (q.v.), Elobey 
Grande, Elobey Chico and Bana in Corisco Bay also belong 
to Spain. 

From the estuary of the Campo the coast trends S.S.W. in 
a series of shallow indentations, until at the bold bluff of Cape 
San Juan it turns eastward and forms Corisco Bay. The coast 
plain, from 12 to 25 m. wide, is succeeded by the foot-hills of 
the Crystal Mountains, which traverse the country in a north 
to south direction. These are a table-land, from which rise 
granitic hills 700 to 1200 ft. above the general level, which is 
about 2500 ft. above the sea. The mountainous region, which 
extends inland beyond the Spanish frontier, contains many 
narrow valleys and marshy depressions. The greater part of 
the country forms the basin of the river Benito, which, rising 
in French Congo a little east of the frontier, flows through the 
centre of the Spanish protectorate and enters the sea, after a 
course of 300 m., about midway between the Campo and Muni 
estuaries. The southern bank of the lower course of the Campo 
and the northern bank of the lower course of the Muni, form 
part of the protectorate. The mouths of the Campo and 
Benito are obstructed by sand bars, whereas the channel leading 
to the Mum is some $6 ft. deep and the river itself is more than 
double that depth. It is from this superiority of access that 
the country has been named after the Muni River. The course 
of all the rivers is obstructed by rapids in their descent from 



the table-land to the plain. The greater part of the country 
is covered with dense primeval forest. This forest growth is 
due to the fertility of the soil and the great rainfall, Spanish 
Guinea with the neighbouring Cameroon country possessing 
one of the heaviest rain records of the world. The humidity 
of the climate joined to the excessive heat (the average tempera- 
ture is 78 F.) makes the ch'mate trying. In the eastern parts 
of the protectorate the forest is succeeded by more open country. 
Among the most common trees are oil-palms, rubber- trees, ebony 
and mahogany. The forests are the home of monkeys and of 
innumerable birds and insects, often of gorgeous colouring. 
In the north-east of the country elephants are numerous. 

The inhabitants are Bantu-Negroid, the largest tribe repre- 
sented being the Fang {q.v.), called by the Spaniards Pamues. 
They are immigrants from the Congo basin and have pushed 
before them the tribes, such as the Benga, which now occupy 
the coast-lands. The villages of the Fang are usually placed 
on the top of small hills. They cultivate the yam, banana and 
manioc, and are expert fishers and hunters. The European 
settlements are confined to the coast. There are trading stations 
at the mouths of the Campo, Benito and Mum rivers, at Bata, 
midway between the Campo and Benito, and on Elobey Chico. 
There are cocoa, coffee and other plantations, but the chief 
trade is in natural products, rubber, palm oil and palm kernels, 
and timber. Cotton goods and alcohol are the principal imports. 
Trade is largely in the hands of British and German firms. The 
annual value of the trade in 1003-1906 was about £100,000. 

Spain became possessed of Fernando Po at the end of the 
1 8th century, and Spanish traders somewhat later established 
" factories " on the neighbouring coasts 1 of the mainland, but 
no permanent occupation appears to have been contemplated. 
During the 19th century a number of treaties were concluded 
betv/een Spanish naval officers and the chiefs of the lower 
Guinea coast, and when the partition of Africa was in progress 
Spain laid claim to the territory between the Campo river and 
the Gabun. Germany and France also claimed the territory, 
but in 1885 Germany withdrew in favour of France. After 
protracted negotiations between France and Spain a treaty 
was signed in June 1900 by which France acknowledged Spanish 
sovereignty over the coast region between the Campo and 
Muni rivers and the hinterland as far east as n° 20' E. of 
Greenwich, receiving in return concessions from Spain in the 
Sahara (see Rio de Org), and the right of pre-emption over 
Spain's West African possessions. In 1 901-1902 the eastern 
frontier was delimited, being modified in accordance with 
natural features. The newly acquired territories were placed 
under the superintendence of the governor-general of Fernando 
Po, sub-governors being stationed at Bata, Elobey Chico and 
Corisco.

MUNKACS, a town of Hungary, in the county of Bereg, 
220 m. E.N.E. of Budapest by rail. Pop. (1000), 13,640. It 
is situated on the Latorcza river, and on the outskirts of the 
East Beskides mountains, where the hills touch the plains. Its 
most noteworthy buildings are' the Greek Catholic cathedral 
and the beautiful castle of Count Schonborn. In the vicinity, 
on a steep hill 580 ft. high, stands the old fort of Munkacs, 
which played an important part in Hungarian history, and was 
especially famous for its heroic defence by Helene Zrinyi, wife 
of Emeric Tokoli and mother of Francis Rak6czy II., for three 
years against the Austrians (1685-1688). It was afterwards 
used as a prison. Ypsilanti, the hero of Greek liberty, and 
Kazinczy, the regenerator of Hungarian letters, were confined in 
it. According to tradition, it was near Munkacs that the 
Hungarians, towards the end of the 9th century, entered the 
country. In 1896 in the fort was built one of the " millennial

MUNKACSY, MICHAEL VON (1844-1000), Hungarian painter, 
whose real name was Michael (Miska) Leo Lieb, was the third 
son of Michael Lieb, a collector of salt-tax in Munkacs, Hungary, 
and of Cacilia Rock. He was born in that town on the 20th 
of February 1844. In 1848 his father was arrested at Miskolcz 
for complicity in the Hungarian revolution, and died shortly 
after his release; a little earlier he had also lost his mother, 
and became dependent upon the charity of relations, of whom 
an uncle, Rock, became mainly responsible for his maintenance 
and education. He was apprenticed to a carpenter, Langi, in 
1855, but shortly afterwards made the acquaintance of the 
painters Fischer and Szamossy, whom he accompanied to Arad 
in 1858. From them he received his first real instruction in 
art. He worked mainly at Budapest during 1 863-1 865, and 
at this time first adopted, from patriotic motives, the name by 
which he is always known. In 1865 he visited Vienna, returning 
to Budapest in the following year, and went thence to Munich, 
where he contributed a few drawings to the Fliegende Blatter, 
About the end of 1867 he was working at Diisseldorf, where he 
was much influenced by Ludwig Knaus, and painted (1868- 
1869) his first picture of importance, "The Last Day of a 
Condemned Prisoner," which was exhibited in the Paris Salon 
in 1870, and obtained for him a midaille unique and a very 
considerable reputation. He had already paid a short visit to 
Paris in 1867, but on the 25th of January 1872 he took up his 
permanent abode in that city, and remained there during the 
rest of his working life. Munkacsy's other chief pictures are 
" Milton dictating Puradise Lost to his Daughters " (Paris 
Exhibition, 1878), " Christ before Pilate " (1881), " Golgotha " 
(1883), " The Death of Mozart " (1884), " Arpad, chief of the 
Magyars, taking possession of Hungary," painted for the new 
House of Parliament in Budapest, and exhibited at the Salon 
in 1893, and " Ecce Homo." He had hardly completed the 
latter work when a malady of the brain overtook him, and he 
died on the 30th of April 1000, at Endenich, near Bonn. Just 
before his last illness he had been offered the directorship of 
the Hungarian State Gallery at Budapest. Munkacsy's masterly 
characterization, force and power of dramatic composition 
secured him a great vogue for his works, but it is doubtful if 
his reputation will be maintained at the level it reached during 
his lifetime. " Christ before Pilate " and " Golgotha " were sold 
for £32,000 and £35,000 respectively to an American buyer. 
Munkacsy received the following awards for his work exhibited 
at Paris: Medal, 1870, Medal, 2nd class; Legion of Honour, 
1877; Medal of Honour, 1878; Officer of the Legion, 1878; Grand 
Prix, Exhibition of 1889; Commander of the Legion, 1889.

MtJNNICH, BURKHARD CHRISTOPH, Count (1 683-1 767), 
Russian soldier and statesman, was born at Neuenhuntorf, in 
Oldenburg, in 1683, and at an early age entered the French 
service. Thence he transferred successively to the armies of 
Hesse-Darmstadt and of Saxony, and finally, with the rank of 
general-in-chief and the title of count, he joined the army of 
Peter U. of Russia. In 1732 he became field-marshal and 
president of the council of war. In this post he did good 
service in the re-organization of the Russian army, and founded 
the cadet corps which was destined to supply the future genera- 
tions of officers. In 1 734 he took Danzig, and with 1 736 began 
the Turkish campaigns which made Munnich's reputation as a 
soldier. Working along the shores of the Black Sea from the 
Crimea, he took Ochakov after a celebrated siege in 1737, and 
in 1739 won the battle of Stavutschina, and took Khotin (or 
Choczim), and established himself firmly in Moldavia. Marshal 
Munnich now began to take an active part in political affairs, 
the particular tone of which was given by his rivalry with Biron, 
or Bieren, duke of Courland. But his activity was brought to 
a close by the revolution of 1741; he was arrested on his way 
to the frontier, and condemned to death. Brought out for 



execution, and withdrawn from the scaffold, he was later sent to 
Siberia, where he remained fcr several years, until the accession 
of Peter III. brought about his release in 1762. Catherine II., 
who soon displaced Peter, employed the old field-marshal 
as director-general of the Baltic ports. He died in 1767. Feld- 
marschall Munnich was a fine soldier of the professional type, 
and many future commanders, notably Loudon and Lacy, 
served their apprenticeship at Ochakov and Khotin. As a 
statesman he is regarded as the founder of Russian Philhellenism. 
He had the grade of count of the Holy Roman Empire. The 
Russian 37th Dragoons bear his name. 

He wrote an £bauche pour donner une idie de la forme de V empire 
ie Russie (Leipzig, 1774), and his voluminous diaries have appeared t 
in various publications — Herrmann, Beitrage zur Geschichte des russi- 
schen Reichs (Leipzig. 1843). See Hempel, Leben Munnichs (Bremen. 
1742); Halem, Geschichte des K M. Grafen Munnich (Oldenburg^

Geschichte in Biographien t v. 2). 

MUNRO, SIR HECTOR (1726-1805), British general, son of 
Hugh Munro of Novar, in Cromarty, was born in 1726, and 
entered the army in 1749. He went to Bombay in 176 1, in 
command of the 89th regiment, and in that year effected the 
surrender of Mahe from the French. Later, when in command of 
the Bengal army, he suppressed a mutiny of sepoys at Patna, 
and on the 23rd of October 1764 won the victory of Buxar 
against Shuja-ud-Dowlah, the nawab wazir of Oudh, and Mir 
Kasim, which ranks amongst the most decisive battles ever 
fought in India. Returning home, he became in 1768 M.P. 
for the Inverness Burghs, which he continued to represent in 
parliament for more than thirty years, though a considerable 
portion of this period was spent in India, whither he returned 
in 1778 to take command of the Madras army. In that year 
he took Pondicherry from the French, but in 1780 he was defeated 
by Hyder Ali near Conjeeveram, and forced to fall back on 
St Thomas's Mount. There Sir Eyre Coote took over command 
of the army, and in 1781 won a signal victory against Hyder Ali 
at Porto Novo, where Munro was in command of the right 
division. Negapatam was taken by Munro in November of 
the same year; and in 1782 he returned to England. He died on 
the 27th of December 1805. 

MUNRO, HUGH ANDREW JOHNSTONE (1819-1885), British 
scholar, was born at Elgin on the 19th of October 181 9, He 
was educated at Shrewsbury school, where he was one of 
Kennedy's first pupils, and proceeded to Trinity College, Cam- 
bridge, in 1838. He became scholar of his college in 1840, 
second classic and first chancellor's medallist in 1842, and 
fellow of his college in 1843. He became classical lecturer at 
Trinity College, and in 1869 was elected to the newly-founded 
chair of Latin at Cambridge, but resigned it in 1872. The 
great work on which his reputation is mainly based is his 
edition of Lucretius, the fruit of the labour of many years (text 
only, 1 vol., i860; text, commentary and translation, 2 vols., 
1864). As a textual critic his knowledge was profound and 
his judgment unrivalled; and he made close archaeological 
studies by frequent travels in Italy and Greece. In 1867 he 
published an improved text of Aetna with commentary, and 
in the following year a text of Horace with critical introduction, 
illustrated by specimens of ancient gems selected by C. W. King. 
His knowledge and taste are nowhere better shown than in his 
Criticisms and Elucidations of Catullus (1878). He was a master 
of the art of Greek and Latin verse composition. His contri- 
butions to the famous volume of Shrewsbury verse, Sabrinae 
corolla, are among the most remarkable of a remarkable collec- 
tion. His Translations into Latin and Greek Verse were privately 
printed in 1884. Like his translations into English, they are 
characterized by minute fidelity to the original, but never cease 
to be idiomatic. He died at Rome on the 30th of March 1885.

Lucretius in " Bonn's Classical Library " (1008). 

MUNRO, Monro or Monroe, ROBERT (d. c. 1680), Scots 
general, was a member of a well-known family in Ross-shire, 
the Munroes of Foulis. With several of his kinsmen he served 
in the continental wars under Gustavus Adolphus; and he

appears to have returned to Scotland about 1638, and to have 
taken some part in the early incidents of the Scottish rebellion 
against Charles I. In 1642 he went to Ireland, nominally as 
second in command under Alexander Leslie, but in fact in chief 
command of the Scottish contingent against the Catholic rebels. 
After taking and plundering Newry in April 1642, and ineffec- 
tually attempting to subdue Sir Phelim O'Neill, Munro succeeded 
in taking prisoner the earl of Antrim at Dunluce. The arrival 
of Owen Roe O'Neill in Ireland strengthened the cause of the 
rebels (see O'Neill), and Munro, who was poorly supplied with 
provisions and war materials, showed little activity. Moreover, 
the civil war in England was now creating confusion among parties 
in Ireland, and the king was anxious to come to terms with 
the Catholic rebels, and to enlist them on his own behalf against 
the parliament. The duke of Ormonde, Charles's lieutenant- 
general in Ireland, acting on the king's orders, signed a cessation 
of hostilities with the Catholics on the 15th of September 1643, 
and exerted himself to despatch aid to Charles in England. 
Munro in Ulster, holding his commission from the Scottish 
parliament, did not recognize the armistice, and his troops 
accepted the solemn league and covenant, in which they were 
joined by many English soldiers who left Ormonde to join him. 
In April 1644 the English parliament entrusted Munro with the 
command of all the forces in Ulster, both English and Scots. 
He thereupon seized Belfast, made a raid into the Pale, and 
unsuccessfully attempted to gain possession of Dundalk and 
Drogheda. His force was weakened by the necessity for sending 
troops to Scotland to withstand Montrose; while Owen Roe 
O'Neill was strengthened by receiving supplies from Spain and 
the pope. On the 5th of June 1646 was fought the battle of 
Benburb, on the Blackwater, where O'Neill routed Munro, but 
suffered him to withdraw in safety to Carrickfergus. In 1647 
Ormonde was compelled to come to terms with the English 
parliament, who sent commissioners to Dublin in June of that 
year. The Scots under Munro refused to surrender Carrick- 
fergus and Belfast when ordered by the parliament to return 
to Scotland, and Munro was superseded by the appointment of 
Monk to the chief command in Ireland. In September 1648 
Carrickfergus was delivered over to Monk by treachery, and 
Munro was taken prisoner. He was committed to the Tower 
of London, where he remained a prisoner for five" years. In 
1654 he was permitted by Cromwell to reside in Ireland, where 
he had estates in right of his wife, who was the widow of Viscount 
Montgomery of Ardes. Munro continued to live quietly near 
Comber, Co. Down, for many years, and probably died there 
about 1680. He was in part the original of Dugald Dalgetty in 
Sir Walter Scott's Legend of Montrose.

MUNRO, SIR THOMAS (1761-1827), Anglo-Indian soldier and 
statesman, was born at Glasgow on the 27th of May 1761, the 
son of a merchant. Educated at Glasgow University, he was 
at first intended to enter his father's business, but in 17S9 he 
was appointed to an infantry cadetship in Madras. He served 
with his regiment during the hard-fought war against Hyder 
Ali (1780-83), and again in the first campaign against Tippoo 
(1790-92). He was then chosen as one of four military 
officers to administer the Baramahal, part of the territory 
acquired from Tippoo, where he remained for seven years, 
learning the principles of revenue survey and assessment which 
he afterwards applied throughout the presidency of Madras. 
After the final downfall of Tippoo in 1799, he spent a short time 
restoring order in Kanara; and then for another seven years 
(1 800-1 807) he was placed in charge of the northern districts 
" ceded " by the nizam of Hyderabad, where he introduced 
the ryotwari system of land revenue. After a long furlough 
in England, during which he gave valuable evidence upon 



matters connected with the renewal of the company's charter, 
he returned to Madras in 1814 with special instructions to reform 
the judicial and police systems. On the outbreak cf the Pindari 
War in 181 7, he was appointed as brigadier-general to command 
the reserve division formed to reduce the southern territories of 
the Peshwa. Of his signal services on this occasion Canning 
said in the House of Commons: " He went into the field with 
not more than five or six hundred men, of whom a very small pro- 
portion were Europeans. . . . Nine forts were surrendered to him 
or taken by assault on his way; and at the end of a silent and 
scarcely observed progress he emerged . . . leaving everything 
secure and tranquil behind him." In 1820 he was appointed 
governor of Madras, where he founded the systems of revenue 
assessment and general administration which substantially 
remain to the present day. His official minutes, published by 
Sir A. Arbuthnot, form a manual of experience and advice for 
the modern civilian. He died of cholera on the 6th of July 1827, 
while on tour in the " ceded " districts, where his name is preserved 
by more than one memorial. An equestrian statue of him, by 
Chantrey, stands in Madras city.

MUNSHI, or Moonshi, the Urdu name of a writer or secretary, 
used in India of the native language teachers or secretaries 
employed by Europeans. 

MUNSTER, GEORG, Count zu (1 776-1844), German palae- 
ontologist, was born on the 17th of February 1776. He tormed 
a famous collection of fossils, which was ultimately secured by the 
Bavarian state, and formed the nucleus of the palaeontological 
museum at Munich. Count Minister assisted Goldfuss in his 
great work Petrefacta Germaniae. He died at Bayreuth on the 
23rd of December 1844. 

MUNSTER, SEBASTIAN (1480-1552), German geographer, 
mathematician and Hebraist, was born at Ingelheim in the 
Palatinate. After studying at Heidelberg and Tubingen, he 
entered the Franciscan order, but abandoned it for Luther- 
anism about 1529. Shortly afterwards he was appointed court 
preacher at Heidelberg, where he also lectured in Hebrew and 
Old Testament exegesis. From 1536 he taught at Basel, where 
he published his Cosmograpkia universalis in 1544, and where 
he died of the plague on the 23rd of May 1552. A disciple 
of Elias Levita, he was the first German to edit the Hebrew 
Bible (2 vols., fol., Basel, 1 534*1535); this edition was accom- 
panied by a new Latin translation and a large number of anno- 
tations. He published more than one Hebrew grammar, and 
was the first to prepare a Grammatica chaldaica (Basel, 1527). 
His lexicographical labours included a Dictionarium chaldaicum 
(1527), and a Dictionarium Irilingue, of Latin, Greek and 
Hebrew (1530). But his most important work was his Cosmo- 
grapkia, which also appeared in German as a Beschreibung alter 
LUnder, the first detailed, scientific and popular description of 
the world in Miinster's native language, as well as a supreme 
effort of geographical study and literature in the Reformation 
period. In this Miinster was assisted by more than one hundred 
and twenty collaborators. 

The most valued edition of the Cosmographia or Beschreibung 
is that of 1550, especially prized for its portraits and its city and 
costume pictures. Besides the works mentioned above we may 
notice Minister's Germaniae descriptio of 1530, his Novus orbis of 
1532, his Mat>pa Europae of 1536, his Rhaetia of 1538, his editions 
of Solinus, Mela and Ptolemy in 1 538-1 540 and among non- 
geographical treatises his Horologiographia, 1531, on dialling (see 
Dial), his Organum uranicum of 1536 on the planetary motions, and 
his Rudimenta mathematica of 1551. His published maps numbered 
142.

MONSTER, a town of Germany, in the district of Upper 
Alsace, 16 m. from Colmar by rail, and at the foot of the Vosges 
Mountains. Pop. (1905), 6078. Its principal industries are 
spinning, weaving and bleaching. The town owes its origin 
to a Benedictine abbey, which was founded in the 7th century, 
and at one time it was a free city of the empire. In its

for its cheese.

MUNSTER, a town of Germany, capital of the Prussian pro- 
vince of Westphalia, and formerly the capital of an important 
bishopric. It lies in a sandy plain on the Dortmund-Ems canal, 
at the junction of several railways, 107 m. S.W. of Bremen 
on the line to Cologne. Pop. (1885), 44i°6o; (io°5) 81,468. 
The town preserves its medieval character, especially in the 
" Prinzipal-Markt " and other squares, with their lofty gabled 
houses and arcades. The fortifications were dismantled during 
the 1 8th century, their place being taken by gardens and prome- 
nades. Of the many churches of Munster the most important 
is the cathedral, one of the most striking in Germany, although 
disfigured by modern decorations. It was rebuilt in the 13th 
and 14th centuries, and exhibits a combination of Romanesque 
and Gothic forms; its chapter-house is specially fine. The 
beautiful Gothic church of St Lambert (14th century) was 
largely rebuilt after 1868; on its tower, which is 312 ft. in height, 
hang three iron cages in which the bodies of John of Leiden 
and two of his followers were exposed in 1536. The church of 
St Ludger, erected in the Romanesque style about 11 70, was 
extended in the Gothic style about 200 years later; it has a 
tower with a picturesque lantern. The church of St Maurice, 
founded about 1070, was rebuilt during the 19th century, and 
the Gothic church of Our Lady dates from the 14th century. 
Other noteworthy buildings are the town-hall, a fine Gothic 
building of the 14th century, and the Stadtkeller, which contains 
a collection of early German paintings. The room in the town- 
hall called the Friedens Saal, in which the peace of Westphalia 
was signed in October 1648, contains portraits of many ambas- 
sadors and princes who were present at the ceremony. The 
Schloss, built in 1767, was formerly the residence of bishops of 
Munster. The private houses, many of which were the winter 
residences of the nobility of Westphalia, are admirable examples 
of German domestic architecture in the 16th, 17th and 18th 
centuries. The university of Munster, founded after the Seven 
Years' War and closed at the beginning of the 19th century, 
was reopened as an academy in 181 8, and again attained «the 
rank of a university in 1902. It possesses faculties of theology, 
philosophy and law. In connexion with it are botanical and 
zoological gardens, several scientific collections, and a library of 
120,000 volumes. Munster is the seat of a Roman Catholic 
bishop and of- the administrative and judicial authorities of 
Westphalia, and is the headquarters of an army corps. The 
Westphalian society of antiquaries and several other learned 
bodies also have their headquarters here. Industries include 
weaving, dyeing, brewing and printing, and the manufacture of 
furniture and machines. There is a brisk trade in cattle, grain 
and other products of the neighbourhood. 

History. — Munster is first mentioned about the year 800, 
when Charlemagne made it the residence of Ludger, the newly- 
appointed bishop of the Saxons. Owing to its disfance from 
any available river or important highway, the growth of the 
settlement round the tnonasterium was slow, and it was not 
until after 1186 that it received a charter, the name Munster 
having supplanted the original name of Mimegardevoord about 
a century earlier. During the 13th and 14th centuries the 
town was one of the most prominent members of the Hanseatic 
League. At the time of the Reformation the citizens were 
inclined to adopt the Protestant doctrines, but the excesses 
of the Anabaptists led in 1535 to the armed intervention of 
the bishop and to the forcible suppression of all divergence 
from the older faith. The Thirty Years' War, during which 
Munster suffered much from the Protestant armies, was ter- 
minated by the peace of Westphalia, sometimes called the peace 
of Munster, because it was signed here on the 24th of October 
1648. The authority of the bishops, who seldom resided at 
Munster, was usually somewhat limited, but in 1661 Bishop 



Christoph Bernhard von Galen took the place by force, built a 
citadel, and deprived the citizens of many of their privileges. 
During the Seven Years' War Munster was occupied both 
by the French and by their foes. Towards the close of the 
18th century the town was recognized as one of the intellectual 
centres of Germany. 

The bishopric of Munster embraced an area of about 2500 sq. m. 
and contained about 35°,ooo inhabitants. Its bishops, who 
resided generally at Ahaus, were princes of the empire. In 
the 17th century Bishop Galen, with his army of 20,000 men, 
was so powerful that his alliance was sought by Charles II. of 
England and other European sovereigns. The bishopric was 
secularized and its lands annexed to Prussia in 1803.

MUNSTER, a province of Ireland occupying the S.W. part of 
the island. It includes the counties Clare, Tipperary, Limerick, 
Kerry, Cork and Waterford (q.v. for topography, &c). After 
the occupation of Ireland by the Milesians, Munster (Mttmha) 
became nominally a provincial kingdom; but as the territory was 
divided between two families there was constant friction and 
it was not until 237 that Olio! Olum established himself as king 
over the whole. In 248 he divided his kingdom between his 
two sons, giving Desmond (q.v., Des-Mumha) to Eoghan and 
Thomond (Titadk-Mumha) or north Munster to Cormac. He 
also stipulated that the rank of king of Munster should belong 
in turn to their descendants. In this way the kingship of 
Munster survived until 1194; but there were kings of Desmond 
and Thomond down to the 16th century. Munster was originally 
of the same extent as the present province, excepting that it 
included the district of Ely, which belonged to the O'Carrols 
and formed a part of the present King's County. During the 
1 6th century, however, Thomond was for a time included in 
Connaught, being declared a county under the name of Clare 
(q.v.) by Sir Henry Sidney. Part of Munster had been included 
in the system of shiring generally attributed to King John. In 
1570 a provincial presidency of Munster (as of Connaught) 
was established by Sidney, Sir John Perrot being the first 
president, and lasted until 1672. Under Perrot a practically 
new shiring was carried out. 

MUNSTER AM STEIN, a watering-place of Germany, in the 
Prussian Rhine province, on the Nahe, 25 m. S. of Kreuznach, 
on the railway from Bingerbriick to Strassburg. Pop. (1905), 
915. Above the village are the ruins of the castle of Rhein- 
grafenstein (12th century), formerly a seat of the count palatine 
of the Rhine, which was destroyed by the French in 1689, and 
those of the castle of Ebemburg, the ancestral seat of the lords 
of Sickingen, and the birthplace of Franz von Sickingen, the 
famous landsknecht captain and protector of Ulrich von Hutten, 
to whom a monument was erected on the slope near the ruins 
in 1889. The spa (saline and carbonate springs), specific in 
cases of feminine disorders, is visited by about 5000 patients 
annually.

MUNSTERBERG, HUGO (1863- ), German-American psycho- 
physiologist, was born at Danzig. Having been extraordinary 
professor at Freiburg-im-Breisgau, he became in 1892 pro- 
fessor of psychology at Harvard University. Among his more 
important works are Beitrdge zur experimenlellen Psychologie 
(4 vols., Freiburg, 1889-1892); Psychology and Life (New 
York, 1899); Grundziige der Psychologie (Leipzig, 1900); 
American Traits from the Point of View of a German (Boston, 
1901); Die Amerikaner (several ed.; Eng. trans. 1904); Science 
and Idealism (New'York, 1906); Philosophie der Werte (Leipzig, 
1908); Aus Dentsch-Amerika (Berlin, 1908); Psychology and 
Crime (New York, 1908). He has been prominently identified 
with the modern developments of experimental psychology

MUNSTERBERG^ a town of Germany, in the Prussian pro- 
vince of Silesia, on the Ohlau, 36 m. by rail S. of Breslau. Pop. 
(1905), 8475. It is partly surrounded by medieval walls. It 
has manufactures of drain-pipes and fireproof bricks; there are 
also sulphur springs. Miinsterberg was formerly the capital 
of the principality of the same name, which existed from the 
14th century down to i79r, when it was purchased by the 
Prussian crown. Near the town is the former Cistercian abbey 
of Heinrichau. 

MUNTANER, RAMON '(1 265-1336?), Catalan historian, was 
born at Peralada (Catalonia) in 1265. The chief events of his 
career are recorded in his chronicle. He accompanied Roger dc 
Flor to Sicily in 1300, was present at the siege of Messina, 
served in the expedition of the Almogavares against Asia Minor, 
and became the first governor of Gallipoli. Later he was 
appointed governor of Jerba or Zerbi, an island in the Gulf of 
Gabes, and finally entered the service of the infante of Majorca. 
On the 15th of May 1325 (some editions give the year 1335) he 
began his Chronica , descripcio dels jets, e kozanas del inclyt 
rey Don Iaume Primer, in obedience, as he says, to the express 
command of God who appeared to him in a vision. Muntaner's 
book, which was first printed at Valencia in 1558, is the chief 
authority for the events of his period, and his narrative, though 
occasionally prolix, uncritical and egotistical, is faithful and 
vivid. He is said to have died in 1336. 

His chronicle is most accessible in the edition published by Karl 
Lanz at Stuttgart in 1844. 

MUNTJAC, the Indian name of a small deer typifying the 
genus Cervicitis, all the members of which are indigenous to the 
southern and eastern parts of Asia and the adjacent islands, 
and are separated by marked characters from all their allies. 
For the distinctive features of the genus see Deer. As regards 
general characteristics, all muntjacs are small compared with 
the majority of deer, and have long bodies and rather short 
limbs and neck. The antlers of the bucks are small and simple; 




The Indian Muntjac (Cervulus muntjac). 
the main stem or beam, after giving off a short brow-tine, in- 
clining backwards and upwards, being unbranched and pointed, 
and when fully developed curving inwards and somewhat down- 
wards at the tip. These small antlers are v supported upon 
pedicles, or processes of the frontal bones, longer than in any 
other deer, the front edges of these being continued downwards 
as strong ridges passing along the sides of the face above the 
eyes. From this feature the name rib-faced deer has been 
suggested for the muntjac. The upper canine teeth of the males 
are large and sharp, projecting outside the mouth as tusks, and 
loosely implanted in their sockets. In the females they are 
much smaller. 



Muntjacs are solitary animals, even two being rarely seen 
together. They are fond of hilly ground covered with forests, 
in the dense thickets of which they pass most of their time, only 
coming to the skirts of the woods at morning and evening to 
graze. They carry the head and neck low and the hind-quarters 
high, their action in running being peculiar and not elegant, 
somewhat resembling the pace of a sheep. Though with no 
power of sustained speed or extensive leaping, they are remark- 
able for flexibility of body and facility of creeping through 
tangled underwood. A popular name with Indian sportsmen 
is " barking deer," on account of the alarm-cry — a kind of short 
shrill bark, like that of a fox, but louder. When attacked by 
dogs, the males use their sharp canine teeth, which inflict deep 
and even dangerous wounds. 

In" the Indian muntjac the height of the buck is from 20 to 22 in.; 
allied types, some of which have received distinct names, occur in 
Burma and the Malay Peninsula and Islands. Among these, the 
Burmese C. muntjac grandicornis is noteworthy on account of its 
large antlers. The Tibetan muntjac (C. lachrymans), from Moupin 
in eastern Tibet and Hangchow in China, is somewhat smaller than 
the Indian animal, with a bright reddish-brown coat. The smallest 
member of the genus (C. reevesi) occurs in southern China and has a 
reddish-chestnut coat, speckled with yellowish grey and a black 
band down the nape. The Tenasserim muntjac (C.jeae), about the 
size of the Indian species, is closely allied to the hairy-fronted 
muntjac (C crinifrons) of eastern China, but lacks the tuft of hair 
on the forehead. The last-mentioned species, by its frontal tuft, 
small rounded ears, general brown coloration, and minute antlers, 
connects the typical muntjacs with the small tufted deer or tufted 
muntjacs of the genus Elaphodus of eastern China and Tibet. These 
last have coarse bristly hair of a purplish-brown colour with light 
markings, very large head-tufts, almost concealing the minute 
antlers, of which the pedicles do not extend as ribs down the face. 
They include E. cephalophus of Tibet, E. mickianus of Ningpo, and 
E. ichangensis of the mountains of Ichang. (R. L.*) 

MUNZER, THOMAS (c. 1480-1525), German religious enthu- 
siast, was born at Stolberg in the Harz near the end of the 15th 
century, and educated at Leipzig and Frankfort, graduating in 
theology. He held preaching appointments in various places, 
but his restless nature prevented him from remaining in one 
position for any length of time. In 1520 he became a preacher 
at the church of St Mary, Zwickau, and his rude eloquence, 
together with his attacks on the monks, soon raised him to 
influence. Aided by Nicholas Storch, he formed a society the 
principles of which were akin to those of the Taborites, and 
claimed that he was under the direct influence of the Holy 
Spirit. His zeal for the purification of the Church by casting 
out all unbelievers brought him into conflict with the governing 
body of the town, and he was compelled to leave Zwickau. He 
then went to Prague, where his preaching won numerous ad- 
herents, but his violent language brought about his expulsion 
from this city also. At Easter 1523 Miinzcr came to Allstedt, 
and was soon appointed preacher at the church of St John, 
where he made extensive alterations in the services. His 
violence, however, aroused the hostility of Luther, in retaliation 
for which Miinzer denounced the Wittenberg teaching. His 
preaching soon produced an uproar in Allstedt, and after holding 
his own for some time he left the town and went to Miihlhauscn, 
where Heinrich Pfeiffer was already preaching doctrines similar 
to his own. The union of Miinzer and Pfeiffer caused a disturb- 
ance in this city and both were expelled. Miinzer went to 
Nuremberg, where he issued a writing against Luther, who had 
been mainly instrumental in bringing about his expulsion from 
Saxony. About this time his teaching became still more violent. 
He denounced established governments, and advocated common 
ownership of the means of life. After a tour in south Germany 
he returned to Miihlhausen, overthrew the governing body of 
the city, and established a communistic theocracy. The 
Peasants' War had already broken out in various parts of 
Germany; and as the peasantry around Miihlhausen were imbued 
with Munzer's teaching, he collected a large body of men to 
plunder the surrounding country. He established his camp at 
Frankenhausen ; but on the 15th of May 1525 the peasants were 
dispersed by Philip, landgrave of Hesse, who captured Miinzer 
and executed him on the 27th at Miihlhausen. Before his

MUNZINGER, WERNER (1832-1875), Swiss linguist and 
traveller, was born at Olten in Switzerland, on the 21st of April 
1832. After studying natural science, Oriental languages and 
history, at Bern, Munich and Paris, he .went to Egypt in 1852 
and spent a year in Cairo perfecting himself in Arabic. Entering 
a French mercantile house, he went as leader of a trading expe- 
dition to various parts of the Red Sea, fixing his quarters at 
Massawa, where he acted as French consul. In 1855 he removed 
to Keren, the chief town of the Bogos, in the north of Abyssinia, 
which country he explored during the next six years. In 1861 
he joined the expedition under T. von Heuglin to Central Africa, 
but separated from him in November in northern Abyssinia, 
proceeding along the Gash and Athara to Khartum. Thence, 
having meantime succeeded Heuglin as leader of the expedition, 
he travelled in 1862 to Kordofan, failing, however, in his attempt 
to reach Darfur and Wadai. After a short stay in Europe in 
1863, Munzinger returned to the north and north-east border- 
lands of Abyssinia, and in 1865, the year of the annexation of 
Massawa by Egypt, was appointed British consul at that town. 
He rendered valuable aid to the Abyssinian expedition of 
1867-68, among other things exploring the almost unknown 
Afar country. In acknowledgment of his services he received the 
C.B. In 1868 he was appointed French consul at Massawa, and 
in 1 87 1 was named by the khedive Ismail governor of that town 
with the title of bey. In 1870, with Captain S. B. Miles, Mun- 
zinger visited southern Arabia. As governor of Massawa he 
annexed to Egypt the Bogos and Hamasen provinces of northern 
Abyssinia, and in 1872 was made pasha and governor-general 
of the eastern Sudan. It is believed that it was on his advice 
that Ismail sanctioned the Ahyssinian enterprise, but on the war 
assuming larger proportions in 1875 the command of the Egyptian 
troops in northern Abyssinia was taken from Munzinger, who was 
selected to command a small expedition intended to open up 
communication with Menelek, king of Shoa, then at enmity with 
the negus Johannes (King John) and a potential ally of Egypt. 
Leaving Tajura Bay on the 27th of October 1875 Munzinger 
started for Ankober with a force of 350 men, being accompanied 
by an envoy from Menelek. The desert country to be traversed 
was in the hands of hostile tribes, and on reaching Lake Aussa 
the expedition was attacked during the night by Gallas — Mun- 
zinger, with his wife and nearly all his companions, being 
killed. 

Munzinger's contributions to the knowledge of the country, 
people and languages of north-eastern Africa are of solid value.

MURAD, or Amurath, the name of five Ottoman sultans. 

Murad I., surnamed Khudavendighiar (1310-1389), was the 
son of Orkhan and the Greek princess Nilofer, and succeeded 
his father in 1359. He was the first Turkish monarch to obtain 
a definite footing in Europe, and his main object throughout 
his career was to extend the European dominions of Turkey. 
The revolts of the prince of Caramania interfered with the 
realization of this plan, and trouble was caused from this quarter 
more than once during his reign until the decisive battle of Konia 
{1387), when the power of the prince of Caramania was broken. 



The state of Europe facilitated Murad's projects: civil war and 
anarchy prevailed in most of the countries of Central Europe, 
where the feudal system was at its last gasp, and the small 
Balkan states were divided by mutual jealousies. The capture 
of Adrianople, followed by other conquests, brought about a 
coalition under the king of Hungary against Murad, but his able 
lieutenant Lalashahin, the first beylerbey of Rumelia, defeated 
the allies at the battle of the Maritsa in 1363. In 1366 the 
king of Servia was defeated at Samakov and forced to pay 
tribute. Kustendil, Philippopolis and Nish fell into the hands, 
of the Turks; a renewal of the war in 1381 led to the capture 
of Sofia two years later. Europe was now aroused; Lazar, 
king of Servia, formed an alliance with the Albanians, the 
Hungarians and the Moldavians against the Turks. Murad 
hastened back to Europe and met his enemies on the field of 
Kossovo (1389). Victory finally inclined to the side of the 
Turks. When the rout of the Christians was complete, a Servian 
named Milosh Kabilovich penetrated to Murad 's tent on pretence 
of communicating an important secret to the sultan, and stabbed 
the conqueror. Murad was of independent character and 
remarkable intelligence. He was fond of pleasure and luxury, 
cruel and cunning. Long relegated to the command of a distant 
province in Asia, while his brother Suleiman occupied an enviable 
post in Europe, he hecame revengeful; thus he exercised great 
cruelty in the repression of the rebellion of his son Prince Sauji, 
the first instance of a sultan's son taking arms against his father. 
Murad transferred the Ottoman capital from Brusa to Adrianople, 
where he built a palace and added many embellishments to 
the town. The development of the feudal system of timers and 
ziamets and its extension to Europe was largely his work. 

Murad II. (1403-1451) succeeded his father Mahommed I. 
in 1421. The attempt of his uncle Prince Mustafa to usurp 
the throne, supported as it was by the Greeks, gave trouble at 
the outset of his reign, and led to the unsuccessful siege of 
Constantinople in 1422. Murad maintained a long struggle 
against the Bosnians and Hungarians, in the course cf which 
Turkey sustained many severe reverses through the valour 0/ 
Janos Hunyadi. Accordingly in 1444 he concluded a treaty at 
Szegedin for ten years, by which he renounced all claim to Servia 
and recognized George Brancovich as its king. Shortly after 
this, being deeply affected by the death of his eldest son Prince 
Ala-ud-din, he abdicated in favour of Mahommed, his second 
son, then fourteen years of age. But the treacherous attack, in 
violation of treaty, by the Christian powers, imposing too hard 
a task on the inexperienced young sovereign, Murad returned 
from his retirement at Magnesia, crushed his faithless enemies 
at the battle of Varna (Novemebr 10, 1444), and again withdrew 
to Magnesia. A revolt of the janissaries induced him to return 
to power, and he spent the remaining six years of his life in 
warfare in Europe, defeating Hunyadi at Kossovo (October 
17-19, 1448). He died at Adrianople in 145 1, and was buried 
at Brusa. By some considered as a fanatical devotee, and hy 
others as given up to mysticism, he is generally described as 
kind and gentle in disposition, and devoted to the interests of 
his country. 

Murad III. (1546-1595), was the eldest son of Selim II., 
and succeeded his father in 1574. His accession marks the 
definite beginning of the decline of the Ottoman power, which 
had only heen maintained under Selim II. hy the genius of the 
all-powerful grand vizier Mahommed Sokolli. For, though 
Sokolli remained in office until his assassination in October 1578, 
his authority was undermined by the harem influences, which 
with Murad III. were supreme. Of these the most powerful 
was that of the sultan's chief wife, named Safie (the pure), a 
beautiful Venetian of the noble family of Baffo, whose father 
had been governor of Corfu, and who had been captured as a 
child by Turkish corsairs and sold into the harem. This lady, 
in spite of the sultan's sensuality and of the effort's, temporarily 
successful, to supplant her in his favour, retained her ascendancy 
over him to the last. Murad had none of the qualities of a 
ruler. He was good-natured, though cruel enough on occasion: 
his accession had been marked by the murder, according to the 



MURAENA 



*5 



<ustom then established, of his five brothers. His will-power 
had early been undermined by the opium habit, and was further 
weakened by the sensual excesses that ultimately killed him. 
Nor had he any taste for rule; his days were spent in the society 
of musicians, buffoons and poets, and he himself dabbled in 
verse-making of a mystic tendency. 

His one attempt at reform, the order forbidding the sale of 
intoxicants so as to stop the growing intemperance of the 
janissaries, broke down on the opposition of the soldiery. He 
was the first sultan to share personally in the proceeds of the 
corruption which was undermining the state, realizing especially 
large sums by the sale of offices. This corruption was fatally 
apparent in the army, the feudal basis of which was sapped by 
the confiscation of fiefs for the benefit of nominees of favourites 
of the harem, and by the intrusion, through the same influences 
of foreigners and rayahs into the corps of janissaries, of which 
the discipline became more and more relaxed and the temper 
increasingly turbulent. In view of this general demoralization 
not even the victorious outcome of the campaigns in Georgia, 
the Crimea, Daghestan, Yemen and Persia (1578-1590) could 
prevent the decay of the Ottoman power; indeed, by weakening 
the Mussulman states, they hastened the process, since they 
facilitated the advance of Russia to the Black Sea and the 
Caspian. 

Murad, who had welcomed the Persian War as a good oppor- 
tunity for ridding himself of the presence of the janissaries, 
whom he dreaded, had soon cause to fear their triumphant 
return. Incensed by the debasing of the coinage, which robbed 
them of part of their pay, they invaded the Divan clamouring 
for the heads of the sultan's favourite, the beylerbey of Rumelia, 
and of the defterdar (finance minister), which were thrown to 
them (April 3, 1589). This was the first time that the janissaries 
had invaded the palace: a precedent to be too often followed. 
The outbreak of another European war in 1592 gave the sultan 
an opportunity of ridding himself of their presence. Murad died 
in 1595, leaving to his successor a legacy of war and anarchy. 

It was under Murad III. that England's relations with the 
Porte began. Negotiations were opened in 1579 with Queen 
Elizabeth through certain British merchants; in 1580 the first 
Capitulations with England were signed ; in 1 583 William 
Harebone, the first British ambassador to the Porte, arrived 
at Constantinople, and in 1593 commercial Capitulations were 
signed with England granting the same privileges as those 
enjoyed by the French. (See Capitulations.) 

Murad IV. (1611-1640) was the son of Sultan Ahmed I., 
and succeeded his uncle Mustafa I. in 1623. For the first nine 
years of his reign his youth prevented him from taking more than 
an observer's part in affairs. But the lessons thus learnt were 
sufficiently striking to mould his whole character and policy. 
The minority of the sultan gave full pky to the anarchic elements 
in the state; the soldiery, spahis and janissaries, conscious of 
•their power and reckless through impunity, rose in revolt 
whenever the whim seized them, demanding privileges and the 
heads of those who displeased them, not sparing even the 
sultan's favourites. In 1631 the spahis of Asia Minor rose in 
revolt, in protest ' against the deposition of the grand vizier 
Khosrev: their representatives crowded to Constantinople, 
stoned the new grand vizier, Hafiz, in the court of the palace, 
and pursued the sultan himself into the inner apartments, 
clamouring for seventeen heads of his advisers and favourites, 
on penalty of his own deposition. Hafiz was surrendered, a 
voluntary martyr; other ministers were deposed; Mustafa 
Pasha, aga of the janissaries, was saved by his own troops. 
But Murad was now beginning to assert himself. Khosrev was 
executed in Asia Minor by his orders; a plot of the spahis to 
depose him was frustrated by the loyalty of Koes Mahommed, 
aga of the janissaries, and of the spahi Rum Mahommed 
(Mahommed the Greek); and on the 29th of May 1632, by a 
successful personal appeal to the loyalty of the janissaries, 
Murad crushed the rebels, whom he surrounded in the Hippo- 
drome. At the age of twenty he found himself possessed of 
effective autocratic power. 



His severity has remained legendary. Death was the penalty 
for the least offence, and no past services — as Koes Mahommed 
was to find to his cost — were admitted in extenuation. The use 
of tobacco, coffee, opium and wine were forbidden on pain 
of death; eighteen persons are said to have been put to death in 
a single day for infringing this rule. During his whole reign, 
indeed, supposed offenders against the sultan's authority were 
done to death, singly or in thousands. The tale of his victims is 
said to have exceeded 100,000. 

But if he was the most cruel, Murad was also one of the most 
manly, of the later sultans. He was of gigantic strength, which 
he maintained by constant physical exercises. He was also 
fond of hunting, and for this reason usually lived at Adrianople. 
He broke through the alleged tradition, bequeathed by Suleiman 
the Magnificent to his successors, that the sultan should not 
command the troops in person, and took command in the 
Persian war which led to the capture of Bagdad (1638) and the 
conclusion of an honourable peace (May 7, 1639). Early in 1640 
he died, barely twenty-nine years of age. The cause of his death 
was acute gout brought on by excessive drinking. In spite of 
his drunkenness, however, Murad was a bigoted Sunni, and the 
main cause of his campaign against Persia was his desire to 
extirpate the Shia heresy. In the intervals of his campaignings 
and cruelties the sultan would amuse his entourage by exhibit- 
ing feats of strength, or compose verses, some of which were 
published under the pseudonym of Muradi. 

See, for details of the lives of the above, J. von Hammer-PurgstaU, 
Geschichte des osmanischen Retches (Pest, 1840), where further 
authorities are cited. 

Murad V. (1840-1904), eldest son of Sultan Abd-ul-Mejid, 
was born on the 21st of September 1840. On the accession of 
his uncle Abd-ul-Aziz, Prince Mahommed Murad Effendi — 
as he was then called — was deprived of all share in public 
affairs and imprisoned, owing to his opposition to the sultan's 
plan for altering the order of succession. On the deposition of 
Abd-ul-Aziz on the 30th of May 1876, Murad was haled from his 
prison by a mob of softas and soldiers of the " Young Turkey " 
party under Suleiman Pasha, and proclaimed " emperor by the 
grace of God and the will of the people." Three months later, 
however, his health, undermined by his long confinement, gave 
way; and on the 31st of August he was deposed to make room 
for his younger brother, Abd-ul-Hamid II. He was kept in 
confinement in the Cheragan palace till his death on the 29th of 
August 1904.

applied to the whole genus of fishes to which the Mediterranean 
species belongs, and which is abundantly represented in tropical 
and sub-tropical seas, especially in rocky parts or on coral reefs. 
Some ninety species are known. In the majority a long fin 
runs from the head along the back, round the tail to the vent,

but all are destitute of pectoral and ventral fins. The skin is 
scaleless and smooth, in many species ornamented with varied 
and bright colours, so that these fishes are frequently mistaken 
for snakes. The mouth is wide, the jaws strong and armed with 
formidable, generally sharply pointed, teeth, which enable the 
Muraena not only to seize its prey (which chiefly consists of 
other fishes) but also to inflict serious, and sometimes danger- 
ous, wounds on its enemies. It attacks persons who approach 
its places of concealment in shallow water, and is feared by 
fishermen. 

Some of the tropical Muraenas exceed a length of 10 ft., but 
most of the species, among them the Mediterranean species, 
attain to only half that length. The latter, the " morena " of 
the Italians and the Muraena helena of ichthyologists, was 
considered by the ancient Romans to be one of the greatest 
delicacies, and was kept in large ponds and aquaria. It is not 
confined to the coasts of southern Europe, but is spread over the 
Indian Ocean, and is not uncommon on the coasts of Australia. 
Its body is generally of a rich brown, marked with large yellowish 
spots, each of which contains smaller brown spots. 

MURAL DECORATION, a general term for the art of ornament- 
ing wall surfaces. There is scarcely one of the numerous 
branches of decorative art which has not at some time or other 
been applied to this purpose. 1 For what may be called the 
practical or furnishing point of view, see Wall-coverings. 
Here the subject is treated rather as part of the history of art. 

x. Reliefs sculptured in Marble or Stone. — This is the oldest 
method of wall-decoration, of which numerous examples exist. 
The tombs and temples of Egypt are rich in this kind of mural 
ornament of various dates, extending over nearly 5000 years. 
These sculptures are, as a rule, carved in low relief; in many cases 
they are " counter-sunk," that is, the most projecting parts of 
the figures do not extend beyond the flat surface of the ground. 
Some unfinished reliefs discovered in the rock-cut tombs of 
Thebes show the manner in which the sculptor set to work. 
The plain surface of the stone was marked out by red lines into a 
number of squares of equal size. The use of this was probably 
twofold: first, as a guide in enlarging the design from a small 
drawing, a method still commonly practised; second, to help the 
artist to draw his figures with just proportions, following the 
strict canons which were laid down by the Egyptians. No 
excessive realism or individuality of style arising from a careful 
study of the life-model was permitted. 2 When the surface had 
been covered with these squares, the artist drew with a brush 
dipped in red the outlines of his relief, and then cut round them 
with his chisel. 

When the relief was finished, it was, as a rule, entirely painted 
over with much minuteness and great variety of colours. More 
rarely the ground was left the natural tint of the stone or marble, 
and only the figures and hieroglyphs painted. In the case of 
sculpture in hard basalt or granite the painting appears often 
to have been omitted altogether. The absence of perspective 
effects and the severe self-restraint of the sculptors in the matter 
of composition show a sense of artistic fitness in this kind of 
decoration. That the rigidity of these sculptured pictures did 
not arise from want of skill or observation of nature on the part 
of the artists is apparent when we examine their representations 
of birds and animals; the special characteristics of each creature 
and species were unerringly caught by the ancient Egyptian, 
and reproduced in stone or colour, in a half-symbolic way, 
suggesting those peculiarities of form, plumage, or movement 
which are the " differentia " of each, other ideas bearing less 
directly on the point being eliminated. 

The subjects of these mural sculptures are endless; almost 
every possible incident in man's life here or beyond the grave 
is reproduced with the closest detail. The tomb of Tih at 
Sakkarah (about 4^00 B.C.) has some of the finest and earliest 
specimens of these mural sculptures, especially rich in illustra-

&c. 

* During the earliest times — more than 4000 years before our era 
— there appear to have been exceptions to this rule. 



tions of the domestic life and occupations of the Egyptians. 
The latter tombs, as a rule, have sculptures depicting the religious 
ritual and belief of the people, and the temples combine these 
hieratic subjects with the history of the reigns and victores of 
the Egyptian kings. 

The above remarks as to style and manner of execution may 
be applied also to the wall-sculptures from the royal palaces of 
Nineveh and Babylon, the finest of which are shown by inscrip- 
tions to date from the time of Sennacherib to that of Sardana- 
palus (from 705 to 625 B.C.). These are carved in low relief with 
almost gem-like delicacy of detail on enormous slabs of white 
marble. The sacred subjects, generally representing the king 
worshipping one of the numerous Assyrian gods, are mostly 
large, often colossal in scale. The other subjects, illustrating 
the life and amusements of the king, his prowess in war or 
hunting, or long processions of prisoners and tribute-bearers 
coming to do him homage, are generally smaller and in some cases 
very minute in scale (fig. 1). The arrangement of these reliefs

in long horizontal bands, and their reserved conventional treat- 
ment are somewhat similar to those of ancient Egypt, but they 
show a closer attention to anatomical truth and a greater 
love for dramatic effect than any of the Egyptian reliefs. As in 
the art of Egypt, birds and animals are treated with greater 
realism than human figures. A relief in the British Museum, 
representing a lioness wounded by an arrow in her spine and 
dragging helplessly her paralysed hind legs, affords an example 
of wonderful truth and pathos. Remarkable technical skill is 
shown in all these sculptures by the way in which the sculptors 
have obtained the utmost amount of effect with the smallest 
possible amount of relief, in this respect calling strongly to mind 
a similar peculiarity in the work of the Florentine Donatello. 

The palace at Mashita on the hajj road in Moab, built by the 
Sasanian Chosroes II. (a.d. 614-627), is ornamented on the 
exterior with beautiful surface sculpture in stone. The designs 
are of peculiar interest as forming a link between Assyrian and 
Byzantine art, and they are not remotely connected with the 
decoration on Moslem buildings of comparatively modern 
date. 3 

Especially in Italy during the middle ages a similar treatment 

* Among the Mashita carvings occurs that oldest and most widely 
spread of all forms of Aryan ornament — the sacred tree between two 
animals. The sculptured slab over the " lion-gate " at Mycenae 
has the other common variety of this motive — the fire-altar between 
the beasts. These designs, occasionally varied by figures of human 
worshippers instead of the beasts, survived long after their meaning 
had been forgotten ; even down to the present day they frequently 
appear on carpets and other textiles of Oriental manufacture. 



MURAL DECORATION

of marble in low relief was frequently used for wall-decoration. 
The most notable example is the beautiful series of reliefs on the 
west front of Orvieto Cathedral, the work of Giovanni Pisano and 
his pupils in the early part of the 14th century. These are small 
reliefs, illustrative of the Old and New Testaments, of graceful 
design and skilful execution. A growth of branching foliage 
serves to unite and frame the tiers of subjects. 

Of a widely different class, but of considerable importance in 
the history of mural decoration, are the beautiful reliefs, sculp- 
tured in stone and marble, with which Moslem buildings in 
many parts of the world are ornamented. These are mostly 
geometrical patterns of great intricacy, which cover large 
surfaces, frequently broken up into panels by bands of more 
flowing ornament or Arabic inscriptions. The mosques of 
Cairo, India and Persia, and the domestic Moslem buildings of 
Spain are extremely rich in this method of decoration. In 
western Europe, especially during the 15th century, stone 
panelled-work with rich tracery formed a large part of the scheme 
of decoration in all the more splendid buildings. Akin to this, 
though without actual relief, is the stone tracery — inlaid flush 
into rough flint walls — which was a mode of ornament largely 
used for enriching the exteriors of churches in the counties of 
Norfolk and Suffolk. It is almost peculiar to that district, and 
is an example of the skill and taste with which the medievai 
builders adapted their method of ornamentation to the materials 
in hand. 

2. Marble Veneer. — Another widely used method of mural 
decoration has been the application of thin marble linings to 
wall-surfaces, the decorative effect being produced by the natural 
beauty of the marble itself and not by sculptured reliefs. One of 
the oldest buildings in the world, the so-called " Temple of the 
Sphinx " among the Giza pyramids, is built of great blocks of 
granite, the inside of the rooms being lined with slabs of semi- 
transparent African alabaster about 3 in. thick. In the 1st cen- 
tury thin veneers of richly coloured marbles were largely used 
by the Romans to decorate brick and stone walls. Pliny (H. N. 
xxxvi. 6) speaks of this practice as being a new and degenerate 
invention in his time. Many examples exist at Pompeii and in 
other Roman buildings. Numerous Byzantine churches, such 
as St Saviour's at Constantinople, and St George's, Thessalonica, 
have the lower part of the internal walls richly ornamented in 
this way. It was commonly used to form a dado, the upper part 
of the building being covered with mosaic. The cathedral of 
Monrealc and other Siculo-Norman buildings owe a great deal 
of their splendour to these linings of richly variegated marbles. 
In most cases the main surface is of light-coloured marble or 
alabaster, inlaid bands of darker tint or coloured mosaic being 
used to divide the surface into panels. The peculiar I tali an - 
Gothic of northern and central Italy during the 14th and 15th 
centuries, and at Venice some centuries earlier, relied greatly 
for its effects on this treatment of marble. St Mark's at Venice 
and the cathedral of Florence are magnificent examples of this 
work used externally. Both inside and out most of the richest 
examples of Moslem architecture owe much to this method of 
decoration ; the mosques and palaces of India and Persia are in 
many cases completely lined with the most brilliant sorts of 
marble of contrasting tints. 

3. Wall-Linings of Glazed Bricks or Tiles. — This is a Very 
important class of decoration, and from its almost imperishable 
nature, its richness of colour, and its brilliance of surface is 
capable of producing a splendour of effect only rivalled by glass 
mosaics. In the less important form — that of bricks modelled 
or stamped in relief with figures and inscriptions, and then coated 
with a brilliant colour in siliceous enamel — it was largely used 
by the ancient Egyptians and Assyrians as well as by the later 
Sasanians of Persia. In the nth and 12th centuries the Moslems 
of Persia brought this art to great- perfection, and used it on a 
large scale, chiefly, though not invariably, for internal walls. 
The main surfaces were covered by thick earthenware tiles, 
overlaid with a white enamel. These were not rectangular, but 
of various shapes, mostly some form of a star, arranged so as to 
fit closely together. Delicate and minute patterns were then 



painted on the tiles, after the first firing, in a copper-like colour 
with strong metallic lustre, produced by the deoxidization of 
a metallic salt in the process of the second firing. Bands and 
friezes with Arabic inscriptions, modelled boldly in high relief, 
were used .to break up the monotony of the surface. In these, 
as a rule, the projecting letters were painted blue, and the flat 
ground enriched with very minute patterns in the lustre-colour. 
This combination of bold relief and delicate painting produces 
great vigour and richness of effect, equally telling whether viewed 
in the mass or closely examined tile by tile. In the 15th century 
lustre-colours, though still largely employed for plates, vases and 
other vessels, especially in Spain, were little used for tiles; and 
another class of ware, rich in the variety and brilliance of its 
colours, was extensively used by Moslem builders all over the 
Mahommedan world. The most sumptuous sorts of tiles used 
lor wall-coverings are those of the so-called " Rhodian " and 
Damascene wares, the work of Persian potters at many places. 
Those made at Rhodes are coarsely executed in comparison with 
the produce of the older potteries at Isfahan and Damascus 
(see Ceramics). These are rectangular tiles of earthenware, 
covered with a white " slip," and painted in brilliant colours with 
slight conventionalized representations of various flowers, 
especially the rose, the hyacinth and the carnation. The red 
used is applied in considerable body, so as to stand out in slight 
relief. Another class of design is more geometrical, forming 
regular repeats; but the most beautiful compositions are those 
in which the natural growth of trees and flowers is imitated, the 
branches and blossoms spreading over a large surface covered by 
hundreds of tiles without any repetition. One of the finest 
examples is the " Mecca wall " in the mosque of Ibrahim Agha, 
Cairo; and other Egyptian mosques are adorned in the same way 
(fig. 2). Another variety, the special production of Damascus, 




Fig. 2.— One of the Wall-tiles from the Mosque of Ibrahim 
Agha, Cairo. (10 in. square.) 

has the design almost entirely executed in blue. It was about 
a.d. 1600, in the reign of Shah Abbas I., that this class of pottery 
was brought to greatest perfection, and it is in Persia that the 
most magnificent examples are found, dating from the 12th to 
the 17th centuries. The most remarkable examples for beauty 
and extent are the mosque at Tabriz, built by AH Khoja in the 
1 2th century, the ruined tomb of Sultan Khodabend (a.d. 1303- 
r3i6) at Sultaniyas, the palace of Shah Abbas I. and the tomb 
of Abbas II. (d. a.d. 1666) at Isfahan, all of which buildings are 
covered almost entirely inside and out. 

Another important class of wall-tiles are those manufactured 
by the Spanish Moors, called " azulejos," especially during the 
14th century. These are in a very different style, being designed 



i8 



MURAL DECORATION 



to suggest or imitate mosaic. They have intricate inter- 
lacing geometrical patterns marked out by lines in slight 
relief; brilliant enamel colours were then burned into the tile, 
the projecting lines forming boundaries for the pigments. A 
rich effect is produced by this combination of relief and colour. 
They are mainly used for dadoes about 4 ft. high, often sur- 
mounted by a band of tiles with painted inscriptions. The 
Alhambra and Generalife Palaces at Granada, begun in the 
13th century, but mainly built and decorated by Yusuf I. and 
Mahommed V. (a.d. 1333-1391), and the Alcazar at Seville have 
the most beautiful examples of these " azulejos." The latter 
building chiefly owes its decorations to Pedro the Cruel (a.d. 
1364), who employed Moorish workmen for its tile-coverings 
and other ornaments. Many other buildings in southern Spain 
are enriched in the same way, some as late as the 16th century. 

Almost peculiar to Spain are a variety of wall-tile the work of 
Italians in the 16th and 17th centuries. These are effective, 
though rather coarsely painted, and have a rich yellow as the 
predominant colour. The Casa de Pilatos and Isabel's Chapel 
in the Alcazar Palace, both at Seville, have the best specimens 
of these, dating about the year 1500. In other Western countries 
tiles have been used more for pavements than for wall-decoration. 

4. Wall-Coverings of Hard Stucco , frequently enriched with 
Reliefs. — The Greeks and Romans possessed the secret of making 
a hard kind of stucco, creamy in colour, and capable of receiving 
a polish like that of marble; it would stand exposure to the 
weather. Those of the early Greek temples which were built, 
not of marble, but of stone, such as the Doric temples at Aegina, 
Phigaleia, Paestum and Agrigentum, were all entirely coated 
inside and out with this material, an admirable surface for the 
further polychromatic decoration with which all Greek buildings 
seem to have been ornamented. Another highly artistic use 
of stucco among the Greeks and Romans, for the interiors of 
buildings, consisted in covering the walls and vaults with a 
smooth coat, on which while still wet the outlines of figures,

Fig. 3. — Modelled Stucco Wall-Relief, from a Tomb in Magna 
Graecia. (About half full size.) 

groups and other ornaments were sketched with a point; more 
stucco was then applied in lumps and rapidly modelled into 
delicate relief before it had time to set. Some tombs in Magna 
Graecia of the 4th century B.C. are decorated in this way with 



figures of nymphs, cupids, animals and wreaths, all of which are 
models of grace and elegance, and remarkable for the dexterous 
way in which a few rapid touches of the modelling tool or thumb 
have produced a work of the highest artistic beauty (fig. 3). 
Roman specimens of this sort of decoration are common, fine 
examples have been found in the baths of Titus and numerous 
tombs near Rome, as well as in many of the houses of Pompeii. 




Fig. 4. — Stucco Wall-Relief, from the Alhambra. 

These are mostly executed with great skill and frequently 
with good taste, though in some cases, especially at Pompeii, 
elaborate architectural compositions with awkward attempts at 
effects of violent perspective, modelled in slight relief on flat 
wall-surfaces, produce an unpleasing effect. Other Pompeian 
examples, where the surface is divided into flat panels, each 
containing a figure or group, have great merit for their delicate 
richness, without offending against the canons of wall-decoration, 
one of the first conditions of which is that no attempt should be 
made to disguise the fact of its being a solid wall and a flat 
surface. 

The Moslem architects of the middle ages made great use of 
stucco ornament both for external and internal walls. The 
stucco is modelled in high or low relief in great variety of geo- 
metrical patterns, alternating with bands of more flowing 
ornament or long Arabic inscriptions. Many of their buildings, 
such as the mosque of Tulun at Cairo (a.d. 879), owe nearly all 
their beauty to this fine stucco work, the purely architectural 
shell of the structure being often simple and devoid of ornament. 
These stucco reliefs were, as a rule, further decorated with 
delicate painting in gold and colours. The Moorish tower at 
Segovia in Spain is a good example of this class of ornament used 
externally. With the exception of a few bands of brick and the 
stone quoins at the angles, the whole exterior of the tower is 
covered with a network of stucco reliefs in simple geometrical 
patterns. The Alhambra at Granada and the Alcazar at Seville 
have the richest examples of this work. The lower part of the 
walls is lined with marble or tiles to a height of about 4 ft. and 
above that in many cases the whole surface is encrusted with 
these reliefs, the varied surface of which, by producing endless 
gradations of shadow, takes away any possible harshness from 
the brilliance of the gold and colours (fig. 4). 

During the 16th century, and even earlier, stucco wall-reliefs 
were used with considerable skill and decorative effect in Italy, 
England and other Western countries. Perhaps the most graceful 



MURAL DECORATION 



r 9 



examples are the reliefs with which Vasari in the 16th century 
encrusted pillars and other parts of the court in the Florentine 
Palazzo Vecchio, built of plain stone by Michelozzo in 1454. 
Some are of flowing vines and other plants winding spirally 
round the columns. The English examples of this work are 
effectively designed, though coarser in execution. The outside 
of a half-timbered house in the market-place at Newark-upon- 
Trent has high reliefs in stucco of canopied figures, dating from 
the end of the 1 5th century. The counties of Essex and Suffolk 
are rich in examples of this work used externally; and many 
16th-century houses in England have fine internal stucco 
decoration, especially Hardwicke Hall (Derbyshire), one of the 
rooms of which has the upper part of the wall enriched with 
life-sized stucco figures in high relief, forming a deep frieze all 
round. 

5. Sgraffito. — This is a variety of stucco work used chiefly in 
Italy from the 16th century downwards, and employed only for 
exteriors of buildings, especially the palaces of Tuscany and 
northern Italy. The wall is covered with a coat of stucco made 
black by an admixture of charcoal; over this a second thin coat 
of white stucco is laid. When it is all hard the design is produced 
by cutting and scratching away the white skin, so as to show the 
black under-coat. Thus the drawing appears in black on a white 
ground. This work is effective at a distance, as it requires a 
bold style of handling, in which the shadows are indicated by 
cross-hatched lines more or less near together. 1 Flowing ara- 
besques mixed with grotesque figures occur most frequently in 
sgraffito. In recent years the sgraffito method has been revived; 
and the result of Mr Moody's experiments may be seen on the 
east wall of the Royal College of Science in Exhibition Road, 
London. 

6. Stamped Leather. — This was a magnificent and expensive 
form of wall-hanging, chiefly used during the 16th and 17th 
centuries. Skins, generally of goats or calves, were well tanned 
and cut into rectangular shapes. They were then covered with 




Fig. 5. — Italian Stamped Leather; 16th century. 
silver leaf, which was varnished with a transparent yellow lacquer 
making the silver look like gold. The skins were then stamped 
or embossed with patterns in relief, formed by heavy pressure 
from metal dies, one in relief and the other sunk. The reliefs 
were then painted by hand in many colours, generally brilliant 
1 A good description of the process is given by Vasari, Tre arii del 
disegno, cap. xxvi. 



in tone. Italy and Spain (especially Cordova) were important 
seats of this manufacture; and in the 17th century a large 
quantity was produced in France. Fig. 5 gives a good example 
of Italian stamped leather of the 16th century. In England, 
chiefly at Norwich, this manufacture was carried on in the 
17th and 18th centuries. In durability and richness of effect 
stamped leather surpasses most other forms of movable wall- 
decoration. 

7. Painted Cloth. — Another form of wall-hanging, used most 
largely during the 15th and 16th centuries, and in a less extensive 
way a .good deal earlier, is canvas painted to imitate tapestry. 
English medieval inventories both of ecclesiastical and domestic 
goods frequently contain items such as these: " stayned cloths 
for hangings," "paynted cloths with stories 'and batailes," or 
" paynted cloths of beyond sea work," or " of Flaunder's work." 
Many good artists working at Ghent and Bruges during the first 
half of the 15th century produced fine work of this class, as well 
as designs for real tapestry. Several of the great Italian artists 
devoted their skill in composition and invention to the painting 
of these wall-hangings. The most important existing example 
is the series of paintings of the triumph of Julius Caesar executed 
by Andrea Mantegna (148 5- 149 2) for Ludovico Gonzaga, duke 
of Mantua, and now at Hampton Court. These are usually, 
but wrongly, called " cartoons," as if they were designs meant 
to be executed in tapestry; this is not the case, as the paintings 
themselves were used as wall-hangings. They are nine in number 
and each compartment, 9 ft. square, was separated from the next 
by a pilaster. They form a continuous procession, with life- 
sized figures, remarkable for their composition, drawing and 
delicate colouring — the latter unfortunately much disguised by 
" restoration." Like most of these^ painted wall-hangings, 
they are executed in tempera, and rather thinly painted, so 
that the pigment might not crack off through the cloth falling 
slightly into folds. Another remarkable series of painted cloth 
hangings are those at Reims Cathedral. In some cases dyes 
were used for this work. A MS. of the 15th century gives 
receipts for " painted cloth," showing that sometimes they were 
dyed in a manner similar to those Indian stuffs which were 
afterwards printed, and are now called chintzes. These 
receipts are for real dyes, not for pigments, and among them 
is the earliest known description of the process called "setting" 
the woad or indigo vat, as well as a receipt for removing or 
" discharging " the colour from a cloth already dyed. Another 
method employed was a sort of " encaustic " process; the cloth 
was rubbed all over with wax, and then painted in tempera; 
heat was then applied so that the colours sank into the melting 
wax, and were thus firmly fixed upon the cloth. 

8. Printed Hangings and Wall-Papers. — The printing of 
various textiles with dye-colours and mordants is probably one 
of the most ancient arts. Pliny {H. N. xxxv.) describes a 
dyeing process employed by the ancient Egyptians, in which 
the pattern was probably formed by printing from blocks. 
Various methods have been used for this work — wood blocks in 
relief, engraved metal plates, stencil plaies and even hand- 
painting; frequently two or more of these methods have 
been employed for the same pattern. The use of printed stuffs 
is of great antiquity among the Hindus and Chinese, and 
was certainly practised in western Europe in the 13th century, 
and perhaps earlier. The Victoria and Albert Museum has 
13th-century specimens of block-printed silk made in Sicily, of 
beautiful design. Towards the end of the 14th century a 
great deal of block-printed linen was made in Flanders, and 
largely imported into England. 

Wall-papers did not come into common use in Europe till the 
1 8th century, though they appear to have been used much 
earlier by the Chinese. A few rare examples exist in England 
which may be as early as the 16th century; these are imitations, 
generally in flock, of the fine old Florentine and Genoese cut 
velvets, and hence the style of the design in no way shows the 
date of the wall-paper, the same traditional patterns being 
reproduced for many years with little or no change. Machinery 
enabling paper to be made in long strips was not invented till 



20 



MURAL DECORATION 



the end of the 18th century, and up to that time wall-papers 
were printed on small square pieces of hand-made paper, difficult 
to hang, disfigured by numerous joints, and comparatively 
costly; on these accounts wall-papers were slow in superseding 
the older modes of mural decoration. A little work by Jackson 
of Battersea, printed in London in 1744, throws some light on , 
the use of wall-papers at that time. He gives reduced copies 
of his designs, mostly taken from Italian pictures or antique 
sculpture during his residence in Venice. Instead of flowing 
patterns covering the wall, his designs are all pictures — land- 
scapes, architectural scenes or statues — treated as panels, with 
plain paper or painting between. They are all printed in oil, 
with wooden blocks worked with a rolling press, apparently an

9. Painting. — This is naturally the most important and the 
most widely used of all forms of wall-decoration, as well as 
perhaps the earliest. 

Egypt (see Egypt: Art and Archaeology) is the chief store- 
house of ancient specimens of this, as of almost all the arts. 
Owing to the intimate connexion between the 
Printings, sculpture and painting of early times, the remarks 
above as to subjects and treatment under the head 
of Egyptian wall-sculpture will to a great extent apply also to 
the paintings. It is an important fact, which testifies to the 
antiquity of Egyptian civilization, that the earliest paintings, 
dating more than 4000 years before our era, are also the cleverest 
both in drawing and execution. In later times the influence of 
Egyptian art, especially in painting, was important even among 



distant nations. In the 6th century B.C. Egyptian colonists, 
introduced by Cambyses into Persepolis, influenced the painting 
and sculpture of the great Persian Empire and throughout the 
valley of the Euphrates. In a lesser degree the art of Babylon 
and Nineveh had felt considerable Egyptian influence several 
centuries earlier. The same influence affected the early art of 
the Greeks and the Etrurians, and it was not till the middle of 
the 5th century B.C. that the further development and perfecting 
of art in Greece obliterated the old traces of Egyptian mannerism. 
After the death of Alexander the Great, when Egypt came into 
the possession of the Lagidae (320 B.C.), the tide of influence 
flowed the other way, and Greek art modified though it did not 
seriously alter the characteristics of Egyptian painting and 
sculpture, which retained much of their early formalism and 
severity. Yet the increased sense of beauty, especially in the 
human face, derived from the Greeks was counterbalanced by 
loss of vigour; art under the Ptolemies became a dull copyism 
of earlier traditions. 

The general scheme of mural painting in the buildings of 
ancient Egypt was complete and magnificent. Columns, 
mouldings and other architectural features were enriched with 
patterns in brilliant colours; the fiat wall-spaces were covered 
with figure-subjects, generally in horizontal bands, and the 
ceilings were ornamented with sacred symbols, such as the vulture 
or painted blue and studded with gold stars to symbolize the 
sky. The wall-paintings are executed in tempera on a thin skin

of fine lime, laid over the brick, stone or marble to form a smooth 
and slightly absorbent coat to receive the pigments, which were 
most brilliant in tone and of great variety of tint. Not employing 
fresco, the Egyptian artists were not restricted to " earth colours," 
but occasionally used purples, pinks and greens which would 
have been destroyed by fresh lime. The blue used is very 
beautiful, and is generally laid on in considerable body— it is 
frequently a " smalt " or deep-blue glass, coloured by copper 
oxide, finely powdered. Red and yellow ochre, carbon-hlack, 
and powdered chalk-white are most largely used. Though in 
the paintings of animals and birds considerable realism is often 
seen (fig. 7), yet for human figures certain conventional colours 
are employed, e.g. white for females' flesh, red for the males, or 
black to indicate people of negro race. Heads are painted in 
profile, and little or no shading is used. Considerable knowledge 
of harmony is shown in the arrangement of the colours; and 
otherwise harsh combinations of tints are softened and brought 
into keeping by thin separating lines of white or yellow. Though 
at first sight the general colouring, if seen in a museum, may 
appear crude, yet it should he remembered that the internal 
paintings were much softened by the dim light in Egyptian 
buildings, and those outside were subdued by contrast with the 
brilliant sunshine under which they were always seen. 

The rock-cut sepulchres of the Etrurians supply the only 
existing specimens of their mural painting; and, unlike the 
tombs of Egypt, only a small proportion appear to BOvscsta 
have been decorated in this way. The actual dates p a j a tiag t 
of these paintings are very uncertain, but they range 
possibly from about the 8th century B.C. down to almost the 
Christian era. The tombs which possess these paintings are

mostly square-shaped rooms, with slightly-arched or gabled roofs, 
excavated in soft sandstone or tufa hillsides. The earlier ones 
show Egyptian influence in drawing and in composition: they 
are broadly designed with flat unshaded tints, the faces in profile, 
except the eyes, which are drawn as if seen in front. Colours, as 
in Egypt, are used conventionally — male flesh red, white or 
pale yellow for the females, black for demons. In one respect 
these paintings differ from those of the Egyptians; few colours 
are used — red, brown, and yellow ochres, carbon-black, lime or 
chalk-white, and occasionally blue are the only pigments. The 
rock-walls are prepared by being covered with a thin skin of 
lime stucco, and lime or chalk is mixed in small quantities with 
all the colours; hence the restriction to " earth pigments," made 
necessary by the dampness of these subterranean chambers. 
The process employed was in fact a kind of fresco, though the 
stucco ground was not applied in small patches only sufficient 
for the day's work; the dampness of the rock was enough to 
keep the stucco skin moist, and so allow the necessary infiltration 
of colour from the surface. Many of these paintings when first 
discovered were fresh in tint and uninjured by time, but they are 
soon dulled by exposure to light. In the course of centuries 
great changes of style naturally took place; the early Egyptian 
influence, probably brought to Etruria through the Phoenician 
traders, was succeeded by an even more strongly-marked Greek 
influence — at first archaic and stiff, then developing into great 
beauty of drawing, and finally yielding to the Roman spirit, as 
the degradation of Greek art advanced under their powerful but 
inartistic Roman conquerors. 

Throughout this succession of styles — Egyptian, Greek and 
Graeco-Roman — there runs a distinct undercurrent of individu- 
ality due to the Etruscans themselves. This appears not only 
in the drawing but also in the choice of subjects. In addition 
to pictures of banquets with musicians and dancers, hunting 
and racing scenes, the workshops of different craftsmen and other 
domestic subjects, all thoroughly Hellenic in sentiment, other 
paintings occur which are very un-Greek in feeling. These 
represent the judgment and punishment of souls in a future life. 
Mantus, Charun and other infernal deities of the Rasena, 
hideous in aspect and armed with hammers, or furies depicted 
as black-bearded demons winged and brandishing live~ snakes, 
terrify or torture shrinking human souls. Others, not the earliest 
in date, represent human sacrifices, such as those at the tomb of 
Patroclus — a class of subjects which, though Homeric, appears 
rarely to have been selected by Greek painters. The constant 
import into Etruria of large quantities of fine Greek painted 
vases appears to have contributed to keep up the supremacy of 
Hellenic influence during many centuries, and by their artistic 
superiority to have prevented the development of a more original 
and native school of art. Though we now know Etruscan 
painting only from the tombs, yet Pliny mentions (H. N. xxxv. 3) 
that fine wall-paintings existed in his time, with colours yet 
fresh, on the walls of ruined temples at Ardea and Lanuvium, 
executed, he says, before the founding of Rome. As before men- 
tioned, the actual dates of the existing paintings are uncertain. 
It cannot therefore be asserted that any existing specimens are 
much older than 600 B.C., though some, especially at Veii, 
certainly appear to have the characteristics of more remote 
antiquity. The most important of these paintings have been 
discovered in the cemeteries of Veii, Caere, Tarquinii, Vulci, 
Cervetri and other Etruscan cities. 

Even in Egypt the use of colour docs not appear to have been 
more universal than it was among the Greeks (see Greek Art), 
who applied it freely to their marble statues and 
reliefs, the whole of their buildings inside and out, 
as well as for the decoration of flat wall-surfaces. 
They appear to have cared little for pure form, and not to have 
valued the delicate ivory-like tint and beautiful texture of their 
fine Pentelic and Parian marbles, except as a ground for coloured 
ornament. A whole class of artists, called Lyakiibruv kytcavaTai, 
were occupied in colouring marble sculpture, and their services 
were very highly valued. 1 In some cases, probably for the sake of

hiding the joints and getting a more absorbent surface, the 
marble, however pure and fine in texture, was covered with a 
thin skin of stucco made of mixed lime and powdered marble. 
An alabaster sarcophagus, found in a tomb near Corneto, and 
now in the Etruscan museum at Florence, is decorated outside 
with beautiful purely Greek paintings, executed on a stucco 
skin as hard and smooth as the alabaster. The pictures represent 
combats of the Greeks and Amazons. The colouring, though 
rather brilliant, is simply treated, and the figures are kept 
strictly to one plane without any attempt at complicated 
perspective. Other valuable specimens of Greek art, found at 
Herculaneum arid now in the Naples Museum, are some small 
paintings, one of girls playing with dice, another of Theseus and 
the Minotaur. These are painted with miniature-like delicacy on 
the bare surface of marble slabs; they are almost monochromatic, 
and are of the highest beauty both in drawing and in gradations 
of shadow — quite unlike any of the Greek vase-paintings. The 
first-mentioned painting is signed AAEEANAPOS A@HNAI02. 
It is probable that the strictly archaic paintings of the Greeks, 
such as those of Polygnotus in the 5th century B.C., executed 
with few and simple colours, had much resemblance to those on 
vases, but Pliny is wrong when he asserts that, till the time of 
Apelles (c. 350-310 B.C.), the Greek painters only used black, 
white, red and yellow, 2 Judging from the peculiar way in which 
the Greeks and their imitators the Romans used the names of 
colours, it appears that they paid more attention to tones and 
relations of colour than to actual hues. Thus most Greek and 
Latin colour-names arc now untranslatable. Homer's " wine- 
like sea " (olvonp), Sophocles's " wine-coloured ivy " ((Ed. Col.), 
and Horace's " purpureus olor " probably refer less to what we 
should call colour than to the chromatic strength of the various 
objects and their more or less strong powers of reflecting light, 
either in motion or when at rest. Nor have we any word like 
Virgil's " flavus," which could be applied both to a lady's hair 
and to the leaf of an olive-tree. 3 

During the best periods of Greek art the favourite classes of 
subjects were scenes from poetry, especially Homer and con- 
temporary history. The names invaKo6i}Kq and ctqo. ttolklXt] 
were given to many public buildings from their walls being 
covered with paintings. Additional interest was given to the 
historical subjects by the introduction of portraits; e.g. in the 
great picture of the battle of Marathon (490 B.C.), on the walls of 
the CTob. ttolklKi) in Athens, portraits were given of the Greek 
generals Miltiades, Callimachus, and others. This picture was 
painted about forty years after the battle by Polygnotus and 
Micon. One of the earliest pictures recorded by Pliny (xxxv. 8) 
represented a battle of the Magnesians (c. 716 B.C.); it was 
painted by Bularchus, a Lydian artist, and bought at a high 
price by King Candaulcs. Many other important Greek 
historical paintings are mentioned by Pausanias and earlier 
writers. The Pompeian mosaic of the defeat of the Persians by 
Alexander is probably a Romanized copy from some celebrated 
Greek painting; it obviously was not designed for mosaic 
wtfrk. 

Landscape painting appears to have been unknown among the 
Greeks, even as a background to figure-subjects. The poems 
especially of Homer and Sophocles show that this was not through 
want of appreciation of the beauties of nature, but partly, 
probably, because the main object of Greek painting was to tell 
some definite story, and also from their just sense of artistic 
fitness, which prevented them from attempting in their mural 
decorations to disguise the flat solidity of the walls by delusive 
effects of aerial perspective and distance. 

It is interesting to note that even in the time of Alexander 
the Great the somewhat archaic works of the -earlier painters 
were still appreciated. In particular Aristotle praises Polygnotus, 

* Pliny's remarks on subjects such as this should be received with 
caution. He was neither a scientific archaeologist nor a practical 
artist. 

* So also a meaning unlike ours is attached to Greek technical 
words — by rhvos they meant, not " tone," but the gradations of 
light and shade, and by apt^yif the relations of colour. See Pliny, 
H. N. xxxv. 5 ; and Ruskin, Mod. Painters, pt. iv, cap. 13.

both for his power of combining truth with idealization 
in his portraits and for his skill in depicting men's mental 
characteristics; on this account he calls him 6 #?<>Yp&<£os. 
Lucian too praises Polygnotus alike for his grace, drawing and 
colouring. Later painters, such as Zeuxis and Apelles, appear 
to have produced easel pictures more than mural 8 paintings, 
and these, being easy to move, were mostly carried of! to Rome 
by the early emperors. Hence Pausanias, who visited Greece 
in the time of Hadrian, mentions but few works of the later 
artists. Owing to the lack of existing specimens of Greek 
painting it would be idle to attempt an account of their technical 
methods, but no doubt those employed by the Romans described 
below were derived with the rest of their art from the Greeks. 
Speaking of their stucco, Pliny refers its superiority over that 
made by the Romans to the fact that it was always made of 
lime at least three years old, and that it was well mixed and 
pounded in a mortar before being laid on the wall; he is here 
speaking of the thick stucco in many coats, not of the thin skin 
mentioned above as being laid on marble. Greek mural painting, 
like their sculpture, was chiefly used to decorate temples and 
public buildings, and comparatively rarely either for tombs 1 or 
private buildings — at least in the days of their early republican 
simplicity. 

A large number of Roman mural paintings (see also Roman 
Art) now exist, of which many were discovered in the private 
houses and baths of Pompeii, nearly all dating 
Pahitiag. between a.d. 63, when the city was ruined by an 
earthquake, and a.d. 79, when it was buried by 
Vesuvius. A catalogue of these and similar paintings from Hercu- 
laneum and Stabiae, compiled by Professor Helbig, comprises 1 966 
specimens. The excavations in the baths of Titus and other 
ancient buildings in Rome, made in the early part of the 16th 
century, excited the keenest interest and admiration among the 
painters of that time, and largely influenced the later art of the 
Renaissance. These paintings, especially the " grotesques " 
or fanciful patterns of scroll-work and pilasters mixed with 
semi-realistic foliage and figures of boys, animals and birds, 
designed with great freedom of touch and inventive power, seem 
to have fascinated Raphael during his later period, and many of 
his pupils and contemporaries. The " loggie " of the Vatican 
and of the Farnesina palace are full of carefully studied 
16th-century reproductions of these highly decorative paintings. 
The excavations in Rome have brought to light some mural 
paintings of the 1st century a.d., perhaps superior in execution 
even to the best of the Pompeian series (see Plate). 

The range of subjects found in Roman mural paintings is large 
— mythology, religious ceremonies, genre, still life and even 
landscape (the latter generally on a small scale, and treated in an 
artificial and purely decorative way), and lastly history. Pliny 
mentions several large and important historical paintings, such 
as those with which Valerius Maximus Messala decorated the 
wallsof the Curia Hostilia, to commemorate his own victory over 
Hiero II. and the Carthaginians in Sicily in the 3rd century B.C. 
The earliest Roman painting recorded by Pliny was by Fabius, 
surnamed Pictor, on the walls of the temple of Salus, executed 
about 300 B.C. (H.N. xxxv. 4). 

Pliny (xxxv. 1) laments the fact that the wealthy Romans 
of his time preferred the costly splendours of marble and por- 
phyry wall-linings to the more artistic decoration of paintings 
by good artists. Historical painting seems then to have gone 
out of fashion; among the numerous specimens now existing 
few from Pompeii represent historical subjects; one has the 
scene of Massinissa and Sophonisba before Scipio, and another 
of a riot between the people of Pompeii and Nocera, which 
happened 59 a.d. 

Mythological scenes, chiefly from Greek sources, occur most 
frequently: the myths of Eros and Dionysus are especial 
favourites. Only five or six relate to purely Roman mythology. 

1 One instance only of a tomb-painting is mentioned by Pausanias 
(vii. 22). Some fine specimens have been discovered in the Crimea, 
but not of a very early date; see Stephani, Compte rendu, &c, 
(St Petersburg, 1878), &c. 



We have reason to think that some at least of the Pompeian. 
pictures are copies, probably at third or fourth hand, from 
celebrated Greek originals. The frequently repeated subjects 
of Medea meditating the murder of her children and Iphigenia 
at the shrine of the Tauric Artemis suggest that the motive 
and composition were taken from the originals of these subjects 
by Timanthes. Those of Io and Argus, the finest example of 
which is in the Palatine " villa of Li via " and of Andromeda 
and Perseus, often repeated on Pompeian walls, may be from 
the originals by Nicias. 

In many cases these mural paintings are of high artistic 
merit, though they are probably not the work of the most 
distinguished painters of the time, but rather of a humbler 
class of decorators, who reproduced, without much original 
invention, stock designs out of some pattern-book. They 
are, however, all remarkable for the rapid skill and extreme 
" verve " and freedom of hand with which the designs are, as 
it were, flung on to the walls with few but effective touches. 
Though in some cases the motive and composition are superior 
to the execution, yet many of the paintings are remarkable 
both for their realistic truth and technical skill. The great 
painting of Ceres from Pompeii, now in the Naples Museum, 
is a work of the highest merit. 

In the usual scheme of decoration the broad wall-surfaces are 
broken up into a series of panels by pilasters, columns, or other 
architectural forms. Some of the panels contain pictures with 
figure-subjects; others have conventional ornament, or hanging 
festoons of fruit and flowers. The lower part of the wall is 
painted one plain colour, forming a dado; the upper part some- 
times has a well-designed frieze of flowing ornaments. In the 
better class of painted walls the whole is kept flat in treatment, 
and is free from too great subdivision, but in many cases great 
want of taste is shown by the introduction of violent effects of 
architectural perspective, and the space is broken up by ccm- 
plicated schemes of design, studded with pictures in varying 
scales which have little relation to their surroundings. The 
colouring is on the whole pleasant and harmonious — unlike the 
usual chromo-lithographic copies. Black, yellow, or a rich deep 
red are the favourite colours for the main ground of the walls, 
the pictures in the panels being treated separately, each with its 
own background. 

An interesting series of early Christian mural paintings exists 
in various catacombs, especially those of Rome and Naples. 
They are Of value both as an important link in the Ear fy 
history of art and also as throwing light on the Christian 
mental state of the early Christians, which was dis- Paiatingin 
tinctly influenced by the older faith. Thus in the y * 
earlier paintings of about the 4th century we find Christ repre- 
sented as a beardless youth, beautiful as the artist could make 
him, with a lingering tradition of Greek idealization, in no degree 
like the " Man of Sorrows " of medieval painters, but rather 
a kind of genius of Christianity in whose fair outward form 
the peace and. purity of the new faith were visibly symbolized, 
just as certain distinct attributes were typified in the persons 
of the gods of ancient Greece. The favourite early subject, 
" Christ the Good Shepherd " (fig. 8), is represented as Orpheus 
playing on his lyre to a circle of beasts, the pagan origin of the 
picture being shown by the Phrygian cap and by the presence of 
lions, panthers and other incongruous animals among the listen- 
ing sheep. ' In other cases Christ is depicted standing with a sheep 
borne on His shoulders like Hermes Criophoros or Hermes 
Psychopompos — favourite Greek subjects, especially the former, 
a statue of which Pausanias (ix. 22) mentions as existing at 
Tanagra in Boeotia. Here again the pagan origin of the type 
is shown by the presence in the catacomb paintings of the pan- 
pipes and pedum, special attributes of Hermes, but quite foreign 
to the notion of Christ. Though in a degraded form, a good 
deal survives in some of these paintings, especially in the earlier 
ones, of the old classical grace of composition and beauty of 
drawing, notably in the above-mentioned representations where 
old models were copied without any adaptation to their new 
meaning. Those of the 5th and 6th centuries follow the classical

lines, though in a rapidly deteriorating style, until the introduc- 
tion of a foreign— -the Byzantine — element, which created a 
fresh starting-point on different lines. The old naturalism and 
survival of classical freedom of drawing is replaced by stiff, 
conventionally hieratic types, superior in dignity and strength 
to the feeble compositions produced by the degradation into 
which the native art of Rome had fallen. The designs of this 
second period of Christian art are similar to those of the mosaics,

such as many at Ravenna, and also to the magnificently illumi- 
nated MSS. For some centuries there was little change or 
development in this Byzantine style of art, so that it is impossible 
in most cases to be sure from internal evidence of the date of 
any painting. This to some extent applies also to the works 
of the earlier or pagan school, though, roughly speaking, it may 
be said that the least meritorious pictures are the latest in 
date. 

These catacomb paintings range over a long space of time; 
some may possibly be of the 1st or 2nd century, e.g. those 
in the cemetery of Domitilla, Rome; others are as late as the 
<)th century, e.g. some full-length figures of St Cornelius and 
St Cyprian in the catacomb of St Callixtus, under which earlier 
paintings may be traced. In execution they somewhat resemble 
the Etruscan tomb-paintings; the walls of the catacomb passages 
and chambers, excavated in soft tufa, are covered with a thin 
skin of white stucco, and on that the mural and ceiling paintings 
are simply executed in earth colours. The favourite subjects 
of the earliest paintings are scenes from the Old Testament 
which were supposed to typify events in the life of Christ, such 
as the sacrifice of Isaac (Christ's death), Jonah and the whale 
(the Resurrection), Moses striking the rock, or pointing to the 
manna (Christ the water of life, and the Eucharist), and many 
others. The later paintings deal more with later subjects, 
either events in Christ's life or figures of saints and the miracles 
they performed. A fine series of these exists in the iower church 
of S. Clemente in Rome, apparently dating from the 6th to the 
10th centuries; among these are representations of the passion 
and death of Christ — subjects never chosen by the earlier 
Christians, except as dimly foreshadowed by the Old Testament 
types. When Christ Himself is depicted in the early catacomb 
paintings it is in glory and power, not in His human weakness and 
suffering. 

Other early Italian paintings exist on the walls of the church 
of the Tre Fontane near Rome, and in the Capella di S. Urbano 
alia Caffarella, executed in the early part of the nth century. 
The atrium of S. Lorenzo fuori le mura, Rome, and the church 
of the Quattro Santi Incoronati have mural paintings of the 



first half of the 13th century, which show no artistic improve- 
ment over those at S. Clemente four or five centuries older. 

It was not in fact till the second half cf the 13th century 
that stiff traditional Byzantine forms and colouring began 
to be superseded by the revival of native art in Italy by 
the painters of Florence, Pisa and Siena. During the fiist 
thirteen centuries of the Christian era mural painting appears 
to have been for the most* part confined to the repre- 
sentation of sacred subjects. It is remarkable that during 
the earlier centuries council after council of the Christian 
Church forbade the painting of figure-subjects, and especially 
those of any Person of the Trinity; but in vain. In spite 
of the zeal of bishops and others, who sometimes with their 
own hands defaced the pictures of Christ on the walls of 
the churches, in spite of threats of excommunication, the for- 
bidden paintings by degrees became more numerous, till the walls 
of almost every church throughout Christendom were decorated 
with whole series of pictured stories. The useless prohibition 
was becoming obsolete when, towards the end of the 4th century, 
the learned Paulinus, bishop of Nola, ordered the two basilicas 
which he had built at Fondi and Nola to be adorned with wall- 
paintings of sacred subjects, with the special object, as he says, 
of instructing and refining the ignorant and drunken people. 
These painted histories were in fact the books of the unlearned, 
and we can now hardly realize their value as the chief mode of 
religious teaching in ages when none but the clergy could read 
or write. 

During the middle ages, just as long before among the ancient 
Greeks, coloured decoration was used in the widest possible 
manner not only for the adornment of flat walls, English 
but also for the enrichment of sculpture and all the Mural 
fittings and architectural features of buildings, P'tatta?. 
whether the material to be painted was plaster, stone, marble 
or wood. It was only the damp and frosts of northern climates 
that to some extent limited the external use of colour to the less 
exposed parts of the outsides of buildings. The varying tints 
and texture of smoothly worked stone appear to have given no 
pleasure to the medieval eye; and in the rare cases in which the 
poverty of some country church prevented its walls from being 
adorned with painted ornaments or pictures the whole surface 
of the stonework inside, .mouldings and carving as well as 
flat wall-spaces, was covered with a thin coat of whitewash. 
Internal rough stonework was invariably concealed by stucco, 
forming a smooth ground for possible future paintings. Un- 
happily a great proportion of mural paintings have been de- 
stroyed, though many in a more or less mutilated state still exist 
in England. It is difficult (and doubly so since the so-called 
" restoration " of most old buildings) to realize the splendour 
of effect once possessed by every important medieval church. 
From the tiled floor to the roof all was one mass of gold and 
colour. The brilliance of the mural paintings and richly 
coloured sculpture and mouldings was in harmony with the 
splendour of the oak-work — screens, stalls, and roofs — all 
decorated with gilding and painting, while the light, passing 
through stained glass, softened and helped to combine 
the whole into one mass of decorative effect. Colour was 
boldly applied everywhere, and thus the patchy effect was 
avoided which is so often the result of the modern timid and 
partial use of painted ornament. Even the figure-sculpture 
was painted in a strong and realistic manner, sometimes by a 
wax encaustic process, probably the same as the circumlitio 
of classical times. In the accounts for expenses in decorating 
Orvieto cathedral wax is a frequent item among the materials 
used for painting. In one place it is mentioned that wax was 
supplied to Andrea Pisano (in 1345) for the decoration of the 
beautiful reliefs in white marble on the lower part of the west 
front. 

From the nth to the 16th century the lower part of the walls, 
generally 6 to 8 ft. from the floor, was painted with a dado — 
the favourite patterns till the 13th century being either a sort 
of sham masonry with a flower in each rectangular space 
(fig. 9), or a conventional representation of a curtain with

have figures to a larger scale.

On the east wall of the nave over the chancel arch there was 
generally a large painting of the " Doom " or Last Judgment. 
One of the commonest subjects is a colossal figure of St Chris-

entrance — selected because the sight of a picture of this saint 
was supposed to bring good luck for the rest of the day. Figures 
were also often painted on the jambs of the windows and on the 
piers and soffit of the arches, especially that opening into the 
chancel. 

The little Norman church at Kempley in Gloucestershire (date 
about 1100) has perhaps the best-preserved specimen of the com- 
plete early decoration of a chancel. 1 The north and south walls' 
are occupied by figures of the twelve apostles in architectural 
niches, six on each side. Theeast wall had single figures of saints 
at the sides of the central window, and the stone barrel vault is 
covered with a representation of St John's^ apocalyptic vision — 
Christ in majesty surrounded by the evangelistic beasts, the seven 
candlesticks and other figures. The chancel arch itself and the 
jambs and mouldings of the windows have stiff geometrical designs, 
and over the arch, towards the nave, is a large picture of the 
" Doom." The whole scheme is very complete, no part of the 
internal plaster or stonework being undeco rated with colour. 
Though the drawing is rude, the figures and their drapery are 
treated broadly and with dignity. Simple earth colours are used, 
painted in tempera on a plain white ground, which covers alike 
both the plaster of the rough walls and the smooth stone of the 
arches and jambs. 

In the 13th century the painters of England reached a high 
point of artistic power and technical skill, so that paintings were 
produced by native artists equal, if not superior, to those of 
the same period anywhere on the Continent. The central 
paintings on the walls of the chapter-house and on the retable 
of the high altar of Westminster Abbey are not surpassed by

any of the smaller works even of such men as Cimabue and Duccio 
di Buoninsegna, who were living when these Westminster 
paintings were executed. Unhappily, partly through the 
poverty and anarchy brought about hy the French wars and 
the Wars of the Roses, the development of art in England made 
little progress after the beginning of the 14th century, and it

was not till a time when the renaissance of art in Italy had fallen 
into decay that its influence reached the British shores. In 
the 15th century some beautiful work, somewhat affected by 
Flemish influence, was produced in England (fig. 11), chiefly 
in the form of figures painted on the oak panels of chancel 
and chapel screens, especially in Norfolk and Suffolk; but these 
cannot be said to rival the works of the Van Eycks and other 
painters of that time in Flanders. To return to the 13th 
century, the culminating period of English art in painting and 
sculpture, much was owed to Henry III.'s love for and patronage 
of the fine arts; he employed a large number of painters to 
decorate his various castles and palaces, especially the palace of 
Westminster, one large hall of which was known as the " painted

chamber " from the ro*vs of fine pictures with which its walls 
were covered. After the 13th century the " masonry pattern " 
was disused for the lower parts of walls, and the chevrony and 
other stiff patterns for the borders were replaced by more flowing 
designs. The character of the painted figures became less 
monumental in style; greater freedom of drawing and treatment 
was adopted, and they cease to recall the archaic majesty and 
grandeur of the Byzantine mosaics. 

It may be noted that during the 14th century wall-spaces 
unoccupied by figure-subjects were often covered by graceful 
flowing patterns, drawn with great 
freedom and rather avoiding geo- 
metrical repetition. Fig. 12, from 
the church of Stanley St Leonard's, 
Gloucestershire, is a good character- 
istic specimen of 14th-century decora- 
tion; it is on the walls of the chancel, 
filling up the spaces between the 
painted figures; the flowers are blue, 
and the lines red on a white ground. 
In some cases the motive of the 
design is taken from encaustic tiles, 
as at Bengeo Church, Herts, where 
the wall is divided into squares, each 
containing an heraldic lion. This 
imitative notion occurs during all periods — masonry, hanging 
curtains, tiles and architectural features such as niches and 
canopies being very frequently represented, though always 
in a simple decorative fashion with no attempt at actual 
deception — not probably from any fixed principle that shams 
were wrong, but because the good taste of the medieval 
painters taught them that a flat unrealistic treatment gave 
the best and most decorative effect. Thus in the 15th and 
1 6th centuries the commonest forms of unpictorial wall- 
decoration were various patterns taken from the beautiful 
damasks and cut velvets of Sicily, Florence, Genoa and other 
places in Italy, some form of the " pine-apple " or rather " arti- 
choke " pattern being the favourite (fig. 13), a design which,

developed partly from Oriental sources, and coming to perfection 
at the end of the 15th century, was copied and reproduced in 
textiles, printed stuffs and wall-papers with but little change 
down to the present century — a remarkable instance of survival 
in design. Fig. 14 is a specimen of 15th-century English decora- 
tive painting, copied from a 14th-century Sicilian silk damask. 
Diapers, powdcrings with flowers, . sacred monograms and 
sprays of blossom were frequently used to ornament large 
surfaces in a simple way. Many of these are extremely beautiful 
(fig. 15). 



Subjects of Medieval Wall-Paintings. — In churches and domestic 
buildings alike the usual subjects represented on the walls were 
specially selected for their moral and religious teaching, either

stories from the Bible and Apocrypha, or from the lives of saints, 

or, lastly, symbolical representations setting forth some important 

theological truth, such as figures of virtues and vices, or the Scala 

humanae salyationis, showing the, perils and temptations of the 

human soul in its struggle to escape hell £nd gain paradise — a rude 

foreshadowing of the great scheme worked out with such perfection 

by Dante in his Commedia. A fine example of this subject exists 

on the walls of" Chaldon church, Surrey. 1 In the selection of saints 

for paintings in England, 

those of English origin are 

naturally most frequently 

represented, and different 

districts had certain local 

favourites. St Thomas of 

Canterbury was one of the 

most widely popular; but 

few examples now remain, 

owing to Henry VIII.'s 

special dislike to this saint 

and the strict orders that 

were issued for all pictures 

of him to be destroyed. 

For a similar reason most 

paintings of saintly popes 

were obliterated. 

Methods of Execution. — 
Though Eraclius, who 
probably wrote before the 
10th century, mentions 
the use of an oil-medium, 
yet till about the 13th 
century mural paintings 
appear to have been exe- 
cuted in the most simple FlG I5 ._p wderings used in 15th- 
way, in tempera mainly century Wall-Painting. 

with earth colours applied 

on dry stucco; even when a smooth stone surface was^ to be 
painted a thin coat of whitening or fine gesso was laid as a 
ground. In the 13th century, and perhaps earlier, oil was com- 
monly used both as a medium for the pigments and also to make 
a varnish to cover and fix tempera paintings. The Van Eycks 
introduced the use of dryers of a better kind than had yet been 
used, and so largely extended the application of oil-painting. 
Before their time it seems to have been the custom to dry wall- 
paintings laboriously by the use of charcoal braziers, if they were 
in a position where the sun could not shine upon them. This is

specially recorded in the valuable series of accounts for the expenses 
of wall-paintings in the royal palace of Westminster during the 
reign of Henry III., printed in Vetusta monumenta, vol. vi. (1842). 
All the materials used, including charcoal to dry the paintings and 
the wages paid to the artists, are given. The materials mentioned 
are plumbum album et rubeum, viridus, vermilio, synople t ocre, 
azura, aurum, argentum, collis, oleum, vernix. 

Two foreign painters were employed — Peter of Spain and William 
of Florence — at sixpence a day, but the English painters seem to

have done most of the work and received _ higher pay. William, 
an English monk in the adjoining Benedictine abbey of West- 
minster, received two shillings ^a day. Walter of Durham and 
various members of the Otho family, royal goldsmiths and moneyers, 
worked for many years on the adornment of Henry III.'s palace 
and were well paid for their skill. Some fragments of paintings 
from the royal chapel of St Stephen are now in the British 
Museum. They are delicate and carefully^ painted subjects from 
the Old Testament, in rich colours, each with explanatory inscrip- 
tion underneath. The scale is small, the figures being scarcely 
a foot high. Their method of execution is curious.^ First the 
smooth stone wall was covered with a coat of red, painted in oil, 
probably to keep back the damp; on that a thin skin of fine gesso 
(stucco) has been applied, and the outlines of the figures marked 
with a point; the whole of the background, crowns, borders of 
dresses, and other ornamental parts have then been modelled and 
stamped with very minute patterns in slight relief, impressed on 
the surface of the gesso while it was yet soft. The figures have then 
been painted, apparently in tempera, gold leaf has been applied 
to the stamped reliefs, and the whole has been covered with an oil 
varnish. It is difficult to realize the labour required to cover large 
halls such as the above chapel and the " painted chamber," the 
latter about 83 ft. by 27 ft., with this style of decoration. 

In many cases the grounds were entirely covered with shining 
.metal leaf, over which the paintings were executed; those parts, 
such as the draperies, where the metallic lustre was wanted, were 
painted in oil with transparent colours, while the flesh was painted 
in opaque tempera. The effect of the bright metal shining through 
the rich colouring is magnificent. This minuteness of much of the 
medieval wall-decoration is remarkable. Large wall-surfaces and 
intricate mouldings were often completely covered by elaborate 
gesso patterns in relief of almost microscopic delicacy (fig. 16). 
The cost of stamps for this is among the items in the Westminster 
accounts. These patterns when set and dry were further adorned 
with gold and colours. So also with the architectural painting; 
the artist was not content simply to pick out the various members 
of the mouldings in different colours, but he also frequently covered 
each bead or fillet with painted flowers and other patterns, as 
delicate as those in an illuminated MS. — so minute and highly- 
finished that they are almost invisible at a little distance, but yet 
add greatly to the general richness of effect. t All this is neglected 
in modern reproductions of medieval painting, in which both 
touch and colour are coarse and harsh — caricatures of the old 
work, such as disfigure the Sainte Chapelle in Paris, and many 
cathedrals in France, Germany and England. Gold was never 
used in large quantities without the ground on which it was laid 



being broken up by some such delicate reliefs as that shown ir» 
fig. 16, so its effect was never dazzling. (W. Mo.; J. H. M.) 

Mural painting in England fell into disuse in the 16th century, 
until attempts to revive it were made in the 19th century. 
For domestic purposes wood panelling, stamped leather, and 
tapestry were chiefly used as wall-coverings. In the reign of 
Henry VIII., probably in part through Holbein's influence, a 
rather coarse tempera wall-painting, German in style, appears 
to have been common. 1 A good example of arabesque painting 
of this period in black and white, rudely though boldly drawn 
and Holbeinesque in character, was discovered in 1881 behind the 
panelling in one of the canons' houses at Westminster. Other 
examples exist at Haddon Hall (Derbyshire) and elsewhere. 

Many efforts have been made in England to revive fresco 
painting. The Houses of Parliament bear witness to this, the 
principal works there being those of William Dyce and Daniel 
Maclise. That of G. F. Watts, whose easel work also is generally 
distinguished by its mural feeling, is full of serious purpose and 
dignity of conception. " Buono fresco " (the painting in tempera 
upon a freshly laid ground of plaster while wet), " spirit fresco " 
or Gambier-Parry method (the painting with a spirit medium 
upon a specially prepared plaster or canvas ground 2 ), and "water- 
glass " painting (wherein the method is similar to water-colour 
painting on a prepared plastered wall, the painting when finished 
being covered with a chemical solution which hardens and 
protects the surface), have all been tried. Other processes are 
also in the experimental stage, such as that known as Keim's, • 
which has been successfully tried by Mrs Merritt in a series of 
mural paintings in a church at Chil worth. Unless, however , 
some means can be found of enabling the actual painted wall 
to resist the natural dampness of the English climate, it does not 
seem likely that true fresco painting can ever be naturalized in 
Great Britain. Of two of the few modern artists entrusted 
with important mural work in England, Ford Madox Brown 
and Frederick J. Shields, the former distinguished especially for 
his fine series of mural paintings in the Manchester town-hall, in 
the later paintings there adopted the modern method of painting 
the design upon canvas in flat oil colour, using a wax medium, 
and afterwards affixing the canvas to the wall by means of white 
lead. This is a usual method with modern decorators. Mr 
Shields has painted the panels of his scheme of mural decoration 
in the chapel of the Ascension at Bays water, London, also 
upon canvas in oils, and has adopted the method of fixing them 
to slabs of slate facing the wall so as to avoid the risk of damp 
from the wall itself. Friezes and frieze panels or ceilings in 
private houses are usually painted upon canvas in oil and affixed 
to the wall or inserted upon their strainers, like pictures in a 
frame. (Walter Crane has used fibrous plaster panels, painting in 
ordinary oil colours with turpentine as a medium, as in Redcross 
Hall.) Recently there has been a revival of tempera painting, 
and a group of painters are producing works on panel and canvas 
painted in tempera or fresco secco, with yolk of egg as a medium, 
according to the practice of the early Italian painters and the 
directions of Cennino Cennini. A pure luminous quality of 
colour is produced, valuable in mural decoration and also 
durable, especially under varnish. (W. Cr.)

about 1 m. north of Venice. It is 5 m. in circumference, 
and a large part of it is occupied by gardens. It contained 5436 
inhabitants in 1901, but was once much more populous than 
it is at present, its inhabitants numbering 30,000. It was a 
favourite resort of the Venetian nobility before they began to 
build their villas on the mainland; Und in the 15th and 16th 
centuries its gardens and casinos, of which some traces remain, 
were famous. It was here that the literary clubs of the Vigilanti, 
the Studiosi and the Occulti, used to meet.

The town is built upon one broad main canal, where the 
tidal current runs with great force, and upon several smaller 
ones. The cathedral, S. Donato, is a fine basilica, of the 12th 
century. The pavement (of mi) is as richly inlaid as that of 
St Mark's, and the mosaics of the tribune are remarkable. The 
■exterior of the tribune is beautiful, and has been successfully 
restored. The church of St Peter the Martyr (1509) contains a 
fine picture by Gentile Bellini and other works, and S. Maria degli 
Angeli also contains several interesting pictures. Murano has 
from ancient times been celebrated for its glass manufactories. 
When and how the art was introduced is obscure, but there 
are notices of it as early as the nth century; and in 1250 Christo- 
foro Briani attempted the imitation of agate and chalcedony. 
From the labours of his pupil Miotto sprang that branch of 
the glass trade which is concerned with the imitation of gems. 
In the 15th century the first crystals were made, and in the 
17th the various gradations of coloured and iridescent glass 
were invented, together with the composition called " aventu- 
rine "; the manufacture of beads is now a main branch of the 
trade. The art of the glass-workers was taken under the 
protection of the Government in 1275, and regulated by a special 
code of laws and privileges; two fairs were held annually, and 
the export of all materials, such as alum and sand, which enter 
into the composition of glass was absolutely forbidden. With 
the decay of Venice the importance of the Murano glass-works 
declined; but A. Salviati (1816-1890) rediscovered many of the 
■old processes, and eight firms are engaged in the trade, the 
most renowed being the Venezia Murano Company and Salviati. 
The municipal museum contains a collection of glass illustrating 
the history and progress of the art. 

The island of Murano was first peopled by the inhabitants 
■of Altino. It originally enjoyed independence under the rule 
■of its tribunes and judges, and was one of the twelve confederate 
islands of the lagoons. In the 12th century the doge Vital 
Micheli II. incorporated Murano in Venice and attached it to 
the Sestiere of S. Croce. From that date it was governed by 
a Venetian nobleman with the title of podestd whose office 
lasted sixteen months. Murano, however, retained its original 
constitution of a greater and a lesser council for the transaction 
of municipal business, and also the right to coin gold and silver 
as well as its judicial powers. The interests of the town 
were watched at the ducal palace by a nuncio and a solicitor; 
and this constitution remained in force till the fall of the 
republic.

MURAT, JOACHIM (1767-1815), king of Naples, younger 
son of an innkeeper at La Bastide-Fortuniere in the department 
of Lot, France, was born on the 25th of March 1767. Destined 
for the priesthood, he obtained a bursary at the college of Cahors, 
proceeding afterwards to the university of Toulouse, where 
he studied canon law. His vocation, however, was certainly 
not sacerdotal, and after dissipating his money he enlisted in a 
cavalry regiment. In 1789 he had attained the rank of marichal 
des logis, but in 1790 he was dismissed the regiment for in- 
subordination. After a period of idleness, he was enrolled, 
through the good offices of J. B. Cavaignac, in the new Constitu- 
tional Guard of Louis XVI. (1791). In Paris he gained a reputa- 
tion for his good looks, his swaggering attitude, and the violence 
of his revolutionary sentiments. On the 30th of May 1792, the 
guard having been disbanded, he was appointed sub-lieutenant 
in the 21st Chasseurs a cheval, with which regiment he served 
in the Argonne and the Pyrenees, obtaining in the latter campaign 

Jthe command of a squadron. After the 9th Thermidor, however, 
and the proscription of the Jacobins, with whom he had 



conspicuously identified himself, he fell under suspicion and 
was recalled from the front. 

Returning to Paris (1795), he made the acquaintance of 
Napoleon Bonaparte, another young officer out of employment, 
who soon gained a complete ascendancy over his vain, ambitious 
and unstable nature. On the 13th Vendemiaire, when Bonaparte, 
commissioned by Barras, beat down with cannon the armed 
insurrection of the Paris sections against the Convention, Murat 
was his most active and courageous lieutenant, and was rewarded 
by the lieutenant-colonelcy of the 21st Chasseurs and the appoint- 
ment of first aide de camp to General Bonaparte in Italy. In 
the first battles of the famous campaign of 1796 Murat so 
distinguished himself that he was chosen to carry the captured 
flags to Paris. He was promoted to be general of brigade, and 
returned to Italy in time to be of essential service to Bonaparte 
at Bassano, Corona and Fort St Giorgio, where he was wounded. 
He was then sent on a diplomatic mission to Genoa, but returned 
in time to be present at Rivoli. In the advance into Tirol in 
the summer of 1797 he commanded the vanguard, and by his 
passage of the Tagliamento hurried on the preliminaries of 
Leoben. In 1798 he was for a short time commandant at Rome, 
and then accompanied Bonaparte to Egypt. At the battle 
of the Pyramids he led his first famous cavalry charge, and so 
distinguished himself in Syria that he was made general of 
division (October, 1 799). He returned to France with Bonaparte, 
and on the 18th Brumaire led into the orangery of Saint Cloud 
the sixty grenadiers whese appearance broke up the Council 
of Five Hundred. After the success of the coup d y Uai he was 
made commandant of the consular guard, and on the 20th of 
January 1800 he married Caroline Bonaparte, youngest sister 
of the first consul. He commanded the French cavalry at 
the battle of Marengo, and was afterwards made governor in 
the Cisalpine Republic. As commander of the army of observa- 
tion in Tuscany he forced the Neapolitans to evacuate the Papal 
States and to accept the treaty of Florence (March 28, 1801). 
In January 1804 he was given the post of governor of Paris, 
and in this capacity appointed the military commission by which 
the due d'Enghien was tried and shot (March 20); in May he was 
made marshal of the empire; in February 1805 he was made 
grand admiral, with the title of prince, and invested with the 
grand eagle of the Legion of Honour. He commanded the 
cavalry of the Grand Army in the German campaign of 1805, 
and was sc conspicuous at Austerlitz that Napoleon made him 
grand duke of Berg and CI eves (March 15, 1806). He com- 
manded the cavalry at Jena, Eylau, and Friedland, and in 
1808 was made general-in-chief of the French aimics in Spain. 
He entered Madrid on the 25th of March, and on the 2nd of 
May suppressed an insurrection in the city. He did much to 
prepare the events which ended in the abdication of Charles IV. 
and Ferdinand VII. at Bayonne; but the hopes he had cherished 
of himself receiving the crown of Spain were disappointed. On 
the 1st of August, however, he was appointed by Napoleon to 
the throne of Naples, vacated by the transference of Joseph 
Bonaparte to Spain. 

King Joachim Napoleon, as he styled himself, entered Naples 
in September, his handsome presence and open manner gaining 
him instantaneous popularity. Almost his first act as king 
was to attack Capri, which he wrested from the British; but, 
this done, he returned to Naples and devoted himself to establish- 
ing his kingship according to his ideas, a characteristic blend 
of the vulgarity of a jKirventi with the essential principles of 
the Revolution. He dazzled the lazzaroni with* the extravagant 
splendour of his costumes; he set up a sumptuous court, created 
a new nobility, nominated marshals. With an eye to the over- 
throw of his legitimate rival in Sicily, he organized a large army 
and even a fleet; but he also swept away the last relics of the 
effete feudal system and took efficient measures for suppressing 
brigandage. From the first his relations with Napoleon were 
strained. The emperor upbraided him sarcastically for his 
" monkey tricks " (singeries) ; Murat ascribed to the deliberate 
ill-will of the French generals who served with him, and even to 
Napoleon, the failure of his attack on Sicily in 1810. He resented 



28 



MURAT 



his subordination to the emperor, and early began his pose as an 
Italian king by demanding the withdrawal of the French troops 
from Naples and naturalization as Neapolitans of all Frenchmen 
in the service of the state (1811). Napoleon, of course, met this 
demand with a curt refusal. A breach between the brothers- 
in-law was only averted by the Russian campaign of 181 2 and 
Napoleon's invitation to Murat to take command of the cavalry 
in the Grand Army. This was a call which appealed to all 
his strongest military instincts, and he obeyed it. During the 
disastrous retreat he showed his usual headstrong courage; but 
in the middle of December he suddenly threw up his command 
and returned to Naples. The reason of this was the suspicion, 
which had been growing on him for two years past, that Napoleon 
was preparing for him the fate of the king of Holland, and that 
his own wife, Queen Caroline, was plotting with the emperor 
for his dethronement. To Marshal Davout, who pointed out to 
him that he was only king of Naples " by grace of the emperor 
and the blood of Frenchmen," he replied that he was king of 
Naples as the emperor of. Austria was emperor of Austria, and 
that he could do as he liked. He was, in fact, already dreaming 
of exchanging his position of a vassal king of the French Empire 
for that of a national Italian king. In the enthusiastic reception 
that awaited him on his return to Naples on the 4th of February 
there was nothing to dispel these illusions. All the Italian 
parties flocked round him, flattering and cajoling him: the 
patriots, because he seemed to them loyal and glorious enough 
to assume the task of Italian unification; the partisans of the dis- 
possessed princes, because they looked upon him as a convenient 
instrument and as simple enough to be made an easy dupe. 

From this moment dates the importance of Murat in the 
history of Europe during the next few years. He at once, 
without consulting his minister of foreign affairs, despatched 
Prince Cariati on a confidential mission to Vienna; if Austria 
would secure the renunciation of his rights by King Ferdinand 
and guarantee the possession of the kingdom of Naples to himself, 
he would place his army at her disposal and give up his claims 
to Sicily. Austria herself, however, had not as yet broken 
definitively with Napoleon, and before she openly joined the 
Grand Alliance, after the illusory congress of Prague, many 
things had happened to make Murat change his mind. He was 
offended by Napoleon's bitter letters and by tales of his slighting 
comments on himself; he was alarmed by the emperor's scarcely 
veiled threats; but after all he was a child of the Revolution 
and a born soldier, with all the soldier's instinct of loyalty to 
a great leader, and he grasped eagerly at any excuse for believing 
that Napoleon, in the event of victory, would maintain him 
on his throne. Then came the emperor's advance into Germany, 
supported as yet by his allies of the Rhenish Confederation. 
On the fatal field of Leipzig Murat once more fought on Napo- 
leon's side, leading the French squadrons with all his old valour 
and dash. But this crowning catastrophe was too much for 
his wavering faith. On the evening of the 16th of October, 
the first day of the battle, Metternich found means to open a 
separate negotiation with him: Great Britain and Austria 
would, in the event of Murat's withdrawal from Napoleon's 
army and refusal to send reinforcements to the viceroy of Italy, 
secure the cession to him of Naples by King Ferdinand, guarantee 
him in its possession, and obtain for him further advantages 
in Italy. To accept the Austrian advances seemed now his 
only chance of continuing to be a king. At Erfurt he asked 
and obtained the emperor's leave to return to Naples; " our 
adieux," he said, " were not over-cordial." 

He reached Naples on the 4th of November and at once 
informed the Austrian envoy of his wish to join the Allies, 
suggesting that the Papal States, with the exception of Rome 
and the surrounding district, should be made over to him as 
his reward. On the 31st of December Count Neipperg, after- 
wards the lover of the empress Marie Louise, arrived at Naples 
with powers to treat. The result was the signature, on the nth 
of January 1814, of a treaty by which Austria guaranteed to 
Murat the throne of Naples and promised her good offices to 
secure the assent of the other Allies. Secret additional articles 



stipulated that Austria would use her good offices to secure the 
renunciation by Ferdinand of his rights to Naples, in return 
for an indemnity to hasten the conclusion of peace between 
Naples and Great Britain, and to augment the Neapolitan 
kingdom by territory embracing 400,000 souls at the expense 
of the states of the Church. 

The project of the treaty having been communicated to 
Castlereagh, he replied by expressing the willingness of the 
British government to conclude an armistice with " the person 
exercising the government of Naples " (Jan. 22), and this was 
accordingly signed on the 3rd of February by Bentinck. It 
was clear that Great Britain had no intention of ultimately 
recognizing Murat's right to reign. As for Austria, she would 
be certain that Murat's own folly would, sooner or later, give 
her an opportunity for repudiating her engagements. For the 
present the Neapolitan alliance would be invaluable to the Allies 
for the purpose of putting an end to the French dominion in 
Italy. The plot was all but spoilt by the prince royal of Sicily, 
who in an order of the day announced to his soldiers that their 
legitimate sovereign had not renounced his rights to the throne 
of Naples (Feb. 20); from the Austrian point of view it was 
compromised by a proclamation issued by Bentinck at Leghorn 
on the 14th of March, in which he called on the Italians to rise 
in support of the " great cause of their fatherland." From 
Dijon Castlereagh promptly wrote to Bentinck (April 3) to say 
that the proclamation of the prince of Sicily must be disavowed, 
and that if King Ferdinand did not behave properly Great 
Britain would recognize* Murat's title. A letter from Metternich 
to Marshal Bellegarde, of the same place and date, insisted 
that Bentinck's operations must be altered; the last thing that 
Austria desired was an Italian national rising. 

It was, indeed, by this time clear to the allied powers that 
Murat's ambition had o'erleaped the bounds set for them. 
" Murat, a true son of the Revolution," wrote Metternich, 
in the same letter, " did not hesitate to form projects of con- 
quest when all his care should have been limited to simple 
calculations as to how to preserve his throne. . . . He dreamed 
of a partition of Italy between him and us. . . . When w T e refused 
to annex all Italy north of the Po, he saw* that his calculations 
were wrong, but refused to abandon his ambitions. His attitude 
is most suspicious." " Press the restoration of the grand-duke 
in Tuscany," wrote Castlereagh to Bentinck; " this is the true 
touchstone of Murat's intentions. We must not suffer him to 
carry out his plan of extended dominion; but neither must 
we break with him and so abandon Austria to his augmented 
intrigues." 

Meanwhile, Murat had formally broken with Napoleon, and 
on the 1 6th of January the French envoy quitted Naples. But 
the treason by which he hoped to save his throne was to make 
its loss inevitable. He had betrayed Napoleon, only to be made 
the cat's-paw of the Allies. Great Britain, even when con- 
descending to negotiate with him, had never recognized his 
title; she could afford to humour Austria by holding out hopes of 
ultimate recognition, in order to detach him from Napoleon; for 
Austria alone of the Allies was committed to him, and Castle- 
reagh well knew that, when occasion should arise, her obliga- 
tions would not be suffered to hamper her interests. With the 
downfall of Napoleon Murat's defection had served its turn; 
moreover, his equivocal conduct during the campaign in Italy 1 
had blunted the edge of whatever gratitude the powers may 
have been disposed to feel; his ambition to unite all Italy south 
of the Po under his crown was manifest, and the statesmen 
responsible for the re-establishment of European order were 
little likely to do violence to their legitimist principles in order 
to maintain on his throne a revolutionary sovereign who was 
proving himself so potent a centre of national unrest. 

At the very opening of the congress of Vienna Talleyrand, 
with astounding effrontery, affected not to know " the man " 

1 He had contributed to the defeats of the viceroy Prince Eugene 
in January and February 1814, but did not show any eagerness to 
press his victories to the advantage of the Allies, contenting himself 
with occupying the principality of Benevcnto.

who had been casually referred to as " the king of Naples "; 
and he made it the prime object of his policy in the weeks that 
followed to secure the repudiation by the powers of Mu rat's 
title, and the restoration of the Bourbon king. The powers, 
indeed, were very ready to accept at least the principle of this 
policy. " Great Britain," wrote Castlereagh to Lord Liverpool 
on the 3rd of September from Geneva, " has no objection, but 
the reverse, to the restoration of the Bourbons in Naples." 1 
Prussia saw in Murat the protector of the malcontents in Italy. 2 
Alexander I. of Russia had no sympathy for any champion of 
Liberalism in Italy save himself. Austria confessed " sub 
sigillo " that she shared " His Most Christian Majesty's views 
as to the restoration of ancient dynasties." 3 The main difficul- 
ties in the way were Austria's treaty obligations and the means 
by which the desired result was to be ohtained. 

Talleyrand knew well that Austria, in the long run, would 
break faith with Murat and prefer a docile Bourbon on the throne 
of Naples to this incalculable child of the Revolution; but he 
had his private reasons for desiring to " score off " Metternich, 
the continuance of whose quasidiplomatic liaison with Caroline 
Murat he rightly suspected. He proposed boldly that, since 
Austria, in view of the treaty of Jan. 11, 1814, was naturally 
reluctant to undertake the task, the restored Bourbon king 
of France should be empowered to restore the Bourbon king of 
Naples by French arms, thus reviving once more the ancient 
Habsburg-Bourbon rivalry for dominion in Italy. 4 

Metternich, with characteristic skill, took advantage of this 
situation at once to checkmate France and td disembarrass 
Austria of its obligations to Murat. While secretly assuring 
Louis XVIII., through his confidant Blacas, that Austria was 
in favour of a Bourbon restoration in Naples, he formally 
intimated to Talleyrand that a French invasion of Italian soil 
would mean war with Austria. 6 To Murat, who had appealed 
to the treaty of 1814, and demanded a passage northward for 
the troops destined to oppose those of Louis X VTIL, he explained 
that Austria, by her ultimatum to France, had already done all 
that was necessary, that any movement of the Neapolitan 
troops outside Naples would be a useless hreach of the peace 
of Italy, and that it would be regarded as an attack on Austria 
and a rupture of the alliance. Murat's suspicions of Austrian 
sincerity were now confirmed; 6 he realized that there was no 
question now of his obtaining any extension of territory at the 
expense of the states of the Church, and that in the Italy as 
reconstructed at Vienna his own position would be intolerable. 
Thus the very motives which had led him to betray Napoleon 
now led him to break with Austria. He would secure his throne 
by proclaiming the cause of united Italy, chasing the Austrians

which would thus become infected with revolutionary views? .... 
The emperor could not allow such an expedition, when Italy is

* That they were fully justified is clear from the following ex- 
tract from a letter of Metternich to Bombelles at Paris (dated 
Vienna, Jan. 13, 1815). "Whether Joachim or a Bourbon reigns 
at Naples is for us a very subordinate question. . . . When Europe 
is established on solid foundations the fate of Joachim will no longer 
be problematical, but do not let us risk destroying Austria and 
France and Europe, in order to solve this question at the worst 
moment it would be put on the tapis. . . . This is no business of 
the Congress, but let the Bourbon Powers declare that they maintain 
their claims." (In Castlereagh^ private letter to Lord Liverpool,

from the peninsula, and establishing himself as a national 
king. 

To contemporary observers in the best position to judge 
the enterprise seemed by no means hopeless. Lord William 
Bentinck, the commander of the English forces in Italy, wrote 
to Castlereagh 7 that, " having seen more of Italy," he doubted 
whether the whole force of Austria would be able to expel Murat; 
" he has said clearly that he will raise the whole of Italy; and 
there is not a doubt that under the standard of Italian indepen- 
dence the whole of Italy will rally." This feeling, continued 
Bentinck, was due to the foolish and illiberal conduct of the 
restored sovereigns; the inhabitants of the states occupied by 
the Austrian troops were " discontented to a man "; even in Tus- 
cany " the same feeling and desire " universally prevailed. All 
the provinces, moreover, were full of unemployed officers and 
soldiers who, in spite of Murat's treason, would rally to his 
standard, especially as he would certainly first put himself into 
communication with Napoleon in Elha; while, so far as Bentinck 
could hear of the disposition of the French army, it would be 
" dangerous to assemble it anywhere or for any purpose." The 
urgency of the danger was, then, fully realized by the powers 
even before Napoleon's return from Elba; for they were well 
aware of Murat's correspondence with him. On the first news 
of Napoleon's landing in France, the British government wrote 
to Wellington 8 that this event together with "the proofs of 
Murat's treachery " had removed " all remaining scruples " on 
their part, and that they were now " prepared to enter into a 
concert for his removal," adding that Murat should, in the event 
of his resigning peaceably, receive " a pension and all considera- 
tion." The rapid triumph of Napoleon, however, altered this 
tone. " Bonaparte's successes have altered the situation," wrote 
Castlereagh to Wellington on the 24th, adding that Great Britain 
would enter into a treaty with Murat, if he would give guarantees 
" by a certain redistribution of his forces " and the like, and 
that in spite of Napoleon's success he would be " true to Europe." 
In a private letter enclosed Castlereagh suggested that Murat 
might send an auxiliary force to France, where " his personal 
presence would be unseemly." 9 

Clearly, had King Joachim played his cards well he had the 
game in his hands. But it was not in his nature to play them 
well. He should have made the most of the chastened temper 
of the Allies, either to secure favourable terms from them, or 
to hold them in play until Napoleon was ready to take the field. 
But his head had been turned by the flatteries of the " patriots"; 
he believed that all Italy would rally to his cause, and that alone 
he would be able to drive the " Germans " over the Alps, and 
thus, as king of united Italy, he in a position to treat on equal 
terms with Napoleon, should he prove victorious; and he 
determined to strike without delay. On the 23rd the news 
reached Metternich at Vienna that the Neapolitan troops were 
on the march to the frontier. The Allies at once decided to 
commission Austria to deal with Murat; in the event of whose 
defeat, Ferdinand IV. was to be restored to Naples, on promising 
a general amnesty and giving guarantees for a " reasonable " 
system of government. 10 

Meanwhile, in Naples itself there were signs enough that 
Murat's popularity had disappeared. In Calabria the indiscrimi- 
nate severity cf General Manhes in suppressing brigandage had 
made the government hated; in the capital the general dis- 
affection had led to rigorous policing, while conscripts had to 
be dragged in chains to join their regiments. 11 In these circum- 
stances an outburst of national enthusiasm for King Joachim 
was hardly to be expected; and the campaign in effect proved a 
complete fiasco. Rome and Bologna were, indeed, occupied with- 
out serious opposition; but on the 12th of April Murat's forces 
received a check from the advancing Austrians at Ferrara and 
on the 2nd of May were completely routed at Tolentino. The

Austrians advanced on Naples, when Ferdinand IV. was duly 
restored, while Queen Caroline and her children were deported to 
Trieste. 

Murat himself escaped to France, where 'his offer of service 
was contemptuously refused by Napoleon. He hid for a 
while near Toulon, with a price upon his head; then, after 
Waterloo, refusing an asylum in England, he set out for Corsica 
(August). Here he was joined by a few rash spirits who urged 
him to attempt to recover his kingdom. Though Metternich 
offered to allow him to join his wife at Trieste and to secure 
him a dignified position and a pension, he preferred to risk 
all on a final throw for power. On the 28th of September he 
sailed for Calabria with a flotilla of six vessels carrying some 
250 armed men. Four of his ships were scattered by a storm; 
one deserted him at the last moment, and on the 8th of October 
he landed at Pizzo with only 30 companions. Of the popular 
enthusiasm for his cause which he had been led to expect there 
was less than no sign, and after a short and unequal contest he 
was taken prisoner by a captain named Trenta-Capilli, whose 
brother had been executed by General Manhes. He was im- 
prisoned in the fort of Pizzo, and on the 13th of October 181 5 
was tried by court-martial, under a law of his own, for disturbing 
the public peace, and was sentenced to be shot in half an hour. 
After writing a touching letter of farewell to his wife and children, 
he bravely met his fate, and was buried at Pizzo, 

Though much good may be said of Murat as a king sincerely 
anxious for the welfare of his adopted country, his most abiding 
title to fame is that of the most dashing cavalry leader of the 
age. As a man he was rash, hot-tempered and impetuously 
brave; he was adored by his troopers who followed their 
idol, the " golden eagle," into the most terrible fire and against 
the most terrible odds. Napoleon lived to regret his refusal 
to accept his services during the Hundred Days, declaring that 
Mu rat's presence at Waterloo would have given more con- 
centrated power to the cavalry charges and might possibly have 
changed defeat into victory. 

By his wife Maria Annunciata Carolina Murat had two sons. 
The elder, Napoleon Achille Murat (1801-1847), during his 
father's reign prince royal of the Two Sicilies, emigrated about 
1821 to America, and settled near Tallahassee, Florida, where 
in 1826-1838 he was postmaster. In 1826 he married a 
great-niece of Washington. He published Lettres d'un citoyen 
des £tats-Unis a un de ses amis d Europe (Paris, 1830); Esquisse 
morale et politique des Ittats-Unis (ibid. 1832); and Exposition des 
principes du gouvernement rSpublicain tel quHl a etS perfectionni en 
Amirique (ibid. 1833). He died in Florida on the 15th of April 
1847. 

The second son, Napoleon Lucien Charles Murat (1803- 
1878), who was created prince of Ponte Corvo in 1813, lived 
with his mother in Austria after 181 5, and in 1824 started to 
join his brother in America, but was shipwrecked on the coast 
of Spain and held for a while a prisoner. Arriving in 1825, 
two years later he married in Baltimore a rich American, 
Georgina Frazer (d.. 1879) ; but her fortune was lost, and for 
some years his wife supported herself and him by keeping a 
girls' school. After several abortive attempts to return to 
France, the revolution of 1848 at last gave him his opportunity. 
He was elected a member of the Constituent Assembly and of 
the Legislative Assembly (1849), was minister plenipotentiary 
at Turin from October 1849 to March 1850, and after the coup 
d'ttat of the 2nd of December 1851 was made a member of the 
consultative commission. On the proclamation of the Empire, 
he was recognized by Napoleon III. as a prince of the blood royal, 
with the title of Prince Murat, and, in addition to the payment 
of 2,000,000 fr. of debts, was given aj> income of 150,000 fr. 
As a member of the Senate he distinguished himself in 1861 
by supporting the. temporal power of the pope, but otherwise 
he played no conspicuous part. The fall of the Empire in Sep- 
tember 1870 involved his retirement into private life. He died 
on the 10th of April 1878, leaving three sons and two daughters. 
(1) Joachim, Prince Murat (1834-1901), in 1854 married Maley 
Berthier, daughter of the Prince de Wagram, who bore him a 



son, Joachim (b. 1856), who succeeded him as head of the family, 
and two daughters, of whom the younger, Anna (b. 1863), 
became the wife of the Austrian minister Count Goluchowski. 

(2) Achille (1847-1895), married Princess Dadian of Mingrelia. 

(3) Louis (b. 185 1), married in 1873 to the widowed Princess 
Eudoxia Orbeliani (nie Somov), was for a time orderly officer 
to Charles XV.' of Sweden. (4) Caroline (b. 1832), married in 
1850 Baron Charles de Chassiron and in 1872 Mr John Garden 
(d. 1885). (5) Anna (b. 1841), married in 1865 Antoine de 
Noailles, due de Mouchy.

MURATORI, LUDOVICO ANTONIO (1672-1750), Italian 
scholar, historian and antiquary, was born of poor parents at 
Vignola in the duchy of Modena on the 21st of October 1672. 
While young he attracted the attention of Father Bacchini, 
the librarian of the du^e of Modena, by whom his literary tastes 
were turned toward historical and antiquarian research. Having 
taken minor orders in 1688, Muratori proceeded to his degree 
of doctor in utroque jure before 1694, was ordained priest in 1695 
and appointed by Count Carlo Borromeo one of the doctors 
of the Ambrosian library at Milan. From manuscripts now 
placed under his charge he made a selection of materials for 
several volumes {Anecdota) i which he published with notes. 
The reputation he acquired was such that the duke of Modena 
offered him the situation of keeper of the public archives of the 
duchy. Muratori hesitated, until the offer of the additional 
post of librarian, on the resignation of Father Bacchini, deter- 
mined him in 1700 to return to Modena. The preparation of 
numerous valuable tracts on the history of Italy during the middle 
ages, and of dissertations and discussions on obscure points 
of historical and antiquarian interest, as well as the publication 
of his various philosophical, theological, legal, poetical and 
other works absorbed the greater part of his time. These 
brought him into communication with the most distinguished 
scholars of Italy, France and Germany. But they also exposed 
him in his later years to envy. His enemies spread abroad 
the rumour that the pope, Benedict XIV., had discovered in his 
writings passages savouring of heresy, even of atheism. Muratori 
appealed to the pope, repudiating the accusation. His Holiness 
assured him of his protection, and, without expressing his 
approbation of the opinions in question of the learned antiquary, 
freed him from the imputations of his enemies. Muratori 
died on the 23rd of January 1750, and was buried with much 
pomp in the church of Santa Maria di Pomposa, in connexion 
with which he had laboured as parish priest for many years. 
His remains were removed in 1774 to the church of St Augustin. 

Muratori is rightly regarded as the " father of Italian history." 
This is due to his great collection, Rerum itolicarum scripiores, 
to which he devoted about fifteen years 1 work (1 723-1738). 
The gathering together and editing some 25 huge folio 
volumes of texts was followed by a series of 75 dissertations 
on medieval Italy (Antiquitates italicae medii aevi, 1738-1742, 6 
vols, folio). To these he added a Novus thesaurus inscriptionum 
(4 vols. , 1 730-1 743) , which was of great importance in the develop- 
ment of epigraphy. Then, anticipating the action of the learned 
societies of the 19th century, he set about a popular treatment 
of the historical sources he had published. These Annali 
d 1 Italia (1 744-1 749) reached 12 volumes, but were imperfect and 
are of little value. In addition to this national enterprise 
(the Scriptores were published by the aid of the Societa palatina 
of Milan) Muratori published Anecdote ex ambrosianae biblio- 
tkecaecodd. (2 vols. 4to, Milan, 1697, 1698; Padua, 1713); 
Anecdote graeca (3 vols. 4to, Padua, 1709); Antichita Estens

In biblical scholarship Muratori is chiefly known as the dis- 
coverer of the so-called Muratorian Canon, the name given to a 
fragment (85 lines) of early Christian literature, which he found 
in 1740, embedded in an 8th-century codex which forms a 
compendium of theological tracts followed by the five early 
Christian creeds. The document contains a list of the books of 
the New Testament, a similar list concerning the Old Testament 
having apparently preceded it. It is in barbarous Latin which 
has probably been translated from original Greek — the language 
prevailing in Christian Rome until c. 200. There is little doubt 
that it was composed in Rome and we may date it about the 
year 190. Lightfoot inclined to Hippolytus as its author. It 
is the earliest document known which enumerates the books in 
order. 

The first line of the fragment is broken and speaks of the 
Gospel of St Mark, but there is no doubt that its compiler 
knew also of St Matthew. Acts is ascribed to St Luke. He 
names thirteen letters of St Paul but says nothing of the Epistle 
to the Hebrews. The alleged letters of Paul to the Laodiceans 
and Alexandrians he rejects, " for gall must not be mixed with 
honey." The two Epistles of Peter and the Epistle of James 
are not referred to, but that of Jude and two of John are accepted. 
He includes the Apocalypse of John and also the Apocalypse 
of Peter. The Shepherd of Hermas he rejects as not of apostolic 
origin, but this test of canonicity is not consistently applied 
for he allows the " Wisdom written by the friends of Solomon in 
his honour." He rejects the writings of the Gnostics Valentinus 
and Basilides, and of Montanus. 

The list is not an authoritative decree, but a private register 
of what the author considers the prevailing Christian sentiment 
in his neighbourhood. He notes certain differences among 
the Gospels, because not all the evangelists were eye-witnesses 
of the life of Jesus; yet Mark and Luke respectively have behind 
them the authority of Peter and of Paul, who is thus regarded 
as on a footing with the Twelve. The Fourth Gospel was 
written by John at the request of the other apostles and the 
bishops on the basis of a revelation made to Andrew. The 
letters of Paul are written to four individuals and to seven 
different churches, like the seven letters in the Apocalypse of 
John. 

It is interesting to notice the coincidence of his list with the 
evidence gained from Tertullian for Africa and from Irenaeus 
for Gaul and indirectly for Asia Minor. Before the year 200 
there was widespread agreement in the sacred body of apostolic 
writings read in Christian churches on the Lord's Day along with" 
the Old Testament. 

Mura tori's Letters, with a Life prefixed, were published by Lazzari, 
(2 vols., Venice, 1783). His nephew, F. G. Muratori, also wrote 
a Vita del celebre Ludov. Ant. Muratori (Venice, 1756). See also

in full with a translation in H. M. Gwat kin's Selections frotn Early 
Christian Writers. It is also published as No. 1 of H. Lietzmann's

MURAVIEV, MICHAEL NIKOLAIEVICH, Count (1845-1900), 
Russian statesman, was born on the 19th of April 1845. He 
was the son of General Count Nicholas Muraviev" (governor of 
Grodno), and grandson of the Count Michael Muraviev, who 
became notorious for his drastic measures in stamping out the 
Polish insurrection of 1863 in the Lithuanian provinces. He was 
educated at a secondary school at Poltava, and was for a short 
time at Heidelberg University. In 1864 he entered the chancel- 
lery of the minister for foreign affairs at St Petersburg, and was 
soon afterwards attached to the Russian legation at Stuttgart, 
where he attracted the notice of Queen Olga of Wiirttemberg. 
He was transferred to Berlin, then to Stockholm, and back 
again to Berlin. In 1877 he was second secretary at the Hague. 
During the Russo-Turkish War of 1878 he was a delegate of the 
Red Cross Society in charge of an ambulance train provided 



by Queen Olga of Wiirttemberg. After the war he was succes- 
sively first secretary at Paris, chancellor of the embassy at Berlin, 
and then minister at Copenhagen. In Denmark he was brought 
much into contact with the imperial family, and en the death of 
Prince Lobanov in 1897 he was appointed by the Tsar Nicholas II. 
to be his minister of foreign affairs. The next three and a half 
years were a critical time for European diplomacy. The Chinese 
and Cretan questions were disturbing factors. As regards Crete, 
Count Muraviev's policy was vacillating; in China his hands were 
forced by Germany's action at Kiaochow. But he acted with 
singular Uglrett with regard at all events to his assurances to 
Great Britain respecting the leases of Port Arthur and Talienwan 
from China; he told the British ambassador that these would 
be " open ports," and afterwards essentially modified this 
pledge. When the Tsar Nicholas inaugurated the Peace Con- 
ference at the Hague, Count Muraviev extricated his country 
from a situation of some embarrassment ; but when, subsequently, 
Russian * agents in Manchuria and at Peking connived at the 
agitation which culminated in the Boxer rising of 1900, the 
relations of the responsible foreign minister with the tsar became 
strained. Muraviev died suddenly on the 21st of June 1900, 
of apoplexy, brought on, it was said, by a stormy interview 
with the tsar. 

MURCHISON, SIR RODERICK IMPEY (1792-1871), British 
geologist, was born at Tarradale, in eastern Ross, Scotland, on 
the 19th of February 1792. His father, Kenneth Murchison 
(d. 1796), came of an old Highland clan in west Ross-shire, and 
having been educated as a medical man, acquired a fortune in 
India; while still in the prime of life he returned to Scotland, 
where, marrying one of the Mackenzies of Fairburn, he purchased 
the estate of Tarradale and settled for a few years as a resident 
Highland landlord. Young Murchison left the Highlands when 
three years old, and at the age of seven was sent to the grammar 
school of Durham, where he remained for six years. He was then 
placed at the military college, Great Marlow, to be trained for 
the army. With some difficulty he passed the examinations, 
and at the age of fifteen was gazetted ensign in the 36th regiment. 
A year later (1808) he landed with Wellesley in Galicia, and was 
present at the actions of Rorica and Vimiera. Subsequently 
under Sir John Moore he took part in the retreat to Corunna 
and the final battle there. This was his only active service. 
The defeat of Napoleon at Waterloo seeming to close the prospect 
of advancement in the military profession, Murchison, after 
eight years of service, quitted the army, and married the daughter 
of General Hugonin, of Nursted House, Hampshire. With her 
he then spent rather more than two years on the Continent, 
particularly in Italy, where her cultivated tastes were of signal 
influence in guiding his pursuits. He threw himself with all the 
enthusiasm of his character into the study of art and antiquities, 
and for the first time in his life tasted the pleasures of truly 
intellectual pursuits. 

Returning to England in 18 18, he sold his paternal property 
in Ross-shire and settled in England, where he took to field 
sports. He soon became one of the greatest fox-hunters in the 
midland counties; but at last, getting weary of such pursuits and 
meeting Sir Humphry Davy, who urged him to turn his energy 
to science, he was induced to attend lectures at the Royal 
Institution. This change in the current of his occupations 
was much helped by the sympathy of his wife, who, besides her 
artistic acquirements, took much interest in natural history. 
Eager and enthusiastic in whatever he undertook, he was fasci- 
nated by the young science of geology. He joined the Geological 
Society of London and soon showed himself one of its most 
active members, having as his colleagues there such men as 
Sedgwick, W. D. Conybeare, W. Buckland, W. H. Fitton and 
Lyell. Exploring with his wife the geology of the south of 
England, he devoted special attention to the rocks of the north- 
west of Sussex and the adjoining parts of Hants and Surrey, on 
which, aided by Fitton, he wrote his first scientific paper, read 
to the society in 1825. Though he had reached the a.ge of thirty- 
two before he took any interest in science, he developed his 
taste and increased his knowledge so rapidly that in the first

three years of his scientific career he had explored large parts 
of England and Scotland, had obtained materials for three 
important memoirs, as well as for two more written in conjunction 
with Sedgwick, and had risen to be a prominent member of the 
Geological Society and one of its two secretaries. Turning his 
attention for a little to Continental geology, he explored with 
Lyell the volcanic region of Auvergne, parts of southern France, 
northern Italy, Tirol and Switzerland. A little later, with 
Sedgwick as his companion, he attacked the difficult problem 
of the geological structure of the Alps, and their joint paper 
giving the results of their study will always be regarded as one of 
the classics in the literature of Alpine geology. 

It was in the year 1831 that Murcbison found the field in which 
the chief work of his life was to be accomplished. Acting on 
a suggestion made to him by Buckland he betook himself to 
the borders of Wales, with the view of endeavouring to discover 
whether the grcywacke rocks underlying the Old Red Sandstone 
could be grouped into a definite order of succession, as the 
Secondary rocks of England had heen made to tell their story hy 
William Smith. For several years he continued to work vigor- 
ously in that region. The result was the establishment of the 
Silurian system — under which were grouped for the first time a 
remarkable series of formations, each replete with distinctive 
organic remains ol'ir than and very different from those of 
the other rocks of England. These researches, together with 
descriptions of the coal-fields and overlying formations in south 
Wales and the English horder counties, were embodied in The 
Silurian System (London, 1839), a massive quarto in two parts, 
admirahly illustrated with map, sections, pictorial views and 
plates of fossils. The full import of his discoveries was not at 
first perceived; but as years passed on the types of existence 
brought to light by him from the rocks of the border counties 
of England and Wales were ascertained to belong to a geological 
period of which there are recognizable traces in almost all parts 
of the globe. Thus the term " Silurian," derived from the 
name of the old British tribe Silures, soon passed into the 
vocabulary of geologists in every country. 

The establishment of the Silurian system was followed by 
that of the Devonian system, an investigation in which, aided 
by the palaeontological assistance of W. Lonsdale, Sedgwick 
and Murchison were fellow-labourers, hoth in the south-west 
of England and in the Rhineland. Soon afterwards Murchison 
projected an important geological campaign in Russia with the 
view of extending to that part of the Continent the classification 
he had succeeded in elaborating for the older rocks of western 
Europe. He was accompanied hy P. E. ,P. de Verneuil (1805- 
1873) and Count A. F. M. L. A. von Keyserling (1815-1891), in 
conjunction with whom he produced a magnificent work on 
Russia and the Ural Mountains. The publication of this mono- 
graph in 1845 completes the first and most active half of Murchi- 
son's scientific career. In 1846 he was knighted, and in the 
same year he presided over the meeting of the British Association 
at Southampton. During the later years of his life a large part 
of his. time was devoted to the affairs of the Royal Geographical 
Society, of which he was in 1830 one of the founders, and he was 
president 1843-1845, 1851-1853, 1856-1859 and 1862-1871. So 
constant and active were his exertions on behalf of geographical 
exploration that to a large section of the contemporary public he 
was known rather as a geographer than a geologist. He particu- 
larly identified himself with the fortunes of David Livingstone 
in Africa, and did much to raise and keep alive the sympathy 
of his fellow-countrymen in the fate of that great explorer. 

The chief geological investigation of the last decade of his life 
was devoted to the Highlands of Scotland, where he believed 
he had succeeded in showing that the vast masses of crystalline 
schists, previously supposed to be part of what used to be termed 
the Primitive formations, were really not older than the Silurian 
period, for that underneath them lay beds of limestone and 
quartzite containing Lower Silurian (Cambrian) fossils. Subse- 
quent research, however, has shown that this infraposition of 
the fossiliferous rocks is not their original place, but has been 
brought about hy a gigantic system of dislocations, whereby 



successive masses of the oldest gneisses have been torn up from 
below and thrust bodily over the younger formations. 

In 1855 Murchison was appointed director-general of the 
geological survey and director of the Royal School of Mines and 
the Museum of Practical Geology in Jermyn Street, London, in 
succession to Sir Henry De la Beche, who had been the first to 
hold these offices. Official routine now occupied much of his 
time, but he found opportunity for the Highland researches 
just alluded to, and also for preparing successive editions of his 
work Siluria (1854, ed. 5, 1872), which was meant to present 
the main features of the original Silurian Sysie?n together with 
a digest of subsequent discoveries, particularly of those which 
showed the extension of the Silurian classification into other 
countries. His official position gave him further opportunity 
for tbe exercise of those social functions for which he had always 
been distinguished, and which a considerable fortune inherited 
from near relatives on his mother's side enabled him to display 
on a greater scale. His house in Belgrave Square was one of the 
great centres where science, art, literature, politics and social 
eminence were brought together in friendly intercourse. In 
1863 he was made a K.C.B., and three years later was raised 
to the dignity of a baronet. The learned societies of his own 
country bestowed their highest rewards upon him: the Royal 
Society gave him the Copley medal, the Geological Society its 
Wollaston medal, and the Royal Society of Edinburgh its 
Brisbane medal. There was hardly a foreign scientific society 
of note which had not his name enrolled among its honorary 
members. Tbe French Academy of Sciences awarded him the 
prix Cuvier, and elected him one of its eight foreign members in 
succession to Faraday. 

One of the closing public acts of Murchison's life was the 
founding of a chair of geology and mineralogy in the university 
of Edinhurgh, for which he gave the sum of £6000, an annual 
sum of £200 being likewise provided by a vote in parliament for 
the endowment of the professorship. While the negotiations 
with the Government in regard to this subject were still in 
progress, Murchison was seized with a paralytic affection on 
2 1 st of November 1870. He rallied and was able to take 
interest in current affairs until the early autumn of the follow- 
ing year. After a brief attack of bronchitis he died on the 
22nd of October 1871. Under his will there was established 
the Murchison Medal and geological fund to be awarded 
annually by the council of the Geological Society in London.

MURCIA, a maritime province of south-eastern Spain, bounded 
on the E. hy Alicante, S.E. and S. by the Mediterranean Sea, W. 
by Almeria and Granada and N. by Alhacete. Pop. (1900), 
577,987; area, 4453 sq. m. The extent of coast is about 75 m.; 
from Cape Palos westwards to Villaricos Point (where Almeria 
begins) it is fringed by hills reaching their greatest elevation 
immediately east of Cartagena; northwards from Cape Palos 
to the Alicante boundary a low sandy tongue encloses the 
shallow lagoon called Mar Menor. Eastward from the Mar 
Menor and northward from Cartagena stretches the plain known 
as El Campo de Cartagena, but the surface of the rest of the 
province is diversified by ranges of hills, belonging to the same 
system as the Sierra Nevada, which connect the mountains of 
Almeria and Granada with those of Alicante. The general 
direction of these ranges is from south-west to north-east; they 
reach their highest point (5150 ft.) on the Sierra de Espuna, 
between the Mula and Sangonera valleys. They are rich in 
iron, copper, argentiferous lead, alum, sulphur, and saltpetre. 
Mineral springs occur at Mula, Archena (hot sulphur), and 
Alhama (hot chalybeate). The greater part of the province 
drains into the Mediterranean, chiefly by the Segura, which 
enters it in the north-west below Hellin in Alhacete, and leaves 
it a little above Orihuela in Alicante; within the province it 
receives on the left the Arroyo del Jua, and on the right the 
Caravaca, Quipar, Mula, and Sangonera. The smaller streams 
of Nogalte and Albujon fall directly into the Mediterranean and 
the Mar Menor respectively. The climate is hot and dry, and

agriculture is largely dependent on irrigation, which, where 
practicable, has been carried on since the time of the Moors. 
Wheat, barley, maize, hemp, oil, and wine (the latter somewhat 
rough in quality) are produced; fruit, especially the orange, is 
abundant along the course of the Segura; mulberries for seri- 
culture are extensively grown around the capital; and the 
number of bees kept is exceptionally large. Esparto grass is 
gathered on the sandy tracts. The live stock consists chiefly of 
asses, mules, goats and pigs; horses, cattle and sheep being 
relatively few. Apart from agriculture, the principal industry 
is mining, which has its centre near Cartagena. Large quantities- 
of lead and esparto, as well as of zinc, iron and copper ores, and 
sulphur, are exported. The province is traversed by a railway 
which connects Murcia with Albacete and Valencia; from 
Alcantarilla there is a branch to Lorca and Baza. Near the 
capital and other large towns there are good roads, but the 
means of communication are defective in the remoter districts. 
This deficiency has somewhat retarded the development of 
mining, and, although it has been partly overcome by the 
construction of light railways, many rich deposits of ore remain 
unworked. The chief towns are Murcia, the capital, Cartagena, 
Lorca, La Uni6n, Mazarr6n, Yccla, Jumilla, Aguilas, Caravaca, 
Totana, Cieza, Mula, Moratalla, and Cehegin. Other towns 
with more than 7000 inhabitants are Alhama, Bullas, Fuente 
Alamo, Molina and Torre Pacheco. 

The province of Murcia was the first Spanish possession of 
the Carthaginians, by whom Nova Carthago was founded. The 
Romans included it in Hispania Tarraconensis. Under the 
Moors the province was known as Todmir, which included, 
according to Edrisi, the cities Murcia, Orihuela, Cartagena, 
Lorca, Mula and Chinchilla. The kingdom of Murcia, which 
came into independent existence after the fall of Omayyads 
(see Caliphate) included the present Albacete as well as Murcia. 
It became subject to the crown of Castile in the 13th century. 
Until 1833 the province of Murcia also included Alhacete. 

MURCIA, the capital of the Spanish province of Murcia; 
on the river Segura, 25 m. \V. of the Mediterranean Sea. Pop. 
(1000), 111,539. Murcia is connected by rail with all parts 
of Spain, and is an important industrial centre, sixth in respect 
of population among the cities of the kingdom. It has been an 
episcopal see since 1291*. It is built nearly in the centre of a 
low-lying fertile plain, known as the huerta or garden of Murcia, 
which includes the valleys of the Segura and its right-hand tribu- 
tary the Sangonera, and is surrounded by mountains. Despite 
the proximity of the sea, the climate is subject to great varia- 
tions, the summer heat being severe, while frosts are common in 
winter. The city is built mainly on the left bank of the Segura, 
which curves north-eastward after receiving the Sangonera below 
Murcia, and falls into the Mediterranean about 30 m. N.E. A 
fine stone bridge of two arches gives access to the suburb of San 
Benito, which contains the bull-ring. As a rule the streets are 
broad, straight and planted with avenues of trees, but the 
Calle de Plateria and Calle de la Traperia, which contain many 
of the principal shops, are more characteristically Spanish, being 
lined with old-fashioned balconied houses, and so narrow that 
wheeled traffic is in most parts impossible. In summer these 
thoroughfares are shaded by awnings. The Malecon, or embank- 
ment, is a fine promenade skirting the left bank of the Segura; 
the river is here crossed by a weir and supplies power to several 
silk-mills. The principal square is the Arenal or Plaza de la 
Constituci6n, planted with orange trees and adjoining the 
Glorieta Park. The cathedral, dating from 1388-1467, is the 
work of many architects; in the main it is late Gothic, but a 
Renaissance dome and a tower 480 ft. high were added in 1521, 
while a Corinthian facade was erected in the 18th century. 
There are some good paintings and fine wood-carving in the 
interior. Other noteworthy buildings are the colleges of San 
Fulgencio and San Isidro, the bishops' palace, the hospital of 
San Juan de Dios, the Moorish Alhondiga, or grain warehouse, 
the buildings of the municipal and provincial councils and 
the Contraste, which is adorned with sculptured coats-of-arms, 
and was originally designed to contain standard weights and 
xix. 2 



measures; it has become a picture-gallery. There are two 
training schools for teachers, a provincial institute and a museum. 
Since 1875 the industrial importance of Murcia has steadily 
increased. Mulberries (for silkworms), oranges and other fruits 
are largely cultivated in the huerta, and the silk industry, which 
dates from the period of Moorish rule, is still carried on. Manu- 
factures of woollen, linen and cotton goods, of saltpetre, flour, 
leather and hats, have been established in more modern times, 
and Murcia is the chief market for the agricultural produce of 
a large district. A numerous colony of gipsies has settled in the 
west of the city. 

Murcia was an Iberian town before the Punic Wars, but its 
name then, and under Roman rule, is not known, though some 
have tried to identify it with the Roman Vergilia. To the Moors, 
who took possession early in the 8th century, it was known as 
Medinat Mursiya. Edrisi described it in the 12th century as 
populous and strongly fortified. After the fall of the caliphate 
of Cordova it passed successively under the rule of Almeria, 
Toledo and Seville. In 1 172 it was taken by the Almohades, and 
from 1223 to 1243 it became the capital of an independent 
kingdom. The Castilians took it at the end of this period, 
when large numbers of immigrants from north-eastern Spain 
and Provence settled in the town; French and Catalan names are 
still not uncommon. Moorish princes continued to rule in name 
over this mixed population, but in 1269 a rising against the 
suzerain, Alphonso the Wise, led to the final incorporation of 
Murcia (which then included the present province of Albacete) 
into the kingdom of Castile. During the War of the Spanish 
Succession Bishop Luis de Belluga defended the city against 
the archducal army by flooding the huerta. In 1810 and 181 2 
it was attacked by the French under Marshal Soult. It suffered 
much from floods in 165 1, 1879 and 1907, though the construc- 
tion of the Malecon has done much to keep the Segura within 
its own channel. In 1829 many buildings, including the 
cathedral, were damaged by an earthquake. 

MURDER, in law, the unlawful killing of a person with malice 
aforethought (see Homicide). The O. Eng. moriSor comes ulti- 
mately from the Indo-European root mar-, to die, which has 
also given Lat. mors, death, and all its derivatives in English, 
French and other Rom. languages; cf. Gr. pporfc, for fxopros, 
mortal. The 0. Eng. form, Latinized as murdrum, murtrum, 
whence Fr. meurtre, is represented in other Teutonic languages 
by a cognate form, e.g. Ger. Mord, Du. moord. 

MURDOCK, WILLIAM (1 754-1839), British inventor, was 
born near the village of Auchinleck in Ayrshire on the 21st of 
August 1754. His father, John Murdoch (as the name is spelt 
in Scotland), was a millwright and miller, and William was 
brought up in the same occupation. In 1777 he entered the 
employment of Boulton & Watt in the Soho works at Birming- 
ham, and about two years afterwards he was sent to Cornwall to 
superintend the fitting of Watt's engines. It is said that while 
staying at Redruth he carried a series of experiments in the 
distillation of coal so far that in 1792 he was able to light his 
cottage and offices with gas, but the evidence is not conclusive. 
However, after his return to Birmingham about 1799, he made 
such progress in the discovery of practical methods for making, 
storing and purifying gas that in 1802 a portion of the exterior 
of the Soho factory was Ugh ted with it in celebration of the peace 
of Amiens, and in the following year it -was brought into use 
for the interior. Murdock was also the inventor of important 
improvements in the steam-engine. He was the first to devise 
an oscillating engine, of which he made a model about 1784; in 
1786 he was busy — somewhat to the annoyance of both Boulton 
and Watt — with a steam carriage or road locomotive; and in 
1799 he invented the long D slide valve. He is also believed to 
have been the real deviser of the sun and planet motion patented 
by Watt in 1781. In addition his ingenuity was directed to 
the utilization of compressed air, and in 1803 he constructed 
a steam gun. He retired from business in 1830, and died at Soho 
on the 15th of November 1839. 

At the celebration of the centenary of gas lighting in 1892, a bust 
of Murdock was unveiled by Lord Kelvin in the Wallace Monument.

Stirling, and there is also a bust of him by Sir F. L. Chantrey at 
Handsworth Church, where he was buried. His " Account of the 
Application of Gas from Coal to Economical Purposes " appeared 
in the Phil. Trans, for 1808. 

MURE, SIR WILLIAM (1 594-1657), Scottish writer, son of 
Sir William Mure of Rowallan, was born in 1594. His mother 
was Elizabeth, sister of the poet Alexander Montgomcrie (q.v.). 
He was a member of the Scottish parliament in 1643, and took 
part in the English campaign of 1644. He was wounded at 
Marston Moor, but a month later was commanding a regiment 
at Newcastle. He died in 1657. He wrote Dido and Aeneas; 
a translation (1628) of Boyd of Trochrig's Latin Hecatombe 
Christiana; The True Crucifixe for True Catholikes (1629); a 
paraphrase of the Psalms; the Historie and Descent of the 
House of Rowallane; A Counter-buff to Lysimachus Nicanor] 
TheCry of Blood and of a Broken Covenant (1650); besides much 
miscellaneous verse and many sonnets. 

A complete edition of his works was edited by William Tough 
for the Scottish Text Society (2 vols., 1898). Mure's Lute-Book, 
a musical document of considerable interest, is preserved in the 
Laing collection of MSS. in the library of the university of 
Edinburgh. 

MURE, WILLIAM (1790-1860), Scottish classical scholar, 
was born at Caldwell, Ayrshire, on the 9th of July 1799. He 
was educated at Westminster School and the universities of 
Edinburgh and Bcnn. From 1846 to 1855 he represented the 
county of Renfrew in parliament in the Conservative interest, 
and was lord rector of Glasgow University in 1847-1848. For 
many years he devoted his leisure to Greek 'studies, and in 
1 850-1857 he published five volumes of a Critical History of 
the Language and Literature of Ancient Greece, which, though 
uncompleted and somewhat antiquated, is still useful. He died 
in London on the 1st of April i860. 

MURENA, the name of a Roman plebeian family from 
Lanuvium, belonging to the Licinian gens, said to be derived 
from the fondness of one of the family for lampreys (murenae) . 
The principal members of the family were Lucius Licinius 
Murena, who was defeated by Mithradates in Asia in 81 B.C., and 
his son Lucius Licinius Murena, who was defended by Cicero 
in 62 B.C. against a charge of bribery (Cic. Pro Murena). The 
son was for several years legate of Lucius Licinius Lucullus 
in the third Mithradatic War. In 65 he was praetor and made 
himself popular by the magnificence of the games provided by 
him. As administrator of Transalpine Gaul after his praetorship 
he gained the goodwill of both provincials and Romans by his 
impartiality. In 62 he was elected consul, but before entering 
upon office he was accused of bribery by Scrvius Sulpicius,an 
unsuccessful competitor, supported by Marcus Porcius Cato 
the younger and Servius Sulpicius Rufus, a famous jurist and 
son of the accuser. Murena was defended by Marcus Licinius 
Crassus (afterwards triumvir), Quintus Hortensius and Cicero, 
and acquitted, although it seems probable that he was guilty. 
During his consulship he passed a law (lex Junia Licinia) which 
enforced more strictly the provision of the lex Caecilia Didia — 
that laws should be promulgated three nundinae before they 
were proposed to the comitia, and further enacted that, in order 
to prevent forgery, a copy of every proposed statute should be 
deposited before witnesses in the aerarium. 

MURETUS, the Latinized name of Marc Antoine Muret 
(1526-1585), French humanist, who was born at Muret near 
Limoges on the 12th of April 1526. At the age of eighteen he 
attracted the notice of the elder Scaliger, and was invited to 
lecture in the archiepiscopal college at Auch. He afterwards 
taught Latin at Villeneuve, and then at Bordeaux, Some time 
before 1552 he delivered a course of lectures in the college of 
Cardinal Lemoine at Paris, which was largely attended, Henry 
II. and his queen being among his hearers. His success made him 
many enemies, and he was thrown into prison on a disgraceful 
charge, but released by the intervention of powerful friends. 
The same accusation was brought against him at Toulouse, and 
he only saved his life by timely flight. The records of the town 
show that he was burned in effigy as a Huguenot and as shame- 
fully immoral (1554). After a wandering and insecure life of 



some years in Italy, he received and accepted the invitation of 
the Cardinal Ippolyte d'Este to settle in Rome in 1559. In 
1 56 1 he revisited France as a member of the cardinal's suite 
at the conference between Roman Catholics and Protestants held 
at Poissy. He returned to Rome in 1563. His lectures gained 
him a European reputation, and in 1578 he received a tempting 
offer from the king of Poland to become teacher of jurisprudence 
in his new college at Cracow. Muretus, however, who about 
1576 had taken holy orders, was induced by the liberality of 
Gregory XIII. to remain in Rome, where he died on the 4th of 
June 1585.

MUREXIDE (NH4-C 8 H 4 N 5 06,H 2 0), the ammonium salt of 
purpuric acid. It may be prepared by heating alloxantin in 
ammonia gas to ioo° C, or by boiling uramil with mercuric oxide 
(J. v. Liebig, F. Wohler, Ann., 1838, 26, 319), 2C 4 H 6 N 3 3 +0 = 
NH4-C 8 H 4 N 6 6 +H 2 0. W. N. Hartley (Jour. Chem. Soc, 1905, 
87, 1 791) found considerable difficulty in obtaining specimens 
of murexide sufficiently pure to give concordant results when 
examined by means of their absorption spectra, and conse- 
quently devised a new method of preparation for murexide. In 
this process alloxantin is dissolved in 'a large excess of boiling 
absolute alcohol, and dry ammonia gas is passed into the solution 
for about three hours. The solution is then filtered from the 
precipitated murexide, which is washed with absolute alcohol 
and dried. The salt obtained in this way is in the anhydrous 
state. It may also be prepared by digesting alloxan with 
alcoholic ammonia at about 78 C; the purple solid so formed 
is easily soluble in water, and the . solution produced is 
indistinguishable from one of murexide. 

On the constitution of murexide see also O. Piloty (Ann., 1904,. 
333, 30); R. Mohlau (Ber., 1904, 37, 2686); and M. Slimmer and J. 
Stieglitz (Amer. Chem. Jour., 1904, 31, 661). 

MURFREESBORO, a city and the county-seat of Rutherford 
county, Tennessee, U.S.A., near the Stone River, 32 m. S.E. of 
Nashville. Pop. (1890), 3739; (i9<> )> 3999 (2248 negroes); 
(19 10), 4679. It is served by the Nashville Chattanooga & St 
Louis railway. It is in an agricultural region where cotton is 
an important crop, and has a considerable trade in red cedar, 
hardwood, cotton, livestock and grain; it has also various 
manufactures. At Murfreesboro are Soule College for girls 
(Methodist Episcopal South; 1852), Tennessee College for girls 
(Baptist, 1906), Mooney School for boys (1901), and Bradley 
Academy for negroes. Murfreesboro was settled in 181 1; was 
incorporated in 181 7, and from 1819 to 1825 was the capital 
of the state. It was named in honour of Colonel Hardy 
Murfree (1 752-1809), a native of North Carolina, who served as 
an officer of North Carolina troops in the War of Independence, 
and after 1807 lived in Tennessee. About 2 m. west of the 
city the battle of Murfreesboro, or Stone River (q.v.), was 
fought on the 31st of December 1862 and the 2nd of January 
1863. 

MURGER, HENRY (1822-1861), French man of letters, was 
born in Paris on the 24th of March 1822. His father was a 
German concierge and a tailor. At the age of fifteen Murger was 
sent into a lawyer's office, but the occupation was uncongenial 
and his father's trade still more so; and he became secretary to 
Count Alexei Tolstoi. He published in 1843 a poem entitled 
Via dolorosa, but it made no mark. He also tried journalism, 
and the paper Le Castor, which figures in his Vie de Bohtme 
as having combined devotion to the interests of the hat trade 
with recondite philosophy and elegant literature, is said to have 
existed, though shortlived. In 1848 appeared the collected 
sketches called Scenes de la vie de Bohime.- This book describes 
the fortunes and misfortunes, the loves, studies, amusements 
and sufferings of a group of impecunious students, artists and

men of letters, of whom Rodolphe represents Murger himself, 
while the others have been more or less positively identified. 
Murger, in fact, belonged to a clique of so-called Bohemians, the 
most remarkable of whom, besides himself, were Privat d'Angle- 
mont and Champfleury. La Vie de Bokime, arranged for the 
stage in collaboration with Theodore Barriere, was produced 
at the Varietes on the 22nd of November 1849, and was a 
triumphant success; it afterwards formed the basis of Puccini's 
opera, La Bohime (1898). From this time it was easy for 
Murger to live by journalism and general literature. He was 
introduced in 1851 to the Revue des deux mondes. But he was a 
slow, fastidious and capricious worker, and his years of hardship 
and dissipation had impaired his health. He published among 
other works Claude et Marianne in 1851 ; a comedy, Le Bonhomme 
Jadis in 1852; Le Pays Latin in 1852; Adeline Prolat (one of the 
most graceful and innocent if not the most original of his tales) 
in 1853; and Les Buveurs d'eau in 1855. This last, the most 
powerful of his books next to the Vie de Bohime, traces the fate 
of certain artists and students who, exaggerating their own 
powers and disdaining merely profitable work, come to an evil 
end not less rapidly than by dissipation. Some years before 
his death, which took place in a maison de santi near Paris on 
the 28th of January 1861, Murger went to live at Marlotte, near 
Fontainebleau, and there he wrote an unequal book entitled 
Le Sabot rouge (i860), in which the character of the French 
peasant is uncomplimentarily treated.

MURGHAB, a river of Afghanistan, which flows into Russian 
territory. It rises in the Firozkhoi highlands, the northern 
scarp of which is defined by the Band-i-Turkestan, and after 
traversing that plateau from east to west it turns north through* 
deep defiles to Bala Murghab. Beyond this, in the neighbour- 
hood of Maruchak, it forms for a space the boundary-line between 
Afghan and Russian Turkestan; then joining the Kushk river 
at Pul-i-Khishti (Tash Kupri) it runs north to Merv, losing itself 
in the sands of the Merv desert after a course of about 450 m., 
its exact source being unknown. In the neighbourhood of 
Bala Murghab it is 50 yds. broad and some 3 ft. deep, with a 
rapid current. In the lower part of its course it is flanked by 
a remarkable network of canals. The ancient city of Merv, 
which was on its banks, was the great centre of medieval Arab 
trade, and Buddhist caves are found in the scarped cliffs of its 
right bank near Panjdeh. 

MURI, a province of the British protectorate of Northern 
Nigeria. It lies approximately between 9 and n° 40' E. and 
7° 10' and 9 40' N. The river Benue divides it through its 
length, and the portion on the southern bank of the river is 
watered by streams flowing from the Cameroon region to the 
Benue. The province is bordered S. by Southern Nigeria, 
S.E. by German territory (Cameroon), E. by the province of 
Yola, N. by Bauchi, W. by Nassarawa and Bassa. The district 
of Katsena-Allah extends south of the Benue . considerably 
west of 9 E., the approximate limit of the remainder of the 
province. Muri has an area of 25,800 sq. m. and an estimated 
population of about 828,000. The province is rich in forest 
products and the Niger . Company maintains trading stations 
on the river. Cotton is grown, and spinning thread, weaving 
and dyeing afford occupation to many thousands. The valley 
of the Benue has a climate generally unhealthy to Europeans, 
but there are places in the northern part of the province, such 
as the Fula settlement of Wase on a southern spur of the 
Murchison hills, where the higher altitude gives an excellent 
climate, Muri includes the ancient Jukon empire together with 
various small Fula states and a number of pagan tribes, among 
whom the Munshi, who extend into the provinces of Nassarawa 
and Bassa, are among the most turbulent. The Munshi occupy 
about 4000 sq. m. in the Katsena-Allah district. The pagan 
tribes in the north of the province are lawless cannibals who by 
constant outrages and murders of traders long rendered the main 
trade route to Bauchi unsafe, and cut off the markets of the 
Benue valley and the Cameroon from the Hausa states. Only 



two routes, one via Wase and the other via Gatari, pass through 
this belt. In the south of the province a similar belt of hostile 
pagans closed the access to the Cameroon except by two routes, 
Takum and Beli. For Hausa traders to cross the Muri province 
was a work of such danger and expense that before the advent 
of British administration the attempt was seldom made. 

Muri came nominally under British control in 1900. The 
principal effort of the administration has been to control and 
open the trade routes. In 1904 an expedition against the 
northern cannibals resulted in the capture of their principal 
fortresses and the settlement and opening to trade of a large 
district, the various routes to the Benue being rendered safe. 
In 1905 an expedition against the Munshi, rendered necessary 
by an unprovoked attack on the Niger Company's station at 
Abinsi, had a good effect in reducing the riverain portion of 
this tribe to submission. The absence of any central native 
authority delayed the process of bringing the province under 
administrative control. Its government lias been organized 
on the same system as the rest of Northern Nigeria, and is under 
a British resident. It has been divided into three administrative 
divisions — east, central and west — with their respective head- 
quarters at Lau, Amar and Ibi. Provincial and native courts 
of justice have been established. The telegraph has been' 
carried to the town of Muri. Muri is one of the provinces in 
which the slave trade was most active, and its position between 
German territory and the Hausa states rendered it in the early 
days of the British administration a favourite route for the 
smuggling of slaves. 

MURILLO, BART0L0M6 ESTEBAN (1617-1682), Spanish 
painter, son of Gaspar Esteban Murillo and Maria Perez, was 
born at Seville in 161 7, probably at the en J of the year, as he 
was baptized on the first of January 1618. Esteban-Murillo 
appears to have been the compound surname of the father, 
but some inquirers consider that, in accordance with a frequent 
Andalusian custom, the painter assumed the surname of his 
maternal grandmother, Elvira Murillo, in addition to that of 
his father. His parents (the father an artisan of a humble 
class), having been struck with the sketches which the boy 
was accustomed to make, placed him under the care of their 
distant relative, Juan del Castillo, the painter. Juan, a correct 
draughtsman and dry colourist, taught him all the mechanical 
parts of his profession with extreme care, and Murillo proved 
himself an apt pupil. The artistic appliances of his mastef's 
studio were not abundant, and were often of the simplest kind. 
A few casts, some stray fragments of sculpture and a lay figure 
formed the principal aids available for the Sevillian student of 
art. A living model was a luxury generally beyond the means 
of the school, but on great occasions the youths would strip in 
turn and proffer an arm or a leg to be jstudied by their fellows. 
Objects of still life, however, were much studied by Murillo, 
and he early learnt to hit off the ragged urchins of Seville. 
Murillo in a few years painted as well as his master, and as 
stiffly. His two pictures of the Virgin, executed during this 
period, show how thoroughly he had mastered the style, with all 
its defects. Castillo was a kind man, but his removal to Cadiz 
in 1 630-1 640 threw his favourite pupil upon his own resources. 
The fine school of Zurbaran was too expensive for the poor 
lad; his parents were either dead or too poor to help him, and 
he was compelled to earn his bread by painting rough pictures 
for the " feria " or public fair of Seville. The religious daubs 
exposed at that mart were generally of as low an order as the 
prices paid for them. A " pintura de la feria " (a picture for 
the fair) was a proverbial expression for an execrably bad one; 
yet the street painters who thronged the market-place with 
their "clumsy saints and unripe Madonnas" not unfrequently 
rose to be able and even famous artists. This rough-and-ready 
practice, partly for the market-place, partly for converts in 
Mexico and Peru, for whom Madonnas and popular saints 
were produced and shipped off by the dozen, doubtless increased 
Murillo's manual dexterity; but, if we may judge from the 
picture of the "Virgin and Child" shown in the Murillo-room at 
Seville as belonging to this period, he made little improvement

MURILLO 



in colouring or in general strength of design. Struck by the 
favourable change which travel had wrought upon the style 
of his brother artist Pedro de Moya, Murillo in 1642 resolved 
to make a journey to Flanders or Italy. Having bought a large 
quantity of canvas, he cut it into squares of different sizes, which 
he converted into pictures of a kind likely to sell. The American 
traders bought up his pieces, and he found himself sufficiently 
rich to carry out his design. He placed his sister, who was 
dependent on him, under the care of some friends, and without 
divulging his plans to any one set out for Madrid. On reaching 
the capital he waited on Velazquez, his fellow-townsman — then 
at the summit of his fortune — and asked for some introduc- 
tion to friends in Rome. The master liked the youth, and 
offered him lodging in his own house, and proposed to procure 
him admission to the royal galleries of the capital. Murillo 
accepted the offer, and here enjoyed the masterpieces of Italy 
and Flanders without travelling beyond the walls of Madrid. 
The next two years- were chiefly spent in copying from Ribera, 
Vandyck and Velazquez; and in 1644 he so astonished the latter 
with some of his efforts that they were submitted to the king 
and the court. His patron now urged him to go to Rome, 
and offered him letters to smooth his way; but Murillo preferred 
returning to his sister and his native Seville. 

The friars of the convent of San Francesco in Seville had 
about this time determined to adorn the walls of their small 
cloister in a manner worthy of their patron saint. But the 
brotherhood had no money; and after endless begging they found 
themselves incapable of employing an artist of name to execute 
the task. Murillo was needy, and offered his services; after 
balancing their own poverty against his obscurity the friars 
bade him begin. Murillo covered the walls with eleven large 
pictures of remarkable power and beauty — displaying by turns 
the strong colouring of Ribera, the lifelike truthfulness of 
Velazquez, and the sweetness of Vandyck. Among them were 
to be found representations of San Francesco, of San Diego, of 
Santa Clara and of San Gil, These pictures were executed 
in his earliest style, commonly called his frio or cold style. It 
was based chiefly on Ribera and Caravaggio, and was dark with 
a decided outline. This rich collection is no longer in Seville; 
Marshal Soult carried off ten of the works. The fame of these 
productions soon got abroad, and " El Claustro Chico " swarmed 
daily with artists and critics. Murillo was no longer friendless 
arid unknown. The rich and the noble of Seville overwhelmed 
him with their commissions and their praises. 

In 1648 Murillo married a wealthy lady of rank, Dona Beatriz 
de Cabrera y Sotomayor, of the neighbourhood of Seville, and 
his house soon became the favourite resort of artists and 
connoisseurs. About this time he was associated with the land- 
scape-painter Yriarte — the two artists interchanging figures and 
landscapes for their respective works; but they did not finally 
agree, and the co-operation came to an end. Murillo now 
painted the well-known " Flight into Egypt," and shortly 
afterwards changed his earliest style of painting for his calido 
or warm style. His drawing was still well defined, but his 
outlines became softer and his figures rounder, and his colouring 
gained in warmth and transparency. His first picture of this 
style, according to Cean Bermudez, was a representation of 
" Our Lady of the Conception," and was painted in 1652 for 
the brotherhood of the True Cross; he received for it 2500 reals 
(£26). In 1655 he executed his two famous paintings of " San 
Leandro " and " San Isidoro " at the order of Don Juan Federigo, 
archdeacon of Carmona, which are now in the cathedral of 
Seville. These are two noble portraits, finished with great care 
and admirable effect, but the critics complain of the figures 
being rather short. His next picture, the " Nativity of the 
Virgin," painted for the chapter, is regarded as one of the most 
delightful specimens of his calido style. In the following year 
(1656) the samebody gave him an order for a vast picture of San 
Antonio de Padua, for which he received 10,000 reals (£104). 
This is one of his most celebrated performances, and still hangs 
in the baptistery of the cathedral. It was " repaired " in 1833; 
the grandeur of the design, however, and the singular richness 



of the colouring may still be traced. The same year saw him 
engaged on four large semicircular pictures, designed by his 
friend and patron Don Justino Neve y Yevenes, to adorn the 
walls of the church of Santa Maria la Blanca. The first two 
(now in Madrid) were meant to illustrate the history of the 
Festival of Our Lady of the Snow, or the foundation of the 
Roman basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore. The one represents 
the wealthy but childless Roman senator and his lady asleep 
and dreaming; the other exhibits the devout pair relating 
their dream to Pope Liberius. Of these two noble paintings 
the Dream is the finer, and in it is to be noticed the commence- 
ment of Murillo's third and last style, known as the vaporoso or 
vapoury. It should be noted, however, that the three styles 
are not strictly separable into date-periods; for the painter 
alternated the styles accordingly to his subject-matter or the 
mood of his inspiration, the calido being the most frequent. In 
the vaporoso method the well-marked outlines and careful 
drawing of his former styles disappear, the outlines are lost 
in the misty blending of the light and shade, and the general 
finish betrays more haste than was usual with Murillo. After 
many changes of fortune, these two pictures now hang in the 
Academy at Madrid. The remaining pieces executed for this 
small church were a " Virgin of the Conception " and a figure of 
" Faith." Soult laid his hands on these also, and they have not 
been recovered. 

In 1658 Murillo undertook and consummated a task which 
had hitherto baffled all the artists of Spain, and even royalty 
itself. This was the establishing of a public academy of art. By 
superior tact and good temper he overcame the vanity of Valdes 
Leal and the presumption of the younger Herrera, and secured 
their co-operation. The Academy of Seville was accordingly 
opened for the first time in January 1660, and Murillo and the 
second Herrera were chosen presidents. The former continued 
to direct it during the following year; but the calls of his studio 
induced him to leave it in other hands. It was then flourishing, 
but not for long. 

Passing over some half-length pictures of saints and a dark- 
haired Madonna, painted in 1668 for the chapter-room of the 
cathedral of his native city, we enter upon the most splendid 
period of Murillo's career. In 1661 Don Miguel Manara Vicen- 
telo de Leca, who had recently turned to a life of sanctity from 
one of the wildest profligacy, resolved to raise money for the 
restoration of the dilapidated Hospital de la Caridad, of whose 
pious gild he was himself a member. Manara commissioned 
his friend Murillo to paint eleven pictures for this edifice of San 
Jorge. Three of these pieces represented the " Annunciation," 
the " Infant Saviour," and the " Infant St John." The remaining 
eight are considered Murillo's masterpieces. They consist of 
" Moses striking the Rock," the " Return of the Prodigal," 
" Abraham receiving the Three Angels," the "Charity of San 
Juan de Dios," the " Miracle of the Loaves and Fishes," " Our 
Lord healing the Paralytic," " St Peter released from Prison by 
the Angel," and "St Elizabeth of Hungary." These works 
occupied the artist four years, and in 1674 he received for his 
eight great pictures 78,115 reals or about £800. The " Moses, " 
the " Loaves and Fishes," the " San Juan," and the three 
subjects which we have named first, are still at Seville; the 
French carried off the rest, but the " St Elizabeth " and the 
" Prodigal Son " are now back in Spain. For compass and 
vigour the " Moses " stands first; but the " Prodigal's Return " 
and the " St Elizabeth " were considered by Bermudez the 
most perfect of all as works of art. The front of this famous 
hospital was also indebted to the genius of Murillo; five large 
designs in blue glazed tiles were executed from his drawings. 
He had scarcely completed the undertakings for this edifice 
when his favourite Franciscans again solicited his aid. He 
accordingly executed some twenty paintings for the humble 
little church known as the Convent de los Capucinos. Seventeen 
of these Capuchin pictures are preserved in the Museum of 
Seville. Of these the " Charity of St Thomas of Villanueva " 
is reckoned the best. Murillo himself was wont to call it " su 
lienzo " (his own picture). Another little piece of extraordinary

merit, which once hung in this church, is the " Virgin of the 
Napkin," believed to have been painted on a " servilleta " and 
presented to the cook of the Capuchin brotherhood as a memorial 
of the artist's pencil. 

In 1670 Murillo is said to have declined an invitation to court, 
preferring to labour among the brown coats of Seville. Eight 
years afterwards his friend the canon Justino again employed 
him to paint three pieces for the Hospital de los Venerables: 
the " Mystery of the Immaculate Conception/' " St Peter 
Weeping," and the " Blessed Virgin." As a mark of esteem, 
Murillo next painted a full-length portrait of the canon. The 
spaniel at the feet of the priest has been known to call forth a 
snarl from a living dog. His portraits generally, though few, 
are of great beauty. Towards the close of his life Murillo 
executed a series of pictures illustrative of the life* of " the 
glorious doctor " for the Augustinian convent at Seville. This 
brings us to the last work of the artist. Mounting a scaffolding 
one day at Cadiz (whither he had gone in 1681) to execute the 
higher parts of a large picture of the " Espousal of St Catherine," 
on which he was engaged for the Capuchins of that town, he 
stumbled, and fell so violently that be received a hurt from which 
he never recovered. The great picture was left unfinished, and 
the artist returned to Seville to die. He died as he had lived, 
a humble, pious, brave man, on the 3rd of April 1682 in the arms 
of the chevalier Pedro Nunez de Villavicencio, an intimate 
friend and one of his best pupils. Another of his numerous 
pupils was Sebastian Gomez, named " Murillo *s Mulatto." 
Murillo left two sons (one of them at first an indifferent painter, 
afterwards a priest) and a daughter — his wife having died 
before him. 

Murillo has always been one of the most popular of painters — 
not in Spain alone. His works show great technical attainment 
without much style, and a strong feeling for ordinary nature 
and for truthful or sentimental expression without lofty beauty 
or ideal elevation. His ecstasies of Madonnas and Saints are 
the themes of some of his most celebrated achievements. Take 
as an example the " Immaculate Conception " (or " Assumption 
of the Virgin/' for the titles may, with reference to Murillo 's 
treatments of this subject, almost be interchanged) in the 
Louvre, a picture for which, on its sale from the Soult collection, 
one of the largest prices on record was given in 1852, some 
£24,600. His subjects may be divided into two great groups — 
the scenes from low life (which were a new experiment in Spanish 
art, so far as the subjects of children are concerned), and the 
Scriptural, legendary and religious works. The former, of 
which some salient specimens are in the Dulwich Gallery, are, 
although undoubtedly truthful, neither ingenious not sym- 
pathetic; sordid unsightliness and roguish squalor are their 
foundation. Works of this class belong mostly to the earlier 
years of Murillo 's practice. The subjects in which the painter 
most excels are crowded compositions in which some act of 
saintliness, involving the ascetic or self-mortifying element, 
is being performed — subjects which, while repulsive in some of 
their details, emphasize the broadly human and the expressly 
Catholic conceptions of life. A famous example is the picture, 
now in the Madrid Academy, of St Elizabeth of Hungary washing 
patients afflicted with the scab or itch, and hence commonly 
named " El Tinoso." Technically considered, it unites his three 
styles of painting, more especially the cold and the warm. His 
power of giving atmosphere to combined groups of figures is one 
of the marked characteristics of Murillo 's art; and he may be said 
to have excelled in this respect all his predecessors or con- 
temporaries of whatever school. 

Seville must still be visited by persons who wish to study 
Murillo thoroughly. A large number of the works which used 
to adorn this city have, however, been transported else- 
whither. In the Prado Museum at Madrid are forty-five 
specimens of Murillo— the " Infant Christ and the Baptist " 
(named " Los Ninos della Concha "), " St Ildefonso vested with 
a Chasuble by the Madonna," &c; in the Museo della Trinidad, 
" Christ and the Virgin appearing to St Francis in a Cavern " 
(an immense composition), and various others. In the National 



Gallery, London, the chief example is the " Holy Family "; this 
was one of the master's latest works, painted in Cadiz. In 
public galleries in the United Kingdom there are altogether 
twenty-four examples by Murillo; in those of Spain, seventy-one. 
Murillo, who was the last pre-eminent painter of Seville, was 
an indefatigable and prolific worker, hardly leaving his painting- 
room save for his devotions in church; he realized large prices, 
according to the standard of his time, and made a great fortune. 
His character is recorded as amiable and soft, yet independent, 
subject also to sudden impulses, not unmixed with passion.

MURIMUTH, ADAM (c. 1 274-1347), English ecclesiastic and 
chronicler, was born in 1274 or 1275 and educated in the civil 
law at Oxford. Between 13 12 and 13 18 he practised in the 
papal curia at Avignon. Edward II. and Archbishop Winchelsey 
were among his clients, and his legal services secured for him 
canonries at Hereford and St Paul's, and the precentorship 
of Exeter Cathedral. In 133 1 he retired to a country living 
(Wraysbury, Bucks), and devoted himself to writing the history 
of his own times. His Continuatio chronicarum, begun not 
earlier than 1325, starts from the year 1303, and was carried 
up to 1347, the year of his death. Meagre at first, it becomes 
fuller about 1340 and is specially valuable for the history of the 
French wars. Murimuth has no merits of style, and gives a 
bald narrative of events. But he incorporates many documents 
in the latter part of his book. The annals of St. Paul's which 
have been edited by Bishop Stubbs, are closely related to the 
work of Murimuth, but probably not from his pen. The 
Continuatio was carried on, after his death, by an anonymous 
writer to the year 1380. 

The only complete edition of the Continuatio chronicarum is that 
by E. M. Thompson (Rolls series, 1889). The preface to this edition, 
and to W. Stubbs's Chronicles of Edward I. and II., vol. i. (Rolls 
series, 1882), should be consulted. The anonymous continuation 
is printed in T. Hog's edition of Murimuth (Eng* Hist. Soe,, London, 
1846). (H. W. C. D.) 

MURNER, THOMAS (1475-1537?), German satirist, was 
born on the 24th of December 1475 at Oberehnheim near Strass- 
burg. In 1490 he entered the order of Franciscan monks, and 
in 1495 began a wandering life, studying and then teaching and 
preaching in Freiburg-in-Breisgau, Paris, Cracow and Strassburg. 
The emperor Maximilian I. crowned him in 1505 poela laureatus; 
in 1506, he was created doctor theologiae t and in 1513 was ap- 
pointed custodian of the Franciscan monastery in Strassburg, 
an office which, on account of a scurrilous publication, he was 
forced to vacate the following year. Late in life, in 1518, he 
began the study of jurisprudence at the university of Bajsel, 
and in 1519 took the degree of doctor juris. After journeys in 
Italy and England, he again settled in Strassburg, but, disturbed 
by the Reformation, sought an exile at Lucerne in Switzerland 
in- 1526. In 1533 he was appointed priest of Oberehnheim, 
where he died in 1537, or, according to some accounts, in 1536. 
Murner was an energetic and passionate character, who made 
enemies wherever he went. There is not a trace of human 
kindness in his satires, which were directed against the cor- 
ruption of the times, the Reformation, and especially against 
Luther. His most powerful satire — and the most virulent

MUROM, a town of Russia, in the government of Vladimir, 
on the craggy left bank of the Oka, close to its confluence with 
the Tesha, 108 m. by rail S.E. of the city of Vladimir. Pop. 
(1900), 12,874. Muron has an old cathedral. It is the chief 
entrepot for grain from the basin of the lfcwer Oka, and carries 
on an active trade with Moscow and Nizhniy-Novgorod. It is 
famed, as in ancient times, for kitchen-gardens, especially for 
its cucumbers and seed for canaries. Its once famous tanneries 
have lost their importance, but the manufacture of linen has 
increased; it has also steam flour-mills, distilleries, manufac- 
tories of soap and of iron implements. 

MURPHY, ARTHUR (1727-1805), Irish actor and dramatist, 
son of a Dublin merchant, was born at Clomquin, Roscommon, 
on the 27th of December 1727. From 1738 to 1744, under 
the name of Arthur French, he was a student at the English 
college at St Omer. He entered the counting-house of a mer- 
chant at Cork on recommendation of his uncle, Jeffery French, 
in 1747. A refusal to go to Jamaica alienated French's interest, 
and Murphy exchanged his situation for one in London. By 
the autumn of 1752 he was publishing the Gray's Inn Journal, 
a periodical in the style of the Spectator. Two years later he 
became an actor, and appeared in the title-rdles of Richard UL 
and Othello; as Biron in Sou theme's Fatal Marriage; and as 
Osmyn in Congreve's Mourning Bride. His first farce, The 
Apprentice, was given at Drury Lane on the 2nd of January 
1756. It was followed, among other plays, by The Upholsterer 
(1757), The Orphan of China (1759), The Way to Keep Him 
(1760), All in the Wrong (1761), The Grecian Daughter (1772), 
and Know Your Own Mind (1777). These were almost all 
adaptations from the French, and were very successful, securing 
for their author both fame and wealth. .Murphy edited a 
political periodical, called the Test, in support of Henry Fox, by 
whose influence he was called to the bar at Lincoln's Inn, 
although he had been refused at the Middle Temple in 1757 
on account of his connexion with the stage. Murphy also 
wrote a biography of Fielding, an essay on the life and genius 
of Samuel Johnson and translations of Sallust and Tacitus. 
Towards the close of his life the office of a commissioner of 
bankrupts and a pension of £200 were conferred upon him 
by government. He died on the 18th of June 1805. 

MURPHY, JOHN FRANCIS (1853- ), American landscape 
painter, was bom at Oswego, New York, on the nth of 
December 1853. He first exhibited at the National Academy 
of Design in 1876, and was made an associate in 1885 and a 
full academician two years later. He became a member of the 
Society of American Artists (1901) and of the American Water 
Color Society. 

MURPHY, ROBERT (1806-1843), British mathematician, the 
son of a poor shoemaker, was born at Mallow, in Ireland, in 
1806. At the age of thirteen, while working as an apprentice 
in his father's shop, he became known to certain gentlemen in 
the neighbourhood as a self-taught mathematician. Through 
their exertions, after attending a classical school in his native 
town, he was admitted to Caius College, Cambridge, in 1825. 
Third wrangler in 1829, he was elected in the same year a fellow 
of his college. A course of dissipation led him into debt; his 
fellowship was sequestered for the benefit of his creditors, and 
he was obliged to leave Cambridge in December 1832. After 
living for some time with his relations in Ireland, he repaired 
to Loudon in 1836, a penniless literary adventurer. In 1838 
he became examiner in mathematics and physics at London 
University. He had already contributed several mathematical 
papers to the Cambridge Philosophical Transactions (1831-1836), 
Philosophical Magazine (1833-1842), and the Philosophical 
Transactions (1837), and had published Elementary Principles of 
the Theories of Electricity (1833). He now wrote for the " Library 
of Useful Knowledge " a Treatise on the Theory of Algebraical 
Equations (1839). He died on the 12th of March 1843. ' 



MURPHYSBORO, a city and the county-seat of Jackson 
county, Illinois, U.S.A., in the south part of the state, on the 
Big Muddy River, about 57 m. N. of Cairo. Pop. (1800), 3880; 
(1900), 6463, including 557 foreign-born and 456 negroes; (1910), 
7485. It is served by the Illinois Central, the Mobile & Ohio 
and the St Louis, Iron Mountain & Southern railways. It is 
the centre for a farming region, in which there are deposits of 
coal, iron, lead and shale, and there are various manufactures 
in the city. Murphysboro was incorporated in 1867, and re- 
incorporated in 1875.

MURRAY (or Moray), EARLS OF. The earldom of Moray was 
one of the seven original earldoms of Scotland, its lands corre- 
sponding roughly to the modern counties of Inverness and Ross. 
Little is known of the earls until about 13 14, when Sir Thomas 
Randolph, a nephew of King Robert Bruce, was created earl 
of Moray (q.v.), and the Randolphs held the earldom until 1346, 
when the childless John Randolph, 3rd earl of this line and a 
soldier of repute, was killed at the battle of Neville's Cross. 
According to some authorities the earldom was then held by 
John's sister Agnes (c. 131 2-1369) and her husband, Patrick 
Dunbar, earl of March or Dunbar (c. 1 285-1368). However 
this may be, in 1359 an English prince, Henry Plantagenet, 
duke of Lancaster (d. 1361), was made earl of Moray by King 
David II.; but in 1372 John Dunbar (d. 1391), a graridson of 
Sir Thomas Randolph and a son-in-law of Robert II., obtained 
the earldom. The last of the Dunbar earls was James Dunbar, 
who was murdered in August 1429, and after this date his 
daughter Elizabeth and her husband, Archibald Douglas (d. 1455), 
called themselves earl and countess of Moray. 

The next family to bear this title was an illegitimate branch 
of the royal house of Stuart, James IV. creating his natural 
son, James Stuart (c. 1499-1544), earl of Moray. James died 
without sons, and after the title had been borne for a short time 
by George Gordon, 4th earl of Huntly (c. 1 514-1562), who 
was killed at Corrichie in 1562, it was bestowed in 1562 by 
Mary Queen of Scots upon her half-brother, an illegitimate son 
of James V. This was the famous regent, James Stuart, earl 
of Moray, or Murray (see below), who was murdered in January 
1570; after this event a third James Stuart, who had married 
the regent's daughter Elizabeth (d. 1591), held the earldom. 
He, who was called the " bonny earl," was killed by his heredi- 
tary enemies, the Gordons, in February 1592, when his son James 
(d. 1638) succeeded to the title. The earldom of Moray has 
remained in the Stuart family since this date. Alexander, the 
4th earl (d. 1701), was secretary of state for Scotland from 1680 
to 1689; and in 1796 Francis, the 9th earl (1 737-1810), was 
made a peer of the United Kingdom as Baron Stuart.

Sir J. B. Paul (1909). 

MURRAY, ALEXANDER STUART (1841-1904), British 
archaeologist, was born at Arbroath on the 8th of January 1841, 
and educated there, at Edinburgh high school and at the 
universities of Edinburgh and Berlin. In 1867 he entered the 
British Museum as an assistant in the department of Greek and 
Roman antiquities under Sir Charles Newton, whom he suc- 
ceeded in 1886. His younger brother, George Robert Milne 
Murray (b. 1858), was made keeper of the botanical department 
in 1895, the only instance of two brothers becoming heads of 
departments at the museum. In 1873 Dr Murray published a 
Manual of Mythology, and in the following year contributed to 
the Contemporary Review two articles — one on the Homeric 
question — which led to a friendship with Mr Gladstone, the 
other on Greek painters. In 1 880-1 883 he brought out his 
History of Greek Sculpture, which at once became a standard 
work. In 1886 he was selected by the Society of Antiquaries of 
Scotland to deliver the Rhind lectures on archaeology, out of 



MURRAY, D.— MURRAY, LORD GEORGE

which grew his Handbook of Greek Archaeology (1892). In 
1894-1896 Dr Murray directed some excavations in Cyprus 
undertaken by means of a bequest of £2000 from Miss Emma 
Tournour Turner. The objects obtained are described and 
illustrated in Excavalions in Cyprus, published by the trustees 
of the museum in 1900. Among Dr Murray's other official 
publications are three folio volumes on Terracotta Sarcophagi, 
White Athenian Vases and Designs from Greek Vases. In 1898 
he wrote for the Portfolio a monograph on Greek bronzes, 
founded on lectures delivered at the Royal Academy in that 
year, and he contributed many articles on archaeology to 
standard publications. In recognition of his services to archaeo- 
logy he was made LL.D. of Glasgow University in 1887 and 
elected a corresponding member of the Berlin Academy of 
Sciences in 1900. He died in March 1904. 

MURRAY, DAVID (1840- ), Scottish painter, was born in 
Glasgow, and spent some years in commercial pursuits before 
he practised as an artist. He was elected an associate of the 
Royal Academy in 1891 and academician in 1905; and also 
became an associate of the Royal Scottish Academy and of 
the Royal Society of Painters in Water Colours, and a member 
of the Royal Scottish Water Colour Society. He is a landscape 
painter of distinction, and two of his pictures, " My Love is 
gone a-sailing " (1884) and " In the Country of Constable " 
(1903), have been bought for the National Gallery of British 
Art. " Young Wheat," painted in 1890, is one of his most 
noteworthy works. 

MURRAY, EUSTACE CLARE GRENVILLE (1824-1881), 
English journalist, was born in 1824, the natural son of the 2nd 
duke of Buckingham. Educated at Magdalen Hall (Hertford 
College), Oxford, he entered the diplomatic service through the 
influence of Lord ^Palmerston, and in 1851 joined the British 
. embassy at Vienna as attache. At the same time he agreed 
to act as Vienna correspondent of a London daily paper, a 
breach of the conventions of the British Foreign Office which 
cost him his post. In 1852 he was transferred to Hanover, 
and thence to Constantinople, and finally, in 1855, was made 
consul-general at Odessa. In 1868 he returned to England, 
and devoted himself to journalism. He contributed to the 
early numbers of Vanity Fair, and in 1869 founded a clever but 
abusive society paper, the Queen's Messenger. For a libel 
published in this paper Lord Carrington horsewhipped him 
on the doorstep of a London club. Murray was subsequently 
charged with perjury for denying on oath his authorship of the 
article. Remanded on bail, he escaped to Paris, where he 
subsequently lived, acting as correspondent of various London 
papers. In 1874 he helped Edmund Yates to found the World. 
Murray died at Passy on the 20th of December 1881. 

His score of books, several of which were translated into French 
and published in Paris, include French Pictures in English Chalk 
(1876-1878); The Roving Englishman in Turkey (1854); Men of the 
Second Empire (1872); Young Brown (1874); Sidelights on English 
Society (1881); and Under the Lens: Social Photographs (1885). 

MURRAY, LORD GEORGE (1694-1760), Scottish Jacobite 
general, fifth son of John, 1st duke of Atholl, by his first wife, 
Catherine, daughter of the 3rd duke of Hamilton, was born 
at Huntingtower, near Perth, on the 4th of October 1694. 
He joined the army in Flanders in June 171 2; in 171 5, contrary 
to their father's wishes, he and his brothers, the marquis of 
Tullibardine and Lord Charles Murray, joined the Jacobite rebels 
under the earl of Mar, each brother commanding a regiment of 
men of Atholl. Lord Charles was taken prisoner at Preston, 
but after the collapse of the rising Lord George escaped with 
Tullibardine to South Uist, and thence to France. In 1719 
Murray took part in the Jacobite attempt in conjunction with 
the Spaniards in the western highlands, under the command of 
Tullibardine and the earl marischal, which terminated in " the' 
affair of Glenshiel " on the 10th of June, when he was wounded 
while commanding the right wing of the Jacobites. After 
hiding for some months in the highlands he reached Rotter- 
dam in May 1720. There is no evidence for the statement that 
Murray served in the Sardinian army, and little is known of his 



life on the continent till 1724, when he returned to Scotland, 
where in the following year he was granted a pardon. The duke 
of Atholl died in 1724 and was succeeded in the title by his second 
son James, owing to the attainder of Tullibardine; and Lord 
George leased from his brother the old family property of 
Tullibardine in Strathearn, where he lived till 1745. 

On the eve of the Jacobite rising of 1745 the duke of Perth 
made overtures to Lord George Murray on behalf of the 
Pretender; but even after the landing of Charles Edward in 
Scotland in July, accompanied by Tullibardine, Murray's attitude 
remained doubtful. He accompanied his brother the duke to 
Crieff on the 21st of August to pay his respects to Sir John Cope, 
the commander of the government troops, and he permitted 
the duke to appoint him deputy-sheriff of Perthshire. It has 
been suggested that Murray acted with duplicity, but his 
hesitation was natural and genuine; and it was not till early in 
September, when Charles Edward was at Blair Castle, which had 
been vacated by the duke of Atholl on the prince's approach, 
that Murray decided to espouse the Stuart cause. He then 
wrote to his brother explaining that he did so for conscientious 
reasons, while realizing the risk of ruin it involved. On joining 
the Jacobite army Lord George received a commission as lieu- 
tenant-general, though the prince ostentatiously treated him 
with want of confidence; and he was flouted by the Irish adven- 
turers who were the Pretenderis trusted advisers. At Perth 
Lord George exerted himself with success to introduce discipline 
and organization in the army he was to command, and he gained 
the confidence of the highland levies, with whose habits and 
methods of fighting he was familiar. He also used his influence 
to prevent the exactions and arbitrary interference with civil 
rights which Charles was too ready to sanction on the advice Of 
others. At Prestonpans, on the 21st of September, Lord George, 
who led the Jacobite left wing in person, was practically com- 
mander-in-chief, and it was to his able generalship that the 
victory was mainly due. During the six weeks' occupation of 
Edinburgh he did useful work in the further organization and 
disciplining of the army. He opposed Charles's plan of invading 
England, and when his judgment was overruled he prevailed 
on the prince to march into Cumberland, which he knew to be 
favourable ground for highlander tactics, instead of advancing 
against General Wade, whose army was posted at Newcastle. 
He conducted the siege of Carlisle, but on the surrender of the 
town on the 14th of November he resigned his command on 
the ground that his authority had been insufficiently upheld by 
the prince, and he obtained permission to serve as a volunteer 
in the ranks of the Atholl levies. The dissatisfaction, however, 
of the army with the appointment of the duke of Perth to 
succeed him compelled Charles to reinstate Murray, who accord- 
ingly commanded the Jacobites in the march to Derby. Here 
on the 5th of December a council was held at which Murray 
urged the necessity for retreat, owing to the failure of the English 
Jacobites to support the invasion and the absence of aid from 
France. As Murray was supported by the council the retreat 
was ordered, to the intense chagrin of Charles, who never forgave 
him; but the failure of the enterprise was mainly chargeable 
to Charles himself, and it was not without justice that Murray's 
aide de camp, the chevalier Johnstone, declared that " had 
Prince Charles slept during the whole of the expedition, and 
allowed Lord George Murray to act for him according to his 
own judgment, he would have found the crown of Great Britain 
on his head when he awoke." Lord George commanded the 
rear-guard during the retreat; and this task, rendered doubly 
dangerous by the proximity of Cumberland in the rear and Wade 
on the flank, was made still more difficult by the incapacity 
and petulance of the Pretender. By a skilfully fought rear- 
guard action at Clifton Moor, Lord George enabled the army to 
reach Carlisle safely and without loss of stores or war material; 
and on the 3rd of January r746 the force entered Stirling, where 
they were joined by reinforcements from Perth. The prince 
laid siege to Stirling Castle, while Murray defeated General 
Hawley near Falkirk; but the losses of the Jacobites by sickness 
and desertion, and the approach of Cumberland, made retreat

MURRAY, JAMES- 



to the Highlands an immediate necessity, in which the prince 
was compelled to acquiesce; his resentment was such that he 
gave ear to groundless suggestions that Murray was a traitor, 
which the latter's failure to capture his brother's stronghold 
of Blair Castle did nothing to refute. 

In April 1746 the Jacobite army was in the neighbourhood 
of Inverness, and the prince decided to give battle to the duke 
of Cumberland. Charles took up a position on the left bank of 
the Nairn river at Culloden Moor, rejecting Lord George's Murray 
advice to select a much stronger position on the opposite bank. 
The battle of Culloden, where the Stuart cause was ruined, 
was fought on the 16th of April 1746. On the following day the 
duke of Cumberland intimated to his troops that " the public 
orders' of the rebels yesterday was to give us no quarter"; 
Hanoverian news-sheets printed what purported to be copies 
of such an order, and the historian James Ray and other con- 
temporary writers gave further currency to a calumny that has 
been repeated by modern authorities. Original copies of Lord 
George Murray's " orders at Culloden " are in existence, one of 
which is among Cumberland's own papers, while another was 
in the possession of Lord Hardwicke, the judge who tried the 
Jacobite peers in 1746, and they contain no injunction to refuse 
quarter. After the defeat Murray conducted a remnant of the 
Jacobite army to Ruthven, and prepared to organize further 
resistance. Prince Charles, however, had determined to aban- 
don the enterprise, and at Ruthven Lord George received an 
order dismissing him from the prince's service, to which he replied 
in a letter upbraiding Charles for his distrust and mismanage- 
ment. Charles's belief in the general's treachery was shared 
by several leading Jacobites, but there appears no ground for 
the suspicion. From the moment he threw in his lot with the 
exiled prince's cause Lord George Murray never deviated in his 
loyalty and devotion, and his generalship was deserving of the 
highest praise; but the discipline he enforced and jealousy of 
his authority made enemies of some of those to whom Charles 
was more inclined to listen than to the general who gave him 
sound but unwelcome advice. 

Murray escaped to the continent in December 1746, and was 
graciously received in Rome by the Old Pretender, who granted 
him a pension; but in the following year when he went to Paris 
Charles Edward refused to see him. Lord George lived at 
various places abroad until his death, which occurred at Medem- 
blik in Holland on the nth of October 1760. He married 
in 1728 Amelia, daughter and heiress of James Murray of 
Strowan and Glencarse, by whom he had three sons and two 
daughters. His eldest son John became 3rd duke of Atholl in 
1764; the two younger sons became lieutenant-general and 
vice-admiral respectively in the British service.

MURRAY, JAMES (c. 1710-1794), British governor of Canada, 
was a younger son of Alexander Murray, 4th Lord Elibank 
(d. 1736). Having entered the British army, he served with the 
15th Foot in the West Indies, the Netherlands and Brittany, and 
became lieutenant-colonel of this regiment by purchase in 1751. 
In 1757 he led his men to North America to take part in the 
war against France. He commanded a brigade at the siege of 
Louisburg, was one of Wolfe's three brigadiers in the expedition 
against Quebec, and commanded the left wing of the army in 
the famous battle in September 1759. After the British victory 
and the capture of the city, Murray was left in command of 
Quebec; having strengthened its fortifications and taken 
measures to improve the morale of his men, he defended it in 
April and May 1760 against the attacks of the French, who were 
soon compelled to raise the siege. The British troops had been 



-MURRAY, EARL OF 

decimated by disease, and it was only a remnant that Murray 
now led to join General Amherst at Montreal, and to be present 
when the last batch of French troops in Canada surrendered. 
In October 1760 he was appointed governor of Quebec, and he 
became governor of Canada after this country had been formally 
ceded to Great Britain in 1763. In this year he quelled a 
dangeious mutiny, and soon afterwards his alleged partiality for 
the interests of the French Canadians gave offence to the British 
settlers; they asked for his recall, and in 1766 he retired from his 
post. After an inquiry in the House of Lords, he was exonerated 
from the charges which had been brought against him. In 
1774 Murray was sent to Minorca as governor, and in 1781, 
while he was in charge of this island, he was besieged in Fort 
St Philip by a large force of French and Spaniards. After a 
stubborn resistance, which lasted nearly seven months, he was 
obliged to surrender the place; and on his return to England 
he was tried by a court-martial, at the instance of Sir William 
Draper, who had served under him in Minorca as lieutenant- 
governor. He was acquitted and he became a general in 1783. 
He died on the 18th of June 1794. Murray's only son was 
James Patrick Murray (1782-1834), a major-general and member 
of parliament. 

MURRAY, SIR JAMES AUGUSTUS HENRY (1837- ), 
British lexicographer, was born at Denholm, near Hawick, 
Roxburghshire, and after a local elementary education proceeded 
to Edinburgh, and thence to the university of London, where 
he graduated B.A. in 1873. Sir James Murray, who received 
honorary degrees from several universities, both British and 
foreign, was engaged in scholastic work for thirty years, from 
1855 to 1885, chiefly at Hawick and Mill Hill. During this time 
his reputation as a philologist was increasing, and he was 
assistant examiner in English at the University of London from 
1875 to 1879 and president of the Philological Society of London - 
from 1878 to 1880, and again from 1882 to 1884. It was in 
connexion with this society that he undertook the chief work 
of his life, the editing of the New English Dictionary ', based on 
materials collected by the society. These materials, which had 
accumulated since 1857, when the society first projected the 
publication of a dictionary on philological principles, amounted 
to an enormous quantity, of which an idea may be formed from 
the fact that Dr Fumivall sent in " some ton and three-quarters 
of materials which had accumulated under his roof." After 
negotiations extending over a considerable period, the contracts 
between the society, the delegates of the Clarendon Press, and 
the editor, were signed on the 1st of March 1879, and Murray 
began the examination and arrangement of the raw material, 
and the still more troublesome work of re-animating and main- 
taining the enthusiasm of " readers." In 1885 he removed from 
Mill Hill to Oxford, where his Scriptorium came to rank among 
the institutions of the University city. The first volume of 
the dictionary was printed at the Clarendon Press, Oxford, 
in 1888. A full account of its beginning and the manner of 
working up the materials will be found in Murray 's presidential 
address to the Philological Society in 1879, while reports of 
its progress are given in the addresses by himself and other 
presidents in subsequent years. In addition to his work as a 
philologist, Murray was a frequent contributor to the transac- 
tions of the various antiquarian and archaeological societies of 
which he is a member; and he wrote the article on the English 
language for this Encyclopaedia. In 1885 he received the 
honorary degree of M.A. from Baliiol College; he was an original 
fellow of the British Academy, and in 1908 he was knighted. 

MURRAY (or Moray), JAMES STUART, Earl of (c. 1531- 
1570), regent of Scotland, was an illegitimate son of James V. 
of Scotland by Margaret Erskine, daughter of John Erskine, 
earl of Mar. In 1538/he was appointed prior of the abbey of 
St Andrews in order that James V. might obtain possession of 
its funds. Educated at St Andrews University, he attacked, 
in September 1549, an English force which had made a descent 
on the Fife coast, and routed it with great slaughter. In 
addition to the priory of St Andrews, he received those also of 
Tittenweem and Macon in France, but manifested no vocation 



MURRAY, JOHN 



for a monastic life. The discourses of Knox, which he heard 
at Calder, won his approval, and shortly after the return of the 
reformer to Scotland in 1559, James Stuart left the party of the 
queen regent and joined the lords of the congregation, who 
resolved forcibly to abolish the Roman service. After the 
return of Queen Mary in 1561, he became her chief adviser, and 
his cautious firmness was for a time effectual in inducing her 
to adopt a policy of moderation towards the reformers. At the 
beginning of 1562 he was created earl of Murray, a dignity also 
held by George Gordon, earl of Huntly, who, however, had 
lost the queen's favour. Only a few days later he was made earl 
of Mar,* but as this title was claimed by John, Lord Erskine, 
Stuart resigned it and received a second grant of the earldom of 
Murray, Huntly by this time having been killed in battle. 
Henceforward he was known as the earl of Moray, the alternative 
Murray being a more modern and less correct variant. About 
this time the earl married Anne (d. 1583), daughter of William 
Keith, 1 st Earl Marischal. 

After the defeat and death of Huntly, the leader of the 
Catholic party, the policy of Murray met for a time with no 
obstacle, but he awakened the displeasure of the queen by his 
efforts in behalf of Knox when the latter was accused of high 
treason; and as he was also opposed to her marriage with 
Darnley, he was after that event declared an outlaw and took 
refuge in England. Returning to Scotland after the murder 
of Rizzio, he was pardoned by the queen. He contrived, 
however, to be away at the time of Darnley's assassination, 
and avoided the tangles of the marriage with Bothwell by going 
to France. After the abdication of Queen Mary at Lochleven, 
in July 1567, he was appointed regent of Scotland. When 
Mary escaped from Lochleven (May 2, 1 568), the duke of Chatel- 
herault and other Catholic nobles rallied to her standard, 
but Murray and the Protestant lords gathered their adherents, 
defeated her forces at Langside, near Glasgow (May 13, 1568), 
and compelled her to flee to England. Murray displayed 
promptness in baffling Mary's schemes, suppressed the border 
thieves, and ruled firmly, resisting the temptation to place the 
crown on his own head. He observed the forms of personal 
piety; possibly he shared the zeal of the reformers, while he 
moderated their bigotry. But he reaped the fruits of the 
conspiracies which led to the murders of Rizzio and Darnley. 
He amassed too great a fortune from the estates of the Church 
to be deemed a pure, reformer of its abuses. He pursued his 
sister with a calculated animosity which would not have spared 
her life had this been necessary to his end or been favoured by 
Elizabeth. The mode of producing the casket letters and 
the false charges added by Buchanan, deprive Murray of any 
claim to have been an honest accuser. His reluctance to charge 
Mary with complicity in the murder of Darnley was feigned, 
and his object was gained when he was allowed to table the 
accusation without being forced to prove it. Mary remained 
a captive under suspicion of the gravest guilt, while Murray 
ruled Scotland in her stead, supported by nobles who had taken 
part in the steps which ended in Bothwell's deed. During the 
year between his becoming regent and his death several events 
occurred for which he has been censured, but which were 
necessary for his security: the betrayal to Elizabeth of the duke 
of Norfolk and of the secret plot for the liberation of Mary; the 
imprisonment of the earl of Northumberland, who after the 
failure of his rising in the north of England had taken refuge 
in Scotland; and the charge brought against Maitland of Leth- 
ington of complicity in Darnley's murder. Lethington was 
committed to custody, but was rescued by Kirkaldy of Grange, 
who held the castle of Edinburgh, and while there " the chame- 
leon," as Buchanan named Maitland in his famous invective, 
gained over those in "the castle, including Kirkaldy. Murray 
was afraid to proceed with the charge on the day of trial, while 
Kirkaldy and Maitland held the castle, which became the 
stronghold of the deposed queen's party. It has been suspected 
that Maitland and Kirkaldy were cognizant of the design of 
Hamilton of Bothwellhaugh to murder Murray, for he had been 
with them in the castle. This has been ascribed to private 



41 

vengeance for the ill-treatment of his wife; but the feud of the 
Hamiltons with the regent is the most reasonable explanation. 
As he rode through Linlithgow Murray was shot on the 21st of 
January 1570 from a window by Hamilton,- who had made careful 
preparation for the murder and his own escape. He was buried 
in the south aisle of St Giles Cathedral, Edinburgh, amid general 
mourning. Knox preached the sermon and Buchanan furnished 
the epitaph, both panegyrics. The elder of his two daughters, 
Elizabeth, married James Stuart (d. 1592), son of James, 1st 
Lord Doune, who succeeded to the earldom of Murray in right 
of his wife. 

The materials for the life of Murray are found in the records and 
documents of the time, prominent among which are the various 
Calendars of State Papers. Mention must also be made of the many 
books which treat of Mary, Queen of Scots, and of the histories of 
the time — especially J. A. Froude, History of England, and Andrew 
Lang, History of Scotland, 

MURRAY, JOHN, the name for several generations of a great 
firm of London publishers, founded by John McMurray (1745- 
x 793)» a native of Edinburgh and a retired lieu tenant of marines, 
who in 1768 bought the book business of William Sandby in 
Fleet Street, and, dropping the Scottish prefix, called himself 
John Murray. He was one of the twenty original proprietors 
of the Morning Chronicle, and started the monthly English 
Review (1 783-1 796). Among his publications were Mitford's 
Greece, Langhorne's Plutarch's Lives, and the first part of Isaac 
DTsraeli's Curiosities of Literature. He died on the 6th of 
November 1793. 

John Murray (2) (1778-1843), his son, was then fifteen. 
During his minority the business was conducted by Samuel 
Highley, who was admitted a partner, but in 1803 the partner- 
ship was dissolved. Murray soon began to show the courage 
in literary speculation which earned for him later the name 
given him by Lord Byron of " the Anak of publishers." In 
1807 he took a share with Constable in publishing Marmion, 
and became part owner of the Edinburgh Review, although with 
the help of Canning he launched in opposition the Quarterly 
Review (Feb. 1809), with William Gifford as its editor, and Scott, 
Canning, Southey, Hookham Frere and John Wilson Croker 
among its earliest contributors. Murray was closely connected 
with Constable, but, to his distress, was compelled in 1813 to 
break this association on account of Constable's business methods, 
which, as he foresaw, led to disaster. In 181 1 the first two 
cantos of Childe Harold were brought to Murray by R. C. Dallas, 
to whom Byron had presented them. Murray paid Dallas 
500 guineas for the copyright. In 181 2 he bought the pub- 
lishing business of William Miller (1 760-1844), and migrated to 
50, Albemarle Street. Literary London flocked to his house, and 
Murray became the centre of the publishing world. It was in 
his drawing-room that Scott and Byron first met, and here, in 
1824, after the death of Lord Byron, the MS. of his memoirs, 
considered by Gifford unfit for publication, was destroyed. 
A close friendship existed between Byron and his publisher, 
but for political reasons business relations ceased after the 
publication of the 5th canto of Don Juan. Murray paid Byron 
some £20,000 for his various poems. To Thomas Moore he 
gave nearly £5000 for writing the life of Byron, and to Crabbe 
£3000 for Tales of the Hall. He died on the 27th of June 1843. 

His son, John Murray (3) (1808-1892), inherited much of 
his business tact and judgment. " Murray's Handbooks " for 
travellers were issued under his editorship, and he himself wrote 
several volumes (see his article on the " Handbooks " in Murray's 
Magazine, November 1889). He published many books of 
travel; also Campbell's Lives of the Chancellors, The Speaker's 
Commentary, Smith's Dictionaries; and works by Hallam, 
Gladstone, Lyell, Layard, Dean Stanley, Borrow, Darwin, Living- 
stone and Samuel Smiles. He died on the 2nd of April 1892, 
and was succeeded by his eldest son, John Murray (4) (b. 1851), 
under whom, in association with his brother, A. H. Hallam 
Murray, the firm was continued.

MURRAY, JOHN (1778-1820), Scottish chemist, was born at 
Edinburgh in 1778 and died there on the 22nd of July 1820. 
He graduated M.D. at St Andrews in 1814, and attained some 
reputation as a lecturer on chemistry and materia medica. He 
was an opponent of Sir Humphry Davy's theory of chlorine, 
supporting the view that the substance contained oxygen, and 
it was in the course of experiments made to disprove his argu- 
ments that Dr John Davy discovered phosgene or carbonyl 
chloride. He was a diligent writer of textbooks, including 
Elements of Chemistry (1801); Elements of Materia Medica and 
Pharmacy (1804);^ System of Chemistry (1806), and (anony- 
mously) A Comparative View of the HtUtonian and Neptunian 
Systems of Geology. He is sometimes confused with another 
John Murray (1 786-1 851), a popular lecturer at mechanics' 
institutes. The two men carried on a dispute about the inven- 
tion of a miners' safety lamp in the Phil. Mag. for 181 7. 

MURRAY, SIR JOHN (1841- ), British geographer and 
naturalist, was born at Coburg, Ontario, Canada, on the 
3rd of March 1841, and after some years' local schooling studied 
in Scotland and on the Continent. He was then engaged for 
some years in natural history work at Bridge of Allan. In 
1868 he visited Spitsbergen on a whaler, and in 1872, when the 
voyage of the " Challenger " was projected, he was appointed 
one of the naturalists to the expedition. At the conclusion of 
the voyage he was made principal assistant in drawing up the 
scientific results, and in 1882 he became editor of the Reports, 
which were completed in 1896. He compiled a summary of the 
results, and was part-author of the Narrative of the Cruise and of 
the Report on Deep-sea Deposits. He also published numerous 
important papers on oceanography and marine biology. In 
1898 he was made K.C.B., and the received many distinctions 
from the chief scientific societies of the world. Apart from his 
work in connexion with the " Challenger " Reports, he went in 
1880 and 1882 on expeditions to explore the Faeroe Channel, 
and between 1882 and 1894 was the prime mover in various 
biological investigations in Scottish waters. In 1897, with 
the generous financial assistance of Mr Laurence Pullar and a 
staff of specialists, he began a bathymetrical survey of the 
fresh-water lochs of Scotland, the results of which, with a 
fine series of illustrations and maps, were published in 1910 
in six volumes. He took a leading part in the expedition 
which started in April 1910 for the physiological and biological 
investigation of the North Atlantic Ocean on the Norwegian 
vessel " Michael Sars." 

MURRAY, LINDLEY (1745-1826), Anglo-American gram- 
marian, was born at Swatara, Pennsylvania, on the 22nd of 
April 1745. His father, a Quaker, was a leading New York 
merchant. At the age of fourteen he was placed in his father's 
office, but he ran away to a school in Burlington, New Jersey. 
He was brought back to New York, but his arguments against 
a commercial career prevailed, and he was allowed to study 
law. On being called to the bar he practised successfully in 
New York. In 1783 he was able to retire, and in 1784 he left 
America for England. Settling at Holgate, near York, he 
devoted the rest of his life to literary pursuits. His first book 
was Power of Religion on the Mind (1787). In 1795 he issued 
his Grammar of the English Language. This was followed, 
among other analogous works, by English Exercises, and the 
English Reader. These books passed through several editions, 
and the Grammar was the standard textbook for fifty years 
throughout England and America. Lindley Murray died on 
the 16th of January 1826.

(partly autobiographical), by Elizabeth Frank (1826); Life of 
- Murray, by W. H. Egle (New York, 1885). 

MURRAY (or Moray), SIR ROBERT (c. 1600-1673), one' of 

the founders of the Royal Society, was the son of Sir Robert 

, Murray of Craigie, Ayrshire, and was born about the beginning 

of the 17th century. In early life he served in the French army, 

•and, winning the favour of Richelieu, rose to the rank of colonel. 



MURRAY, J.— MURREE 



On the outbreak of the Civil War he returned to Scotland and 
collected recruits for the royal cause. The triumph of Ciomwell 
compelled him for a time to return to France, but he took part 
in the Scottish insurrection in favour of Charles II. in 1650, and 
was named lord justice clerk and a privy councillor. These 
appointments, which on account of the overthrow of the royal 
cause proved to be at the time only nominal, were confirmed at 
the Restoration in 1660. Soon after this Sir Robert Murray 
began to take a prominent part in the deliberations of a club 
instituted in London for the discussion of natural science, or, 
as it was then called, the '* new philosophy." When it was 
proposed to obtain a charter for the society he undertook to 
interest the king in the matter, the result being that on the 
15th of July 1662 the club was incorporated by charter under 
the designation of the Royal Society. • Murray was its first 
president. He died in June 1673. 

MURRAY, the largest river in Australia. It rises in the 
Australian Alps in 3 6° 40' S. and 147 E., and flowing north-west 
skirts the borders of New South Wales and. Victoria until it 
passes into South Australia, shortly after which it bends south- 
ward into Lake Alexandrina, a shallow lagoon, whence it makes 
its way to the sea at Encounter Bay by a narrow opening at 
35° 35* S. and 138 55' E. Near its source the Murray Gates, 
precipitous rocks, tower above it to the height of 3000 ft;; 
and the earlier part of its course is tortuous and uneven. 
Farther on it loses so much by evaporation in some parts as to 
become a series of pools. Its length till it debouches into Lake 
Alexandrina is 11 20 m., its average breadth in summer is 240 ft., 
its average depth about 16 ft.; and it drains an area of about 
270,000 sq. m. For small steamers it is navigable as far as 
Albury. Periodically it overflows, causing wide inundations. 
The principal tributaries of the Murray are those from New 
South Wales, including the Edward River, the united streams of 
the Murrumbidgee and Lachlan, and the Darling or Callewatta. 
In 1829 Captain Sturt traced the Murrumbidgee River till it 
debouched into the Murray, which he followed down to Lake 
Alexandrina, but he was compelled, after great hardships, to 
return without discovering its mouth. In 1831 Captain Barker, 
while attempting to discover this, was murdered by the natives. 

MURRAY COD (Oligorus macquariensis) , one of the largest 
of the numerous fresh-water Perciform fishes of Australia, and 
the most celebrated for its excellent flavour. It belongs to 
the family Serranidae. Its taxonomic affinities He in the direc- 
tion of the perch and not of the cod family. The shape of the 
body is that of a perch, and the dorsal fin consists of a spinous

and rayed portion, the number of spines being eleven. The 
length of the spines varies with age, old individuals having 
shorter spines — that is, a lower dorsal fin. The form of the 
head and the dentition also resemble those of a perch, but 
none of the bones of the head has a serrated margin. The 
scales are small. The colour varies in different localities; it 
is generally brownish, with a greenish tinge and numerous 
small dark green spots. As implied by the name, this fish has 
its headquarters in the Murray River and its tributaries, but it 
occurs also in the northern parts of New South Wales. It is the 
most important food fish of these rivers, and is said to attain 
a length of more than 3 ft. and a weight of 1 20 lb. 

MURREE, a town and sanatorium of British India, in the 
Rawalpindi district of the Punjab, 7517 ft. above the sea. about 
five hours' journey by cart-road from Rawalpindi town, and 
the starting-point for Kashmir. The houses are built on the

summit and sides of an irregular ridge, and command magnifi- 
cent views over forest-clad hills and deep valleys, studded with 
villages and cultivated fields, with the snow-covered peaks of 
Kashmir in the background. The population in 1901 was 1844;^ 
but these figures omit the summer visitors, who probably number 
10,000. The garrison generally consists of three mountain 
batteries. Since 1877 the summer offices of the provincial 
government have been transferred to Simla. The Murree 
brewery, one of the largest in India, is the chief industrial 
establishment. The Lawrence Military Asylum for the children 
of European soldiers is situated here. 

MURSHIDABAD, or Moorsheedabad, a town and district 
of British India, in the Presidency division of Bengal. The 
administrative headquarters of the district are at Berhampur. 
The town of Murshidabad is on the left bank of the Bhagirathi 
or old sacred channel of the Ganges. Pop. (1001), 15,168. 
The city of Murshidabad was the latest Mahommedan capital 
of Bengal. In 1704 the nawab Murshid Kulia Khan changed 
the seat of government from Dacca to Maksudabad, which he 
called after his own name. The great family of Jagat Seth 
maintained their position as state bankers at Murshidabad 
from generation to generation. Even after the conquest of 
Bengal by the British, Murshidabad remained for some time 
the seat of administration. Warren Hastings removed the 
supreme civil and criminal courts to Calcutta in 1772, but in 
1775 the latter court was brought back to Murshidabad again. 
In 1 790, under Lord Cornwallis, the entire revenue and judicial 
staffs were fixed at Calcutta. The town is still the residence 
of the nawab, who ranks as the first nobleman of the province 
with the style of nawab bahadur of Murshidabad, instead of 
nawab nazim of Bengal. His palace, dating from 1837, is a 
magnificent building in Italian style. The city is crowded with 
other palaces, mosques, tombs, and gardens, and retains such 
industries as carving in ivory, gold and silver embroidery, and 
silk-weaving. A college is maintained for the education of the 
nawab's family. 

The District of Murshidabad has an area of 2143 sq. m. 
It is divided into two nearly equal portions by the Bhagirathi, 
the ancient channel of the Ganges. The tract to the west, 
known as the Rarh, consists of hard clay and nodular limestone. 
The general level is high, but interspersed with marshes and 
seamed hy hill torrents. The Bagri or eastern half belongs to 
alluvial plains of eastern Bengal. There are few permanent 
swamps; but the whole country is low-lying, and liable to annual 
inundation. In the north-west are a few small detached hillocks, 
said to be of basaltic formation. Pop. (1901), 1,333,184, show- 
ing an increase of 6-6% in the decade. The principal industry 
is that of silk, formerly of much importance, and now revived 
with government assistance. A narrow-gauge railway crosses 
the district, from the East Indian line at Nalhati to Azimganj 
on the Bhagirathi, the home of many rich Jain merchants; and 
a branch of the Eastern Bengal railway has been opened. 

MUS, the name of a Roman family of the plebeian Decian 
gens. (1) Publius Decius Mus won his first laurels in the 
Samnite War, when in 343 B.C., while serving as tribune of the 
soldiers, he rescued the Roman main arm/ frdm an apparently 
hopeless position (Livy vii. 34). In 340, as consul with T. 
Manlius Torquatus as colleague, he commanded in the Latin 
War. The decisive battle was fought near Mt Vesuvius. 
The consuls, in consequence of a dream, had agreed that the 
general whose troops first gave way should devote himself to 
destruction, and so ensure victory. The left wing under Decius 
became disordered, whereupon, repeating after the chief pontiff 
the solemn formula of self-devotion he dashed into the ranks 
of the Latins, and met his death (Livy viii. 9). (2) His son, 
also called Publius, consul for the fourth time in 295, followed 
the example of his father at the battle of Sentinum, when the 
left wing which he commanded was shaken by the Gauls (Livy 
x. 28). The story of the elder Decius is regarded by Mommsen 
as an unhistorical " double tte " of what is related on better 
authority of the son. 

MUSAEUS, the name of three Greek poets. (1) The first was 



a mythical seer and priest, the pupil or son of Orpheus, who was 
said to have been the founder of priestly poetry in Attica. 
According to Pausanias (i. 25) he was buried on the Museum hill, 
south-west of the Acropolis. He composed dedicatory and 
purificatory hymns and prose treatises, and oracular responses. 
These were collected and arranged in the time of Peisistratus 
by Onomacritus, who added interpolations. The mystic and 
oracular verses and customs of Attica, especially of Eleusis, 
are connected with his name (Herod, vii. 6; viii. 96; ix. 43). 
A Titanomachia and Theogonia are also attributed to him 
(G. Kinkel, Epicorum graecorum fragmenta, 1878). (2) The 
second was an Ephesian attached to the court of the kings of 
Pergamum, who wrote a Perseis, and poems on Eumenes and 
At talus (Suldas, s.v.). (3) The third (called Grammaticus in 
all the MSS.) is of uncertain date, but probably belongs to the 
beginning of the 6th century a.d., as his style and metre are 
evidently modelled after Nonnus. He must have lived before 
Agathias (530-582) and is possibly to be identified with the 
friend of Procopius whose poem (340 hexameter lines) on the 
story of Hero and Leander is by far the most beautiful of the age 
(editions by F. Passow, 1810; G. H. Schafer, 1825; C. Dilthey, 
1874). The little love-poem Alpheus and Aretkusa (AnthoL pal. 
ix. 362) is also ascribed to Musaeus. 

MUS A KHEL, a Pa than tribe on the Dera Ghazi Khan border 
of the Punjab province of India. They are of Kakar origin, 
numbering 4670 fighting men. They enter British territory 
by the Vihowa Pass, and carry on an extensive trade, but are 
not dependent on India for the necessaries of life. They are 
a peaceful and united race, and have been friendly to the British, 
but at enmity with the Khetrans and the Baluch tribes to the 
south of their country. In 1879 the Musa Khels and other 
Pathan tribes to the number of 5000 made a demonstration 
against Vihowa, but the town was reinforced and they dispersed. 
In 1884 they were punished, together with the Kakars, by the 
Zhob Valley Expedition. 

MUSAUS, JOHANN KARL AUGUST (1735-1787), German 
author, was born on the 29th of March 1735 at Jena, studied 
theology at the university, and would have become the pastor 
of a parish but for the resistance of some peasants, who objected 
that he had been known to dance. In 1760 to 1762 he published 
in three volumes his first work, Grandison der Zweite, afterwards 
(in 1781-1782) rewritten and issued with a new title, Der deutsche 
Grandison. The object of this book was to satirize Samuel 
Richardson's hero, who had many sentimental admirers in 
Germany. In 1 763 Musa us was made master of the court pages 
at Weimar, and in 1769 he became professor at the Weimar 
gymnasium. His second book — Physiognomische Reisen — did not 
appear until 1 778-1 779. It was directed against Lavater, and 
attracted much favourable attention. In 1782 to 1786 he 
published his best work V olksmUrchen der Deutscken. Even 
in this series of tales, the substance of which Musa us collected 
among the people, he could not refrain from satire. The stories, 
therefore, lack the simplicity of genuine folk-lore. In 1785 
was issued Frcund Heins Erscheinungen in Holbeins Manier by 
J. R. Schellenberg, with explanations in prose and verse by 
Musaus. A collection of stories entitled Straussfedern, of which 
a volume appeared in 1787, Musaus was prevented from com- 
pleting by his death on the 28th of October 1787. 

The Volksmarchen have been frequently reprinted (Dusseldorf, 
1903, &c). They were translated into French in 1844, and three 
of the stories are included in Carlyle's German Romance (1827); 
Musaus's Nachgeiassene Serif ten were edited by his relative, A. von 
Kotzebue (1791). See M. Muller, /. K. A. Musaus (1867), and an 
essay by A. Stern in Beitrage zur Literalurgesckichte des 18. Jakr- 
hunderts (1893). 

MUSCAT, Muskat or Maskat, a town on the south-east 
coast of Arabia, capital of the province of Oman. Its value 
as a naval base is derived from its position, which commands 
the entrance to the Persian Gulf. The town of Gwadar, the 
chief port of Makran, belongs to Muscat, and by arrangement 
with the sultan the British occupy that port with a telegraph 
station of the Indo- Persian telegraph service. An Indian 
political residency is established at Muscat. In geographical

position it is isolated from the interior of the continent. The 
mountains rise behind it in a rugged wall, across which no road 
exists. It is only from Matrah, a northern suburb shut off by 
an intervening spur which reaches to the sea, that land com- 
munication with the rest of Arabia can be maintained. Both 
Muscat and Matrah are defended from incursions on the land- 
ward side by a wall with towers at intervals. Muscat rose to 
importance with the Portuguese occupation of the Persian Gulf, 
and is noted for the extent of Portuguese ruins about it. Two 
lofty forts, of which the most easterly is called Jalali and the 
western Merani, occupy the summits of hills on either side the 
cove overlooking the town; and beyond them on the seaward 
side are two smaller defensive works called Sirat. All these 
are ruinous. A low sandy isthmus connects the rock and 
fortress of Jalali with the mainland, and upon this isthmus stands 
the British residency. The sultan's palace is a three-storeyed 
building near the centre of the town, a relic of Portuguese 
occupation, called by the Arabs El Jereza, a corruption of 
Igrezia (church). This term is probably derived from the chapel 
once attached to the buildings which formed the Portuguese 
governor's residence and factory. The bazaar is insignificant, 
and its most considerable trade appears to be in a sweetmeat 
prepared from the gluten of maize. Large quantities of dates 
are also exported. 

History. — The early history of Muscat is the history of Portu- 
guese ascendancy in the Persian Gulf. When Albuquerque first 
burnt the place after destroying Karyat in 1508, Kalhat was 
the chief port of the coast and Muscat was comparatively 
unimportant. Kalhat was subsequently sacked and burnt, the 
great Arab mosque being destroyed, before Albuquerque returned 
to his ships, " giving many thanks to our Lord." From that 
date, through 114 years of Portuguese ascendancy, Muscat was 
held as a naval station and factory during a period of local 
revolts, Arab incursions, and Turkish invasion by sea; but it 
was not till 1622, when the Portuguese lost Hormuz, that Muscat 
became the headquarters of their fleet and the most important 
place held by them on the Arabian coast. In 1650 the Portu- 
guese were finally expelled from Oman. Muscat had been 
reduced previously by the humiliating terms imposed upon the 
garrison by the imam of Oman after a siege in 1648. For five 
years the Persians occupied Oman, but they disappeared in 
1 741. Under the great ruler of Oman, Said ibn Sultan (1804- 
1856), the fortunes of Muscat attained their zenith; but on his 
death, when his kingdom was divided and the African possessions 
were parted from western Arabia, Muscat declined. In 1883- 
1884, when Turki was sultan, the town was unsuccessfully 
besieged by the Indabayin and Rehbayin tribes, led by Abdul 
Aziz, the brother of Turki. In 1885 Colonel Miles, resident at 
Muscat, made a tour through Oman, following the footsteps of 
Wellsted in 1835, and confirmed that traveller's report of 
the fertility and wealth of the province. In 1898 the French 
acquired the right to use Muscat as a coaling station.

MUSCATINE, a city and the county-seat of Muscatine county, 
Iowa, U.S.A., on the Mississippi river (here crossed by a wagon 
bridge), at the apex of the " great bend," in the south-east part 
of the state. Pop. (1890), 11,454; (1900), 14,073, of whom 
2352 were foreign-born; (igio census) 16,178. It is served 
by the Chicago Milwaukee & Saint Paul, the Chicago Rock 
Island & Pacific, and the Muscatine North & South railways. 
It is built on high rocky bluffs, and is the centre of a pearl- 
button industry introduced in 1891 by J. F. Boepple, a German, 
the buttons being made from the shells of the fresh-water 
mussel found in the neighbourhood; and there are other manu- 
factures. Coal is mined in the vicinity, and near the city are 
latge market-gardens, the water-melons growing on Muscatine 
Island (below the city) and sweet potatoes being their most 
important products. The municipality owns and operates the 
waterworks. Muscatine began as a trading-post in 1833. It 



was laid out in 1836, incorporated as a town under the name 
of Bloomington in 1839, and first chartered as a city, under its 
present name, in 185 1. 

MUSCHELKALK, in geology, the middle member of the 
"German Trias. It consists of a series of calcareous, marly 
and dolomitic beds which lie conformably between the Bunter 
and Keuper formations. The name Muschelkalk (Fr., calcaire 
coquillier; conchylien, formation of D'Orbigny) indicates a 
characteristic feature in this series, viz. the frequent occurrence 
of lenticular banks composed of fossil shells, remarkable in the 
midst of a singularly barren group. In its typical form the 
Muschelkalk is practically restricted to the German region 
and its immediate neighbourhood; it is found in Thuringia, 
Harz, Franconia, Hesse, Swabia. and the Saar and Alsace 
districts. Northward it extends into Silesia, Poland and Heligo- 
land. Representatives are found in the Alps, west and south 
of the Vosges, in Moravia, near Toulon and Montpellier, 
in Spain and Sardinia; in Rumania, Bosnia, Dalmatia, and 
beyond this into Asia in the Himalayas, China, Australia, 
California, and in North Africa (Constantine). From the nature 
of the deposits, as well as from the impoverished fauna, the 
Muschelkalk of the type area was probably laid down within 
a land-locked sea which, in the earlier portion of its existence, 
had only imperfect communications with the more open waters 
of the period. The more remote representatives of the formation 
were of course deposited in diverse conditions, and are only to 
be correlated through the presence of some of the Muschelkalk 
fossils. 

In the " German " area the Muschelkalk is from 250-350 ft. 
thick; it is readily divisible into three groups, of which the 
upper and lower are pale thin-bedded limestones with greenish- 
grey marls, the middle group being mainly composed of 
gypsiferous and saliniferous marls with dolomite. The Lower 
Muschelkalk consists, from below upwards, of the following 
rocks, the ochreous Wellen Dolomit, lower Wellen Kalk, upper 
Wellen Kalk (so called on account of the wavy character of the 
bedding) with beds of " Schaumkalk " (a porous cellular lime- 
stone), and Oolite and the Orbicularis beds (with Myophoria 
orbicularis). In the Saar and Alsace districts and north Eifel, 
these beds take on a sandy aspect, the " Muschelsandstein." 
The Middle Muschelkalk or Anhydrite group, as already indi- 
cated, consists mainly of marls and dolomites with beds of 
anhydrite, gypsum and salt. The salt beds are worked at 
Hall, Friedrichshall, Heilbronn, Stettin and Erfurt. It is from 
this division that many of the mineral springs of Thuringia and 
south Germany obtain their saline contents. The cellular 
nature of much of the dolomite has given rise to the term 
" Zellendolomit." The Upper Muschelkalk (Hauptmusckelkalk, 
Friedrichshallkalk of von Alberti) consists of regular beds of 
shelly limestone alternating with beds of marl. The lower 
portion or " Trochitenkalk " is often composed entirely of the 
fragmentary stems of Encrinus liliiformis; higher up come the 
" Nodosus " beds with Cer allies compressus, C. nodosus, and 
C. semipartitus in ascending order. In Swabia and Franconia 
the highest beds are platy dolomites with Tringonodus Sander- 
gensis and the crustacean Bairdia. Stylolites are common in 
all the Muschelkalk limestones. The Alpine Muschelkalk differs 
in many respects from that of the type area, and shows a closer 
relationship with the Triassic Mediterranean sea; the more 
important local phases will be found tabulated in the article 
Trias. 

In addition to the fossils mentioned above, the following are 
Muschelkalk forms: Terebratulina vulgaris, Spirijerina Mantzeli 
and 5. hirsute, Myophoria vulgaris, Rhynchotites htrundo f Ceratites 
Munsteri, Ptychites studeri, Balalonites balatonicus, Aspidura scutel- 
lata f Daonella Lommeli, and in the Alpine region several rock- 
forming Algae, BactryUium, Gyroporclla, Diplopora, &c.

MUSCLE AND NERVE (Physiology)} Among the properties 
of living material there is one, widely though not universally 
present in it, which forms the pre-eminent characteristic of 

l The anatomy of the muscles is dealt with under Muscular 
System, and of the nerves under Nerve and Nervous System. 



MUSCLE AND NERVE

muscular cells. This property is the liberation of some of 
the energy contained in the chemical compounds of the cells 

in such a way as to give mechanical work. The 

mechanical work is obtained by movement resulting 
from a change, it is supposed, in the elastic tension of the 
framework of the living cell. In the fibrils existing in the 
cell a sudden alteration of elasticity occurs, resulting in an 
increased tension on the points of attachment of the cell to the 
neighbouring elements of the tissue in which the cell is placed. 
These yield under the strain, and tne cell shortens between 
those points of its attachment. This shortening is called 

contraction. But the volume of the cell is not 
binty*^' a PP rec i a °ly altered, despite the change of its shape, 

for its one diameter increases in proportion as its 
other is diminished. The manifestations of contractility by 
muscle are various in mode. By tonic contraction is meant 
a prolonged and equable state of tension which yields under 
analysis no element of intermittent character. This is mani- 
fested by the muscular walls of the hollow viscera and of the 
heart, where it is the expression of a continuous liberation of 
energy in process in the muscular tissue, the outcome of the 
latter's own intrinsic life, and largely independent of any con- 
nexion with the nervous system. The muscular wall of the 
blood-vessels also exhibits tonic contraction, which, however, 
seems to be mainly traceable to a continual excitation of the 
muscle cells by nervous influence conveyed to them along their 
nerves, and originating in the great vaso motor centre in the bulb. 
In the ordinary striped muscles of the skeletal musculature, e.g. 
gastrocnemius j tonic contraction obtains; but this, like the last 
mentioned, is not autochthonous in the muscles themselves; it 
is indirect and neural^ and appears to be maintained reflexly. 
The receptive organs of the muscular sense and of the semi- 
circular canals are to be regarded as the sites of origin of this 
reflex tonus of the skeletal muscles. Striped muscles possessing 
an autochthonous tonus appear to be the various sphincter 
muscles. 

Another mode of manifestation of contractility by muscles 
is the rhythmic. A tendency to rhythmic contraction seems dis- 
coverable in almost all muscles. In some it is very marked, for 
example in some viscera, the spleen, the bladder, the ureter, the 
uterus, the intestine, and especially in the heart. In several of 
these it appears not unlikely that the recurrent explosive libera- 
tions of energy in the muscle tissue are not secondary to recurrent 
explosions in nerve cells, but are attributable to decompositions 
arising sua sponte in the chemical substances of the muscle cells 
themselves in the course of their living. Even small strips of 
the muscle of the heart, if taken immediately after the death of 
the animal, continue, when kept moist and warm and supplied 
with oxygen, to " beat " rhythmically for hours. Rhythmic 
contraction is also characteristic of certain groups of skeletal 
muscles, e.g. the respiratory. In these the rhythmic activity is, 
however, clearly secondary to rhythmic discharges of the nerve 
cells constituting the respiratory centre in the bulb. Such 
discharges descend the nerve fibres of the spinal cord, and through 
the intermediation of various spinal nerve cells excite the 
respiratory muscles through their motor nerves. A form of 
contraction intermediate in character between the tonic and 
the rhythmic is met in the auricle of the heart of the toad. There 
slowly successive phases of increased and of diminished tonus 
regularly alternate, and upon them are superposed the rhythmic 
" beats " of the pulsating heart. 

" The beat," i.e. the short-lasting explosive contraction of 
the heart muscle, can be elicited by a single, even momentary, 
application of a stimulus, e.g. by an induction shock. Similarly, 
such a single stimulus elicits from a skeletal muscle a single 
" beat," or, as it is termed, a " twitch." In the heart muscle 
during a brief period after each beat, that is, after each 
single contraction of the rhythmic series, the muscle becomes 
inexcitable. It cannot then be excited to contract by any 
agent, though the inexcitable period is more brief for strong 
than for weak 'stimuli. But in the skeletal, voluntary or 
striped muscles a second stimulus succeeding a previous so 



Excit* 
ability. 



quickly as to fall even during the continuance of the contraction 
excited by a first, elicits a second contraction. This second 
contraction starts from whatever phase of previous contraction 
the muscle may have reached at the time. A third stimulus 
excites a third additional contraction, a fourth a fourth, and so 
on. The increments of contraction become, however, less and 
less, until the succeeding stimuli serve merely to maintain, not 
to augment, the existing degree of contraction. We arrive thus 
by synthesis at a summation of " beats " or of simple contrac- 
tions in the compound, or " tetanic," or summed contraction of 
the skeletal muscles. The tetanic or summed contractions are 
more extensive than the simple, both in space and time, and 
liberate more energy, both as mechanical work and heat. The 
tension developed by their means in the muscle is many times 
greater than that developed by a simple twitch. 

Muscle cells respond by changes in their activity to changes 
in their environment, and thus are said to be " excitable." 
They are, however, less excitable than are the nerve 
cells which innervate them. The change which 
excites them is termed a stimulus. The least 
stimulus which suffices to excite is known as the stimulus of 
threshold value. In the case of the heart muscle this threshold 
stimulus evokes a beat as extensive as does the strongest 
stimulus; that is, the intensity of the stimulus, so long as it 
is above threshold value, is not a function of the amount of the 
muscular response. But in the ordinary skeletal muscles the 
amount of the muscular contraction is for a short range of 
quantities of stimulus (of above threshold value) proportioned 
to the intensity of the stimulus and increases with it. A value 
of stimulus, however, is soon reached which evokes a maximal 
contraction. Further increase of contraction does not follow 
further increase of the intensity »of the stimulus above that 
point. 

Just as in a nerve fibre, when excited by a localized stimulus, 
the excited state spreads from the excited point to the adjacent 
unexcited ones, so in muscle the " contraction," when excited 
at a point, spreads to the adjacent uncontracted parts. Both 
in muscle and in nerve this spread is termed conduction. 
It is propagated along the muscle fibres of the skeletal muscles 
at a rate of about 3 metres per second. In the heart muscle 
it trayels much more slowly. The disturbance travels as a 
wave of contraction, and the whole extent of the wave-like 
disturbance measures in ordinary muscles much more than the 
whole length of any single muscle fibre. That the excited state 
spreads only to previously unexcited portions of the muscle 
fibre shows that even in the skeletal variety of muscle there 
exists, though only for a very brief time, a period of inexcitability. 
The duration of this period is about -$fas oi a second in skeletal 
muscle. 

When muscle that has remained inactive for some time is 
excited by a series of single and equal stimuli succeeding at 
intervals too prolonged to cause summation the succeeding 
contractions exhibit progressive increase up to a certain degree. 
The tenth contraction usually exhibits the culmination of this 
so-called " staircase effect." The explanation may lie in the 
production of CO2 in the muscle. That substance, in small 
doses, favours the contractile power of muscle. The muscle 
is a machine for utilizing the energy contained in its own chemical 
compounds. It is not surprising that the chemical substances 
produced in it by the decomposition of its living material should 
not be of a nature indifferent for muscular life. We find that 
if the series of excitations of the muscle be prolonged beyond 
the short stage of initial improvement, the contractions, after 
being well maintained for a time, later decline in force and 
speed, and ultimately dwindle even to vanishing point. This 
decline is said to be due to muscular fatigue. The muscle 
recovers on being allowed to rest unstimulated for a while, 
and more quickly on being washed with an innocuous but non- 
nutritious solution, such as *6%, NaCl in water. The washing 
seems to remove excreta of the muscle's own production, and 
the period of repose removes them perhaps by diffusion, perhaps 
by breaking them down into innocuous material. Since the 1 



4 6 



MUSCLE AND NERVE 



muscle produces lactic acids during activity, it has been sug- 
gested that acids are among the " fatigue substances " with 
which muscle poisons itself when deprived of circulating blood. 
Muscles when active seem to pour into the circulation substances 
which, of unknown chemical composition, are physiologically 
recognizable by their stimulant action on the respiratory nervous 
centre. The effect of the fatigue substances upon the contrac- 
tion of the tissue is manifest especially in the relaxation process. 
The contracted state, instead of rapidly subsiding after dis- 
continuance of the stimulus, slowly and only partially wears 
off, the muscle remaining in a condition of physiological 
" contracture." The alkaloid veratrin has a similar effect 
upon the contraction of muscle; it enormously delays the 
return from the contracted state, as also does epinephrin, an 
alkaloid extracted from the suprarenal gland. 

Nervous System. — The work of Camillo Golgi (Pavia, 1885 
and onwards) on the minute structure of the nervous system has 

led to great alteration of doctrine in neural physi- 
Theory. °l°£y* It na d Deen held that the branches of the 

nerve cells, that is to say, the fine nerve fibres — 
since all nerve fibres are nerve cell branches, and all nerve cell 
branches are nerve fibres — which form a close felt- work in the 
* nervous centres, there combined into a network actually con- 
tinuous throughout. This continuum was held to render possible 
conduction in all directions throughout the grey matter of the 
whole nervous system. The fact that conduction occurred 
preponderantly in certain directions was explained by appeal 
to a hypothetical resistance to conduction which, for reasons 
unascertained, lay less in some directions than in others. The 
intricate felt-work has by Golgi been ascertained to be a mere 
interlacement, not an actual anastomosis network; the branches 
springing from the various cells remain lifelong unattached and 
unjoined to any other than their own individual cell. Each 
neuron or nerve cell is a morphologically distinct and discrete 
unit connected functionally but not structurally with its neigh- 
bours, and leading its own life independently of the destiny of 
its neighbours. Among the properties of the neuron is con- 
ductivity in all directions. But when neurons are linked together 
it is found that nerve impulses will only pass from neuron A to 
neuron B, and not from neuron B to neuron A; that is, the 
transmission of the excited state or nervous impulse, although 
possible in each neuron both up and down its own cell branches, 
is possible from one nerve cell to another in one direction only. 
That direction is the direction in which the nerve impulses 
flow under the conditions of natural life. The synapse, therefore, 
as the place of meeting of one neuron with the next is called, 
is said to valve the nerve circuits. This determinate sense 
of the spread is called the law of forward direction. The synapse 
appears to be a weak spot in the chain of conduction, or rather 
to be a place which breaks down with comparative ease under 
stress, e.g. under effect of poisons. The axons of the motor 
neurons are, inasmuch as they are nerve fibres in nerve trunks, 
easily accessible to artificial stimuli. It can be demonstrated 
that they are practically indefatigable — repeatedly stimulated 
by electrical currents, even through many hours, they, unlike 

muscle, continue to respond with unimpaired reaction. 
Fatigue** ^ et wnen the muscular contraction is taken as index 

of the response of the nerve, it is found that unmis- 
takable signs of fatigue appear even very soon after commence- 
ment of the excitation of the nerve, and the muscle ceases 
to give any contraction in response to stimuli applied indirectly to 
it through its nerve. But the muscle will, when excited directly, 
e.g. by direct application of electric currents, contract vigorously 
after all response on its part to the stimuli (nerve impulses) 
applied to it indirectly through its nerve has failed. The 
inference is that the "fatigue substances" generated iiu.tbe 
muscle fibres in the course of their prolonged contraction injure 
and paralyse the motor end plates, which are places of synapsis 
between nerve cell and muscle cell, even earlier than they harm 
the contractility of the muscle fibres themselves. The alkaloid 
- curarin causes motor paralysis by attacking in a selective way 
this junction of motor nerve cell and striped muscular fibre. 



Non-myelinate nerve fibres are as resistant to fatigue as are 

the myelinate. 

The neuron is described as having a cell body or perikaryon 

from which the cell branches — dendrites and axon — extend* 

and it is this perikaryon which, as its name implies, 

contains the nucleus. It forms the trophic centre of f f °!!f a !lT 
_ ,. . . . . . c . of Neuron. 

the cell, just as the nucleus-containing part of every 

cell is the trophic centre of the whole cell. Any part of the cell 
cut off from the nucleus-containing part dies down: this is as 
true of nerve cells as of amoeba, and in regard to the neuron 
it constitutes what is known as the Wallerian degeneration. 
On the other hand, in some neurons, after severance of the axon 
from the rest of the cell (spinal motor cell), the whole nerve 
cell as well as the severed axon degenerates, and may eventu- 
ally die and be removed. In the severed axon the degenera- 
tion is first evident in a breaking down of the naked nerve 
filaments of the motor end plate. A little later the breaking 
down of the whole axon, both axis cylinder and myelin sheath 
alike, seems to occur simultaneously throughout its entire 
length distal to the place of severance. The complex fat of 
the myelin becomes altered chemically, while the other com- 
ponents of the sheath break down. This death of the sheath as 
well as of the axis cylinder shows that it, like the axis cylinder* 
is a part of the nerve cell itself. 

In addition to the trophic influence exerted by each part 
of the neuron on its other parts, notably by the perikaryon 
on the cell branches, one neuron also, in many instances in* 
fluences the nutrition of other neurons. When, for instance, 
the axons of the ganglion cells of the retina are severed by 
section of the optic nerve, and thus their influence upon the 
nerve cells of the visual cerebral centres is set aside, the nerve 
cells of those centres undergo secondary atrophy (Gadden's 
atrophy). They dwindle in size; they do not, however, die. 
Similarly, when the axons of the motor spinal cells are by 
severance of the nerve trunk of a muscle broken through, the 
muscle cells undergo " degeneration " — dwindle, become fatty, 
and alter almost beyond recognition. This trophic influence 
which one neuron exerts upon others, or upon the cells of an 
extrinsic tissue, such as muscle, is exerted in that 
direction which is the one normally taken by the V*?^ 
natural nerve impulses. It seems, especially in ^ euroa3t 
the case of the nexus between certain neurons, 
that the influence, loss of which endangers nutrition, is associ- 
ated with the occurrence of something more than merely the 
nervous impulses awakened from time to time in the leading 
nerve cell. The wave of change (nervous impulse) induced 
in a neuron by advent of a stimulus is after all only a sudden 
augmentation of an activity continuous within the neuron — 
a transient accentuation of one (the disintegrative) phase of 
the metabolism inherent in and inseparable from its life. The 
nervous impulse is, so to say, the sudden evanescent glow of an 
ember continuously black-hot. A continuous lesser " change " 
or stream of changes sets through the neuron, and is distributed 
by it to other neurons in the same direction and by the same 
synapses as are its nerve impulses. This gentle continuous 
activity of the neuron is called its tonus. In tracing the tonus 
of neurons to a source, one is always led link by link against 
the current of nerve force — so to say, " up stream " — to the 
first beginnings of the chain of neurons in the sensifacient surfaces 
of the body. From these, as in the eye, ear, and other sense 
organs, tonus is constantly initiated. Hence, when cut off 
from these sources, the nutrition of the neurons of various 
central mechanisms suffers. Thus the tonus of the motor 
neurons of the spinal cord is much lessened by rupture of the 
great afferent root cells which normally play upon them. 
A prominent and practically important illustration of neural 
tonus is given by the skeletal muscles. These muscles exhibit 
a certain constant condition of slight contraction, which dis- 
appears on severance of the nerve that innervates the muscle. 
It is a muscular tonus of central source consequent on 
the continual glow of excitement in the spinal motor neuron, 
whose outgoing end plays upon the muscle cells, whose ingoing 



MUSCLE AND NERVE 



47 



end is played upon by other neurons — spinal, cerebral and 
cerebellar. 

It is with the neural element of muscle tonus that tendon pheno- 
mena are intimately associated. The earliest-studied of these, the 
" knee-jerk" may serve as example of the class. It is a brief ex- 
tension of the limb at the knee-joint, due to a simple contraction of 
the extensor muscle, elicited by a tap or other short mechanical 
stimulus applied to the muscle fibres through the tendon of the 
muscle. The jerk is obtainable only from muscle fibres possessed 
of neural tonus. If the sensory nerves of the extensor muscle be 
severed, the "jerk " is lost. The brevity of the interval between 
the tap on the knee and the beginning of the resultant contraction 
of the muscle seems such as to exclude the possibility of reflex 
development. A little experience in observations on the knee-jerjc 
imparts a notion of the average strength of the " jerk." Wide 
departures from the normal standard are met with and are sympto- 
matic of certain nervous conditions. Stretching of the muscles 
antagonistic to the extensors — namely, of the flexor muscles — 
reduces the jerk by inhibiting the extensor spinal nerve cells through 
the nervous impulses generated by the tense flexor muscles. Hence 
a favourable posture of the limb for eliciting the jerk is one ensuring 
relaxation of the hamstring muscles, as when the leg has been 
-crossed upon the other. In sleep the jerk is diminished, in deep 
sleep quite abolished. Extreme bodily fatigue diminishes it. Con- 
versely, acold bath increases it. The turning of attention towards 
the knee interferes with the jerk; hence the device of directing the 
person to perform vigorously some movement, which does not 
involve the muscles ot the lower limb, at the moment when the 
light blow is dealt upon the tendon. A slight degree of contraction 
of muscle seems the substratum of all attention- The direction of 
attention to the performance of some movement by the arm ensures 
that looseness and freedom from tension in the thigh muscles which 
is essential for the provocation of the jerk. The motor cells of 
the extensor muscles, when preoccupied by cerebral influence, 
appear refractory. T. Ziehen has noted exaltation of the jerk to 
follow extirpation of a cortical centre. 

Although the cell body or perikaryon of the neuron, with 
its contained nucleus, is essential for the maintenance of the 
Co dacti ^ e °* t ^ ie ce ^ branches, it has become recognized 
in Neurons. ^aX * ne actual process and function of "con- 
duction " in many neurons can, and does, go on 
without the cell body being directly concerned in the conduction. 
S. Exner first showed, many years ago, that the nerve impulse 
travels through the spinal ganglion at the same speed as along 
the other parts of the nerve trunk — that is, that it suffers no 
delay in transit through the perikarya of the afferent root- 
neurons. Bethe has succeeded in isolating their perikarya 
from certain of the afferent neurons of the antennule of 
Carcinus. The conduction through the amputated cell branches 
continues unimpaired for many hours. This indicates that 
the conjunction between the conducting substance of the 
dendrons and that of the axon can be effected without the 
intermediation of the cell body. But the proper nutntion 
of the conducting substance is indissolubly dependent on the 
cell branches being in continuity with the cell body and nucleus 
it contains. Evidence illustrating this nexus is found in the 
visible changes produced in the perikaryon by prolonged 
activity induced and maintained in the conducting branches 
of the cell. As a result the fatigued cells appear shrunken, 
and their reaction to staining reagents alters, thus showing 
chemical alteration. Most marked is the decrease in the 
volume of the nucleus, amounting even to 44% of the initial 
volume. In the myelinated cell branches of the neuron, that 
is, in the ordinary nerve fibres, no visible change has ever been 
demonstrated as the result of any normal activity, however 
great — a striking contrast to the observations obtained on 
the perikarya. The chemical changes that accompany activity 
in the nerve fibre must be very small, for the production of 
CO2 is barely measurable, and no production of heat is 
observable as the result of the most forced tetanic activity.

to thrust out new branches and to lengthen existing branches, 
for many years far into adult life. They similarly possess power 
to repair and to regenerate their cell branches where these are 
injured or destroyed by trauma or disease. This is the explana- 
tion of the repair of nerve trunks that have been severed, with 
consequent degeneration of the peripheral nerve fibres. As a 
rule, a longer time is required to restore the motor than the 
sensory functions of a nerve trunk. 

Whether examined by functional or by structural features, 
the conducting paths of the nervous system, traced from 
beginning to end, never terminate in the centres of 
that system, but pass through them. All ultimately 
emerge as efferent channels. Every efferent 
channel, after entrance in the central nervous system, sub- 
divides; of its subdivisions some pass to efferent channels 
soon, others pass further and further within the cord and brain 
before they finally reach channels of outlet. All the longest 
routes thus formed traverse late in their course the cortex of 
the cerebral hemisphere. It is this relatively huge development 
of cortex cerebri which is the pre-eminent structural character 
of man. This means that the number of " longest routes " 
in man is, as compared with lower animals, disproportionately 
great. In the lower animal forms there is no such nervous 
structure at all as the cortex cerebri. In the frog, lizard, and 
even bird, it is thin and poorly developed. In the marsupials 
it is more evident, and its excitation by electric currents evokes 
movements in the musculature of the crossed side of the body. 
Larger and thicker in the rabbit, when excited it gives rise in 
that animal to movements of the eyes and of the fore-limbs 
and neck; but it is only in much higher types, such as the 
dog, that the cortex yields, under experimental excitation, 
definitely localized foci, whence can be evoked movements 
of the fore-limb, hind-limb, neck, eyes, ears and face. In 
the monkey the proportions it assumes are still greater, and 
the number of foci, for distinct movements of this and that 
member, indeed for the individual joints of each limb, are 
much more numerous, and together occupy a more extensive 
surface, though . relatively to the total surface of the brain a 
smaller one. 

Experiment shows that in the manlike (anthropoid) apes the 
differentiation of the foci or "centres " of movement in the motor 
field of the cortex is even more minute. In them areas arc found 
whence stimuli excite movements of this or that finger alone, 
of the upper lip without the lower, of the tip only of the tongue, 
or of one upper eyelid by itself. The movement evoked from 
a point of cortex is not always the same; its character is 
determined by movements evoked from neighbouring points 
of cortex immediately antecedently. Thus a point A will, when 
excited soon subsequent to point B, which latter yields pro- 
trusion of lips, itself yield lip-protrusion, whereas if excited 
after C, which yields lip-retraction, it will itself yield lip-retrac- 
tion. The movements obtained by point-to-point excitation 
of the cortex are often evidently imperfect as compared with 
natural movements — that is, are only portions of complete 
normal movements. Thus among the tongue movements 
evoked by stigmatic stimulation of the cortex undeviated 
protrusion or retraction of the organ is not found. Again, 
from different points of the cortex the assumption of the 
requisite positions of the tongue, lips, cheeks, palate and 
epiglottis, as components in the act of sucking, can be pro- 
voked singly. Rarely can the whole action be provoked, and 
then only gradually, by prolonged and strong excitation 
of one of the requisite points, e.g. that for the tongue, with 
which the other points are functionally connected. Again, 
no single point in the cortex evokes the act of ocular converg- 
ence and fixation. All this means that the execution of natural 
movements employs simultaneous co-operative activity of a 
number of points in the motor fields on both sides of the brain 
together. 

The accompanying simple figure indicates better than any 
verbal description the topography of the main groups of foci 
in the motor field of a manlike ape (chimpanzee). It will be

noted from it that there is no direct relation between the extent of 
a cortical area and the mass of muscles which it controls. 
The mass of muscles in the trunk is greater than in the leg, and 
'in the leg is greater than in the arm, and in the arm is many times 
greater than in the face and head; yet for the last the cortical 
area is the most extensive of all, and for the first-named is 
the least extensive of all. 

The motor field of the cortex is, taken altogether, relatively 
to the size of the lower parts of the brain, larger in the anthropoid 
than in the inferior monkey brains. But in the anthropoid

come to be furnished more and more with fibres that are fully 
myelinate. At the beginning of its history each is unprovided 
with myelinate nerve fibres. The excitable foci of the cerebral 
cortex are well myelinated long before the unexcitable are so. 
The regions of the cortex, whose conduction paths are early 
completed, may be arranged in groups by their connexions 
with sense-organs: eye-region, ear-region, skin and somaesthetic 
region, olfactory and taste region. The areas of intervening 
cortex, arriving at structural completion later than the above 
sense-spheres } are called by some association-spheres, to indicate 
the view that they contain the neural mechanisms of 
reactions (some have said " ideas ") associated with 
the sense perceptions elaborated in the several sense- 
spheres. 

The name " motor area " is given to that region 
of cortex whence, as D. Ferrier's investigations 
showed, motor reactions of the facial and season- 
limb muscles are regularly and easily motor 
evoked. This region is often called the CeniFss. 
sensorimotor cortex, and the term somaesthetic has 
also been used and seems appropriate. It has been 
found that disturbance of sensation, as well as 
disturbance of movement, is often incurred by its 
injury. Patients in whom, for purposes of diagnosis, 
it has been electrically excited, describe, as the 
initial effect of the stimulation, tingling and obscure 
but locally-limited sensations, referred to the part 
whose muscles a moment later are thrown into 
co-ordinate activity. The distinction, therefore, 
between the movement of the eyeballs, elicited from 
the occipital (visual) cortex, and that of the hand, 
elicited from the cortex in the region of the central

of Chimpanzee. difference between the kind of sense and sense-organ 

brain still more increased even than the motor field are the great in the two cases, the muscular apparatus in each case being 



regions of the cortex outside that field, which yield no definite 
movements under electric excitation, and are for that reason 
known as " silent." The motor field, therefore, though absolutely 
larger, forms a smaller fraction of the whole cortex of the brain 
than in the lower forms. The statement that in the anthropoid 
(orang-outan) brain the groups of foci in the motor fields of the 
cortex are themselves separated one from another by sur- 
rounding inexcitable cortex, has been made and was one of 
great interest, but has not been confirmed by subsequent 
observation. That in man the excitable foci of the motor 
field are islanded in excitable surface similarly and even more 
extensively, was a natural inference, but it had its chief basis 
in the observations on the orang, now known to be erroneous. 

In the diagram there is indicated the situation of the cortical 
centres for movement of the vocal cords. Their situation is 
at the lower end of the motor field. That they should lie 
there is interesting, because that place is close to one known 
in man to be associated with management of the movements 
concerned in speech. When that area in man is injured, the 
ability to utter words is impaired. Not that there is paralysis 
of the muscles of speech, since these muscles can be used perfectly 
for all acts other than speech. The area in man is known as 
the motor centre for speech; in most persons it exists only in 
the left half of the brain and not in the right. In a similar way 
damage of a certain small portion of the temporal lobe of the 
brain produces loss of intelligent apprehension of words spoken, 
although there is no deafness and although words seen are 
perfectly apprehended. Another region, " the angular region," 
is similarly related to intelligent apprehension of words seen, 
though not of words heard. 

When this differentiation of cortex, with its highest expres- 
sion in man, is collated* with the development of the cortex 
as studied in the successive phases of its growth and ripening 
in the human infant, a suggestive analogy is obvious. The 
nervous paths in the brain and cord, as they attain completion, 



an appanage of the sensual. 

That the lower types of vertebrate, such as fish, e.g. carp, 
possess practically no cortex cerebri, and nevertheless execute 
" volitional " acts involving high co-ordination and suggesting 
the possession by them of associative memory, shows that for 
the existence of these phenomena the cortex cerebri is in them 
not essential. In the dog it has been proved that after removal 
from the animal of every vestige of its cortex cerebri, it still 
executes habitual acts of great motor complexity requiring 
extraordinarily delicate adjustment of muscular contraction. 
It can walk, run and feed; such an animal, on wounding its 
foot, will run on three legs, as will a normal dog under similar 
mischance. But signs of associative memory are almost, if 
not entirely, wanting. Throughout three years such a dog 
failed to learn that the attendant's lifting it from the cage at a 
certain hour was the preliminary circumstance of the feeding- 
hour; yet it did exhibit hunger, and would refuse further food 
when a sufficiency had been taken. In man, actually gross 
sensory defects follow even limited lesions of the cortex. Thus 
the rabhit and the dog are not absolutely blinded by removal 
of the entire cortex, but in man destruction of the occipital 
cortex produces total blindness, even to the extent that the 
pupil of the eye does not respond when light is flashed into 
the eye. 

Examination of the cerebellum by the method of Wallerian 
degeneration has shown that a large number of spinal and 
bulbar nerve cells send branches up into it. These Cere f ieUam ^ 
seem to end, for the most, part, in the grey cortex 
of the median lobe, some, though not the majority, of 
them decussating across the median line. The organ seems 
also to receive many fibres from the parietal region of the 
cerebral hemisphere. From the organ there emerge fibres 
which cross to the opposite red nucleus, and directly or 
indirectly reach the thalamic region of the crossed hemi- 
sphere. The pons or middle peduncle, which was regarded, 



MUSCLE AND NERVE

on the uncertain ground of naked-eye dissection of human 
anatomy, as commissural between the two lateral lobes of 
the cerebellum, is now known to constitute chiefly a cerebro- 
cerebellar decussating path. Certain cerebellar cells send 
processes down to the cell-group in the bulb known as the 
nucleus of Deiters, which latter projects fibres down the 
spinal cord. Whether there is any other or direct emergent 
path from the cerebellum into the spinal cord is a matter 
on which opinion is divided. 

Injuries of the cerebellum, if large, derange the power of 
executing movements, without producing any detectable 
derangement of sensation. The derangement gradually dis- 
appears, unless the damage to the organ be very wide. A 
reeling gait, oscillations of the body which impart a zigzag 
direction to the walk, difficulty in standing, owing to unsteadi- 
ness of limb, are common in cerebellar disease. On the other 
hand, congenital defect amounting to absence of one cerebellar 
hemisphere has been found to occasion practically no symptoms 
whatsoever. Not a hundredth part of the cerebellum has 
remained, and yet there has existed ability to stand, to walk, to 
handle and lift objects in a fairly normal way, without any trace 
of impairment of cutaneous or muscular sensitivity. The 
damage to the cerebellum must, it would seem, occur abruptly or 
quickly in order to occasion marked derangement of function, 
and then the derangement falls on the execution of movements. 
One aspect of this derangement, named by Luciani astasia, 
is a tremor heightened by or only appearing when the muscles 
enter upon action — " intention tremor." Vertigo is a frequent 
result of cerebellar injury: animals indicate it by their actions; 
patients describe it. To interpret this vertigo, appeal must 
be made to disturbances, other than cerebellar, which like- 
wise occasion vertigo. These include, besides ocular squint, 
many spatial positions and movements unwonted to the body: 
the looking from a height, the gliding over ice, sea-travel, to 
some persons even travelling by train, or the covering of one 
eye. Common to all these conditions is the synchronous rise 
of perceptions of spatial relations between the self and the 
environment which have not, or have rarely, before arisen in 
synchronous combination. The tactual organs of the soles, and 
the muscular sense organs of limbs and trunk, are originating 
perceptions that indicate that the self is standing on the 
solid earth, yet the eyes are at the same time originating 
perceptions that indicate that the solid earth is far away 
below the standing self. The combination is hard to harmonize 
at first; it is at least not given as innately harmonized. Per- 
ceptions regarding the " me " are notoriously highly charged 
with " feeling," and the conflict occasions the feeling insuffi- 
ciently described as " giddiness." The cerebellum receives 
paths from most, if not from all, of the afferent roots. With 
certain of these it stands associated most closely, namely, 
with the vestibular, representing the sense organs which furnish 
data ♦for appreciation of positions and movements of the head, 
and with the channels, conveying centripetal impressions from 
the apparatus of skeletal movement. Disorder of the cere- 
bellum sets at variance, brings discord into, the space-percep- 
tions contributory to the movement. The body's movement 
becomes thus imperfectly adjusted to the spatial requirements 
of the act it would perform. 

In the physiological basis of sense exist many impressions 
which, apart from and devoid of psychical accompaniment, 
reflexly influence motor (muscular) innervation. It is with 
this sort of habitually apsychical reaction that the cerebellum 
is, it would seem, employed. That it is apparently devoid of 
psychical concomitant need not imply that the impressions 
concerned in it are crude and inelaborate. The seeming want 
of reaction of so much of the cerebellar structure under artificial 
stimulation, and the complex relay system revealed in the 
histology of the cerebellum, suggest that the impressions are 
elaborate. Its reaction preponderantly helps to secure co- 
ordinate innervation of the skeletal musculature, both for 
maintenance of attitude and for execution of movements. 

Sleep. — The more obvious of the characters of sleep {q.v.) are 



essentially nervous. In deep sleep the threshold-value of the 
stimuli for the various senses is very greatly raised, rising 
rapidly during the first hour and a half of sleep, and then declining 
with gradually decreasing decrements. The muscles become less 
tense than in their waking state: their tonus is diminished, the 
upper eyelid falls, and the knee-jerk is in abeyance. The 
respiratory rhythm is less frequent and the breathing less deep; 
the heart-beat is less frequent; the secretions are less copious; 
the pupil is narrow; in the brain there exists arterial anaemia with 
venous congestion, so that the blood-flow there is less than in the 
waking state. 

It has been suggested that the gradual cumulative result 
of the activity of the nerve cells during the waking day is to 
load the brain tissue with " fatigue-substances " 
which clog the action of the cells, and thus periodi- sleep. 
cally produce that loss of consciousness, &c, which 
is sleep. Such a drugging of tissue by its own excreta is known 
in muscular fatigue, but the fact that the depth of sleep progres- 
sively increases for an hour and more after its onset prevents 
complete explanation of sleep on similar lines. It has been 
urged that the neurons retract during sleep, and that thus at the 
synapses the gap between nerve cell and nerve cell becomes 
wider, or JJjat the supporting cells expand between the nerve 
cells and tend to isolate the latter one from the other. Certain it is 
that in the course of the waking day a great number of stimuli 
play on the sense organs, and through these produce disintegra- 
tion of the living molecules of the central nervous system. 
Hence during the day the assimilatory processes of these cells 
are overbalanced by their wear and tear, and the end-result is 
that the cell attains an atomic condition less favourable to 
further disintegration than to reintegration. That phase of 
cell life which we are accustomed to call " active " is accompanied 
always by disintegration. When in the cell the assimilative 
processes exceed dissimilative, the external manifestations of 
energy are liable to cease or diminish. Sleep is not exhaustion 
of the neuron in the sense that prolonged activity has reduced 
its excitability to zero. The nerve cell just prior to sleep is still 
well capable of response to stimuli, although perhaps the thres- 
hold-value of the stimulus has become rather high, whereas after 
entrance upon sleep and continuance of sleep for several hours, 
and more, when all spur to the dissimilation process has been 
long withheld, the threshold-value of the sensory stimulus 
becomes enormously higher than before. The exciting cause 
of sleep is therefore no complete exhaustion of the available 
material of the cells, nor is it entirely any paralysing of them by 
their excreta. It is more probably abeyance of external function 
during a periodic internal assimilatory phase. 

Two processes conjoin to initiate the assimilatory phase. There 
is close interconnexion between the two^ aspects of the double 
activity that in physiological theory constitute the chemical life of 
protoplasm, between dissimilation and assimilation. Hering has* 
long insisted on a self-regulative adjustment of the cell metabolism, 
so that action involves reaction, increased catabolism necessitates 
after-increase of anabolism. The long-continued incitement to 
catabolism of the waking day thus of itself predisposes the nerve 
cells towards rebound intothe opposite phase; the increased cata^ 
bolism due to the day's stimuli induces increase of anabolism, and 
though recuperation goes on to a large extent during the day itself, 
the recuperative process is slower than, and lags behind, the dis-. 
integrative. Hence there occurs a cumulative effect, progressively 
increasing from the opening till the closing hours. The second 
factor inducing the assimilative change is the withdrawal of the 
nervous system from sensual stimulation. The eyes are closed, 
the maintenance.of posture by active contraction is replaced by the 
recumbent pose which can be maintained by static action and the 
mere mechanical consistence of the body, the ears are screened 
from noise in the quiet chamber, the skin from localized pressure 
by a soft, yielding couch. The effect of thus reducing the excitant 
action of the environment is to give consciousness over more to 
mere revivals by # memory, and gradually consciousness lapses. A 
remarkable case is well authenticated, where, owing to disease, a 
young man had lost the use of all the senses save of one eye and of 
one ear. If these last channels were sealed, in two or three minutes' 
time he invariably fell asleep. 

, If natural sleep is the expression 'of a phase of decreased excit- 
ability due to the setting in of a tide of anabolism in the cells of the 
nervous system, what is the action of narcotics ? They lower the 



5° 



MUSCOVITE 



external activities of the cells, but do they not at the same time 
lower the internal, reparative, assimilative activity of the cell that 
in natural sleep goes vigorously forward preparing the system for 
the next day's drain on energy? In most cases they seem to 
Narcotics * ower Dotn t ^ ie internal and the external activity of the 
nerve cells, to lessen the cell's entire metabolism, to 
reduce the speed of its whole chemical movement and life. Hence 
it isnot surprising that often the refreshment, the recuperation, 
obtained from and felt after sleep induce^! by a drug amounts to 
nothing, or to worse than nothing. But very often refreshment 
is undoubtedly obtained from such narcotic sleep. It may be 
supposed that in the latter case the effect of the drug has been to 
ensure occurrence of that second predisposing factor mentioned 
above, of that withdrawal of sense impulses from the nerve centres 
that serves to usher in the state of sleep. In certain conditions it 
may be well worth while by means of narcotic drugs to close the 
portals of the senses for the sake of thus obtaining stillness in the 
chambers of the mind; their enforced quietude may induce a 
period in which natural rest and repair continue long after the 
initial unnatural arrest of vitality due to the drug itself has passed 
away. 

Hypnotism. — The physiology of this group of " states " is, 
as regards the real understanding of their production, eminently 
vague (see also Hypnotism). The conditions which tend to in- 
duce them contain generally, as one element, constrained visual 
attention prolonged beyond ordinary duration. Symptoms 
attendant on the hypnotic state are closure of ths< eyelids by 
the hypnotizer without subsequent attempt to open them by 
the hypnotized subject; the pupils, instead of being constricted, 
as for near vision, dilate, and there sets in a condition superficially 
resembling sleep. But in natural sleep the action of all parts 
of the nervous system is subdued, whereas in the hypnotic the 
reactions of the lower, and some even of the higher, parts are 
exalted. Moreover, the reactions seem to follow the sense 
impressions with such fatality, that, as an inference, absence of 
will-power to control them or suppress them is suggested. This 
reflex activity with " paralysis of will " is characteristic of the 
somnambulistic state. The threshold-value of the stimuli 
adequate for the various senses may be extraordinarily lowered. 
Print of microscopic size may be read; a watch ticking in another 
room can be heard. Judgment of weight and texture of surface 
is exalted; thus a card can in a dark room be felt and then 
re-selected from the re-shuffled pack. Akin to this condition is 
that in which the power of maintaining muscular effort is in- 
creased; the individual may lie stiff with merely head and feet 
supported on two chairs; the limbs can be held outstretched for 
hours at a time. This is the cataleptic state, the phase of hypno- 
tism which the phenomena of so-called " animal hypnotism " 
resemble most. A frog or fowl or guinea-pig held in some 
unnatural pose, and retained so forcibly for a time, becomes 
■" set " in that pose, or rather in a posture of partial recovery of 
the normal posture. In this state it remains motionless for 
various periods. This condition is more than usually readily 
induced when the cerebral hemispheres have been removed. 
The decerebrate monkey exhibits " cataleptoid " reflexes. 
Father A. Kircher's experimentum mirabile with the fowl and 
?the chalk line succeeds best with the decerebrate hen. The 
: attitude may be described as due to prolonged, not very intense, 
.discharge from reflex centres that regulate posture and are 
^probably intimately connected with the cerebellum. A sudden 
jintense sense stimulus usually suffices to end this tonic discharge. 
It completes the movement that has already set in but had been 
-checked, as it were, half-way, though tonically maintained. 
Coincidently with the persistence of the tonic contraction, the 
higher and volitional centres seem to lie under a spell of 
inhibition; their action, which would complete or cut short the 
posture-spasm, rests in abeyance. Suspension of cerebral 
influence exists even more markedly, of course, when the 
^cerebral hemispheres have been ablated. 

But a potent — according to some, the most potent — factor 
;in hypnotism, namely, suggestion, is unrepresented in the 
production of so-called animal hypnotism. We know that one 
idea suggests another, and that volitional movements are the 
outcome of ideation. If we assume that there is a material 
process at the basis of ideation, we may take the analogy of the 
-concomitance between a spinal reflex movement and a skin 



sensation. The physical " touch " that initiates the psychical 
" touch " initiates, through the very same nerve channels, a 
reflex movement responsive to the physical "-touch," just as the 
psychical " touch " may be considered also a response to the 
same physical event. But in the decapitated animal we have 
good arguments for belief that wc get the reflex movement alone 
as response; the psychical touch drops out. Could we assume 
that there is in the adult man reflex machinery which is of higher 
order than the merely spinal, which employs much more complex 
motor mechanisms than* they, and is connected with a much 
wider range of sense organs; and could we assume that- this 
reflex machinery, although usually associated in its action with 
memorial and volitional processes, may in certain circumstances 
be sundered from these latter and unattendant on them — may 
in fact continue in work when the higher processes are at a 
standstill — then we might imagine a condition resembling that 
of the somnambulistic and cataleptic states of hypnotism. 

Such assumptions are not wholly unjustified. Actions of great 
complexity and delicacy of adjustment are daily executed by each 
of us without what is drdinarily understood as volition, and without 
more than a mere shred of memory attached thereto. To take 
one's watch from the pocket and look at it when from a familiar 
clock-tower a familiar bell strikes a familiar hour, is an instance of 
a habitual action initiated by a sense perception outside attentive 
consciousness. We may suddenly remember dimly afterwards that 
we have done so, and we quite fail to recall the difference between 
the watch time and the clock time. In many instances hypnotism 
seems to establish quickly reactions similar to such as usually 
result only from long and closely attentive practice. The sleeping 
mother rests undisturbed by the various noises of the house and 
street, but wakes at a slight murmur from her child. The ship's 
engineer, engaged in conversation with some visitor to the engine- 
room, talks apparently undisturbed by all the multifold noise and 
rattle of the machinery, but let the noise alter in some item which, 
though un noticeable to the visitor, betokens importance to the 
trained ear, and his passive attention is in a moment caught. The 
warders at an asylum have been hypnotized to sleep by the bedside 
of dangerous patients, and " suggested " to awake the instant the 
patients attempt to get out of bed, sounds which had no import for 
them being inhibited by suggestion. Warders in this way worked 
all day and performed night duty also for months without showing 
fatigue. This is akin to the " repetition " which, read by the 
schoolboy last thing overnight, is on waking " known by heart." 
Most of us can wake somewhere about a desired although unusually 
early hour, if overnight we desire much to do so. 

Two theories of a physiological nature have been proposed 
to account for the separation of the complex reactions of 
these conditions of hypnotism from volition and from memory. 
R. P. H. Heidenhain's view is that the cortical centres of the 
hemisphere are inhibited by peculiar conditions attaching 
to the initiatory sense stimuli. W. T. Preyer's view is that the 
essential condition for initiation is fatigue of the will-power 
under a prolonged effort of undivided attention. 

Hypnotic somnambulism and hypnotic catalepsy are not the 
only or the most profound changes of nervous condition that 
hypnosis can induce. The physiological derangement which 
is the basis of the abeyance of volition may, if hypnotism be 
profound, pass into more widespread derangement, exhibiting 
itself as the hypnotic lethargy. This is associated not only with 
paralysis of will but with profound anaesthesia. Proposals 
have been made to employ hypnotism as a method of producing 
anaesthesia for surgical purposes, but there are two grave 
objections to such employment. In order to produce a sufficient 
degree of hypnotic lethargy the subject must be made extremely 
susceptible, and this can only be done by repeated hypnotization. 
It is necessary to hypnotize patients every day for several weeks 
before they can be got into a degree of stupor sufficient to allow 
of the safe execution of a surgical operation. But the state 
itself, when reached, is at least as dangerous to life as is that 
produced by inhalation of ether, and it is more difficult to 
recover from. Moreover, by the processes the subject has gone 
through he has had those physiological activities upon which 
his volitional power depends excessively deranged, and not 
improbably permanently enfeebled. (C. S. S.) 

MUSCOVITE, a rock-forming mineral belonging to the mica 
group (see Mica). It is also known as potash-mica, being a 
potassium, hydrogen and'aluminium orthosilicate, H 2 KAlj(Si04)3. 



MUSCULAR SYSTEM

As the common white mica obtainable in thin, transparent 
cleavage sheets of large size it was formerly used in Russia for 
window panes and known as " Muscovy glass "; hence the name 
muscovite, proposed by J. D. Daila in 1850. It crystallizes in 
the monoclinic system; distinctly developed crystals, however, 
are rare and have the form of rough six-sided prisms or plates: 
thin scales without definite crystal outlines are more common. 
The most prominent feature is the perfect cleavage parallel to 
the basal plane (c in the figure), on 
which the lustre is pearly in character. 
The hardness is 2-2^, and the spec, 
grav. 2-8-2-9. The plane of the optic 
axes is perpendicular to the plane of 
symmetry and the acute bisectrix nearly normal to the cleavage; 
the optic axial angle is 60-70 , and double refraction is strong 
and negative in sign. 

Muscovite frequently occurs as fine scaly to almost compact 
aggregates, especially when, as is often the case, it has resulted 
by the alteration of some other mineral, such as felspar, topaz, 
cyanite, &c; several varieties depending on differences in 
structure have been distinguished. Fine scaly varieties are 
damourite, margarodite (from Gr. /xap7aptr7?s, a pearl), gilber- 
tite, seriate (from Gijpacbs, silky), &c. In sericite the fine scales 
are united in fibrous aggregates giving rise to a silky lustre: 
this variety is a common constituent of phyllites and sericite- 
schists. Oncosine (from cy/coais, intumescence) is a compact 
variety forming rounded aggregates, which swell up when 
heated before the blowpipe. Closely related to oncosine are several 
compact minerals, included together under the name pinite, 
which have resulted by the alteration of iolite, spodumene and 
other minerals. Other varieties depend on differences in 
chemical composition. Fuchsite or " chrome-mica " is a bright 
green muscovite containing chromium; it has been used as a 
decorative stone. Oellacherite is a variety containing some 
barium. In phengite there is more silica than usual, the com- 
position approximating to H2KAIs(SisOs)s- 

Muscovite is of wide distribution and is the commonest of the 
micas. In igneous rocks it is found only in granite, never in 
volcanic rocks; but it is abundant in gneiss and mica-schist, 
and in phyllites and clay-slates, where it has been formed at 
the expense of alkali-felspar by dynamo-metamorphic processes. 
In pegmatite-veins traversing granite, gneiss or mica-schist it 
occurs as large sheets of commercial value, and is mined in India, 
the United States and Brazil (see Mica), and to a limited extent, 
together with felspar, in southern Norway and hi the Urals. 
Large sheets of muscovite were formerly obtained from Solovetsk 
Island, Archangel. (L. J. S.) 

MUSCULAR SYSTEM {Anatomy 1 ). The muscular tissue 
(Lat. musculus, from a fancied resemblance of certain muscles 
to a little mouse) is of three kinds: (1) voluntary or striped 
muscle; (2) involuntary or unstriped muscle, found in the skin, 
walls of hollow viscera, coats of blood and lymphatic vessels, &c. ; 
(3) heart muscle. The microscopical differences of these different 
kinds are discussed in the article on Connective Tissues. Here 
only the voluntary muscles, which are under the control of the 
will, are to be considered. 

The voluntary muscles form the red flesh of an animal, and 
are the structures by which one part of the body is moved at 
will upon another. Each muscle is said to have an origin and 
an insertion, the former being that attachment which is usually 
more fixed, the latter that which is more movable. This 
distinction, however, although convenient, is an arbitrary one, 
and an example may make this clear. If we take the pectoralis 
major, which is attached to the front of the chest on the one 
hand and to the upper part of the arm bone on the other, the 
effect of its contraction will obviously be to draw the arm towards 
the chest, so that its origin under ordinary circumstances is said 
to be from the chest while its insertion is into the arm; but if, 
in climbing a tree, the hand grasps a branch above, the muscular 
contraction will draw the chest towards the arm, and the latter 
will then become the origin. Generally, but not always, a

muscle is partly fleshy and partly tendinous; the fleshy contractile 
part is attached at one or both ends to cords or sheets of white 
fibrous tissue, which in some cases pass round pullies and so 
change the direction of the muscle's 
action. The other end of these cords 
or tendons is usually attached to the 
periosteum of bones, with which it 
blends. In some cases, when a 
tendon passes round a bony pulley, 
a sesamoid bone is developed in it 
which diminishes the effects of fric- 
tion. A good example of this is the 
patella in the tendon of the rectus 
femoris (fig. 1, P.). 

Every muscle is supplied with blood 
vessels and lymphatics (fig. 1, v 9 a, /), 
and also with one or more nerves. 
The nerve supply is very important 
both from a medical and a morpho- 
logical point of view. The approxi- 
mate attachments are also important, 
because unless they are realized 
the action of the muscle cannot be 
understood, but the exact attach- " 
ments are perhaps laid too great stress 
on in the anatomical teaching of 
medical students. The study of the 
actions of muscles is, of course, a 
physiological one, but teaching the 
subject has been handed over to the 
anatomists, and the results have been 
in some respects unfortunate. Until 
very recently the anatomist studied 
only the dead body, and his one idea 
of demonstrating the action of a 
muscle was to expose and then to 
pull it, and whatever happened he 
said was the action of that muscle. 
It is now generally recognized that 
no movement is so simple that only 
one muscle is concerned in it, and that 
what a, muscle may do and what it 
really does do are not necessarily the 
same thing. As far as the deeper 
muscles are concerned, we still have 
onlythe anatomical method to depend 
upon, but with the superficial muscles it should be checked by- 
causing a living person to perform certain movements and then 
studying which muscles take part in them. 

For a modern study of muscular actions, see C. E. Beevor's; 
Croonian Lectures for 1903 (London, 1904). 

Muscles have various shapes: they may be fusiform, as in fig. 1,, 
conical, riband-like, or flattened into triangular or quadrilateral: 
sheets. They may also be attached to skin, cartilage or fascia. 
instead of to bone, while certain muscles surround openings, 
which they constrict and are called sphincters. The names of the- 
muscles have gradually grown up, and no settled plan has been t 
used in giving them. Sometimes, as in the coraco-brachialis and| 
thyro-hyoid, the name describes the origin and insertion of the- 
muscle, and, no doubt, for the student of human anatomy this; 
is the most satisfactory plan, since by learning the name the 
approximate attachments are also learnt. Sometimes the name 
only indicates some peculiarity in the shape of the muscle afwj 
gives no clue to its position in the body or its attachments; 
examples of this are biceps, semitendinosus and pyriformis. 
Sometimes, as in the flexor carpi ulnaris and corrugator supercilii K 
the use of the muscle is shown. At other times the position in t 
the body is indicated, but not the attachments, as in the tibialis; 
anticus and peroneus longus, while, at other times, as in the case. 
of the peclineus, the name is only misleading. Fortunately the- 
names of the describers themselves are very seldom applied to.

The buccinator muscle In the substance of the cheeks rises from the 
upper and lower jaws and runs forward to blend with the orbicularis 
oris. All the foregoing are known as muscles of expression and all 
arc supplied by the seventh or facial nerve. The temporal muscle 
at the side of the cranium (fig. 3) and the masseter (fig. 2), which 
rises from the zygoma, close the mouth, since both are inserted into 
the ramus of the mandible; while, rising from the pterygoid plates, 
are the external and internal pterygoid muscles (fig. 3), the former of 
which pulls forward the condyle, and so the whole mandible, while 
the latter helps to close the mouth by acting on the angle of the lower 
jaw. This group of muscles forms the masticatory set, all of which 
are supplied by the third division of the fifth nerve. For the 
muscles of the orbit, sec Eye ; for those of the soft palate and pharynx, 
see Pharynx; and for those of the tongue, see Tongue. 



both triangles to the hyoid bone Where it passes deep to the 
sterno-mastoid it has a central tendon which is bound to the first 
rib by a loop of cervical fascia. Rising from the styloid process are 
three muscles, the stylo-glossus, stylo-hyoid and stylo- pharyngeus, 
the names of which indicate their attachments. Covering these 
muscles of the anterior triangle is a thin sheet, close to the skin, 
called the platysma, the upper fibres of which run back from the 
mouth over the cheek and arc named the risorius (fig. 2) ; this sheet 
is one of the few remnants in man of the skyi musculature or panni- 
cuius carnosus of lower Mammals. With regard to the nerve supply 
of the anterior triangle muscles, all those which go to the tongue 
are supplied by the hypoglossal or twelfth cranial nerve while the 
muscles below the hyoid bone arc apparently supplied from this 
nerve but really from the upper cervical nerves (see Nerve,

Muscles 9F the Neck (fig. 4).— Just below the mandible is the 
digastric, which, as its name shows, has two bellies and a central 
tendon; the anterior belly, supplied by the fifth nerve, is attached to 
the mandible near the symphysis, the posterior supplied by the 
seventh of the mastoid process, while the central tendon is bound 
to the hyoid bone. Stretching across from one side of the lower jaw 
to the other and forming a floor to the mouth is the mylo-hyoid muscle ; 
posteriorly this reaches the hyoid bone, and in the mid-line has a 
tendinous raphe separating the two halves of the muscle. Rising 
from the manubrium sterni and inner part of the clavicle is the 
stern o-cleido-mastoid, which is inserted into the mastoid process and 
superior curved lines of the occipital bone; when it contracts it 
makes the face look over the opposite shoulder, and it is supplied 
by the spinal accessory nerve as well as by branches from the 
cervical plexus. It is an important surgical landmark, and forms a 
diagonal across the quadrilateral outline of the side of the neck, 
dividing it into an anterior triangle with its apex downward and a 
posterior with its apex upward. In the anterior triangle the relative 

Cositions of the hyoid bone, thyroid cartilage and sternum should 
e realized, and then the hyo-possus, tkyro-hyoid, sterno-hyoid and 
sterno-thyroid muscles are explained by their names. The omo-hyoid 
muscle rises from "the upper border of the scapula and runs across 



Cranial; and Nerve, Spikal). The posterior triangle is formed 
by the sterno-mastoid in front, the trapezius behind, and the clavicle 
below ; in its floor from above downward part of the following muscles 
are seen: complexus, splenitis, levator anguli scapulae, scalenus 
medius and scalenus anticus. Sometimes a small piece of the 
scalenus posticus is caught sight of behind the scalenus medius. The 
splcnius rotates the head to its own side, the levator anguli scapulae 
raises the upper angle of the scapula, while the three scalencs run 
from the transverse processes of the cervical vertebrae and fix or 
raise the upper ribs. The trapezius (fig. 5) arises from the spine9 
of the thoracic vertebrae and the ligamentum nuchac, and is inserted 
into the outer third of the clavicle and the spine of the scapula; it is 
used in shrugging the shoulders and in drawing the upper part of the 
scapula toward the mid-dorsal line. Its nerve supply is the spinal 
accessory and third and fourth cervical nerves. When the super- 
ficial muscles and complexus are removed from the back of the neck, 
the sub-occipital triangle is seen beneath the occipital bone. Exter- 
nally it is bounded by the superior oblique, running from the trans- 
verse process of the atlas to the lateral part of the occipital bone, 
internally by the rectus capitis posticus major, passing from the spine 
of the axis to the lateral part of the occipital bone, and inferiorly by 
the inferior oblique joining the spine oi the axis to the transverse

process of the atlas. These muscles move the head on the atlas 
and the atlas on the axis. They are supplied by the posterior branch 
of the first cervical nerve. 

Muscles of the Trunk.— The trapezius has already been de- 
scribed as a superficial muscle of the upper part of the back; in the 
loin region the latissimus dorsi (fig. 5) is the superficial muscle, its 
origin being from the lower thoracic spines, lower ribs and lumbar

forming the semispinalis and multifidus spinae muscles. The* 
latissimus dorsi and rhomboids, are supplied by branches of the 
brachial plexusof nerves, while the deeper muscles get their nerves 
from the posterior primary divisions of the spinal nerves (see Nerve, 
Spinal). On the anterior part of the thoracic region the pectoralur 
major runs from the clavicle, sternum and ribs, to the humerus (fig. 6) ; 
deep to this is the pectoralis minor, passing from the upper ribs to-

fascia, and it is inserted into the upper part of the arm bone or 
humerus. When the trapezius is cut, the rhomboid muscles (major 
and minor) passing from the upper thoracic spines to the vertebral 
border of the scapula are seen, and deep to these is the serratus 
posticus superior^ passing from nearly the same spines to the upper 
ribs. -On reflecting the latissimus dorsi the serratus posticus inferior 
is seen running from the lower thoracic spines to the lower ribs. 
When these muscles are removed the great mass of the erector spinae 
-is exposed, familiar to every one as the upper cut of the sirloin or ribs 
of beef; it runs all the way up the (dorsal side of the vertebral column 
from the pelvis to the occiput, the ^complcxus already mentioned 
being its extension to the head. It is longitudinally segmented 
into many different bundles to which special names are given, and it 
is attached to the Various vertebrae and ribs as it goes up, thus 
straightening the spinal column. Deep to the erector spinae are 
found shorter bundles passing from one vertebra to another and 



the coracoid process. The serratus magnus is a large muscle rising 
by serrations from the upper eight ribs, and running back to the 
vertebral border of the scapula, which it draws forward as in the 
fencer's lunge. Between the ribs are the external and internal inter- 
costal muscles; the former beginning at the tubercle and ending at 
the junctions of the ribs with their cartilages, while the latter only 
begin at the angle of the ribs but are prolonged on to the sternum, so 
that an interchondral as well as an intercostal part of each muscle 
is recognized. The fibres of the external intercostals run downward 
and forward, those of the internal downward and backward (see 
Respiration). The abdominal walls are formed of three sheets 
of muscle, of which the most superficial or external oblique (fig. 6) 
is attached to the outer surfaces of the lower ribs; its fibres run 
downward and forward to the pelvis and mid -line of the abdomen, 
the middle one or internal oblique is on the same plane as the ribs, . 
and its fibres run downward and backward, while the transversalis 



MUSCULAR SYSTEM 



55 



is attached to the deep surfaces of the ribs, and its fibres run horizon- 
tally forward. Below, all these muscles are attached to the crest of 
the ilium and to Poupart's ligament, which is really the lower free 
edge of the external oblique, while, behind, the two deeper ones, 
at all events, blend with the fascia lumborum. As they approach 
the mid*ventral line they become aponeurotic and form the sheath 
of the rectus. The rectus abdominis (fig. 6) is a flat muscular hand 
which runs up on each side of the linea alba or mid-ventral line of the 
abdomen from the pubis to the ribs and sternum. This muscle 
lias certain tendinous intersections or lineae transversae, the positions 



rotating muscles pass from the scapula > to the upper end of the 
humerus; these are the subscapularis passing in front of the shoulder 
joint, the supraspinatus above the joint, and the infraspinatus and 
teres minor behind. The teres major (fig. 5) comes from near the 
lower angle of the scapula, and is inserted with the latissimus dorsi 
into the front of the surgical neck of the humerus. The coraco- 
brachial (fig. 7) passes from the coracoid process to the middle of 
the humerus in front of the shoulder joint, while the brachialis 
anticus passes in front of the elbow from the humerus to the coronoid 
process of the ulna. Passing in front of both shoulder and elbow is 



Sterno-mastoid 




of which are noticed in the article Anatomy {Superficial and Artistic), 
and the morphology of which is referred to later. In front of the 
lowest part of the rectus is sometimes a small triangular muscle 
called the pyramidalis. The quadratus lumborum is a muscle at the 
back of the abdominal wall which runs between the last rib and the 
crest of the ilium. In front of the bodies of the vertebrae is a 
prevertebral or hypaxial musculature, of which the rectus capitis 
anticus major and minor muscles and longus colli in the neck and the 
psoas in the loins form the chief parts, the latter being familiar as 
the undercut of the sirloin of beef, while the pelvis is closed below by 
a muscular floor formed by the levator ani and coccygeus muscles. 
The diaphragm is explained in a separate article. 
t Muscles of the Upper Extremity.— The deltoid (see figs.7and8) 
is the muscle which forms the shoulder cap and is used in abducting 
the arm to a right angle with the trunk; it runs from the clavicle, 
acromial process and spine of the scapula, to the middle of the 
humerus, and is supplied by the circumflex nerve. Several short 



the biceps (fig. 7), the long head of which rises from the top of the 
glenoid cavity inside the joint, while the short head comes from the 
coracoid process. The insertion is into the tubercle of the radius. 
These three muscles are all supplied by the same (musculocutaneous) 
nerve. At the back of the arm is the triceps^ (fig. 8) which passes 
behind both shoulder and elbow joints and is the great extensor 
muscle of them; its lon£ head rises from just below the glenoid 
cavity of the scapula, while the inner and outer heads come from the 
back of the humerus. It is inserted into the olecranon process of 
the ulna and is supplied by the musculo-spinal nerve. The muscles 
of the front of the forearm form superficial and deep sets (see fig. 7). 
Most of the superficial muscles come from the internal condyle of 
the humerus. From without inward they are the pronator radii 
teres going to the radius, the flexor carpi radialis to the base of the 
index metacarpal bone, the palmaris longus to the palmar fascia, 
the flexor sublimis digitorum to the middle phalanges of the fingers, 
and the flexor carpi ulnaris to the pisiform bone. The important

points of practical interest about these muscles are noticed in the 
article Anatomy {Superficial and Artistic), In addition to these 
the brachio-radialis is a flexor of the forearm, though it arises from 
the outer supracondylar ridge of the humerus. It is supplied by the 
musculo-spiral nerve, the flexor carpi ulnaris by the ulnar, the rest 
by the median. The deep muscles of the front of the forearm consist 
of the flexor longus pollicis running from the radius to the terminal 
phalanx of the thumb, the flexor profundus digitorum from the ulna 
to the terminal phalanges of the fingers, and the pronator quadratus

passing across from the lower third of the ulna to the same amount 
of the radius. These three muscles are supplied by the anterior 
interosseous branch of the median nerve, but the flexor profundus 
digitorum has an extra twig from the ulnar. The extensor muscles 
at the back of the forearm are also divided into superficial and deep 
sets (see fig. 8). The former rise from the region of the external 
condyle of the humerus, and consist of the extensor carpi radialis 
longior and brevior inserted into the index and medius metacarpal 
bones, the extensor communis digitorum to the middle and distal 



phalanges of the fingers, the extensor minimi digiti, the extensor carpi 
ulnaris passing to the metatarsal bone of the minimus, and the 
supinator brevis wrapping round the neck of the radius to which it 
is inserted. The aconeus which runs from the external condyle to 
the olecranon process is really a part of the triceps. The deep 
muscles rise from the posterior surfaces of the radius and ulna, and 
are the extensor ossis metacarpi pollicis, the name of which gives its 
insertion, the extensor brevis pollicis to the proximal phalanx, and 
the extensor longus pollicis to the distal phalanx of the thumb, while

the extensor indicis joins the extensor communis slip to the index 
finger; all these posterior muscles are supplied by the posterior 
interosseous nerve. In front and behind the wrist the tendons are 
bound down by the anterior and posterior annular ligaments, while 
on the flexor surface of each finger is a strong fibrous sheath or theca 
for the flexor tendons. The ball of the thumb is occupied by short 
muscles called the thenar group, while hypotkenar muscles are found 
in the ball of the little finger. The four lumbrical muscles (fig. Q> «) 
run from the flexor profundus digitorum tendons to those of the

extensor communis between the heads of the metacarpal bones, 
while, rising from the shafts of these bones, are the three palmar 
and four dorsal interosseous muscles (fig. 9, e) which also are inserted 
into the extensor tendons. The two outer lumbricals and the 
thenar muscles are supplied by the median nerve; all the other hand 
muscles by the ulnar. 

Muscles of the Lower Extremity. — On the front of the thigh 
the quadriceps extensor muscles are the most important: there are 
four of these, the rectus femoris (fig. 1) with its straight and reflected 
heads rising from just above the acetabulum, the crureus, deep to 
this, from the front of the femur, and the vastus externus and internus 
wrapping round the femur on each side from the linea aspera. All 
these are inserted into the patella, or rather the patella is a sesamoid 
bone developed where their common tendon passes round the lower

end of the femur when the knee is bent. The distal part of this 
tendon, which passes from the patella to the tubercle of the tibia, 
is the ligamentum patellae. The sartorius is a long riband-like 
muscle running from the anterior superior spine of the ilium to the 
inner surface of the tibia, obliquely across the front of the thigh. 
. It forms the outer boundary of Scarpa's triangle, the inner limit of 
which is the adductor longus and the base Poupart's ligament. 
The floor is formed by the xliacus from the iliac fossa of the pelvis, 
which joins the psoas, to be inserted with it into the lesser trochanter, 
and by the pectineus running from the upper ramus of the pubis to 
just below the insertion of the last muscles. The adductor muscles, 
longus, brevis and magnus, all rise from the subpubic arch, and are 
inserted into the linea aspera of the femur, so that they draw the 
femur toward the middle line. The gracilis (fig. 10) is part of the 
adductor mass, though its insertion is into the upper part of the 
tibia. The extensor muscles of the front of the thigh are supplied 
by the anterior crural nerve, but the adductor group on the inner 
side from the obturator. The pectineus is often supplied from both 
sources. On the back of the thigh the gluteus maximus (figs. 5 and 
10) plays an important part in determining man's outline (see 
Anatomy: Superficial and Artistic). It rises from the sacral region, 
and is inserted into the upper part of the femur and the deep fascia 
of the thigh, which is very thick and is known as the fascia lata; 
the muscle is a great extensor of the hip^ and raises the body from the 
stooping position. The gluteus medius rises from the ilium, above the 
hip joint, and passes to the great trochanter; it abducts the hip and 
enables the body to be balanced on one leg, as in taking a step for- 
ward. The gluteus minimus is covered by the last muscle, and passes 
from the ilium to the front of the great trochanter, thus rotating the 
hip joint inward. Some of its anterior fibres are sometimes separate 
from the rest, and are then called the scansorius (see Joints). 
When the gluteus maximus is removed, a number of short externally 
rotating muscles are seen, rising from the pelvis and inserted into 
the great trochanter (fig. 10) ; these are, from above downward, the 
pyriformis, gemellus superior, obturator internus, gemellus inferior 
and quadratus femoris. They are all supplied by special branches of 
the sacral plexus. On cutting the quadratus femoris a good deal of 
the obturator externus can be seen, coming from the outer surface 
of the obturator membrane and passing to the digital fossa of the 
great trochanter. Unlike the rest of this group, it is supplied by the 
obturator nerve. Coming from the anterior part of the crest of the 
ilium is the tensor fasciae femoris, which is inserted into the fascia 
lata, as is part of the gluteus maximus, and the thickened band of 
fascia which runsdown the outer side of the thigh from these to the 
head of the tibia is known as the ilio tibial band. The tensor fasciae 
femoris, gluteus medius and minimus, are supplied by the superior 
gluteal nerve, the gluteus maximus by the inferior gluteal. At the 
back of the thigh are the hamstrings rising from the tuberosity of the 
ischium (fig. 10); these are the semimembranosus and semitendinosus, 
passing to the inner part of the upper end ol the tibia and forming 
the internal hamstrings, and the biceps femoris or external hamstring, 
which has an extra head from the shaft of the femur and is inserted 
into the head of the fibula. These muscles are supplied by the great 
sciatic nerve and extend the hip joint while they flex the knee. In 
the leg, as distinguished from the thigh, are three groups of muscles, 
anterior, external and posterior. The anterior group (fig. 11) all 
come from the front of the tibia and fibula, and consist of the 
extensor longus digitorum, extending the middle and distal phalanges 
of the four outer toes, the extensor proprius hallucis, extending the 



big toe, and the peroneus tertius, a purely human muscle inserted 
into the base of the fifth metatarsal bone. All these are supplied by 
the anterior tibial nerve. 

The external group comprises the peroneus longus and brevis, 
rising from the outer surface of the fibula and inserted into the 
tarsus (fig. 11), the longus tendon passing across the sole to the base 
of the first metatarsal bone, the brevis to the base of the fifth 
metatarsal. These are supplied by the musculocutaneous nerve.

The posterior group is* divided into a superficial and a deep set. 
The superficial is composed of the gastrocnemius, the two heads of 
which rise from the two condyles of the femur, the soleus, which rises 
from the upper parts of the back of the tibia and fibula, the plantaris, 
which comes from just above the external condyle of the femur, 
and the popliteus which, although on a deeper plane, really belongs 
to this group and rises by a tendon from the outer condyle while its 
fleshy part is inserted into the upper part of the back of the tibia. 
The gastrocnemius and soleus unite to form the tendo Achillis, which 
is attached to the posterior part of the calcaneum, while the plantaris 
runs separately as a very thin tendon to the same place. These 
muscles are supplied by the internal popliteal nerve. The deep set 
is formed by three muscles which rise from the posterior surfaces of 
the tibia and fibula, the flexor longus digitorum, 'the tibialis posticus,

and the flexor longus hallucis from within outward. Their tendons 
all pass into the sole, that of the flexor longus digitorum being 
inserted into the terminal phalanges of the four outer toes, the flexor 
longus hallucis into the terminal phalanx of the big toe, while the 
tibialis posticus sends expansions to most of the tarsal bones. The 
nerve supply of this group is the posterior tibial. On the dorsum of 
the foot is the extensor brevis digitorum (fig. 1 i), which helps to extend

the four inner toes, while in the sole are four layers of short muscles, 
the most superficial of which consists of the abductor hallucis, the 
flexor brevis digitorum, and the abductor minimi digiti, the names of 
which indicate their attachments. The second layer is formed by 
muscles which are attached to the flexor longus digitorum tendon; 
they are the accessorius, running forward to the tendon from the 
lower surface of the calcaneum, and the four lumbricales, which rise 
from the tendon after it has split for the four toes and pass 
between the toes to be inserted into the tendons of the extensor 
longus digitorum on the dorsum. The third layer comprises the 
flexor brevis hallucis, adductor obliquus and adductor transversus 
hallucis and the flexor brevis minimi digiti. The fourth layer contains 
the three plantar and four dorsal interosseous muscles, rising from 
tHe metatarsal bones and inserted into the proximal phalanges 
and extensor tendons in such a way that the plantar muscles draw 
the toes towards the line of the second toe while the dorsal draw 
them away from that line. Of these sole muscles the flexor brevis 
digitorum, flexor brevis hallucis, abductor hallucis and the innermost 
lumbrical are supplied by the internal plantar nerve, while all the 
rest are supplied by the external plantar. 



Embryology. 
The, development of the muscular system is partly known from 
the results of direct observation, and partly inferred from the study 
of the part of the nervous system whence the innervation is derived. 
The unstriped muscteis formed from the mesenchyme cells of the 
somatic and splanchnic layers of the mesoderm (see Embryology), 
but never, as far as we know, from the mesodermic somites. The 
heart muscle is also developed from mesenchymal cells, though the 
changes producing its feebly striped fibres are more complicated. 
The skeletal or real striped muscles are derived either from tne meso- 
dermic somites or from the branchial arches. As the mesodermic 
somites are placed on each side of the neural canal in the early- 
embryo, it is obvious that the greater part of the trunk musculature 
spreads gradually round the body from the dorsal to the ventral 
side and consists of a scries of plates called myotomes (fig. 12). The 
muscle fibres in these plates run in the long axis of the embryo, and 
are at first separated from those of the two neighbouring plates by 
thin fibrous intervals called myocommata. In some cases these

myocommata persist and even become ossified, as in the ribs, but 
more usually they disappear early, and the myotomes then unite with 
one another to form a great muscular sheet. In the whole length of the 
trunk a longitudinal cleavage at right angles to the surface occurs, 
splitting the musculature into a dorsal and ventral part, supplied 
respectively by the dorsal and ventral primary divisions of the spinal 
nerves. From the dorsal part the various muscles of the erector 
spinae scries are derived by further longitudinal cleavages either 
tangential or at right angles to the surface, while the ventral part 
is again longitudinally split into mesial and lateral portions. A 
transverse section of the trunk at this stage, therefore, would show 
the cut ends of three longitudinal strips of muscle: (1) z. mesial 
ventral, from which the rectus, pyramidalis sterno-hyoid, omo- 
hyoid and sterno-thyroid muscles are derived ; (2) a lateral ventral, 
forming the flat muscles of the abdomen, intercostals and part of 
the sternomastoid and trapezius; and (3) the dorsal portion already 
noticed. The mesial ventral part is remarkable for the persistence 
of remnants of myocommata in it, forming the lincae transversa* 
of the rectus and the central tendon of the omo-hvoid. The lateral 
part in the abdominal region splits tangcntially into three layers, 



MUSES, THE

the external and internal oblique and the transversalis, the fibres 
of which become differently directed. In the thoracic region the 
intercostals probably indicate a further tangential splitting of the 
middle or internal oblique layer, because the external oblique is 
continued headward supericially to the ribs and the transversalis 
deeply to them. The more cephalic part of the external oblique 
layer probably disappears by a process of pressure or crowding out 
•owing to the encroachment of the serratus magnus, a muscle which 
its nerve supply indicates is derived from the lower cervical myo- 
tomes. The deeper parts of the lateral mass of muscles spread to 
the ventral surface of the bodies of the vertebrae, and form the 
hypaxial muscles — such as the psoas, longus colli and recti capitis 
antici. The nerve supply indicates that the lowest myotomes taking 
part in the formation of the abdominal walls are those supplied by 
the first and second lumbar nerves, and arc represented by the 
cremaster muscle in the scrotum. In the perineum, however, the 
third and fourth sacral myotomes are represented, and these muscles 
are differentiated largely from the primitive sphincter which sur- 
rounds the cloacal orifice, though partly from vestigial tail muscles 
(see P. Thompson, Journ. Anal* and Phys., vol. xxxv; and R. H. 
Paramore, Lancet, May 21, 1910). In the head no distinct myotomes 
have been demonstrated in the mammalian embryo, but as they are 
present in more lowly vertebrates, it is probable that their develop- 
ment has been slurred over, a process often found in the embryology 
of the higher forms. Probably nine cephalic myotomes originally 
existed; of which the first gives rise to the eye muscles supplied by 
the third nerve, the second to the superior obliaue muscle supplied 
by the fourth nerve, and the 'third to the external rectus supplied by 
the sixth nerve. The fourth, fifth and sixth myotomes are sup- 
pressed, but the seventh, eighth and ninth possibly form the muscles 
of the tongue supplied by the twelfth cranial nerve. 

Turning now to the branchial arches, the first branchiomere is 
innervated by the fifth cranial nerve, and to it belong the masseter, 
temporal, pterygoids, anterior belly of the digastric, mylo-hyoid, 
tensor tympani and tensor palati, while from the second branchio- 
mere, supplied by the seventh or facial nerve, all the facial muscles 
of expression and the stylo-hyoid and posterior belly of the digastric 
are derived, as well as the platysma, which is one of the few remnants 
of the panniculus carnosus or skin musculature of the lower mam- 
mals. From the third branchiomere, the nerve of which is the ninth 
or glossopharyngeal, the stylo-pharyngeus and upper part of the 
pharyngeal constrictors are formed, while the fourth and fifth gill 
arches give rise to the muscles of the larynx and the lower part of 
the constrictors supplied by the vagus or tenth nerve. It is possible 
that parts of the sterno-mastoid and trapezius are also branchial 
in their origin, since they are supplied by the spinal accessory or 
eleventh nerve, but this is unsettled. The limb musculature is 
usually regarded as a sleeve-like outpushing of the external oblique 
stratum of the lateral ventral musculature of the trunk, and it is 
believed that parts of several myotomes are in this way pushed out 
in- the growth of the limb bud. This process actually occurs in the 
lower vertebrates, and the nerve supplies provide strong presumptive 
evidence .that this is the real phylogenetic history of the higher forms, 
though direct observation shows that the limb muscles of mammals 
are formed from the central mesoderm of the limb and at first are 
cuiite distinct from the myotomes of the trunk. A possible explana- 
tion of the difficulty is that this is another example of the slurring 
over of stages in phylogeny, but this is one of many obscure morpho- 
logical points. The muscles of each limb are divided into a dorsal 
and ventral series, supplied by dorsal and ventral secondary divisions 
of the nerves in the limb plexuses, and these correspond to the original 
position of the limbs as they grow out froni the embryo, so that in 
the upper extremity the back of the arm, forearm and dorsum of the 
hand are dorsal, while in the lower the dorsal surface is the front of 
the thigh and leg and the dorsum of the foot.

Comparative Anatomy. 

In the acrania (e.g. amphioxus) the simple arrangement of myo- 
tomes and myocommata seen in the early human embryo is perma- 
nent. The myotomes or muscle plates are < shaped, with their 
apices pointing towards the head end, each being supplied by its 
own spinal nerve. In the fishes this arrangement is largely persis- 
tent, but each limb of the < is bent on itself, so that the myotomes 
have now the shape of a 5» the central angle of which corresponds 
to the lateral line of the fish. In the abdominal region, however, 
the myotomes fuse and rudiments of the recti and obliqui abdominis 
muscles of higher types are seen. In other regions too, such as the 
fins of fish and the tongue of the Cyclostomata (lamprey), specialized 
muscular bundles are separated off and are coincident with the 
acquirement of movements of these parts in different directions. 
In the Amphibia the limb musculature becomes much more complex 
as the joints are formed, and many of the muscles can be homologizcd 
with those of mammals, though this is by no means always the case, 
while, in the abdominal region, a superficial delamination occurs, 
so that in many forms a superficial and deep rectus abdominis occurs 
as well as a cutaneus abdominis .delaminated from the external 
oblique. It is probable that this delamination is the precursor of 



the panniculus carnosus or skin musculature of mammals. The 
branchial musculature also becomes much more complex, and the 
mylo-hyoid muscle, derived from the first branchial arch and lying 
beneath the floor of the mouth, is very noticeable and of great 
importance in breathing. 

In the reptiles further differentiation of the muscles is seen, and 
with the acquirement of costal respiration the external and internal 
intercostals are formed by a delamination of the internal oblique 
stratum. In the dorsal region several of the longitudinal muscles 
which together make up the erector spinae are distinct, and a very 
definite sphincter cloacae is formed round and cloacal aperture. 
In mammals certain muscles vary in their attachments or presence 
and absence in different orders, sub-orders and families, so that, 
were it not for the large amount of technical knowledge required 
in recognizing them, they .might be useful from a classificatory point 
of view. There is, however, a greater gap between the musculature 
of Man and that of the other Primates than there is between many 
different orders, and this is usually traceable either directly or 
indirectly to the assumption of the erect position. 

The chief causes which produce changes of musculature are: 
(1) splitting, (2) fusion, (3) suppression either partial or complete, 
(4) shifting of origin, (5) shifting of insertion, (6) new formation, 
(7) transference of part of one muscle to another. In many of these 
cases the nerve supply gives an important clue to the change which 
has been effected. Splitting of a muscular mass is often the result 
of one part of a muscle being used separately, and a good example 
of this is the deep flexor mass of the forearm. In the lower mammals 
this mass rises from the flexor surface of the radius and ulna, and 
supplies tendons to the terminal phalanges of all five digits, but in 
man the thumb is used separately, and, jn response to this, that 
part*f the mass which goes to the thumb is completely split off into 
a separate muscle, the flexor longus pollicis. The process, however, 
is going farther, for we have acquired the habit of using our index 
finger alone^ for many purposes, and the index slip of the flexor 

f>rofundus digitorum is in us almost as distinct a muscle as the flexor 
ongus pollicis. Fusion may be either collateral or longitudinal. 
The former is seen in the case of the flexor carpi ulnaris. In many 
mammals (e.g. the dog), there are two muscles inserted separately 
into the pisiform bone, one rising from the internal condyle of the 
humerus, the other from the olecranon process, but in many others 
(e.g. man) the two muscles have fused. Longitudinal fusion is seen 
in the digastric, where the anterior belly is part of the first (man- 
dibular) branchial arch and the posterior of the second or hyoid arch ; 
in this case, as one would expect, the anterior belly is supplied by 
the fifth nerve and the posterior by the seventh. Partial suppression 
of a muscle is seen in the rhomboid sheet; in the lower mammals 
this rises from the head, neck and anterior (cephalic) thoracic spines, 
but in man the head and most of the neck part is completely sup- 
pressed. Complete suppression of a muscle is exemplified in the 
omo-trachelian, a muscle which runs from the cervical vertebrae 
to the acromian process and fixes the scapula for the strong action 
of the triceps in pronograde mammals; in man this strong action 
of the triceps is no longer needed for progression, and the fixing 
muscle has disappeared. Shifting of origin is seen in the short head 
of the biceps femoris. This in many lower mammals (e.g. rabbit) 
is a muscle running from the tail to the lower leg; in many others 
(e.g. monkeys and man) theorigin has slipped down to the femur, 
and in the great anteater it is evident that the agitator caudae has 
been useo! as a muscle slide, because the short head of the biceps 
or tenuissimus has once been found rising from the surface of this 
muscle. ^ Shifting of an insertion is not nearly as common as shifting 
of an origin; it is seen, however, in the peroneus tertius of man, in 
which part of the extensor longus digitorum has acquired a new 
attachment to the base of the fifth metatarsal bone. The new 
formation of a muscle is seen in the stylo-kyoideus alter, an occasional 
human muscle; in this the stylo-hyoid ligament has been converted 
into a muscle. The transference of part of one muscle to another 
is well shown by the human adductor magnus; here the fibres which 
pass from the tuber ischii to the condyle of the femur have a nerve 
supply from the great sciatic instead of the obturator, and in most 
lower mammals are a separate part of the hamstrings known as the 
presemimembranosus.

MUSES, THE (Gr. MoB<roi, the thinkers), in Greek myth- 
ology, originally nymphs of springs, then goddesses of song, and, 
later, of the different kinds of poetry and of the arts and sciences 
generally. In Homer, who says nothing definite as to their 
names or number, they are simply goddesses of song, who dwell 
among the gods on Olympus, where they sing at their banquets 
under the leadership of Apollo Musagetes. According to Hesiod 
(Theog. 77), who first gives the usually accepted names and 
number, they were the daughters of Zeus and Mnemosyne, the 
personification of memory; others made them children of

Uranus and Gaea. Three older Muses (Mneme, Melete, Aoide) 
were sometimes distinguished, whose worship was said to have 
been introduced by the Aloidae on Mt Helicon (Pausanias ix. 29). 
It is probable that three was the original number of the 
Muses, which was increased to nine owing to their arrangement 
in three groups of three in the sacred choruses. Round the 
altar of Zeus they sing of the origin of the world, of gods and men, 
of the glorious deeds of Zeus; they also honour the great heroes; 
and celebrate the marriages of Cadmus and Peleus, and the 
death of Achilles. As goddesses of song they protect those who 
recognize their superiority, but punish the arrogant — such as 
Thamyris, the Thracian bard, who for having boasted himself 
their equal was deprived of sight and the power of song. From 
their connexion with Apollo and their original nature as inspiring 
nymphs of springs they also possess the gift of prophecy. They 
are closely related to Dionysus, to whose festivals dramatic 
poetry owed its origin and development. The worship of the 
Muses had two chief seats — on the northern slope of Mt 
Olympus in Pieria, and on the slope of Mt Helicon near 
Ascra and Thespiae in Boeotia. Their favourite haunts were the 
springs of Castalia, Aganippe and Hippocrene. From Boeotia 
their cult gradually spread over Greece. As the goddesses who 
presided over the nine principal departments of letters, their 
names and attributes were: Calliope, epic poetry (wax tablet and 
pencil); Euterpe, lyric poetry (the double flute); Erato, trotic 
poetry (a small lyre) ; Melpomene, tragedy (tragic mask and ivy 
wreath); Thalia, comedy (comic mask and ivy wreath); Poly- 
hymnia (or Polymnia), sacred hymns (veiled, and in an attitude 
of thought); Terpsichore, choral song and the dance (the lyre); 
Clio, history (a scroll); Urania, astronomy (a celestial globe). 
To these Arethusa was added as the muse of pastoral poetry. 
The Roman poets identified the Greek Muses with the Italian 
Camenae (or Casmenae), prophetic nymphs of springs and god- 
desses of birth, who possessed a grove near the Porta Capena 
at Rome. One of the most famous of these was Egeria, the 
counsellor of King Numa.

but contain many details of a singer's life. Colin shows naive 
gratitude for presents in kind from his patrons, and recommends 
a poet repulsed by a cruel mistress to find consolation in the 
bons morceaux qu'on mange devant un grand feu. One of his 
patrons was Agnes de Bar, duchess of Lorraine (d. 1226).

MUSEUMS OF ART. 1 The later 19th century was remarkable 
for the growth and development of museums, both in Great 
Britain and abroad. This growth, as Professor Stanley Jevons 
predicted, synchronizes with the advancement of education. 
Public museums are now universally required; old institutions 
have been greatly improved, and many new ones have been 
founded. The British parliament has passed statutes conferring 
upon local authorities the power to levy rates for library and 
museum purposes, while on the continent of Europe the collection 
and exhibition of objects of antiquity and art has become a 
recognized duty of the state and municipality alike. 

A sketch of the history of museums in general is given below, 
under Museums of Science. The modern museum of art differs 
essentially from its earlier prototypes. The aimless collection 
of curiosities and bric-a-brac, brought together without method 

1 Under the term " museum " (Gr. /iow-clop, temple of the muses) 
wc accept the ordinary distinction, by which it covers a collection of 
all sorts of art objects, while an art gallery (q.v.) confines itself 
practically to pictures. 



or system, was the feature of certain famous collections in by- 
gone days, of which the Tradescant Museum, formed in the 17th 
century, was a good example. This museum was a miscellany 
without didactic value; it contributed nothing to the advance- 
ment of art; its arrangement was unscientific, and the public 
gained little or no advantage from its existence. The modern 
museum, on the other hand, should be organized for the public 
good, and should be a fruitful source of amusement and instruc- 
tion to the whole community. Even when Dr Waagen described 
the collections of England, about 1840, private individuals 
figured chiefly among the owners of art treasures. Nowadays in 
making a record of this nature the collections belonging to the 
public would attract most attention. This fact is becoming more 
obvious every year. Not only are acquisitions of great value 
constantly made, but the principles of museum administration 
and development are being more closely defined. What Sir 
William Flower, an eminent authority, called the " new museum 
idea " (Essays mt Museums, p. 37) is pervading the treatment of 
all the chief museums of the world. Briefly stated, the new 
principle of museum development — first enunciated in 1870, but 
now beginning to receive general support — is that the first aim of 
public collections shall be education, and their second recreation. 
To be of teaching value, museum arrangement and classification 
must be carefully studied. Acquisitions must be added to their 
proper sections; random purchase of " curios " must be avoided. 
Attention must be given to the proper display and cataloguing 
of the exhibits, to their housing and preservation, to the lighting, 
comfort and ventilation of the galleries. Furthermore, facilities 
must be allowed to those who wish to make special study of 
the objects on view. " A museum is like a living organism: 
it requires continual and tender care; it must grow, or it will 
perish " (Flower, p. 13). 

Great progress has been made in the classification of objects, 
a highly important branch of museum work. There are three 
possible systems — namely, by date, by material and 
by nationality. It has been found possible to tl&Bt ca- 
combine the systems to some extent;' for instance, 
in the ivory department of the Victoria and Albert Museum, 
South Kensington, London, where the broad classification is 
by material, the objects being further subdivided according to 
their age, and in a minor degree according to their nationality. 
But as yet there is no general preference of one system to another. 
Moreover, the principles of classification are not easily laid down; 
e.g. musical instruments: should they be included in art exhibits 
or in the ethnographical section to which they also pertain? 
Broadly speaking, objects must be classified according to the 
quality (apart from their nature) for which they are most remark- 
able. Thus a musket or bass viol of the 16th century, inlaid 
with ivory and highly decorated, would be properly included in 
the art section, whereas a 'common flute or weapon, noteworthy 
for nothing but its interest as an instrument of music or destruc- 
tion, would be suitably classified as ethnographic. In England, 
at any rate, there is no uniformity cf practice in this respect, 
and though it is to be hoped that the ruling desire to classify 
according to strict scientific rules may not become too preva- 
lent, it would nevertheless be a distinct advantage if, in one or 
more of the British museums, some attempt were made to 
illustrate the growth of domestic arts and crafts according to 
classification by date. Examples of this classification in Munich, 
Amsterdam, Basel, Zurich and elsewhere afford excellent lessons 
of history and art, a series of rooms being fitted up to show 
in chronological order the home life of our ancestors. In the 
National Museum of Bavaria (Munich) there is a superb suite of 
rooms illustrating the progress of art from Merovingian times 
down to the 19th century. Thus classification, though studied, 
must not check the elasticity of art museums; it should not be 
allowed to interfere with the mobility of the exhibits— that is to 
say, it should always be possible to withdraw specimens for the 
closer inspection of students, and also to send examples on loan 
to other museums and schools of art — an jnvaluable system long 
in vogue at the Victoria and Albert Museum, and one which 
should be still more widely adopted. An axiom of museum law 



MUSEUMS OF ART

is that the exhibits shall be properly- shown. " The value of a 
museum is to be tested by the treatment of its contents " 
(Flower, p. 24). But in many museums the chief hindrance to 
study and enjoyment is overcrowding of exhibits. Although 
a truism, it is necessary to state that each object should be 
properly seen, cleaned and safeguarded; but all over the world 
this rule is forgotten. The rapid acquisition of objects is one 
cause of overcrowding, but a faulty appreciation of the didactic 
purpose of the collection is more frequently responsible. 

In Great Britain, museum progress is satisfactory. Visitors 
are numbered by millions, access is now permitted on Sundays 

and week-days alike, and entrance fees are being con- 
^J^/^sistently reduced; in this the contrast between Great 

Britain and some foreign countries is singular. A 
generation or so ago the national collections of Italy used to be 
always open to the public. Pay-days, however, were gradually 
established, with the result that the chief collections are now 
only visible without payment on Sundays. In Dresden payment 
is obligatory five days a week. The British Museum never 
charges for admission. On the other hand, the increase in 
continental collections is more rapid than in Great Britain, where 
acquisitions are only made by gift, purchase or bequest. In 
other European . countries enormous collections have been 
obtained by revolutions and conquest, by dynastic changes, and 
by secularizing religious foundations. Some of the chief 
treasures of provincial museums in France were spoils of the 
Napoleonic armies, though the great bulk of this loot was returned 
in 181 5 to the original owners. In Italy the conversion of a 
monastery into a museum is a simple process, the Dominican 
house of San Marco in Florence offering a typical example. A 
further stimulus to the foundation of museums on the continent 
is the comparative ease with which old buildings are obtained 
and adapted for the collections. Thus the Germanisches Museum 
of Nuremberg is a secularized church and convent; the enormous 
collections belonging to the town of Ravenna are housed in an 
old Camaldulensian monastery. At Louvain and Florence 
municipal palaces of great beauty are used; at Nimes a famous 
Roman temple; at Urbino the grand ducal palace, and so on. 
There are, however, certain disadvantages in securing both 
building and collection ready-made, and the special care devoted 
to museums in Great Britain can be traced to the fact that their 
cost to the community is considerable. Immense sums have 
been spent on the buildings alone, nearly a million sterling being 
devoted to the new buildings for the Victoria and Albert Museum 
in London. Had it been possible to secure them without such 
an outlay the collections themselves would have been much 
increased, though in this increase itself there would have been a 
danger, prevalent but not yet fully realized in other countries, 
of crowding the vacant space with specimens of inferior quality. 
The result is that fine things are badly seen owing to the masses 
of second-rate examples; moreover, the ample space available 
induces the authorities to remove works of art from their original 
places, in order to add them to the museums. Thus the statue 
of St George by Donatello has been taken from the church of Or 
San Michele at Florence (on the plea of danger from exposure), 
and is now placed in a museum where, being dwarfed and under 
cover, its chief artistic value is lost. The desire to make financial 
profit from works of art is a direct cause of the modern museum 
movement in Italy. One result is to displace and thus depreciate 
many works of art, beautiful in their original places, but quite 
insignificant when put into a museum. Another result is that, 
owing to high entrance fees, the humbler class of Italians can 
rarely see the art treasures of their own country. There are 
other collections, akin to art museums, which would best be 
called biographical museums. They illustrate the life and work 
of great artists or authors. Of these the most notable are the 
museums commemorating Diirer at Nuremberg, Beethoven at 
Bonn, Thorwaldsen at Copenhagen, Shakespeare at Stratford 
and Michelangelo at Florence. The sacristies of cathedrals often 
contain ecclesiastical objects of great value, and are shown 
to the public as museums. Cologne, Aachen, Milan, Monza and 
Reims have famous treasuries. Many Italian cathedrals have 



small museums attached to them, usually known as " Opera del 
Duomo." 

United Kingdom. — The influence and reputation of the British 
Museum are so great that its original purpose, as stated in the 
preamble of the act by which it was founded (1753, 
c. 22), may be quoted: " Whereas all arts and sciences ^Ifstum. 
have a connexion with each other, and discoveries 
in natural philosophy and other branches of speculative know- 
ledge, for the advancement and improvement whereof the said 
museum or collection was intended, do, or may in many instances 
give help and success to the most useful experiments and under- 
takings . . ." The "said museum" above mentioned referred 
to the collection of Sir Hans Sloane, to be purchased under the 
act just quoted. Sir Hans Sloane is therein stated, " through 
the course of many years, with great labour and expense, to 
have gathered together whatever could be procured, either in 
our own or foreign countries, that was rare and curious." In 
order to buy his collections and found the museum a lottery of 
£300,000 was authorized, divided into 50,000 tickets, the prizes 
varying from £10 to £10,000. Provision was made for the 
adequate housing of Sir Robert Cotton's books, already bought in 
1700 (12 and 13 Will. III. c. 7). This act secured for the nation 
the famous Cottonian manuscripts, "of great use and service for 
the knowledge and preservation of our constitution, both in 
church and state." Sir Robert's grandson had preserved the 
collection with great care, and was willing that it should not be 
" disposed of or embeziled," and that it should be preserved for 
public use and advantage. This act also sets forth the oath to 
be sworn by the keeper, and deals with the appointment of 
trustees. This is still the method of internal government at the 
British Museum, and additions to the Board of Trustees are made 
by statute, as in 1824, in acknowledgment of a bequest. The 
trustees are of three classes: (a) three principal trustees, namely 
the Primate, the Lord Chancellor and the Speaker; (b) general 
trustees, entitled ex officio to the position in virtue of ministerial 
office; (c) family, bequest and nominated trustees. A standing 
committee of the trustees meets regularly at the museum for the 
transaction of business. The great departments of the museum 
(apart from the scientific and zoological collections, now placed 
in the museum in' Cromwell Road, South Kensington) are of 
printed books, MSS., Oriental books, prints and drawings, 
Egyptian and Assyrian antiquities, British and medieval 
antiquities, coins and medals. Each of these eight departments 
is under a keeper, with an expert staff of subordinates, the head 
executive officer of the whole museum being styled director and 
chief librarian. The museum has been enriched by bequests 
of great importance, especially in the library. Recent legacies 
have included the porcelain bequeathed by Sir Wollaston Franks, 
and the valuable collection of works of art (chiefly enamels and 
gold-smithery) known as the Waddesdon bequest — a legacy of 
Baron F. de Rothschild. The most important group of acquisi- 
tion by purchase in the history of the museum is the scries of 
Greek sculptures known as the Elgin Marbles, bought by act of 
parliament (56 Geo. Ill, c. 99). 

There are four national museums controlled by the Board of 
Education, until recently styled the Department of Science and 
Art. The chief of these is the Victoria and Albert Museums of 
Museum at South Kensington. This museum has a theBoaniof 
dependency at Bethnal Green, the Dublin and Bducation * 
Edinburgh museums having been now removed from its direct 
charge. There is also a museum of practical geology in Jermyn 
Street, containing valuable specimens of pottery and majolica. 
The Victoria and Albert Museum owed its inception to the 
Exhibition of 1851, from the surplus funds of which 12 acres of 
land were bought in South Kensington. First known as the 
Department of Practical Art, the museum rapidly established 
itself on a broad basis. Acquisitions of whole collections and 
unique specimens were accumulated. In 1857 the Sheepshanks 
gallery of pictures was presented; in 1879 the India Office trans- 
ferred to the department the collection of Oriental art formerly 
belonging to the East India Company; in 1882 the Jones bequest 
of French furniture and decorative art (1740-1810) was received; 



62 



MUSEUMS OF ART 



in 1884 the Patent Museum was handed over to the department. 

Books, prints, MSS. and cjrawings were bequeathed by the Rev. 

A. Dyce and Mr John Forster. Meanwhile, gifts and purchases 

had combined to make the collection one of the most important 

in Europe. The chief features may be summarized as consisting 

of pictures, including the Raphael cartoons lent by the king; 

textiles, silks and tapestry; ceramics and enamels; ivory and 

plastic art, metal, furniture and Oriental collections. The 

guiding principle of the museum is the illustration of art applied 

to industry. Beauty and decorative attraction is perhaps the 

chief characteristic of tbe exhibits here, whereas the British 

Museum is largely archaeological. With this object in view, 

the museum possesses numerous reproductions of famous 

art treasures: casts, facsimiles and electrotypes, some of 

them so well contrived as to be almost indistinguishable 

from the originals. An art library with 75,000 volumes 

and 25,000 prints and photographs is at the disposal of 

students, and an art school is also attached to the museum. 

The museum does considerable work among provincial schools 

of art and museums, " circulation " being its function in 

this connexion. Works of art are sent on temporary loan to 

local museums, where they are exhibited for certain periods 

and on being withdrawn are replaced by fresh examples. The 

subordinate museum of the Beard of Education at Betbnal 

Green and that at Edinburgh call for no comment, their contents 

being of slender value. The Dublin Museum', though now 

controlled by the Irish Department, may be mentioned here as 

having been founded and worked by the Board of Education. 

Apart from the fact that it is one of the most suitably housed 

and organized museums in the British Isles, it is remarkable for 

its priceless collection of Celtic antiquities, belonging to the 

Royal Irish Academy, and transferred to the Kildare Street 

Museum in 1890. Among its most famous specimens of early 

Irish art may be mentioned the shrine and bell of St Patrick, 

the Tara brooch, the cross of Cong and the Ardagh chalice. The 

series of bronze and stone implements is most perfect, while 

the jewels, gold ornaments, torques, fibulae, diadems, and so 

forth are such that, were it possible again to extend the galleries 

(thus allowing further classification and exhibition space), the 

collection would surpass the Danish National Museum at 

Copenhagen, its chief rival in Europe.

and the examples of bronze, furniture, and porcelain 

are as fine as those to be seen in the Louvre. Hertford House, 
.however, also contains a most remarkable collection of armour, 
and the examples of Italian faience, enamels, bijouterie, &c, 
are of first-rate interest. The universities of Cambridge and 
Oxford have museums, the latter including the Ashmolean collec- 
tions, a valuable bequest of majolica from D. Fortnum, and some 
important classical statuary, now in the Taylorian Gallery. 
Christ Church has a small museum and picture gallery. Trinity 
College, Dublin, has a miniature archaeological collection, 
containing some fine examples of early Irish art. The National 
Museum of Antiquities of Scotland, controlled by the Board of 
Manufactures, was formed by the Scottish Society of Antiquaries, 
and has a comprehensive collection of Scottish objects, lay and 
religious. The Tower of London contains armour of historic 
and artistic interest, and the Royal College of Music has an 
invaluable collection of musical instruments, presented by Mr 
George Donaldson. Art museums are also to be found in several 
public schools in the United Kingdom. 

The Museums Act of 1845 enabled town councils to found and 
, maintain museums. This act was superseded by another passed 
Munid 1 in l8s °' by Mr William Ew art, which in its turn has 
Museums. keen replaced by amending statutes passed in 1855, 
1866, 1868 and 1885. The Museums and Gymna- 
siums Act of 1891 sanctioned the provision and maintenance of 



museums for the reception of local antiquities and other objects 
of interest, and allows a £d. rate, irrespective of other acts. 
Boroughs have also the right to levy special rates under private 
municipal acts, Oldham affording a case in point. Civic museums 
must still be considered to be in their infancy. Although 
the movement is now firmly established in municipal enterprise, 
the collections, taken as a whole, are still somewhat nondescript. 
In many cases collections have been handed over by local 
societies, particularly in geology, zoology and other scientific 
departments. There are about twelve museums in which Roman 
antiquities are noticeable, among them being Leicester, and the 
Civic Museum of London, at the Guildhall. British and Anglo- 
Saxon relics are important features at Sheffield and Liverpool; 
in the former case owing to the Bateman collection acquired in 
1876; while the Mayer collection presented to the latter city 
contains a highly important series of carved ivories. At Salford, 
Glasgow and Manchester industrial art is the chief feature of the 
collections. Birmingham, with perhaps the finest provincial 
collection of industrial art, is supported by the rates to the extent 
of £4200 a year. Its collections (including here, as in the majority 
of great towns, an important gallery of paintings) are entirely 
derived from gifts and bequests. Birmingham has made a 
reputation for special exhibitions of works of art lent for a time 
to tbe corporation. These loan exhibitions, about which 
occasional lectures are given, and of which cheap illustrated 
catalogues are issued, have largely contributed to the great 
popularity and efficiency of the museum. Liverpool, Preston, 
Derby and Sheffield owe their fine museum buildings to private 
generosity. Other towns have museums which are chiefly 
supported by subscriptions, e.g. Chester and Newcastle, where 
there is a fine collection of work by Bewick the engraver. At 
Exeter the library, museum, and art gallery, together with 
schools of science and art, are combined in one building. Other 
towns may be noted as having art museums: Stockport, Notting- 
ham (Wedgwood collection), Leeds, Bootle, Swansea, Bradford, 
Northampton (British archaeology), and Windsor. There are 
museums at Belfast, Larne, Kilkenny and Armagh. The cost 
of the civic museum, being generally computed with the mainten- 
ance of the free library, is not easily obtained. In many cases 
the librarian is also curator of the museum; elsewhere no curator 
at all is appointed, his work being done by a caretaker. In 
some museums there is no classification or cataloguing and 
the value of existing collections is impaired both by careless 
treatment and by the too ready acceptance of worthless 
gifts; often enough the museums are governed by committees 
of the corporation whose interest and experience are not 
great. 

Foreign Museums. — Art museums are far more numerous 
on the continent, of Europe than in England. In Germany 
progress has been very striking, their educational aspect being 
closely studied. In Italy public collections, which are ten times 
more numerous than in England, are chiefly regarded as financial 
assets. The best examples of classification are to be found 
abroad, at Vienna, Amsterdam, Zurich, Munich and Gizch in 
Egypt. The Mus6e Carnavalet, the historical collection of the 
city of Paris, is the most perfect civic museum in the world. 
The buildings in which the objects can be most easily studied are 
those of Naples, Berlin and Vienna. The value of the aggregate 
collections in any single country of the great powers, Russia 
excepted, probably exceeds the value of British collections. At 
the same time, it must be remembered that masses of foreign 
collections represent expropriations by the city and the state, 
together with the inheritance of royal and semi-royal collectors. 
In Germany and Italy, for instance, there are at least a dozen 
towns which at one time were capitals of principalities. In 
some countries the public holds over works of art the pre-emptive 
right of purchase. In Italy, under the law known as the Editto 
Pacca, it is illegal to export the more famous works of art. 
Speaking generally, the cost of maintaining municipal museums 
abroad is very small, many being without expert or highly-paid 
officials, while admission fees are often considerable. Nowhere 
in the United Kingdom are the collections neglected in a manner 



MUSEUMS OF ART

through which certain towns in Italy and Spain have gained an 
unenviable name. 

Berlin and Vienna have collections of untold richness, and the 
public are freely admitted. Berlin, besides its picture gallery 
Germany an d architectural museum, has a collection of Christian 
and antiquities in the university. The old museum, a 

Austria. royal foundation, is renowned for its classical sculp- 
ture and a remarkable collection of medieval statuary, in 
which Italian art is well represented. The new museum is 
also noteworthy for Greek marbles, and contains bronzes and 
engravings, together with one of the most typical collections of 
Egyptian art. Schliemann's discoveries are housed in the 
Ethnographic Museum. The Museum of Art and Industry, 
closely similar in object and arrangement to the Victoria and 
Albert Museum in London, contains collections of the same 
character — enamels, furniture, ceramics, &c. Vienna also has 
one of these museums (Kunstgewerbe), in which the great value 
of the examples is enhanced by their judicious arrangement. 
The Historical Museum of this city is interesting, and the 
Imperial Museum (of which the structure corresponds almost 
exactly with a plan of an ideal museum designed by Sir William 
Flower) is one of the most comprehensive extant, containing 
armour of world-wide fame and the choicest specimens of indus- 
trial art. Prague, Innsbruck and Budapest are respectively 
the homes of the national museums of Bohemia, Tirol and 
Hungary. The National Museum of Bavaria (Munich) has been 
completed, and its exhibition rooms, 100 in number, show the 
most recent methods of classification, Nuremberg, with upwards 
of eighty rooms, being its only rival in southern Germany. 
Mainz and Trier have Roman antiquities. Hamburg, Leipzig and 
Breslau have good " Kunstgewerbe " collections. In Dresden 
there are four great museums — the Johanneum, the Albertinum, 
the Zwinger and the Griine Gewolbe — in which opulent art can 
best be appreciated; the porcelain of the Dresden galleries is 
superb, and few branches of art are unrepresented. Gotha is 
remarkable for its ceramics, Brunswick for enamels (in the 
ducal cabinet). Museums of minor importance exist at Hanover, 
Ulm, Wurzburg, Danzig and Liibeck. 

The central museum of France, the Louvre, was founded 
as a public institution during the Revolutionary period. It 
contains the collections of Francois I., Louis XIV., 
and the Napoleons. Many works of art have been 
added to it from royal palaces, and collections formed by dis- 
tinguished connoisseurs (Campana, Sauvageot, La Caze) have 
been incorporated in it. The Greek sculpture, including the 
Venus of Melos and the Nike of Samothrace, is of pre-eminent 
fame. Other departments are well furnished, and from a 
technical point of view the manner in which the officials have 
overcome structural difficulties in adapting the palace to the 
needs of an art museum is most instructive. The Cluny 
Museum, bought by the city in 1842, «and subsequently 
transferred to the state, supplements the medieval collections 
of the Louvre, being a storehouse of select works of art. It 
suffers, however, from being overcrowded, while for purposes 
of study it is badly lighted. At the same time the Maison 
Guny is a well-furnished house, decorated with admirable 
things, and as such has a special didactic value of its own, 
corresponding in this respect with Hertford House and the 
Poldi-Pezzoli Gallery at Milan — collections which are more than 
museums, since they show in the best manner the adaptation of 
artistic taste to domestic life. % The French provincial museums 
are numerous and important. Twenty-two were established 
early in the 19th century, and received 1000 pictures as gifts 
from the state, numbers of which were not returned in 181 5 to 
the countries whence they were taken. The best of these 
museu/ns are at Lyons; at Dijon, where the tombs of Jean sans 
Peur and Philip the Bold are preserved; at Amiens, where the 
capital Musee de Picardie was built in 1850; at Marseilles and at 
Bayeux, where the " Tapestry " is well exhibited. The collec- 
tions of Lille, Bordeaux, Toulouse, and Avignon are also impor- 
tant. The objects shown in these museums are chiefly local 
gleanings, consisting largely of church plate, furniture, together 



France* 



with sculpture, carved wood, and pottery, nearly everything 
being French in origin. In many towns Roman antiquities and 
early Christian relics are preserved {e.g. Autun, Nimes, Aries 
and Luxeuil). Other collections controlled by municipalities 
are kept at Rouen, Douai, Montpellier, Chartres (14th-century 
sculptures), Grenoble, Toulon, Ajaccio, Epinal (Carolingian 
objects), Besanfon, Bourges, Le Mans (with the remarkable 
enamel of Geoffrey of Anjou), Nancy, Aix and in many other 
towns. As a rule, the public is admitted free of charge, special 
courtesy being shown to foreigners. In many cases the collections 
arc ill cared for and uncatalogued, and little money is provided 
for acquisitions in the civic museums; indeed, in this respect the 
great national institutions contrast unfavourably with British 
establishments, to which purchase grants are regularly made. 

The national, civic and papal museums of Italy are so numerous 
that a few only can be mentioned. The best arranged and best 
classified collection is the Museo Nazionale at Naples, 
containing many thousand examples of Roman ay * 

art, chiefly obtained from the immediate neighbourhood. For 
historical importance it ranks as primus inter pares with the 
collections of Rome and the Vatican. It is, however, the only 
great Italian museum where scientific treatment is consistently 
adopted. Other museums of purely classical art are found at 
Syracuse, Cagliari and Palermo. Etruscan art is best displayed 
at Arezzo, Perugia (in the university), Cortona, Florence (Museo 
Archeologico), Volterra and the Vatican. The Florentine 
museums'are of great importance, consisting of the archaeological 
museum of antique bronzes, Egyptian art, and a great number of 
tapestries. The Museo Nazionale, boused in the Bargello (a.d. 
1260), is the central depository of Tuscan art. Numerous 
examples of Delia Robbia ware have been gathered together, 
and are fixed to the walls in a manner and position which reduce 
their value to a minimum. The plastic arts of Tuscany are 
represented by Donatello, Verrocchio, Ghiberti, and Cellini, 
while the Carrand collection of ivories, pictures, and varied 
medieval specimens is of much interest. This museum, like so 
many others, is becoming seriously overcrowded, to the lasting 
detriment of churches, market-places, and streets, whence these 
works of art are being ruthlessly removed. The public is admitted 
free one day a week, and the receipts are devoted to art and 
antiquarian purposes (" tasse . . . destinate . . . alia conver- 
sazione dei monumenti, all' ampliamento 'degli scavi, ed' all* 
incremento dei instituti . . . nella citta." — Law of 1875, §5). 
The museums of Rome are numerous, the Vatican alone contain- 
ing at least six — Museo Clementino, of classical art, with the 
Laocoon, the Apollo Belvedere, and other masterpieces; the 
Chiaramonti, also of classical sculpture; the Gallery of Inscrip- 
tions; the Egyptian, the Etruscan and the Christian museums. 
The last is an extensive collection corresponding with another 
papal museum in the Lateran Palace, also known as the Christian 
Museum (founded 1843), an ^ remarkable for its sarcophagi and 
relics from the catacombs. The Lateran has also a second 
museum known as the Museo Profano. "Museums belonging 
to the state are equally remarkable. The Kircher Museum deals 
with prehistoric art, and contains the " Preneste Hoard." The 
Museo Nazionale (by the Baths of Diocletian), the Museo Capi- 
tolino, and the Palazzo dei Conservatori contain innumerable 
specimens of the finest classical art, vases, bronzes, mosaics, 
and statuary, Greek as well as Roman. Among provincial 
museums there are few which do not possess at least one or two 
objects of signal merit. Thus Brescia, besides a medieval 
collection, has a famous bronze Victory. Pesaro, Urbino, and 
the Museo Correr at Venice have admirable examples of majolica; 
Milan, Pisa and Genoa have general archaeology combined with 
a good proportion of mediocrity. The civic museum of Bologna 
is comprehensive and well arranged, having Egyptian, classical, 
and Etruscan collections, besides many things dating from the 
" Bella Epoca " of Italian art. At Ravenna alone can the 
Byzantine art of Italy be properly understood, and it is most 
deplorable that the superb collections in its fine galleries should 
remain uncatalogued and neglected. Turin, Siena, Padua, and 
other towns have civic museums.

The Ryks Museum at Amsterdam, containing the national 
collections of Holland, is a modern building in which a series 
Belgium of historical rooms are furnished to show at a glance 
and the artistic progress of the Dutch at any given period. 

Holland. ^ine rooms are also devoted to the chronological 
display of ecclesiastical art. Besides the famous paintings, this 
museum (the sole drawback of which is the number of rooms 
which have no top light) contains a library, many engravings, a 
comprehensive exhibit of armour, costume, metal-work, and a 
department of maritime craftsmanship. Arnhem and Haarlem 
have municipal collections. At Leiden the university maintains 
a scholarly collection of antiquities. The Hague and Rotterdam 
have also museums, but everything in Holland is subordinated 
to the development of the great central depository at Amsterdam, 
to which examples are sent from all parts of the country. In 
Belgium the chief museum, that of ancient industrial art, is at 
Brussels. It contains many pieces of medieval church furniture 
and decoration, but in this respect differs only in size from the 
civic museums of Ghent and Luxemburg and the Archbishop's 
Museum at Utrecht. In Brussels, however, there is a good show 
of Frankish and Carolingian objects. The city of Antwerp 
maintains the Musee Plantin, a printing establishment which has 
survived almost intact, and presents one of the most charming 
and instructive museums in the world. As a whole, the 
museums of Belgium are disappointing, though, per contra, the 
churches are of enhanced interest, not having been pillaged for 
the benefit of museums. ■ 

New museums are being founded in Russia every year. 
KharkofI and Odessa (the university) have already large collec- 
tions, and in the most remote parts of Siberia it is 
curious to find carefully chosen collections. Krasno- 
yarsk has 12,000 specimens, a storehouse of Buriat art. Irkutsk 
the capital, Tobolsk, Tomsk (university), Khabarovsk, and 
Yakutsk have now museums. In these Russian art naturally 
predominates. It is only at Moscow and St Petersburg that 
Western art is found. The Hermitage Palace in the latter city 
contains a selection of medieval objects of fabulous value, there 
being no less than forty early ivories. But from a national point 
of view these, collections are insignificant when compared with 
the gold and silver objects illustrating the primitive arts and 
ornament of Scythia, Crimea and Caucasia, the high standard 
attained proving an advanced stage of manual skill. At Moscow 
(historical museum) the stone and metal relics are scarcely less 
interesting. There is also a museum of industrial art-, the speci- 
mens of which are not of unusual value, but being analogous to 
the Kunstgewerbc movement in Germany, it exercises a whole- 
some influence upon the designers who study in its schools. 

American museums are not committed to traditional systems, 
and scientific treatment is allowed its fullest scope. They exist 
in great numbers, and though in some cases their 
exhibits are chiefly ethnographic, a far wider range 
of art objects is rapidly being secured. The National Museum 
at Washington, a branch of the Smithsonian Institution (q.v.), 
while notable for its American historical and ethnological 
exhibits, has the National Gallery of Art. The Metropolitan 
Museum of Art (held by trustees for the benefit of the city 
of New York) has in the Cesnola collection the most complete 
series of Cypriot art objects. It has also departments of coins, 
Greek sculpture and general examples of European and American 
art. The Museum of Fine Arts at Boston is very comprehensive, 
and has a remarkable collection of ceramics, together with good 
reproductions of antique art. There are museums at St 
Louis, Chicago, Pittsburg, Brooklyn, Cincinnati, Buffalo and 
Washington, as well as Montreal in Canada; and the universities 
of Harvard, Chicago, Pennsylvania and Yale have important 
collections. 

* The Swiss National Museum is situated at Zurich, and though 
of medium size (50 rooms), it is a model of arrangement and 
organization. Besides the special feature of rooms 
Countries, illustrating the historical progress of art, its collection 
of stained glass is important. Basel also (historical 
museum) is but little inferior in contents or system to the Zurich

establishment. Geneva has three collections. Lausanne holds 
the museum of the canton, and Bern has a municipal collection. 
All these institutions are well supported financially, and are 
much appreciated by the Swiss public. The art museums of 
Stockholm, Christiania and Copenhagen rank high for their 
intrinsic excellence, but still more for their scientific and didactic 
value. Stockholm has three museums: that of the Royal 
Palace, a collection of costume and armour; the Northern 
Museum, a large collection of domestic art; the National 
Museum, containing the prehistoric collections, gold ornaments, 
&c, classified in a brilliant manner. The National Museum 
of Denmark at Copenhagen is in this respect even more famous, 
being probably the second national collection in the world. The 
arrangement of this collection leaves little to be desired, and it 
is to be regretted that some British collections, in themselves of 
immense value, cannot be shown, as at Copenhagen, in a manner 
which would display their great merits to the fullest degree. 
There is also at Copenhagen a remarkable collection of antique 
busts (Gamle Glyptotek), and the Thorwaldsen Museum con- 
nected with the sculptor of that name. Norse antiquities are 
at Christiania (the university) and Bergen. Athens has three 
museums, all devoted to Greek art: that of the Acropolis, that 
of the Archaeological Society (vases and terra-cotta) and the 
National Museum of Antiquities. The state owns all discoveries 
and these are accumulated at the capital, so that local museums 
scarcely exist. The collections, which rapidly increase, are of 
great importance, though as yet they cannot vie with the 
aggregate in other European countries. The Museum of 
Egyptian Antiquities (Cairo), founded by Mariette Bey at Bulak, 
afterwards removed to theGiza palace and developed by Maspero, 
is housed in a large building erected in 1902, well classified, and 
liberally supported with money and fresh acquisitions. Minor 
museums exist at Carthage and Tunis. At Constantinople the 
Turkish Museum contains some good classical sculpture and a 
great deal of rubbish. The Museo del Prado and the Archaeo- 
logical Museum at Madrid are the chief Spanish collections, 
containing numerous classical objects and many specimens of 
Moorish and early Spanish art. In Spain museums are badly 
kept, and their contents are of indifferent value. The museums 
of the chief provinces are situated at Barcelona, Valencia, 
Granada and Seville. Cadiz and Cordova have also sadly 
neglected civic collections. The National Museum of Portugal at 
Lisbon requires no special comment. The progress of Japan 
is noticeable in its museums as in its industrial enterprise. The 
National Museum(Weno Park, Tokyo) is large and well arranged 
in a new building of Western architecture. Kioto and Nara 
have excellent museums, exclusively of Oriental art, and two or 
three other towns have smaller establishments, including com- 
mercial museums. There are several museums in India, the 
chief one being at Calcutta, devoted to Indian antiquities.

MUSEUMS OF SCIENCE. The ideal museum should cover 
the whole field of human knowledge. It. should teach the 
truths of all the sciences, including anthropology, the science 
which deals with man and all his works in every age. All the 



MUSEUMS OF SCIENCE 



65 



sciences and all the arts are correlated. The wide separation 
of collections illustrative of the arts (see Museums of Art above) 
from those illustrative of the sciences, and their treatment as 
if belonging to a wholly different sphere, is arbitrary. Such 
separation, which is to-day the rule rather than the exception, 
is due to the circumstances of the origin of many collections, 
or in other cases to the limitations imposed by poverty or lack 
of space. Many of the national museums of continental Europe 
had their beginnings in collections privately acquired by 
monarchs, who, at a time when the modern sciences were in their 
infancy, entertained themselves by assembling objects which 
appealed to their love of the beautiful and the curious. The 
pictures, marbles, bronzes and bric-a-brac of the palace became 
the nucleus of the museum of to-day, and in some notable cases 
the palace itself was converted into a museum. In a few instances 
these museums, in which works of art had the first place, have 
been enriched and supplemented by collections illustrative of 
the advancing sciences of a later date, but in a majority of cases 
these collections have remained what they were at the outset, 
mere exponents of human handicraft in one or the other, or all 
of its various departments. Some recent great foundations 
have copied the more or less defective models of the past, and 
museums devoted exclusively to the illustration of one or the 
other narrow segment of knowledge will no doubt continue to 
be multiplied, and in spite of their limited range, will do much 
good. A notable illustration of the influence of lack of space 
in bringing about a separation of anthropological collections 
from collections illustrative of other sciences is afforded by the 
national collection in London. For many years the collections 
of the British Museum, literary, artistic and scientific, were 
assembled in ideal relationship in Bloomsbury, but at last the 
accumulation of treasure became so vast and the difficulties of 
administration were so pressing that a separation was decided 
upon, and the natural history collections were finally removed 
to the separate museum in Cromwell Road, South Kensington. 
But the student of museums can never fail to regret that the 
necessities of space and financial considerations compelled this 
separation, which in a measure destroyed the ideal relationship 
which had for so many years obtained. 

The ancient world knew nothing of museums in the modern 
sense of the term. There were collections of paintings and 
statuary in the temples and palaces of Greece and Rome; the 
homes of the wealthy were everywhere adorned by works of art ; 
curious objects of natural history were often brought from afar, 
as the skins of the female gorillas, which Hanno after his voyage 
on the west coast of Africa hung up in the temple of Astarte at 
Carthage; Alexander the Great granted to his illustrious teacher, 
Aristotle, a large sum of money for use in his scientific researches, 
sent him natural history collections from conquered lands, and 
put at his service thousands of men to collect specimens, upon 
which he based his work on natural history; the museum of 
Alexandria, which included within its keeping the Alexandrian 
library, was a great university composed of a number of associated 
colleges; but there was nowhere in all the ancient world an 
institution which exactly corresponded in its scope and purpose 
to the modern museum. The term " museum," after the 
burning of the great institution of Alexandria, appears to have 
fallen into disuse from the 4th to the 17th century, and the idea 
which the word represented slipped from the minds of men. 

The revival of learning in the 15th century was accompanied 
by an awakening of interest in classical antiquity, and many 
persons laboured eagerly upon the collection of memorials of 
the past. Statuary, inscriptions, gems, coins, medals and manu- 
scripts were assembled by the wealthy and the learned. The 
leaders in this movement were presently followed by others who 
devoted themselves to the search for minerals, plants and curious 
animals. Among the more famous early collectors of objects 
of natural history may be mentioned GeorgAgricola(i49o-i555), 
who has been styled " the father of mineralogy." By his 
labours the elector Augustus of Saxony was induced to establish 
the Kunsl und Naturalien Kammer, which has since expanded 
into the various museums at Dresden. One of his contempo- 
xrx. 3 



raries was Conrad Gesner of Zurich (1516-1565), " the German 
Pliny," whose writings are still resorted to by the curious. 
Others whose names are familiar were Pierre Belon (1517-1564), 
professor at the College de France; Andrea Cesalpini (1510-1603), 
whose herbarium is still preserved at Florence; Ulissi Aldrovandi 
(1522-1605), remnants of whose collections still exist at Bologna; 
Ole Worm (1588-1654), a Danish physician, after whom the so- 
called " Wormian bones " of the skull are named, and who was 
one of the first to cultivate what is now known as the science 
of prehistoric archaeology. At a later date the collection of 
Albert Seba (1665-1736) of Amsterdam became famous, and 
was purchased by Peter the Great in 1716, and removed to 
St Petersburg. In Great Britain among early collectors were 
the two Tradescants; Sir John Woodward (1665-1728), a portion 
of whose collections, bequeathed by him to Cambridge University 
is still preserved there in the Woodwardian or Geological Museum ; 
Sir James Balfour (1600-1657), and Sir Andrew Balfour (1630- 
1694), whose work was continued in part by Sir Robert Sibbald 
( 1 64 1-1 722). The first person to elaborate and present to modern 
minds the thought of an institution which should assemble 
within its walls the things which, men wish to see and study was 
Bacon, who in his New Atlantis (1627) broadly sketched the 
outline of a great national museum of science and art. 

The first surviving scientific museum established upon a 
substantial basis was the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford, 
founded by Elias Ashmole. The original collection had been 
made by the Tradescants, father and son, gardeners who were 
in the employment of the duke of Buckingham and later of King 
Charles I. and his queen; it consisted of " twelve cartloads of 
curiosities," principally from Virginia and Algiers, which the 
younger Tradescant bequeathed to Ashmole, and which, after 
much litigation with Tradescant's widow, he gave to Oxford 
upon condition that a suitable building should be provided. 
This was done in 1682 after plans by Sir Christopher Wren.. 
Ashmole in his diary makes record, on the 17th of February 
1683, that " the last load of my rareties was sent to the barge, 
and this afternoon I relapsed into the gout." 

The establishment of the German academy of Naturae 
Curiosi in 1652, of the Royal Society of London in 1660, and of 
the Academie des Sciences of Paris in 1666, imparted a powerful 
impulse to scientific investigation, which was reflected not only 
in the labours of a multitude of persons who undertook the 
formation of private scientific collections, but in the initiation 
by crowned heads of movements looking toward the formation 
of national collections, many of which, having their beginnings 
in the latter half .of the 17th century and the early years of the 
1 8th century, survive to the present day. 

The most famous of all English collectors in his time was 
Sir Hans Sloane (1660-1753), whose vast collection, acquired at 
a great outlay of money, arid including the collections of Petiver, 
Courten, Merret, Plukenet, and Buddie — all of which he had 
purchased — was by his will bequeathed to the British nation on 
condition that parliament should pay to his heirs the sum of 
£20,000, a sum far less tftanthat which he had expended upon it, 
and representing, it is sild, only the value of the coins which it 
contained. Sloane was a man who might justly have said of 
himself " humani nihil a me alienum puto "; and his collection 
attested the catholicity of his tastes and the breadth of his 
scientific appetencies. The bequest of Sloane was accepted 
upon the terms of his will, and, together with the library of 
George II., which had likewise been bequeathed to the nation, 
was thrown open to the public at Bloomsbury in 1750 as the 
British Museum. As showing the great advances which have 
occurred in the administration of museums since that day, the 
following extract taken from A Guide- Book to the General 
Contents of the British Museum, published in 1761, is interest- 
ing: ". . . fifteen persons are allowed to view it in one Company, 
the Time allotted is two Hours; and when any Number not 
exceeding fifteen are inclined to see it, they must send a List of 
their Christian and Sirnames, Additions, and Places of Abode, to 
the Porter's Lodge, in order to their being entered in the Book; 
in a few Days the respective Tickets will be made out, specifying 



66 



MUSEUMS OF SCIENCE 



the Day and Hour in which they are to come, which, on being 
sent for, are delivered. If by any Accident some of the Parties 
are prevented from coming, it is proper they send their 
Ticket back to the Lodge, as nobody can be admitted with it 
but themselves. It is to be remarked that the fewer Names there 
are in a List, the sooner they are likely to be admitted to see it." 

The establishment of the British Museum was coincident in 
time with the development of the systematic study of nature, 
of which Linnaeus was at that time the most distinguished 
exponent. The modern sciences, the wonderful triumphs of 
which have revolutionized the world, were just emerging from 
their infancy. Museums were speedily found to furnish the 
best agency for preserving the records of advancing knowledge, 
so far as these consisted of the materials upon which the investi- 
gator had laboured. In a short time it became customary for 
the student, either during his lifetime or at his death, to entrust 
to the permanent custody of museums the collections upon 
which he had based his studies and observations. Museums were 
thenceforth rapidly multiplied, and came to be universally 
regarded as proper repositories for scientific collections of all 
kinds. But the use of museums as repositories of the collec- 
tions of the learned came presently to be associated with their 
use as seats of original investigation and research. Collections 
of new and rare objects which had not yet received attentive 
study came into their possession. Voyages of exploration 
into unknown lands, undertaken at public or private expense, 
added continually to their treasures. The comparison of newer 
collections with older collections which had been already made 
the subject of study, was undertaken. New truths were thus 
ascertained. A body of students was attracted to the museums, 
who in a few years by their investigations began not only to add 
to the sum of human knowledge, but by their publications to 
shed lustre upon the institutions with which they were connected. 
The spirit of inquiry was wisely fostered by private and public 
munificence, and museums as centres for the diffusion of scientific 
truth came to hold a well-recognized position. Later still, 
about the middle of the 19th century, when the importance of 
popular education and the necessity of popularizing knowledge 
came to be more thoroughly recognized than it had heretofore 
been, museums were found to be peculiarly adapted in certain 
respects for the promotion of the culture of the masses. They 
became under the new impulse not merely repositories of scientific 
records and seats of original research, but powerful educational 
agencies, in which by object lessons the most important truths of 
science were capable of being pleasantly imparted to multitudes. 
The old narrow restrictions were thrown down. Their doors 
were freely opened to the people, and at the beginning of the 
20th century the movement for the establishment of museums 
assumed a magnitude scarcely, if at all, less than the movement 
on behalf of the diffusion of popular knowledge through public 
libraries. While great national museums have been founded and 
all the large municipalities of the world through private or civic 
gifts have established museums within their limits, a multitude 
of lesser towns, and even in some cases villages, have established 
museums, and museums as adjuncts of universities, colleges and 
high schools have come to be recognized as almost indispensable. 
The movement has assumed its greatest proportions in Great 
Britain and her colonies, Germany, and the United States of 
America, although in many other lands it has already advanced 
far. 

There are now in existence in the world, exclusive of museums 
of art, not less than 2000 scientific museums which possess in 
themselves elements of permanence, some of which are splendidly 
supported by public munificence, and a number of which have 
been richly endowed by private benefactions. 

Great Britain and Ireland. — The greatest museum in London 
is the British Museum. The natural history department at 
South Kensington, with its wealth of types deposited there, 
constitutes the most important collection of the kind in the 
world. The Museum of Practical Geology in Jermyn Street 
contains a beautiful and well-arranged collection of minerals 
and a very complete series of specimens illustrative of the 



petrography and the invertebrate paleontology of the British 
Islands. The botanical collections at Kew are classic, and are 
as rich in types as are the zoological collections of the British 
Museum. The Hunterian Museum of the Royal College of 
Surgeons contains a notable assemblage of specimens illustrating 
anatomy, both human and comparative, as well as pathology. 
In London also a number of private owners possess large collec- 
tions of natural history specimens, principally ornithological, 
entomological and conchological, in some instances destined to 
find a final resting place in the national collection. One of the 
most important of these great collections is that formed by F. 
Ducane Godman, whose work on the fauna of middle America, 
entitled Biologia centrali-americana, is an enduring monument 
to his learning and generosity. The Hon. Walter Rothschild 
has accumulated at Tring one of the largest and most important 
natural history collections which has ever been assembled by a 
single individual. It is particularly rich in rare species which 
are either already extinct or verging upon extinction, and the 
ornithological and entomological collections are vast in extent 
and rich in types. Lord Walsingham has at his country seat, 
Merton Hall, near Thetford, the largest and most perfect 
collection of the microlepidoptera of the world which is in 
existence. 

The Ashmolean Museum and the University Museum at Oxford, 
and the Woodwardian Museum and the University Museum at 
Cambridge, are remarkable collections. The Free Public Museum 
at Liverpool is in some respects one of the finest and most 
successfuDy arranged museums in Great Britain. It contains 
a great wealth of important scientific material, and is rich in 
types, particularly of birds. The Manchester Museum of Owens 
College and the museum in Sheffield have in recent years 
accomplished much for the cause of science and popular educa- 
tion. The Bristol Museum has latterly achieved considerable 
growth and has become a centre of much enlightened activity. 
The Royal Scottish Museum, the herbarium of the Royal 
Botanical Garden, and the collections of the Challenger Expe- 
dition Office in Edinburgh, are worthy of particular mention. 
The museum of the university of Glasgow and the Glasgow 
Museum contain valuable collections. The museum of St 
Andrews University is very rich in. material illustrating marine 
zoology, and so also are the collections of University College at 
Dundee. The Science and Art Museum of Dublin and the 
Public Museum of Belfast, in addition to the works of art which 
they contain, possess scientific collections of importance. 

There are also in Great Britain and Ireland some two hundred 
smaller museums, in which there are collections which cannot be 
overlooked by specialists, more particularly by those interested 
in geology, paleontology and archaeology. 

India. — The Indian Museum, the Geological Museum of the 
Geological Survey of India, and the herbarium of the Royal Botanic 
Garden in Calcutta, are richly endowed with collections illustrating 
the natural history of Hindostan and adjacent countries. The 
finest collection of the vertebrate fossils of the Siwalik Hills is that 
found in the Indian Museum. The Victoria and Albert Museum in 
Bombay and the Government Museum in Madras are institutions 
of importance. 

Australia. — The Queensland Museum, and the museum of the 
Geological Survey of Queensland located in Brisbane, and the 
National Museum at Melbourne, Victoria, represent important 
beginnings. Sydney, the capital of New South VVales, is the centre 
of considerable scientific activity. The museums connected with 
the university of Sydney, the museum of the Geological Survey of 
New South Wales, and the Australian Museum, all possess valuable 
collections. The museum at Adelaide is noteworthy. 

New Zealand. — Good collections are found in the Otago Museum, 
Dunedin, the Canterbury Museum at Christ Church, the Auckland 
Museum at Auckland, and the Colonial Museum at Wellington. 

South Africa. — The South African Museum at Capetown is a 
flourishing and important institution, which has done excellent 
work in the field of South African zoology. A museum has been 
established at Durban, Natal, which gives evidence of vitality. 

Egypt. — Archaeological studies overshadow all others in the land 
of the Nile, and the splendid collections of the great museum of 
antiquities at Cairo find nothing to parallel them in the domain of 
the purely natural sciences. A geological museum was, however, 
established in the autumn of 1903, and in view of recent remarkable 
paleontological discoveries in Egypt possesses brilliant opportunities

Canada. — In connexion with the Universiti Laval in Quebec, 
the McGill University in Montreal, and the university of Toronto 
in Ontario, beginnings of significance have been made. The Peter 
Redpath Museum of McGilT College contains important collections 
in all branches of natural history, more particularly botany. 
The provincial museum at Victoria, British Columbia, is growing in 
importance. A movement has been begun to establish at Ottawa 
a museum which shall in a sense be for the Dominion a national 
establishment. 

France. — Paris abounds in institutions for the promotion of culture. 
In possession of many of the institutions of learning, such as the Ecole 
Nationale Superieure des Mines, the Institut National Agronomique, 
and the various learned societies, are collections of greater or less 
importance which must be consulted at times by specialists in the 
various sciences. The Museum d'Histoire Naiurelle in the Jardin 
des Plantes is the most comprehensive and important collection of 
its kind in the French metropolis, and while not as rich in types as 
the British Museum, nevertheless contains a vast assemblage of 
classic specimens reflecting the labours of former generations of 
French naturalists. Un-fortunately, much of the best material, 
consisting of the types of species obtained by the naturalists of 
French voyages of exploration, have been too long exposed to the 
intense light which fills the great building and have become bleached 
and faded to a great degree. The zeal to popularize knowledge by 
the display of specimens has conflicted with the purpose to preserve 
the records of science, a fact which French naturalists themselves 
universally admit. As in England, so also in France, there are a 
number of virtuosi, who have amassed fine private collections. 
One of the very largest and finest of all the entomological collections 
of the world is that at Rennes, belonging to the brothers Oberthur, 
upon which they have expended princely sums. The Museum-des 
Sciences Naturelles of Lyons is in some respects an important 
institution. 

Belgium. — Brussels has been called " a city of museums." The 
MusSe du Congo and the Musee Royal d'Histoire Naiurelle du Belgique 
are the two most important institutions from the standpoint of the 
naturalist. The former is rich in ethnographic and zoological material 
brought from the Congo Free State, and the latter contains very 
important paleontological collections. 

Holland. — The zoological museum of the Koninklijk Zoologisch 
Genootschap, affiliated with the university at Amsterdam, is well 
known. The royal museums connected with the university of 
Leiden are centres of much scientific activity. 

Denmark. — The National Museum at Copenhagen is particularly 
rich in Scandinavian and Danish antiquities. 

Sweden. — In Stockholm, the capital, the Nordiska Museet is 
devoted to Scandinavian ethnology, and the Naturhistoriska Riks- 
Museum is rich in paleontological, botanical and archaeological 
collections. Great scientific treasures are also contained in the 
museums connected with the university of JJpsala. 

Norway. — Classic collections especially interesting to the student 
of marine zoology are contained in the university of Christiania. 

Germany.— Germany is rich in museums, some of which are of 
very great importance. The Museum fur Naturkunde , the ethno- 
graphical museum, the anthropological museum, the mineralogical 
museum and the agricultural museum in Berlin are noble institutions, 
the first mentioned being particularly rich in classical collections. 
Hamburg boasts an excellent natural history museum and ethno- 
raphical museum, the Museum Godeffroyand theMuseum Umlauff. 
"here are a number of important private collections in Hamburg. 
The municipal museum in Bremen is important from the standpoint 
of the naturalist and ethnologist. The Roemer Museum at Hildes- 
heim is one of the best provincial museums in Germany. Dresden 
even more justly than Brussels may be called "a city of museums," 
and the mineralogical, archaeological, zoological and anthropological 
museums are exceedingly important from the standpoint of the 
naturalist. Here also in private hands is the greatest collection 
of palaearctic lepidoptera in Europe, belonging to the heirs of Dr 
Otto Staudinger. The ethnographical museum at Leipzig is rich 
in collections brought together from South and Central America. 
The natural history museum, the anatomical museum and the ethno- 
graphical museum in Munich are important institutions, the first 
mentioned being particularly rich in paleontological treasures. 
The natural history museum of Stuttgart is likewise noted for 
its important paleontological collections. The Senckenbernsche 
Naturforsckende Gesellschaft museum at Frankfort-on-the-Main 
contains a very important collection of ethnographical, zoological 
and botanical material. The museum of the university at Bonn, 
and more i particularly the anatomical museum, are noteworthy. 
In connexion with almost all the German universities and in almost 
all the larger towns and cities are to be found museums, in many of 
which there are important assemblages illustrating not only the 
natural history of the immediate neighbourhood, but in a multitude 
of cases containing important material collected in foreign lands. 
One of the most interesting of the smaller museums lately established 
is that at Lubeck, a model in its way for a provincial museum. 

Austro-Hungary. — The Imperial Natural HistoryMuseum inVienna 
is one of the noblest institutions of its kind in Europe, and possesses 
one of the finest mineralogical collections in the world. It is rich 
also in botanical and conchological collections. There are important 



fi 



ethnographical and anthropological collections at Budapest. The 
natural history collections of the Bohemian national museum at 
Prague are well arranged, though not remarkably extensive. 

Russia. — The Rumiantsof Museum in Moscow possesses splendid 
buildings, with a library of over 700,000 volumes in addition to 
splendid artistic treasures, and is rich in natural history specimens. 
It is one of the most magnificent foundations of its kind in Europe. 
There are a number of magnificent museums in St Petersburg which 
contain stores of important material. Foremost among these is 
the museum of the Imperial Academy of Sciences, rich in collec- 
tions illustrating the zoology, paleontology and ethnology, not only 
of the Russian Empire, but also of foreign lands. There are a number 
of provincial museums in the larger cities of Russia which are growing 
in importance. 

Italy. — Italy is rich in museums of art, but natural history 
collections are not as strongly represented as in other lands. Con- 
nected with the various universities are collections which possess 
more or less importance from the standpoint of the specialist. 
The Museo Civico di Storia Naturale at Genoa, and the collections 
preserved at the marine biological station at Naples, have most 
interest for the zoologist. 

Spain. — There are no natural history collections of first importance 
in Spain, though at all the universities there are minor collections, 
which are in some instances creditably cared for and arranged. 

Portugal. — The natural history museum at Lisbon contains 
important ornithological treasures. 

Eastern Asia. — The awakening of the empire of Japan has resulted 
among other things in the cultivation of the modern sciences, and 
there are a number of scientific students, mostly trained in European 
and American universities, who are doing excellent work in the 
biological and allied sciences. Very creditable beginnings have been 
made in connexion with the Imperial University at Toldo for the 
establishment of a museum of natural history. At Shanghai there 
is a collection, gathered by the Chinese branch of the Royal Asiatic 
Society, which .is in a decadent state, but contains much good 
material. Otherwise as yet the movement to establish museums has 
not laid strong hold upon the inhabitants of eastern Asia. At 
Batavia in Java, and at Manila in the Philippine Islands, there are 
found the nuclei of important collections. 

United States. — The movement to establish museums in the 
United States is comparatively recent. One of the very earliest 
collections (1802), which, however, was soon dispersed, was 
made by Charles Willson Peale (q.v.). The Academy of Natural 
Sciences in Philadelphia, established in 18 12, is the oldest society 
for the promotion of the natural sciences in the United States. 
It possesses a very important library and some most excellent 
collections, and is rich in ornithological, conchological and 
botanical types. The city of Philadelphia also points with pride 
to the free museum of archaeology connected with the university 
of Pennsylvania, and to the Philadelphia museums, the latter 
museums of commerce, but which incidentally do much to pro- 
mote scientific knowledge, especially in the domain of ethnology, 
botany and mineralogy. The Wistar Institute of Anatomy 
is well endowed and organized." The zoological museum at 
Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts, is associated 
with the names of Louis and Alexander Agassiz, the former of 
whom by his learning and activity as a collector, and the latter 
by his munificent gifts, as well as by his important researches, 
not only created the institution, but made it a potent agency 
for the advancement of science. The Peabody Museum of 
American Archaeology and Ethnology, likewise connected with 
Harvard University, is one of the greatest institutions of its 
kind in the New World. The Essex Institute at Salem, Massa- 
chusetts, is noteworthy. The Butterfield Museum, Dartmouth 
College, Hanover, New Hampshire, and the Fairbanks Museum 
of Natural Science (1891) at St Johnsbury, Vermont, are im- 
portant modern institutions. In the museum of Amherst 
College are preserved the types of the birds described by J. J. 
Audubon, the shells described by C. B. Adams, the mineralogical 
collections of Charles Upham Shepard, and the paleontological 
collections of President Hitchcock. In Springfield (1898) 
and Worcester, Massachusetts, there are excellent museums. 
The Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale University, 
New Haven, Connecticut, contains much of the paleontological 
material described by Professor O. C. Marsh. The New 
York State Museum at Albany is important from a geological 
and paleontological standpoint. The American Museum of 
Natural History in New York City, founded in 1869, provision 
for the growth and enlargement of which upon a scale of the

utmost magnificence has heen made, is liberally .supported 
both by public and private munificence. The ethnographical, 
paleontological and archaeological material gathered within 
its walls is immense in extent and superhly displayed. The 
museum of the New York botanical garden in Bronx Park is 
a worthy rival to the museums at Kew. The Brooklyn Institute 
of Arts and Sciences combines with collections illustrative of 
the arts excellent collections of natural history, many of which 
are classic. 

The United States National Museum at Washington, under 
the control of the Smithsonian Institution, of which it is a depart- 
ment, has been made the repository for many years past of the 
scientific and artistic collections coming into the possession of 
the government. The growth of the material entrusted to its 
keeping has, more particularly in recent years, been enormous, 
and the collections have wholly outgrown the space provided 
in the original building^ built for it during the incumbency 
of Professor Spencer F. Baird as secretary of the Smithsonian 
Institution. The congress of the United States has in recent 
years made provision for the erection of a new building upon 
the Mall in Washington, to which the natural history collections 
are ultimately to he transferred, the old buildings to be retained 
for the display of collections illustrating the progress of the arts, 
until replaced by a building of better construction for the same 
purpose. The United States National Museum has published 
a great deal, and has become one of the most important agencies 
for the diffusion of scientific knowledge in the country. It is 
liberally supported by the government, and makes use of the 
scientific men connected with all the various departments of 
activity under government control as agents for research. The 
collections of the United States Geological Survey, as well as 
many of the more important scientific collections made by the 
Department of Agriculture, are deposited here. 

As*the result of the great Columbian international exposition, 
which took place in 1893, a movement originated in the city of 
Chicago, where the exposition was held, to form a permanent 
collection of large proportions. The great building in which 
the international exposition of the fine arts was displayed 
was preserved as the temporary heme for the new museum. 
Marshall Field contributed $1,000,000 to the furtherance of 
the enterprise, and in his honour the institution was called 
" The Field Columbian Museum." The growth of this 
institution was very rapid, and Mr. Field, at his death, in 
1906, bequeathed to the museum $8,000,000, half to be 
applied to the erection of a new building, the other half to consti- 
tute an endowment fund, in addition to the revenues derived 
from the endowment already existing. The city of Chicago 
provides liberally for the support of the museum, the name 
of which, in the spring of 1906, was changed to " The Field 
Museum of Natural History." The city of St Louis has taken 
steps, as the result of the international exposition of 1904, to 
emulate the example of Chicago, and the St Louis Public Museum 
was founded under hopeful auspices in 1905. 

Probably the most magnificent foundation for the advance- 
ment of science and art in America which has as yet been created 
is the Carnegie Institute in the city of Pittsburg. The Carnegie 
Institute is a complex of institutions, consisting of a museum 
of art, a museum of science, and a school for the education of 
youth in the elements of technology. Affiliated with the 
museums of art and science, and under the same roof, is the 
Central Free Library of Pittsburg. The buildings erected 
for the accommodation of the institute, at the entrance to 
Schenley Park, cost $8,000,000, and Mr Andrew Carnegie 
provided liberally for the endowment of the museums of art 
and science and the technical school, leaving to the city of 
Pittsburg the maintenance of the general library. The natural 
history collections contained in the museum of science, although 
the institution was only founded in 1896, arc large and 
important, and are particularly rich in mineralogy, geology, 
paleontology, botany and zoology. The entomological collections 
are among the most important in the new world. The concho- 
logical collections are vast, and the paleontological collections 



are among the most important in America. The great Bayet 
collection is the largest and most complete collection represent- 
ing European paleontology in America. The Carnegie Museum 
contains natural history collections aggregating over 1,500,000 
specimens, which cost approximately £125,000, and these are 
growing rapidly. The ethnological collections, particularly 
those illustrating the Indians of the plains, and the archaeological 
collections, representing the cultures more particularly of Costa 
Rica and of Colombia, are large. 

In connexion with almost all the American colleges and 
universities there are museums of more or less importance. 
The Bernice Pauahi Bishop museum at Honolulu is an institution 
established by private munificence, which is doing excellent 
work in the field of Polynesian ethnology and zoology. 

Other American Countries. — The national museum in the city of 
Mexico has in recent years been receiving intelligent encouragement 
and support both from the government and by private individuals, 
and is coming to be an institution of much importance. National 
museums have been established at the capitals of most of the Central 
American and South American states. Some of them represent 
considerable progress, but most of them are in a somewhat languish- 
ing condition. Notable exceptions are the national museum in 
Rio de Janeiro, the Museu Paraense (Museu Goeldi), at Para, the 
Museu Paulista at Sao Paulo, and the national museum in Buenos 
Aires. The latter institution is particularly rich in paleontological 
collections. There is an excellent museum at Valparaiso in Chile, 
which in recent years has been doing good work. (W. J. H.) 

MUSGRAVE, SAMUEL (1732-1780), English classical scholar 
and physician, was born at Washfield, in Devonshire, on the 
29th of September 1732. Educated at Oxford and elected 
to a RadclifTe travelling fellowship, he spent several years 
abroad. In 1766 he settled at Exeter, but not meeting with 
professional success removed to Plymouth. He ruined his 
prospects, however, by the publication of a pamphlet in the 
form of an address to the people of Devonshire, in which he 
accused certain members of the English ministry of having been 
bribed by the French government to conclude the peace of 1763, 
and declared that the Chevalier d'Eon de Beaumont, French 
minister plenipotentiary to England, had in his possession 
documents which would prove the truth of his assertion. De 
Beaumont repudiated all knowledge of any such transaction 
and of Musgrave himself, and the House of Commons in 1770 
decided that the charge was unsubstantiated. Thus discredited, 
Musgrave gained a precarious living in London by his pen until 
his death, in reduced circumstances, on the 5th of July 1780. 
He wrote several medical works, now forgotten; and his edition 
of Euripides (1778) was a considerable advance on that of Joshua 
Barnes.

MUSH, the chief town of a sanjak of the same name of the 
Bitlis vilayet of Asiatic Turkey, and an important military 
station. It is situated at the mouth of a gorge in the mountains 
on the south side of the plain, the surrounding hills being covered 
with vineyards and some oak scrub. There are few good houses; 
the streets are ill-paved and winding, while the place and its 
surroundings are extremely dirty. The castle, of which there 
are some remains, is said to have been built by Mushig, an 
Armenian king of the province Daron, who founded the town. 
A khan, with two stone lions (Arab or Seljuk) in bas-relief, 
deserves notice, but the bazaar is poor, although pretty 
embroidered caps are produced. Good roads lead to Erzerum 
and Bitlis. There are 1400 inhabitants, consisting of Kurds 
and Armenians, about equally divided. The climate Is healthy 
but cold in winter, with a heavy snow fall. Mush is the seat 
of the Gregorian and Roman Catholic Armenian bishops and 
some American mission schools. Some miles to the west at 
the edge of the plain is the celebrated monastery of Surp 
Garabed or St John the Baptist, an important place of Armenian 
pilgrimage. 

Mush plain, 35 m. long by 12 broad, is very fertile, growing 
wheat and tobacco, and is dotted with many thriving Armenian 
villages. The Murad or eastern Euphrates traverses the western 
end of the plain and disappears into a narrow mountain gorge 
there. Vineyards are numerous and a fair wine is produced.

Wood is scarce and the usual fuel is lezek or dried cow-dung. 
There are several sulphur springs, and earthquakes are frequent

Xenophon first made acquaintance with Armenian houses, 
which have little changed since his day. 

MUSHROOM. 1 There are few more useful, more easily 
recognized, or more delicious members of the vegetable kingdom 
than the common mushroom, known botanically as Agaricus 
campestris (or Psalliota campestris). It grows in short grass 
in the temperate regions of all parts of the world. Many 
edible fungi depend upon minute and often obscure botanical 
characters for their determination, and may readily be con- 
founded with worthless or poisonous species; but that is not the 
case with the common mushroom, for, although several other 
species of Agaricus somewhat closely approach it in form and 
colour, yet the true mushroom, if sound and freshly gathered, may 
be distinguished from all other fungi with great ease. It almost 
invariably grows in rich, open, breezy pastures, in places where 
the grass is kept short by the grazing of horses^ herds and flocks. 
Although this plant is popularly termed the " meadow mush- 
room," it never as a rule grows in meadows. It never grows in 
wet boggy places, never in woods, or on or about stumps of trees. 
An exceptional specimen or an uncommon variety may sometimes 
be seen in the above-mentioned abnormal places, but the best, 
the true, and common variety of the table is the produce of short, 
upland, wind-swept pastures. A true mushroom is never large in 
size; its cap very seldom exceeds 4, at most 5 in. in diameter. 
The large examples measuring from 6 to 9 or more in. across 
the cap belong to Agaricus arvensis, called from its large size and 
coarse texture the horse mushroom, which grows in meadows 
and damp shady places, and though generally wholesome is 
coarse and sometimes indigestible. The mushroom usually 
grown in gardens or hot-beds, in cellars, sheds, &c, is a distinct 
variety known as Agaricus hortensis. On being cut or broken the 
flesh of a true mushroom remains white or nearly so, the flesh 
of the coarser horse mushroom changes to buff or sometimes to 
dark brown. To summarize the characters of a true mushroom 
— it grows only in pastures; it is of small size, dry, and with 
unchangeable flesh; the cap has a frill; the gills are free from the 
stem, the spores brown-black or deep purple-black in colour, 
and the stem solid or slightly pithy. When all these char- 
acters are taken together no other mushroom-like fungus — 
and nearly a thousand species grow in Britain — can be con- 
founded with it. 

The parts of a mushroom consist chiefly of stem and cap; the stem 
has a clothy ring round its middle, and the cap is furnished under- 
neath with numerous radiating coloured gills. Fig. 1(1) represents 
a section through an infant mushroom, (2) a mature example, 
and (3) a longitudinal section through a fully developed mushroom. 
The cap d, e is fleshy, firm and white within, never thin and watery; 
externally it is pale brown, dry, often slightly silky or floccose, 
never viscid. The cuticle of a mushroom readily peels away from 
the flesh beneath, as shown at F. The cap has a narrow dependent 
marginor frill, as shown at G, and in section at h; this dependent 
frill originates in the rupture of a delicate continuous wrapper, 
which in the infancy of the mushroom entirely wraps the young 
plant; it is shown in its continuous state at J, and at the moment 
of rupture at K. The gills underneath the cap L, M, N are at first 
white, then rose-coloured, at length brown-black. A point of great 
importance is to be noted in the attachment of the gills near the stem 
at o, p; the gills in the true mushroom are (as shown) usually more 
or less free from the stem, they never grow boldly against it or run 
down it; they may sometimes just touch the spot where the stem 
joins the bottom of the cap, but never more; there is usually a slight 
channel, as at p, all round the top of the stem. When a mushroom 
is perfectly ripe and the gills are brown-black in colour, they throw 
down a^ thick dusty deposit of fine brown-black or purple-black 
spores; it is essential to note the colour. The spores on germination 
make a white felted mat, more or less dense, of mycelium; this, 
when compacted with dry, half-decomposed dunp:, is the mushroom 
spawn of gardeners. The stem is firm, slightly pithy up the middle, 
but never hollow; it bears a floccose ring near its middle, as 
illustrated at Q, q; this ring originates by the rupture of the thin 
general wrapper K of the infant plant. 

Like all widely spread and much-cultivated plants, the edible 
T The earlier 15th-century form of the word was musseroun, 

muscheron, &c, and was adapted from the French mousseron, which 

is generally connected with mousse, moss. 



mushroom has numerous varieties, and it differs in different 
places and under different modes of culture in much the same 
way as our kitchen-garden plants differ from the type they have 
been derived from, and from each other. In some instances 
these differences are so marked that they have led some 
botanists to regard as distinct species many forms usually 
esteemed by others as varieties only. 




Fig. 1. — Pasture Mushroom {Agaricus campestris). 

A small variety of the common mushroom found in pastures has 
been named A. pratensis] it differs from the tyDe in having a pale 
reddish-brown scaly top, and the flesh on being cut or broken 
changes to pale rose-colour. A variety still more marked, with a 
darker brown cap and the flesh changing to a deeper rose, and 
sometimes blood-red, has been described as -4. rufescens. The 
well-known compact variety of mushroom-growers, with its white 
cap and dull purplish clay-coloured gills, is -4. hortensis. .Two 
sub-varieties of this have been described under the names of A. 
Buchanani and A. elongatus, and other distinct forms are known to 
botanists. A variety also grows in woods named -4. silvicola; this 
can only be distinguished from the pasture mushroom by its elongated 
bulbous stem and itsextemally smooth cap. There is also a fungus 
well known to botanists and cultivators which appears to be inter- 
mediate between the pasture variety and the wood variety, named 
A. vapor arius. The large rank horse mushroom, now generally 
referred to as A. arvensis, is probably a variety of the pasture mush- 
room ; it grows in rings in woody places and under trees and hedges 
in meadows; it has a large scaly round cap, and the flesh quickly 
changes to buff or brown when cut or broken ; the stem too is hollow. 
An unusually scaly form of this has been described as Asvillaticus 
and another as A. augustus. 

A species, described by Berkeley and Broome as distinct from 
both the pasture mushroom and horse mushroom, has been pub- 
lished under the name of A. elvensis. This grows under oaks, in 
clusters — a most unusual character for the mushroom, and is said 
to be excellent for the table. An allied fungus peculiar to woods, 
with a less fleshy cap than the true mushroom, with hollow stem, 
and strong odour, has been described as a close ally of the pasture 
mushroom under the name of A. silvaticus; its qualities for the table 
have not been recorded. 

Many instances are on record of symptoms of poisoning, and 
even death, having followed the consumption of plants which have 
passed as true mushrooms; these cases have probably arisen from 
the examples consumed being in a state of decay, or fiom some mis- 
take as to the species eaten. It should always be specially noted 
whether the fungi to be consumed are in a fresh and wholesome 
condition, otherwise they act as a poison in precisely the same way 
as does any other semi-putrid vegetable. Many instances are on 
record where mushroom-beds have been invaded by a growth of 
strange fungi and the true mushrooms have been ousted to the advan- 
tage of the new-comers. When mushrooms arc gathered for sale 
by persons unacquainted with the different species mistakes are of 
frequent ^ occurrence. A very common spurious mushroom in 
markets is A. velutinus, a slender, ringless, hollow-stemmed, black- 
billed fungus, common in gardens and about dung and stumps; it 
is about the size of a mushroom, but thinner in all its parts and far 
more brittle ; it has a black hairy fringe hanging round the edge of the 
cap when fresh. Another spurious mushroom, and equally common 
in dealers' baskets, is A. lacrymdbundus ; this grows in the same posi- 
tions as the last, and is somewhat fleshier and more like a true mush- 
room; it has a hollow stem and a slight ring, the gills are black-brown' 
mottled and generally studded with tear-like drops of moisture. 
In both these species the gills distinctly touch and grow on to the 
stem. Besides these there are numerous other black-gilled species 
which find a place in baskets — some species far too small to bear 



MUSHROOM

any resemblance to a mushroom, others large and deliquescent, 
generally belonging to the stump- and dung-borne genus Coprinus. 
The true mushroom itself is to a great extent a dung-borne species, 
therefore mushroom-beds are always liable to an invasion from other 
dung-borne forms. The spores of all fungi are constantly floating 
about in the air, and when the spores of dung-infesting species 
alight on a mushroom-bed they find a nidus already prepared that 
exactly suits them; and if the spawn of the new-comer becomes 
more profuse than that of the mushroom the stranger takes up his 
position at the expense of the mushroom. There is also a fungus 
named Xylaria vaporaria, which sometimes fixes itself on mushroom- 
beds and produces such an enormous quantity of string-like spawn 
that the entire destruction of the bed results. This spawn is some- 
times so profuse that it is pulled out of the beds in enormous masses 
and carted away in barrows. 

Sometimes cases of poisoning follow the consumption of what 
have really appeared to gardeners to be true bed-mushrooms, and 
to country folks as small horse mushrooms. The case is made more 
complicated by the fact that these highly poisonous forms now and 
then appear upon mushroom-beds to the exclusion of the mush- 
rooms. This dangerous counterfeit is A. fastibilis, or sometimes A. 
crustuliniformis, a close ally if not indeed a mere variety of the first. 
A description of one will do for both, A. fastibilis being a little the 
more slender of the two. Both have fleshy caps, whitish, moist and 
clammy to the touch ; instead of a pleasant odour, they have a dis- 
agreeable one; the stems are ringless, or nearly so; and the gills, 
which are palish-clay-brown, distinctly touch and grow on to the 
solid or pithy stem. These two fungi usually grow in woods, but 
sometimes in hedges and in shady places in meadows, or even, as has 
been said, as invaders on mushroom-beds. The pale clay-coloured 
gills, offensive odour, and clammy or even viscid top are decisive 
characters. A reference to the accompanying illustration (fig. 2), 
which is about one-half natural size, will give a good idea of A. 
fastibilis; the difference in the nature of the attachment of the gills 
near the stem is seen at R, the absence of a true ring at s, and of a 
pendent frill at t. The colour, with the exception of the gills, is 
not unlike that of the mushroom. In determining fungi no single 
character must be relied upon as conclusive, but all the characters 
must be taken together. Sometimes a beautiful, somewhat slender, 
fungus peculiar to stumps in woods is mistaken for the mushroom in 
A. cervinus; it has a tall, solid, white, ringless stem and somewhat 
thin brown cap, furnished underneath with beautiful rose-coloured 
gills, which are free from the stem as in the mushroom, and which

never turn black. It is probably a poisonous plant, belonging, as it 
does, to a dangerous cohort. Many other species of A garicus more 
or less resemble A. campsstris, notably some of the plants found 
under the sub-genera Lepiota, Volvaria, Pholiota and Psalliota; 
but when the characters are noted they may all with a little care 
be easily distinguished from each other. The better plan is to 
discard at once all fungi which have not been gathered from open 
pastures; by this act atone more than nine-tenths of worthless and 
poisonous species will be excluded. 

In cases of poisoning by mushrooms immediate medical advice 
should be secured. The dangerous principle is a narcotic, and the 
symptoms are usually great nausea, drowsiness, stupor and pains 
in the joints. A good palliative is sweet oil; this will allay any 
corrosive irritation of the throat and stomach, and at the same 
time cause vomiting. 

Paris mushrooms are cultivated in enormous quantities in dark 
underground cellars at a depth of from 60 to 160 ft. from the surface. 
The stable manure is taken into the tortuous passages of these cellars, 
and the spawn introduced from masses of dry dung where it occurs 
naturally. In France mushroom-growers do not use the compact 
blocks or bricks of spawn so familiar in England, but much smaller 
flakes or '• leaves " of dry dung- in which the spawn or mycelium can 
be seen to exist. Less manure is used in these cellars than we 
generally see in the mushroom-houses of England, and the surface 
of each bed is covered with about an inch of fine white stony soil. 
The beds are kept artificially moist by the application of water 
brought from the surface, and the different galleries bear crops in 
succession. As one is exhausted another is in full bearing, so that 



by a systematic arrangement a single proprietor will send to the 
surface from 300 lb to 3000 lb of mushrooms per day. The passages 
sometimes extend over several miles, the beds sometimes occupying 
over 20 m., and, as there are many proprietors of cellars, the produce 
of mushrooms is so large that not only is Paris fully supplied, but 
vast quantities are forwarded to the different large towns of Europe; 
the mushrooms are not allowed to reach the fully expanded condi- 
tion, but are gathered in a large button state, the whole growth of 
the mushroom being removed and the hole left in the manure 
covered with fine earth. The beds remain in bearing for six or 
eight months, and then the spent manure is taken to the surface 
again for garden and field purposes. The equable temperature of 
these cellars and their freedom from draught is one cause of their 
great success; to this must be added the natural virgin spawn, 
For by continually using spawn taken from mushroom-producing 
beds the potency for reproduction is weakened. The beds produce 
mushrooms in about six weeks after this spawning. 

The common mushroom (A garicus campestris) is propagated by 
spores, the fine black dust seen to be thrown off when a mature speci- 
men is laid on white paper or a white dish ; these give rise to what 
is known as the " spawn " or mycelium, which consists of whitish 
threads permeating dried dung or similar substances, and which, 
when planted in a proper medium, runs through the mass, and even- 
tually develops the fructification known as the mushroom. This 
•spawn may be obtained from old pastures, or decayed mushroom 
beds, and is purchased from nurserymen in the form of bricks 
charged with the mycelium, and technically known as mushroom 
spawn. When once obtained, it may^ be indefinitely preserved. 
It may be produced by placing quantities of horse-dung saturated 
with the urine of horses, especially of stud horses, witn alternate 
layers of rich earth, and covering the whole with straw, to exclude 
rain and air; the spawn commonly appears in the heap in about 
two months afterwards. The droppings of stall-fed horses, or of 
such as have been kept on dry food, should be made use of. 

The old method of growing mushrooms in ridges out of doors, or 
on prepared beds either level or sloping from a back wall in sheds or 
cellars, may generally Jbe adopted with success. The beds are formed 
of horse-droppings which have been slightly fermented and frequently 
turned, and may be made 2 or 3 it. broad and of any length. A layer 
of dung about 8 or 10 in. thick is first deposited, and covered with a 
light dryish earth to the depth of 2 in.; and two similar layers with 
similar coverings are added, the whole being made narrower as it 
advances in height. When the bed is finished, it is covered with 
straw to protect it from rain, and also from parching influences. 
In about ten days, when the mass is milkwarm, the bed will be 
ready for spawning, which consists of inserting small pieces of spawn 
bricks into the sloping sides of the bed, about 6 in. asunder. A layer 
of fine earth is then placed over the whole, and well beaten down, 
and the surface is covered with a thick coat of straw. When the 
weather is temperate, mushrooms will appear in about a month after 
the bed has been made, but at other times a much longer period may 
elapse. The principal things to be attended to are to preserve a 
moderate state of moisture and a proper mild degree of warmth; 
and the treatment must vary accoroing to the season. 

These ordinary ridge beds furnish a good supply towards the end 
of summer, and in autumn. To command a regular supply, how- 
ever, at all seasons, the use of a mushroom-house will be found very 
convenient. The material employed in all cases is the droppings of 
horses, which should be collected fresh, and spread out in thin layers 
in a dry place, a portion of the short litter being retained well mois- 
tened by horse-urine. It should then be thrown together in ridges 
and frequently turned, so as to be kept in an incipient state of fer- 
mentation, a little dryish friable loam being mixed with it to retain 
the ammonia given off by the dung. With this or a mixture of 
horse-dung, loam, old mushroom-bed dung, and half-decayed leaves, 
the beds are built up in successive layers of about 3 in. thick, each 
layer being beaten firm, until the bed is 9 or 10 in. thick. If the heat 
exceeds 80 °, holes should be made to moderate the fermentation. 
The beds are to be spawned when the heat moderates, and the surface 
is then covered with a sprinkling of warmed loam, which. after 
a few days is made up to a thickness of 2 in., and well beaten down. 
The beds made partly of old mushroom-bed dung often contain 
sufficient spawn to yield a crop, without the introduction of brick or 
cake spawn, but it is advisable to spawn them in the regular way. 
The spawn should be introduced an inch or two below^ the surface 
when the heat has declined to about 75 °, indeed the bed ought never 
to exceed 80 °. The surface is to be afterwards covered with hay or 
litter. The atmospheric temperature should range from 6o° to 65 
till the mushrooms appear, when it may drop a few degrees, but not 
lower than 55 . If the beds require watering, water of about^ 8o° 
should be used, and it is preferable to moisten the covering of litter 
rather than the surface 01 the beds themselves. It is also beneficial, 
especially in the case of partially exhausted beds, to water with a 
dilute solution of nitre. For a winter supply the beds should be 
made towards the end of August, and the end of October. Slugs 
and woodlice are the worst enemies of mushroom crops. 

The Fairy-ring Champignon. — This fungus, Marasmius Oreades, 
is more universally used in France and Italy than in England, 
although it is well known and frequently used both in a fresh and in 
a dry state in England. It is totally different in appearance from the

MUSIC 



pasture mushroom, and, like it, its characters are so distinct that 
there is hardly a possibility of making a mistake when its peculiari- 
ties are once comprehended. It has more than one advantage 
over the meadow mushroom in its extreme commonness, its profuse 
growth, the length of the season in which it may be gathered, the 
total absence of varietal forms, its adaptability for being dried and 
preserved for years, and its persistent delicious taste. It is by many 
esteemed as the best of all the edible fungi found in Great Britain. 
Like the mushroom, it grows in short open pastures and amongst 
the short grass of open roadsides; sometimes it appears on lawns, 
but it never occurs in woods or in damp shady places. Its natural 
habit is to grow in rings, and the grassy fairy-rings so frequent 
amongst the short grass of downs and pastures in the spring are 
generally caused by the nitrogenous manure applied to^ the soil 
in the previous autumn by the decay of a circle of these fungi. Many 
other fungi in addition to the fairy-ring champignon grow in circles, 
so that this habit must merely be taken with its other characters in 
cases of doubt. • 

r A glance at the illustration (fig. 3) will show how entirely the fairy- 
ring champignon differs from the mushroom. In the first place, it 




Fig. 3. — The Fairy- ring Champignon {Marasmius oreades). 

is about one-half the size of a mushroom, and whitish-buff in every 
part, the gills always retaining this colour and never becoming 
salmon-coloured, brown or black. The stem is [solid and corky, 
much more solid than the flesh of the cap, and perfectly smooth, 
never being furnished with the slightest trace of a ring. The buff- 
gills are far apart (v), and in this they greatly differ from the some- 
what crowded gills of the mushroom; the junction of the gills with 
the stem (w) also differs in character from the similar junction in the 
mushroom. The mushroom is a semi-deliquescent fungus which 
rapidly falls into putridity in decay, whilst the champignon dries 
up into a leathery substance in the sun, but speedily revives and takes 
its original form again after the first shower. To this character the 
fungus owes its generic name (Marasmius) as well as one of its most 
valuable qualities for the table, for examples may be gathered from 
June to November, and if carefully dried may be hung on strings 
for culinary purposes and preserved without deterioration for several 
years; indeed, many persons assert that the rich flavour of these 
fungi increases with years. Champignons are highly esteemed (and 
especially is this the case abroad) for adding a most delicious flavour 
to stews, soups and gravies. 

A fungus which may carelessly be mistaken for the mushroom is 
M. peronatus, but this grows in woods amongst dead leaves, and has a 
hairy base to the stem and a somewhat acrid taste. Another is M. 
urens; this also generally grows in woods, but the gills are not nearly 
so deep, they soon become brownish, the stem is downy, and the taste 
is acrid. An Agaricus named A. dryophilus has sometimes been 
gathered in mistake for the champignon, but this too grows in woods 
where the champignon never grows; it has a hollow instead of a solid 
stem, gills crowded together instead of far apart, and flesh very 
tender and brittle instead of tough. ^ A small esculent ally of the 
champignon, named M. scovodonius y is sometimes found in pastures 
in Great Britain; this is largely consumed on the Continent, where 
it is esteemed for its powerful flavour of garlic. In England, where, 
garlic is not used to a large extent, this fungus is not sought for. 
Another small and common species, M. porreus, is pervaded with a 
garlic flavour to an equal extent with the last. A third species, 
M. alliaceus, is also strongly impregnated with the scent and taste 
of onions or garlic. Two species, ilf. impudicus and M. foetidus, 
are in all stages of growth highly fcetid. The curious little edible 
Agaricus esculentus, although placed under the sub-genus CollyUa, 
is allied by its structure to Marasmius. It is a small bitter species 
common in upland pastures and fir plantations early in the season. 
Although not gathered for the table in England, it is greatly prized 
in some parts of the Continent. 

MUSIC, — The Greek fiovaucfj (sc. rexvyj), from which this 
word is derived, was used very widely to embrace all those 
arts over which the Nine Muses (MoDcrcu) were held to preside. 
Contrasted with yviivaarud) (gymnastic) it included those 
branches of education concerned with the development of the 
mind as opposed to the body. Thus such widely different arts 
and sciences as mathematics, astronomy, poetry and literature 



generally, and even reading and writing would all fall under 
fiovawf}, besides the singing and setting of lyric poetry. On 
the educational value of music in the formation of character 
the philosophers laid chief stress, and this biased their aesthetic 
analysis. 'Apfwvla (harmony), or apftoviKr} (sc. rexyij), rather 
than fxovGLKrj, was the name given by the Greeks to the art of 
arranging sounds for the purpose of creating a definite aesthetic 
impression, with which this article deals. 

I. — General Sketch 

1. Introduction. — As a mature and independent art music 
is unknown except in the modern forms realized by Western 
civilization; ancient music, and the non-European music of the 
present day, being (with insignificant exceptions of a character 
which confirms the generalization) invariably an adjunct of poetry 
or dance, in so far as it is recognizable as an art at all. The 
modern art of music is in a unique position; for, while its language 
has*been wholly created by art, this language is yet so perfectly 
organized as to be in itself natural; so that though the music 
of one age or style may be at first unintelligible to a listener 
who is accustomed to another style, and though the listener 
may help' himself by acquiring information as to the char- 
acteristics and meaning of the new style, he will best learn to 
understand it by merely divesting his rriind of prejudices and 
allowing the music to make itself intelligible by its own self- 
consistency. The understanding^ music thus finally depends 
neither upon xedinlcaT"knowledge nor upon convention, but 
upon the listener's immediate and familiar experience of it; 
an experience which technical knowledge and custom can of 
course aid him to acquire more rapidly, as they strengthen 
his memory and enable him to fix impressions by naming 
them. 

Beyond certain elementary facts of acoustics (see Sound), 
modern music shows no direct connexion with nature inde- 
pendently of art; indeed, it is already art that determines the 
selection of these elementary acoustic facts, just as in painting 
art determines the selection of those facts that come under the 
cognizance of optics. 1 In music, however, the purely acoustic 
principles are incomparably fewer and simpler than the optical 
principles of painting, - and their artistic interaction transforms 
them into something no less remote from the laboratory 
experiments of acoustic science than from the unorganized 
sounds of nature. The result is that while the ordinary non- 
artistic experiences of sight afford so much material for plastic 
art that the vulgar conception of good painting is that it is 
deceptively like nature, the ordinary non-artistic experience 
of sound has so little in common with music that musical 
realism is, with rare though popular exceptions, generally 
regarded as an eccentricity. 

This contrast between music and plastic art may be partly 
explained by the mental work undergone, during the earliest 
infancy both of the race and of the individual, in interpreting 
sensations of space. When a baby learns the shape of objects 
by taking them in his hands, and gradually advances to the 
discovery that his toes belong to him, he goes through an 
amount of work that is quite forgotten by the adult, and its 
complexity and difficulty has perhaps only been fully realized 
through the experience of persons who have been born blind 
but have acquired sight at a mature age by an operation.' Such 
work gives the facts of normal adult vision an amount of organic 
principle that makes them admirable raw material for art. 
The power of distinguishing sensations of sound is associated 
with no such mental skill, and is no more complex than the 
power of distinguishing colours. On the other hand, sound 
13 the principal medium by which most of the higher animals 
both express and excite emotion; and hence, though until 

1 Thus Chinese and Japanese art has attained high organization 
without the aid of a veracious perspective; while, on the other hand, 
its carefully formulated decorative principles, though not realistic, 
certainly rest on an optical and physiological basis. Again, many 
modern impressionists justify their methods by an appeal to pheno- 
menaof complementary colour which earlier artists possibly aid not 
perceive and certainly did not select as artistic materials.

codified into human speech it does not give any raw material 
for art, yet so powerful are its primitive effects that music 
(in the bird-song sense of sound indulged in for its own attractive- 
ness) is as long prior to language as the brilliant colours of 
animals and flowers are prior to painting (see Song). Again, 
sound as a warning or a menace is eminently important in the 
history of the instinct of self-preservation; and, above all, its 
production is instantaneous and instinctive. 

All these facts, while they tend to make musical expression 
an early phenomenon in the history of life, are extremely 
unfavourable to the early development of musical art. They 
invested the first musical attempts with a mysterious power 
over listener and musician, by rc-awakening instincts more 
powerful, because more ancient and necessary, than any that 
could ever have been appealed to by so deliberate a process 
as that of drawing on a flat surface a series of lines calculated 
to remind the eye of the appearance of solid objects in space. 
It is hardly surprising that music long remained as imperfect 
as its legendary powers were portentous, even in the hands of 
so supremely artistic a race as that of classical Greece; and what- 
ever wonder this backwardness might still arouse in us vanishes 
when we realize the extreme difficulty of the process by which 
the principles of the modern art were established. 

2. Non-harmonic and Greek Music. — Archaic music is of 
two kinds — the unwritten, or spontaneous, and the recorded, 
or scientific. The earliest musical art-problems were far too 
difficult for conscious analysis, but by no means always beyond 
the reach of a lucky hit from an inspired singer; and thus folk- 
music often shows real beauty where the more systematic music 
of the time is merely arbitrary. Moreover, folk-music and the 
present music of barbarous and civilized non-European races 
furnish the study of musical origins with material analogous to 
that given by the present manners and customs of different races 
in the study of social evolution and ancient history. We may 
mention as examples the accurate comparison of the musical 
scales of non-European races undertaken by A. J. Ellis {On 
the Musical Scales of Various Nations, 1885); the parallel 
researches and acute and cautious reasoning of his friend and 
- collaborator, A. J. Hipkins (Ddrian and Phrygian reconsidered 
from a Non-harmonic Point of View, 1902); and, perhaps most 
of all, the study of Japanese music, with its remarkable if 
uncertain signs of the beginning of a harmonic tendency, its 
logical coherence, and its affinity to Western scales, points 
in which it seems to show a great advance upon the Chinese 
music from which most of it is derived (Music and Musical 
Instruments of Japan, by J. F. Piggott, 1893). The reader will 
find detailed accounts of ancient Greek music in the article 
on that subject in Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians 
(new ed., ii. 223) and in Monro's Modes of Ancient Greek Music 
(Clarendon Press, 1894), while both the Greek music itself, 
and the steps by which it passed through Graeco-Roman and 
early Christian phases to become the foundation of the modern 
art, are traced as clearly as is consistent with accuracy in 
The Oxford History of Music, vol. i., by Professor Wooldridge. 
Sir Hubert Parry's Evolution of the Art of Music (" International 
Scientific Series," originally published under the title of The 
Art of Music) presents the main lines of the evolution of modern 
musical ideas in the clearest and most readable form yet 
attained. 

Sir Hubert Parry illustrates in this work the artificiality of 
our modern musical conceptions by the word " cadence," 
which to a modern musician belies its etymology, since it 
normally means for him no " falling " close but a pair of final 
chords rising from dominant to tonic. Moreover, in consequence 
of our harmonic notions we think of scales as constructed from 
the bottom upwards; and even in the above-mentioned article 
in Grove's Dictionary all the Greek scales are, from sheer force 
of habit, written upwards. But the ancient and, almost 
universally, the primitive idea of music is like that of speech, 
in which most inflections are in fact cadences, while rising 
inflexions express less usual sentiments, such as surprise or 
interrogation. Again, our modern musical idea of " high " 



and " low " is probably derived from a sense of greater and less 
vocal effort; and it has been much stimulated by our harmonic 
sense, which has necessitated a range of sounds incomparably 
greater than those employed in any non-harmonic system. 
The Greeks derived their use of the terms from the position 
of notes on their instruments; and the Greek hypate was what 
we should call the lowest note of the mode, while nete was the 
highest. Sir George Macfarren has pointed out (Ericy. Brit., 
9th ed., art. " Music ") that Boethius (c. a.d. 500) already fell 
into the trap and turned the Greek modes upside down. l 

Another radical though less grotesque misconception was 
also already well exploded by Macfarren ; but it still frequently 
survives at the present day, since the study of non-harmonic 
scales is, with the best of intentions, apt rather to encourage 
than to dispel it. The more we realize the importance of 
differences in position of intervals of various sizes, as producing 
differences of character in scales, the more irresistible is the 
temptation to regard the ancient Greek modes as differing from 
each other in this way. And the temptation becomes greater 
instead of less when we have succeeded in thinking away our 
modern harmonic notions. Modern harmonization enormously 
increases the differences of expression between modes of which 
the melodic intervals are different, but it does this in a fashion 
that draws the attention almost entirely away from these 
differences of interval; and without harmony we find it extremely 
difficult to distinguish one mode from another, unless it be 
by this different arrangement of intervals. Nevertheless, all 
the evidence irresistibly tends to the conclusion that while the 
three Greek genera — diatonic, chromatic, and enharmonic — 
were scales differing in intervals, the Greek modes were a series 
of scales identical in arrangement of interval, and differing, 
like our modern keys, only in pitch. The three genera were 
applied to all these modes or keys, and we have no difficulty 
in understanding their modifying effects. But the only clue 
we have to the mental process by which in a preharmonic age 
different characteristics can be ascribed to scales identical in 
all but pitch, is to be found in the limited compass of Greek 
musical sounds, corresponding as it does to the evident sensitive- 
ness of the Greek ear to differences in vocal effort. We have 
only to observe the compass of the Greek scale to see that in 
the most esteemed modes it is much more the compass of speaking 
than of singing voices. Modern singing is normally at a much 
higher pitch than that of the speaking voice, but there is no 
natural reason, outside the peculiar nature of modern music, 
why this should be so. It is highly probable that all modern 
singing would strike a classical Greek ear as an outcry; and 
in any case such variations of pitch as are inconsiderable in 
modern singing are extremely emphatic in the speaking voice,, 
so that they might well make all the difference to an ear un- 
accustomed to organized sound beyond the speaking compass. 
Again, much that Aristoxenus and other ancient authorities 
say of the character of the modes (or keys) tends to confirm 
the view that that character depends upon the position of the 
mese or keynote within the general compass. Thus Aristotle 
{Politics, v. (viii.) 7, 1342 b. 20) states that certain low-pitched 
modes suit the voices of old men, and thus we may conjecture 
that even the position of tones and semitones might in the 
Dorian and Phrygian modes bring the bolder portion of the 
scale in all three genera into the best regions of the average 
young voice, while the Ionian and Lydian might lead the voice 
to dwell more upon semitones and enharmonic intervals, and 
so account for the heroic character of the former and the sensual 
character of the latter (Plato, Republic, 398 to 400). 

Of the Greek genera, the chromatic and enharmonic (especially 

1 It is worth adding that in the 16th century the great contrapun- 
tal composer Costanzo Porta had been led by doubts on the subject 
to the wonderful conclusion that ancient Greek music was poly- 
phonic, and so constructed as to be invertible ; in illustration of which 
theory he and Vincentino composed four-part motets in each of the 
Greek genera (diatonic, chromatic and enharmonic), Porta's being 
constructed like the 12th and 13th fugues in Bach's Kunst der Fuge 
so as to be equally euphonious when sung upside down! (See 
Hawkins's History of Music, i. 112.)

the latter) show very clearly the origin of so many primitive 
scales in the interval of the downward fourth. That interval 
\e.g. from C to G) is believed to be the earliest melodic relation- 
ship which the ear learnt to fix; and most of the primitive scales 
were formed by the accretion of auxiliary notes at the bottom 
of this interval, and the addition of a similar interval, with 
similar accretions, below the former. In this way a pentatonic 
scale, like that of so many Scotch melodies, can easily be formed 
(thus, C, A, G; F, D, C); and though some primitive scales seem 
to have been on the nucleus of the rising fifth,' while the Siamese 
now use two scales of which not a single note within the octave 
can be accounted for by any known principle, still we may 
consider that for general historic purposes the above example 
is typical. The Greeks divided their downward fourth into 
four notes, called a tetrachord; and by an elaborate system of 
linking tetrachords together they gave their scale a compass 
of two octaves. The enharmonic tetrachord, being the most 
ancient, gathered the lower three notes very closely to the 
bottom, leaving the second note no less than a major third 
from the top, thus — C,Ab, G', G; (where G' stands for a note 
between Ab and G). The chromatic tetrachord was C, Bbb, 
Ab, G; and the diatonic tetrachord was C, Bb, Ab, G. It is this 
last that has become the foundation of modern music, and the 
Greeks themselves soon preferred it to the other genera and 
found a scientific basis for it. In the first place they noticed 
that its notes (and/less easily, the notes of the chromatic scale) 
could be connected by a series of those intervals which they 
recognized as concordant. These were, the fourth; its converse, 
or inversion, the fifth; and the octave. The notes of the enhar- 
monic tetrachord could not be connected by any such series. 
In the articles on Harmony and Sound account is given of 
the historic and scientific foundations of the modern conception 
of concord; and although this harmonic conception applies 
to simultaneous notes, while the Greeks concerned themselves 
only with successive notes, it is nevertheless permissible to 
regard the Greek sense of concord in successive notes as con- 
taining the germ of our harmonic sense. The stability of the 
diatonic scale was assured as early as the 6th century B.C. when 
Pythagoras discovered (if he did not learn from Egypt or India) 
the extremely simple mathematical proportions of its intervals. 
And this discovery was of unique importance, as fixing the 
intervals by a criterion that could never be obscured by the 
changes of taste and custom otherwise inevitable in music that 
has no conscious harmonic principles to guide it. At the same 
time, the foundation of a music as yet immature and ancillary 
to drama, on an acoustic science ancillary to a priori mathe- 
matics, was not without disadvantage to the art; and it is 

.arguable that the great difficulty with which during the 
medieval beginnings of modern harmony the concords of the 
third and sixth were rationalized may have been increased by 
the fact that the Pythagorean system left these intervals con- 
siderably out of tune. In preharmonic times mathematics 
could not direct even the most observant ear to the study of 
those phenomena of upper partials of which Helmholtz, in 
1863, was the first to explain the significance; and thus though 
the Greeks knew the difference between a major and minor 
tone, on which half the question depended, they could not 
possibly arrive at the modern reasons for adding both kinds 
of tone in order to make the major third. (See Sound.) 

Here we must digress in order to illustrate what is implied 

' by our modern harmonic sense; for the difference that this 
makes to our whole musical consciousness is by no means uni- 
versally realized. Music, as we now understand it, expresses 
itself in the interaction of three elements — rhythm, melody and 
harmony. The first two are obviously as ancient as human 
consciousness itself. Without the third a musical art of per- 
manent value and intelligibility has not been known to attain 
independent existence. With harmony music assumes the 
existence of a kind of space in three dimensions, none of which 
can subsist without at least implying the others. When we 
hear an unaccompanied melody we cannot help interpreting 
it in the light of its most probable harmonies. Hence, when 



it does not imply consistent harmonies it seems to us quaint 
or strange; because, unless it is very remote from our harmonic 
conceptions, it at least implies at any given moment some 
simple harmony which in the next moment it contradicts. 
Thus our inferences as to the expression intended by music 
that has not come under European influence are unsafe, and 
the pleasure we take in such music is capricious. The effort of 
thinking away our harmonic preconceptions is probably the 
most violent piece of mental gymnastics in all artistic experience, 
and furnishes much excuse for a sceptical attitude as to the 
artistic value of preharmonic music, which has at all events 
never become even partially independent of poetry and dance. 
Thus the rhythm of classical Greek music seems to have been 
entirely identical with that of verse, and its beauty and ex- 
pression appreciated in virtue of that identity. From the modern 
musical point of view the rhythm of words is limited to a merely 
monotonous uniformity of flow, with minute undulations which 
are musically chaotic (see Rhythm). ' The example of Greek 
tragedy, with the reports of its all-pervading music (in many 
cases, as in that of Aeschylus, composed by the dramatist 
himself) could not fail to fire the imaginations of modern pioneers 
and reformers of opera; and Monteverde, Gluck and Wagner 
convinced themselves and their contemporaries that their work 
was, amongst other things, a revival of Greek tragedy. But all 
that is known of Greek music shows that it represents no such 
modern ideas, as far as their really musical aspect is concerned. 
It represents, rather, an organization of the rise and fall of the 
voice, no doubt as elaborate and artistic as the organization 
of verse, no doubt powerful in heightening the emotional and 
dramatic effect of words and action, but in no way essential 
to the understanding or the organization of the works which it 
adorned. The classical Greek preference for the diatonic scale 
indicates a latent harmonic sense and also that temperance 
which is at the foundation of the general Greek sense of beauty; 
but, beyond this and similar generalities, all the research in the 
world will not enable us to understand the Greek musician's 
mind. Non-harmonic music is a world of two dimensions, and 
we must now inquire how men came to rise from this " flatland " 
to the solid world of sound in which Palestrina, Bach, Beethoven 
and Wagner live. 

3. Harmonic Origins. — Although the simultaneous blending 
of different sounds was never seriously contemplated by the 
Greeks, yet in classical times they were fond of singing with 
high and low voices in octaves. This was called magadizing, 
from the name of an instrument on which playing in octaves 
was rendered easy by means of a bridge that divided the strings 
at two-thirds of their length. While the practice was esteemed 
for the beauty of the blending of different voices, it was tolerated 
only because of the peculiar effect of identity furnished by 
the different notes of the octave, and no other interval was so 
used by the Greeks. In the article on Harmony the degrees of 
identity-in-difference which characterize the simpler harmonic 
intervals are analysed, and the main steps are indicated by which 
the more complicated medieval magadizing uses of the fourth 
and fifth (the symphonia, diaphonia or organum of Hucbald) 
gave way (partly by their own interchange and partly through 
experiments in the introduction of ornaments and variety) 
to the modern conception of harmony as consisting of voices 
or parts that move independently to the exclusion of such parallel 
motion. In The Oxford History of Music, vols. i. and ii., will 
be found abundant examples of every stage of the process, 
which begins with the organum or diaphony that prevailed 
until the death of Guido of Arezzo (about 1050) and passes 
through the discant, or measured music, of the 13th century, 
in which rhythm is first organized on a sufficiently firm basis to 
enable voices to sing contrasted rhythms simultaneously, 
while the new harmonic criterion of the independence of parts 
more and more displaces and shows its opposition to the old 
criterion of parallelism. 

The most extraordinary example of these conflicting principles 
is the famous rota " Sumer is icumen in," a 13th-century round 
in four parts on a canonic ground-bass in two. Recent researches 



GENERAL SKETCH] 



MUSIC 



75 



have brought to light a number of works in the forms of motet, 
conduetus, rondel (neither the later rondo nor the round, but a 
kind of triple counterpoint), which show that " Sumer is icumen 
in " contains no unique technical feature; but no work within 
two centuries of its date attains a style so nearly intelligible 
to modern ears. Its richness and firmness of harmony are 
such that the frequent use of consecutive fifths and octaves, 
in strict accordance with 13th-century principles, has to our 
ears all the effect of a series of grammatical blunders, so sharply 
does it contrast with the smooth counterpoint of the rest. In 
what light this smooth counterpoint struck contemporaries, 
or how its author (who may or may not be the writer of the 
Reading MS., John of Fornsete) arrived at it, is not clear, 
though W. S. Rockstro's amusing article, " Sumer is icumen 
in," in Grove's Dictionary, is very plausible. All that we know is 
that music in England in the 13th century must have been at 
a comparatively high state of development; and we may also 
conjecture that the tuneful character of this wonderful rota 
has something in common with the unwritten but famous 
songs of the aristocratic troubadours, or trouveres, of the 12th 
and 13th centuries, who, while disdaining to practise the art of 
accompaniment or the art of scientific and written music, 
undoubtedly set the fashion in melody, and, being themselves 
poets as well as singers, formed the current notions as to the 
relations between musical and poetic rhythm. The music 
of Adam de la Hale, surnamed Le Bossu d'Arras (c. 1230-1288), 
shows the transformation of the troubadour into the learned 
musician; and, nearly a century later, the more ambitious 
efforts of a greater French poet (like his contemporary Petrarca, 
one of Chaucer's models in poetic technique), Guiilaume de 
Machault {ft. 1350), mark a further technical advance, though they 
are not appreciably more intelligible to the modern ear. 

In the next century we find an Englishman, John Dunstable, 
who had as early as 1437 acquired a European reputation; 
while his works were so soon lost sight of that until recently 
he was almost a legendary character, sometimes revered as the 
" inventor " of counterpoint, and once or twice even identified 
with St Dunstan! Recently a great deal of his work has come 
to light, and it shows us (especially when taken in connexion 
with the fact that the early Netherlandish master, G. Dufay, 
did not die until 1474, twenty-one years after Dunstable) that 
English counterpoint was fully capable of showing the composers 
of the Netherlands the path by which they were to reach the 
art of the " Golden age." In such examples of Dunstable's work 
as that appended to the article " Dunstable " in Grove's 
Dictionary (new ed., i. 744) we see music approaching a style 
more or less consistently intelligible to a modern ear; and in 
English Carols of the 15th Century (1891) several two-part 
compositions of the period, in a style resembling Dunstable's, 
have been made accessible to modern readers and filled out into 
four-part music by the editor " in accordance with the rules 
of the time." And though it may be doubted whether Mr 
Rockstro's skill would not have been held in the 15th century to 
savour overmuch of the Black Art, still the success of his attempt 
shows that the musical conceptions he is dealing with are no 
longer radically different from those of our modern musical 
consciousness. 

4. The Golden Age. — The struggle towards the realization 
of mature musical art seems incredibly slow when we do not 
realize its difficulty, and wonderfully rapid as soon as we attempt 
to imagine the effort of first forming those harmonic conceptions 
which are second nature to us. Even at the time of Dunstable 
and Dufay the development of the contrapuntal idea of inde- 
pendence of parts had not yet so transformed the harmonic 
consciousness that the ancient parallelisms or consecutive 
fourths and fifths that were the backbone of discant could 
be seen in their true light as contradictory to the contrapuntal 
method. By the beginning of the 16th century, however, the 
laws of counterpoint were substantially fixed; practice was 
for a while imperfect, and aims still uncertain, but skill was 
increasing and soon became marvellous; and in 16th-century 
music we leave the archaic world altogether. Henceforth music 



may show various phenomena of crudeness, decadence and 
transition, but its transition-periods will always derive light 
from the past, whatever the darkness of the future. 

In the best music of the 16th century we have no need of 
research or mental gymnastics, beyond what is necessary in 
all art to secure intelligent presentation and attention. Its 
materials show us the " three dimensions " of music in their 
simplest state of perfect balance. Rhythm, emancipated from 
the tyranny of verse, is free to co-ordinate and contrast a multi- 
tude of melodies which by the very independence of their flow 
produce a mass of harmony that passes from concord to concord 
through ordered varieties of transitional discord. The criterion 
of discord is no longer that of mere harshness, but is modified 
by the conception of the simplicity or remoteness of the steps 
by which the flux of independent simultaneous melodies passes 
from one concord, or point of repose, to another. When the 
music reaches a climax, or its final conclusion, the point of 
repose is, of course, greatly emphasized. It is accordingly the 
" cadences " or full closes of 16th-century music that show 
the greatest resemblance to the harmonic ideas of the present 
day; and it is also at these points that certain notes were most 
frequently raised so as to modify the ecclesiastical modes which 
are derived more or less directly from the melodic diatonic 
scale of the Greeks, and misnamed, according to inevitable 
medieval misconceptions, after the Greek modes. 1 

In other passages our modern ears, when unaccustomed to 
the style, feel that the harmony is strange and lacking in definite 
direction; and we are apt to form the hasty conclusion that the 
mode is an archaic survival. A more familiar acquaintance 
with the art soon shows that its shifting and vague modulations 
are no mere survival of a scale inadequate for any but melodic 
purposes, but the natural result of a state of things in which only 
two species of chord are available as points of repose at all. If 
no successions of such chords were given prominence, except those 
that define key according to modern notions based upon a much 
greater variety of harmony, the resulting monotony and triviality 
would be intolerable. Moreover, there is in this music just 
as much and no more of formal antithesis and sequence as its 
harmony will suffice to hold together. Lastly, we shall find, 
on comparing the masterpieces of the period with works of 
inferior rank, that in the masterpieces the most archaic modal 
features are expressive, varied and beautiful; while in the inferior 
works they are often avoided in favour of ordinary modern 
ideas, and, when they occur, are always accidental and monoto- 
nous, although in strict conformity with the rules of the time. 
The consistent limitations of harmony, form and rhythm have 
the further consequence that the only artistic music possible 
within them is purely vocal. The use of instruments is little 
more than a necessary evil for the support of voices in case of 
insufficient opportunity for practice; and although the origins 
of instrumental music are already of some artistic interest in 
the 16th century, we must leave them out of our account if our 
object is to present mature artistic ideas in proper proportions. 

The principles of 16th-century art-forms are discussed in 
more detail in the article on Contrapuntal Forms. Here we 
will treat the formal criteria on a general basis; especially as 
with art on such simple principles the distinction between one 
art-form and another is apt to be either too external or too 
subtle for stability. With music there is a stronger probability 
than in any other art that merely mechanical devices will be 
self-evident, and thus they may become either dangerous or 
effective. With the masters of the Netherlands they speedily 
became both. Two adjacent groups of illustrations in Burney's 

l The technical nature of the subject forbids us to discuss the 
origin and characteristics of the great Ambrosian and Gregorian 
collections of melodic church music on which nearly all medieval 
and 16th-century polyphony was based, and from which the ecclesi- 
astical modes were derived. Professor Wooldridge in The Oxford 
History of Music, i. 20-44, has shown- the continuity of this early 
Christian music with the Graeco-Roman music, and the origin of its 
modesin the Ptolemaic modification (c. a.d. 150) of the Greek 
diatonic scale; while a recent defence of the ecclesiastical tradi- 
tion of a revision by St Gregory will be found in the article on 
" Gregorian music " in Grove's Dictionary (new ed.), ii. 235.

MUSIC 



[GENERAL SKETCH 



History of Music will show on the one hand the astonishing 
way in which early polyphonic composers learnt to " dance 
in fetters," and, on the other hand, the expressive power that 
they attained by that discipline. Burney quotes from the 
venerable 15th-century master Okeghem, or Okenheim, some 
canons so designed as to be singable in all modes. They are 
by no means extreme cases of the ingenuity which Okenheim 
and his pupils often employed; but though they are not very 
valuable artistically (and are not even correctly deciphered 
by Burney) 1 they prove that mechanical principles may be a 
help rather than a hindrance to the attainment of a smooth 
and plastic style. Burney most appropriately follows them 
with Josquin Des PreVs wonderful Defloration de Jehan Okenheim, 
in which the tenor sings the plain chant of the Requiem a degree 
below its proper pitch, while the other voices sing a pastoral 
dirge in French. The device of transposing the plain chant a 
note lower, and making the tenor sing it in that position through- 
out the whole piece, is obviously as mechanical as any form of 
acrostic: but it is happily calculated to impress our ears, even 
though, unlike Josquin's contemporaries, most of us are not 
familiar with the plain chant in its normal position; because 
it alters the position of all the semitones and gives the chant 
a plaintive minor character which is no less impressive in itself 
than as a contrast to the orthodox form. And the harmonic 
superstructure is as fine an instance Of the expressive possibilities 
of the church modes at their apogee from modern tonality as 
could be found anywhere. A still nobler example, which we 
may perhaps acclaim as the earliest really sublime masterpiece 
in music, is Josquin's Miserere, which is accessible in a modern 
edition. In this monumental work one of the tenor parts is 
called Vagans, because it sings the burden Miserere met Dens 
at regular intervals, in an almost monotonous wailing figure, 
wandering through each successive degree of the scale throughout 
the composition. The effect, aided as it is by consummate 
rhetorical power in every detail of the surrounding mass of 
harmony and counterpoint, is extremely expressive; and the 
device lends itself to every shade of feeling in the works of the 
greatest of all Netherland masters, Orlando di Lasso. Palestrina 
is less fond of it. Like all more obvious formal devices it is 
crowded out of his Roman art by the exquisite subtlety of his 
sense of proportion, and the exalted spirituality of his style 
which, while it allows him to set the letters of the Hebrew alphabet 
in the Lamentations of Jeremiah in much the same spirit as 
that in which they would be treated in an illuminated Bible, 
forbids him to stimulate a sense of form that might distract 
the mind from the sense of mystery and awe proper to objects 
of devout contemplation. Yet in one of his greatest motets, 
Tribularer si nescirem, the burden of Josquin's M iserere appears 
with the same treatment and purpose as in its prototype. 

But with the lesser Flemish masters, and sometimes with 
the greatest, such mechanical principles often became not only 
inexpressive but absolutely destructive to musical effect. The 
ingenuity necessary to make the stubborn material of music 
plastic was not so easily attainable as the ingenuity necessary 
to turn music into a mathematical game; and when Palestrina was 
in his prime the inferior composers so outnumbered the masters 
to whom music was a devout language, and so degraded the 
art, not only by ousting genuine musical expression but by 
foisting secular tunes and words into the church services, that 
one of the minor questions with which the Council of Trent 
was concerned was whether polyphonic church music should be 
totally abolished with other abuses, or whether it was capable 
of reform. Legendary history relates that Palestrina submitted 
for judgment three masses of which the Missa papae Marcelli 
proved to be so sublime that it was henceforth accepted as the 
jdeal church music (see Palestrina). This tale is difficult to 
reconcile with the chronology of Palestrina's works, but there is 
no doubt that Palestrina was officially recognized by the Church 
as a bulwark against bad taste. But we must not allow 
this to mislead us as to the value of church music before

Palestrina. Nor must we follow the example of Bairn, who, 
in his detestation of what he is pleased to call fiammingo squalore, 
views with uncritical suspicion any work in which Palestrina 
does not confine himself to strictly Italian methods of expression. 
A notion still prevails that Josquin represents counterpoint in 
an anatomical perfection into which Palestrina was the first 
to breathe life and soul. This gives an altogether inadequate 
idea of 16th-century music. Palestrina brought the century to a 
glorious close and is undoubtedly its greatest master, but he 
is primus inter pares; and in every part of Europe music was 
represented, even before the middle of the century, by masters 
who have every claim to immortality that sincerity of aim, 
completeness of range, and depth and perfection of style can 
give. It has been rightly called the golden age of music, and 
our chronological table at the end of this article gives but an 
inadequate idea of the number of its masters whom no lover 
of music ought to neglect. It is not exclusively an age of church 
music. It is also the age of madrigals, both secular and spiritual; 
and, small as was its range of expression, there has been no 
period in musical art when the distinctions between secular and 
ecclesiastical style w T ere more accurately maintained by the great 
masters, as is abundantly shown by the test cases in which 
masses of the best period have been based on secular themes. 
(See Madrigal.) 

5. The Monodic Revolution and its Results. — Like all golden 
ages, that of music vanished at the first appearance of a knowledge 
beyond its limitations. The first and simplest realization of 
mature art is widespread and nourishes a veritable army of great 
men; its masterpieces are innumerable, and its organization 
is so complete that no narrowness or specialization can be felt 
in the nature of its limitations. Yet these are exceedingly 
close, and the most modest attempt to widen them may have 
disastrous results. Many experiments were tried before Pales- 
trina's death and throughout the century, notably by the 
elder and younger Gabrieli. Perhaps Palestrina himself is 
the only great composer of the time who never violates the 
principles of his art. Orlando di Lasso, unlike Palestrina, 
wrote almost as much secular as sacred music, and in his youth 
indulged in many eccentricities in a chromatic style which he 
afterwards learnt to detest. But if experiments are to revolu- 
tionize art it is necessary that their novelty shall already embody 
some artistic principle of coherence. No such principle will 
avail to connect the Phrygian mode with a chord containing A#; 
and, however proud the youthful Orlando di Lasso may be at 
being the first to write A#, neither his early chromatic experiments 
nor those of Cipriano di Rore, which he admired so much, left 
a mark on musical history. They appealed to nothing deeper 
than a desire for sensational variety of harmony; and, while 
they carried the successions of chords far beyond the limits 
of the modes, they brought no new elements into the chords 
themselves. 

By the beginning of the 17th century the true revolutionary 
principles were vigorously at work, and the powerful genius 
of Monteverde speedily made it impossible for men of impres- 
sionable artistic temper to continue to work in the old 
style when such vast new regions of thought lay open to 
them. In the year of Palestrina's death, 1594, Monteverde pub- 
lished, in nis third book of madrigals, works in which without 
going irrevocably beyond the letter of 16th-century law he showed 
far more zeal for emotional expression than sense of euphony. 
In 1 599 he published madrigals in which his means of expression 
involve harmonic principles altogether incompatible with 16th- 
century ideas. But he soon ceased to place confidence in the 
madrigal as an adequate art-form for his new ideals of expression, 
and he found an unlimited field in musical drama. Dramatic 
music received its first stimulus from a group of Florentine 
dilettanti, who aspired amongst other things to revive the ideals of 
Greek tragedy. Under their auspices the first true opera 
ever performed in public, Jacopo Peri's Euridice, appeared in 
1600. Monteverde found the conditions of dramatic music 
more favourable to his experiments than those of choral music, 
in which both voices and ears are at their highest sensibility

to discord. Instruments do not blend like voices; and players, 
producing their notes by more mechanical means, have not 
the singer's difficulty in making combinations which the car 
does not readily understand. 

The one difficulty of the new art was fatal: there were no 
limitations. When Monteverde introduced his unprepared 
discords, the effect upon musical style was like that of intro- 
ducing modern metaphors into classical Greek. There were 
no harmonic principles to control * the new material, except 
those which just sufficed to hold together the pure 16th-century 
style; and that style depended on an exquisite continuity of 
flow which was incompatible with any rigidity either of har- 
mony or rhythm. Accordingly there were also no rhythmic 
principles to hold Monteverde's work together, except such 
as could be borrowed from types of secular and popular music 
that had hitherto been beneath serious attention. If the 17th 
century seems almost devoid of great musical names it is not 
for want of incessant musical activity. The task of organizing 
new resources into a consistent language was too gigantic to 
be accomplished within three generations. Its fascinating 
dramatic suggestiveness and incalculable range disguised for 
those who first undertook it the fact that the new art was as 
difficult and elementary in its beginnings as the very beginning 
of harmony itself in the 13th and 14th centuries. And the 
most beautiful compositions at the beginning of the 17 th century 
are rather those which show the decadence of 16th-century art 
than those in which the new principles were most consistently 
adopted. Thus the madrigals of Monteverde, though often 
dull and always rough, contain more music than his operas. 
On the other hand, almost until the middle of the 17th century 
great men were not wanting who still carried on the pure 
polyphonic style. Their asceticism denotes a spirit less compre- 
hensive than that of the great artists for whom the golden age 
was a natural environment; but in parts of the world where the 
new influences did not yet prevail even this is not the case, 
and a composer like Orlando Gibbons, who died in 1625, is 
well worthy to be ranked with the great Italian and Flemish 
masters of the preceding century. 

But the main task of composers of the 17th century lay 
elsewhere; and if the result of their steady attention to it was 
trivial in comparison with the glories of the past, it at least 
led to the glories of the greater world organized by Bach and 
Handel. The early monodists, Monteverde and his fellows, 
directed attention to the right quarter in attempting to express 
emotion by means of single voices supported by instruments; 
but the formless declamation of their dramatic writings soon 
proved too monotonous for permanent interest, and such method 
as it showed became permanent only by being codified into 
the formulas of recitative, which are, for the most part, very 
happy idealizations of speech-cadence, and which accordingly 
survive as dramatic elements in music at the present day, 
though, like all rhetorical figures, they have often lost meaning 
from careless use. 1 It was all very well to revolutionize current 
conceptions of harmony, so that chords were no longer considered, 
as in the days of pure polyphony, to be the result of so many 
independent melodies. But in art, as elsewhere, new thought 
eventually shows itself as an addition to, not a substitute for, 
the wisdom of ages. Moreover, it is a mistake, though one 
endorsed by high authorities, to suppose that the 16th-century 
composers did not appreciate the beauty of successions of chords 
apart from polyphonic design. On the contrary, Palestrina 
and Orlando di Lasso themselves are the greatest masters the 
world has ever seen of a style which depends wholly on the 
beauty of masses of harmony, entirely devoid of polyphonic 
detail, and held together by a delicately balanced rhythm in 
which obvious symmetry is as carefully avoided as it is in the 
successions of chords themselves. Nevertheless, the monody 
of the 17th century is radically different in principle, not only 
because chords^ are used which were an outrage on 16th- 

l The " invention " of recitative is frequently ascribed to this or 
that monodist, with as little room for dispute as when we ascribe 
the invention of clothes to Adam and Eve. All monody was recita- 
tive, if only from inability to organize melodies. 



century ears, but because the fundamental idea is that of a 
solo voice declaiming phrases of paramount emotional interest, 
and supported by instruments that play such chords as will 
heighten the poignancy of the voice. And the first advance 
made on this chaotic monody consisted, not in the reintroduction 
of vitality into the texture of the harmonies, but in giving formal 
symmetry and balance to the vocal surface. This involved the 
strengthening of the harmonic system, so that it could carry 
the new discords as parts of an intelligible scheme, and not 
merely as uncontrollable expressions of emotion. In other words, 
the chief energies of the successors of the monodists were devoted 
to the establishment of the modern key-system; a system in 
comparison with which the subtle variety of modal concord 
sounded vague and ill-balanced, until the new key-system 
itself was so safely established that Bach and Beethoven could 
once more appreciate and use essentially modal successions of 
chords in their true meaning. 

The second advance of the monodic movement was in the 
cultivation of the solo voice. This developed together with 
the cultivation of the violin, the most capable and expressive 
of the instruments used to support it. Monteverde already 
knew how to make interesting experiments with violins, such 
as directing them to play pizzicato, and accompanying an excited 
description of a duel by rapidly repeated strokes on a major 
chord, followed by sustained dying harmonies in the minor. 
By the middle of the century violin music is fairly common, 
and the distinction between Sonata da Mesa and Sonata da 
camera appears (see Sonata). But the cultivation of instru- 
mental technique had also a great effect on that of the voice; 
and Italian vocal technique soon developed into a monstrosity 
that so corrupted musical taste as not only to blind the contem- 
poraries of Bach and Handel to the greatness of their choral 
art, but, in Handel's case, actually to swamp a great deal of 
his best work. The balance between a solo voice and a group 
of instruments was, however, successfully cultivated together 
with the modern key-system and melodic form; with the result 
that the classical aria, a highly effective art-form, took shape. 
This, while it totally destroyed the dramatic character of opera 
for the next hundred years, yet did good service in furnishing 
a reasonably effective means of musical expression which could 
encourage composers and listeners to continue cultivating the 
art until the day of small things was past. The operatic aria, 
as matured by Alessandro Scarlatti, is at its worst a fine oppor- 
tunity for a gorgeously dressed singer to display feats of vocal 
gymnastics, either on a concert platform, or in scenery worthy 
of the Drury Lane pantomime. At its best it is a beautiful 
means of expression for the devout fervour of Bach and Handel. 
At all times it paralyses dramatic action, and no more ironic 
revenge has ever overtaken iconoclastic reformers than the 
historic development by which the purely dramatic declama- 
tion of the monodists settled down into a series of about thirty 
successive displays of vocalization, designed on rigidly musical 
conventions, and produced under spectacular conditions by 
artificial sopranos as the highest ideal of music-drama. 

The principal new art -forms of the 17 th century are then, 
firstly, the aria (not the opera, which was merely a spectacular 
condition under which people consented to listen to some thirty 
arias in succession) ; and, secondly, the polyphonic instrumental 
forms, of which those of the suite or sonata da camera were 
mainly derived from the necessity for ballet music in the opera 
(and hence greatly stimulated by the taste of the French court 
under Louis XIV.), while those of the Sonata da chiesa were also 
inspired by a renaissance of interest in polyphonic texture. 
The sonata da chiesa soon settled into a conventionality only 
less inert than that of the aria because violin technique had 
wider possibilities than vocal; but when Lulli settled in France 
and raised to a higher level of effect the operatic style suggested 
by Cambert, he brought with him justr enough of the new instru- 
mental polyphony to make his typical form of French overture 
(with its slow introduction in dotted rhythm, and its quasi-fugal 
allegro) worthy of the important place it occupies in Bach's and 
Handel's art.

MUSIC 



[GENERAL SKETCH 



Meanwhile great though subordinate activity was also shown 
in the evolution of a new choral music dependent upon an instru- 
mental accompaniment of more complex function than that of 
mere support. This, in the hands of the Neapolitan masters, 
was destined to lead straight to the early choral music of Mozart 
and Haydn, both of whom, especially Mozart, subsequently 
learnt its greater possibilities from the study of Handel. But the 
most striking choral art of the time came from the Germans, 
who never showed that thoughtless acquiescence in the easiest 
means of effect which was already the bane of Italian art. 
Consequently, while the German output of the 17th century fails 
to show that rapid attainment of modest maturity which gives 
much Italian music of the period a permanent if slight artistic 
value, there is, in spite of much harshness, a stream of noble 
polyphonic effort in both organ and choral music in Germany 
from the time of H. Schutz (who was horn in 1585 and who was a 
great friend and admirer of Monteverde) to that of Bach and 
Handel just a century later. Nor was Germany inactive in the 
dramatic line, and the 17th-century Italian efforts in comic opera, 
which are so interesting and so unjustly neglected by historians, 
found a parallel, before Handel's maturity, in the work of 
R. Reiser, and may be traced through him in Handel's first 
opera, Altnira. 

The best proof of the insufficiency of 17th-century resources 
is to he found in the almost tragic blending of genius and failure 
shown by our English church music of the Restoration. The 
works of Pelham Humfrey and Blow already show the qualities 
which with Purcell seem at almost any given moment to amount 
to those of the highest genius, while hardly a single work has 
any coherence as a whole. The patchiness of Purceirs music 
was, no doubt, increased by the influence of French taste then 
predominant at court. When Pelham Humfrey was sixteen, 
King Charles II., as Sir Hubert Parry remarks, " achieved the 
characteristic and subtle stroke of humour of sending him over 
to France to study the methods of the most celebrated composer 
of theatrical music of the time in order to learn how to compose 
English church music." Yet it is impossible to see how such 
ideas as Purcell's could have been presented in more than French 
continuity of flow by means of any designs less powerful than 
those of Bach and Handel. PurceH's ideas are, like those of 
all great artists, at least sixty years in advance of the normal 
intellect of the time. But they are unfortunately equally in 
advance of the only technical resources then conceivable; and 
Purcell, though one of the greatest contrapuntists that ever 
lived, is probably the only instance in music of a man of really 
high genius born out of due time. Musical talent was certainly 
as common in the 17th century as at any other time; and if we 
ask why, unless we are justified in counting Purcell as a tragic 
exception, the whole century shows not one name in the first 
artistic rank, the answer must be that, after all, artistic talent 
is far more common than the interaction of environment and 
character necessary to direct it to perfect artistic results. 

6. Bach and Handel. — It was not until the 18th century had 
begun that two men of the highest genius could find in music a 
worthy expression of their grasp of life. Bach and Handel were 
born within a month of each other, in 1685, and in the same part 
of Saxony. Both inherited the tradition of polyphonic effort 
that the German organists and choral writers had steadily 
maintained throughout the 17th century; and both profited by 
the Italian methods that were penetrating Germany. In Bach's 
case it was the Italian art-forms that appealed to his sense of 
design. Their style did -not affect him, hut he saw every possi- 
bility which the forms contained, and studied them the more 
assiduously because they were not, like polyphonic texture, his 
birthright. In recitative his own distinctively German style 
attained an intensity and freedom of expression which is one of 
the most moving things in art. Nevertheless, if he handled 
recitative in his own way it was not for want of acquaintance 
with the Italian formulas, nor even because he despised them; 
for in his only two extant Italian works the scraps of recitative 
are strictly in accordance with Italian convention, and the 
arias show (when we allow for their family likeness with Bach's 



normal style) the most careful modelling upon Italian forms. 
Again, as is well known, Bach arranged with copious additions 
and alterations many concertos by Vivaldi (together with some 
which though passing under Vivaldi's name are really by German 
contemporaries) ; and, while thus taking every opportunity of 
assimilating Italian influences in instrumental as well as in vocal 
musk, he was no less alive to the importance of the French 
overture and suite forms. Moreover, he is very clear as to where 
his ideas come from, and extremely careful to maintain every 
art-form in its integrity. Yet his style remains his own through- 
out, and the first impression of its resemblance to that of his 
German contemporaries diminishes the more the period is studied. 
Bach's art thus forms one of the most perfectly systematic 
and complete records a life's work has ever achieved. His 
art-forms might be arranged in a sort of biological scheme, and 
their interaction and genealogy has a clearness which might 
almost be an object of envy to men of science even if Bach had 
not demonstrated every detail of it by those wonderful re- 
writings of his own works which we have described elsewhere 
(see Bach). 

Handel's methods were as different from Bach's as his circum- 
stances. He soon left Germany and, while he never betrayed 
his birthright as a great choral writer, he quickly absorbed the 
Italian style so thoroughly as to become practically an Italian. 
He also adopted the Italian forms, but not, like Bach, from any 
profound sense of their possible place in artistic system. To 
him they were effective, and that was all. He did not trouble 
himself about the permanent idea that might underlie an art- 
form and typify its expression. He has no notion of a form as 
anything higher than a rough means of holding music together 
and maintaining its flow; but he and Bach, alone among their 
contemporaries, have an unfailing sense of all that is necessary 
to secure this end. They worked from opposite points of view: 
Bach develops his art from within, until its detail, like that of 
Beethoven's last works, becomes dazzling with the glory of the 
whole design; Handel at his best is inspired by a magnificent 
scheme, in the execution of which he need condescend to finish 
of detail only so long as his inspiration does not hasten to the 
next design. Nevertheless it is to the immense sweep and 
breadth of Handel's choral style, and its emotional force, that all 
subsequent composers owe their first access to the larger and 
less mechanical resources of music. (See Handel.) 

7. The Symphonic Classes. — After the death of Bach and 
Handel another change of view, like that Copernican revolution 
for which Kant sighed in philosophy, was necessary for the 
further development of music. Once again it consisted in an 
inversion of the relation between form and texture. But, 
whereas at the beginning of the 17th century the revolution 
consisted mainly in directing attention to chords as, so to speak, 
harmonic lumps, instead of moments in a flux of simultaneous 
melodies; in the later half of the 18th century the revolution 
concerned the larger musical outlines, and was not complicated 
by the discovery of new harmonic resources. On the contrary, 
it led to an extreme simplicity of harmony. The art of Bach 
and Handel had given perfect vitality to the forms developed 
in the 18th century, but chiefly by means of the reinfusion of 
polyphonic life. The formal aspects (that is, those that decree 
the shapes of aria and suite-movement and the balance and 
contrasts of such choruses as arc not fugues) are, after all, of 
secondary importance; the real centre of Bach's and Handel's 
technical and intellectual activity is the polyphony; and the 
more the external shape occupies the foreground the more the 
work assumes the character of light music. In the article 
Sonata Forms we show how this state of things was altered, 
and attention is there drawn to the dramatic power of a music 
in which the form is technically prior to the texture. And it 
is not difficult to understand that Gluck's reform of opera would 
have been a sheer impossibility if he had not dealt with music 
in the sonata style, which is capable of changing its character 
as it unfolds its designs. 

The new period of transition was neither so long nor so inter- 
esting as that of the 17th century. The contrast between the

79 



squalid beginnings of the new -'art and the glories of Bach and 
Handel is almost as great as that between the monodists and 
Palestrina, but it appeals far less to our sympathies, because it 
seems like a contrast between noble sincerity and idle elegance. 
The new art seems so easy-going and empty that it conceals 
from us the necessity of the sympathetic historical insight for 
which the painful experiments of the monodists almost seem to 
cry aloud. And its boldest rhetorical experiments, such as the 
fantasias of Philipp Emanuel Bach, show a security of harmony 
which, together with the very vividness of their realization of 
modern ideas, must appear to a modern listener more like the 
hollow rhetoric of a decadent than the prophetic inspiration 
of a pioneer. And, just as in the 17th century, so in the time 
before Haydn and Mozart, the work that is most valuable artis- 
tically tends to be that which is of less importance historically. 
The cultivation of the shape of music at the expense of its texture 
was destined to lead to greater things than polyphonic art had 
ever dreamt of; but no living art could be achieved until the 
texture was brought once more into vital, if subordinate, relation 
to the shape. Thus, far more interesting artistically than the 
epoch-making earlier pianoforte works of Philipp Emanuel Bach 
are his historically less fruitful oratorios, and his symphonies, 
and the rich polyphonic modifications of the new principles 
in the best works of his elder brother Friedemann. Yet the tran- 
sition-period is hardly second in historic importance to that of 
the 17th century; and we may gather from it even more direct 
hints as to the meaning of the tendencies of our own day. 

As in the 17th century, so in the 18th the composers and 
critics of Haydn's youth, not knowing what to make of the new 
tendencies, and conscious rather of the difference between new 
and old ideas than of the true nature of either, took refuge in 
speculations about the emotional and external expression of 
music; and when artistic power and balance fail it is very con- 
venient to go outside the limits of the art and explain failure 
away by external ideas. Fortunately the external ideas were 
capable of serious organic function through the medium of opera, 
and in that art-form music was passing out of the hands of 
Italians and assuming artistic and dramatic life under Gluck. 
The metaphysical and literary speculation which overwhelmed 
musical criticism at this time, and which produced paper warfares 
and musical party-feuds such as that 'between the Gluckists 
and the Piccinists, at all events had this advantage over the 
Wagnerian and anti-Wagnerian controversies of the last genera- 
tion and the disputes about the legitimate function of instru- 
mental music at the present day — that it was speculation applied 
exclusively to an art-form in which literary questions were 
directly concerned, an art-form which moreover had up to that 
time been the grave of all the music composers chose to put 
into it. But as soon as music once more attained to consistent 
principles all these discussions became but a memory. If Gluck's 
music had not been more musical as well as more dramatic than 
Piccini's, all its foreshadowing of Wagnerian principles would 
have availed it no more than it availed Monteverde. 

When the new art found symphonic expression in Haydn and 
Mozart, it became music pure and simple, and yet had no more 
difficulty than painting or poetry in dealing with external 
ideas, when these were naturally brought into it by the human 
voice or the conditions of dramatic action. It had once more 
become an art which need reject or accept nothing on artificial or 
extraneous grounds. Beethoven soon showed how gigantic the 
scale and range of the sonata style could be, and how tremendous 
was its effect on the possibilities of vocal music, both dramatic 
and choral. No revolution was needed to accomplish this. 
The style was perfectly formed, and for the first and so far the 
only time in musical history a mature art of small range opened 
out into an equally perfect one of gigantic range, without a 
moment of decadence or destruction. The chief glory of the 
art that culminates in Beethoven is, of course, the instrumental 
music, all of which comes under the head of the sonata-forms 

Meanwhile Mozart raised comic opera, both Italian and 
German, to a height which has never since been approached 



within the classical limits, and from which the operas of Rossini 
and his successors show a decadence so deplorable that if 
" classical music " means " high art " we must say that classical 
opera buff a begins and ends in Mozart. But Gluck, finding his 
dramatic ideas encouraged by the eminent theatrical sensibilities 
of the French, had already given French opera a stimulus 
towards the expression of tragic emotion which made the classics 
of the French operatic school well worthy to inspire Beethoven 
to his one noble operatic effort and Weber to the greatest works 
of his life. Cherubini, though no more a Frenchman than 
Gluck, was Gluck's successor in the French classical school of 
dramatic music. His operas, like his church music, account for 
Beethoven's touching estimation of him as the greatest composer 
of the time. In them his melodies, elsewhere curiously cold and 
prosaic, glow with the warmth of a true classic; and his tact in 
developing, accelerating and suspending a dramatic climax is 
second only to Mozart's. Scarcely inferior to Cherubini in 
mastery and dignity, far more lovable in temperament, and 
weakened only by inequality of invention, Mehul deserves a far 
higher place in musical history than is generally accorded him. 
His most famous work, Joseph, is of more historical importance 
than his others, but it is by no means his hest from a purely 
musical point of view, though its Biblical subject impelled 
Mlhul to make extremely successful experiments in " local 
colour "• which had probably considerable influence upon 
Weber, whose admiration of the work was boundless. One 
thing is certain, that the romantic opera of Weber owes much 
of its inspiration to the opira comique of these masters. 1 

8. From Beethoven to Wagner. — After Beethoven comes 
what is commonly though vaguely described as the " romantic " 
movement. In its essentials it amounts to little more than 
this, that musicians found new and prouder titles for a very 
ancient and universal division of parties. The one party set up 
a convenient scheme of form based upon the average procedure 
of all the writers of sonatas except Haydn and Beethoven, 
which scheme they chose to call classical; while the other party 
devoted itself to the search for new materials and new means of 
expression. The classicists, if so they may be called, did not 
quite approve of Beethoven; and while there is much justification 
for the charge that has been brought against them of reducing 
the sonata-form to a kind of game, they have for that very 
reason no real claim to be considered inheritors of classical 
traditions. The true classical method is that in which matter 
and form are so united that it is impossible to say which is 
prior to the other. The pseudo-classics arc the artists who set 
up a form conveniently like the average classical form, and fill 
it with something conveniently like the average classical matter, 
with just such difference as will seem like an advance in brilliance 
and range. The romanticists are the artists who realize such a 
difference between their matter and that of previous art as impels 
them to find new forms for it, or at all events to alter the old 
forms considerably. But if they are successful the difference 
between their work and that of the true classics becomes merely 
external; they are classics in a new art-form. As, however, 
this is as rare as true classical art is at the best of times, romanti- 
cism tends *to mean little more than the difference between an 
unstable artist who cannot master his material and an artist 
who can, whether on tlje pseudo-classical or the true classical 
plane. The term " romantic opera " has helped us to regard 
Weber as a romanticist in that sphere, but when we call his instru- 
mental works " romantic " the term ceases to have really 
valuable meaning. As applied to pieces like the Concertstiick, 
the Invitation a la dame, and other pieces of which the external 
subject is known either from Weber's letters or from the titles 
of the pieces themselves, the term means simply " programme- 
music " such as we have seen to be characteristic of any stage 
in which the art is imperfectly mastered. Weber's programme- 
music shows no advance on Beethoven in the illustrative 
resources of the art; and the application of the term " romantic " 

1 We must remember in this connexion that the term op&ra 
comique means simply opera with spoken dialogue, and has nothing 
to do with the comic idea.

[GENERAL SKETCH 



to his interesting and in many places beautiful pianoforte 
sonatas has no definite ground except the brilliance of his piano- 
forte technique and the helplessness in matters of design (and 
occasionally even of harmony) that drives him to violent and 
operatic outbreaks. 

Schubert also lends some colour to the opposition between 
romantic and classical by his weakness in large instrumental 
designs, but his sense of form was too vital for his defective 
training to warp his mind from the true classical spirit; and the 
new elements he introduced into instrumental music, though not 
ratified by concentration and unity of design, were almost always 
• the fruits of true inspiration and never mere struggles to escape 
from a difficulty. His talent for purely instrumental music was 
incomparably higher than Weber's, while that for stage-drama, 
as shown in the most ambitious of his numerous operas, Fierra- 
bras, was almost nil. But he is the first and perhaps the greatest 
classical song writer. It was Beethoven's work on a larger 
scale that so increased the possibilities of handling remote 
harmonic sequences and rich instrumental and rhythmic effects 
as to prepare for Schubert a world in which music, no less than 
literature, was full of suggestions for that concentrated expres- 
sion of a single emotion which distinguishes true lyric art. And, 
whatever the defects of Schubert's treatment of larger forms, 
his construction of small forms which can be compassed by a 
single melody or group of melodies is unsurpassable and is truly 
classical in spirit and result. 

Schumann had neither Schubert's native talent for larger 
form nor the irresponsible spirit which allowed Schubert to 
handle it uncritically. Nor had he the astounding lightness 
of touch and perfect balance of style with which Chopin con- 
trolled the most wayward imagination that has ever found 
expression in the pianoforte lyric. But he had a deep sense of 
melodic beauty, a mastery of polyphonic expression which 
for all its unorthodox tendency was second only to that of the 
greatest classics, and an epigrammatic fancy which enabled 
him to devise highly artistic forms of music never since imitated 
with success though often unintelligently copied. In his songs 
and pianoforte lyrics his romantic ideas found perfectly mature 
expression. Throughout his life he was inspired by a deep 
reverence which, while it prevented him from attempting to 
handle classical forms with a technique which he felt to be 
inadequate, at the same time impelled him as he grew older to 
devise forms on a large scale externally resembling them. The 
German lyric poetry, which he so perfectly set to music, strength- 
ened him in his tendency to present his materials in an epi- 
grammatic and antithetic manner; and, when he took to writing 
orchestral and chamber music, the extension of the principles 
of this style to the designing of large spaces in rigid sequence 
furnished him with a means of attaining great dignity and weight 
of climax in a form which, though neither classical nor strictly 
natural, was at all events more true in its relationship to his 
matter than that of the pseudo-classics such as Hummel or even 
Spohr. Towards the end of his short life, before darkness 
settled upon his mind, he rose perhaps to his greatest height as 
regards solemnity of inspiration, though none of his later works 
can compare with his early lyrics for artistic perfection. Be this 
as it may, his last choral works, especially the latter parts of 
Faust (which, unlike the first part, was written before his powers 
failed), show that the sense of beauty and polyphonic life with 
which he began his career was always increasing; and if he was 
led to substitute an artificial and ascetic for a natural and 
classical solution of the difficulties of the larger art -forms it was 
only because of his insight into artistic ideals which he felt to be 
beyond his attainment. He shared with Mendelssohn the inevit- 
able misunderstanding of those contemporaries who grouped 
all music under one or other of the two heads, Classical and 
Romantic. 

- There is good reason to believe that Mendelssohn died before 
he had more than begun to show his power, though this may be 
denied by critics who have not thought of comparing Handel's 
career up to the age at which Mendelssohn's ceased. And his 
mastery, resting, like Handel's, on the experience of a boyhood 



comparable only to Mozart's, was far too easy to induce him 
as a critic to reconcile the idea of high talent with distressing 
intellectual and technical failure. This same mastery also 
tended to discredit his own work, both as performer and composer, 
in the estimation of those whose experience encouraged them 
to hope that imperfection and over-excitement were infallible 
signs of genius. And as his facility actually did co-operate with 
the tendencies of the times to deflect much of his work into 
pseudo-classical channels, while nevertheless his independence 
of form and style kept him at all times at a higher level of 
interest and variety than any mere pseudo-classic, it is not to be 
wondered that his reputation became a formidable object of 
jealousy to those apostles of new ideas who felt that their own 
works were not likely to make way against academic opposition 
unless they called journalism to their aid. 

Nothing has more confused, hindered and embittered the 
careers of Wagner and Liszt and their disciples than the paper 
warfare which they did everything in their power to encourage. 
No doubt it had a useful purpose, and, as nothing affords a 
greater field for intrigue than the production of operas, it is at 
least possible that the gigantic and unprecedentedly expensive 
works of Wagner might not even at the present day have 
obtained a hearing if Wagner himself had been a tactful and 
reticent man and his partisans had all been discreet lovers and 
practisers of art. As to Wagner's achievement there is now no 
important difference of opinion. It has survived all attacks 
as the most monumental result music has achieved with the aid 
of other arts. Its antecedents must be sought in many very 
remote regions. The rediscovery, by Mendelssohn, of the choral 
works of Bach, after a century of oblivion, revealed the possi- 
bilities of polyphonic expression in a grandeur which even 
Handel rarely suggested; and inspired Mendelssohn with impor- 
tant ideas in the designing of oratorios as wholes. The complete 
fusion of polyphonic method with external and harmonic design 
had, under the same stimulus, been carried a step further than 
Beethoven by means of Schumann's more concentrated harmonic 
and lyric expression. That wildest of all romanticists, Berlioz, 
though he had less polyphonic sense than any composer who 
ever before or since attained distinction, nevertheless revealed 
important new possibilities in his unique imagination in orches- 
tral colour. The breaking down of the barriers that check 
continuity in classical opera was already indicated by Weber, 
in whose Euryanthe the movements frequently run one into the 
other, while at least twenty different themes are discoverable 
in the opera, recurring, like the Wagnerian leit-motif, in apt 
transformation and logical association with definite incidents 
and persons. 

But many things undreamed of by Weber were necessary to 
complete the breakdown of the classical barriers; for the whole 
pace of musical motion had to be emancipated from the influence 
of instrumental ideas. This was the most colossal reformation 
ever attempted by a man of real artistic balance; and even the 
undoubted, though unpolished, dramatic genius shown in Wag- 
ner's libretti (the first in which a great composer and dramatist 
are one) is but a small thing in comparison with the musical 
problems which Wagner overcomes with a success immeasur- 
ably outweighing any defects his less perfect literary mastery 
allowed to remain in his dramatic structure and poetic diction. 
Apart from the squabbles of Wagnerian and anti-Wagnerian 
journalism, the chief difficulty of his supporters and antagonists 
really lay in this question of the pace of the music and the 
consequent breadth of harmony and design. The opening of 
the Walkiire, in which, before the curtain rises, the sound of 
driving rain is reproduced by very simple sequences that take 
sixteen long bars to move a single step, does not, as instrumental 
music, compare favourably for terseness and variety with the 
first twenty bars of the thunderstorm in Beethoven's Pastoral 
Symphony, where at least four different incidents faithfully 
portray not only the first drops of rain and the distant thunder, 
but all the feelings of depression and apprehension which they 
inspire, besides carrying the listener rapidly through three 
different keys in chromatic sequence. But Beethoven's storm 



GENERAL SKETCH] 



MUSIC

is idealized, in its whole rise and fall, within a space of five 
minutes. Wagner's task is to select five real minutes near the 
end of the storm and to treat them with no greater variety than 
the action of the drama demands. When we have learnt to 
dissociate our minds from irrelevant ideas of an earlier instru- 
mental art, we find that Wagner's broad spaces contain all that 
is necessary. Art on a large scale will always seem to have 
empty spaces, so long as we expect to find in it the kind of detail 
appropriate to art on a smaller scale. 

Wagner's new harmonic resources are of similar and more 
complex but not less legitimate origin. In Derfliegende Hollander 
they are, like his wider rhythmic sweep, imperfectly digested; 
in fact, much of his work before the Meister singer is, in patches, 
debased by the influence of Meyerbeer. But in his later works 
the more closely his harmonic language is studied the more 
conclusively does it show itself to be a logical and mastered 
thing. His treatment of key is, of course, adapted to a state 
of things in which the designs are far too long for the mind to 
attach any importance to the works ending in the key in which 
it began. To compare Wagner's key-system with that of a 
symphony is like comparing the perspective asrLcomposition 
of a panorama with the perspective and composition of an easel 
picture. Indeed the differences are precisely analogous in the 
two cases; and Wagner's sense of harmony and key turns out 
on investigation to be the classical sense truly adapted to its 
new conditions. For this very reason it is in detail quite irrele- 
vant to symphonic art; and there was nothing anti-Wagnerian 
in the reasons why Brahms had so little to do with it in his 
music, although every circumstance of the personal controversies 
and thinly disguised persecutions of Brahms's youth were enough 
to give any upholder of classical symphonic art a rooted prejudice 
to everything bearing the name of " romantic." 

Side by side with Wagner many enthusiasts place Liszt; and 
it is indisputable that Liszt had in mind a larger and slower flow 
of musical sequence closely akin to Wagner's, and, no doubt, 
partly independent of it; and moreover, that one of Liszt's 
aims was to apply this to instrumental music. Also his mastery 
and poetic power as a pianoforte player were faithfully reflected 
in his later treatment of the orchestra, and ensured an extra- 
ordinary rhetorical plausibility for anything he chose to say. 
But neither the princely magnanimity of his personal character, 
which showed itself in his generosity alike to struggling artists 
and to his opponents, nor the great stimulus he gave (both by 
his compositions and his unceasing personal efforts and encour- 
agement) to new musical ideas on romantic lines, ought at this 
time of day to blind us to the hollowness and essential vulgarity 
ol his style. These unfortunate qualities did not secure for his 
compositions immediate popular acceptance ; for they were 
outweighed by the true novelty of his aims. But recently they 
have given his symphonic poems an attractiveness which, while 
it has galvanized a belated interest in those works, has made 
many critics blind to their historical importance as the founda- 
tion of new forms which have undergone a development of 
sensational brilliance under Richard Strauss. 

Meanwhile the party politics of modern music did much to 
distract public attention from the works of Brahms, who 
carried on the true classical method of the sonata-forms in his 
orchestral and chamber music, while he was no less great and 
original as a writer of songs and choral music of all kinds. He 
also developed the pianoforte lyric and widened its range. 
Without losing its characteristic unity it assumed a freedom and 
largeness of expression hitherto only attained in sonatas. Hence, 
however, Brahms's work, like Bach's, seemed, from its continuity 
with the classical forms, to look backward rather than forward. 
Indeed Brahms's reputation is in many quarters that of an 
academic reactionary; just as Bach's was, even at a time when 
the word " academic " was held to be rather a title of honour 
than of reproach. When the contemporary standpoints of 
criticism are established by the production of works of art in 
which the new elements shall no longer he at war with one another 
and with the whole, perhaps it will be recognized once more that 
the idea of progress has no value as a critical standard unless 



it is strictly applied to that principle by which every work of 
art must differ in every part of its form from every other 
work, precisely as far as its material differs and no further. 
Then, perhaps, as the conservative Bach after a hundred years 
of neglect revealed himself as the most profoundly modern force 
in the music of the 19th century, while that of his gifted and 
progressive sons became a forgotten fashion as soon as their 
goal was attained by greater masters, so may the musical epoch 
that seems now to have closed be remembered by posterity as 
the age, not of Wagner and the pioneer Liszt, but the age of 
Wagner and Brahms. 

It will also in all probability be remembered as the age in 
which the performer ceased to be necessarily the intellectual 
inferior of the composer and musical scholar. With the excep- 
tion of Wagner and Berlioz every great composer, since Palestrina 
sang in the papal choir, has paid his way as a performer; but 
Joseph Joachim was the first who threw the whole mind of a 
great composer into the career of an interpreter; and the example 
set by him, Biilow, Clara Schumann and Jenny Lind, though 
followed by very few other artists, sufficed to dispel for ever 
the old association of the musical performer with the mounte- 
bank. 

Joachim's influence on Brahms was incalculable. The two 
composers met at the time when new musical tendencies were 
beginning to arouse violent controversy. At the age of twenty- 
one Joachim had produced in his Hungarian Concerto a work of 
high classical mastery and great nobility, and his technique in 
form and texture was then considerably in advance of Brahms's. 
For some years Joachim and Brahms interchanged contrapuntal 
exercises, and many of the greatest and most perfect of Brahms's 
earlier works owe much to Joachim's criticism. Yet it is 
impossible to regret that Joachim did not himself carry on as 
a composer the work he so nobly began, when we realize the 
enormous influence of his playing in the history of modern music. 
By it we have become familiar with a standard of truthfulness 
in performance which all the generous efforts of Wagner and 
Liszt could hardly have rendered independent of their own 
special propaganda. And hy it the record of classical music has 
been made a matter of genuine public knowledge, with a unique 
freedom from those popularizing tendencies which invest vulgar 
error with the authority of academic truth. 

In this respect there is a real change in the nature of modern 
musical culture. No serious composer at the present day would 
dedicate a great work to. an artist who, like F. Clement, for whom 
Beethoven wrote his Violin Concerto , would perform the work 
in two portions and between them play a sonata for the violin 
on one string with the violin upside down. But it is hardly 
true that Wagner and Liszt produced a real alteration in the 
standard of general culture among musicians. Their work, 
especially Wagner's, appealed, like Gluck's, to many specific 
literary and philosophical interests, and they themselves were 
brilliant talkers; but music will always remain the most self- 
centred of the arts, and men of true culture will measure the 
depth and range of the musician's mind by the spontaneity 
and truthfulness of his musical expression rather than by his 
volubility on other subjects. The greatest musicians have not 
often been masters of more than one language; but they have 
always been men of true culture. Their humanity has been 
illuminated by the constant presence of ideals which their 
artistic mastery keeps in touch with reality.

II. — Recent Music 

Under separate biographical headings, the work of the chief 
modern composers in different countries is dealt with; and heie it 
will be sufficient to indicate the general current of the art, and to 
mention some of the more prominent among recent composers. 

Germany. — On the death of Brahms, the great German composers 
seemed, at the close of the 19th century, to have left no successor. 
Such merely epigonal figures as A. Bungert (b. 1846) and Cyrill 
Kistler (1848-1907) could not be regarded as important; and E. 
Humperdinck's (b. 185^.) striking success with Hansel und Gretel 
(1893) was a solitary triumph in a limited genre. The outstanding 
figure, at the opening of the 20th century^ was Richard Strauss (q.v.) ; 
but it was not so much now in composition, as in the high excel- 
lence of executive art, that Germany still kept up her hegemony in 
European music, by her schools, her great conductors and instru- 
mentalists, and her devotion as a nation to the production of musical 
works. 

France. — From the earliest days of their music, the French have 
had the enviable power of assimilating the great innovations which 
were originated in other countries, without losing their habit of 
warmly appreciating that which their own countrymen produce. 
That which happened with the Netherlandish composers of the 
1 6th century, and with Lulli in the 17th, was repeated, more or 
less exactly, with Rossini in the early part of the 19th century and 
with Wagner at_ its close. During the last quarter of the 19th 
century all that is represented by the once-adored name of Gounod 
was discarded in favour of a style as different as possible from his. 
The change was mainly due to the Belgian musician, C6sar Auguste 
Franck (1 822-1890), who established a kind of informal school of 
symphonic and orchestral composition, as opposed to the con- 
ventional methods pursued at the Paris Conservatoire. Massenet 
was left as almost the only representative of the older school, and 
from Edouard Lalo (1823-1892) to G. Charpcntier (b. i860), all 
the younger composers of France adopted the newer style. With 
these may be mentioned Alfred Bruneau (b. 1857), and Gabriel 
Faur6 (b* 1845). Camille Saint-Saens (b. 1835), however, remained 
the chief representative of the sound school of composition, if only 
by reason of his greater command of resources of every kind and 
his success in all forms of music. Among the newer school of 
composers the most original unquestionably was Debussy (q.v.), 
and among others may be mentioned Ernest Reyer (b. 1823), the 
author of some ambitious and sterling operas ; F. L. V. de Joncieres 
(b. 1839), an enthusiastic follower of Wagner, and a composer of 
merit; Emanuel Chabrier (1841-1894), a man of extraordinary 
gift, who wrote one of the finest operas comiques of modern times, 
Le Roi malgri lui (1887) ; Charles Marie Widor (b. 1845), an earnest 
musician oFgpeat accomplishment; and Vincent d'Indy (b. 1851), a 
strongly original writer, alike in dramatic, orchestral and^ chamber 
compositions. In the class of lighter music, which yet lies above 
the level of opira bouffe, mention must be made of Leo Delibes 
( 1 836-1 891) and Andre" Messager (b. 1855). In describing the 
state of music in France, it would be wrong to pass over the work 
done by the great conductors of various popular orchestral concerts, 
such as Jules E. Pasdeloup (1819-1887), Chas. Lamoureux (1834- 
1899), and Judas [fidouard] Colonne (b. 1838). 

Italy. — In Italy during the last quarter of the 19th century 
many important changes took place. The later development in 
the style ot Verdi (q.v.) was only completed in Otello (1887) and 
Falstaff (1893), while his last composition, the four beautiful sacred 
vocal works, show how very far he had advanced in reverence,

solidity of style and impressiveness, from the time when he wrote 
his earlier operas. And Arrigo Boito's Mefistojele had an immense 
influence on modern Italian music. Among the writers of " abso- 
lute " music the most illustrious are G. Sgambati (b. 1843) and 
G. Martucci (b. 1856), the latter's symphony in D minor being a 
fine work. Meanwhile a younger operatic school was growing up, 
of which the first production was the Flora mirabihs of Spiro 
Samara (b. 1861), given in 1886. Its culmination was in the 
Cavalleria rusticana (1890) of Pietro Mascagni (b. 1863), the 
Pagliacci (1892) of R. Leoncavallo (b. 1858), and the operas of 
Giacomo Puccini (b. 1858), notably Le Villi (1884), Manon Lescaut 
(1893X La Boheme (1896), Tosca (1900), and Madama Butterfly 
(1904). The oratorios of Don Lorenzo Perosi (b. 1872) had an inter- 
esting influence on the church music of Italy, (see Palestrina). 

Russia. — The new Russian school of music originated with M. A. 
Balakirev (b. 1836), who was instrumental in founding the Free 
School of Music at St Petersburg, and who introduced the music 
of Berlioz and Liszt into Russia; he instilled the principles of 
" advanced " music into A. P. Borodin (1 834-1 887), C. A. Cui 
(b. 1835), M. P. Moussorgsky (1839-1881), and N. A. Rimsky- 
Korsakov (1 844-1908), all of whom, as usual with Russian com- 
posers, were, strictly speaking, amateurs in music, having some 
other profession in the absence of any possible opportunity for 
making money out of music in Russia. The most remarkable 
man among their contemporaries was undoubtedly Tschaikovsky 
(q.v.). A. Liadov (b. 1855) excels as a writer for the pianoforte, 
and A. Glazounov (b. 1865) has composed a number of fine orchestral 
works. 

United States. — Of the older American composers, only John 
Knowles Paine (d. 1906) and Dudley Buck (d. 1909), both born in 
1839, and Benjamin Johnson Lang (1837-1909), need be mentioned. 
Paine, professor of music at Harvard University, and composer 
of oratorios, orchestral music, &c, ranks with the advanced school 
of ^romantic composers. Dudley Buck was one of the first American 
composers whoseTiames were known in Europe; and if his numerous 
cantatas and church musicdo not reach a very high standard accord- 
ing to modern ideas, lie did much to conquer the general apathy 
with regard to the existence of original music in the States. Lang, 
prominent as organist and conductor, also became distinguished as 
a composer. George Whitefield Chadwick (b. 1854) has produced 
many orchestral and vocal works of original merit. Though the 
works of Clayton^ Johns (b, 1857) are less ambitious, they have 
won more popularity in Europe, and his songs, like those of Arthur 
Foote (b. 1853), Reginald De Koven (b. 1859), and Ethelbert Nevin 
(1 862-1901), are widely known. Edward Alexander McDowell 
(q.v.) may be regarded as the most original modern American 
composer. Walter Johannes Damrosch (b. 1862), the eminent 
conductor of the New York Symphony Orchestra, and of various 
operatic undertakings, has established his position as an original 
and poetic composer, not only by his opera, The Scarlet Letter t but 
by such songs as the intensely dramatic " Danny Deever." Dr 
Horatio William Parker's (b. 1863) oratorio settings of the hymn 
41 Hora novissinia " and of "The Wanderer's Psalm " are deservedly 
popular. Their masterly workmanship and his power of expression 
in sacred music mark him as a distinct personality. Numerous 
orchestral as well as vocal works have not been heard out of America, 
but a group of songs, newly set to the words of familiar old English 
ditties, have ob tamed great success. Mrs H. H. A. Beach, the 
youngest of the^ prominent composers of the United States and an 
accomplished pia'nist, has attained a high reputation as a writer 
in all the more ambitious forms of music. Many of her songs and 
anthems have obtained wide popularity. The achievements of the 
United States are, however, less marked in the production of new 
composers than in the attention which has been paid to musical 
education and appreciation generally. Henry E. Krehbiel (b. 1854), 
the well-known critic, was especially jprominent in drawing American 
attention to Wagner and Brahms. The New York Opera has been 
made a centre for the finest artists of the day, and the symphony 
concerts at Boston and Chicago have been unn vailed for excellence. 
It is worthy of note that no country has produced a greater number 
of the most eminent of recent singers. Mesdames E. Eames, 
Nordica, Minnie Hauck, Susan Strong, Suzanne Adams, Sybil 
Sanderson, Esther Palliser, Evangeline Florence, and very many 
more among leading sopranos, with Messrs E. E. Oudin, D. Bispham 
and Denis O'Sullivan, to name but three out of the host of excellent 
male artists, proved the natural ability of the Americans in vocal 
music; and it might also be said that the more notable English- 
speaking pupils of the various excellent French schools of voice- 
production are American with hardly an exception. 
, United Kingdom. — English music requires more detailed notice, 
if only because of the striking change in the national feeling with 
regard to it. The nation had been accustomed for so long to 
consider music as an exotic, that, notwithstanding the glories of 
the older schools of English musie, the amount of attention paid to 
everything, that came from abroad, and the rich treasures of tradi- 
tional ana distinctively English music scattered through the country, 
the majority of educated people adhered to the common belief that 
England was not a musical country. The beauty and the enormous 
quantity of traditional Irish music, the enthusiasm created in 
Scotland by trumpery songs written in what was supposed to be 



an imitation of the Scottish style, the existence of the Welsh 
Eisteddfodau, were admitted facts; but England was supposed to 
have had no share in these gifts of nature or art, and the vogue of 
foreign music, from Italian opera to classical symphonies, was held 
as evidence of her poverty, instead of being partly the reason of 
the national sterility. In the successive periods during which the 
music of Handel and Mendelssohn respectively had been held as 
all-sufficient for right-thinking musicians, success could only be 
attained, if at all, by those English musicians who deliberately set 
themselves to copy the style of these great masters; the few men 
who had the determination to resist the popular movement were 
either confined, like the Wesleys, to one branch of music in which 
some originality of thought was still allowed; that of the Church, 
or, like Henry Hugo Pierson in the days of the Mendelssohn worship, 
were driven to seek abroad the recognition they could not obtain 
at home. For a time it seemed as if the great vogue of Gounod 
would exalt him into a third artistic despot; but no native com- 
poser had even the energy to imitate his Faust; and, by the date 
of The Redemption (1882) and Mors el vita (1885), a renaissance of 
English music had already begun. 

For a generation up to the eighties the affairs of foreign opera 
in England were rather depressing ; the rival houses presided over 
by the impresarios Frederick Gye (1810-1878) and Colonel J. H. 
Mapleson (1 828-1 901) had been going from bad to worse; the 
traditions of what were called " the palmy days " had been for- 
gotten, and with the retirement of Christine Nilsson in 1881, and 
the death of Therese J. A. Tietjens in 1877, the race of the great 
queens of song seemed to have come to an end. It is true that 
Mme Patti was in the plenitude of her fame and powers, but the 
number of her impersonations, perfect as they were, was so small 
that she alone could not support the weight of an opera season, 
and her terms made it impossible for any manager to make both 
ends meet unless the rest of the company were chosen on the 
principle enunciated by the husband of Mme Catalani, " Ma femme 
et quatre ou cinq poupees." Mme Albani (b. 1851) had made her 
name famous, but the most important part of her artistic career 
was yet to come.^ She had already brought Tannhauser and 
Lohengrin into notice, but in Italian versions, as was then usual; 
and the great vogue of Wagner's operas did not begin until the series 
of Wagner concerts given at the Royal Albert Hall in 1877 with 
the object of collecting funds for the preservation of the Bayreuth 
scheme, which after the production of the Nibelungen trilogy in 
1876 had become involved in serious financial difficulties. t The 
two seasons of German opera at Drury Lane under Dr Hans Richter 
(b. 1843) in 1882 and 1884, and the production of the trilogy at 
Her Majesty's in 1882, under Angelo Neumann's managership, first 
taught stay-at-home Englishmen what Wagner really was, and an 
Italian opera as such (i.e. with Italian as the exclusive language 
employed and the old " star " system in full swing) ceased to exist 
as a regular institution a few years after that. The revival of 
public interest in the opera only took place after Mr (afterwards 
Sir) Augustus Harris (1 852-1 896) had started his series of operas 
at Drury Lane in 1887. In the following season Harris took 
Covent Garden, and since that time the opera has been restored . 
to greater public favour than it ever enjoyed, at all events since the 
days of Jenny Lind. The clever manager saw that the public 
was tired of operas arranged to suit the views of the prima donna 
and no one else, and he cast the works he produced, among which 
were Un Ballo in maschera and Les Hugugnots, with due attention 
to every part. The brothers Jean and Edouard de Reszk6, both 
of whom had appeared in London before — the former as a baritone 
and the latter during the seasons 1880-1884 — were even stronger 
attractions to the musical public of the time than the various 
leading sopranos, among whom were Mme Albani, Miss M. Mac- 
intyre, Mme Melba, Frau Sucher and Mme Nordica, during the 
earlier seasons, and Mme Eames, Mile Ravogli, MM. Lassalle and 
P. H. Plancpn, and many other Parisian favourites later. As 
time went on, the excellent custom obtained of giving each work 
in the language in which it was written, and among the distinguished 
German artists who were added to the company were Frau M. 
Ternina, Frau E. Schumann-Heink, Frau Lilli Lehmann and many 
more. Since Harris's death in 1896 the traditions started by him 
were on the whole well maintained, and as a sign of the difference 
between the present and the former position of English composers, 
it may be mentioned that two operas by F. H. Cowen, Signa and 
Harotdy and two by Stanford, The Veiled Prophet and Much Ado 
about Nothing were produced. To Signor Lago, a manager t of 



rusticana, Tschaikovsky's Eugen Onegin and other works. 

If it be just to name one institution and one man as the creator 
of such an atmosphere as allowed the genius of English composers 
to flourish, then that honour must be paid to the Crystal Palace 
and August Manns, the conductor of its Saturday concerts. At 
first engaged as sub-conductor, under a certain Schallehn, t at the 
building which was the lasting result of the Great Exhibition of 
1851, he became director of the music in 1855; so for the better 

Cart of half a century his influence was exerted on behalf of the 
est music of all schools, and especially in tavour of anything of

English growth. Through evil report and good report he supported 
his convictions, and for many years he introduced one English 
composer after another to a fame which they would have found it 
hard to gain without his help and that of Sir George Grove, : his 
loyal supporter. In 1862, when Arthur Sullivan had just returned 
from his studies in Leipzig, his Tempest music was produced at the 
Crystal Palace, and it is beyond question that it was this success 
and that of the succeeding works from the same hand which first 
showed Englishmen that music worth listening to might be pro- 
duced by an English hand. Sullivan reached the highest point of 
his achievement in The Golden Legend (1886), his most important 
contribution to the music of the renaissance. An important part 
of the Crystal Palace music was that the concerts did not follow, 
but led, popular taste; the works of Schubert, Schumann and 
many other great masters were given constantly, and the whole 
repertory of classical music was gone through, so that a constant 
attendant at these concerts would have become acquainted with 
the whole range of the best class of music. From 1859 onwards 
the classical chamber-music could be heard at the Popular Concerts 
started by Arthur Chappell, and for many years their repertory 
was not less catholic than that of the Crystal Palace undertaking; 
that in later times the habit increased to a lamentable extent of 
choosing only the ** favourite " (i.e. hackneyed) works of the great 
masters does not lessen the educational value of the older concerts. 
The lovers of the newer developments of music were always more 
fully satisfied at the concerts of the Musical Union, a body founded 
by John Ella in 1844, which lasted until 1880. From 1879 onwards 
the visits of Hans Kichter, the conductor, were a feature of the 
musical season, and the importance of his work, not only in spread- 
ing a love of Wagner's music, but in regard to every other branch 
of the best orchestral music, cannot be exaggerated. Like the 
popular concerts, the Richter concerts somewhat fell away in 
later years from their original purpose, and their managers were 
led by the popularity of certain pieces to give too little variety. 
The importance of Richter's work was in bringing forward the finest 
English music in the years when the masters of the renaissance 
were young and untried. Here were to be heard the orchestral 
works of Sir Hubert Parry, Sir Charles Villiers Stanford, Sir A. 
Campbell Mackenzie and Dr F.^H. Cowen; and the names of these 
composers were thus brought into notice much more effectually 
than could have been the case in other surroundings. Meanwhile 
outside London the work of the renaissance was being carried on, 
notably at Cambridge, where^ by the amalgamation of various 
smaller societies with the University Musical Society, Stanford 
created in 1875 a splendid institution which did much to foster a 
love of the best music for many years; and at Oxford, where private 
meetings in the rooms of Hubert Parry brought about the institu- 
tion of the Musical Club, which has borne fruit in many ways, 
though only in the direction of chamber-music. The Bach Choir, 
founded by Mr Arthur Duke Coleridge in 1875,' and conducted for 
the first ten years of its existence by Mr Otto Goldschmidt and 
subsequently by Professor Stanford, worked on purely uncommercial 
lines ever since its foundation, and besides many important works 
of Bach, it brought forward most important compositions by 
Englishmen, and had a prominent share in the work of the renais- 
sance. Parry's earlier compositions had a certain austerity in 
them which, while it commanded the homage of the cultivated few, 
prevented their obtaining wide popularity; and it was not until 
the date of his choral setting of Milton's Ode at a Solemn Mustek 
that he found his true vein. In this and its many successors, 
produced at the autumn festivals, though very rarely given in 
London, there was a nobility of utterance, a sublimity of concep- 
tion, a mastery of resource, that far surpass anything accomplished 
in England since the days of Purcell; while his " Symphonic Varia- 
tions " for orchestra, and at least two of his symphonies, exhibit 
his command of the modern modifications of classical forms in 
great perfection. Like Parry, Stanford first caught the ear of the 
public at large with a choral work, the stirring ballad-setting of 
Tennyson's Revenge; and in all his earlier and later works alike, 
which include compositions in every form, he shows himself a 
supreme master of effect; in dramatic or lyrical handling of voices, 
in orchestral^ and chamber-music, his sense of beauty is unfailing, 
and while his ideas have real distinction, his treatment of them is 
nearly always the chief interest of his works. The work of the 
musical renaissance has been more beneficially fostered by these 
two masters than by any other individuals, through the medium 
. of the Royal College of Music. In 1876 the National Training 
School of Music was opened with Sullivan as principal; he was 
succeeded by Sir John Stainer in 1881, and the circumstance that 
such artists as Mr Eugen d'Albert and Mr Frederic Cliffe received 
there the foundation of their musical education is the only important 
fact connected with the institution, which in 1882 was succeeded 
*by the Royal College of Music, under the directorship of Sir George 
Grove, and with Parry and Stanford as professors of composition. 
In 1894 Parry succeeded to the directorship, and before and after 
this date work of the best educational kind was done in all branches 
of the art, but most of all in the important branch of composition. 
Mackenzie's place amongthe masters of the renaissance is assured 
by his romantic compositions for orchestra — such as La Belle dame 
sans merci and the two " Scottish Rhapsodies "; some of his choral 



works, such as the oratorios, show some tendency to fall back into 
the conventionalities from which the renaissance movement was an 
effort to escape; but in The Cottar's Saturday Night ; The Story of 
Sayid; Veni, Creator Spiritus, and many other things, not except- 
ing the opera Colomba or the witty " Britannia " overture, he shows 
no lack of spontaneity or power. As principal of the Royal Academy 
of Music (he succeeded Macfarren in 1888) he revived the former 
glories of the school, and the excellent plan by which it and the Royal 
College unite their forces in the examinations of the Associated 
Board is largely due to his initiative. The opera just mentioned 
was the first of the modern series of English operas brought out 
from 1883 onwards by the Carl Rosa company during its tenure 
of Drury Lane Theatre: at the time it seemed as though English 
opera had a chance of getting permanently established, but the 
enterprise, being a purely private and individual one, failed to have 
a lasting effect upon the art of the country, and after the production 
of two operas by Mackenzie, two by Arthur Goring Thomas, one 
by F. Corder, two by Cowen and one by Stanford, the artistic 
work of the company grew gradually less and less important. In 
spite of the strong influence of French ideals and methods, the music 
of Arthur Goring Thomas was remarkable for individuality and 
charm; in any other country his beautiful opera Esmeralda would 
have formed part of the regular repertory; and his orchestral 
suites, cantatas and a multitude of graceful and original songs, 
remain as evidence that if his career had been prolonged, the art 
of England might have been enriched by some masterpiece it would 
not willingly nave let die. After a youth of extraordinary pre- 
cocity, and a number of variously successful attempts in the more 
ambitious and more serious branchesof the art, Cowen found his 
chief success in the treatment of fanciful or fairy subjects, whether 
jn cantatas or orchestral works; here he is without a rival, and his 
ideas are uniformly graceful, excellently treated and wonderfully 
effective. His second tenure of the post of conductor of the Phil- 
harmonic Society showed him to be a highly accomplished conductor. 

In regard to English opera two more undertakings deserve to be 
recorded. In 1891 the Royal English Opera House was opened 
with Sullivan's Ivanhoe, a work written especially for the occasion; 
the absence of anything like a repertory, and the retention of this 
one work in the bills For a period far longer than its attractions 
could warrant, brought the inevitable result, and shortly after the 
production of a charming French comic opera the theatre was 
turned intothe Palace Mush: Hall. The charming and thoroughly 
characteristic Shamus O'Brien of Stanford was successfully pro- 
duced in 1896 at the Op£ra Comique theatre. This work brought 
into public prominence the conductor Mr Henry J. Wood (b. 1870), 
who exercised a powerful influence on the art of the country by 
means of his orchestra, which was constantly to be heard at the 
Queen's Hall, and which attained, by continual performance 
together, a degree of perfection before unknown in England. It 
achieved an important work in bringing music within the reach of 
all classes at the Promenade Concerts given through each summer, 
as well as by means of the Symphony Concerts at other seasons. 

The movement thus started by Mr Wood increased and spread 
remarkably in later years. His training of the Queen's Hall 
Orchestra was characterized by a thoroughness and severity pre- 
viously unknown in English orchestras. This was partly made 
possible by the admirable business organization which fostered 
the movement in its earlier years; so many concerts were guaranteed 
that it was possible to give the players engagements which included 
a large amount of rehearsing. The result was soon apparent, not 
only in the raising of the standard of orchestral playing, but also 
in the higher and more intelligent standard of criticism to which 
performances were subjected both by experts and by the general 
public. The public taste in London for symphonic music grew so 
rapidly as to encourage the establishment of other bodies of players, 
until in 1910 there were five first-class professional orchestras 
giving concerts regularly in London — the Philharmonic Society, 
the Queen's Hall Orchestra, the London Symphony Orchestra 
(described by Dr Hans Richter as " the finest orchestra in the 
world "), the New Symphony Orchestra under Mr Landon Ronald 
(b. 1873), a composer and conductor of striking ability, and Mr 
Thomas Beecham s Orchestra. Mr Beecham, who had come rapidly 
to the front as a musical enthusiast and conductor, paid special 
attention to the work of British composers. Manchester, Birming- 
ham, Liverpool and Edinburgh, had their own orchestras ; and it 
might be said that the whole of the United Kingdom was now 
permeated with a taste for and a knowledge of orchestral music. 
The effect of this development has influenced the whole of the musical 
life of England. The symphony and the symphonic poem have 
taken the place so long held by the oratorio in popular taste ; and 
English composers of any merit or ability find it possible to get 
a hearing for orchestral work which at the end of the 19th century 
would have had to remain unperformed and unheard. The result 
has been the rapid development of a school of English orchestral 
composers- 1 -^ school of considerable achievement and still greater 
promise. 

The new school of English writers contains many names of 
skilled composers. Sir Edward Elgar established his reputation 
by his vigorous Caractacus and the grandiose imaginings of his 
Dream of Gerontius, as by orchestral and chamber compositions of

decided merit and individuality, and by being the composer of a 
symphony which attained greater and wider fame than any similar 
work since the symphonies of Tschaikovsky. Mr Edward German 
(b. 1862) won great success as a writer of incidental music for plays, 
and in' various lighter forms of music, for which his^ great skill in 
orchestration and his knowledge of effect stand him in good stead. 
The quality of Mr Frederic Cliffe's orchestral works is extremely 
high. Dr Arthur Somervell (b. 1863), who succeeded^ Stainer as 
musical adviser to the Board of Education, first came into promi- 
nence as a composer of a number of charming songs, notably a 
fine song-cycle from Tennyson's Maud, but his Mass and various 
orchestral works and cantatas and pianoforte pieces show his 
conspicuous ability in other forms. Various compositions written 
by Mr Hamish MacCunn (b. 1868), while still a student at the 
Royal College of Music, were received with acclamation; but his 
later work was not of equal value, though his operas Jeanie 
Deans and Diarmid were successful. Mr Granville Bantock 
(b. 1868), an ardent supporter of the most advanced music, has 
written many fine things for orchestra, and Mr William Wallace 
(b. 1861), in various orchestral pieces played at the Crystal Palace 
and elsewhere, and in such things as his " Freebooter ' songs, has 
shown strong individuality and imagination. Mr Arthur Hinton 
(b. 1869) has oroduced things of fanciful beauty and quaint origi- 
nality. Miss Ethel M. Smyth, whose Mass was given at the Royal 
Albert Hall in most favourable conditions, had her opera Fantasio 
produced at Weimar and Carlsruhe, and Der Wald at Coven t 
Garden. Miss Maud Valerie White's graceful and expressive songs 
brought her compositions into wide popularity; and Mme Liza 
Lehmann made a new reputation by her cycles of songs after 
her retirement from the profession of a singer. The first part of 
Mr S. Coleridge-Taylor's (b. 1875) Hiawatha scenes was performed 
while he was still a student at the Royal College, and so great was 
its popularity that the third part of the trilogy was commissioned 
for performance by the Royal Choral Society. Mr Cyril Scott is 
a composer who aims high, though with a somewhat strained 
originality. Dr H. Walford Da vies (b. 1869) and W. Y. Hurlstone 
(1876^1906) excel in the serious kind of chamber-music and use the 
classic forms with notable skill; and Mr R. Vaughan Williams, in 
his songs and other works, has shown perhaps the most conspicuous 
talent among all of the younger school. 

English executive musicians have never suffered from foreign 
competition in the same degree as English composers, and the 
success of such singers as Miss Anna Williams, Miss Macintyre, 
Miss Marie Brema, Miss Clara Butt, Miss Agnes Nicholls, Messrs 
Santley, Edward Lloyd, Ben Davies, Plunket Greene and Ffrangcon 
Davies; or of such pianists as Miss Fanny Daviesand Mr Leonard 
Borwick, is but a continuance of the tradition of British excellence. 

The scientific study of the music of the past has more and more 
decidedly taken its place as a branch of musical education; the 
learned writings of VV. S. Rockstro (1823-1895), many of them 
made public first in the Encyclopaedia Britannica and Grove's 
Dictionary of Music f made the subject clear to many who had been 
groping in the dark before; and the actual performance of old 
music Jhas been undertaken not only by the Bach Choir, but by the 
Magpie Madrigal Society under Mr Lionel Benson's able direction. 
In vocal and instrumental music alike the musical side of the Inter- 
national Exhibition of 1885 did excellent work in its historical 
concerts; and in that branch of archaeology which is concerned 
with the structure and restoration of old musical instruments, 
important work has been done by Mr A. J. Hipkins (1826-1903; 
so long connected with the firm of Broadwood), the Rev. F. W. 
Galpin. Arnold Dolmetsch and others. The formation of the 
Folk-Song Society in 1899 drew attention to the importance and 
extent of English traditional music, and did much to popularize 
it with singers of the present day.

MUSICAL-BOX, an instrument for producing by mechanical 
means tunes or pieces of music. The modern musical-box is 
an elaboration of the elegant toy musical snuff-box in vogue 
during the 18th century. The notes or musical sounds are pro- 
duced by the vibration of steel teeth or springs cut in a comb or 
flat plate of steel, reinforced by the harmonics generated in the 
solid steel back of the comb. The teeth are graduated in length 
from end to end of the comb or plate, the longer teeth giving the 
deeper notes; and the individual teeth are accurately attuned, 
where necessary, by filing or loading with lead. Each tone and 
semitone in the scale is represented by three or four separate 
teeth in the comb, to permit of successive repetitions of the same 
note when required by the music. The teeth are acted upon and 
musical vibrations produced by the revolution of a brass cylinder 
studded with projecting pins, which, as they move round, raise 
and release the proper teeth at due intervals according to the 
nature of the music. A single revolution of the cylinder com- 
pletes the performance of each of the several pieces of music for 
which the apparatus is set, but upon the same cylinder there may 
be inserted pins for performing as many as thirty-six separate 
airs. This is accomplished by making both the points of the 
teeth and the projecting pins which raise them very fine, so that 
a very small change in the position of the cylinder is sufficient 
to bring an entirely distinct set of pins in contact with the teeth. 
In the more elaborate musical-boxes the cylinders are removable, 
and may be replaced by others containing distinct sets of music. 
In these also there are combinations of bell, drum, cymbal and 
triangle effects, &c. The revolving motion of the cylinder is 
effected by a spring and clock-work which on some modern instru- 
ments will work continuously for an hour and a half without 
winding, and the rate of revolution is regulated by a fly regulator. 
The headquarters of the musical-box trade is Geneva, where the 
manufacture gives employment to thousands of persons. 

The musical-box is a type of numerous instruments for producing 
musical effects by mechanical means, in all of which a revolving 
cylinder or barrel studded with pins is the governing feature. The 
position of the pins on the barrel is determined by two considera- 
tions: those of pitch and of time or rhythm. The degrees of 
pitch or semitones of the scales are in the direction of the length 
of the cylinder, while those of time, or the beats in the bars, arein 
the path of the revolution of the cylinder. The action of the pins 
is practically the same for all barrel instruments; each pin serves to 
raise some part of the mechanism for one note at the exact moment 
and for the exact duration of time required by the music to be 
played, after which, passing along with the revolution of the 
cylinder, it ceases to act.. The principle of the barrel operating 
by friction , t by percussion or by wind on reeds, pipes or strings 
governs carillons or musical bells, barrel organs, mechanical flutes, 
celestial voices, harmoniphones, violin-pianos and the orchestrions 
and polyphons in which a combination of all orchestral effects is 
attempted. In the case of wind instruments, such as flutes, 
trumpets, oboes, clarinets, imitated in the more complex orches- 
trions, the pins raise levers which open the valves admitting^ air, 
compressed by mechanical bellows, to various kinds of flue-pipes, 
and to others fitted with beating and free reeds. The sticks used 
for striking bells, drums, cymbals and triangles are set in motion 
in a similar manner. A fine set of full-page drawings, published at 
Frankfort in 1615, 1 makes the whole working of the pinned barrel 
quite clear, and establishes the exact relation of the pins to the 
music produced by the barrel so unmistakably that some bars of 
the piece of music set on the cylinder can be made out. The 
prototype of the 19th-century musical-box is to be found in the 
Netherlands where during the 15th century the dukes of Burgundy 
encouraged the invention of ingenious mechanical musical 
-curiosities such as " organs which played of themselves/* musical 
snuff-boxes, singing birds, curious clocks, &c. A principle of more 
recent introduction than the studded cylinder consists of sheets 
of perforated paper or card, somewhat similar to the Jacquard 
apparatus for weaving. The perforations correspond in position 
and length to the pitch and duration of the note they represent, 

1 See S. de Caus, Les forces mouvantes; and article Barrel Organ. 



and as the web or long sheet of paper passes over the instrument 
the perforated holes are brought in proper position and sequence 
under the influence of the suction or pressure cf air from a bellows, 
and thereby the notes are either directly acted on, as in the case of 
reed instruments, or the opening and closing of valves set in motion 
levers or liberate springs which govern special notes. The United 
States are the original home of the instruments controlled by 
perforated paper known as orguinettes, organinas, melodeons, &c. 
All these instruments are being gradually replaced in popular 
favour by the piano-players and the gramophone* (K. S.) 

MUSICAL NOTATION, a pictorial method of representing 
sounds to the ear through the medium of the eye. It is probable 
that the earliest attempts at notation were made by the Hindus 
and Chinese, from whom the legacy was transferred to Greece. 
The exact nature of the Greek notation is a subject of dispute, 
different explanations assigning 1680, 1620, 900, or 138 signals 
to their alphabetical method of delineation. To Boethius we 
owe the certainty that the Greek notation was not adopted by 
the Latins, although it is not certain whether he was the first 
to apply the fifteen letters of the Roman alphabet to the scale 
of sounds included within the two octaves, or whether he was 
only the first to make record of that application. The reduction 
of the scale to the octave is ascribed to St Gregory, as also the 
naming of the seven notes, but it is not safe to assume that such 
an ascription is accurate or final. Indications of a scheme of 
notation based, not on the alphabet, but on the use of dashes, 
hooks, curves, dots and strokes are found to exist as early as 
the 6th century, while specimens in illustration of this different 
method do not appear until the 8th. The origin of these signs, 
known as neumes (vevpara., or nods), is the full stop (punctus), 
the comma (virga) } and the mound or undulating line (clivus), 
the first indicating a short sound, the second a long sound, and 
the third a group of two notes. The musical intervals were 
suggested by the distance of these signals from the words of the 
text. The variety of neumes employed at different times, and 
the fluctuations due to handwriting, have made them extremely 
difficult to decipher. In the 10th century a marked advance 
is shown by the use of a red line traced horizontally . above the 
text to give the singer a fixed note (F=fa), thus helping him to 
approximate the intervals. To this was added a second line in 
yellow (for C = ut), and finally a staff arose from the further 
addition of two black lines over these. The difficulty of the 
subject is complicated for the student by the fact that an 
incredible variety of notations coexisted at one period, all more 
or less representing attempts in the direction of the modern 
system. A variety of experiments resulted in the assignment 
of the four-lined staff to sacred music and of the five-lined staff 
to secular music. The yellow and red colours were replaced 
by the use of the letters F and C (fa and ut) on the lines. This 
use of letters to indicate clef is forestalled in a manuscript of 
Guido of Arezzo's Micrologus } dating from the 12th century, in 
which is the famous hymn to St John, printed with neumes on 
a staff of three lines (see Guido of Arezzo). The use of letters 
for indicating clefs has survived to the present day, our clef 
signatures being modified forms of the letters C, F and G, which 
have passed through a multitude of shapes. Before the 12th 
century there is no trace of a measured notation (i.e. of a 
numerical time division separating the component parts of a 
piece of music). It is at the time of Franco of Cologne 2 that 
measured music takes its rise, together with the black notation 
in place of neumes, which disappeared altogether by the end of 
the 14th century. Writing four hundred years after St Gregory, 
Cottonius complains bitterly of the defects in the system of 
neumes: "The same marks which Master Trudo sang as 
thirds, were sung as fourths by Master Albinus; while Master 
Salomo asserts that fifths are the notes meant, so at last there 
were as many methods of singing as teachers of the art." Pos- 
sibly the reckless multiplication of lines in the staff may have 
contributed to the obscurity of which Cottonius complains. 
In the black notation, which led to the modern system, the 
square note with a tail fl) is the long sound; the square note 

*The principles of Franco are found in the treatises of Walter 
Odington, a monk of Evesham who became archbishop of Canterbury 
in 1228.

without a tail («) is the breve; and the lozenge shape (I) is the 
semibreve. In a later development there were added the double 
longhand the minum (V). The breve, according to Franco of 
Cologne, was the unit of measure. The development of a fixed 
time division was further continued by Philippe de Vitry. It 
has been noted with well-founded astonishment that at this time 
the double time (i.e. two to the bar) was unknown, in spite of 
this being the time used in marching and also illustrated in the 
process of breathing. Triple time (i.e. three to the bar) was 
regarded as the most perfect because it was indivisible. It was 
as if there lay some mysterious enchantment in a number that 
could not be divided into equal portions without the fraction. 
" Triple time, " says Jean de Muris, " is called perfect, according 
to Franco, a man of much skill in his art, because it hath its name 
from the Blessed Trinity which is pure and true perfection." 
Vitry championed the rights of imperfect time and invented 
signs to distinguish the two. The perfect circle O represented 
the perfect or triple time; the half circle C the imperfect or 
double-time. This C has survived in modern notation to 
indicate four-time, which is twice double-time; when crossed (£ 
it means double-time. The method of dividing into perfect 
and imperfect was described as prolation. The addition of a 
point to the circle or semi-circle (0 Q ) indicated major pro- 
lation ; its absence , minor prolation. The substitution of 
white for black notation began with the first year of the 14th 
century and was fully established in the 15th century. 

It has already been shown how the earlier form of alphabetical 
notation was gradually superseded by one based on the attempt 
to represent the relative height and depth of sounds pictorially. 
The alphabetical nomenclature, however, became inextricably 
associated with the pictorial system. The two conceptions 
reinforced each other; and from the hexachordal scale, endowed 
with the solmization of ut, re, mi, fa, sol, la — which was a 
device for identifying notes by their names when talked of, 
rather than by their positions when seen on a page of music — 
arose the use of what are now known as accidentals. Of these 
it may here be said that the flat originated from the necessity 
of sinking the B of the scale in order to form a hexachord on 
the note F in such a way as to cause the semitone to fall in the 
right place — which in the case of all hexachords was between 
the third and fourth notes. This softened B was written in a 
rounded form thus: b (rolundum), while the original B remained 
square thus: [3 (quadrum). The original conception of the sharp 
was to cross or lattice the square B, by which it was shown that 
it was neither to be softened nor to remain unchanged. The 
flat, which originated in the 10th century, appears to have been 
of far earlier date than the sharp, the invention of which has 
been ascribed to Josquin Des Pre*s (1450-1521). The B-sharp 
was called B cancellatum, the cross being formed thus j%. The 
use of key signatures constructed out of these signs of sharp and 
flat was of comparatively late introduction. The key signature 
states at the beginning of a piece of music the sharps and flats 
which it contains within the scale in which it is written. It is a 
device to avoid repeating the sign of sharp and flat with every 
fresh occasion of their occurring. The exact distinction between 
what were accidental sharps or flats, and what were sharps or 
flats in the key, was still undetermined in the time of Handel, 
who wrote the Suite in E containing the " Harmonious Black- 
smith " with three sharps instead of four. The double bb (some- 
times written b or /3) and the double sharp - X (sometimes 
(Written J^, "^ or $$ ) are Conventions of a much later. date, 
called into existence by the demands of modern music,- while 
the sign of natural (hj) is the outcome of the original B quadra- 
tion or square B \y 

The systems known as Tonic Sol Fa and the Galin-Paris- 
Cheve methods do not belong to the subject of notation, as they 
are ingenious mechanical substitutes for the experimentally devel- 
oped systems analysed above. The basis of these substitutes 
is the reference of all notes to key relationship and not to pitch.

MUSIC HALLS. The "variety theatre" or "music-hall" 
of to-day developed out of the " saloon theatres " which existed 
in London about 1 830-1840; they owed their form and existence 
to the restrictive action of the " patent " theatres at that time. 
These theatres had the exclusive right of representing what was 
broadly .called the " legitimate drama," which ranged from 
Shakespeare to Monk Lewis, and from Sheridan and Goldsmith 
to Kotzebue and Alderman Birch of Cornhill, citizen and poet, 
and the founder of the turtle-soup trade. The patent houses 
defended their rights when they were attacked by the " minor " 
and " saloon " theatres, but they often acted in the spirit of 
the dog in the manger. While they pursued up to fine and 
even imprisonment the poachers on their dramatic preserves, 
they too often neglected the " legitimate drama " for the 
supposed meretricious attractions offered by their illegitimate 
competitors. The British theatre gravitated naturally to the 
inn or tavern. The tavern was the source of life and heat, and 
warmed all social gatherings. The inn galleries offered rather 
rough stages, before the Shakespeare and Alleyn playhouses 
were built. The inn yards were often made as comfortable as 
possible for the " groundlings " by layers of straw, but the tavern 
character of the auditorium was never concealed. Excisable 
liquor was always obtainable, and the superior members of the 
audience, who chose to pay for seats at the side of the stage or 
platform (like the " avant-scene " boxes at a Parisian theatre), 
were allowed to smoke Raleigh's Virginian weed, then a novel 
luxury. This was, of course, the first germ of a " smoking- 
theatre." 

While the drama progressed as a recognized public entertain- 
ment in England, and was provided with its own buildings in the 
town, or certain booths at the fairs, the Crown exercised its 
patronage in favour of certain individuals, giving them power 
to set up playhouses at any time in any parts of London and 
Westminster. The first and most important grant was made by 
Charles II. to his " trusty and well-beloved " Thomas Killigrew 
" and Sir William Davenant." This was a personal grant, not 
connected with any particular sites or buildings, and is known 
in theatrical history as the " Killigrew and Davenant patent." 
Killigrew was the author of several unsuccessful plays, and Sir 
William Davenant, said to be an illegitimate child of William 
Shakespeare, was a stage manager of great daring and genius. 
Charles II. had strong theatrical leanings, and had helped to 
arrange the court ballets at Versailles for Louis XIV. The 
Killigrew and Davenant patent in course of time descended, 
after a fashion, to the Theatres Royal, Co vent Garden and Drury 
Lane, and was and still is the chief legal authority governing 
these theatres. The " minor " and outlying playhouses were 
carried on under the Music and Dancing Act of George II., and 
the annual licences were granted by the local magistrates. 

The theatre proper having emancipated itself from the inn or 
tavern, it was now the turn of the inn or tavern to develop into 
an independent place of amusement, and to lay the foundation 
of that enormous middle-class and lower middle-class institution 
of interest which we agree to term the music hall. It rose from 
the most modest, humble and obscure beginning — from the 
public-house bar-parlour, and its weekly " sing-songs," chiefly 
supported by voluntary talent from the "harmonic meetings" 
of the " long-room " upstairs, generally used as a Foresters' or 
Masonic club-room, where one or two professional singers were 
engaged and a regular chairman was appointed, to the " assem- 
bly-room " entertainments at certain hotels, where private balls 
and school festivals formed part of an irregular series. The 
district " tea-garden," which was then an agreeable feature of 
suburban life — the suburbs being next door to the city and the 
country next door to the suburbs — was the first to show dramatic

ambition, and to erect in some portion of its limited but leafy 
grounds a lath-and-plaster stage large enough for about eight 
people to move upon without incurring the danger of falling 
off into the adjoining fish pond and fountain. A few classical 
statues in plaster, always slightly mutilated, gave an educational 
tone to the place, and with a few coloured oil-lamps hung amongst 
the bushes the proprietor felt he had gone as near the " Royal 
Vauxhall Gardens " as possible for the small charge of a sixpenny 
refreshment ticket. There were degrees of quality, of course, 
amongst these places, which answered to the German beer- 
gardens, though with inferior music. The Beulah Spa at 
Norwood, the White Conduit House at Pentonville, the York- 
shire Stingo in the Marylebone Road, the Monster at Pimlico, 
the St Helena at Rotherhithe, the Globe at Mile End* the Red 
Cow at Dalston, the Highbury Barn at Highbury, the Manor 
House at Mare Street, Hackney, the Rosemary Branch at 
Hoxton, and other rus-in-urbe retreats, were up to the level of 
their time, if rarely beyond it. 

The suspended animation of the law — the one Georgian act, 
which was mainly passed to check the singing of Jacobite songs 
in the tap-rooms and tea-gardens of the little London of 1730, 
when the whole population of the United Kingdom was only 
about six millions — encouraged the growth eventually of a 
number of " saloon theatres " in various London districts, 
which were allowed under the head of "Music and Dancing" 
to go as far on the light dramatic road as the patent theatres 
thought proper to permit. The 25 Geo. II. c. 36, which in later 
days was still the only act under which the music halls of forty 
millions and more of people were licensed, was always liberally 
interpreted, as long as it kept clear of politics. 

The " saloon theatres," always being taverns or attached to 
taverns, created a public who liked to mix its dramatic amuse- 
ments with smoking and light refreshments. The principal 
" saloons " were the Effingham in the Whitechapel Road, the 
Bower in the Lower Marsh, Lambeth, the Albert at Islington, 
the Britannia at Hoxton, the Grecian in the City Road, the 
Union in Shoreditch, the Stingo at Paddington and several 
others of less importance. All these places had good com- 
panies, especially in the winter, and many of* them nourished 
leading actors of exceptional merit. The dramas were chiefly 
rough adaptations from the contemporary French stage, 
occasionally flying as high as Alexandre Dumas the elder and 
Victor Hugo. Actors of real tragic power lived, worked and 
died in this confined area. Some went to America, and acquired 
fame and fortune; and among others, Frederick Robson, who 
was trained at the Grecian, first when it was the leading 
saloon theatre and afterwards when it became the leading music 
hall (a distinction with little difference), fought his way to the 
front after the abolition of the " patent rights " and was accepted 
as the greatest tragi-comic actor of his time. The Grecian 
saloon theatre, better known perhaps, with its pleasure garden 
or yard, as the Eagle Tavern, City Road, which formed the 
material of one of Charles Dickens's SketcJies by Boz t was a place 
managed with much taste, enterprise and discretion by its pro- 
prietor, Mr Rouse. It was the " saloon " where the one and only 
attempt, with limited means, was ever made to import almost 
all the original repertory of the Op6ra Comique in Paris, with the 
result that many musical works were presented to a sixpenny 
audience that had never been heard before nor since in England. 
Auber, Herold, Adolphe Adam, Boieldieu, Gretry, Donizetti, 
Bellini, Rossini and a host of others gave some sort of advanced 
musical education, through the Grecian, to a rather depressing 
part of London, long before board schools were established. 
The saloon theatres rarely offended the patent houses, and when 
they did the law was soon put in motion to show that Shake- 
speare could not be represented with impunity. The Union 
Saloon in Shoreditch, then under the direction of Mr Samuel' 
Lane, who afterwards, with his wife, Mrs Sara Lane, at the 
Britannia Saloon, became the leading local theatrical manager 
of his day, was tempted in 1834 to give a performance of Othello. 
It was " raided " by the then rather " new police," and all the 
actors, servants, audience, directors and musicians were taken 



into custody and marched off to Worship Street police station, 
confined for the remainder of the night, and fined and warned 
in the morning. 'The same and only law still exists for those 
who are helping to keep a " disorderly house," but there are no 
holders of exclusive dramatic patent rights to set it in motion. 
The abolition of this privileged monopoly was effected about this 
time by a combination of distinguished literary men and drama- 
tists, who were convinced, from observation and experience, that 
the patent theatres had failed to nurse the higher drama, while 
interfering with the beneficial freedom of public amusements. 

The effect of Covent Garden and Drury Lane on the art of 
acting had resulted chiefly in limiting the market for theatrical 
employment, with a consequent all-round reduction of salaries. 
They kept the Lyceum Theatre (or English Opera House) for 
years in the position of a music hall, giving sometimes two 
performances a night, like a " gaff " in the New Cut or White- 
chapel. They had not destroyed the " star " system, 'and 
Edmund Kean and the boy Betty — the " Infant Roscius " — 
were able to command sensational rewards. In the end Charles 
Dickens, Sir Edward Bulwer-Lytton, Sir Thomas Noon Talfourd 
and others got the patents abolished, and the first step towards 
free trade in the drama was secured. 

The effect of this change was to draw attention to the " saloon 
theatres," where during the performances smoking, drinking, 
and even eating were allowed in the auditorium. An act was 
soon passed, known as the Theatres Act (1843), appointing a 
censor of stage-plays, and placing the London theatres under 
the control of a Crown officer, changing with ministries. This 
was the lord chamberlain for the time being. The lord chamber- 
lain of this period drew a hard-and-fast line between theatres 
under his control, where no smoking and drinking were allowed 
" in front," and theatres or halls where the old habits and customs 
of the audience were not to be interfered with. These latter 
were to go under the jurisdiction of the local magistrates, 
or other licensing authorities, under the 25 Geo. II. c. 36 — the 
Music and Dancing Act — and so far a divorce was decreed 
between the taverns and the playhouses. The lord chamberlain 
eventually made certain concessions. Refreshment bars were 
allowed at the lord chamberlain's theatres in unobstrusive 
positions, victualled under a special act of William IV., and 
private smoking-rooms were allowed at most theatres on appli- 
cation. All this implied that stage plays were to be kept free 
from open smoking and drinking, and miscellaneous entertain- 
ments were to enjoy their old social freedom. The position was 
accepted by those " saloon theatres " which were not tempted 
to become lord chamberlain houses, and the others, with many 
additions, started the first music halls. 

Amongst the first of these halls, and certainly the very first 
as far as intelligent management was concerned, was the Can- 
terbury in the Lower Marsh, Lambeth, which was next door 
to the old Bower Saloon, then transformed into a " minor 
theatre." The Canterbury sprang from the usual tavern 
germ, its creator being Mr. Charles Morton, who honourably 
earned the name of the " doyen of the music halls." It justified 
its title by cultivating the best class of music, and exposed the 
prejudice and unfairness of Planch6's sarcasm in a Haymarket 
burlesque — " most music hall — most melancholy." Mr Charles 
Morton added pictorial art to his other attractions, and obtained 
the support of Punch, which stamped the Canterbury as the 
" Royal Academy over the water." At this time by a mere 
accident Gounod's great opera of Faust, through defective inter- 
national registration, fell into the public domain in England and 
became common property. The Canterbury, not daring 
to present it with scenery, costumes and action, for fear of the 
Stage-play Act, gave what was called " An Operatic Selection," 
the singers standing in plain dresses in a row, like pupils at a 
school examination or a chorus in an oratorio at Exeter Hall. 
The music was well' rendered by a thoroughly competent com- 
pany, night after night, for a long period, so that by the time 
the opera attracted the tardy attention of the two principal 
opera managers at Her Majesty's Theatre in the Haymarket 
and Covent Garden Theatre, the tunes most popular were being* 



MUSIC HALLS

whistled by the " man in the street," the " boy in the gutter " 
and the tradesman waiting at the door for orders. 

With the Canterbury Hall, and its brother the Oxford 
in Oxford Street — a converted inn and coaching yard — built 
and managed on the same lines by Mr Charles Morton, the 
music halls were well started. They had imitators in every 
direction — some large, some small, and some with architectural 
pretensions, but all anxious to attract the public by cheap 
prices and physical comforts not attainable at any of the 
regular theatres. 

With the growth and improvement of these " Halls," the few 
old cellar " singing-rooms " gradually disappeared. Evans's 
in Covent Garden was the last to go. Rhodes's, or the 
Cyder Cellars in Maiden Lane, at the back of the Adelphi 
Theatre; the Coal Hole, in the Strand, which now forms 
the site of Terry's Theatre; the Doctor Johnson, in Fleet 
Street (oddly enough, within the precincts of the City of London) 
disappeared one by one, and with them the compound material 
for Thackeray's picture of "The Cave of Harmony." This 
" Cave," like Dickens's " Old Curiosity Shop," was drawn 
from the features of many places. To do the " cellars " a little 
justice, they represented the manners of a past time — heavy 
suppers and heavy drinks, and the freedom of their songs and 
recitations was partly due to the fact that the audience and 
the actors were always composed of men. Thackeray clung 
to Evans's to the last. It was his nightly " chapel of 
ease " to the adjoining Garrick Club. In its old age it became 
decent, and ladies were admitted to a private gallery, behind 
screens and a convent grille. Before its death, and its revival 
in another form as a sporting club, it admitted ladies both on 
and off the stage, and became an ordinary music hall. 

The rise and progress of the London music halls naturally 
excited a good deal of attention and jealousy on the part of 
the regular theatres, and this was increased when the first 
Great Variety Theatre was opened in Leicester Square. 
The building was the finest example of Moorish architec- 
ture on a large scale ever erected in England. It was burnt 
down in the 'eighties, and the present theatre was built in 
its place. Originally it was " The Panopticon," a palace of 
" recreative science," started under the most distinguished 
direction on the old polytechnic institution lines, and with 
ample capital. It was a commercial failure, and after being 
tried as an " American Circus," it was turned into a great 
variety theatre, the greatest of its kind in Europe, under the 
name of the Alhambra Palace. Its founder was Mr E.T. Smith, 
the energetic theatrical manager, and its developer was Mr 
Frederick Strange, who came full of spirit and money from 
the Crystal Palace. He produced in 1865 an ambitious ballet — 
the Dagger Ballet from Auber's Enfant prodigue, which had 
been seen at Drury Lane Theatre in 185 1, translated as " Azael." 

The Alhambra was prosecuted in the superior courts for 
infringing the Stage-play Act — the 6 & 7 Vict. c. 68. The 
case is in the law reports — Wigan v. Strange; the ostensible 
plaintiffs being the well-known actors and managers Horace 
Wigan and Benjamin Webster, supported by J. B. Buckstone, 
and many other theatrical managers. A long trial before 
eminent judges, with eminent counsel on both sides, produced 
a decision which was not very satisfactory, and far from final. 
It held that, as far as the entertainment went, according to 
the evidence tendered, it was not a ballet representing any 
distinct story or coherent action, but it might have been a 
" divertissement " — a term suggested in the course of the 
trial. A short time after this a pantomime scene was pro- 
duced at the same theatre, called Where's the Police? 
which had a clown, a pantaloon, a columbine and a harlequin, 
with other familiar characters, a mob, a street and even the 
traditional red-hot poker. This inspired proceedings by the 
same plaintiffs before a police magistrate at Marlborough Street, 
who inflicted the full penalties — £20 a performance for 12 
performances, and costs. An appeal was made to the West- 
minster quarter sessions, supported by Serjeant Ballantine 
and opposed by Mr Hardinge Giffard (afterwards Lord Chan- 



cellor Halsbury), and the conviction was confirmed. Being 
heard at quarter sessions, there is no record in the law reports. 

These and other prosecutions suggested the institution of 
a parliamentary inquiry, and a House of Commons select 
committee was appointed in 1866, at the instigation of the 
music halls and variety theatres. The committee devoted 
much time to the inquiry, and examined many witnesses — 
amongst the rest Lord Sydney, the lord chamberlain, who 
had no personal objection to undertake the control of these 
comparatively young places of amusement and recreation. 
Much of the evidence was directed against the Stage-play Act, 
as the difficulty appeared to be' to define what was notz. stage 
play. Lord Denman, Mr Justice Byles, and other eminent 
judges seemed to think that any song, action or recitation 
that excited the emotions might be pinned as a stage-play, 
and that the old definition — " the representation of any action 
by a person (or persons) acting, and not in the form of narration " 
— could be supported in the then state of the law in any of 
the higher courts. The variety theatres on this occasion were 
encouraged by what had just occurred at the time in France. 
Napoleon III., acting under the advice of M. Michel Chevalier, 
passed a decree known as La Liberty des theatres, which 
fixed the status of the Parisian and other music halls. Operettas, 
ballets of action, ballets, vaudevilles, pantomimes and all light 
pieces were allowed, and the managers were no longer legally 
confined to songs and acrobatic performances. The report 
of the select committee of 1866, signed by the chairman, Mr 
(afterwards Viscount) Goschen, was in favour of granting the 
variety theatres and music halls the privileges they asked for, 
which were those enjoyed in France and other countries. 

Parliamentary interference and the introduction of several 
private bills in the House of Commons, which came to nothing, 
checked, if they did not altogether stop, the prosecutions. The 
variety theatres advanced in every direction in number and im- 
portance. Ballets grew in splendour and coherency.* The lighting 
and ventilation, the comfort and decoration of the various 
" palaces " (as many of them were now called) improved, 
and the public, as usual, were the gainers. Population in- 
creased, and the six millions of 1730 became forty millions 
and more. The same and only act (25 Geo. II. c. 36), adequate 
or inadequate, still remained. London is defined as' the 
" administrative county of London," and its area — the 
20-miles radius — is mapped out. The Metropolitan Board 
of Works retired or was discharged, and the London County 
Council was created and has taken its place. The London 
County Council, with extended power over structures and 
structural alterations, acquired the licensing of variety theatres 
and music halls from the local magistrates (the Middlesex, 
Surrey, Tower Hamlets and other magistrates) within 
the administrative county of London. The L. C. C. examine 
and enforce their powers. They have been advised that 
they can separate a music from a dancing licence if they like, 
and that when they grant the united licence the dancing 
means the dancing of paid performers on a stage, and not the 
dancing of the audience on a platform or floor, as at the short- 
lived but elegant Cremorne Gardens, or an old-time " Casino." 
They are also advised that they can withhold licences, unless 
the applicants agree not to apply for a drink licence to the local 
magistrates sitting in brews ter sessions, who still retain their 
control over the liquor trade. Theatre licences are often with- 
held unless a similar promise is made — the drink authority in 
this case being the Excise, empowered by the Act of William IV. 
(5 & 6 Will. IV. c. 39, s. 7). 

The spread of so-called " sketches " — a kind of condensed 
drama or farce — in the variety theatres, and the action of the 
London County Council in trying to check the extension of 
refreshment licences to these establishments, with other grounds 
of discontent on the part of managers (individuals or " limited 
companies "), led to the appointment of a second select com- 
mittee of the House of Commons in 1892 and the production 
of another blue-book. The same ground was gone over, and 
the same objections were raised against a licensing authority

which is elected by public votes, only exists for three years 
before another election is due, and can give no guarantee for 
the continuity of its judgments. The consensus of opinion 
(as in 1866) was in favour of a state official, responsible to 
parliament — like the Home Office or the Board of Trade — the 
preference being given to the lord chamberlain and his staff, 
who know much about theatres and theatrical business. The 
chairman of the committee was the Hon. David Plunkett (after- 
wards Lord Rathmore), and the report in spirit was the same 
as the one of 1866. Three forms of licence were suggested: 
one for theatres proper, one for music halls, and one for concert 
rooms. 

Though the rise and progress of the music hall and variety 
theatre interest is one of the most extraordinary facts of the 
last half of the 19th century, the business has little or no 
corporate organization, and there is nothing like a complete 
registration of the various properties throughout the United 
Kingdom. In London the " London Entertainments Pro- 
tection Association," which has the command of a weekly 
paper called the Music Hall and Theatre Review, looks after 
its interests. In London alone over five millions sterling of 
capital is said to be invested in these enterprises, employing 
80,000 persons of all grades, and entertaining during the year 
about 25,000,000 people. The annual applications for music 
licences in London alone are over 300. (J. Hd.) 

MUSK (Med. Lat. muscus, late Gr. u6<xxos, possibly Pers. 
muskkj from Sansk. mushka, the scrotum), the name originally 
given to a perfume obtained from the strong-smelling substance 
secreted in a gland by the musk-deer (q.v.), and hence applied 
to other animals, and also to plants, possessing a similar odour. 
The variety which appears in commerce is a secretion of the 
musk-deer; but the odour is also emitted by the musk-ox and 
musk-rat of India and Europe, by the musk-duck (Biziura 
lobata) of West Australia, the musk-shrew, the musk-beetle 
(Calichroma moschala), the alligator of Central America, and by 
several other animals. In the vegetable kingdom it is present 
in the common musk (Mimulus moschatus), the musk-wood 
of the Guianas and West Indies (Guarea, spp.), and in the seeds 
of Hibiscus Abelmoschus (musk-seeds). To obtain the perfume 
from the musk-deer the animal is killed and the gland com- 
pletely removed, and dried, either in the sun, on a hot stone, 
or by immersion in hot oil. It appears in commerce as " musk 
in pod," i.e. the glands are entire, or as " musk in grain," in 
which the perfume has been extracted from its receptacle. 
Three kinds are recognized: (1) Tong-king, Chinese or Tibetan, 
imported from China, the most valued; (2) Assam or Nepal, 
less valuable; and (3) Karbardin or Russian (Siberian), imported 
from Central Asia by way of Russia, the least valuable and 
hardly admitting of adulteration. The Tong-king musk is 
exported in small, gaudily decorated caddies with tin or lead 
linings, wherein the perfume is sealed down; it is now usually 
transmitted direct by parcel post to the merchant. 

Good musk is of a dark purplish colour, dry, smooth and 
unctuous to the touch, and bitter in taste. It dissolves in boiling 
water to the extent of about one-half; alcohol takes up one-third 
of the substance, and ether and chloroform dissolve still less. 
A grain of musk will distinctly scent millions of cubic feet of 
air without any appreciable loss of weight, and its scent is not 
only more penetrating but more persistent than that of any 
other known substance. In addition to its odoriferous principle, 
it contains ammonia, cholesterin, fatty matter, a bitter resinous 
substance, and other animal principles. As a material in 
perfumery it is of the first importance, its powerful and enduring 
odour giving strength and permanency to the vegetable essences, 
so that it is an ingredient in many compounded perfumes. 

Artificial musk is a synthetic product, having a similar odour to 
natural musk. It was obtained by Baur in 1888 by condensing 
toluene with isobutyl bromide in the presence of aluminium chloride, 
and nitrating the product. It is a symtrinitro-^-butyl toluene. 
Many similar preparations have been made, and it appears that the 
odour depends upon the symmetry of the three nitro groups. 

MUSK-DEER (Moschus moschijerus) , an aberrant member 
of the deer family constituting the sub-family Cervidae Moschinae 



(see Deer). Both sexes are devoid of antler appendage; 
but in this the musk-deer agrees with one genus of true deei 
(Hydrelaphus), and as in the latter, the upper canine teeth of 
the males are long and sabre-like, projecting below the chin, 
with the ends turned somewhat backwards. In size the musk- 
deer is rather less than the European roe-deer, being about 
20 in. high at the shoulder. Its limbs, especially the hinder 
pair, are long; and the feet remarkable for the great develop- 
ment of the lateral pair of hoofs and for the freedom of motion

they all present, which must be of assistance to the animal 
in steadying it in its agile bounds among the crags of its native 
haunts. The ears are large, and the tail rudimentary. The 
hair covering the body is long, coarse, and of a peculiarly 
brittle and pith-like character, breaking easily; it is generally 
of a greyish-brown colour, sometimes inclined to yellowish-red, 
and often variegated with lighter patches. The musk-deer 
inhabits the forest districts in the Himalaya as far west as 
Gilgit, always, however, at great elevations — being rarely 
found in summer below 8000 ft. above the sea-level, and ranging 
as high as the limits of the thickets of birch, rhododendron 
and juniper, among which it mostly conceals itself in the day- 
time. The range extends into Tibet, Siberia and north- 
western China; but the musk-deer of Kansu has been separated 
as a distinct species, under the name of M . sifanicus. Musk- 
deer are hardy, solitary and retiring animals, chiefly nocturnal 
in habits, and almost always found alone, rarely in pairs and 
never in herds. They are exceedingly active and surefooted, 
having perhaps no equal in traversing rocks and precipitous 
ground; and they feed on moss, grass, and leaves of the plants 
which grow on the mountains. 

Most mammals have certain portions of the skin specially 
modified and provided with glands secreting odorous and fatty 
substances characteristic of the particular species. The special 
gland of the musk-deer, which has made the animal so well 
known, and has proved the cause of unremitting persecution 
to its possessor, is found in the male only, and is a sac about 
the size of a small orange, situated beneath the skin of the 
abdomen, the orifice being immediately in front of the preputial 
aperture. The secretion with which the sac is filled is dark 
brown or chocolate in colour, and when fresh of the consistence 
of " moist gingerbread," but becoming dry and granular after 
keeping (see Musk). The Kansu (M. sifanicus) differs from 
the typical species in having longer ears, which are black on 
the outer surface. 

MUSKEGON, a city and the county-seat of Muskegon 
county, Michigan, U.S.A., on Muskegon lake, an expansion 
of Muskegon river near its mouth, about 4 m. from Lake 
Michigan and 38 m. N.W. of Grand Rapids. Pop. (1890), 
22,702; (1900), 20,818, of whom 6236 were foreign-born;

(1910 census) 24,062. It is served by the Grand Trunk, 
the Pere Marquette, the Grand Rapids & Indiana, and the 
Grand Rapids, Grand Haven & Muskegon (electric) railways, 
and by steamboat lines to Chicago, Milwaukee and other lake 
ports. There are several summer resorts in the vicinity. As 
the gifts of Charles H. Hackley (1837-1905), a rich lumberman, 
the city has an endowment fund to the public schools of about 
$2,000,000; a manual training school, which has an endowment 
of $600,000, and is one of the few endowed public schools in 
the United States; a public library, with an endowment of 
-$275,000; a public hospital with a $600,000 endowment; and 
a poor fund endowment of $300,000. In Hackley Park there 
are statues of^ Lincoln and Farragut, and at the' Hackley School 
there is a statue of McKinley; all three are by C. H. Niehaus. 
The municipality owns and operates its water-works. Muskegon 
lake is 5 m. long and i| m. wide, with a depth of 30 to 40 ft., 
and is ice-free throughout the year. The channel from Muskegon 
lake to Lake Michigan has been improved to a depth of 20 ft.- 
and a width of 300 ft. by the Federal government since 1867. 
From Muskegon are shipped large quantities of lumber and 
market-garden produce, besides the numerous manufactures 
of the city. The total value of all factory products in 1904 
was $6,319,441 (39-6% more than in 1900), of which more 
than one-sixth was the value of lumber. A trading post was 
established here in 181 2, but a permanent settlement was 
not established until 1834. Muskegon was laid out as a town 
in 1849, incorporated as a village in 1861, and chartered as a 
city in 1869. The name is probably derived from a Chippewa 
word, maskeg or muskeg, meaning " grassy bog," still used in 
that sense in north-western America. 

MUSKET (Fr. mousquet, Ger. Muskete, &c), the term generally 
applied to the firearm of the infantry soldier from about 1550 
up to and even beyond the universal adoption of rifled small 
arms about 1850-1860. The word originally signified a male 
sparrowhawk (Italian moschetto, derived perhaps ultimately 
from Latin musca, a fly) and its application to the weapon may 
be explained by the practice of naming firearms after birds 
and beasts (cf. falcon, basilisk). Strictly speaking, the word 
is inapplicable both to the early hand-guns and to the arquebuses 
and cali vers that superseded the hand-guns. The " musket " 
proper, introduced into the Spanish army by the duke of Alva, 
was much heavier and more powerful than the arquebus. Its 
bullet retained sufficient striking energy to stop a horse at 500 
and 600 yards from the muzzle. A writer in 1598 (quoted 
s.v. in the New English Dictionary) goes so far as to say 
that " One good musket may be accounted for two callivers." 
Unlike the arquebus, it was fired from a rest, which the 
" musketeer " stuck into the ground in front of him. But 
during the 17th century the musket in use was so far improved 
that the rest could be dispensed with (see Gun). The musket 
was a matchlock, weapons with other forms of lock being 
distinguished as wheel-locks, firelocks, snaphances, &c, and 
soldiers were similarly distinguished as musketeers and fusiliers. 
On the disuse, about 1 690-1 695, of this form of firing mechanism, 
the term " musket " was, in France at least, for a time discon- 
tinued in favour of " fusil," or flint-lock, which thenceforward 
reigned supreme up to the introduction of a practicable per- 
cussion lock about 1830-1840. But the term " musket " 
survived the thing it originally represented, and was currently 
used for the firelock (and afterwards for the percussion weapon). 
To-day it is generically used for military firearms anterior to 
the modern rifle. The original meaning of the word musketry 
has remained almost unaltered since 1600; it signifies the fire of 
infantry small-arms (though for this " rifle fire " is now a far 
more usual term), and in particular the art of using them 
(see Infantry and Rifle). Of the derivatives, the only one 
that is not self-explanatory is musketoon. This was a short, 
large-bore musket somewhat of the blunderbuss type, originally 
designed for the use of cavalry, but afterwards, in the 18th 
century, chiefly a domestic or coachman's weapon. 

MUSKHOGEAN STOCK, a North American Indian stock. The 
name is from that of the chief tribe of the Creek confederacy, 



the Muskogee. It includes the Creeks, Choctaws, Chickasaws, 
Seminoles and other tribes. Its territory was almost the 
whole state of Mississippi, western Tennessee, eastern Kentucky, 
Alabama, most of Georgia, and later nearly all Florida. Musk- 
hogean traditions assign the west and north-west as the original 
home of the stock.- Its history begins in 1527, on the first 
landing of the Spaniards on the Gulf Coast. The Muskhogean * 
peoples were then settled agriculturists with an elaborate social 
organization, and living in villages, many of which were fortified 
(see Indians: North American). 

MUSKOGEE, a city and the county-seat of Muskogee county, 
Oklahoma, U.S.A., about 3 m. W. by S. of the confluence of the 
Verdigris, Neosho (or Grand) and Arkansas rivers, and about 
130 m. E.N.E. of Oklahoma City. Pop. (1900), 4154; (1907), 
14,418, of whom 4298 were negroes and 332 Indians; (1910), 25,278. 
It is served by the St Louis & San Francisco, the Midland 
Valley, the Missouri, Kansas & Texas, and the Missouri, 
Oklahoma & Gulf railways. Fort Gibson (pop. in 1910, 1344), 
about 5 m. N.E. on the Neosho, near its confluence with the 
Arkansas, is the head of steam-boat navigation of the 
Arkansas; if is the site of a former government fort and of a 
national cemetery. Muskogee is the seat of Spaulding Institute 
(M.E. Church, South) and Nazareth Institute (Roman Catholic), 
and at Bacone, about 2 m. north-east, is Indian University 
(Baptist, opened 1884). Muskogee is the commercial centre of 
an agricultural and stock-raising region, is surrounded by 
an oil and natural, gas field of considerable extent producing 
a high grade of petroleum, and has a large oil refinery, railway 
shops (of the Midland Valley and the Missouri, Oklahoma & 
Gulf railways), cotton gins, cotton compresses, and cotton-seed 
oil and flour mills. The municipality owns and operates the 
water-works, the water supply being drawn from the Neosho 
river. Muskogee was founded about 1870, and became the 
chief town of the Creek Nation (Muskogee) and the metropolis 
and administrative centre of the former Indian Territory, 
being the headquarters of the Union Indian Agency to the 
Five Civilized Tribes, of the United States (Dawes) Commission 
to the Five Civilized Tribes, and of a Federal land office for 
the allotment of lands to the Creeks and Cherokees, and the 
seat of a Federal Court. The city was chartered in 1898; its 
area was enlarged in 1908, increasing its population. 

MUSK-OX, also known as musk-buffalo and musk-sheep, 
an Arctic American ruminant of the family Bovidae (g.tf.), 
now representing a genus and sub-family by itself. Apparently 
the musk-ox (Ovibos mosckatus) has little or no near relation- 
ship to either the oxen or the sheep; and it is not improbable 
that its affinities are with the Asiatic takin (Budorcas) and the 
extinct European Criotherium of the Pliocene of Samos. The 
musky odour from which the animal takes its name does not 
appear to be due to the secretion of any gland. 

In height a bull musk-ox stands about 5 ft. at the shoulder. 
The head is large and broad. The horns in old males have 
extremely broad bases, meeting in the middle line, and covering 
the brow and crown of the head. They are directed at first 
downwards by the side of the face, and then turn upwards 
and forwards, ending in the same plane as the eye. The basal 
half is dull white, oval in section and coarsely fibrous, the middle 
part smooth, shining and round, and the tip black. In females 
and young males the horns are smaller, and their bases separated 
by a space in the middle of the forehead- The ears are small, 
erect, pointed, and nearly concealed in the hair. The space 
between the nostrils and the upper lip is covered with short 
close hair, as in sheep and goats, without any trace of the bare 
muzzle of oxen. The greater part of the animal is covered with 
long brown hair, thick, matted and curly on the shoulders, 
so as to give the appearance of a hump, but elsewhere straight 
and hanging down — that of the sides, back and haunches 
reaching as far as the middle of the legs and entirely concealing 
the very short tail. There is also a thick woolly under-fur, 
shed in summer, when the whole coat comes off in blanket-like 
masses. The hair on the lower jaw, throat and chest is long 
and straight, and hangs down like a beard or dewlap, though

there is no loose fold of skin in this situation. The limbs are 
stout and short, terminating in unsymmetrical hoofs, the external 
being rounded, the internal pointed, and the sole partially 
covered with hair. 

Musk-oxen at the present day are confined to the most 
northern parts of North America, where they range over the 
rocky Barren Grounds between lat. 64° and the shores of the 
Arctic Sea. Its southern range is gradually contracting, and 
it appears that it is no longer met with west of the Mackenzie 
river, though formerly abundant as far as Eschscholtz Bay. 




The Musk-ox (Ovibos moschatus). 
Northwards and eastwards it extends through the Parry 
Islands and Grinnell Land to north Greenland, reaching on 
the west coast as far south as Melville Bay; and it also occurs 
at Sabine Island on the east coast. The Greenland animal is 
a distinct race (0. w. wardi), distinguished by white hair on 
the forehand; and it is suggested that the one from Grinnell 
Land forms a third race. As proved by the discovery of fossil 
remains, musk-oxen ranged during the Pleistocene period over 
northern Siberia and the plains of Germany and France, their 
bones occurring in river-deposits along with those of the rein- 
deer, mammoth, and woolly rhinoceros. They have also been 
found in Pleistocene gravels in several parts of England, as 
Maidenhead, Bromley, Freshficld near Bath, Barnwood near 
Gloucester, and in the brick-earth of the Thames valley at Cray- 
ford, Kent; while their remains also occur in Arctic America. 

Musk-oxen are gregarious in habit, assembling in herds of 
twenty or thirty head, or sometimes eighty or a hundred, in 
which there are seldom more than two or three full-grown 
males. They run with considerable speed, notwithstanding 
the shortness of their legs. They feed chiefly on grass, but 
also on moss, lichens and tender shoots of the willow and pine. 
The female brings forth one young in the end of May or begin- 
ning of June, after a gestation of nine months. The Swedish 
expedition to Greenland in 1899 found musk-oxen in herds 
of varying size — some contained only a few individuals, and 
in one case there were sixty-seven. The peculiar musky odour 
was perceived from a distance of a hundred yards; but accord- 
ing to Professor Nathoist there was no musky taste or smell in 
the flesh if the carcase were cleaned immediately the animals 
were killed. 

Of late years musk-oxen have been exhibited alive in Europe; 
and two examples, one of which lived from 1899 till 1903, have 
been brought to England. The somewhat imperfect skull of an 
extinct species of musk-ox from the gravels of the Klondike has 
enabled Mr W. H. Osgood to make an important addition to our 
knowledge of this remarkable type of ruminant. The skull, which 
is probably that of a female, differs from the ordinary musk-ox by 
the much smaller and shorter horn-cores, which are widely separ- 
ated in the middle line of the skull, where there is a groove-like 
depression running the whole length of the forehead. The sockets 
of the eyes are also much less prominent, and the whole fore-part of 
the skull is proportionately longer. On account of these and other 
differences (for which the reader may refer to the original paper, 
published in vol. xlviii. of the Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections) 



its describer refers the Klondike skull to a new genus, with the 
title Symbos tyrrelli, the specific name being given in honour of its 
discoverer. This, however, is not all, for Mr Osgood points out 
that a skull discovered many years ago in the vicinity of Fort 
Gibson, Oklahoma, and then named Ovibos or Bdotherium cavifrons, 
evidently belongs to the same genus. That skull indicates a bull, 
and the author suggests that it may possibly be the male of Symbos 
tyrrelliy although the wide separation of the localities made him 
hesitate to accept this view. Perhaps it would have been better 
had he done so, and taken the name Symbos cavifrons for the species. 
A third type of musk-ox skull is, however, known from North 
America, namely one from the celebrated Big-Bone Lick, Kentucky, 
on which the genus and species Bdotherium bombifrons was estab- 
lished, which differs from all the others by its small size, convex 
forehead and rounded horn-cores, the latter being very widely 
separated, and arising from the sides of the skull. This specimen 
has been regarded as the female of Symbos cavifrons; but this 
view, as pointed out bv Mr Osgood, is almost certainly incorrect, 
and it represents an entirely distinct form. 

This, however, is not the whole of the past history of the musk- 
ox group ; and in this connexion it may be mentioned that palaeonto- 
logical discoveries are gradually making it evident that the poverty 
of America in species of horned ruminants is to a great extent a 
feature of the present day, and that in past times it possessed a 
considerable number of representatives of this group. One of the 
latest additions to the list is a large sheep-like animal from a cave 
in California, apparently representing a new generic type, which 
has been described by E. L. Furlong in the publications of the 
University of California, under the name of Preptoceras sinclairi. 
It is represented by a nearly complete skeleton, and has doubly- 
curved horns and sheep-like teeth. In common with an allied 
ruminant from the same district, previously described as Eucera- 
therium, it seems probable that Preptoceras is related on the one 
hand to the musk-ox, and on the other to the Asiatic takin, while 
it is also supposed to have affinities with the sheep. If these 
extinct forms really serve to connect the takin with the musk-ox, 
their systematic importance will be very great. From a geographical 
point of view nothing is more likely, for the takin forms a type 
confined to Eastern Asia (Tibet and Szechuen), and it would be 
reasonable to expect that, like so many other peculiar forms from 
the same region, they should have representatives on the American 
side of the Pacific. (R. L.*) 

MUSK-RAT, or Musquash, the name of a large North Ameri- 
can rat-like rodent mammal, technically known as Fiber zibe- 
thicus, and belonging "to the mouse-tribe (Muridae). Aquatic 
in habits, this animal is related to the English water-rat and 
therefore included in the sub-family Microtinae (see Vole). It 
is, however, of larger size, the head and body being about 12 in. 




The Musk-rat (Fiber zibethkus). 

in length and the tail but little less. It is rather a heavily- 
built animal, with a broad head, no distinct neck, and short 
limbs, the eyes are small, and the ears project very little beyond 
the fur. The fore-limbs have four toes and a rudimentary 
thumb, all with claws; the hind limbs are larger, with five distinct 
toes, united by short webs at their bases. The tail is laterally 
compressed, nearly naked, and scaly. The hair much resembles 
that of a beaver, but is shorter; it consists of a thick soft under- 
fur, interspersed with longer stiff, glistening hairs, which oveilie 
and conceal the former, on the upper surface and sides of the 



MUSK-SHREW— MUSPRATT, J. 



body. The general colour is dark umber-brown, almost black 
on the back and grey below. The tail and naked parts of the 
feet are black. The musky odour from which it derives its 
name is due to the secretion of a large gland situated in the 
inguinal region, and present in both sexes. 

The ordinary musk-rat is one of several species of a genus 
peculiar to America, where it is distributed in suitable localities 
in the northern part of the continent, extending from the 
Atlantic to the Pacific, and from the Rio Grande to the barren 
grounds bordering the Arctic seas. It lives on the shores of 
lakes and rivers, swimming and diving with facility, feeding on 
the roots, stems and leaves of water-plants, or on fruits and 
vegetables which grow near the margin of the streams it inhabits. 
Musk-rats are most active at night, spending the greater part 
of the day concealed in their burrows in the bank, which consist 
of a chamber with numerous passages, all of which open under 
the surface of the water. For winter quarters they build more 
elaborate houses of conical or dome-like form, composed of 
sedges, grasses and similar materials plastered together with 
mud. As their fur is an important article of commerce, large 
numbers are annually killed, being either trapped or speared 
at the mouths of their holes. (See also Rodentia.) 

MUSK-SHREW, a name for any species of the genus Crocidura 
of the family Soricidae (see Insectivora). The term is generally 
used of the common grey musk-shrew (C. coerulea) of India. 
Dr Dobson believed this to be a semi-domesticated variety of the 
brown musk-shrew (C. murina), which he considered the original 
wild type. The head and body of a full-grown specimen measure 
about 6 in.; the tail is rather more than half that length; and 
bluish-grey is the usual colour of the fur, which is paler on the 
under surface. Dr Blanford states that the story of wine or beer 
becoming impregnated with a musky taint in consequence of 
this shrew passing over the bottles, is less credited in India 
than formerly owing to the discovery that liquors bottled in 
Europe and exported to India are not liable to be thus tainted. 

MUSLIM IBN AL-HAJJAJ, the Imam, the author of one of 
the two books of Mahommedan tradition called SahtJt, " sound," 
was born at Nishapur at some uncertain date after a.d. 815 and 
died there in 875. Like al-Bukhari (q.v.), of whom he was a 
close and faithful friend, he gave himself to the collecting, sifting 
and arranging of traditions, travelling for the purpose as far as 
Egypt. It is plain that his sympathies were with the traditionalist 
school or opposed to that which sought to build up the system 
of canon law on a speculative basis (see Mahommedan Law). 
But though he was a student and friend of Ahmad ibn IJanbal 
(q.v.) he did not go in traditionalism to the length of some, and 
he defended al-Bukhari when the latter was driven from Nishapur 
for lefusing to admit that the utterance Qafz) of the Koran by 
man was as uncreated as the Koran itself (see Mahommedan 
Religion; and Patton's Ahmad ibn Hanbal, 32 sqq.). His great 
collection of traditions is second in popularity only to that of 
al-Bukhari, and is commonly regarded as more accurate and 
reliable in details, especially names. His object was more to 
weed out illegitimate accretions than to furnish a traditional 
basis for a system of law. Therefore, though he arranged his 
material according to such a system, he did not add guiding 
rubrics, and he regularly brought together in one place the 
different parallel versions of the same tradition. His book is 
thus historically more useful, but legally less suggestive. His 
biographers give almost no details as to his life, and its early 
part was probably very obscure. One gives a list of as many 
as twenty works, but only his Santh seems to have reached us.

MUSLIN (through Fr. moussdine from It. mussolino, diminu- 
tive of Mussolo, i.e. the town Mosul in Kurdistan) a light cotton 
cloth said to have been first made at Mosul, a city of Mesopo- 
tamia. Muslins have been largely made in various parts of 
India, whence they were imported to England towards the end 



93 

of the 17th century. Some of these Indian muslins were very 
fine and costly. Among the specialties are Arni muslin, made 
in the Madras presidency, and Dacca muslin, made at Dacca 
in Bengal. Muslins of many kinds are now made in Europe 
and America, and the name is applied to both plain and fancy 
cloths, and to printed calicoes of light texture. Swiss muslin 
is a light variety, woven in stripes or figures, originally made 
in Switzerland. Book muslin is made in Scotland from very 
fine yarns. Mulls, jaconets, Ienos, and other cloths exported 
to the East and elsewhere are sometimes described as muslins. 
Muslin is used for dresses, blinds, curtains, &c. 

MUSONIUS RUFUS, a Roman philosopher of the 1st century 
a.d., was born in Etruria about a.d. 20-30. He fell under 
the ban of Nero owing to his ethical teachings, and was exiled 
to the island of Gyarus on a trumped-up charge of participation 
in Piso's conspiracy. He returned under Galba, and was the 
friend of Vitellius and Vespasian. It was he who dared to bring 
an accusation against P. Egnatius Celer (the Stoic philosopher 
whose evidence had condemned his patron and disciple Soranus) 
and who endeavoured to preach a doctrine of peace and good- 
will among the soldiers of Vespasian when they were advancing 
upon Rome. So highly was he esteemed in Rome that Vespasian 
made an exception in his case when all other philosophers were 
expelled from the city. As to his death, we know only that 
he was not living in the reign of Trajan. His philosophy, 
which is in most respects identical with that of his pupil, 
Epictetus, is marked by its strong practical tendency. Though 
he did not altogether neglect .logic and physics, he maintained 
that virtue is the only real aim of men. This virtue is not a 
thing of precept and theory but a practical, living reality. It 
is identical with philosophy in the true sense of the word, and 
the truly good man is also the true philosopher. 

Suidas attributes numerous works to him, amongst others a 
number of^ letters to Apollonius of Tyana. The letters are certainly 
unauthentic; about the others there is no evidence. His views 
were collected by Claudius (or Valerius) Pollio, who 'wrote 'Ato- 
fxvrjiioPeiiJiaTa Mowcovtov rov <£iXoct6<£ov, from which Stobaeus 
obtained his information. See Ritter and Preller §§ 477, 488, 489; 
Tacitus, Annais, xv. 71 and Histories, iii. 81 ; and compare articles 
Stoics and Epictetus. 

MUSPRATT, JAMES (1793-1886), British chemical manu- 
facturer, was born in Dublin on the 12th of August 1793. At 
the age of fourteen he was apprenticed to a wholesale druggist, 
but his apprenticeship was terminated in 18 10 by a quarrel 
with his master, and in 1812 he went to Spain to take part in 
the Peninsular War. Lack of influence prevented him from 
getting a commission in the cavalry, but he followed the British 
army on foot far into the interior, was laid up with fever at 
Madrid, and, narrowly escaping capture by the French, succeeded 
in making his way to Lisbon. There he joined the navy, but 
after taking part in the blockade of Brest he was led to desert, 
through the harshness of the discipline on the second of the two 
ships in which he served. Returning to Dublin about 1814, 
he began the manufacture of chemical products, such as hydro- 
chloric and acetic acids and turpentine, adding prussiate of 
potash a few years later. He also had in view the manufacture 
of alkali from common salt by the Leblanc process, but on the 
one hand he could not command the capital for the plant, and 
on the other saw that Dublin was not well situated for the experi- 
ment. In 1822 he went to Liverpool, which was at once a good 
port and within easy reach of salt and coal, and took a lease of 
an abandoned glass-works on the bank of the canal in Vauxhall 
Road. At first he confined himself to prussiate of potash, until 
in 1823, when the tax on salt was reduced from 15s. to 2s. a 
bushel, his profits enabled him to erect lead-chambers for making 
the sulphuric acid necessary for the Leblanc process. In 1828 
he built works at St Helen's and in 1830 at Newton; at the latter 
place he was long harassed by litigation on account of the 
damage done by the hydrochloric acid emitted from his factory, 
and finally in 1850 he left it and started new works at Widnes 
and Flint. In 1834-1835, in conjunction with Charles Tennant, 
he purchased sulphur mines in Sicily, to provide the raw material 
for his sulphuric acid; but on the imposition of the Neapolitan

MUSSCHENBROEK— MUSSEL 



government of a prohibitive duty on sulphur Muspratt found 
a substitute in iron pyrites, which was thus introduced as the 
raw material for the manufacture of sulphuric acid. He was 
always anxious to employ the best scientific advice available 
and to try every novelty that promised advantage. He was 
a close friend of Liebig, whose mineral manures were compounded 
at his works. He died at Seaforth Hall, near Liverpool, on the 
4th of May 1886. After his retirement in 1857 his business was 
continued in the hands of four of his ten children. 

His eldest son, James Sheridan Muspratt (1821-1871), 
studied chemistry under Thomas Graham at Glasgow and 
London and under Liebig at Giessen, and in 1848 founded the 
Liverpool College of Chemistry, an institution for training 
chemists, of which he also acted as director. From 1854 to 
i860 he was occupied in preparing a dictionary of Chemistry . . . 
as applied and relating to the Arts and Manufactures, which 
was translated into German and Russian, and he published a 
translation of Plattner's treatise on the blow-pipe in 1845, and 
Outlines of Analysis in 1849. His original work included a 
research on the sulphites (1845), and the preparation of toluidine 
and nitro-aniline in 1845-1846 with A. W. Hofmann. 

MUSSCHENBROEK, PIETER VAN (1692-1761), Dutch 
natural philosopher, was born on the 14th of March 1692 at 
Leiden, where his father Johann Joosten van Musschenbroek 
( 1 660-1 707) was a maker of physical apparatus. He studied 
at the university of his native city, where he was a pupil and 
friend of W. J. s'G. Gravesande. Graduating in 1715 with a 
dissertation, De aeris praesentia in humoribus animdlium t Mus- 
schenbroek was appointed professor at Duisburg in 17 19. In 
1723 he was promoted to the chair of natural philosophy and 
mathematics at Utrecht. In 1731 he declined an invitation 
to Copenhagen, and was promoted in consequence to the chair 
of astronomy at Utrecht in 1732. The attempt of George II. 
of England in 1737 to attract him to the newly-established 
university of Gottingen was also unsuccessful. At length, 
however, the claims of his native city overcame his resolution 
to remain at Utrecht, and he accepted the mathematical chair 
at Leiden in 1739, where, declining all offers from abroad, he 
remained till his death on the 9th of September 1761. 

His first important production was Epitome elementorum physico- 
mathematicorum (i2mo, Leiden, 1726) — a work which was after- 
wards gradually altered as it passed through several editions, and 
which appeared at length (posthumously, ed. by t Johann Lulofs, 
one of his colleagues as Leiden) in 1762, under the title of Introductio 
ad philosophiam naturalem. The Physicae experimentales et geo- 
metrical dissertationes (1729) threw new light on magnetism, capillary 
attraction, and the cohesion of bodies. A Latin edition with notes 
(1731) of the Italian work Saggi di naturali esperienze fatte nell- 
rAccademia del Cimentq contained among many otherinvestigations 
a description of a new instrument, the pyrometer, which Musschen- 
broek had invented, and of several experiments which he had made 
on the expansion of bodies by heat. Musschenbroek was also the 
author of Elementa physica (8vo, 1729), and his name is associated 
with the invention of the Leyden jar \q.v .). 

MUSSEL (O. Eng. muscle, Lat. musculus, diminutive of mus, 
mouse, applied to small sea fish and mussels), a term applied 
in England to two families of Lamellibranch Molluscs — the 
marine Mytilacea, of which, the edible mussel, Mytilus edulis, 
is the representative; and the fresh-water Unionidae, of which 
the river mussel, Unio pictorum, and the swan mussel, Anodonta 
cygnea, are the common British examples. It is not obvious 
why these fresh-water forms have been associated popularly 
with the Mytilacea under the name mussel, unless it be. on 
account of the frequently very dark colour of their shells. They 
are somewhat remote from the sea mussels in structure, and have 
not even a common economic importance. 

The sea mussel {Mytilus edulis) belongs to the second order 
of the class Lamellibranchia (q.v.), namely the Filibranchia, 
distinguished by the comparatively free condition of the gill- 
filaments, which, whilst adhering to one another to form gill- 
plates, are yet not fused to one another by concrescence. It is 
also remarkable' for the small size of its foot and the large 
development of two glands in the foot — the byssus-forming and 
the byssus-cementing glands. The byssus is a collection of 



horny threads by which the sea mussel (like many other Lamelli- 
branch or bivalve molluscs) fixes itself to stones, rocks or 
submerged wood, but is not a permanent means of attachment, 
since it can be discarded by the animal, which, after a certain 
amount of locomotion, again fixes itself by new secretion of 
byssus from the foot. Such movement is more frequent in 
young mussels than in the full-grown. Mytilus possesses no 
siphonal tube-like productions of the margin of the mantle-skirt, 
nor any notching of the same, representative of the siphons 
which are found in its fresh-water ally, the Dreissensia poly- 
morpha. 

Mytilus edulis is an exceedingly abundant and widely distri- 
buted form. It occurs on both sides of the northern Atlantic 
and in the Mediterranean basin. It presents varieties of form 
and colour according to the depth of water and other circum- 
stances of its habitat. Usually it is found on the British coast 
encrusting rocks exposed at low tides, or on the flat surfaces 
formed by sandbanks overlying clay, the latter kind of colonies 
being known locally as " scalps." Under these conditions it 
forms continuous masses of individuals closely packed together, 
sometimes extending over many acres of surface and numbering 
millions. The readiness with which the young Mytilus attaches 
itself to wicker-work is made the means of artificially cultivating 
and securing these molluscs for the market both in the Bay of 
Kiel in North Germany and at the mouth of the Somme and other 
spots on the coast of France. 

Natural scalps are subject to extreme vicissitudes: an area 
of many acres may be destroyed by a local change of current 
producing a deposit of sand or shingle over the scalp, or by 
exposure to frost at low tide in winter, or by accumulation of 
decomposing vegetable matter. The chief localities of natural 
scalps on the British coast are Morecambe Bay in Lancashire 
and the flat eastern shores, especially that of the Wash of Lincoln, 
and similar shallow bays. These scalps are in some cases in 
the hands of private owners, and the Fisheries Department has 
made arrangements by which some local authorities, e.g. the 
corporation of Boston, can lease layings to individuals for the 
purpose of artificial cultivation. 

The sea mussel is scarcely inferior in commercial value to the 
oyster. In 1873 the value of mussels exported from Antwerp 
alone to Paris to be used^ as human food was £280,000. In Britain 
their chief consumption is in the deep-sea line fishery, where they 
are held to be the most effective of all baits. Twenty-eight boats 
engaged in haddock-fishing at Eyemouth used between October 
1882 and May^ 1883 920 tons of mussels (about 47,000,000 in- 
dividuals), costing nearly £1800 to the fishermen, about one-half of 
which sum was expended on the carriage of the mussels. The 
quantity of mussels landed on^ Scottish coasts has decreased in 
recent years owing to the decline in the line fisheries. In 1896 
the quantity was over 243,000 cwts., valued at £14,550; in 1902 it 
was only 95,663 cwts., valued at £5976. In the statistics for England 
and Wales mussels are not separately distinguished. Many thou- 
sand tons of musselsare wastefully employed as manure by the 
farmers on lands adjoining scalp-producing coasts, as in Lancashire 
and Norfolk, three half-pence a bushel being the price quoted in 
such cases. It is a curious fact, illustrative of the ignorant pro- 
cedure and arbitrary fashions of fisher-folk, that on the Atlantic 
seaboard of the United States the sea mussel, Mytilus edulis, though 
common,, is not used as bait nor as food. Instead, the soft clam, 
Mya arenaria, a Lamellibranch not used by English or Norwegian 
fishermen, though abundant on their shores, is employed as bait 
by the fishermen to the extent of 1} million bushels per annum, 
valued at £120,000. At the mouth of the river Conway in North 
Wales the sea mussel is crushed in large quantities in order to 
extract pearls of an inferior quality which are occasionally found 
in these as in other Lamellibranch molluscs (Gwyn Jeffreys). 

Mytilus edulis is considered of fair size for eating when it is 
2 in. in length, which size is attained in three years after the spat 
or young mussel has fixed itself. Under favourable circumstances 
it will grow much larger than this, specimens being recorded of 
9 in. in length. It is very tolerant of fresh water, fattening be.st, 
as does the oyster, in water of density 1014 (the density of the water 
of the North Sea being 1026). Experiments made by removing 
mussels from salt water to brackish, and finally to quite fresh 
water show that it is even more tolerant of fresh water than the 
oyster; of thirty mussels so transferred all were alive after fifteen 
days. Mytilus^ edulis is occasionally poisonous, owing to conditions 
not satisfactorily determined. 

The fresh- water Mussels, Anodonta cygnea, Unio pictorum,

and Unto margaritiferus belong to the order Eulamellibranchia 
of Lamellibranch Molluscs, in which the anterior and posterior 
adductor muscles are equally developed. An account of the 
anatomy of Anodon is given in the article Lamelubranchia. 
Unto differs in no important point from Anodonta in internal 
structure. The family Unionidae, to which these genera belong, 
is of world-wide distribution, and its species occur only in ponds 
and rivers. A vast number of species arranged in several genera 
and sub-genera have been distinguished, but in the British 
Islands the three species above named are the only claimants to 
the title of "fresh-water mussel." 

Anodonta cygnea, the Pond Mussel or Swan Mussel, appears to be 
entirely without economic importance. Unto pictorum, the common 
river mussel (Thames), appears to owe its name to the fact that the 
shells were used at one time for holding water-colour paints as now 
shells of this species and of the sea mussel are used for holding 
gold and silver paint sold by artists' colourmen, but it has no other 
economic value. Unto margaritiferus, the pearl mussel, was at 
one time of considerable importance as a source of pearls, and the 
pearl mussel fishery is to this day carried on under peculiar^ state 
regulations in Sweden and Saxony, and other parts of the continent. 
In Scotland and Ireland the pearl mussel fishery^ was also of im- 
portance, but has altogether dwindled into insignificance since the 
opening up of commercial intercourse with the East and with the 
islands of the Pacific Ocean, whence finer and more abundant 
pearls than those of Unio margaritiferus are derived. 

In the last forty years of the 18th century pearls were exported 
from the Scotch fisheries to Paris to the value of £100,000; round 
pearls, the size of a pea, perfect in every respect^ were worth £3 
or £4. The pearl mussel was formerly used as bait in the Aberdeen 
cod fishery. 

Literature. — For an account of the anatomy of Mytilus edulis 
the reader is referred to the treatise by Sabatier on that subject 
(Paris, 1875). The essay by Charles Harding on Molluscs used 
for Food or Bait, published by the committee of the London Inter- 
national Fisheries Exhibition (1883), may be consulted as to the 
economic questions connected with the sea mussel. The develop- 
ment of this species is described by Wilson in Fifth Ann. Rep. 
Scot Fish. Board (1887). (E. R. L.; J. T. C.) 

MUSSELBURGH, a municipal and police burgh of Midlothian, 
Scotland, si m * E. of Edinburgh by the North British railway. 
Pop. (1001), 11,711. The burgh, which stretches for a mile 
along the south shore of the Firth of Forth, is intersected by the 
Esk and embraces the village of Fisherrow on the left bank of 
the river. Its original name is said to have been Eskmouth, its 
present one being derived from a bed of mussels at the mouth of 
the river. While preserving most of the ancient features of its 
High Street, the town has tended to become a suburb of the 
capital, its fine beach and golf course hastening this development. 
The public buildings include the town-hall (dating"from 1762 and 
altered in 1876), the tolbooth (1590), and the grammar school. 
Loretto School, one of the foremost public schools in Scotland, 
occupies the site of the chapel of Our Lady of Loretto, which 
was founded in 1534 by Thomas Duthie, a hermit from Mt 
Sinai. This was the favourite shrine of Mary of Guise, who 
betook herself hither at momentous crises in her history. The 
1st earl of Hertford destroyed it in 1544, and after it was rebuilt 
the Reformers demolished it again, some of its stones being 
used in erecting the tolbooth. In the west end of the town is 
Pinkie House, formerly a seat of the abbot of Dunfermline, 
but transformed in 1613 by Lord Seton. It is a fine example 
of a Jacobean mansion, with a beautiful fountain in the 
middle of the court-yard. The painted gallery, with an elabor- 
ate ceiling, 100 ft. long, was utilized as a hospital after the 
battle of Pinkie in 1547. Prince Charles Edward slept in it 
the night following the fight at Prestonpans (1745). Near 
the tolbooth stands the market cross, a stone column with 
a unicorn on the top supporting the burgh arms. At the 
west end of High Street is a statue of David Macbeth 
Moir (" Delta," 1798-1851), Musselburgh's most famous son. 
The antiquity of the town is placed beyond doubt by the 
Roman bridge across the Esk and the Roman remains found 
in its vicinity. The chief bridge, which carries the high road 
from Edinburgh to Berwick, was built by John Rennie in 
1807. The principal industries include paper-making, brewing, 
the making of nets and twine, bricks, tiles and pottery, 
tanning and oil-refining, besides saltworks and seed-crushing 



works. The fishery is confined to Fisherrow, where there is 
a good harbour. The Links are the scene every year of the 
Edinburgh race meetings and of those of the Royal Caledonian 
Hunt which are held every third year. Archery contests also 
take place at intervals under the auspices of the Royal Company 
of Archers. Most of the charitable institutions — for instance, 
the convalescent home, fever hospital, home for girls and Red 
House home — are situated at Inveresk, about 1 J m. up the Esk. 
About 1 m. south-east is the site of the battle of Pinkie, 
and 2 i m. south-east, on the verge of Haddingtonshire, is 
Carberry Hill, where Mary surrendered to the lords of the 
Congregation in 1567, the spot being still known as Queen 
Mary's Mount. Musselburgh joins with Leith and Portobello 
(the Leith Burghs) in returning one member to parliament. 

MUSSET, LOUIS CHARLES ALFRED DE (1810-1857), French 
poet, play- writer and novelist, was born on the nth of December 
1810 in a house in the middle of old Paris, near the H6tel Cluny. 
His father, Victor de Musset, who traced his descent back as far 
as 1 140, held several ministerial posts of importance. He brought 
out an edition of J. J. Rousseau's works in 182 1, and followed 
it soon after with a volume on the Genevan's life and writing. 
In Alfred de Musset 's childhood there were various things 
which fostered his imaginative power. He and his brother 
Paul (born 1804, died 1880), who afterwards wrote a biography 
of Alfred, delighted in reading old romances together, and in 
assuming the characters of the heroes in those romances. But 
it was not until about 1826 that Musset gave any definite sign of 
the mental force which afterwards distinguished him. In the 
summer of 1827 he won the second prize (at the College Henri 
IV.) by an essay on "The Origin of our Feelings." In 1828, 
when Eugene Scribe, Joseph Duveyrier, who under the name of 
Melesville, was a prolific playwriter and sometimes collaborator 
with Scribe, and others of note were in the habit of coming 
to Mme de Musset's house at Auteuil, where drawing-room 
plays and charades were constantly given, Musset, excited 
by this companionship, wrote his first poem. This, to judge 
from the extracts preserved, was neither better nor worse than 
much other work of clever boys who may or may not afterwards 
turn out to be possessed of genius. He took up the study of 
law, threw it over for that of medicine, which he could not 
endure, and ended by adopting no set profession. Shortly 
after his first attempt in verse he was taken by Paul Foucher 
to Victor Hugo's house, where he met such men as Alfred de 
Vigny, Prosper Merim6e, Charles Nodier and Sainte-Beuve. It 
was under Hugo's influence, no doubt, that he composed a 
play. The scene was laid in Spain, and some lines, showing 
a marked advance upon his first effort, are preserved. In 
1828, when the war between the classical and the romantic 
school of literature was growing daily more serious and exciting, 
Musset had published some verses in a country newspaper, 
and boldly recited some of his work to Sainte-Beuve, who 
wrote of it to a friend, " There is amongst us a boy full of genius." 
At eighteen years old Musset produced a translation, with 
additions of his own, of De Quincey's " Opium-Eater." This 
was published by Mame, attracted no attention, and has been 
long out of print. His first original volume was published in 
1829 under the name of Conies d J £spagne et d' Italic, had an 
immediate and striking success, provoked bitter opposition, 
and produced many unworthy imitations. This volume con- 
tained, along with far better and more important things, a 
fantastic parody in verse on certain productions of the romantic 
school, which made a deal of noise at the time. This was the 
famous " Ballade a la Iune " with its recurring comparison of 
the moon shining above a steeple to the dot over an i. It 
was, to Musset's delight, taken quite seriously by many worthy 
folk. 

In December 1830 Musset was just twenty years old, and was 
already conscious of that curious double existence within him 
so frequently symbolized in his plays — in Octave and C61io 
for instance (in Les Caprices de Marianne), who also stand for 
the two camps, the men of matter and the men of feeling — 
which he has elsewhere described as characteristic of his

generation. At this date his piece the Nuit vinitienne was pro- 
duced by Harel, manager of the Odeon. The exact causes of its 
failure might now be far to seek; unlucky stage accidents had 
something to do with it, but there seems reason to believe that 
there was a strongly organized opposition. However this may 
be, the result was disastrous to the French stage; for it put a 
complete damper on the one poet who, as he afterwards showed 
both in theoretical and in practical writings, had the fine insight 
which took in at a glance the merits and defects both of the 
classical and of the romantic schools. Thus he was strong and 
keen to weld together the merits of both schools in a new method 
which, but for the fact that there has been no successor to grasp 
the wand which its originator wielded, might well be called the 
school of Musset. The serious effect produced upon Mussct 
by the failure of his Nuit vinitienne is curiously illustrative of 
his character. A man of greater strength and with equal belief 
in his own genius might have gone on appealing to the public 
until he compelled them to hear him. Musset gave up the 
attempt in disgust, and waited until the public were eager to 
hear him without any invitation on his part. In the case of 
his finest plays this did not happen until after his death; but 
long before that he was fully recognized as a poet of the first 
rank and as an extraordinary master of character and language 
in prose writing. In his complete disgust with the stage after 
the failure above referred to there was no doubt something of 
a not ignoble pride, but there was something also of weakness — 
of a kind of weakness out of which it must be said sprang some 
cf his most exquisite work, some of the poems which could only 
have been written by a man who imagined himself the crushed 
victim of difficulties which were old enough in the experience of 
mankind, though for the moment new and strange to him. 

Musset now belonged, in a not very whole-hearted fashion, 
to the " Cenacle," but the connexion came to an end in 1832. 
In 1833 he published the volume called Un Spectacle dans un 
fauteuil. One of the most striking pieces in this — " Namouna " 
— was written at the publisher's request to fill up some empty 
space; and this fact is noteworthy when taken in conjunction 
with the horror which Musset afterwards so often expressed 
of doing anything like writing " to order " — of writing, indeed, 
in any way or at any moment except when the inspiration 
or the fancy happened to seize him. The success of the 
volume seemed to be small in comparison with that of his Contes 
oVEspagne, but it led indirectly to Musset's being engaged as a 
contributor to the Revue des deux mondes. In this he published, 
in April 1833, Andre del Sarto, and he followed this six weeks 
later with Les Caprices de Marianne. This play afterwards took 
and holds rank as one of the classical pieces in the repertory 
of the TMdtre Franqais, After the retirement in 1887 from 
the stage of the brilliant actor Delaunay the piece dropped 
out of the Francais repertory until it was replaced on the 
stage by M. Jules Clare tie, administrator-general of the Come* die 
Francaise, on the 19th of January 1906. Les Caprices de 
Marianne affords a fine illustration of the method referred to 
above, a method of which Musset gave something like a definite 
explanation five years later. This explanation was also pub- 
lished in the Revue des deux mondes, and it set forth that the 
war between the classical and the romantic schools could never 
end in a definite victory for either school, nor was it desirable 
that it should so end. " It was time," Musset said, " for a third 
school which should unite the merits of each." And in Les 
Caprices de Marianne these merits are most curiously and happily 
combined. It has perhaps more of the Shakespearian quality — 
the quality of artfully mingling the terrible, the grotesque, and 
the high comedy tones — which exists more or less in all Musset's 
long and more serious plays, than is found in any other of these. 
The piece is called a comedy, and it owes this title to its extra- 
ordinary brilliance of dialogue, truth of characterization, and 
swiftness in action, under which there is ever latent a sense of 
impending fate. Many of the qualities indicated are found in 
others of Musset's dramatic works and notably in On ne badine 
pas avec V amour, where the skill in insensibly preparing his 
hearers or readers through a succession' of dazzling comedy 



scenes for the swift destruction of the end is very marked. 
But Les Caprices de Marianne is perhaps for this particular 
purpose of illustration the most compact and most typical of 
all. 

The appearance of Les Caprices de Marianne in the Revue 
(1833) was followed by that of " Rolla," a symptom of the 
maladie du siecle, Rolla, for all the smack which is not to 
be denied of Wertherism, has yet a decided individuality. 
The poem was written at the beginning of Musset's liaison with 
George Sand, and in December 1833 Musset started on the un- 
fortunate journey to Italy. It was well known that the rupture 
of what was for a time a most passionate attachment had a 
disastrous effect upon Musset, and brought out the weakest 
side of his moral character. He was at first absolutely and 
completely struck down by the blow. But it was not so well 
known until Paul de Musset pointed it out that the passion 
expressed in the Nuit de dicembre, written about twelve 
months after the journey to Italy, referred not to George 
Sand but to another and quite a different woman. The story 
of the Italian journey and its results are told under the guise 
of fiction from two points of view in the two volumes called 
respectively Elle et ltd by George Sand, and Lui et elle by 
Paul de Musset. As to the permanent effect on Alfred de 
Musset, whose irresponsible gaiety was killed by the breaking 
off of the connexion, there can be no doubt. 

During Musset's absence in Italy Fantasio was published in the 
Revue, Lorenzaccio is said to have been written at Venice, and 
not long after his return On ne badine pas avec V amour was written 
and published in the Revue, In 1835 he produced Lucie, La Nuit 
de mat, La Quenouille de Barberine, Le Chandelier, La Loi sur la 
presse, La Nuit de dtcembre, and La Confession d'un enfant du 
Steele, wherein is contained what is probably a true account of 
Musset's relations with George Sand. The Confession is excep- 
tionally interesting as exhibiting the poet's frame of mind at 
the time, and the approach to a revulsion from the Bonapartist 
ideas amid which he had been brought up in his childhood. To 
the supreme power of Napoleon he in this work attributed that 
moral sickness of the time which he described. " One man," 
he wrote, " absorbed the whole life of Europe; the rest of the 
human race struggled to fill their lungs with the air that he had 
breathed." When the emperor fell, " a ruined world was a 
resting-place for a generation weighted with care." The Con- 
fession is further important, apart from its high literary merit, 
as exhibiting in many passages the poet's tendency to shun or 
wildly protest against all that is disagreeable or difficult in human 
life — a tendency to which, however, much of his finest work was 
due. To 1836 belong the Nuit aVaoftt, the Lettre & Lamartine, 
the Stances & la Malibran, the comedy II ne faut jurer de rien, 
and the beginning of the brilliant letters of Dupuis and Cotonet 
on romanticism. // ne f out jurer de rien is as typical of Musset's 
comedy work as is Les Caprices de Marianne of the work in which 
a terrible fatality underlies the brilliant dialogue and keen 
polished characterization. In 1837 was published Un Caprice, 
which afterwards found its way to the Paris stage by a curious 
road. Mme Allan-Despreaux, the actress, heard of it in 
St Petersburg as a Russian piece. On asking for a French 
translation of the play she received the volume Comidies et 
proverbes reprinted from the Revue des deux mondes. In 1837 
appeared also some of the Nouvelles. In 1839 Musset began a 
romance called Le Pohte dtchu, of which the existing fragments 
are full of passion and insight. In 1840 he passed through a 
period of feeling that the public did not recognize his genius — 
as, indeed, they did not — and wrote a very short but very 
striking series of reflections headed with the words "A trente 
ans," which Paul de Musset published in his Life, In 1841 
there came out in the Revue de Paris Musset's " Le Rhin alle- 
mand," an answer to Becker's poem which appeared in the 
Revue des deux mondes. This fine war-song made a great deal 
of noise, and brought to the poet quantities of challenges from 
German officers. Between this date and 1845 he wrote comparar 
tively little. In the last named year the charming " proverbe " 
II faut qu'itne porte soil ouverte ou fermie appeared. In 1847 



MUSSOORIE— MUSTARD

Un Caprice was produced at the Theatre Francais, and the 
employment in it of such a word as " rebonsoir " shocked some 
of the old school. But the success of the piece was immediate 
and marked. It increased Musset's reputation with the public 
in a degree out of proportion t to its intrinsic importance; 
and indeed freed him from the burden of depression caused by 
want of appreciation. In 1848 11 ne faut jurer de Hen was 
played at the Theatre Francais and the Chandelier at the Theatre 
Historique. Between this date and 1851 . Bettine was pro- 
duced on the stage and Carmosine written; and between this 
time and the date of his death, from an affection of the heart, 
on the 2nd of May 1857, the poet produced no large work of 
importance. 

Alfred de Musset now holds the place which Sainte-Beuve 
first accorded, then denied, and then again accorded to him — 
as a poet of the first rank. He had genius, though not genius 
of that strongest kind which its possessor can always keep in 
check. His own character worked both for and against his 
success as a writer. He inspired a strong personal affection in 
his contemporaries. His very weakness and his own conscious- 
ness of it produced such beautiful work as, to take one instance, 
the Nuit d'octobre. His Nouvelles are extraordinarily brilliant; 
his poems are charged with passion, fancy and fine satiric power; 
in his plays he hit upon a method of his own, in which no one 
has dared or availed to follow him with any closeness. He 
was one of the first, most original, and in the end most successful 
of the first-rate writers included in the phrase " the 1830 period." 
The wilder side of his life has probably been exaggerated; and 
his brother Paul de Musset has given in his Biographie a striking 
testimony to the finer side of his character. In the later years 
of his life Musset was elected, not without opposition, a member 
of the French Academy. Besides the works above referred to, 
the Nouvelles et conies and the (Euvres posthumes, in which 
there is much of interest concerning the great tragic actress 
Rachel, should be specially mentioned. 

The biography of Alfred de Musset by his brother Paul, partial 
as it naturally is, is of g[reat value. Alfred de Musset has afforded, 
matter for many appreciations, and among these in English may be 
mentioned the sketch (1890) of C. F. Oliphant and the essay (1855) 
of F. T. Palgrave. See also the monograph by Arvdde Banne 
(Madame Vincens) in the " Grands ecrivains francais" series. 
Musset 's correspondence with George Sand was published intact for 
the first time in 1904. 

A monument to Alfred de Musset by Antonin Mercie\ presented 
by M. Osiris, and erected on the Place du Theatre Francais, was 
duly " inaugurated " on the 24th of February 1906. The ceremony 
took place in the vestibule of the theatre, where speeches were 
delivered by Jules Claretie, Francois Coppee and others, and 
Mounet-Sully recited a poem, written for the occasion by Maurice 
Magre. (W. H. P.) 

MUSSOORIE, or Masuri, a town and sanitarium of British 
India, in the Dehra Dun district of the United Provinces, about 
6600 ft. above the sea. Pop. (1901), 6461, rising to 15,000 in the 
hot season. It stands on a ridge of one of the lower Himalayan 
ranges, amid beautiful mountain scenery, and forms with 
Naini Tal the chief summer resort for European residents in the 
plains of the United Provinces. The view from Mussoorie 
over the valley of the Dun and across the Siwalik hills to the 
plains is very beautiful, as also is the view towards the north, 
which is bounded by the peaks of the snowy range. Mussoorie 
practically forms one station with Landaur, the convalescent 
depot for European troops, 7362 ft. above the sea. Some 
distance off, on the road to Simla, is the cantonment of Chakrata, 
7300 ft. It was formerly approached by road from Saharanpur 
in the plains, 58 m. distant, but in 1900 the railway was opened 
to Dehra, 21 m. by road. There are numerous schools for 
Europeans, including St George's college, the Philander-Smith 
institute, the Oak Grove school of the East Indian railway, and 
several Church of England and Roman Catholic institutions, 
together with a cathedral of the latter faith. The first brewery 
in India was established here in 1850. The town has botanical 
gardens, and is the summer headquarters of the Trigonometrical 
Survey. 

MUSTAFA RESHID PASHA (1800-1858), Turkish statesman 
and diplomatist, was born at Constantinople in 1800. He 
xix. 4 



entered the public service at an early age and rose rapidly, 
becoming ambassador at Paris in 1834 and in London 1836, 
minister for foreign affairs 1837, again ambassador in London 
1838, and in Paris 1841. Appointed vali of Adrianople in 
1843, he returned as ambassador to Paris in the same year. 
Between 1845 and 1857 he was six times grand vizier. One of 
the greatest and most brilliant statesmen of his time, thoroughly 
acquainted with European politics, and well versed in affairs, 
he was a convinced if somewhat too ardent partisan of reform 
and the principal author of the legislative remodelling of Turkish 
administrative methods known as the Tanzimat. His ability 
was recognized alike by friend and by foe. In the settlement 
of the Egyptian question in 1840, and during the Crimean War 
and the ensuing peace negotiations, he rendered valuable services 
to the state. 

MUSTANG, the wild or semi-wild horse of the prairies of 
America, the descendant of the horses imported by the Spaniards 
after the conquest in the 16th century (see Horse). The word 
appears to be due to two Spanish words, mestrenco, or mostrenco, 
defined by Minsheu (1599) as "a strayer. " Mestrenco (now 
mesteno) means " wild, having no master," and appears to be 
derived from mesta, a grazier-association, which among other 
functions appropriated any wild cattle found with the herds. 

MUSTARD. The varieties of mustard-seed of commerce are 
produced from several species of the genus Brassica (a member 
of the natural order Cruciferae). Of these the principal are the 
black or brown mustard, Brassica nigra (Sinapis nigra), the 
white mustard, Brassica alba, and the Sarepta mustard, B. 
juncea. Both the white and black mustards are cultivated 
to some extent in various parts of England. The white is to 
be found in every garden as a salad plant; but it has come into 
increasing favour as a forage crop for sheep, and as a green 
manure, for which purpose it is ploughed down when about to 
come into flower. The black mustard is grown solely for its 
seeds, which yield the well-known condiment. The name of the 
condiment was in French moustarde, mod. moutarde, as being made 
of the seeds of the plant pounded and mixed with must (Lat. 
mustum, i.e. unfermented wine). 1 The word was thus transferred 
to the plant itself. When white mustard is cultivated for its 
herbage it is sown usually in July or August, after some early 
crop has been removed. The land being brought into a fine 
tilth, the seed, at the rate of 12 lb per acre, is sown broadcast, 
and covered in the way recommended for clover seeds. In 
about six weeks it is ready either for feeding off by sheep or for 
ploughing down as a preparative for wheat or barley. White 
mustard is not fastidious in regard to soil. When grown for 
a seed crop it is treated in the way about to be described for the 
other variety. For this purpose either kind requires a fertile 
soil, as it is an exhausting crop. The seed is sown in April, 
is once hoed in May, and requires no further culture. As soon as 
the pods have assumed a brown colour the crop is reaped and 
laid down in handfuls, which he until dry enough for thrashing 
or stacking. In removing it from the ground it must be handled 
with great care, and carried to the thrashing-floor or stack on 
cloths, to avoid the loss of seed. The price depends much on 
its being saved in dry weather, as the quality suffers much 
from wet. This great evil attends its growth, that the seeds 
which are unavoidably shed in harvesting the crop remain in the 
soil, and stock it permanently with what proves a pestilent weed 
amongst future crops. 

White mustard is used as a small salad — generally accompanied 
by garden cress — while still in the seed leaf. To keep up a 
supply the seed should be sown every week or ten days. The 
sowings in the open ground may be made from March till October, 
earlier or later according to the season. The ground should 
be light and rich, and the situation warm and sheltered. Sow 
thickly in rows 6 in. apart, and slightly cover the seed, pressing 
the surface smooth with the back of the spade. When gathering 
the crop, cut the young plants off even with the ground, or pull 

1 There were two kinds of^ mustum, one the best for keeping, 
produced after the first treading of the grapes, and called mustum 
lixivum; the other, mustum tortivum, obtained from the mass of 
trodden grapes by the wine-press, was used for inferior purposes.

them up and cut off the roots, beginning at one end of a row. 
From October to March the seeds should be sown thickly in 
shallow boxes and placed in a warm house or frame, with a 
temperature not below 65 . 

Brassica nigra occurs as a weed in waste and cultivated ground 
throughout England and the south of Scotland, but is a doubtful 
native. It is a large branching annual 2 to 3 ft. high with stiff, 
rather rough, stem and branches, dark green leaves ranging from 
lyrate below to lanceolate above, short racemes of small bright 
yellow flowers one-third of an inch in diameter and narrow 
smooth pods. B. alba is more restricted to cultivated ground and 
has still less claim to be considered a native of Great Britain; 
it is distinguished from black mustard by its smaller size, larger 
flowers and seeds, and spreading rough hairy pods with a long 
curved beak. 

The peculiar pungency and odour to which mustard owes much of 
its value are due to an essential oil developed by the action of water 
on two peculiar chemical substances contained in the black seed. 
These bodies are a glucoside^ termed by its discoverers myronate of 
potassium, but since called sinigrin, CioHmKNSaOio, and an albumi- 
noid body, myrosin. The latter substance in presence of water 
acts as a ferment on sinigrin, splitting it up into the essential oil of 
mustard, a potassium salt, and sugar. It is worthy of remark that 
this reaction does not take place in presence of boiling water, and 
therefore it is not proper to use very hot water (above 120 F.) in 
the preparation of mustard. The explanation is that myrosin is 
decomposed by water above thistemperature.^ Essential oil of 
mustard is in chemical constitution an isothiocyanate of allyl 
CjHjNCS. It is prepared artificially by a process, discovered by 
Zinzin, which consists in treating bromide of allyl with thiocyanate 
of ammonium and distilling the resultant thiocyanate of allyl. The 
seed of white mustard contains in place of sinigrin a peculiar gluco- 
side called sinalbin, C30H44N2S2O16, in several aspects analogous to 
sinigrin. In presence of water it is acted upon by myrosin, 
present also in white mustard, splitting it up into acrinyl isothio- 
cyanate, sulphate of sinapin and glucose. The first of these is a 
powerful rubefacient, whence white mustard, although yielding 
no volatile oil, forms a valuable material for plasters. The seeds 
of Brassica juncea have the same constitution and properties as black 
mustard, as a substitute for which they are extensively cultivated 
in southern Russia; the plant is also cultivated abundantly in India. 

Both as a table condiment and as a medicinal substance, mustard 
has been known from a very remote period. Under the name of 
vairv it was used by Hippocrates inmedicinc. The form in which 
table mustard is now sold in the United Kingdom dates from 1720, 
about which time Mrs Clements of Durham hit on the idea of grinding 
the seed in a mill and sifting the flour from the husk. The bright 
yellow farina thereby produced under the name of " Durham 
mustard " pleased the taste of George I., and rapidly attained wide 
popularity. As it is now prepared mustard consists essentially of 
a mixture of black and white farina in certain proportions. Several 
grades of pure mustard arc made containing nothing but the farina 
of mustard-seed, the lower qualities having larger amounts of the 
white cheaper mustard; and corresponding grades of a mixed 
preparation of equal price, but containing certain proportions of 
wheaten or starch flour, are also prepared and sold as " mustard 
condiment." The mixture is free from the unmitigated bitterness 
and sharpness of flavour of pure mustard, and it keeps much better. 

The volatile oil distilled from black mustard seeds after maceration 
with water is official in the British Pharmacopeia under the title 
Oleum sinapis volatile. It is a yellowish or colourless pungent 
liquid, soluble only in about fifty parts of water, but readily so in 
ether and in alcohol. From it is prepared, with camphor, castor 
oil and alcohol, the linimentum sinapis. The official sinapis consists 
of black and white mustard seeds powdered and mixed. The advan- 
tage of mixture depends upon the fact that the white mustard seeds 
have an excess of the ferment myrosin, and the black, whilst some- 
what deficient in myrosin, yield a volatile body as compared with the 
fixed product of the white mustard seeds. From this mixture is 
prepared the cltarta sinapis, which consists of cartridge paper covered 
with a^ mixture of the powder and the liquor caoutchouc, the fixed 
oil having first been removed by benzol, thus rendering the glucoside 
capable of being more easily decomposed by the ferment. 

Used internally as a condiment, mustard stimulates the salivary 
but not the gastric secretions. It increases the peristaltic move- 
ments of thestomach very markedly. One drachm to half an ounce 
of mustard in a tumblerful of warm water is an efficient emetic, 
acting directly upon the gastric sensory nerves, long before any of 
the drug could be absorbed so as to reach the emetic centre in the 
medulla oblongata. The heart and respiration are reflexly stimu- 
lated, mustard being thus the only stimulant emetic. Some few other 
emetics act without any appreciable depression, but in cases of 

Coisoning with respiratory or cardiac failure mustard should never 
e forgotten. In contrast to this may be mentioned, amongst the 
external therapeutic applications of mustard, its frequent power of 
relieving vomiting when locally applied to the epigastrium. 



The uses of mustard leaves in the treatment of local pains are 
well known. When a marked counter-irritant action is needed, 
mustard is often preferable to cantharides in being more manageable 
and in causing a less degree of vesication; but the cutaneous damage 
done by mustard usually takes longer to heal. A mustard sitz 
bath will often hasten and alleviate the initial stage of menstruation, 
and is sometimes used to expedite the appearance of the eruption 
in measles and scarlatina. The domestic remedy of hot water and 
mustard for children's feet in cases of cold or threatened cold may 
be of somfe use in drawing the blood to the surface and thus tending 
to prevent an excessive vascular dilatation in the nose or bronchi. 
The proportion of an ounce of mustard to a gallon of water is a fair 
one and easily remembered. But by far the most important 
therapeutic application of mustard is as a unique emetic. 

MUSTARD OILS, organic chemical compounds of general 
formula R-NCS. They may be prepared by the action of 
carbon bisulphide on primary amines in alcoholic or ethereal 
solution, the alkyl dithio-carbamic compounds formed being 
then precipitated with mercuric chloride, and the mercuric 
salts heated in aqueous solution, 

2R-NH 2 < ^CS^^ R H ^ 2 [RHNCS 2 ] 2 Hg-^HgS-fH 2 S+2RNCS; 

or the isocyanic esters may be heated with phosphorus penta- 
sulphide (A. Michael and G. Palmer, Amer. Chem. Jour. } 1884, 
6, 257). They are colourless liquids with a very pungent irritating 
odour. They are readily oxidized, with production of the corre- 
sponding amine. Nascent hydrogen converts them into the 
amine, with simultaneous formation of thio-formaldehyde, 
RNCS+4H = R-NH 2 +HCSH. When heated with acids to 
ioo° C, they decompose with formation of the amine and libera- 
tion of carbon bisulphide and sulphuretted hydrogen. They 
combine directly with alcohols, mercaptans, ammonia, amines 
and with aldehyde ammonia. 

Methyl mustard oil } CH 8 NCS, melts at 35 C.and boils at 119 C. 
Allyl mustard oil, C3H5NCS, is the principal constituent of the 
ordinary mustard oil obtained on distilling black mustard seeds. 
These seeds contain potassium myronate (CioH^NSaOioK) which in 
presence of water is hydrolysed by the myrosin present in the seed, 

C,oH 18 NS 2 10 K = C«H 12 q 6 -|-KHS04+C3H6NCS. 
It may also be prepared by heating allyl sulphide with potassium 
sulphocyanide. It is a colourless liquid boiling at 150*7° C. It 
combines directly with potassium bisulphite. Phenyl mustard oil t 
QHjNCS, is obtained by boiling sulphocarbanilide with concentrated 
hydrochloric acid, some triphenylguanidine being formed at the same 
time. It is a colourless liquid boiling at 222 C. When heated 
with copper powder it yields benzohitrile. 

MUSTER (Mid. Eng. tnostre, mouslre, adapted from the similar 
O. Fr. forms; Lat. monstrare), originally an exhibition, show, 
review, an exhibition of strength, prowess or power. One of 
the meanings of this common Romanic word, viz. pattern, 
sample, is only used in commercial usage in English (e.g. in 
the cutlery trade), but it has passed into Teutonic languages, 
Ger. Muster j Du. monster. The most general meaning is for the 
assembling of soldiers and sailors for inspection and review, and 
more particularly for the ascertainment and verification of the 
numbers on the roll. This use is seen in the Med. Lat. monstrum 
and monstratio, u recensio militum" (Du Cange, Gloss, s.v.). In 
the "enlistment" system of army organization during the 
16th and 17th centuries, and later in certain special survivals, 
each regiment was " enlisted " by its colonel and reviewed 
by special officers, " muster-masters," who vouched for the 
members on the pay roll of the regiment representing its 
actual strength. This was a necessary precaution in the days 
when it was in the power of the commander of a unit to fill 
the muster roll with the names of fictitious men, known in the 
military slang of France and England as passe-volants and 
"faggots" respectively. The chief officer at headquarters 
was the muster-master-general, later commissary general of 
musters. In the United States the term is still commonly 
used, and a soldier is " mustered out " when he is officially 
discharged from military service. 

MUSURUS, MARCUS (c. 1470-1517), Greek scholar, was 
born at Rhithymna (Retimo) in Crete. At an early age he 
became a pupil of John Lascaris at Venice. In 1505 he was 
made professor of Greek at Padua, but when the university 
was closed in 1509 during the war of the league of Cambrai he

returned to Venice, where he filled a similar post. In 1516 he 
was summoned to Rome by Leo X., who appointed him arch- 
bishop of Monemvasia (Malvasia) in the Peloponnese, but he died 
before he left Italy. Since 1493 Musurus had been associated 
with the famous printer Aldus Manutius, and belonged to 
the "Neacademia," a society founded by Manutius and other 
learned men for the promotion of Greek studies. Many of the 
Aldine classics were brought out under Musurus's supervision, 
and he is credited with the first editions of the scholia of Aristo- 
phanes (1498), Athenaeus (1514), Hesychius (1514), Pausanias 
(1516). 

See R. Menge^ De M. Musuri vita studiis ingenio, in vol. 5 of 
M. Schmidt's edition of Hesychius (1868). 

MUTE (Lat. mutus, dumb), silent or incapable of speech. For 
the human physical incapacity see Deaf and Dumb. In 
phonetics (q.v.) a "mute" letter is one which (like p or g) repre- 
sents no individual sound. The name of "mutes" is given, for 
obvious reasons, to the undertaker's assistants at a funeral. In 
music a "mute" (Ital. sordino, from Lat. surdus, deaf) is a device 
for deadening the sound in an instrument by checking its vibra- 
tions. Its use is marked by the sign c.s. (con sordino), and its 
cessation by s.s. (senza sordino). In the case of the violin and 
other stringed instruments this object is attained by the use of a 
piece of brass, wood or ivory, so shaped as to fit on the bridge 
without touching the strings and hold it so tightly as to deaden 
or muffle the vibrations. In the case of brass wind instruments 
a leather, wooden or papier mache pad in the shape of a pear 
with a hole through it is placed in the bell of the instrument, 
by which the passage of the sound is impeded. The interference 
with the pitch of the instruments has led to the invention of 
elaborately constructed mutes. Players on the horn and 
trumpet frequently use the left hand as a mute. Drums are 
muted or "muffled" either by the pressure of the hand on the 
head, or by covering with cloth. In the side drum this is effected 
by the insertion of pieces of cloth between the membrane and the 
"snares," or by loosening the "snares." The muting of a 
pianoforte is obtained by the use of the soft-pedal. 

MUTIAN, KONRAD (1471-1526), German humanist, was 
born in Homberg on the 15th of October 147 1 of well-to-do 
parents named Mut, and was subsequently known as Konrad 
Mutianus Rufus, from his red hair. At Deventer under Alex- 
ander Hegiushehad Erasmus as schoolfellow ;proceeding( i486) to 
the university of Erfurt, he took the master's degree in 1492. 
From 1495 he travelled in Italy, taking the doctor's degree 
in canon law at Bologna. Returning in 1502, the landgraf of 
Hesse promoted him to high office. The post was not congenial; 
he resigned it (1503) for a small salary as canonicus in Gotha. 
Mutian was a man of great influence in a select circle especially 
connected with the university of Erfurt, and known as the 
Mutianiscker Bund, which included Eoban Hess, Crotus 
Rubeanus, Justus Jonas and other leaders of independent 
thought. He had no public ambition; except in correspondence, 
and as an epigrammatist, he was no writer, but he furnished 
ideas to those who wrote. He may deserve the title which has 
been given him as "precursor of the Reformation," in so far as he 
desired the reform of the Church, but not the establishment 
of a rival. Like Erasmus, he was with Luther in his early 
stage, but deserted him in his later development. Though he 
had personally no hand in it, the Epistolae obscurorum virorum 
(due especially to Crotus Rubeanus) was the outcome of the 
Reuchlinists in his Bund. He died at Gotha on the 30th of 
March (Good Friday) 1526.

MUTILATION (from Lat. mutilus, maimed). The wounding, 
maiming and disfiguring of the body is a practice common 
among savages and systematically pursued by many entire races. 
The varieties of mutilation are as numerous as the instances of 
it are widespread. Nearly every part of the body is the object 
of mutilation, and nearly every motive common to human 



beings — vanity, religion, affection, prudence — has acted in 
giving rise to what has been proved to be a custom of great 
antiquity. Some forms, such as tattooing and depilation, 
have stayed on as practices even after civilization has banished 
the more brutal types; and a curious fact is that analogous 
mutilations are found observed by races separated by vast 
distances, and proved to have had no relations with one another, 
at any rate in historic times. Ethnical mutilations have in 
certain races a great sociological value. It is only after sub- 
mission to some such operation that the youth is admitted to 
full tribal rights (see Initiation). Tattooing, too, has a semi- 
religious importance, as when an individual bears a representa- 
tion of his totem on his body; and many mutilations are tribe 
marks, or brands used to know slaves. 

Mutilations may be divided into: (1) those of the skin; (2) of the 
face and head; (3) of the body and limbs; (4) of the teeth ; (5) of the 
sexual organs. 

1, The principal form of skin-mutilation is tattooing (q.v.), the 
ethnical importance of which is very great. A practice almost as 
common is depilation, or removal of hair. This is either by means 
of the razor, e.g. in Japan, by depilatories, or by tearing out the hairs 
separately, as among most savage peoples. The parts thus mutilated 
are usually the eyebrows, the face, the scalp and the pubic regions. 
Many African natives tear out all the body hair, some among them 
(e.g. the Bongos) using special pincers. Depilation is common, too, 
in the South Sea Islands. The Andaman islanders and the Boto- 
cudos of Brazil shave the body, using shell-edges and other primitive 
instruments. 

2. Mutilations of the face and head are usually restricted to the 
lips, ears, nose and cheeks. The lips are simply perforated or 
distended to an extraordinary degree. The Botocudos insert disks 
of wood into the lower lip. Lip-mutilations are common in North 
America, too, on the Mackenzie river and among the Aleutians. 
In Africa they are frequently practised. The Manganja women 
pierce the upper lips and introduce small metal shields or rings. 
The Mittu women bore the lower lip and thrust a wooden peg through. 
In other tribes little sticks of rock crystal are pushed through, 
which jingle together as the wearer "talks. The women of Senegal 
increase the natural thickness of the upper lip by pricking it rcpeat- 
edly^ until it is permanently inflamed and swollen. The ear, and 
particularly the lobe, is almost universally mutilated, from the ear- 
rings of the civilized West to the wooden disks of the Botocudos. 
The only peoples who are said not to wear any form of ear ornament 
are the Andaman islanders, the Neddahs, the Bushmen, the Fuegians 
and certain tribes of Sumatra. Ear mutilation in its most exag- 
gerated form is practised in Indo-China by the Mois of Annam and 
the Penangs of Cambodia, and in Borneo by the Dyaks. They 
extend the lobe by the insertion of wooden disks, and by metal 
rings and weights, until it sometimes reaches the shoulder. In 
Africa and Asia earrings sometimes weigh nearly half a pound. 
Livingstone said that the natives of the Zambesi distend the per- 
foration in the lobe to such a degree that the hand closed could be 
passed through. The Monbuttus thrust through a^ perforation in 
the body of the ear rolls of leaves, or of leather, or cigarettes. The 
Papuans, the inhabitants of the New Hebrides, and most Melanesian 
peoples carry all sorts of things in their ears, the New Caledonians 
using them as pipe-racks. Many races disfigure the nose with 
perforations. The young dandies of New Guinea bore holes through 
the septum and thrust through pieces of bone or flowers, a mutilation 
found, too, among^ New Zealanders, Australians, New Caledonians 
and other Polynesian races. In Africa the Bagas and Bongos hang 
metal rings and buckles on their noses; the Aleutians cords, bits 
of metal or amber. In women it is the side of the nose which is 
usually perforated; rings and jewelled pendants (as among Indian 
and Arabic women, the ancient Egyptians and Jews), or feathers, 
flowers, coral, &c. (as in Polynesia), being hung there. Only one 
side of the nose is usually perforated, and this is not always merely 
decorative. It may denote social position, as among the Ababdes 
in Africa, whose unmarried girls wear no rings in their noses. The 
male Kulus of the Himalaya wear a large ring in the left nostril. 
Malays and Polynesians sometimes deform the nose by enlarging 
its base, effecting this by compression of the nasal bones of the 
newly born. 

The cheeks are not so frequently mutilated. The people of the 
Aleutian and Kurile Islands bore holes through their checks and 
place in them the long hairs from the muzzles of seals. The Guaranis 
of South America wear feathers in the same manner. In some 
countries the top of the head or the skin behind the ears of children 
is burnt to preserve them from sickness, traces of which mutilation 
are said to be discoverable on some neolithic skulls; while some 
African tribes cut and prick the neck close to the ear. By many 
peoples the deformation of the skull was anciently practised. 
Herodotus, Hippocrates and Strabo mention such a custom among 
peoples of the Caspian and Crimea. Later similar practices were 
found existing among Chinese mendicant sects, some tribes of 
Turkestan, the Japanese priesthood, in Malaysia, Sumatra, Java and

the south seas. In Europe it was not unknown. But the discovery 
of America brought to our knowledge those races which made a fine 
art of skull-deformities. At the present day the custom is still 
observed by the Haidas and Chinooks, and by certain tribes of Peru 
and on the Amazon, by the Kurds of Armenia, by certain Malay 
peoples, in the Solomon Islands and the New Hebrides. The 
reasons for this type of mutilation are uncertain. Probably the idea 
of distinguishing themselves from lower races was predominant in 
most cases, as for example in that of the Chinook Indians, who 
deformed the skull to distinguish themselves from their slaves. 
Or it may have been through a desire to give a ferocious appearance 
to their warriors. The deformation was always done at infancy, 
and often in the ease of both sexes. It was, however, more usually 
reserved for boys, and sometimes for a single caste, as at Tahiti. 
Different methods prevailed: by bands, bandages, boards, com- 
presses of clay and sandbags, a continued pressure was applied to 
the half-formed cranial bones to give them the desired shape. 
Hand -kneading may also possibly have been employed. 

3. Mutilations of the body or limbs by maiming, lopping off or 
deforming, are far from rare. Certain races (Bushmen, Kaffirs 
and Hottentots) cut off the finger joints as a sign of mourning, 
especially for parents. The Tongans do the same, in the belief that 
the evil spirits which bring diseases into the body would escape by 
the wound. Diseased children are thus mutilated by them. Con- 
tempt for female timidity has caused a curious custom among the 
Galfas (Africa). They amputate the mammae of boys soon after 
birth, believing no warrior can possibly be brave who possesses 
them. The fashion of distorting the feet of Chinese ladies of high 
rank has been of long continuance and only recently prohibited. 

4. Mutilations of the teeth are among the most common and the 
most varied. They are by breaking, extracting, filing, inlaying or 
cutting away the crown of the teeth. Nearly every variety of dental 
mutilation is met with in Africa. In a tribe north-east of the Albert 
Nyanza it is usual to pry out with a piece of metal the four lower 
incisors in children of both sexes. The women of certain tribes on 
the Senegal force the growth of the upper incisors outwards so as 
to make them project beyond the lower lips. Many of the aboriginal 
tribes of Australia extractteeth, and at puberty the Australian boys 
have a tooth knocked out. The Eskimos of the Mackenzie River 
cut down the crown of the upper incisors so as not to resemble dogs. 
Some Malay races, too, are said to blacken their teeth because dogs 
have white teeth. This desire to be unlike animals seems to be at 
the bottom of many dental mutilations. Another reason is the wish 
to distinguish tribe from tribe. Thus some Papuans break their 
teeth in order to be unlike other Papuan tribes which they despise. 
In this way such practices become traditional. Finally, like many 
mutilations, those of the teeth are trials of endurance of physical 
pain, and take place at ceremonies of initiation and at puberty. 
The Mois (Sriengs) of Cochin-China break the two upper middle 
incisors with a flint. This is always ceremoniously done at puberty 
to the accompaniment of feasting and prayers for those mutilated, 
who' will thus, it is thought, be preserved from sickness. Among 
Malay races the filing of teeth takes place with similar ceremony at 
puberty. In Java, Sumatra and Borneo the incisors are thinned 
down and shortened. Deep transverse grooves are also made with a 
file, a stone, bamboo or sand, and the teeth filed to a point. The 
Dyaks of Borneo make a small hole in the transverse groove and 
insert a pin of brass, which is hammered to a nail-head shape in the 
hollow, or they inlay the teeth with gold and other metals. The 
ancient Mexicans also inlaid the teeth with precious stones, 

5. Mutilations of the sexual organs are more ethnically important 
than any. They have played a great part in human history, and 
still have much significance in many countries. Their antiquity 
is undoubtedly great, and nearly all originate with the idea of 
initiation into full sexual life. The most important, circumcision 
(q.v.), has been transformed into a religious rite, Infibulation 
(Lat. fibula, a clasp), or the attaching a ring, clasp, or buckle to the 
sexual organs, in females through the labia majora, in males through 
the prepuce, was an operation to preserve chastity very commonly 
practised in antiquity. At Rome it was in use; Strabo says it was 
prevalent in Arabia and in Egypt, and it is still native to those regions 
(Lane, Modern Egyptians, i. 73; Arabic Lexicon, s.v. " hafaaa"). 
Niebuhr heard that it was practised on both shores of the Persian 
Gulf and at Bagdad (Description de V Arabic, p. 70), It is common in 
Africa (see Sir H. H. Johnston. Kilimanjaro Expedition, 1886), but 
is there often replaced by an operation which consists in stitching 
the labia majora together when the girl is four or five years old. 
Castration is practised in the East to supply guards for harems, and 
was employed in Italy until the time of Pope Leo XI I L to provide 
" soprani ' for the papal choir; it has also been voluntarily submitted 
to from religious motives (see Eunuch), The operation has, 
however, been resorted to for other purposes. Thus in Africa it is 
said to have been used as a means of annihilating conquered tribes. 
The Hottentots and Bushmen, too, have the curious custom of 
removing one testicle when a boy is eight or nine years old, in the 
belief that this partial emasculation renders the victim fleeter of 
foot for the chase. # The most dreadful of these mutilations is that 
practised by certain Australian tribes on their boys. It consists 
of cutting open and leaving exposed the whole length of the urethral 
canal and thus rendering sexual intercourse impossible. According 



to some authorities it is hatred of the white man and dread of slavery 
which are the reasons of this racial suicide. Among the Dyaks and 
in many of the Melanesian islands curious modes of ornamentation 
of the organs (such as the kalang) prevail, which are in the nature of 
mutilations. 

Penal Use. — Mutilation as a method of punishment was common 
in the criminal law 6t many ancient nations. In the earliest laws of 
England mutilation, maiming and dismemberment had a prominent 
place. " Men branded on the forehead, without hands, feet, or 
tongues, lived as examples of the danger which attended the com- 
mission of petty crimes and as a warning to all churls " (Pike's 
History of Crime in England, 1873). The Danes were more severe 
than the Saxons. Under their rules eyes were plucked out; noses, 
ears and upper lips cut off; scalps town away; and sometimes the 
whole body flayed alive. The earliest forest-laws of which there 
is record are those of Canute (1016). Under these, if a freedman 
offered violence to a keeper of the king's deer he was liable to lose 
freedom and property ; if a serf, he lost his right hand, and on a second 
offence was to die. One who killed a deer was either to have his 
eyes put out or lose his life. Under the first two Norman kings 
mutilation was the punishment for poaching. It was, however, not 
reserved for that, as during the reign of Henry I. some coiners were 
taken to Winchester, where their right hands were lopped off and 
they were castrated. Under the kings of the West Saxon dynasty 
the loss of hands had been a common penalty for coining (The 
Obsolete Punishments of Shropshire, by S. Meeson Morris). Morris 
auotes a case in John's reign at the Salop Assizes in 1203, where one 
Alice Crithecreche and others were accused of murdering an old 
woman at Lilleshall. Convicted of being accessory, Crithecreche 
was sentenced to death, but the penalty was altered to that of 
having her eyes plucked out. During the Tudor and Stuart periods 
mutilations were a common form of punishment extrajudicially 
inflicted by order of the privy council and the Star Chamber, .There 
are said to be preserved at Playford Hall, Ipswich, instruments of 
Henry VIII.'s time for cutting off ears. This penalty appears to 
have been inflicted for not attending church. By an act of Henry 
VIII. (33. Hen. VIII. c. 12) the punishment for "striking in the 
king's court or house " was the loss of the right hand. For writing a 
tract on The Monstrous Regimen of Women a Nonconformist divine 
(Dr W. Stubbs) had his right hand lopped off. Among many cases 
of severe mutilations during Stuart times may be mentioned those 
of Prynne, Burton, Bastwick and Titus Oates. 

MUTINY (from an old verb " mutine," O. Fr. mutin f meutin, 
a sedition; cf. mod. Fr. Entente; the original is the Late Lat. 
mota, commotion, from movere, to move), a resistance by force 
to recognized authority, an insurrection, especially applied to 
a sedition in any military or naval forces of the state. Such 
offences are dealt with by courts-martial. (See Military Law 
and Court Martial.) 

MUTSU, MUNEMITSU, Count (1842-1896), Japanese states- 
man, was born in 1842 in Wakayama. A vehement opponent 
of " clan government "—that is, usurpation of administrative 
posts by men of two or three fiefs, an abuse which threatened 
to follow the overthrow of the Tokugawa shogunate — he con- 
spired to assist Saigo's rebellion and was imprisoned from 1878 
until 1883. While in prison he translated Bentham's Utilitarian- 
ism. In 1886, after a visit to Europe, he received a diplomatic 
appointment, and held the portfolio of foreign affairs during 
the China-Japan War (1894-95), being associated with Prince 
(then Count) Ito as peace plenipotentiary. He negotiated 
the first of the revised treaties (that with Great Britain), and 
for these various services he received the title of count. He 
died in Tokyo in 1896. His statue in bronze stands before the 
foreign office in Tokyo. 

MUTSU HITO, Mikado, or Emperor, of Japan (1852- ), 
was born on the 3rd of November 1852, succeeded his father, 
Osahito, the former emperor, in January 1867, and was crowned 
at Osaka on the 31st of October 1868. The country was then 
in a ferment owing to the concessions which had been granted 
to foreigners by the preceding shGgun Iyemochi, who in 1854 
concluded a treaty with Commodore Perry by which it was 
agreed that certain ports should be open to foreign trade. 
This convention gave great offence to the more conservative 
daimios, and on their initiative the mikado suddenly decided 
to abolish the shogunate. This resolution was not carried out 
without strong opposition. The reigning shogun, Keiki, yielded 
to the decree, but many of his followers were not so complaisant, 
and it was only by force of arms that the new order of things 
was imposed on the country. The main object of those who 
had advocated the change was to lead to a reversion to the 



MUTTRA 



101 



primitive condition of affairs, when the will of the mikado was 
absolute and when the presence in Japan of the hated foreigner 
was unknown. But the reactionary party was not to be allowed 
to monopolize revolutions. To their surprise and discomfiture, 
the powerful daimios of Satsuma and Choshu suddenly declared 
themselves to be in favour of opening the country to foreign 
intercourse, and of adopting many far-reaching reforms. With 
this movement Mutsu Hito was cordially in agreement, and of 
his own motion he invited the foreign representatives to an 
audience on the 23rd of March 1868. As Sir Harry Parkes, 
the British minister, was on his way to this assembly, he was 
attacked by a number of two-sworded samurai, who, but for 
his guard, would doubtless have succeeded in assassinating 
him. The outrage was regarded by the emperor and his minis- 
ters as a reflection on their honour, and they readily made all 
reparation within their power. While these agitations were 
afoot, the emperor, with his advisers, was maturing a political 
constitution which was to pave the way to the assumption by 
the emperor of direct personal rule. As a step in this direction, 
Mutsu Hito transferred his capital from Kiot6 to Yedo, the 
former seat of the shoguns' government, and marked the event 
by renaming the city Tokyo, or Eastern Capital. In 1869 the 
emperor paid a visit to his old capital, and there took as his 
imperial consort a princess of the house of Ichijo. In the same 
year Mutsu Hito bound himself by oath to institute certain 
reforms, the first of which was the establishment of a deliberative 
assembly. In this onward movement he was supported by the 
majority of the daimios, who in a supreme moment of patriotism 
surrendered their estates and privileges to their sovereign. This 
was the death-knell of the feudalism which had existed for so 
many centuries in Japan, and gave Mutsu Hito the free hand 
which he desired. A centralized bureaucracy took the place of 
the old system, and the nation moved rapidly along the road of 
progress. Everything European was eagerly adopted, even 
down to frock-coats and patent-leather boots for the officials. 
Torture was abolished (1873), and a judicial code, adapted from 
the Code Napol6on, was authorized. The first railway — that 
from Yokohama to Tokyo — was opened in 1872; the European 
calendar was adopted, and English was introduced into the 
curriculum of the common schools. In all these reforms Mutsu 
Hito took a leading part. But it was not to be expected that 
such sweeping changes could be effected without opposition, 
and thrice during the period between 1876 and 1884 the emperor 
had to face serious rebellious movements in the provinces. 
These he succeeded in suppressing; and even amid these pre- 
occupations he managed to inflict a check on his huge neighbour, 
the empire of China. As the government of this state declared 
that it was incapable of punishing certain Formosan pirates for 
outrages committed on Japanese ships (1874), Mutsu Hito 
landed a force on the island, and, having inflicted chastisement 
on the bandits, remained in possession of certain districts until 
the compensation demanded from Peking was paid. The un- 
paralleled advances which had been made by the government 
were now held by the emperor and his advisers to justify a 
demand for the revision of the foreign treaties, and negotiations 
were opened with this object. They failed, however, and the 
consequent disappointment gave rise to a strong reaction against 
everything foreign throughout the country. Foreigners were 
assaulted on the roads, and even the Russian cesarevich, after- 
wards the tsar Nicholas II., was attacked by would-be assassins 
in the streets of Tokyo. A renewed attempt to revise the 
treaties in 1894 was more successful, and in that year Great 
Britain led the way by concluding a revised treaty with Japan. 
Other nations followed, and by 1901 all those obnoxious clauses 
suggestive of political inferiority had finally disappeared from the 
treaties. In the same year (1894) war broke out with China, and 
Mutsu Hito, in common with his subjects, showed the greatest 
zeal for the campaign. He reviewed the troops as they left 
the shores of Japan for Korea and Manchuria, and personally 
distributed rewards to those who had won distinction. In 
the war with Russia, 1904-5, the same was the case, and it was 
to the virtues of their emperor that his generals loyally ascribed 



the Japanese victories. In his wise patriotism, as in all matters, 
Mutsu Hito always placed himself in the van of his countrymen. 
He led them out of the trammels of feudalism ; by his progressive 
rule he lived to see his country advanced to the first rank of 
nations; and he was the first Oriental sovereign to form an 
offensive and defensive alliance with a first-rate European 
power. In 1869 Mutsu Hito married Princess Ham, daughter 
of Ichijo Tadaka, a noble of the first rank. He has one son 
and several daughters, his heir-apparent being Yoshi Hito, who 
was born on the 31st of August 1879, and married in 1900 
Princess Sada, daughter of Prince Kuj6, by whom he had three 
sons before 1909. Mutsu Hito adopted the epithet of Meiji, or 
" Enlightened Peace," as the nengo or title of his reign. Thus 
the year 1001, according to the Japanese calendar, was the 
34th year of Meiji. 

MUTTRA, or Mathura, a city and district of British India 
in the Agra division of the United Provinces. The city is on the 
right bank of the Jumna, 30 m. above Agra; it is an important 
railway junction. Pop. (1901), 60,042. It is an ancient town, 
mentioned by Fa Hien as a centre of Buddhism about a.d. 400; 
his successor Hsiian Tsang, about 650, states that it then con- 
tained twenty Buddhist monasteries and five Brahmanical 
temples. Muttra has suffered more from Mahommedan plunder 
than most towns of northern India. It was sacked by Mah- 
mud of Ghazni in 1 01 7-18; about 1500 Sultan Sikandar Lodi 
utterly destroyed all the Hindu shrines, temples and images; 
and in 1636 Shah Jahan appointed a governor expressly to 
" stamp out idolatry." In 1669-70 Aurangzeb visited the city 
and continued the work of destruction. Muttra was again 
captured and plundered by Ahmad Shah with 25,000 Afghan 
cavalry in 1756. The town still forms a great centre of Hindu 
devotion, and large numbers of pilgrims flock annually to the 
festivals. The special cult of Krishna with which the neighbour- 
hood is associated seems to be of comparatively late date. 
Much of the prosperity of the town is due to the residence of a 
great family of seths or native bankers, who were conspicuously 
loyal during the Mutiny. Temples and bathing-stairs line the 
river bank. The majority are modern, but the mosque of 
Aurangzeb, on a lofty site, dates from 1669. Most of the public 
buildings are of white stone, handsomely carved. There are 
an American mission, a Roman Catholic church, a museum of 
antiquities, and a cantonment for a .British cavalry regiment. 
Cotton, paper and pilgrims' charms are the chief articles of 
manufacture. 

The District op Muttra has an area of 1445 sq. m. It consists 
of an irregular strip of territory lying on both sides of the 
Jumna. The general level is only broken at the south-western 
angle by low ranges of limestone hills. The eastern half con- 
sists for the most part of a rich upland plain, abundantly irrigated 
by wells, rivers and canals, while the western portion, though 
rich in mythological association and antiquarian remains, is 
comparatively unfavoured by nature. For eight months of the 
year the Jumna shrinks to the dimensions of a mere rivulet, 
meandering through a waste of sand. During the rains, how- 
ever, it swells to a mighty stream, a mile or more in breadth. 
Formerly nearly the whole of Muttra consisted of pasture and 
woodland, but the roads constructed as relief works in 1837-1838 
have thrown open many large tracts of country, and the task 
of reclamation has since proceeded rapidly. The population 
in 1901 was 763,099, showing an increase of 7 % in the 
decade. The principal crops are millets, pulse, cotton, wheat, 
barley and sugar cane. The famine of 1878 was severely felt. 
The eastern half of the district is watered by the Agra canal, 
which is navigable, and the western half by branches of the 
Ganges canal. A branch of the Rajputana railway, from 
Achnera to Hathras, crosses the district; the chord line of the 
East India, from Agra to Delhi, traverses it from north to south ; 
and a new line, connecting with the Great Indian Peninsula, 
was opened in 1905. 

The central portion of Muttra district forms one of the most 
sacred spots in Hindu mythology. A circuit of 84 kos around 
Gokul and Brindaban bears the name of the Braj-Mandal, and 



102 



MUTULE— MUZAFFARNAGAR 



carries with it many associations of earliest Aryan times. 
Here Krishna and his brother Balarama fed their cattle upon the 
plain; and numerous relics of antiquity in the towns of Muttra, 
Gobardhan, Gokul, Mahaban and Brindaban still attest the 
sanctity with which this holy tract was invested. During the 
Buddhist period Muttra became a centre of the new faith. 
After the invasion of Mahmud of Ghazni the city fell into 
insignificance till the reign of Akbar; and thenceforward its 
history merges in that of the Jats of Bharatpur, until it again 
acquired separate individuality under Suraj Mai in the middle 
of the 1 8th century. The Bharatpur chiefs took an active part 
in the disturbances consequent on the declining power of the 
Mogul emperors, sometimes on the imperial side, and at others 
with the Mahrattas. The whole of Muttra passed under British 
rule in 1804. 
See F. S. Growse, Mathura (Allahabad, 1883). 

MUTULE (Lat. mutulus, a stay or bracket), in architecture 
the rectangular block under the soffit of the cornice of the Greek 
Doric temple, which is studded with guttae. It is supposed to 
represent the piece of timber through which the wooden pegs 
were driven in order to hold the rafter in position, and it follows 
the rake of the roof. In the Roman Doric order the mutule 
was horizontal, with sometimes a crowning fillet, so that it 
virtually fulfilled the purpose of the modillion in the Corinthian 
cornice. 

MUZAFFAR-ED-DlN, shah of Persia (1853-1907), the second 
son of Shah Nasr-ed-DIn, was born on the 25th of March 1853. 
He was in due course declared wit ahd, or heir-apparent, and 
invested with the governorship of Azerbaijan, but on the 
assassination of his father in 1896 it was feared that his elder 
brother, Zill-es-Sultan, the governor of Isfahan, might prove 
a dangerous rival, especially when it was remembered that 
Muzaffar-ed-Din had been recalled to Teheran by his father upon 
his failure to suppress a Kurd rising in his province. The 
British and Russian governments, in order to avoid wide- 
spread disturbances, agreed however to give him their support. 
All opposition was thus obviated, and Muzaffar-ed-Din was 
duly enthroned on the 8th of June 1896, the Russian general 
Kosakowsky, commander of the Persian Cossacks, presiding over 
the ceremony with drawn sword. On this occasion the new 
shah announced the suppression of all purchase of civil and 
military posts, and then proceeded to remit in perpetuity all 
taxes on bread and meat, thus lightening the taxation on food, 
which had caused the only disturbances in the last reign. But 
whatever hopes may have been aroused by this auspicious 
beginning of the reign were soon dashed owing to the extrava- 
gance and profligacy of the court, which kept the treasury in 
a chronic state of depletion. Towards the end of 1896 the 
Amin-es-Sultan, who had heen grand vizier during the last 
years of Nasr-ed-Dln's reign, was disgraced, and Muzaffar-ed- 
Din announced his intention of heing in future his own grand 
vizier. The Amin-ad-Dowla, a less masterful servant, took 
office with the lower title of prime minister. During his short 
administration an elaborate scheme of reforms was drawn up 
on paper, and remained on paper. The treasury continued 
empty, and in the spring of 1898 Amin-es-Sultan was recalled 
with the special object of filling it. The delay of the British 
government in sanctioning a loan in London gave Russia her 
opportunity. A Russian loan was followed by the establishment 
of a Russian bank at Teheran, and the vast expansion of 
Russian influence generally. At the beginning of 1900 a 
fresh gold loan was negotiated with Russia, and a few 
months later Muzaffar-ed-Din started on a tour in Europe 
by way of St Petersburg, where he was received with great 
state. He subsequently went to Paris to visit the Exhibition 
of 1900, and while there an attempt on his life was made 
by a madman named Francois Salson. In spite of this 
experience the shah so enjoyed his European tour that he 
determined to repeat it as soon as possible. By the end of 
1901 his treasury was again empty; but a fresh Russian loan 
replenished it and in 1902 he again came to Europe, paying 
on this occasion a state visit to England. On his way back 



he stopped at St Petersburg, and at a banquet given in his 
honour by the tsar toasts were exchanged of unmistakable 
significance. None the less, during his visit to King Edward VII. 
the shah had been profuse in his expressions of friendship for 
Great Britain, and in the spring of 1903 a special mission was 
sent to Teheran to invest him with the Order of the Garter. 

The shah's misguided policy had created widespread dis- 
affection in the country, and the brunt of popular disfavour 
fell on the ataheg (the title by which the Amin-es-Sultan was 
now known), who was once more disgraced in September 1903. 
The war with Japan now relaxed the Russian pressure on 
Teheran, and at the same time dried up the source of supplies; 
and the clergy, giving voice to the general misery and discontent, 
grew more and more outspoken in their denunciations of the 
shah's misrule. Nevertheless Muzaffar-ed-Din defied public 
opinion by making another journey to Europe in 1905; hut, 
though received with the customary distinction at St Petersburg, 
he failed to obtain further supplies. In the summer of 1006 
popular discontent culminated in extraordinary demonstrations 
at Teheran, which practically amounted to a general strike. 
The shah was forced to yield, and proclaimed a liberal con- 
stitution, the first parliament being opened by him on the 12th 
of October 1906. Muzaffar-ed-Din died on the 8th of January 
1907, heing succeeded by his son Mahommed Ali Mirza. 

MUZAFFARGARH, a town and district of British India, 
in the Multan division of the Punjab. The town is near the 
right bank of the river Chenab, and has a railway station. 
Pop. (1901), 4018. Its fort and a mosque were built by Nawab 
Muzaffar Khan in 1794-1796. 

The District of Muzaffargarh occupies the lower end of 
the Sind-Sagar Doab. Area, 3635 sq. m. In the northern 
half of the district is the wild thai or central desert, an arid 
elevated tract with a width of 40 m. in the extreme north, 
which gradually contracts until it disappears about 10 m. 
south of Muzaffargarh town. Although apparently a table-land, 
it is really composed of separate sandhills, with intermediate 
valleys lying at a lower level than that of the Indus, and at 
times flooded. The towns stand on high sites or are protected 
by embankments; but the villages scattered over the lowlands 
are exposed to annual inundations, during which the people 
abandon their grass-built huts, and take refuge on wooden 
platforms attached to each house. Throughout the cold weather 
large herds of camels, belonging chiefly to the Povindah 
merchants of Afghanistan, graze upon the sandy waste. 

The district possesses hardly any distinct annals of its own, 
having always formed part of Multan (q.v.). The population 
in 1901 was 405,656, showing an increase of 6-4% in the decade, 
due to the extension of irrigation. The principal crops are 
wheat, pulse, rice and indigo. The most important domestic 
animal is the camel. The district is crossed by the North- 
western railway, and the boundary rivers are navigable, besides 
furnishing numerous irrigation channels, originally constructed 
under native rule. * 

MUZAFFARNAGAR, a town and district of British India, 
in the Meerut division of the United Provinces. The town is 
790 ft. above the sea, and has a station on the North-Western 
railway. Pop. (1901), 23,444. It is an important trading centre 
and has a manufacture of blankets. It was founded about 1633 
by the son of Muzaffar Khan, Khan-i-Jahan, one of the famous 
Sayid family who rose to power under the emperor Shah Jahan. 

The District of Muzaffarnagar has an area of 1666 sq. m. 
It lies near the northern extremity of the Doah or great alluvial 
plain between the Ganges and the Jumna, and shares to a large 
extent in the general monotony of that level region. A great 
portion is sandy and unfertile; but under irrigation the soil is 
rapidly improving, and in many places the villagers have 
succeeded in introducing a high state of cultivation. Before 
the opening of the canals Muzaffarnagar was liable to famines 
caused by drought; but the danger from this has been mini- 
mized by the spread of irrigation. It is traversed by four main 
canals, the Ganges, Anupshahr, Deoband and Eastern Jumna. 
Its trade is confined to the raw materials it produces. The 



MUZAFFARPUR— MYCENAE

climate of the district is comparatively cool, owing to the 
proximity of the hills; and the average annual rainfall is 55 in. 
The population in 1901 was* 877,188, showing an increase of 
13-5 % in the decade, which was a period of unexampled 
prosperity. The principal crops are wheat, pulse, cotton and 
sugar-cane. The district is crossed by the North-Western 
railway from Delhi to Saharanpur. 

Hindu tradition represents Muzaffarnagar as having formed a 
portion of the Pandava kingdom of the Mahdbharata; authentic 
history, however, dates from the time of the Moslem conquests 
in the 13th century, from which time it remained a dependency 
of the various Mahommedan dynasties which ruled at Delhi 
until the practical downfall of the Mogul Empire in the middle 
of the 18th century. In 1788 the district fell into the hands 
of the Mahrattas. After the fall of Aligarh, the whole Doab 
as far north as the Siwalik hills passed into the hands of the 
British without a blow, and Muzaffarnagar became part of 
Saharanpur. It was created a separate jurisdiction in 1824. 
During the Mutiny there was some disorder, chiefly occasioned 
by official weakness, but no severe fighting. 

See Muzaffarnagar District Gazetteer (Allahabad, 1903). 

MUZAFFARPUR, a town and district of British India, in the 
Patna division of Bengal. The town is on the right bank of 
the Little Gandak river, and has a railway station. Pop. (1901), 
45,617. The town is well laid out, and is an important centre 
of trade, being on the direct route from Patna to Nepal. It is 
the headquarters of the Behar Light Horse volunteer corps and 
has a college established in 1899. 

The District of Muzaffarpur has an area of 3035 sq. m. It 
was formed in January 1875 out of the great district of Tirhoot, 
which up to that time was the largest and most populous district 
of Lower Bengal. The district is an alluvial plain between the 
Ganges and the Great Gandak, the Baghmat and Little Gandak 
being the principal rivers within it. South of the Little Gandak 
the land is somewhat elevated, with depressions containing 
lakes toward the south-east. North of the Baghmat the land 
is lower and marshy, but is traversed by elevated dry ridges. 
The tract between the two rivers is lowest of all and liable to 
floods. * Pop. (1901), 2,754,790, showing an increase of 1*5 % 
in the decade. Average density, 914 per sq. m., being exceeded 
in all India only by the neighbouring district of Saran. Indigo 
(superseded to some extent, owing to the fall in price, by sugar) 
and opium are largely grown. Rice is the chief grain crop, 
and cloth, carpets and pottery are manufactured. The district 
is traversed in several directions by the Tirhoot system of the 
Bengal and North-Western railway. It suffered from drought 
in 1873-1874, and again in 1897-1898.

MUZIANO, GIROLAMO (1528-1592), Italian painter, was 
born at Acquafredda, near Brescia, in £528. Under Romanino, 
an imitator of Titian, he studied his art, designing and colouring 
according to the principles of the Venetian school. But it was 
not until he had left his native place, still in early youth, and 
had repaired to Rome about 1550, that he came into notice. 
There his pictures soon gained for him the surname of // Giovane 
de J paesi (the young man of the landscapes); chestnut-trees 
are predominant in these works. He next tried the more 
elevated style of historical painting. He imitated Michelangelo 
in giving great prominence to the anatomy of his figures, and 
became fond of painting persons emaciated by abstinence or 
even disease. His great picture of the " Resurrection of 
Lazarus " at once established his fame. Michelangelo praised 
it, and pronounced its author one of the first artists of that age. 
It was placed in the church of Santa Maria Maggiore, but was 
afterwards transferred to the Quirinal Palace. Muziano, with 
dogged perseverance (at one time he shaved his head, so as not 
to be tempted to go out of doors), continued to proceed in the 
path on which he had entered. He grew excellent in depicting 
foreign and military costumes, and in introducing landscapes 
into his historical pieces after the manner of Titian. Mosaic 
working also occupied his attention while he was employed as 



superintendent at the Vatican; and it became under his hands 
a perfect imitation of painting. His ability and industry soon 
gained for him a handsome fortune. Part of this he expended 
in assisting to found the Academy of St Luke in Rome. He 
died in 1592, and was buried in the church of Santa Maria 
Maggiore. 

Many of Muziano's works are in the churches and palaces of 
Rome; he also worked in Orvieto and Loreto. In Santa Maria 
degli Angeli, Rome, is one of his chief works, " St Jerome preaching 
to Monks in the Desert " ; his " Circumcision " is in the church of the 
Gesu, his " Ascension " in the Araceli, and his " St Francis receiv- 
ing the Stigmata " in the church of the Conception. A picture by 
him, representing Christ washing the feet of His disciples, is in the 
cathedral of Reims. 

MUZZIOLI, GIOVANNI (1854-1894), Italian painter, was 
born in Modena, whither his family had removed from Castel- 
vetro, on the 10th of February 1854. From the time that he 
began to attend the local academy at the age of thirteen he was 
recognized as a prodigy, and four years later, by the unanimous 
vote of the judges, he gained the Poletti scholarship entitling 
him to four years' residence in Rome and Florence. After his 
return to Modena, Muzzioli visited the Paris Exhibition, and 
there came under the influence of Sir L. Alma Tadema. His 
first important picture was " In the Temple of Bacchus " (18S1); 
and his masterpiece, " The Funeral of Britannicus," was one of 
the chief successes of the Bologna Exhibition of 1888. From 
1878 to his death (August 5, 1894) Muzzioli lived in Florence, 
where he painted the altar-piece for the church of Castelvetro.

1898). 

MWERU, a large lake of Eastern Central Africa, traversed 
by the Luapula or upper Congo. It lies 3000 ft. above the sea; 
measures about 76 m. in length by some 25 in breadth, and is 
roughly rectangular, the axis running from S.S.W. to N.N.E. 
It is cut a little south of its centre by 9 S. and through its 
N.E. corner passes 29 E. At the south end a shallow bay 
extends to 9 31' S. East of this, and some miles further north, 
the Luapula enters from a Vast marsh inundated at high water; 
it leaves the lake at the north-west corner, making a sharp bend 
to the west before assuming a northerly direction. Besides 
the Luapula, the principal influent is the Kalungwizi, from the 
east. Near the south end of the lake lies the island of Kilwa, 
about 8 m. in length, rising into plateaus 600 ft. above the 
lake. Here the air is cool and balmy, the soil dry, with short 
turf and clumps of shady trees, affording every requirement for 
a sanatorium. Mweru was reached by David Livingstone in 
1867, but its western shore was first explored in 1890 by Sir 
Alfred Sharpe, who two years later effected its circumnavigation. 
The eastern shores from the Luapula entrance to its exit, 
together with Kilwa Island, belong to British Central Africa; 
the western to the Belgian Congo. 

MYAUNGMYA, a district in the Irrawaddy division of lower 
Burma, formed in 1803 out of a portion of Bassein district, and 
reconstituted in 1903. It has an area of 2663 sq. m., and a 
population (1901) of 278,119, showing an increase of 49% in 
the decade and a density of 104 inhabitants to the square mile. 
Among the population were about 12,800 Christians, mostly 
Karens. The district is a deltaic tract, bordering south on the 
sea and traversed by many tidal creeks. Rice cultivation and 
fishing occupy practically all the inhabitants of the district. 
The town of Myaungmya had 47 11 inhabitants in 1901. 

MYCENAE, one of the most ancient cities of Greece, was 
situated on a hill above the northern extremity of the fertile 
Argive plain — MVXV "Apyeos hnrofi&roio. Its situation is ex- 
ceedingly strong, and it commands all the roads leading from 
Corinth and Achaea into the Argive plain. The walls of Mycenae 
are the greatest monument that remains of the Heroic age 
in Greece; part of them is similar in style and doubtless con- 
temporary in date with the walls of the neighboufing town 
Tiryns. There can therefore be little doubt that the two 
towns were the strongholds of a single race, Tiryns commanding 
the sea-coast and Mycenae the inner country. Legend tells 
of the rivalry between the dynasties of the Pelopidae at Mycenae 



104 



MYCENAE 



and of the Proetidae at Argos. In early historic times Argos 
had obtained the predominance. The Mycenaeans, who had 
temporarily regained their independence with the help of 
Sparta, fought on the Greek side at Plataea in 479 B.C. The 
long warfare between tbe two cities lasted till 468 B.C., when 
Mycenae was dismantled and its inhabitants dispersed. The 
city never revived; Strabo asserts that no trace of it remained 
in his time, but Pausanias describes the ruins. For the character 
of Mycenaean art and of the antiquities found at Mycenae 
see Aegean Civilization. 

The extant remains of the town of Mycenae are spread over 
the hill between the village of Charvati and the Acropolis. 
They consist of some traces of town walls and of houses, and 
of an early bridge over the stream to the east, on the road 
leading to the Heraeum. The walls of the Acropolis are in 



of thin slabs of stone set up on end, with others laid across the 
top of them; at the part of this enclosure nearest to the Lion 
Gate is an entrance. Some have supposed the circle of slabs 
to be the retaining wall of a tumulus; but its structure is not 
solid enough for such a purpose, and it can hardly be anything 
but a sacred enclosure. It was within this circle that Dr H. 
Schliemann found the five graves that contained a marvellous 
wealth of gold ornaments and other objects; a sixth was sub- 
sequently found. Above one of the graves was a small circular 
altar, and there were also several sculptured slabs set up above 
them. The graves themselves were mere shafts sunk in the 
rock. Dr Schliemann identified them with the graves of 
Agamemnon, Cassandra, and their companions, which were 
shown to Pausanias within the walls; and there can be little 
doubt that they are the graves that gave rise to the tradition,

the shape of an irregular triangle, and occupy a position of 
■great natural strength between two valleys. They are preserved 
to a considerable height on all sides, except where the ravine 
is precipitous and they have been carried away by a landslip; 
they are for the most part built of irregular blocks of great 
size in the so-called " Cyclopian " style; but certain portions, 
notably that near the chief gate, are built in almost regular 
courses of squared stones; there are also some later repairs in 
polygonal masonry. The main entrance is called tbe Lion Gate, 
from the famous triangular relief which fills the space above 
its massive lintel. This represents two lions confronted, resting 
their front legs on a low altar-like structure on which is a 
pillar which stands between them. The device is a translation 
into stone of a type not uncommon in gem-cutter's and 
goldsmith's work of the " Mycenaean " age. The gate is 
approached by a road commanded on one side by the city wall, 
■ on the other by a projecting tower. There is also a postern 
gate on the north side of the wall, and at its eastern extremity 
are two apertures in the thickness of the wall. One of these 
leads out on to the rocks above the southern ravine, the other 
leads to a long staircase, completely concealed in the wall and 
the rocks, leading down to a subterranean well or spring. Just 
within the Lion Gate is a projection of the wall surrounding a 
curious circular enclosure, consisting of two concentric circles 



though the historical identity of the persons actually buried in 
them is a more difficult question. Outside the circle, especially 
to the south of it, numerous remains of houses of the Mycenaean 
age have been found, and others, terraced up at various levels, 
occupy almost the whole of the Acropolis. On the summit, 
approached by a well-preserved flight of steps, are the remains 
of a palace of the Mycenaean age, similar to that found at 
Tiryns, though not so complicated or extensive. Above them 
are the foundations of a Doric temple, probably dating from the 
last days of Mycenaean independence in the 5th century. 

Numerous graves have been found in the slopes of the hills 
adjoining the town of Mycenae. Most of these consist merely of 
a chamber, usually square, excavated in the rock, and approached 
by a " dromos " or horizontal approach in the side of a hill. 
They are sometimes provided with doorways faced with stucco, 
and these have painted ornamentation. Many of these tombs 
have been opened, and their contents are in the Athens museum. 
Another and much more conspicuous kind of tomb is that 
known as the beehive tomb. There are eight of them at Mycenae 
itself, and others in the neighbourhood. Some of them were 
visible in the time of Pausanias, who calls them the places 
where Atreus and his sons kept their treasures. There can, 
however, be no doubt that they were the tombs of princely 
families. The largest and best preserved of them, now 



MYCETOZOA 



105 



commonly called the Treasury of Atreus, is just outside the Lion 
Gate. It consists of a circular domed chamber, nearly 50 ft, 
in diameter and in height; a smaller square chamber opens out 
of it. It is approached by a horizontal avenue 20 ft. wide and 
115 ft. long, with side walls of squared stone sloping up to a 
height of 45 ft. The doorway was flanked with columns of 
alabaster, with rich spiral ornament, now in the British Museum; 
and the rest of the facade was very richly decorated, as may 
he seen from Chipiez's fine restoration. The inside of the 
vault was ornamented with attached bronze ornaments, but 
not, as is sometimes stated, entirely lined with bronze. It is 
generally supposed that these tombs, as well as those excavated 
in the rock, belong to a later date than the shaft-tombs on the 
Acropolis.

MYCETOZOA (Myxomycetes, Schleimpilze), in zoology, a 
group of organisms reproducing themselves by spores. These 
are produced in or on sporangia which are formed in the air 
and the spores are distributed by the currents of air. They 
thus differ from other spore-bearing members of the animal 
kingdom (which produce their spores while immersed in water 
or, in the case of parasites, within the fluids of their hosts), 
and resemble the Fungi and many of the lower green plants. 
In relation with this condition of their fructification the structures 
formed at the spore-bearing stage to contain or support the 
spores present a remarkable resemblance to the sporangia of 
certain groups of Fungi, from which, however, the Mycetozoa 
are essentially different. 

Although the sporangial and some other phases have long been 
known, and Fries had enumerated 192 species in 1829, the 
main features of their life-history were first worked out in 1859- 
1860 by de Bary (1 and 2). He showed that in the Mycetozoa 
the spore hatches out as a mass of naked protoplasm which 
almost immediately assumes a free-swimming flagellate form 
(zoospore), that after multiplying by division this passes into an 
amoeboid phase, and that from such amoebae the plasmodia 
arise, though the mode of their origin was not ascertained by him. 

The Plasmodium of the Mycetozoa is a mass of simple proto- 
plasm, without a differentiated envelope and endowed with 
the power of active locomotion. It penetrates the interstices 
of decaying vegetable matter, or, in the case of the species 
Badhamia utricularis, spreads as a film on the surface of living 
fungi; it may grow almost indefinitely in size, attaining under 
favourable conditions several feet in extent. It constitutes 
the dominant phase of the life-history. From the Plasmodium 
the sporangia take their origin. It was Cienkowski who (in 
1863) contributed the important fact that the plasmodia arise 
by the fusion with one another of numbers of individuals in 
the amoeboid phase — a mode of origin which is now generally 
recognized as an essential feature in the conception of a 
Plasmodium, whether as occurring among the Mycetozoa or 
in other groups (7). De Bary clearly expressed the view that 
the life-history of the Mycetozoa shows them to belong not 
to the vegetable but to the animal kingdom. 

The individual sporangia of the Mycetozoa are, for the most 
part, minute structures, rarely attaining the size of a mustard- 
seed, though, in the composite form of aethalia, they may 
form cake-like masses an inch or more across (fig. 21). They are 
found, stalked or sessile, in small clusters or distributed by the 
thousand over a wide area many feet in diameter, on the bark 
of decaying trees, on dead leaves or sticks, in woods and shrub- 
beries, among the stems of plants on wet moors, and, generally, 
at the surface in localities where there is a substratum of decaying 
vegetable matter sufficiently moist to allow the Plasmodium 
to live. Tan-heaps have long been known as a favourite habitat 
of Fuligo septica, the plasmodia of which, emerging in bright 
yellow masses at the surface prior to the sporangial (in this 
case aethalial) phase, are known as " flowers of tan." The 



film-like, expanded condition of the Plasmodium, varying in 
colour in different species and traversed by a network of vein- 
like channels (fig. 5), has long been known. The plasmodial 
stage was at one time regarded as representing a distinct group 
of fungi, to which the generic name Mesenterica was applied. 
The species of Mycetozoa are widely distributed over the world in 
temperate and tropical latitudes where there is sufficient 
moisture for them to grow, and they must be regarded as not 
inconsiderable agents in the disintegrating processes of nature, 
by which complex organic substances are decomposed into 
simpler and more stable chemical groups. 

Classification, — The Mycetozoa, as here understood, fall into 
three main divisions. The Endosporeae, in which the spores are 
contained within sporangia, form together with the Exosporeae, 
which bear their spores on the surface of sporophores, a natural 
group characterized by forming true plasmodia. They con- 
stitute the Euplasmodida. Standing apart from them is the 
small group of the mould-like Sorophora, in which the amoeboid 
individuals only come together immediately prior to spore- 
formation and do not completely fuse with one another. 

A number of other organisms living on vegetable and animal 
bodies, alive or dead, and leading an entirely aquatic life, are 
included by Zopf (31) under the Mycetozoa, as the " Monadina," 
in distinction from the " Eumycetozoa," consisting of the three 
groups above mentioned. The alliance of some of these (e.g. 
Protomonas) with the Mycetozoa is probable, and was accepted 
by de Bary, but the relations of other Monadina are obscure, 
and appear to be at least as close with the Heliozoa (with which 
many have in fact been^classed). The limits here adopted, 
following de Bary, include a group of organisms which, as 
shown by their life-history, belong to the animal stock, and yet 
alone among animals 1 they have acquired the habit, widely 
found in the vegetable kingdom, of developing and distributing 
their spores in air.

We may begin our survey of the life-history at the point where 
the spores, borne on currents of air, have settled among wet decaying 
vegetable matter. Shrunken when dry, they rapidly absorb water 

and resume the spherical

shape which is found in 
nearly all species. Each 
is surrounded by a spore 
wall, sheltered by which 
the protoplasm, though 
losing moisture by drying, 
may remain alive for as 
many as four years. In 
several cases it has been 
found to give the chemical 
reaction of cellulose. It 
is smooth or variously 
sculptured according to 
the species. Within the 
protoplasm may be seen 
the nucleus, and one or 
more contractile vacuoles 
make their appearance.

swims away with a characteristic dancing motion. The proto- 
plasm is granular within but hyaline externally (fig. I, d). The 
nucleus, lying at the end of the body where it tapers into the 
flagellum, is limited by a definite wall and contains a nuclear 

network and a nucleolus. It often 
presents the appearance of being 
drawn out into a point towards the 
flagellum, and a bell-like structure 
[first described by Plenge {27)], 
staining more darkly than the rest 
of the protoplasm, extends from the 
base of the flagellum and invests 
the nucleus (fig. 2, a and c). The 
other end of the zoospore may be 
evenly rounded (fig. 1, d) or it may 
be produced into short pseudo- 
podia (fig. 1 , e). By means of these 
the zoospore captures bacteria 
which are drawn into the body and

Reticularia Lycoperdon (X That the zoospores of many

bacteria has been shown by A. 
Lister (18). New light has recently been thrown on the matter 
by Pinoy (26), who has worked chiefly with Sorophora, in which, 
as shown below, the active phase of the life-history is passed

mainly in the state ef isolated amoebae. Pinoy finds that the 
amoebae of this group live on particular species of bacteria, and that 
the presence of the latter is a necessary condition for the develop- 
ment of the Sorophora, and even (as has been recognized by other 
workers) for the hatching of their spores. Pinoy's results indicate, 
though not so conclusively, that bacteria are likewise the essential 
food of the Euplasmodida in the early phases of their life-history. 
The zoospores do, however, ingest other solid bodies, e.g. carmine 
granules (Saville Kent, 15). 

The zoospores multiply by binary fission, the flagellum being 
withdrawn and the nucleus undergoing mitotic division, with the 
formation of a well-marked achromatic spindle (fig. 3). 

It is probable that fission occurs more than once in the zoospore 
stage; but there is not satisfactory evidence to show how often 
it may be repeated. 2 

At this, as at other phases of the life-history, a resting stage 
may be assumed as the result of drying, but also from other and 
unknown causes. The flagel- 
lum is withdrawn and the 
protoplasm, becoming spheri- 
cal, secretes a cyst wall. The 
organism thus passes into the 
condition of a microcyst, from 
which when dry it may be 
awakened to renewed activity 
by wetting. 

At the end of the zoospore 
stage the organism finally 
withdraws its flagellum and 
assumes the amoeboid shape. 
It is now known as an amoe- 
bula. The amoebulae become 
endowed, as was first recog- 
nized by Cienkowski, with 
mutuaL attraction, and on After A. Lister, 
meeting fuse with one another. _ . , , . _ , ,

modium. The fusion between 

the protoplasmic bodies of the amoebulae which unite to form it is 
complete. Their nuclei may be traced for some time in the young 
Plasmodium and no fusion between them has been observed at this 
stage (20). As the Plasmodium increases in size by the addition of 
amoebulae the task of following the fate of the individual nuclei by 
direct observation becomes impossible. 

The appearance of an active Plasmodium of Badkamia uiricularis, 
which, as we have seen, lives and feeds on certain fungi, is shown in 
fig. 5 # - It consists of a film of protoplasm, of a bright yellow colour, 
varying in size up to a foot or more in diameter. It is traversed 
by a network of branching and anastomosing channels, which divide 
up and are gradually lost as they approach the margin where the 
protoplasm forms a uniform and lobate border. Elsewhere the

main trunks of the network may lie free with little or no connecting 
film between them and their neighbours. The Plasmodia of other 
species, which live in the interstices of decaying vegetable matter, 
are less easily observed, but on emerging on the surface prior to 

2 Pinoy states (26) that the spores of Spumaria alba, cultivated 
with bacteria on solid media, hatch out into amoebae, which under 
these conditions do not assume the flagellate stage. The amoeba 
from a spore was observed to give rise by three successive divisions 
to eight amoebulae.

spore formation they present an essentially similar appearance. 
There is, however, great variety in the degree of concentration or 
expansion presented by Plasmodia, in relation with food supply, 
moisture and other circumstances. The plasmodia move slowly 
about over or in the substratum, concentrating in regions where food 
supply is ahundant, and leaving those where it is exhausted. 

On examining under the microscope a film which has spread oyer 
a cover-slip, the channels are seen to be streams of rapidly moving 
granular protoplasm. This movement is rhythmic in character, 
being directed alternately towards the margin of an advancing 
region of the Plasmodium, and away from it. As a channel is 
watched the stream of granules is seen to becomeslower, and after 
a momentary pause to begin in the opposite direction. In an active 
Plasmodium the duration of the flow in either direction varies from 
a minute and a half to two minutes, though it is always longer when, 
in the direction of the general advance over the substratum. When 
the flow of^ the protoplasm is in this latter direction the border be- 
comes turgid, and lobes of hyaline protoplasm are seen (under a high 
magnification) to start forward, and soon to become filled with granu- 
lar contents. t When the flow is reversed, the margin becomes thin 
from the drainage away of its contents. A delicate hyaline layer 
invests the plasm odium, and is apparently less fluid than the material 
flowing in the channels. The phenomena of the rhythmic movement 
of the protoplasm are not inconsistent with the vievr that they result 
from alternating contraction and relaxation of the outer layer in 
different regions of the Plasmodium, but any dogmatic statement as 
to their causation appears at present inadvisable.

Minute contractile vacuoles may be seen in great numbers in the 
thin parts of the Plasmodium between the channels. In stained 
preparations nuclei, varying (in Badhamia utricularis) from 2-5 to 
5 micrornillimeters in diameter, are found abundantly in the granular 
protoplasm (fig. 6, b). They contain a nuclear reticulum and one 
or more well-marked nucleoli. In any stained plasmodium some 
nuclei may be found, as shown in the figure &, which appear to be 
in some stage of simple (amitotic) division, and this is, presumably, 
the chief mode in which the number of the nuclei keeps pace with 
the rapidly growing plasmodium. There is, however, another mode 
of nuclear division in the plasmodium which has hitherto been 
observed in one recorded instance (19, p. 5^1), the mitotic (fig. 6, c-/), 
and this appears to befall all the nuclei of a plasmodium simul- 
taneously. What the relation of these two modes of nuclear division 
may be to the life-history is obscure. 

That the amitotic is the usual mode of nuclear division is indicated 
by the very frequent occurrence of these apparently dividing nuclei 
and also by the following experiment. A Plasmodium of Badhamia 
utricularis spreading over pieces of the fungus Auricularia' was 
observed to increase in size about fourfold in fourteen hours, and 
during this time a small sample was removed and stained every 
quarter of an hour. The later stainings showed no diminution in 
the number of nuclei in proportion to the protoplasm, and yet none 
of the sample showed any sign of mitotic division (20, p. 9). It 
would appear therefore that the mode of increase of the nuclei during 
this penod was amitotic. 




Prowazek (28) has recently referred to nuclear stages, similar to 
those here regarded as of amitotic division, but has interpreted 
them as nuclear fusions. He does not, however, discuss the mode 
of multiplication of nuclei in the plasmodium. 

In the group of the Calcareae, granules of carbonate of lime are 
abundant in the plasmodia, and in all Mycetozoa other granules of 
undetermined nature are present. The colour of plasmodia varies 
in different species, andmay be yellow, white, pink, purple or green. 
The colouring matter is in the form of minute drops, and in the 
Calcareae these invest the lime granules. 

Nutrition. — The plasmodium of Badhamia utricularis, advancing 
over the pilei of suitable fungi, feeds on the superficial layer dissolving 
the walls of the hyphae (17). The protoplasm may be seen to 
contain abundant foreign bodies such as spores of fungi or sclerotium 
cysts (vide infra) which have been taken in and are undergoing 
digestion. It has been found experimentally (n) that pieces of 
coagulated proteids are likewise taken in and digested in vacuoles. 
On the other hand it has been found that plasmodia will live, 
ultimately producing sporangia, in nutrient solutions (9). 1 It would 
appear therefore that the nutrition of plasmodia is effected in part 
by the ingestion of solid foodstuffs, and in part by the absorption 
of material in solution, and that there is great variety in the com- 
plexity of the substances which serve as their food. 

Sclerotium. — As the result of drought, the plasmodium, having 
become much denser by loss of water, passes into the sclerotial

sumed. It is to be noted, however, w » The nuclei contained in 
that the sclerotial condition may be the young sclerotial cysts, 
assumed under other conditions than dryness, and sclerotia may 
even be formed in water. 

The existence of the sclerotial stage affords a ready means of 
obtaining the plasmodium for experimental purposes* If a cultiva- 
tion of the plasmodium of Badhamia utricularis on suitable fungi 
(Stereum, Auricularta) is allowed to become partially dry the Plas- 
modium draws^ together and would, if drying were continued, pass 
into the sclerotial stage on the fungus. If now strips of wet blotting- 
paper are placed so as to touch the plasmodium, the latter, attracted 
by the moisture, crawls on the blotting-paper. If this is now removed 
and allowed to dry rapidly, the plasmodium passes into sclerotium 
on it. 2 By this means the plasmodium is removed from the partially 
disintegrated and decayed fungus on which it has been feeding, and 
a clean sclerotium is obtained, which, as above stated, remains alive 
for years (21, p. 7). An easy method for obtaining small plasmodia 
for microscopic examination is to scatter small fragments, scraped 
from a piece of the hard sclerotium, over cover-slips wetted with 
ratn-water and kept in a moist atmosphere. In twelve to twenty- 
four hours small plasmodia will be seen spreading on the cover-slips 
and these may be mounted for observation. 

The plasmodial stage ends by the formation of the sporangia. 
The plasmodium withdraws from the interstices of the material 
among which it has fed, and emerges on the surface in a diffuse or 
concentrated mass. In the case of Badhamia utricularis it may with- 
draw from the fungus on which it has been feeding, or change into 
sporangia on it. The mode of formation of the sporangia will be 
described in the case of Badhamia t some of the chief differences in 
the process and in the structure of the sporangia in other forms 
being subsequently noticed. 

When^ the change to sporangia begins the protoplasm of the 
Plasmodium becomes gradually massed in discrete rounded lobes, 
about a half to one millimeter in diameter and scattered in clusters 
over the area occupied by the plasmodium. The reticulum of 
channels of the plasmodium becomes meanwhile less and less 
marked. When the whole of the protoplasm is drawn in to the 
lobes, the circulation ceases. The lobes are the young sporangia. 
Meanwhile foreign bodies, taken in with the food, are ejected, and 
the protoplasm secretes on its outer surface a pellicle of mucoid, 
transparent substance which dries as the sporangia ripen. This 
invests the young sporangia, and as they rise above the substratum 
falls together at their bases forming the stalks; extended over the 
substratum it forms the hypothallus, and in contact with the 
rounded surface of the sporangium it forms the sporangium-wall. 
While the sporangium-wall is formed externally a secretion of

similar material occurs along branching and anastomosing tracts 
through the protoplasm of the sporangium, giving rise to the 
capilhtium. The greater part of the lime granules pass out of the 
protoplasm and are deposited in the capilhtium, which in the ripe 
sporangia of Badhamia is white and brittle with the contained lime 
(cf. fig. 8). In this genus some granules are found also in the 
sporangium-wall, Strasburger concludes that the sporangium-wall 
of Trickia is a modification of cellulose (29).

It has been stated (16), but the observation requires confirmation, 
that a fusion of the nuclei in pairs occurs early in the development 
of the sporangium.

spores. A spore- wall is soon secreted and the sporangium has now 
resolved itself into a mass of spores, traversed by the strands of 
the capillitium and enclosed in a sporangium- wall, connected with 
the substratum by a stalk. As ripening proceeds, the wall becomes 
membranous and readily ruptures, and the dry spores may be carried 
abroad on the currents of air or washed out by rain.

We may now review some of the main differences in structure 
presented by the sporangia. They may be stalked or sessile (fig.

The condition of the capiliitium is very various. In the Calcari- 
neae the lime may be generally distributed through it (fig. 11), or 
aggregated at the nodes of the network in " lime-knots " (figs. 12 and 
14) or it may be absent from the capiliitium altogether. The 
capiliitium attains its highest development in the Calonemineae 
in which the threads, distinct (in which case they are known as 
elaters, figs. 9 and 10) or united into a network (fig. 20), present 
regular thickenings in the form of spiral bands or transverse bars. 
These threads, altering their shape with varying states ol moisture, 
are efficient agents in distributing the spores. In another group, 
the Anemineae, the capiliitium is absent altogether. 

The Didymiaceae are characterized by the fact that the Hme, 
though present in a granular form in the plasmodium, is deposited 
on the sporangium- wall in the form of crystals, either in radiating 
groups (fig. 15) or in disks (fig. 16). 

In most Endosporeae the sporangia are separate symmetrica! 
bodies, but in many genera a form of fructification occurs in which

the spores are produced in masses of more or less irregular outline, 
retaining in extreme cases much of the diffuse character of the Plas- 
modium. With the spores they contain capiliitium, but there are 
no traces of sporangial walls to be found in their interior. They are 
known as plasmodiocarps (fig. 22). They are characteristic of certain 
species, but in others they may be formed side by side with separate 
sporangia from the same Plasmodium. There is indeed no sharp 
line to be drawn between sporangia and plasmodiocarps. On the 
other hand, the crowded condition of the sporangia of some species 
forms a transition to the large compound fructifications known 
as aethalta (fig. 21). These, either in their young stages or up to 
maturity, retain some evidence of their formation by a coalescence 
of sporangia, and in addition to the capiliitium they are generally 
penetrated by the remains of the walls of the sporangia which have 
thus united. 

Exosporeae. 
It will be convenient to begin our survey of the life-history 

of Ceratiomyxa, the single 
representative of the Exo- 
sporeae, at the stage at 
which the Plasmodium 
emerges from the rotten 
wood in which it has fed. 
At this stage it has been 
observed to spread as a film 
over a slide, and to exhibit 
the network of channels and 
rhythmic flow of the proto- 
plasm in a manner precisely 
similar to that seen in the 
Endosporeae (20, p. 10). It 
soon, however, draws to- 
gether into compact masses, 
from the surface of which 
finger-like or antler-like 
lobes grow upwards. Here 
too the secretion of a trans- 
parent mucoid substance 
occurs, which is at first 
penetrated by the anasto- 
mosing strands of the 
protoplasm, but gradually 
the latter tends more and 
more to form a reticular and

The investing proto- 

{)lasm, with its nuclei, having become arranged in an even 
ayer, undergoes cleavage and thus forms a pavement-like 
layer of protoplasmic masses, each occupied by a single nucleus 



(fig- 23, 6). Each of these masses now grows out perpendicularly 
to the surface of the sporophore. As it does so an envelope is 
secreted, which, closing in about the base forms a slender stalk. 
The minute mass, borne on the stalk, becomes the ellipsoid spore, 
surrounded by the spore-wall. In this manner the whole of the 

Cytoplasmic substance of the Plasmodium is converted into spores, 
ornc on supporting structures (stalks and sporophores), which are 
formed by secretion of the protoplasm. 

In the course of the development of which the external features 
have now been traced nuclear changes occur of which accounts have 
been given by Jahn (14) and by Olive (24 and 25). Jahn has shown 
that prior to the cleavage of the protoplasm a mitotic division of 
the nuclei takes place, the daughter nuclei of which are those 
occupying the protoplasmic masses seen in fig. 2$ 6. 1 After the 
spore has risen on its stalk two further mitotic divisions occur in 
rapid succession, and the four-nucleated condition characteristic 
of the spore of Ceratiomyxa, is thus attained. The spores, on being 
brought into water, soon hatch (fig. 23, d), and the four nuclei 
contained in them undergo a mitotic division. Meanwhile the 
protoplasm divides, at first into four, then into eight masses, and 
the latter acquire flagella, although for some time remaining con- 
nected with their fellows (fig. 23, e-h). On separating each is a free 
zoospore. 

From observation of cultivations of zoospores the impression is 
that here, as in the Endosporeae, they multiply by binary division, 
though no exact observations of the process have been recorded. 
The zoospores lose their flagella and become amoebulae, but the 
fusion of the latter to form plasmodia has not been directly observed 
in Ceratiomyxa^ although from analogy with the Endosporeae it 
can hardly be doubted that such fusions occur. 

Sorophora. 

The Sorophora of Zopf (Acrasiae of Van Tieghem) are a group of 
microscopic organisms inhabit- 
ing the dung of herbivorous 
animals and other decaying 
vegetable matter. As Pinoy 
(26) has shown, the presence of 
a particular species of bacteria 
with the spores is necessary 
for their hatching and as the 
essential food of the amoebulae 
which emerge from them. There 
is no flagellate stage, and it 
is in the form of amoebulae, 
multiplying by fission, that the 
vegetative stage of the Hfe- 
history is passed. At the end 
of this stage numbers of amoe- 
bulae draw together to form 
a " pseudo-plasmodium." This 
appears to be merely an aggre- 
gation of amoebulae prior to 
spore formation. The outlines 
of the individual amoebulae are 
maintained, and there is no fu- 
sion between them, as in the 
formation of the Plasmodium 
of the Euplasmodida. 

In some genera certain of the 
amoebulae constituting the 
pseudo-plasmodium are modi- 
fied into a stalk (simple in 
Guttulina and Dictyostelium, 
branched in Polysphondylium, 
fig. 24, d) f along which the 
other units creep to encyst, 
and become spores at the end „

MYCONIUS, F.— MYDDELTON 



At some stage or other we are led by analogy to expect that a 
division of nuclei would occur in which the number of chromosomes 
would be reduced by one half, that this would be followed by the 
formation of gametes, and that the nuclei of the latter would subse- 
quently fuse in karyogamy. 

It is clear that both in the Endosporeae and Exosporeae a mitotic 
division of nuclei immediately precedes spore-formation. This is 
regarded by Jahn as a reduction division. If this is the case, the 
zoospores or the amoebulae must in some way represent the gametes. 
The fusion of the latter to form plasmodia appears to offer a pro- 
cess comparable with the conjugation of gametes, but though the 
fusion of the protoplasm of the amoebulae has been often observed no 
fusion of their nuclei (karyogamy) has been found to accompany it. 
A fusion of nuclei has indeed been described as occurring in the 
Plasmodium, or at stages in the development of the sporangia or 
sporophores, but in no case can the evidence be regarded as satis- 
factory. 1 Until we have clear evidence on this point the nuclear 
history of the mycetozoa must remain incomplete. 

Jahn's observation of the mitotic division of nuclei preceding 
spore-formation in Ceratiomyxa gives a fixed point for comparison 
of the Exosporeae with the Endosporeae. Starting from this divi- 
sion it seems clear that the spore of Ceratiomyxa is comparable 
with the spore of the Endosporeae except that the nucleus of the 
former has undergone two mitotic divisions.

Plasmodium is emerging to form sporophores. Jahn was at first

rise to proud uses of the word as it appears in various places 
in the Vulgate, whereas Myconius, from the island Myconus, 
was a proverb for meanness. His schooling was in Lichtenfels 
and at Annaberg, where he had a memorable encounter with 
the, Dominican, Tetzel, his point being that indulgences should 
be given pauperibus gratis. His teacher, Staffelstein, persuaded 
him to enter (July 14, 15 10) the Franciscan cloister. That same 
night a pictorial dream turned his thoughts towards the 
religious standpoint which he subsequently reached • as a 
Lutheran. From Annaberg he passed to Franciscan commu- 
nities at Leipzig and Weimar, where he was ordained priest 
(1516); he had endeavoured to satisfy his mind with scholastic 
divinity, but next year his " eyes and ears were- opened " by 
the theses of Luther, whom he met when Luther touched at 
Weimar on his way to Augsburg. For six years he preached 
his new gospel, under difficulties, in various seats of his order, 
lastly at Zwickau, whence he was called to Gotha (Aug. 1524) 
by Duke John at the general desire. Here he married Margaret 
Jacken, a lady of good family. He was intimately connected 
with the general progress of the reforming movement, and 
was especially in the confidence of Luther. Twice he was 
entrusted (1528 and 1533) with the ordering of the churches and 
schools in Thuringia. In all the religious disputations and 
conferences of the time he took a leading part. At the Con- 
vention of Smalkald (1537) he signed the articles on his own 
behalf and that of his friend Justus Menius. In 153S he was in 
England, as theologian to the embassy which hoped to induce 
Henry VIII. on the basis of the Augsburg Confession, to make 
common cause with the Lutheran reformation; a project which 
Myconius caustically observed might have prospered on con- 
dition that Henry was allowed to be pope. Next year he was 
employed in the cause of the Reformation in Leipzig. Not 
the least important part of his permanent work in Gotha was 
the founding and endowment of its gymnasium. In 1541 his 
health was failing, but he lived till the 7th of April 1546. He 
had nine children, four of whom were living in 1542. 

Though he published a good many tracts and pamphlets, Myconius 
was not distinguished as a writer. His Historta reformationis, 
referring especially to Gotha, was not printed till 1715. See Mel- 
chior Adam, Vitae theologorum (1706); J. G. Bosseck, F. Myconii

MYCONIUS, OSWALD (1488-1552), Zwinglian divine, was 
born at Lucerne in 1488. His family name was Geisshiisler; 
his father was a miller; hence he was also called Moutoris. 
The name Myconius seems to have been given him by Erasmus. 
From the school at Rottweil, on the Neckar, he went (1510) 
to the university of Basel, and became a good classic. From 
1 514 he obtained schoolmaster posts at Basel, where he married, 
and made the acquaintance of Erasmus and of Holbein, the 
painter. In 1516 he was called, as schoolmaster, to Zurich, 
where (1518) he attached himself to the reforming party of 
Zwingli. This led to his being transferred to Lucerne, and 
again (1523) reinstated at Zurich. On the death of Zwingli 
(1531) he migrated to Basel, and there held the office of town's 
preacher, and (till 1541) the chair of New Testament exegesis. 
His spirit was comprehensive; in confessional matters he was for 
a union of all Protestants; though a Zwinglian, his readiness 
to compromise with the advocates of consubstantiation gave 
him trouble with the Zwinglian stalwarts. He had, however, 
a distinguished follower in Theodore Bibliander. He died on 
the 14th of October 1552. 

Among his several tractates, the most important is De H. Zwinglii 
vita et obitu (1536), translated into English by Henry Ben net 



(1561). See Melchior Adam, Vita theologorum (1620); M. Kirch-

MYDDELTON (or Middleton), SIR HUGH, Bart. (c. 1560- 

163 1), contractor of the New River scheme for supplying London 

with .water, was a younger son of Sir Richard Myddelton, 

governor of Denbigh Castle. Hugh became a successful London 



MYELAT— MYERS 



in 



goldsmith, occupying a shop in Bassihaw, or Basinghall Street; 
he made money by commercial ventures on the Spanish main, 
being associated in these with Sir Walter Raleigh; and he was 
also interested in cloth-making. He was an alderman, and then 
recorder of Denbigh, and was member of parliament for this 
borough from 1603 to 1628. In 1609 Myddelton took over fr&m 
the corporation of London the projected scheme for supplying 
the city with water obtained from springs near Ware, in Hert- 
fordshire. For this purpose he made a canal about 10 ft. wide 
and 4 ft. deep and over $8 m. in length, which discharged its 
waters into a reservoir at Islington called the New River Head. 
The completion of this great undertaking put a severe strain 
upon Myddelton's financial resources, and in 161 2 he was 
successful in securing monetary assistance from James I. The 
work was completed in 1613 and Myddelton was made the first 
governor of the company, which, however, was not a financial 
success until after his death. In recognition of his services he 
was made a baronet in 1622. Myddelton was also engaged in 
working some lead and silver mines in Cardiganshire and in 
reclaiming a piece of the Isle of Wight from the sea. He died 
on the 10th of December 1631, and was buried in the church of 
St Matthew, Friday Street, London. He had a family of ten 
sons and six daughters. 

One of Sir Hugh's brothers was Sir Thomas Myddelton 
(c. 1550-1631), lord mayor of London, and another was William 
Myddelton (c. 1 556-1621), poet and seaman, whe died at Antwerp 
on .the 27th of March 1621. 

Sir Thomas was a member of parliament under Queen Eliza- 
beth and was chosen lord mayor on the 29th of September 1613, 
the day fixed for the opening of the New River. Under James I. 
and Charles I. he represented the city of London in parliament, 
and he helped Rowland Hcylyn to publish the first popular 
edition of the Bible in Welsh. He died on the 12th of August 
1 63 1. Sir Thomas's son and heir, Sir Thomas Myddelton 
(1586-1666), was a memher of the Long Parliament, being an 
adherent of the popular party. After the outbreak of the Civil 
War he served in Shropshire and in north Wales, gaining a 
signal success over the royalists at Oswestry in July 1644, and 
another at Montgomery in the following September. In 1659, 
however, he joined the rising of the royalists under Sir George 
Booth, and in August of this year he was forced to surrender 
his residence, Chirk Castle. His eldest son, Thomas (d. 1663), 
was made a baronet in 1660, a dignity which became extinct 
when William the 4th baronet died in 17 18. 

MYELAT, a division of the southern Shan States of Burma, 
including sixteen states, none of any great size, with a total 
area of 3723 sq. m., and a population in 1901 of 119,415. 
The name properly means " the unoccupied country," but it 
has been occupied for many centuries. All centraLMyelat and 
great parts of the northern and southern portions consist of 
rolling grassy downs quite denuded of jungle. It has a great 
variey of different races, Taungthus and Danus being perhaps 
the most numerous. They are all more or less hybrid races. The 
chiefs of the Myelat are known by the Burmese title of gwegunh- 
mu y i.e. chiefs paying the revenue in silver. The amount 
paid by the chiefs to the British government is Rs. 99,567. 
The largest state, Loi L6ng, has an area of 1600 sq. m., a great 
part of which is barren hills. The smallest, Nam Hkon, had no 
more than 4 sq. m., and has been recently absorbed in a neigh- 
bouring state. The majority of the states cover less than 
100 sq. m. Under British administration the chiefs have powers 
of a magistrate of the second class. The chief cultivation 
besides rice is sugar-cane, and considerable quantities of crude 
sugar are exported. There is a considerable potato cultivation, 
which can be indefinitely extended when cheaper means of 
export are provided. Wheat also grows very well. 

MYELITIS (from Gr. juueXfo, marrow) a disease which by 
inflammation induces destructive changes in the tissues com- 
posing the spinal cord. In the acute variety the nerve elements 
in the affected part become disintegrated and softened, but 
repair may take place; in the chronic form the change is slower, 
and the diseased area tends to become denser (sclerosed), the 



nerve-substance being replaced by connective tissue. Myelitis 
may affect any portion of the spinal cord, and its symptoms and 
progress will vary accordingly. Its most frequent site is in 
the lower part, and its existence there is marked by the sudden 
or gradual occurrence of weakness of motor power in the legs 
(which tends to pass into complete paralysis), impairment or 
loss of sensibility in the parts implicated, nutritive changes 
affecting the skin and giving rise to bed-sores, together with 
bladder and bowel derangements. In the acute form, in which 
there is at first pain in the region of the spine and much con- 
stitutional disturbance, death may take place rapidly from 
extension of the disease to those portions of the cord connected 
with the muscles of respiration and the heart, from an acute 
bed-sore, which is very apt to form, or from some intercurrent 
disease. Recovery to a certain extent may, however, take 
place; or, again, the disease may pass into the chronic form. 
In the latter the progress is usually slow, the general health 
remaining tolerably good for a time, but gradually the strength 
fails, the patient becomes more helpless, and ultimately sinks 
exhausted or is cut off by some complication. The chief 
causes of myelitis are injuries or diseases affecting the spinal 
column, extension of inflammation from the membranes of the 
cord to its substance (see Meningitis), exposure to cold and 
damp, and occasionally some pre-existing constitutional morbid 
condition, such as syphilis or a fever. Any debilitating cause or 
excess in mode of life will act powerfully in predisposing to this 
malady. The disease is most common in adults. The treatment 
for myelitis in its acute stage is similar to that for spinal 
meningitis. When the disease is chronic the most that can be 
hoped for is the relief of symptoms by careful nursing and 
attention to the condition of the body and its functions. Good 
is sometimes derived from massage and the use of baths and 
douches to the spine. 

MYERS, FREDERIC WILLIAM HENRY (1843-1901), English 
poet and essayist, son of Frederic Myers of Keswick — author of 
Lectures on Great Men (1856) and Catholic Thoughts (first collected 
1873), a book marked by a most admirable prose style — was born 
at Keswick, Cumberland, pn the 6th of February 1843, and edu- 
cated at Cheltenham and Trinity College, Cambridge, where he 
won a long list of honours and in 1865 was appointed classical 
lecturer. He had no love for teaching, which he soon discon- 
tinued, but he took up his permanent abode at Cambridge in 
1872, when he became a school inspector under the Education 
Department. Meanwhile he published, in 1867, an unsuccessful 
essay for the Seatonian prize, a poem entitled St Paul, which met 
at the hands of the general public with a success that would be 
difficult to explain, for it lacks sincerity and represents views 
which the writer rapidly outgrew. It was followed by small 
volumes of collected verses in 1870 and 1882: both are marked 
by a flow of rhetorical ardour which culminates in a poem of 
real beauty, "The Renewal of Youth," in the 1882 collection. 
His best verse is in heroic couplets. Myers is more likely to 
be remembered by bis two volumes of Essays, Classical and 
Modern (1883). The essay on Virgil, by far the best thing he 
ever wrote, represents the matured enthusiasm of a student and 
a disciple to whom the exquisite artificiality and refined culture 
of Virgil's method were profoundly congenial. Next to this in 
value is the carefully wrought essay on Ancient Greek Oracles 
(this had first appeared in Hellenica). Scarcely less delicate 
in phrasing and perception, if less penetrating in insight, is the 
monograph on Wordsworth (18S1) for the " English Men of 
Letters " series. In 1882, after several years of inquiry and 
discussion, Myers took the lead among a small band of explorers 
(including Henry Sidgwick and Richard Hodgson, Edmund 
Gurney and F. Podmore), who founded the society for Psychical 
Research. He continued for many years to be the mouthpiece 
of the society, a position for which his perfervidum ingenium, 
still more his abnormal fluency and alertness, admirably fitted 
him. He contributed greatly to the coherence of the society 
by steering a mid-course between extremes (the extreme sceptics 
on the one hand, and the enthusiastic spiritualists on the 
other), and by helping to sift and revise the cumbrous mass of

MYINGYAN— MYLODON 



Proceedings, the chief concrete results being the two volumes of 
Phantasms of the Living (1886), to which he contributed the in- 
troduction. Like many theorists, he had a faculty for ignoring 
hard facts, and in his anxiety to generalize plausibly upon the 
alleged data, and to hammer out striking formulae, his insight 
into the real character of the evidence may have left something 
to be desired. His long series of papers on subliminal conscious- 
ness, the results of which were embodied in a posthumous work 
called Human Personality and its Survival of Bodily Death (2 vols. 
1903), constitute his own chief contribution to psychical theory. 
This, as he himself would have been the first to admit, was little 
more than provisional; but Professor William James has pointed 
out that the series of papers on subliminal consciousness is " the 
first attempt to consider the phenomena of hallucination, 
hypnotism, automatism, double personality and mediumship, as 
connected parts of one whole subject." The last work published 
in his lifetime was a small collection of essays, Science and a 
Future Life (1893). He died at Rome on the 17th of January 
1 901, but was buried in his native soil at Keswick. 

MYINGYAN, a district in the Meiktila division of Upper 
Burma. It lies in the valley of the Irrawaddy, to the south of 
Mandalay, on the east bank of the river. Area, 3137 sq. m. 
Pop. (1901), 356,052, showing an increase of 1% in the decade 
and a density of 114 inhabitants to the square mile. The greater 
part of the district is flat, especially to the north and along the 
banks of the Irrawaddy. Inland the country rises in gently 
undulating slopes. The most noticeable feature is Popa hill, 
an extinct volcano, in the south-eastern corner of the district. 
The highest peak is 4962 ft. above sea-level. The climate is dry 
and healthy, with high south winds from March till September. 
The annual rainfall averages about 35 in. The temperature 
varies between 106 and 70 F. The ordinary crops are millet, 
sesamum, cotton, maize, rice, gram, and a great variety of peas 
and beans. The district as a whole is not well watered, and most 
of the old irrigation tanks had fallen into disrepair before the 
annexation. There are no forests, but a great deal of low scrub. 
The lacquer ware of Nyaung-u and other villages near Pagan is 
noted throughout Burma. A considerable number of Chinese 
inhabit Myingyan and the larger villages. The headquarters 
town, Myingyan, stands on the Irrawaddy, and had a population 
in 1901 of 16,139. It * s tne terminus of the branch railway 
through Meiktila to the main line from Mandalay to Rangoon. 
The steamers of the Irrawaddy Flotilla Company also call here. 
A cotton-pressing machine was erected here in the time of 
independent Burma, and still exists. 

MYITKYINA, the most northerly of the districts of Upper 
Burma in the Mandalay division, separated from Bhamo district 
in 1895. It is cut up into strips by comparatively low parallel 
ranges of hills running in a general way north and south. The 
chief plain is that of Myitkyina, covering 600 sq. m. To the 
east of the Irrawaddy, which bisects the district, it is low-lying 
and marshy. To the west it rises to a higher level, and is mostly 
dry. Except in the hills inhabited by the Kachin tribes there 
are practically no villages off the line of the Irrawaddy. The 
Indawgyi lake, a fine stretch of water measuring 16 m. by 6, 
lies in the south-west of the district. A very small amount of 
cultivation is carried on, mostly without irrigation. Area, 
10,640 sq. m.; estimated population (1901) 67,399, showing a 
density of six persons to the square mile. More than half the total 
are Kachins, who inhabit the hills on both sides of the Irrawaddy. 
The headquarters town, Myitkyina, had in 1901 a population of 
3618. It is the limit of navigation on the Irrawaddy, and the 
terminus of the railway from Rangoon and Sagaing. 

MYLODON (Gr. for " mill-tooth " from fivtesv and 65ovs), a 
genus of extinct American edentate mammals, typified by a 
species (M. harlani) from the Pleistocene of Kentucky and other 
parts of the United States, but more abundantly represented in 
the corresponding formations of South America, especially 
Argentina and Brazil. The mylodons belong to the group of 
ground-sloths, and are generally included in the family Megath- 
eriidae, although sometimes made the type of a separate family. 
From Megatherium these animals, which rivalled the Indian 



rhinoceros in bulk, differ in the shape of their cheek-teeth; these 
(five above and four below) being much smaller, with an ovate 
section, and a cupped instead of a ridged crown-surface, thus 
resembling those of the .true sloths. In certain species of mylodon 
the front pair of teeth in each jaw is placed some distance in front 
of the rest and has the crown surface obliquely bevelled by 




From Owen. 
Skeleton of Mylodon robustus (Pleistocene, South America). 

wearing against the corresponding teeth in the opposite jaw. On 
this account such species have been referred to a second genus, 
under the name of Leslodon, but the distinction scarcely seems 
necessary. The skull is shorter and lower than in Megatherium^ 
without any vertical expansion of the middle of the lower jaw, 
and the teeth also extend nearly to the front of the jaws; both 
these features being sloth-like. In the fore feet the three inner 
toes have large claws, while the two outer ones are rudimentary 
and clawless; in the hind-limbs the first tee is wanting, as in 
Megatherium, but the second and third are clawed. The skin 
was strengthened by a number of small deeply-embedded bony 
nodules. 

Although the typical M. harlani is North American, the 
mylodons are essentially a South American group, a few of the 
representatives of which effected an entrance into North America 
when that continent became finally connected with South 
America. Special interest attaches to the recent discovery in 
the cavern of Ultima Esperanza, South Patagonia, of remains of 
the genus Glossotherium, or Grypotherium, a near relative of 
Mylodon, but differing from it in having a bony arch connecting 
the nasal bones of the skull with the premaxillae; these include 
a considerable portion of the skin with the hair attached. 
Ossicles somewhat resembling large coffee-berries had been 
previously found in association with the bones of Mylodon, and in 
Glossotherium nearly similar ossicles occur embedded on the 
inner side of the thick hide. The coarse and shaggy hair is 
somewhat like that of the sloths. The remains, which include 
not only the skeleton and skin, but likewise the droppings, were 
found buried in grass which appears to have been chopped 
up by man, and it thus seems not only evident that these 
ground-sloths dwelt in the cave, but that there is a considerable 
probability of their having been kept there in a semi-domesti- 
cated state by the early human inhabitants of Patagonia. The 
extremely fresh condition of the remains has given rise to the 
idea that Glossotherium may still be living in the wilds of 
Patagonia. 

Scelidotherium is another genus of large South American Pleisto- 
cene ground-sloths, characterized, among other features, by the 
elongation and slenderness of the skull, which thus makes a decided 
approximation to the anteater type, although retaining the full 
series of cheek-teeth, which were, of course, essential to an herbi- 
vorous animal. The feet resemble those of Megatherium. A much 
smaller South American species represents the genus Nothrothtrium. 

In North America Mylodon was accompanied by another gigantic 
species typifying the genus Mcgalonyx, in which the fore part of the 
skull was usually wide, and the third and fourth front toes carried 
claws. Another genus has been described from the Pleistocene 



MYLONITE— MYRA 



113 



of Nebraska, as Paramylodon; it has only four pairs of teeth, and an 
elongate skull with an inflated muzzle. All the above genera differ 
from Megatherium in having a foramen on the inner side of the lower 
end of the humerus. A presumed large ground-sloth from Mada- 
gascar has been described, on the evidence of a limb-bone, as Brady- 
therium, but it is suggested by Dr F. Ameghino that the specimen 
really belongs to a lemuroid. Be this as it may, thcNorth Aifierican 
mammals described as M or opus and Morotherium, in the belief that 
they were ground-sloths, are really referable to the ungulate group 
Ancylopoda. 

Although a few of the Pleistocene ground-sloths, such as Nothro- 
pus and Nothrotherium (~Coelodon) t were of comparatively small 
size, in the Santa Cruz beds of Patagonia few of the representatives 
of the family much exceeded a modern sloth in size. The best- 
known generic types are Eucholoeops, Hapalops and Pseudahapalops, 
of which considerable portions of the skeleton have been disinterred. 
In these diminutive ground-sloths the crowns of the cheek-teeth 
approached the prismatic form characteristic of Mega[lo]therium, 
as distinct from the subcylindrical type occurring in Mylodon t 
Glossotheriunty &c. 

By many palaeontologists a group of fNorth American Lower 
Tertiary mammals, known as Ganodonta, has been regarded as 
representing the ancestral stock of the ground-sloths and those of 
other South American edentates; but according to Professor W. B. 
Scott this view is incorrect and there is no affinity between the two 
groups. If this be so, we are still in complete darkness as to the 
stock from which the South American edentates are derived.

MYLONITE (Gr. fiv\&v, a mill), in petrology, a rock which has 
been crushed and ground down by earth movement and at the 
same time rendered compact by pressure. Mylonites are fine- 
grained, sometimes even flinty, in appearance, and often banded 
in parallel fashion with stripes of varying composition. The 
great majority are quartzose rocks, such as quartzite and quartz- 
schist; but in almost any type of rock mylonitic structure may 
be developed. Gneisses of various kinds, hornblende-schists, 
chlorite-schists and limestones are not infrequently found in 
belts of mylonitic rock. The process of crushing by which 
mylonites are formed is known also as " granulitization " and 
" cataclasis," and mylonites are often described as granulites, 
though the two terms are not strictly equivalent in all their 
applications. Mylonites occur in regions where there has 
been considerable metamorphism. Thrust planes and great 
reversed faults are often bounded by rocks which have all been 
crushed to fine slabby mylonites, that split readily along planes 
parallel to the direction in which movement has taken place. 
These " crush-belts " may be only a few feet or several hundred 
yards broad. The movements have probably taken place slowly 
without great rise of temperature, and hence the rocks have not 
recrystallized to any extent. 

Crushing and movement on so extensive a scale are to be expected 
principally in regions consisting of rocks greatly folded and 
compressed. Hence mylonites are commonest in Archean regions, 
but may be found also in Carboniferous and later rocks where the 
necessary conditions have prevailed. Within a short space it is 
often possible to trace rocks from a normal to a highly mylonized 
condition, and to follow by means of the microscope all the stages 
of the process. A sandstone, grit, or fine cjuartzose conglomerate, 
for example, when it approaches a mylonitic zone begins to lose 
its clastic or pebbly structure. The rounded grains of quartz 
become cracked, especially near their edges, and are then surrounded 
by narrow borders, consisting of detached granules: this is due to the 
pebbles being pressed together and forced to pass one another as the 
rock yields to the pressures which overcome its rigidity. Then each 
quartz grain breaks up into a mosaic of little angular fragments; 
the rounded pebbles are flattened out and become lenticular or cake- 
shaped. Finally only a small oval patch of fine interlocking quartz 
grains is left to indicate the position of the pebble, and if the matrix 
is quartzose this gradually blends with it and a uniform fine-grained 
quartzose rock results. If felspar is present it may become crushed 
like quartz, but often tends to recrystallize as quartz and muscovite, 
the minute scales of white mica being parallel to the foliation or 
banding of the rock, and a finely granulitic or mylonitic quartz- 
schist^ is the product. In hornblcndic rocks, such as epiaiorite, 
amphibolite and hornblende-schist, the mineral composition may 
remain unchanged, but very often chlorite, carbonates and biotitc 
develop, epidote and sphene being also frequent. Biotite- and mus- 
covite-gneisses yield very ^ perfect mylonites, in which the micas 
have parallel orientation, giving the rock a flat banding and marked 
schistosity (see Petrology, PI. iv., fig. 6). When these mylonitic 



gneisses contain pink garnet (often with kyanite or sillimanite) 
they pass into normal granulites; limestones, if fossiliferous, become 
changed into finely crystalline masses, often fissile, sometimes with 
lenticular or augen structure. An interesting variety of mylonite, 
developed in granite-porphyry and gneiss, is fine, dark and almost 
vitreous in appearance, consisting mainly of very minute grains of 
quartz and felspar and resembling flint in appearance. These 
form threads and vein-like streaks ramifying through the normal 
rocks. Examples are furnished by the flinty-crushes of west Scot- 
land and the " trap-shotten " gneisses of south India. (J. S. F.) 

MYMENSINGH, or Maimansingh, a district of British India, 
in the Dacca division of Eastern Bengal and Assam. It occupies 
a portion of the alluvial valley of the Brahmaputra east of the 
main channel (called the Jamuna) and north of Dacca. The 
administrative headquarters are at Nasirabad, sometimes called 
Mymensingh town. Area, 6332 sq. m. Pop. (1901), 3,915,068, 
showing an increase of 12-8 % in the decade. The district is 
for the most part level and open, covered with well-cultivated 
fields, and intersected by numerous rivers. The Madhupur 
jungle is a slightly elevated tract, extending from the north of 
Dacca district into the heart of Mymensingh; its average height 
is about 60 ft. above the level of the surrounding country, and it 
nowhere exceeds 100 ft. The jungle contains abundance of sal y 
valuable both as timber and for charcoal. The only other elevated 
tract in the district is on the southern border, where the Susang . 
hills rise. They are for the most part covered with thick thorny 
jungle, but in parts are barren and rocky. The Jamuna forms 
the western boundary of Mymensingh for a course of 94 m. It is 
navigable for large boats throughout the year; and during the 
rainy season it expands in many places to 5 or 6 m. in breadth. 
The Brahmaputra enters Mymensingh at its north-western 
corner near Karaibari, and flows south-east and south till it 
joins the Meghna a little below Bhairab Bazar. The gradual 
formation of chars and bars of sand in the upper part of its course 
has diverted the main volume of water into the present channel 
of the Jamuna, which has in consequence become of much more 
importance than the Brahmaputra proper. The Meghna only 
flows for a short distance through the south-east portion of 
the district, the eastern and south-eastern parts of which 
abound in marshes. The staple crops of the country are rice, 
jute and oil-seeds. A branch line of the Eastern Bengal railway 
runs north from Dacca through Nasirabad, &c, to the Jamuna. 
The district was severely affected by the earthquake of the 
12th of June 1897. 

MYNGS, SIR CHRISTOPHER (1625-1666), British admiral, 
came of a Norfolk family. Pepys* story of his humble birth is 
said to be erroneous. It is probable that he saw a good deal of 
sea-service before 1648. He first appears prominently as the 
captain of the " Elisabeth," which after a sharp action brought 
in a Dutch convoy with two men-of-war as prizes. From 1653 
to 1655 he continued to command the " Elisabeth," high in 
favour with the council of state and recommended for promotion 
by the flag officers under whom he served. In 1655 he was 
appointed to the " Marston Moor," the crew of which was on the 
verge of mutiny. His firm measures quelled the insubordinate 
spirit, and he took the vessel out to the West Indies, where he 
remained for some years. The Restoration government retained 
him in his command, and in 1664 he was made vice-admiral in 
Prince Rupert's squadron. As vice-admiral of the White he flew 
his flag at Lowestoft in 1665, and for his share in that action 
received the honour of knighthood. In the following year he 
served under the new lord high admiral, Sandwich, as vice- 
admiral of the Blue. He was on detachment with Prince Rupert 
when the great Four Days' Battle began, but returned to the 
main fleet in time to take part, and in this action he received a 
wound of which he died.

is not known, and it does not play any part of importance in 
either Greek or Roman annals. Its fame begins with Chris- 
tianity. There St Paul touched on his last journey westward 
(a.d. 62), and changed into " a ship of Alexandria sailing into 
Italy." In the 3rd century the great St Nicholas, born at 
Patara, was its bishop, and he died and was buried at Myra. His 
tomb is still shown, but his relics are supposed to have been trans- 
lated to Bari in Italy in the nth century. Theodosius II. made 
Myra the Byzantine capital of Lycia, and as such it was besieged 
and taken by Harun al-Rashid in 808. The town seems shortly 
afterwards to have decayed. A small Turkish village occupied 
the plain at the foot of the acropolis, and a little Greek monastery 
lay about a mile westward by the church of St Nicholas. The 
latter has formed the nucleus of modern Dembre, which has 
been increased by settlers from the Greek island of Castel6rizo. 
Myra has three notable sights, its carved cliff-cemetery, its 
theatre, and its church of St Nicholas. The first is the most 
remarkable of the Lycian rock-tomb groups. The western scarp 
of the acropolis has been sculptured into a number of sepulchres 
imitating wooden houses with pillared facades, some of which 
have pediment reliefs and inscriptions in Lycian. The theatre 
lies at the foot of this cliff and is partly excavated out of it, 
partly built. It, is remarkable for the preservation of its corri- 
dors. The auditorium is perfect in the lower part, and the 
scena still retains some of its decoration — both columns and 
carved entablature. The church of St Nicholas lies out in 
the plain, at the western end of Dembre, near a small monastery 
and new church recently built with Russian money. Its floor 
is far below the present level of the plain, and until recently the 
church was half filled with earth. The excavation of it was 
undertaken by Russians about 1894 and it cost Dembre dear; 
for the Ottoman government, suspicious of foreign designs on 
the neighbouring harbour of Kekova, proceeded to inhibit all 
sale of property in the plain and to place Dembre under a minor 
state of siege. The ancient church is of the domed basilica 
form with throne and seats still existent in the tribunal. In 
the south aisle as a tomb with marble balustrade which is pointed 
out as that wherein St Nicholas was laid. The locality of the 
tomb is very probably genuine, but its present ornament, as 
well as the greater part of the church, seems of later date (end 
of 7th century ?). None the less this is among the most interest- 
ing early Christian churches in Asia Minor. There are also 
extensive ruins of Andriaca, the port of Myra, about 3 m. west, 
containing churches, baths, and a great grain store, inscribed 
with Hadrian's name. They he along the course of the Andraki 
river, whose navigable estuary is still fringed with ruinous 
quays.

(D. G. H.) 

MYRIAPODA (Gr. for " many-legged "), arthropod animals 
of which centipedes and millipedes are familiar examples. 
Linnaeus included them in his Insecta Aptera together with 
Crustacea and Arachnida; in 1796 P. A. Latreille designated 
them as Myriopoda, making of them, along with the Crustacean 
Oniscus, one of the seven orders into which he divided the 
Aptera of Linnaeus. Later on J. C. Savigny, by study of the 
mouth-parts, clearly distinguished them from Insects and Crus- 
tacea. In 18 14 W. E. Leach defined them and divided them into 
Centipedes and Millipedes. In 1825 Latreille carried further 
the observations of Leach, and suggested that the two groups 
were very distinct, the millipedes being nearer Crustacea and 
the centipedes approaching Arachnida and Insecta. Although 
Latreille's suggestion has not been adopted, it is recognized that 
centipedes and millipedes are too far apart to be united as 
Myriapoda, and they are now treated as separate classes of 
the Arthropoda. See Centipede (Chilopoda) and Millipede 
- (Diplopoda). 

MYRMIDONES, in Greek legend, an Achaean race, in Homeric 
times inhabiting Phthiotis in Thessaly. According to the ancient 
tradition, their original home was Aegina, whence they crossed 
over to Thessaly with Peleus, but the converse view is now 
more generally accepted. Their name is derived from a supposed 



ancestor, son of Zeus and Eurymedusa, who was wooed by the 
god in the form of an ant (Gr. juup;u7?£); or from the repeopling 
of Aegina (when all its inhabitants had died of the plague) with 
ants changed into men by Zeus at the prayer of Aeacus, king of 
the island. The word " myrmidon " has passed into the 
English language to denote a subordinate who carries out the 
orders of his superior without mercy or consideration for others. 
See Strabo viii. 375, ix. 433; Homer, Iliad, ii. 681 ; schol. on Pindar 
Nem. iii. 21 ; Clem. Alex., Protrepticon, p. 34, ed. Potter. 

MYROBALANS, the name given to the astringent fruits of 
several species of Terminalia, largely used in India for dyeing 
and tanning and exported for the same purpose. They are 
large deciduous trees and belong to the family Combretaceae. 
The chief kinds are the chebulic or black myrobalan, from 
Terminalia Chebula, which are smooth, and the beleric, from 
T. belerica, which are five-angled and covered with a greyish 
down. 

MYRON, a Greek sculptor of the middle of the 5th century B.C. 
He was born at Eleutherae on the borders of Boeotia and Attica. 
He worked almost exclusively in bronze: and though he made 
some statues of gods and heroes, his fame rested principally upon 
his representations of athletes, in which he made a revolution, by 
introducing greater boldness of pose and a more perfect rhythm. 
His most famous works according to Pliny (Nat. Hist., 34, 57) 
were a cow, Ladas the runner, who fell dead at the moment of 
victory, and a discus-thrower. The cow seems to have earned 
its fame mainly by serving as a peg on which to hang epigrams, 
which tell us nothing about the pose of the animal. Of the 
Ladas there is no known copy. But we are fortunate in pos- 
sessing several copies of the discobolus, of which the best is in 
the Massimi palace at Rome (see Greek Art, PL iv. fig. 68). 
The example in the British Museum has the head put on wrongly. 
The athlete is represented at the moment when he has swung 
back the discus with the full stretch of his arm, and is about to 
hurl it with the full weight of his body. The head should be 
turned back toward the discus. 

A marble figure in the Lateran Museum (see Greek Art, 
PL -iii. fig. 64), which is now restored as a dancing satyr, is 
almost certainly a copy of a work of Myron, a Marsyas desirous 
of picking up the flutes which Athena had thrown away (Pausa- 
nias, i. 24, 1). The full group is copied on coins of Athens, on 
a vase and in a relief which represent Marsyas as oscillating 
between curiosity and the fear of the displeasure of Athena. 

The ancient critics say of Myron that, while he succeeded 
admirably in giving life and motion to his figures, he did not 
succeed in rendering the emotions of the mind. This agrees 
with the extant evidence, in a certain degree, though not per- 
fectly. The bodies of his men are of far greater excellence than 
the heads. The face of the Marsyas is almost a mask; but from 
the attitude we gain a vivid impression of the passions which 
sway him. The face of the discus-thrower is calm and unruffled; 
but all the muscles of his body are concentrated in an effort. 

A considerable number of other extant works are ascribed to 
the school or the influence of Myron by A. Furtwangler in his 
suggestive Masterpieces of Greek Sculpture (pp. 168-219). These 
attributions, however, are anything but certain, nor do the 
arguments by which Furtwangler supports his attributions bear 
abridgment. 

A recently discovered papyrus from Egypt informs us that 
Myron made statues of the athlete Timanthes, victorious at 
Olympia in 456 B.C., and of Lycinus, victorious in 448 and 444. 
This helps us to fix his date. He was a contemporary, but a 
somewhat older contemporary, of Pheidias and Polyclitus.

MYRRH (from the Latinized form myrrha of Gr. ixvfrpa.) the 
Arabic murr> bitter, was applied to the substance from its 
bitterness), a gum-resin highly esteemed by the ancients as an 
unguent and perfume, used for incense in temples and also in 
embalming. It was one of the gifts offered by the Magi, and a 
royal oblation of gold, frankincense and myrrh is still annu- 
ally presented by the sovereign on the feast of Epipbany 
in the Chapel Royal in London, this custom having been in

existence certainly as early as the reign of Edward I. 1 True 
myrrh is the product of Balsamodendron {Commiphora) Myrrha, 
a small tree of the natural order Amyridaceae that grows in 
eastern Africa and Arabia, but the name is also applied, to gum 
resins obtained from other species of Balsamodendi on. 

I. Baisa Bol, Bkesa Bol or Bissa Bol, from Balsamodendron 
Kataf t resembles true myrrh in appearance, but has a disagreeable 
taste and is scarcely bitter. It is used in China, mixed with food, 
to give to milch cows to improve the quality and increase the 
quantity of milk, and when mixed with lime as a size to impart a 
gloss to walls. (2) Opaque bdellium produced by B. Playfairii, 
when shaken with water forms a slight but permanentlather, and on 
this account is used by the Somali women for cleansing their hair, 
and by the men to whiten their shields ; it is known as meena h&rma 
in Bombay, and was formerly used there for the expulsion of the 
guinea-worm. (3) African bdellium is from B. africannm. and like 
opaque bdellium lacks the white streaks which are characteristic 
of myrrh and bissa bol, both are acrid, but have scarcely any bitter- 
ness or aroma. (4) Indian bdellium, probably identical with the 
Indian drug googul obtained in Sind and Baluchistan from B. Mukul 
and B. pubescens, Hook, is of a dark reddish colour, has an acrid 
taste and an odour resembling cedar-wood, and softens in the hand. 

As met with in commerce true myrrh occurs in pieces of 
irregular size and shape, from § in. to 2 or 3 in. in diameter, 
and of a reddish-brown colour. The transverse fracture has a 
resinous appearance with white streaks; the flavour is bitter 
and aromatic, and the odour characteristic. It consists of a 
mixture of resin, gum and essential oil, the resin being present to 
the extent of 25 to 40%, with 2^ to 8% of the oil, myrrhol, to 
which the odour is due. 

Myrrh has the properties of other substances which, like it, 
contain a volatile oil. Its only important application in medi- 
cine is as a carminative to lessen the griping caused by some 
purgatives such as aloes. The volatile oils have for centuries 
been regarded as of value in disorders of the reproductive 
organs, and the reputation of myrrh in this connexion is simply 
a survival of this ancient but ill-founded belief . 

MYRTLE, the fivpros of the Greeks, the myrtas of the 
Romans, and the myrtle, Myrtus communis (see fig.), of botanists, 
as now found growing wild in many parts of the Mediterranean 
region, doubtless all belong to one and the same species. It is a 
low-growing, evergreen shrub, with opposite leaves, varying in

dimensions, but always small, simple, dark-green, thick in tex- 
ture, and. studded with numerous receptacles for oil. When the 
leaf is held up to the light it appears as if perforated with pin-

holes owing to the translucency of these oil-cysts. The fragrance 
of the plant clepends upon the presence of this oil. Another 
peculiarity of the myrtle is the existence of a prominent vein 
running round the leaf within the margin. The flowers are 
borne on short stalks in the axils of the leaves. The flower-stalk 
is dilated at its upper end into a globose or ovoid receptacle 
enclosing the 2- to 4-partitioned ovary. From its margin pro-, 
ceed the five sepals, and within them the five rounded, spoon- 
shaped, spreading, white petals. The stamens spring from the 
receptacle within the petals and are very numerous, each consist- 
ing of a slender white filament and a small yellow two-lobed 
anther. The style surmounting the ovary is slender, terminating 
in a small button-like stigma. The fruit is a purplish berry, 
consisting of the receptacle and the ovary blended into one 
succulent investment enclosing very numerous minute seeds. 
The embryo-plant within the seed is usually curved. In cultiva- 
tion many varieties are known, dependent on variations in the 
size and shape of the leaves, the presence of so-called double 
flowers, &c. The typical species is quite hardy in the south of 
England. The Chilean species, M. Ugni, a shrub with ovate, 
dark green leaves and white flowers succeeded by globular red or 
black glessy truit with a pleasant smell and taste, is a greenhouse 
shrub, hardy in south-west Britain. The common myrtle is 
the sole representative in Europe of a large genus which has its 
headquarters in extra-tropical South America, whilst other 
members are found in Australia and New Zealand. The genus 
Myrtus also gives its name to a very large natural order, 
Myrtaceae, the general floral structure of which is like that of 
the myrtle above described, but there are great differences in 
the nature of the fruit or seed-vessel according as it is dry or 
capsular, dehiscent, indehiscent or pulpy; minor differences exist 
according to the way in which the stamens are arranged. The 
aromatic oil to which the myrtle owes its fragrance, and its use in 
medicine and the arts, is a very general attribute of the order, as 
may be inferred from the fact that "the order includes, amongst 
other genera, Eucalyptus (q.v.), Pimenta and Eugenia (cloves). 
Myrtol, a constituent of myrtle oil, has been given in doses of 
5-15 minims on sugar or in capsules for pulmonary tuberculosis, 
fetid bronchitis, bronchiectasis, and similar conditions. It 
appears to lessen expectoration in such cases. . The leaves of 
Myrtus chekan arc aromatic and expectorant, and have been used 
in chronic bronchitis. 

MYSIA, the district of N.W. Asia Minor in ancient times 
inhabited by the Mysi. It was bounded by Lydia and Phrygia 
on the S., by Bithynia on the N.E., and by the Propontis and 
Aegean Sea on the N. and W. But its precise limits are difficult 
to assign, the Phrygian frontier being vague and fluctuating, 
while in the north-west the Troad was sometimes included in 
Mysia, sometimes not. Generally speaking, the northern portion 
was known as Mysia Minor or Hellespontica and the southern as 
Major or Pergamene. 

The chief physical features of Mysia (considered apart from 
that of the Troad) are the two mountain-chains, Olympus 
(7600 ft.) in the north and Temnus in the south, which for some 
distance separates Mysia from Lydia, and is afterwards prolonged 
through Mysia to the neighbourhood of the Gulf of Adramyttium. 
The only considerable rivers are the Macestus and its tributary 
the Rhyndacus in the northern part of the province, both of 
which rise in Phrygia, and, after diverging widely through 
Mysia, unite their waters below the lake of Apollonia about 15 m. 
from the Propontis. The Caicus in the south rises in Temnus, 
and from thence flows westward to the Aegean Sea, passing 
within a few miles of Pergamum. In the northern portion of 
the province are two considerable lakes, Artynia or Apolloniatis 
(Abulliont Geul), and Aphnitis (Maniyas Geul), which discharge 
their waters into the Macestus from the east and west 
respectively. 

The most important cities were Pergamum (q.v.) in the valley 
of the Caicus, and Cyzicus (q.v.) on the Propontis. But the whole 
sea-coast was studded with Greek towns, several of which were 
places of considerable importance; thus the northern portion 
included Parium, Lampsacus and Abydos, and the southern

Assus, Adramyttium, and farther south, on the Elaitic Gulf, 
Elaea, Myrina and Cyme. 

Ancient writers agree in describing the Mysians as a distinct 
pecple, like the Lydians and Phrygians, though they never 
appear in history as an independent nation. It appears from 
Herodotus and Strabo that they were kindred with the Lydians 
and Carians, a fact attested by their common participation in 
the sacred rites at the great temple of Zeus at Labranda, as well 
as by the statement of the historian Xanthus of Lydia that their 
language was a mixture of Lydian and Phrygian. Strabo was 
of opinion that they came originally from Thrace (cf. Bithynia), 
and were a branch of the same people as the Mysians or Moesians 
(see Moesia) who dwelt on the Danube — a view not inconsistent 
with the preceding, as he considered the Phrygians and Lydians 
also as having migrated from Europe into Asia. According 
to a Carian tradition reported by Herodotus (i. 171) Lydus and 
Mysus were brothers of Car — an idea which also points to the 
belief in a common origin of the three nations. The Mysians 
appear in the list of the Trojan allies in Homer and are repre- 
sented as settled in the Caicus valley at the coming of Telephus 
to Pergamum; but nothing else is known of their early history. 
The story told by Herodotus (vii. 20) of their having invaded 
Europe in conjunction with the Teucrians before the Trojan 
War is probably a fiction; and the first historical fact we learn 
is their subjugation, together with all the surrounding nations, 
by Lydian Croesus. After the fall of the Lydian monarchy they 
remained under the Persian Empire until its overthrow by 
Alexander. After his death they were annexed to the Syrian 
monarchy, of which they continued to form a part until the defeat 
of Antiochus the Great (190 B.C.), after which they were trans- 
ferred by the Romans to the dominion of Eumenes of Pergamum. 
After the extinction of the Pergamenian dynasty (130 B.C.) 
Mysia became a part of the Roman province of Asia, and from 
this time disappears from history. The inhabitants probably 
became gradually Hellenized, but none of the towns of the 
interior, except Pergamum, ever attained to any importance.

MYSLOWITZ, a town of Germany, in the Prussian province 
of Silesia. Pop. (1905) , 1 5,845. It lies on the navigable Przemsa, 
across which an iron bridge leads to the Polish town of Modr- 
zejow, 120 m. S.E. from Breslau by rail, and an important 
junction of lines to Oswiecim-Lemberg and Vienna. It contains 
a Protestant and three Roman Catholic churches, a palace and 
a gymnasium, and other schools. Extensive coal-mines are 
worked, and among its other industries are flax-spinning and 
brick-making. It became a town in 1857. 

See Lustig, Geschichte von Myslowitz (Myslowitz, 1867). 

MYSORE, a native state of southern India, almost surrounded 
by the Madras presidency, but in political relations with the 
governor-general. It is naturally divided into two regions of 
distinct character — the hill country called the Malnad, on the 
west, and the more open country known as the Maidan, compris- 
ing the greater part of the state, where the wide-spreading 
valleys- and plains are covered with villages and populous towns. 
The drainage of the country, with a slight exception, finds its 
way into the Bay of Bengal, and is divisible into three great 
river systems — that of the Kistna on the north, the Cauvery on 
the south, and the Northern and Southern Pennar and Palar 
on the east. Owing to either rocky or shallow beds none of 
the Mysore rivers is navigable, but some are utilized for floating 
down timber at certain seasons. The main streams, especially 
the Cauvery and its tributaries, support an extensive system 
of irrigation by means of channels drawn from immense dams 
(anicuts), which retain the water at a high level and permit only 
the overflow to pass down stream. The streams which gather 
from the hill-sides and fertilize the valleys are embanked at 
every favourable point in such a manner as to form a series of 
reservoirs or tanks, the outflow from one at a higher level supply- 
ing the next lower, and so on, all down the course of the stream 



at short intervals. These tanks, varying in size from small 
ponds to extensive lakes, are dispersed throughout the country 
to the number of 20,000; the largest is the Sulekere lake, 40 m. 
in circumference. 

Mysore is perhaps the most prosperous native state in India. 
Situated on a healthy plateau, it receives the benefit of both 
the south-west and north-east monsoons, a natural advantage 
which, in conjunction with its irrigation system, has brought to 
Mysore a larger degree of immunity from famine than almost 
any other internal tract of India (always excepting the great 
calamity of 1 876-1 87 7, when one-fourth of the population are 
believed to have perished). Coffee, sandal-wood, silk, gold 
and ivory are among the chief products. The famous Kolar 
gold-fields are worked by electric power, which is conveyed 
for a distance of 92 m. from the Cauvery Falls. This was the 
first electric power scheme of magnitude in Asia. A long 
period of administration by British officers led to the introduction 
of a system based on British models, which has been maintained 
under a series of exceptionally able native ministers, and the 
state can boast of public works, hospitals, research laboratories, 
&c, unsurpassed in India. 

The total area of the state is 29,433 S Q- m -> subdivided into 
8 districts, namely: Bangalore, Kolar, Tumkur, Mysore, Hassan, 
Kadur, Shimoga and Chitaldrug. Pop. (1901), 5,539,399, 
showing an increase of 18% between i88r and 1891, and 
of 12% between 1891 and 1901. The proportion of Hindus 
(92-1%) is larger than in any province of India, showing 
how ineffectual was the persecution of Hyder and Tippoo. 
The Christians (apart from native converts, who are chiefly 
Roman Catholics) largely consist of the garrison at Bangalore, 
the families of military pensioners at the same town, coffee- 
planters and gold-miners. The finances of the state have 
been very successfully managed under native rule, assisted by 
large profits from railways and gold-mines. The revenue 
amounts to about £1,400,000, of which nearly half is derived 
from land. In accordance with the " instrument of transfer," 
Mysore pays to the British government a tribute of £234,000, 
as contribution to military defence; but the full amount was not 
exacted until 1896. The state maintains a military force, 
consisting of two regiments of silladar cavalry and three bat- 
talions of infantry — total, about 2800 men; and also a regiment 
of imperial service lancers, with a transport corps. An interest- 
ing political experiment has been made, in the constitution of 
a representative assembly, composed of 350 representatives of 
all classes of the community, who meet annually to hear an 
account of the state administration for the previous year. The 
assembly has no power to enact laws, to vote supplies, or to pass 
any resolution binding upon the executive. But it gives to the 
leading men of the districts a pleasant opportunity of visiting 
the capital, and to a limited extent brings the force of public 
opinion to bear upon the minister. Since 1891 this representa- 
tive assembly has been elected by local boards and other public 
bodies. 

In the earliest historical times the northern part of Mysore was 
held by the Kadamba dynasty, whose capital, Banawasi, is 
mentioned by Ptolemy; they reigned with more or less splendour 
during fourteen centuries, though latterly they became feuda- 
tories of the Chalukyas. The Cheras were contemporary with 
the Kadambas, and governed the southern part of Mysore till 
they were subverted by the Cholas in the 8th century. Another 
ancient race, the Pallavas, held a small portion of the eastern side 
of Mysore, but were overcome by the Chalukyas in the 7th cen- 
tury. These were overthrown in the 12th century by the Ballalas 
(Hoysalas), an enterprising and warlike race professing the Jain 
faith. They ruled over the greater part of Mysore, and portions ' 
of the modern districts of Coimbatore, Salem and Dharwar, with 
their capital at Dwarasamudra (the modern Halebid); but in 
1310 the Ballala king, was captured by Malik Kafur, the general 
of Ala-ud-din; and seventeen years later the town was entirely 
destroyed by another force sent by Mahommed Tughlak. After 
the subversion of the Ballala dynasty, a new and powerful 
Hindu sovereignty arose at Vijayanagar on the Tungabhadra. 



MYSORE— MYSTERY

In 1565 a confederation of the Mahommedan kingdoms de- 
feated the Vijayanagar sovereign at the battle of Talikota; and 
his descendants ultimately became extinct as a ruling house. 
During the feeble reign of the last king, the petty local chiefs 
(palegars) asserted their independence. The most important of 
these was the wcdeyar of Mysore, who in 1610 seized the fort of 
Seringapatam, and so laid the foundation of the present state. 
His fourth successor, Chikka Deva Raja, during a reign of 
34 years, made his kingdom one of the most powerful in 
southern India. In the middle of the 18th century the famous 
Mahommedan adventurer Hyder Ali usurped the throne, and 
by his military prowess made himself one of the most powerful 
princes of India. His dynasty, however, was as brief as it 
was brilliant, and ended with the defeat and death of his son 
Tippoo at Seringapatam in 1799. A representative of. the 
ancient Hindu line was then replaced on the throne. This 
prince, Krishnaraja Wodeyar, was only five years old, and until 
he came of age in 181 1 the state was under the administration 
of Purnaiya, the Brahman minister of Hyder and Tippoo. 
When Krishnaraja took over the management of his state he 
received an orderly and contented principality with a surplus 
of two crores of rupees. Within twenty years he had driven 
his subjects into rebellion and involved himself and his state 
in heavy debt. The British government therefore assumed 
the administration in 1831, and placed it in the hands of com- 
missioners. In 1862 no less than 88 lakhs of state debts and of 
the maharaja's own liabilities had been liquidated; the entire 
administration had been reformed, a revised system of land 
revenue introduced, and many public works executed. The 
maharaja therefore pressed his claims to a restoration of his 
powers, but the British government refused the application as 
incompatible with the true interests of the people of Mysore, 
and as not justified by any treaty obligation. In the same year 
Chamarajendra Wodeyar, afterwards maharaja, was born of 
the Bettada Kote branch of the ruling house; and in June 1865 
Maharaja Krishnaraja adopted him as his son and successor, 
although he had been informed that no adoption could be 
recognized except to his own private property, already once 
more heavily weighted with private debts. In 1867 the policy 
of government underwent a change; it was determined to secure 
the continuance of native rule in Mysore, by acknowledging 
the adoption upon certain conditions which would secure to the 
people the continued benefits of good administration enjoyed 
by them under British control. The old maharaja died on the 
27th of March 1868, and Chamarajendra Wodeyar was publicly 
installed as the future ruler of Mysore on the 23rd of September 
1868. His education was taken in hand, abuses which had grown 
up in the palace establishment were reformed, the late maharaja's 
debts were again paid off, and the whole internal administration 
perfected in every branch during the minority. On the 25th of 
March 1881 Maharaja Chamarajendra, having attained the age 
of 18 years, was publicly entrusted with the administration of 
the state. He made over to the British government, with full 
jurisdiction, a small tract of land at Bangalore, forming the 
" civil and military station," and received in return the island of 
Seringapatam. But the most important incident of the change 
was the signing of the " instrument of transfer," by which 
the young maharaja, for himself and his successors, undertook 
to perform the conditions imposed upon him. To that agree- 
ment the maharaja steadfastly adhered during his reign, and 
the instrument is a landmark in the history of British relations 
with the protected states of India. The maharaja's first 
minister was Ranga Charlu, who had been trained in the 
British administration of Mysore. He signalized the restoration 
of native rule by creating the representative assembly. In 
1883 Sheshadri Aiyar succeeded Ranga Charlu, and to him 
Mysore is indebted for the extension of railways and schemes of 
irrigation, the development of the Kolar goldfields, and the 
maintenance of the high standard of its administration. The 
maharaja died at Calcutta on the 28th of December 1894. His 
eldest son, Krishnaraja Wodeyar, born in 1884, succeeded him, 
and his widow, Maharani Vanivilas, was appointed regent, 



until in 1902 the maharaja was formally invested with full 
powers by the viceroy in person.

MYSORE, capital of the state of Mysore, India, 10 m. S.W. of 
Seringapatam on the Mysore State railway. Pop. (1901), 68,111. 
The city, which is spread over an area of about 7! sq. m., has its 
nucleus at the foot of the Chamundi hill, in a valley formed by 
two parallel ridges running north and south. The fort stands 
in the south of the town, forming a quarter by itself; the ground- 
plan is quadrangular, each of the sides being about 450 yds. long. 
The old palace of the maharaja within the fort, built in an 
extravagant style of Hindu architecture, was partly destroyed 
by fire in 1897, whereupon a new palace was built on the same 
site. The principal object of interest in the old palace was the 
throne, which is said to have been presented to Chikka Deva Raj 
by the emperor Aurangzeb. The houses of the European residents 
are for the most part to the east of the town. The residency or 
government house was built in 1805. The building afterwards 
used for the district offices was originally built by Colonel 
Wellesley (duke of Wellington) for his own occupation. The 
domed building for the public offices in Gordon Park, the 
Maharaja's College, the Victoria Jubilee Institute, and the law 
courts are conspicuous. Mysore, though the dynastic capital 
of the state, was superseded by Seringapatam as the seat of the 
court from 1610 to 1799, and in 1831, on the British occupation, 
the seat of administration was removed to Bangalore. 

MYSTERY (Gr. ixxxrrqpiov, from fxxxrrrjs, an initiate, pvew, 
to shut the mouth), a general English term for what is secret 
and excites wonder, derived from the religious sense (see below). 
It is not to be confounded with the other old word " mystery," 
or more properly " mistery," meaning a trade or handicraft 
(Lat. ministerium, Fr. mttier). For the medieval plays, called 
mysteries, see Drama; they were so called (Skeat) because acted 
by craftsmen. 

Greek Mysteries. — It is important to obtain a clear conception 
of the exact significance of the Greek term ixvarfipiov, which is 
often associated and at times appears synonymous with the words 
Ttkerrj, opyia. We may interpret " mystery " in its original 
Greek meaning as a " secret " worship, to which only certain 
specially prepared people — ot fxvrjdkvres — were admitted after a 
special period of purification or other preliminary probation, and 
of which the ritual was so important and perilous that the 
" catechumen " needed a hierophant or expounder to guide him 
aright. In the ordinary public worship of the state or the private 
worship of the household the sacrifice with the prayer was the 
chief act of the ceremony; in the " mysterion " something other 
than a sacrifice was of the essence of the rite; something was 
shown to the eyes of the initiated, the mystery was a dpajxa 
jjlv<ttik6v, and dpav and dfnjapxxrvvrj are verbal terms expressive 
of the mystic act. We have an interesting account given us by 
Theo Smyrnaeus 1 of the various elements and moments of the 
normal mystic ceremony: first is the KaBappfa or preliminary 
purification; secondly, the Tchenjs irapASotns, the mystic com- 
munication which probably included some kind of X670S, a 
sacred exegesis or exhortation; thirdly, the kiroirTda or the 
revelation to sight of certain holy things, which is the central 
point of the whole; fourthly, the crowning with the garland, 
which is henceforth the badge of the privileged; and finally, 
that which is the end and object of all this, the happiness that 
arises from the friendship or communion with the deity. This 
exposition is probably applicable to the Greek mysteries in 
general, though it may well have been derived from his know- 
ledge of the Eleusinian. We may supplement it by a statement 
of Lucian's that " no mystery was ever celebrated without 
dancing " (De saltat. 15), which means that it was in some sense 
a religious drama, ancient Greek dancing being generally 
mimetic, and represented some Up6s X670S or sacred story as 
the theme of a mystery-play. 

Before we approach the problem as to the content of the 
mysteries, we may naturally raise the question why certain

MYSTERY 



ancient cults in Greece were mystic, others open and public. 
An explanation often offered is that the mystic cults are the 
Pelasgic or pre-Hellenic and that the conquered populations 
desired to shroud their religious ceremonies from the profane 
eyes of the invaders. But we should then expect to find them 
administered chiefly by slaves and the lower population; on the 
contrary they are generally in the hands of the noblest families, 
and the evidence that slaves possessed in any of them the right 
of initiation is only slight. Nor docs the explanation in other 
respects fit the facts at all. The deities who are worshipped 
with mystic rites have in most cases Hellenic names and do not 
all belong to. the earliest stratum of Hellenic religion. Besides 
those of Demctcr, by far the most numerous in the Hellenic 
world, we have record of the mysteries of Ge at Phlye in Attica, 
of Aglauros and the Charities at Athens, of Hecate at Aegina; 
a shrine of Artemis Mtxn'a on the road between Sparta and 
Arcadia points to a mystic cult of this goddess, and we can infer 
the existence of a similar worship of Themis. Now these are 
either various forms of the earth-goddess, or are related closely 
to her, being powers that we call " chthonian," associated with 
the world below, the realm of the dead. We may surmise then 
that the mystic setting of a cult arose in many cases from the 
dread of the religious miasma which emanated from the nether 
world and which suggested a prior ritual of purification as neces- 
sary to safeguard the person before approaching the holy presence 
or handling certain holy objects. This would explain the 
necessity of mysteries in the worship of Dionysus also, the Cretan 
Zagreus, Trophonius at Lebadeia, Palaemon-Melicertes on the 
Isthmus of Corinth. They might also be necessary for those 
who desired communion with the deified ancestor or hero, and 
thus we hear of the mysteries of Dryops at Asine, of Antinoiis 
the favourite of Hadrian at Mantineia. Again, where there was 
hope or promise that the mortal should by communion be able 
to attain temporarily to divinity, so hazardous an experiment 
would be safeguarded by special preparation, secrecy and 
mystic ritual; and this may have been the prime motive of the 
institution of the Attis-Cybele mystery. (See Great Mother 
of the Gods.) 

For the student of Hellenism, the Eleusinian and Orphic 
ceremonies are of paramount importance; the Samothracian, 
which vied with these in attractiveness for the later Hellenic 
world, were not Hellenic in origin, nor wholly hellenized in char- 
acter, and cannot be considered in an article of this compass. 

As regards the Eleusinia, we are in a better position for the 
investigation of them than our predecessors were; for the modern 
methods of comparative religion and anthropology have at least 
taught us to asK the right questions and to apply relevant 
hypotheses; archaeology, the study of vases, excavations on the 
site, yielding an ever-increasing hoard of inscriptions, have 
taught us much concerning the external organization of the 
mysteries, and have shown us the beautiful figures of the deities 
as they appeared to the eye or to the mental vision of the 
initiated. 

As regards the inner content, the secret of the mystic celebra- 
tion, it is in the highest degree unlikely that Greek inscriptions or 
art would ever reveal it; the Eleusinian scenes that appear on 
Attic vases of about the 5th century cannot be supposed to show 
us the heart of the mystery, for such sacrilegious rashness would 
be dangerous for the vase-painter. If we are to discover it, we 
must turn to the ancient literary records. These must be 
handled with extreme caution and a more careful scrutiny than 
is often applied. We must not expect full enlightenment from 
the Pagan writers, who convey to us indeed the poetry and the 
glow of this fascinating ritual, and who attest the deep and puri- 
fying influence that it exercised upon the religious temperament, 
■ but who are not likely to tell us more. It is to the Christian 
Fathers we must turn for more esoteric knowledge, for they 
would be withheld by no scruple from revealing what they knew. 
But we cannot always believe that they knew much, for only 
those who, like Clement and Arnobius, had been Pagans in their 
youth, could ever have been initiated. Many of them uncriti- 
cally confuse in the same context and in one sweeping verdict 



of condemnation Orphic, Phrygian-Sabazian and Attis-Mysteries 
with the Eleusinian; and we ought not too lightly to infer that 
these were actually confused and blended at Eleusis, We must 
also be on our guard against supposing that when Pagan or 
Christian writers refer vaguely to " mysteria," they always have 
the Eleusinian in their mind. 

The questions that the critical analysis of all the evidence 
may hope to solve are mainly these: (a) What do we know or 
what can we infer concerning the personality of the deities to 
whom the Eleusinian mysteries were originally consecrated, 
and were new figures admitted at a later period ? (b) When was 
the mystery taken over by Athens and opened to all Hellas, and 
what was the state-organization provided? (c) What was the 
inner significance, essential content or purport of the Eleusinia, 
and what was the source of their great influence on Hellas? 
(d) Can we attribute any ethical value to them, and did they 
strongly impress the popular belief in immortality? Limits of 
space allow us only to adumbrate the results that research on 
the lines of these questions has hitherto yielded. 

The paramount divine personalities of the mystery were in 
the earliest period of which we have literary record, the mother 
and the daughter, Demeter and Kore, the latter being never 
styled Persephone in the official language of Eleusis; while the 
third figure, the god of the lower world known by the euphemistic 
names of Pluto (Plouton) and at one time Eubouleus, the ravisher 
and the husband, is an accessory personage, comparatively in 
the background. This is the conclusion naturally drawn from 
the Homeric hymn to Demeter, a composition of great ritualistic 
value, probably of the 7th century B.C., which describes the 
abduction of the daughter, the sorrow and search of the mother, 
her sitting by the sacred well, the drinking of the icvtceow or 
sacred cup and the legend of the pomegranate. An ancient 
hymn of Pamphos, from which Pausanias freely quotes and 
which he regards as genuine, 1 appears to have told much the 
same story in much the same way. As far as we can say, then, 
the mother and daughter were there in possession at the very 
beginning. The other pair of divinities known as 6 debs $ Sea, 
that appear in a 5th-century inscription and on two dedicatory 
reliefs found at Eleusis, have been supposed to descend from 
an aboriginal period of Eleusinian religion when deities were 
nameless, and when a peaceful pair of earth-divinities, male and 
female, were worshipped by the rustic community, before the 
earth-goddess had pluralized herself as Demeter and Kore, and 
before the story of the madre dolorosa and the lost daughter had 
arisen. 2 But for various reasons the contrary view is more 
probable, that 6 Bebs and rj Bed are later cult-titles of the 
married pair Pluto-Cora (PIouton-Kore), the personal names 
being omitted from that feeling of reverential shyness which was 
specially timid in regard to the sacred names of the deities of 
the underworld. And it is a fairly familiar phenomenon in Greek 
religion that two separate titles of the same divinity engender 
two distinct cults. 

The question as to the part played by Dionysus in the 
Eleusinia is important. Some scholars, like M. Foucart, have 
supposed that he belonged from the beginning to the inner 
circle of the mystery; others that he forced his way in at a 
somewhat later period owing to the great influence of the Orphic 
sects who captured the stronghold of Attic religion and engrafted 
the Orphic-Sabazian Upds X670S, the story of the incestuous 
union of Dionysus-Sabazius with Demeter-Kore, and of the 
death and rendering of Zagreus, upon the primitive Eleusinian 
faith. A saner and more careful criticism rejects this view. 
There is no genuine trace discovered as yet in the inner circle 
of the mysteries of any characteristically Orphic doctrine; the 
names of Zagreus and Phanes are nowhere heard, the legend of 
Zagreus and the death of Dionysus are not known to have 
been mentioned there. Nor is there any print within or in 
the precincts of the rekearfipiov: the hall of the liberal, of the 
footsteps of the Phrygian deities, Cybele, Attis, Sabazius.

MYSTERY 



nq 



The exact relation of Dionysus to the mysteries involves the 
question as to the divine personage called Iacchus; who and what 
was Iacchus? Strabo (p. 468), who is a poor authority on such 
matters, describes him as " the daemon of Demeter, the founder 
of the leader of the mysteries." More important is it to note 
that " Iacchus " is unknown to the author of the Homeric hymn, 
and that the first literary notice of him occurs in the well-known 
passage of Herodotus (viii. 65), who describes the procession of 
the mystae as moving along the sacred way from Athens to 
Eleusis and as raising the cry Ta«x e - We find Iacchus the 
theme of a glowing invocation in an Aristophanic Ode (Frogs, 
324-398), and described as a beautiful " young god "; but he is 
first explicitly identified with Dionysus in the beautiful ode of 
Sophocles' Antigone (n 19); and that this was in accord with the 
popular ritualistic lore is proved by the statement of the scholiast 
on Aristophanes (Frogs, 482) that the people at the Lenaea, the 
winter-festival of Dionysus, responded to the command of 
" Invoke the god! " with the invocation " Hail, Iacchus, son of 
Semele, thou giver of wealth! " We are sure, then, that in the 
high tide of the Attic religious history Iacchus was the youthful 
Dionysus, a name of the great god peculiar to Attic cult; and 
this is all that here concerns us to know. 

We can now answer the question raised above. This youthful 
Attic Dionysus has his home at Athens; he accompanies his 
votaries along the sacred way, filling their souls with the exalta- 
tion and ecstasy of the Dionysiac spirit; but at Eleusis he had no 
temple, altar or abiding home; he comes as a visitor and departs. 
His image may have been carried into the Hall of the Mysteries, 
but whether it played any part there in a passion-play we do 
not know. That he was a primary figure of the essential mystery 
is hard to believe, for we find no traces of his name in the 
other Greek communities that at an early period had insti- 
tuted mysteries on the Eleusinian model. Apart from Iacchus, 
Dionysus in his own name was powerful enough at Eleusis as in 
most other localities. And the votaries carried with them no 
doubt into the hall the Bacchic exaltation of the Iacchus proces- 
sion and the nightly revel with the god that preceded the full 
initiation; many of them also may have belonged to the private 
Dionysiac sects and might be tempted to read a Dionysiac signifi- 
cance into much that was presented to them. But all this is 
conjecture. The interpretation of what was shown would natur- 
ally change somewhat with the changing sentiment of the ages; 
but the mother and the daughter, the stately and beautiful 
figures presented to us by the author of the homeric hymn, who 
says no word of Dionysus, are still found reigning paramount 
and supreme at Eleusis just before the Gothic invasion in the 
latter days of Paganism. Triptolemus the apostle of corn- 
culture, Eubouleus — originally a euphemistic name of the god 
of the under- wo rid, " the giver of good counsel," conveying a 
hint of his oracular functions — these are accessory figures of 
Eleusinian cult and mythology that may have played some part 
in the great mystic drama that was enacted in the hall. 

The development and organization of the Eleusinia may now 
be briefly sketched. The legends concerning the initiation of 
Heracles and the Dioscuri preserve the record of the time when 
the mysteries were closed against all strangers, and were the 
privilege of the Eleusinians alone. Now the Homeric hymn in 
its obvious appeal to the whole of the Greek world to avail 
themselves of these mysteries gives us to suppose that they 
had already been thrown open to Hellas; and this momentous 
change, abolishing the old gentile barriers, may have naturally 
coincided with, or have resulted from, the fusion of Eleusis and 
Athens, an event of equal importance for politics and religion 
which we may place in the prehistoric period. The reign of 
Peisistratus was an era of architectural activity at Eleusis; 
but the construction of the fivariKos <rrjKos was one of the 
achievements of the Periclean administration. Two inscriptions, 
containing decrees passed during the supremacy of Pericles, the 
one proclaiming a holy truce of three months for the votaries 
that came from any Greek community, 1 the other bidding the 
subject allies and inviting the independent states to send 
1 Corp. inscr, alt. i. 1, 



airapxal or tithe-offerings of corn to Eleusis,' record the far- 
sighted policy of Periclean Athens, her determination to find a 
religious support for her hegemony. 

At least from the 5th century onwards, the external control 
and all questions of the organization of the mysteries were in 
the hands of the Athenian state, the rule holding in Attica as 
elsewhere in Hellas that the state was supreme over the Church. 
The head of the general management was the king-archon 
(archon-basileus) who with his paredros and the four " epimele- 
tai " formed a general committee of supervision, and matters of 
importance connected with the ritual were decided by the Boule 
or Eeelesia. But the claim of Eleusis as the religious metropolis 
was not ignored. The chief of the two priestly families, in whose 
hands lay the mystic celebration itself and the formal right of 
admission, was the Eleusinian "gens" of the Eumolpidae; it 
was to their ancestor that Demeter had entrusted her opryta, 
and the recognition of their claims maintained the principle 
of apostolic succession. To them belonged the hierophant 
(kpo4>avTTi$), the high priest of the Eleusinia, whose function 
alone it was to " reveal the orgies," to show the sacred things, 
and who alone — or perhaps with his consort -priestess — could 
penetrate into the innermost shrine in the hall; an impres- 
sive figure, so sacred in person that no one could address him 
by his personal name, and bound, at one period at least, by a 
rule of celibacy. We hear also of two " hierophantides," female 
attendants on the older and younger goddesses. In fact, while 
the male priest predominates in this ritual, the women play a 
prominent part: as we should expect, considering that the 
sister-festival of the Thesmophoria was wholly in their hands. 

The other old priestly family was that of the " Kerykes," 
to whom the oadovxos belonged, " the holder of the torch," 
the official second in rank to the i€po<f>avT7js. It is uncertain 
whether this family was of Eleusinian origin; and in the 4th 
century it seems to have died out, and the office of the dadovxos 
passed into the hands of the Lycomidae, a priestly family of 
Phlye, suspected of being devotees of Orphism. 

Turning now to the celebration itself, we can only sketch 
the more salient features here. On the 13th of Boedromion, 
the Attic month corresponding roughly to our September, 
the Ephebi (q.v.) marched out to Eleusis, and returned to Athens 
the next day bringing with them the " holy things " (Upa) to 
the " Eleusinion " in the city; these Upa probably included small 
images of the goddesses. The 16th was the day of the ay vp/xos, 
the gathering of the catechumens, when they met to hear the 
address of the hierophant, called the irpbppqais. This was 
no sermon, but a proclamation bidding those who were dis- 
qualified or for some reason unworthy of initiation to depart. 
The legally qualified were all Hellenes and subsequently all 
Romans above a certain — very youthful — limit of age, women, 
and as it appears even slaves; barbarians, and those uncleansed 
of some notorious guilt, such as homicide, were disqualified. We 
are sure that there was no dogmatic test, nor would time allow 
of any searching moral scrutiny, and only the Samothracian 
rites, in this respect unique in the world of classical religion, 
possessed a system of confessional. The hierophant appealed to 
the conscience of the multitude; but we are not altogether sure 
of the terms of his proclamation, which can only be approximately 
restored from late Pagan and early Christian writers. * We know 
that he demanded of each candidate that he should be " of 
intelligible speech (i.e. an Hellene) and pure of hand "; and he 
catechized him as to his condition of ritualistic purity — the food 
he had eaten or abstained from. It appears also from Libanius 
that in the later period at least he solemnly proclaimed that the 
catechumen should be "pure of soul," 3 and this spiritual 
conception of holiness had arisen already in the earlier periods 
of Greek religious thought. On the other hand we must bear in 
mind the criticism that Diogenes is said to have passed upon the 
Eleusinia, that many bad characters were admitted to com- 
munion^ thereby securing a promise of higher happiness than an 
uninitiated Epaminondas ^ould aspire to. 

An essential preliminary- was purification and lustration, and

MYSTERY 



after the assembly the " mystae " went to the sea-shore (akade 
juu(TTat) and purified themselves with sea-water, and probably 
with sprinkling of pigs' blood, a common cathartic medium. 
After their return from the sea, a sacrifice of some kind was 
offered as an essential condition of /u^ais, but whether as a 
sacrament or a gift-offering to the goddesses it is impossible to 
determine. On the 19th of Boedromion'the great procession 
started along the sacred way bearing the " fair young god " 
Iacchus; and as they visited many shrines by the way the march 
must have continued long after sunset, so that the 20th is some- 
times spoken of as the day of the exodus of Iacchus. On the 
way each wore a saffron band as an amulet; and the ceremonious 
reviling to which the " mystai " were subjected as they crossed 
the bridge of the Cephissus answered the same purpose of 
averting the evil eye. Upon the arrival at Eleusis, on the same 
night or on the following, they celebrated a midnight revel 
under the stars with Iacchus, which Aristophanes glowingly 
describes. 

The question of supreme interest now arises: What was the 
mystic ceremony in the hall? what was said and what was done? 
We can distinguish two grades in the celebration; the greater 
was the r£Xea and €7ro7rrt/cd, the full and satisfying celebration, 
to which only those were admitted who had passed the lesser 
stage at least a year before. As regards the actual ritual in the 
hall of the mystae, much remains uncertain in spite of the 
unwearying efforts of many generations of scholars to construct 
a reasonable statement out of fragments of often doubtful 
evidence. We are certain at least that something was acted there 
in a religious drama or passion-play, the revelation was partly 
a pageant of holy figures; the accusations against Aeschylus 
and Alcibiades would suffice to prove this; and Porphyry speaks 
of the hierophant and the dydouxos acting divine parts. 
What the subject of this drama was may be gathered partly 
from the words of Clement — " Deo (Demeter) and Kore became 
the personages of a mystic drama, and Eleusis with its 8q£ovxo$ 
celebrates the wandering, the abduction and the sorrow ■" 
(Protrept.y p. 12 Potter), partly from Psyche's appeal to Demeter 
in Apuleius (Metamorph. 6) — " by the unspoken secrets of the 
mystic chests, the winged chariots of thy dragon-ministers, the 
bridal descent of Proserpine [Persephone], the torch-lit wander- 
ings to find thy daughter and all the other mysteries that the 
shrine of Attic Eleusis shrouds in secret." We may believe then 
that the great myth of the mother's sorrow, the loss and the 
partial recovery of her beloved was part of the Eleusinian 
passion-play. Did it also include a tepos yafios? We should 
naturally expect that the sacred story acted in the mystic 
pageant would close with the scene of reconciliation, such as a 
holy marriage of the god and the goddess. But the evidence 
that this was so is mainly indirect, apart from a doubtful passage 
in Asterius, a writer of questionable authority in the 4th century 
a.d. (Econotn. martyr, p. 194, Combe). At any rate, if a holy 
marriage formed part of the passion-play, it may well have been 
acted with solemnity and delicacy. We have no reason to 
believe that even to a modern taste any part of the ritual would 
appear coarse or obscene; even Clement, who brings a vague 
charge of obscenity against all mysteries in general, does not 
try to substantiate it in regard to the Eleusinia, and we hear 
from another Christian writer of the scrupulous purity of the 
hierophant. 

It would be interesting to know if the birth of a holy child, 
a babe Iacchus, for example, was a motive of the mystic drama. 
The question seems at first sight to be decided by a definite 
statement of Hippolytus (Philosoph. 5, 8), that at a certain 
moment in the mysteries the hierophant cried aloud: " The lady- 
goddess Brimo has borne Brimos the holy child." But a careful 
consideration of the context almost destroys the value of his 
* authority. For he does not pretend to be a first-hand witness, 
but admits that he is drawing from Gnostic sources, and he goes 
on at once to speak of Attis and his self-mutilation. The formula 
may then refer to the Sabazian-Phrygian mystery, which the 
Gnostics with their usual spirit of religious syncretism would 
have no scruple in identifying with the Eleusinian. And the 



archaeological evidence that has been supposed to support the 
statement of Hippolytus is deceptive. 

Finally, we must not suppose that there could be any very 
elaborate scenic arrangements in the hall for the representation 
of Paradise and the Inferno, whereby the rewards of the faithful 
and the punishments of the damned might be impressively 
brought home to the. mystae. The excavations on the site have 
proved that the building was without substructures or under- 
ground passages. A large number of inscriptions present us 
with elaborate accounts of Eleusinian expenditure; but there is 
no item for scenic expenses or painting. We are led to suppose 
that the pageant-play produced its effect by means of gorgeous 
raiment, torches and stately figures. 

But the mystic action included more than the pageant-play. 
The hierophant revealed certain holy objects to the eyes of the 
assembly. There is reason to suppose that these included cer- 
tain primitive idols of the goddesses of immemorial sanctity; 
and, if we accept a statement of Hippolytus (loc. cit.) we must 
believe that the epoptae were also shown " that great and marvel- 
lous mystery of perfect revelation, a cut corn-stalk." The value 
of this definite assertion, which appears to be an explicit revela- 
tion of the secret, would be very great, if we could trust it; but 
unfortunately it occurs in the same suspicious context as the 
Brimo-Brimos formula, and we again suspect the same uncritical 
confusion of Eleusinian with Phrygian ritual, for we know that 
Attis himself was identified in his mysteries with the " reaped 
corn," the ct&x 1 * cL/it/tos, almost the very phrase used by 
Hippolytus. Only, it is in the highest degree probable, whether 
Hippolytus knew anything or not, that a corn-token was shown 
among the sacred things of a mystery which possessed an original 
agrarian significance and was intended partly to consecrate and 
to foster the agricultural life. But to say this is by no means the 
same as to admit the view of Lenormant 1 and Dr Jevons 2 that 
the Eleusinians worshipped the actual corn, or revered it as a 
clan-totem. For of direct corn- worship or of corn-to temism 
there is no trace either at Eleusis or elsewhere in Greece. 

Among the dp&fieva or " things done " may we also include 
a solemn sacrament, the celebration of a holy communion, in 
which the votary was united to the divinity by partaking of 
some holy food or drink? We owe to Clement of Alexandria 
(Protrept. p. 18, Potter) an exact transcription of the pass-word 
of the Eleusinian mystae; it ran as follows (if we accept 
Lobeck's emendation cf hyyevaafievos for kpyaaaiievos) : "I 
have fasted, I have drunk the barley-drink, I have taken [the 
things] from the sacred chest, having tasted thereof I have placed 
them into the basket and again from the basket into the chest." 
We gather from this that some kind of sacrament was at least a 
preliminary condition of initiation; the mystae drank of the same 
cup as the goddess drank in her sorrow, partly — as we say — " in 
memory of her," partly to unite themselves more closely with 
her. We know also from an inscription that the priest of the 
Samothracian mysteries broke sacred bread and poured out drink 
for the mystae (Arch, epigr. Mitth. 1882, p. 8, No. 14). But 
neither in these nor in the Eleusinian is there any trace of the 
more mystic sacramental conception, any indication that the 
votaries believed themselves to be partaking of the actual body 
of their divinity; 3 for there is no evidence that Demeter was 
identified with the corn, still less with the barley-meal of which 
the kvk€&v was compounded. Nor is it likely that the sacra- 
ment was the pivot of the whole mystery or was part of the 
essential act of the nbqais itself. In the first place we have 
an almost certain representation of the Eleusinian sacrament on 
an archaic vase in Naples, 4 probably of Attic provenance^ and 
the artistic reproduction of a holy act would have been impious 
and dangerous, if this had belonged to the inner circle of the 
mystery. Again, there is no mention of sacrament or sacrifice 
among the five essential parts of juwyats given by Theo

Smyrnaeus, nor in the imaginary narrative of the late rhetorician 
Sopatros, 1 who supposes the strange case of a man being initiated 
by the goddesses in a dream: they admit him to their full 
communion merely by telling him something and showing him 
something. 

Besides the 5p6)jxeva, then, there were also certain things 
said in the hall, or in the earlier stages of initiation, which we 
would gladly discover. Part of these were mystic formulae, 
one of which has been discussed already, the pass-word of 
the votaries. We gather also from Proclus and Hippolytus 2 
that in the Eleusinian rites they gazed up to heaven and 
cried aloud " rain " — ve — and gazed down upon the earth and 
cried " conceive " — Kve. This ritual charm — we cannot call it 
prayer — descends from the old agrarian magic which underlay 
the primitive mystery. What else the votaries may have uttered, 
whether by way of thanksgiving or solemn litany, we do not 
know. 3 But there was also a certain Upds Myos, some exposi- 
tion accompanying the unfolding of the mysteries; for it was part 
of the prestige of the hierophant that he was chief spokesman, 
" who poured forth winning utterance and whose voice the 
catechumen ardently desired to hear " (Anth. Pal. y app. 246) ; and 
Galen speaks of the rapt attention paid by the initiated " to the 
things done and said in the Eleusinian and Samothracian 
mysteries " (De usu part. 7. 14). But we have no trustworthy 
evidence as to the real content of the X670S of the hierophant. 
We need not believe that the whole of his discourse was taken 
up with corn-symbolism, as Varro seems to imply (Aug. De civil. 
Dei. 20), or that he taught natural philosophy rather than 
theology, or again, the special doctrine of Euhemems, as two 
passages in Cicero (De natur. deor. i. 42; Tusc. i. 13) might 
prompt us to suppose. His chief theme was probably an expo- 
' sition of the meaning and value of the tepd, as in an Australian 
initiation rite it is the privilege of the elders to explain the 
nature of the " churinga " to the youths. And his discourse 
on these may have been coloured to some extent by the theories 
current in the philosophic speculation of the day. But though 
in the time of Julian he appears to have been a philosopher of 
Neo-platonic tendencies, we ought not to suppose that the 
hierophant as a rule would be able or inclined to rise above the 
anthropomorphic religion of the times. Whatever symbolism 
attached to the Upa, the sacred objects shown, was probably 
simple and natural; for instance, in the Eleusinian, as in Egyptian 
eschatology, the token of the growing corn may have served as 
an emblem — though not a proof — of man's resurrection. The 
doctrine of the continuance of the soul after death was already 
accepted by the popular belief, and the hierophant had no need 
to preach it as a dogma; the votaries came to Eleusis to ensure 
themselves a happy immortality. And in our earliest record, 
the Homeric hymn, we find that the mysteries already hold out 
this higher promise. How, we may ask, were the votaries 
assured? M. Foucart in Les grands mysteres d* Eleusis has 
maintained that the object of the mysteries was much the same 
as that of the Egyptian Book of the Dead; to provide the mystae 
with elaborate rules for avoiding the dangers that beset the road 
to the other world, and for attaining at last to the happy regions; 
that for this purpose the hierophant recited magic formulae 
whereby the soul could repel the demons that it might encounter 
on the path; and that it was to seek this deliverance from the 
terrors of hell that all Greece flocked to Eleusis. This is in 
accord with his whole " egyptizing " theory concerning the 
Eleusmia, a theory which, though Egyptian influence cannot 
a priori be ruled out, is not found in harmony with the facts 
of the two religious systems. And the particular hypothesis 
just stated is altogether wanting in direct evidence, or — we 
may say — in vraisemblance. There is no hint or allusion to

* The other formula which the scholiast on Plato (Gorg. -197 c.) 
assigns to the Eleusinian rite: " I have eaten from the timbrel, I 
have drunk from the cymbal, I have carried the sacred vessel, 
I have crept under the bridal-chamber ) ,, belongs, not to Eleusis, 
but, as Clement and Firmicus Maternus themselves attest, to Phrygia 
and to Attis. 



be found in the ancient sources suggesting that the recital of 
magic formulae was part of the ceremony. The Myos, what- 
ever it was, was comparatively unimportant. And the Greek 
public in general, in its vigorous period when the Eleusinian 
religion reached its zenith, was not tormented, as modern 
Europe has at times been, by ghostly terrors of judgment. 

The assurance of the hope of the Eleusinian votary was 
obtained by the feeling of friendship and mystic sympathy, 
established by mystic contact, with the mother and the daughter, 
the powers of life after death. Those who won their friendship 
by initiation in this life would by the simple logic of faith 
regard themselves as certain to win blessing at their hands in 
the next. 

It is obvious that the mysteries made no direct appeal to 
the intellect, nor on the other hand revolted it by any oppressive 
dogmatism. As regards their psychic effect, we have Aristotle's 
invaluable judgment: " The initiated do not learn anything so 
much as feel certain emotions and are put into a certain frame 
of mind " (Synes. Dion. p. 48a). The appeal was to the eye 
and to the imagination through a form of religious mesmerism 
working by means that were solemn, stately and beautiful. 
To understand the quality and the intensity of the impression 
produced, we should borrow something from the modern experi- 
ences of Christian communion-service, mass, and passion-play, 
and bear in mind also the extraordinary susceptibility of the 
Greek mind to an artistically impressive pageant. 

That the Eleusinia preached a higher morality than that 
of the current Standard is not proved. That they exercised 
a direct and elevating influence on the individual character is 
nowhere explicitly maintained, as Diodorus (v. 49) maintains 
concerning the Samothracian. But on general grounds it is 
reasonable to believe that such powerful religious experience 
as they afforded would produce moral fruit in many minds. The 
genial Aristophanes (Frogs, 455) intimates as much, and 
Andocides (De tnyster. p. 36, § 31; p. 44, § 125) assumes that 
those who had been initiated would take a juster and sterner 
view of moral innocence and guilt, and that foul conduct was 
a greater sin when committed by a man who was in the official 
service of the mother and the daughter. 

Besides the greater mysteries at Eleusis, we hear of the 
lesser mysteries of Agrae on the banks of the Ilissos. Estab- 
lished, perhaps, originally by Athens herself at a time when 
Eleusis was independent and closed her rites to strangers, 
they became wholly subordinated to the greater, and were put 
under the same management and served merely as a necessary 
preliminary to the higher initiation into them. Sacrifice was 
offered to the same great goddesses at both; but we have the 
authority of Duris (Athenae, 253J), the Samian historian, and 
the evidence of an Attic painting, called the pinax of Nannion, 4 
that the predominant goddess in the mysteries at Agrae was 
Kore. And this agrees with the time of their celebration, in 
the middle of Anthesterion, when Kore was supposed to return 
in the young corn. Stephanus (s.v. "Aypa), drawing from an 
unknown source, declares that the Dionysiac story was the 
theme of their mystic drama. Hence theorists have supposed 
that their content was wholly Orphic or that their central 
motive was the marriage of Dionysus and Kore. The theory 
has no archaeological or literary support except the passage in 
Stephanus, nor have we reason for believing that the marriage 
of these two divinities was recognized in Attic state ritual. 

The influence of Eleusis in early times must have been 
great, for we find offshoots of its cult, whether mystic or not, 
in other parts of Greece. In Boeotia, Laconia, Arcadia, Crete 
and Thera, Demeter brought with her the title of "Eleusinia"; 
and no other explanation is so probable as the obvious one 
that this name designates " the goddess of Eleusis," and though 
there may have been other places called " Eleusis," the only 
famous religious centre was the Attic. The initiation rites of 
Demeter at Celeae near Phlius, at Lerna in Argolis, and at 
Naples, were organized after the pattern of the Eleusinian. But 
of these and the other Demeter mysteries in the Greek world,

MYSTERY 



there is little to record that is certain and at the same time of 
primary importance for the history of religion. The Arcadian 
city of Pheneus possessed a mystery that boasted an Eleusinian 
character and origin, yet in the record of it there is no mention 
of Kore, and we may suspect that, like other Demeter-worships 
in the Peloponnese, it belonged to a period when the earth- 
goddess was revered as a single personality and Kore had not 
yet emanated from her. We know much more of the details 
of the great Andanian mysteries in Messenia, owing to the 
discovery of the important and much-discussed Andanian in- 
scription of 91 B.C. 1 But what we know are facts of secondary 
importance only. We gather from Pausanias (4. 33. 4; cf. 4- *• 
5. and 4. 26. 8; 4. 27. 6) that the rites, which he regards as secend 
in solemnity and prestige to the Eleusinian alone, were conse- 
crated to the MeyaXa: Seal, . . . the great goddesses, . . . and that 
Kore enjoyed the mystic title of Hagne, " the holy one." 
The inscription has been supposed to correct and to refute 
Pausanias, but it does not really controvert his statements, 
which are attested by other evidence; it proves only that other 
divinities came at a later time to have a share in the mysteries, 
such astheMeydXot OeoL who were probably the Cabeiri (q.v.). It 
is clear that the Andanian mysteries included a sacred drama, 
in which women personated the goddesses. The priestesses were 
married women, and were required to take an oath that they 
had lived " in relation to their husbands a just and holy life." 
We hear also of grades of initiation, purification-ceremonies, 
but of no sacrament or eschatologic promise; yet it is probable 
that these mysteries, like the Eleusinian, maintained and 
secured the hope of future happiness. 

The Eleusinian faith is not wholly unattested by the grave- 
inscriptions of Hellas, though it speaks but rarely on these. 
The most interesting example is the epitaph of a hierophant 
who proclaims that he has found that " death was not an evil, 
but a blessing." 2 

Of equal importance for the private religion of Greece were 
the Orphic mystic societies, bearing a Thraco-Phrygian tradition 
into Greece, and associated originally with the name of Dionysus, 
and afterwards with Sabazius also and the later cult-ideas of 
Phrygia. 3 The full account of the Dionysiac mysteries would 
demand a critical study of the Dionysiac religion as a whole, 
as well as of the private sects that sprang up under its shadow. 
It is only possible here to indicate the salient characteristics of 
those which are of primary value for the history of religion. 

Originally a great nature-god of the Thraco-Phrygian stock, 
powerful over all vegetation and especially revealing his power 
in the vine, Dionysus was forcing his way into Greece at least 
as early as the Homeric period, and by the 6th century was 
received into the public cults of most of the Greek communities. 
We can gather with some certainty or probability his aboriginal 
characteristics and the form of his worship. Being a god of 
the life of the earth, he was also a nether divinity, the lord of 
the world of souls, with whom the dead votary entered into 
privileged communion; his rites were mystic, and nightly 
celebrations were frequent, marked by wild ecstasy and orgiastic 
self-abandonment, in which the votary became at one with 
the divinity and temporarily possessed his powers; women 
played a prominent part in the ritual; a savage form of sacra- 
mental communion was in vogue, and the animal victim of 
whose flesh and blood the votaries partook was at times re- 
garded as tbe incarnation of the divinity, so that the god himself 
might be supposed to die and to rise again; finally we may 
regard certain cathartic ideas as part of the primeval tradition

of this religion. Admitted among the soberer cults of the 
Greek communities, it lost most of its wildness and savagery, 
while still retaining a more emotional ecstatic character than 
the rest. But this cooling process was arrested by a new 
wave of Dionysiac fervour that spread over Greece from the 
7th century onwards, bringing with it the name of Orpheus, 4 
and engendering at some later date the Orphic brotherhoods 
(thiasi). This religious movement may have started like 
the earlier one from the lands north of Greece; but Crete and 
even Egypt are supposed to have contributed much to the 
Orphic doctrine and ritual. Our earliest authority for the 
proceedings of the mystery-practitioner who used the name 
of Orpheus is the well-known passage in Plato's Republic 
(p. 364a), in which he speaks contemptuously of the itinerant 
ritualists who knock at the doors of the rich, the vendors of 
magic incantations, who promise absolution from sins and 
happiness in the next world to be attained by a ritual of puri- 
fication and mystic initiation. This record brings to our notice 
a phenomenon unknown elsewhere in Greek religion ; the 
missionary spirit, the impulse to preach to all who would hear, 
which foreshadows the breaking down of the gentile religious 
barriers of the ancient world. And it is probable that some 
kind of " Orphic " propagandism, whether through books or 
itinerant mystery-priests, or both, had been in vogue some time 
before Plato. We may fairly conjecture that it has to some 
extent inspired the glowing eschatology of Pindar, who describes 
the next world as a*place of penance and purgation from ancestral 
or personal taint and of final reward for the purified soul, and 
who unites this belief with a doctrine of reincarnation. In 
the Hippolytus of Euripides, Theseus taunts his son with 
cloaking his immorality under hypocritical " Orphic " preten- 
sions to purity, the pharisaic affectation, for instance, of a 
vegetarian diet (952-954). Still more important is the fragment 
of the Cretans of Euripides, attesting the strength of the 
antiquity of these mystic Dionysiac associations in Crete. 
The initiated votary proclaims himself as sanctified to Zeus of 
Ida, to Zagreus — the Orphic name of the nether-world Dionysus 
— and to the mountain-goddess Rhea-Cybele; he has fulfilled 
" the solemn rite of the banquet of raw flesh," and henceforth 
he " robes himself in pure white and avoids the taint of child- 
birth and funerals and abstains from meat." And — what is 
most significant — he calls himself by the very name of his god — 
he is himself Bclkxos. In spirit and in most of its details 
the passage accords well with the Bacchae of Euripides, which 
reflects not so much the public worship of Greece, but rather 
the mystic Dionysiac brotherhoods. Throughout this inspired 
drama the votary rejoices to be one with his divinity and to 
call himself by his name, and this mystic union is brought 
about partly, though Euripides may not have known it, through 
" the meal of raw flesh " or the drinking of the blood of the 
goat or the kid or the bull. The sacramental intention of this 
is confirmed by abundant proof; even in the state-cult of 
Tenedos they dressed up a bull-calf as Dionysus and reveren- 
tially sacrificed it (Ael. Nat. an. 12. 34); those who partook of 
the flesh were partaking of what was temporarily the body of 
their god. The Christian fathers at once express their abhorrence 
of this savage wfio<t>ayia and reveal its true significance 
(Arnob. Adv. nat. 5. 119); and Firmicus Maternus (De error., 
p. 84) attests that the Cretans of his own day celebrated a funeral 
festival in honour of Dionysus in which they enacted the life and 
the death of the god in a passion-play and " rent a living bull 
with their teeth." 

But the most speaking record of the aspirations and ideas 
of the Orphic mystic is preserved in the famous gold tablets 
found in tombs near Sybaris, one near Rome, and one in Crete. 
These have been frequently published and discussed; and here 
it is only possible to allude to the salient features that concern 
the general history of religion. They contain fragments of a 
sacred hymn that must have been in vogue at least as early 
as the 3rd century B.C., and which was inscribed in order to

be buried with the defunct, as an amulet that might protect 
him from the dangers of his journey through the under-world 
and open to him the gates of Paradise. The verses have the 
power of an incantation. The initiated soul proclaims its divine 
descent: " I am the son of Earth and Heaven ": "I am perishing 
with thirst, give me to drink of the waters of memory ": " I come 
from the pure ": " I have paid the penalty of unrighteousness ": 
" I have flown out of the weary, sorrowful circle of life." His 
'reward is assured him: " O blessed and happy one, thou hast 
put off thy mortality and shalt become divine." The strange 
formula lpi<t>o$ h yak' hcerov, "la kid fell into the milk," 
has been interpreted by Dieterich (Eine Mithras — Liturgie, 
p. 174) with great probability as alluding to a conception of 
Dionysus himself as €pi<£tos, the divine kid, and to a ritual 
of milk-baptism in which the initiated was born again. 

We discern, then, in these mystic brotherhoods the germs of 
a high religion and the prevalence of conceptions that have 
played a great part in the religious history of Europe. And 
as late as the days of Plutarch they retained their power of 
consoling the afflicted (ConsoL ad uxor., c. 10). 

The Phrygian-Sabazian mysteries, associated with Attis, 
Cybele and Sabazius, which invaded later Greece and early 
imperial Rome, were originally akin to these and contained 
many concepts in common with them. But their orgiastic 
ecstasy was more violent, and the psychical aberrations to 
which the votaries were prone through their passionate desire 
for divine communion were more dangerous. Emasculation 
was practised by the devotees, probably in order to assimilate 
themselves as far as possible to their goddess by abolishing the 
distinction of sex, and the high-priest himself bore the god's 
name. Or communion with the deity might be attained by the 
priest through the bath of blood in the taurobolion (q.v.) 7 or 
by the gashing of the arm over the altar. A more questionable 
method which lent itself to obvious abuses, or at least to the 
imputation of indecency, was the simulation of a sacred 
marriage, in which the catechumen was corporeally united 
with the great goddess in her bridal chamber (Dieterich, op. 
cit. pp. 1 21-134). Prominent also in these Phrygian mysteries 
were the conception of rebirth and the belief, vividly impressed 
by solemn pageant and religious drama, in the death and resur- 
rection of the beloved Attis. The Hilaria in which these 
were represented fell about the time of our Easter; and Firmicus 
Maternus reluctantly confesses its resemblance to the Christian 
celebration. 1 

The Eleusinian mysteries are far more characteristic of the 
older Hellenic mind. These later rites breathe an Oriental 
spirit, and though their forms appear strange and distorted 
they have more in common with the subsequent religious 
phenomena of Christendom. And the Orphic doctrine may 
have even contributed something to the later European ideals 
of private and personal morality. 2

MYSTICISM (from Gt. fibeiv, to shut the eyes; fxvvTtis, one 
initiated into the mysteries), a phase of thought, or rather 
perhaps of feeling, which from its very nature is hardly suscep- 
tible of exact definition. It appears in connexion with the 
endeavour of the human mind to grasp the divine essence or 
the ultimate reality of things, and to enjoy the blessedness of 
actual communion with the Highest. The first is the philosophic 
side of mysticism; the second, its religious side. The first effort 
is theoretical or speculative; the second, practical. The 
thought that is most intensely present with the mystic is that

of a supreme, all-pervading, and indwelling power, in whom 
all things are one. Hence the speculative utterances of 
mysticism are always more or less pantheistic in character. On 
the practical side, mysticism maintains the possibility of direct in- 
tercourse with this Being of beings — intercourse, not through any 
external media such as an historical revelation, oracles, answers 
to prayer, and the like, but by a species of ecstatic transfusion 
or identification, in which the individual becomes in very truth 
" partaker of the divine nature." God ceases to be an object 
to him and becomes an experience. In the writings of the 
mystics, ingenuity exhausts itself in the invention of phrases 
to express the closeness of this union. Mysticism differs, there- 
fore, from ordinary pantheism in that its inmost motive is 
religious; but, whereas religion is ordinarily occupied with a 
practical problem and develops its theory in an ethical refer- 
ence, mysticism displays a predominatingly speculative bent, 
starting from the divine nature rather than from man and his 
surroundings, taking the symbolism of religious feeling as 
literally or metaphysically true, and straining after the present 
realization of an ineffable union. The union which sound 
religious teaching represents as realized in the submission of 
the will and the ethical harmony of the whole life is then reduced 
to a passive experience, to something which comes and goes 
in time, and which may be of only momentary duration. 
Mysticism, it will be seen, is not a name applicable to any 
particular system. It may be the outgrowth of many differing 
modes of thought and feeling. Most frequently it appears 
historically, in relation to some definite system of belief, as a 
reaction of the spirit against the letter. When a religion begins 
to ossify into a system of formulas and observances, those who 
protest in the name of heart-religion are not unfrequently 
known by the name of mystics. At times they merely bring 
into prominence again the ever-fresh fact of personal religious 
experience; at other times mysticism develops itself as a 
powerful solvent of definite dogmas. 

A review of the historical appearances of mysticism will serve 
to show how far the above characteristics are to be found, 
separately or in combination, in its different phases. 

In the East, mysticism is not so much a specific phenomenon 
as a natural deduction from the dominant philosophic systems, 
and the normal expression of religious feeling in the 
lands in which it appears. Brahmanic pantheism systems. 
and Buddhistic nihilism alike teach the unreality of 
the seeming world, and preach mystical absorption as the 
highest goal; in both, the sense of the worth of human person- 
ality is lost. India consequently has always been the fertile 
mother of practical mystics and devotees. The climate itself 
encourages to passivity, and the very luxuriance of vegetable 
and animal life tends to blunt the feeling of the value of life. 
Silent contemplation and the total deadening of consciousness 
by perseverance for years in unnatural attitudes are among the 
commonest forms assumed by this mystical asceticism. But 
the most revolting methods of self-torture and self-destruction 
are also practised as a means of rising in sanctity. The 
sense of sin can hardly be said to enter into these exercises — that 
is, they are not undertaken as penance for personal transgression. 
They are a despite done to the principle of individual or separate 
existence. 

The so-called mysticism of the Persian Sufis is less intense and 
practical, more airy and literary in character. Sufism (q.v.) 
appears in the 9th century among the Mahommedans of Persia 
as a kind of reaction against the rigid monotheism and formalism 
of Islam. It is doubtless to be regarded as a revival of ancient 
habits of thought and feeling among a people who had adopted 
the Koran, not by affinity, but by compulsion. Persian literature 
after that date, and especially Persian poetry, is full of an ardent 
natural pantheism, in which a mystic apprehension of the unity 
and divinity of all things heightens the delight in natural and 
in human beauty. Such is the poetry of Hafiz and Saadi, 
whose verses are chiefly devoted to the praises of wine and 
women. Even the most licentious of these have been fitted 
by Mahommedan theologians with a mystical interpretation.

MYSTICISM 



The delights of love are made to stand for the raptures of union 
with the divine, the tavern symbolizes an oratory, and intoxica- 
tion is the bewilderment of sense before the surpassing vision. 
Very often, if not most frequently, it cannot be doubted that 
the occult religious significance depends on an artificial 
exegesis; but there are also poems of Hafiz, Saadi, and other 
writers, religious in their first intentions. These are unequivo- 
cally pantheistic in tone, and the desire of the soul to escape 
and rest with God is expressed with all the fervour 'of Eastern 
poetry. This speculative mood, in which nature and beauty 
and earthly satisfaction appear as a vain show, is the counterpart 
of the former mood of sensuous enjoyment. 

For opposite reasons, neither the Greek nor the Jewish mind 
lent itself readily to mysticism: the Greek, because of its clear and 
sunny naturalism; the Jewish, because of its rigid monotheism 
and its turn towards worldly realism and statutory observance. 
It is only with the exhaustion of Greek and Jewish civilization 
that mysticism becomes a prominent factor in Western thought. 
It appears, therefore, contemporaneously with Christianity, 
and is a sign of the world- weariness and deep religious need 
that mark the decay of the old world. Whereas Plato's main 
problem had been the organization of the perfect state, and 
Aristotle's intellect had ranged with fresh interest over all 
departments of the knowable, political speculation had become 
a mockery with the extinction of free political life, and know- 
ledge as such had lost its freshness for the Greeks of the Roman 
Empire. Knowledge is nothing to these men if it does not 
show them the infinite reality which is able to fill the aching 
void within. Accordingly, the last age of Greek philosophy 
is theosophical in character, and its ultimate end is a practical 
satisfaction. Neoplatonism seeks this in the ecstatic intuition 
of the ineffable One. The systematic theosophy of Plotinus 
and his successors does not belong to the present article, except 
so far as it is the presupposition of their mysticism; but, inas- 
much as the mysticism of the medieval Church is directly 
derived from Neoplatonism through the speculations of the 
pseudo-Dionysius, Neoplatonic mysticism fills an important 
section in any historical review of the subject. 

Neoplatonism owes its form to Plato, but its underlying 
motive is the widespread feeling of self-despair and the longing 
for divine illumination characteristic of the age 
piatoaism. * n wn i cn it appears. Before the rise of Neoplaton- 
ism proper we meet with various mystical or semi- 
mystical expressions of the same religious craving. The 
contemplative asceticism of the Essenes of Judaea may be 
mentioned, and, somewhat later, the life of the Therapeutae 
on the shores of Lake Moeris. In Philo, Alexandrian Judaism 
had already seized upon Plato as " the Attic Moses," and done 
its best to combine his speculations with the teaching of his 
Jewish prototype. Philo's God is described in terms of absolute 
transcendency; his doctrine of the Logos or Divine Sophia is a 
theistical transformation of the Platonic world of ideas; his 
allegorical interpretation of the Old Testament represents 
the spiritualistic dissolution of historical Judaism. Philo's 
ethical ideal is renunciation, contemplation, complete surrender 
to the divine influence. Apollonius of Tyana and the so-called 
Neopythagoreans drew similar ethical consequences from 
their eclectic study of Plato. Wonder-workers like Alexander 
the Paphlagonian exhibit the grosser side of the longing for 
spiritual communion. The traits common to Neoplatonism 
and all these speculations are well summed up by Zeller {Philos. 
der Griecken, Hi. 2. 214) as consisting in: " (1) the dualistic 
opposition of the divine and the earthly; (2) an abstract con- 
ception of God, excluding all knowledge of the divine nature; 
(3) contempt for the world of the senses, on the ground of the 
Platonic doctrines of matter and of the descent of the soul from 
,a superior world into the body; (4) the theory of intermediate 
potencies or beings, through whom God acts upon the world 
of phenomena; (5) the requirement of an ascetic self -emancipa- 
tion from the bondage of sense and faith in a higher revelation 
to man when in a state called enthusiasm." Neoplatonism 
appears in the first half of the 3rd century, and has its 



greatest representative in Plotinus. He develops the Platonic 
philosophy into an elaborate system by means of the doctrine 
of emanation. The One, the Good, and the Idea of the Good 
were identical in Plato's mind, and the Good was therefore not 
deprived of intelligible essence. It was not separated from 
the world of ideas, of which it was represented as either the 
crown or the sum. By Plotinus, on the contrary, the One is 
explicitly exalted above the vovs and the "ideas"; it trans- 
cends existence altogether (hrkicuva ttjs ovvias), and is not* 
cognizable by reason. Remaining itself in repose, it rays out, 
as it were, from its own fullness an image of itself, which is 
called vovs, and which constitutes the system of ideas of the 
intelligible world. The soul is in turn the image or product of 
the vovs y and the soul by its motion begets corporeal matter. 
The soul thus faces two ways — towards the vovs 7 from which 
it springs, and towards the material life, which is its own 
pioduet. Ethical endeavour consists in the repudiation of 
the sensible; material existence is itself estrangement from 
God. (Porphyry tells us that Plotinus was unwilling to name 
his parents or his birthplace, and .seemed ashamed of being 
in the body.) Beyond the KaBLpatts, or virtues which purify 
from sin, lies the further stage of complete identification with 
God (ovk e%a> ajxaprias eiVai; dXXa Oeov elvat). To reach the 
ultimate goal, thought itself must be left behind; for thought 
is a form of motion, and the desire of the soul is for the motion- 
less rest which belongs to the One. The union with transcendent 
deity is not so much knowledge or vision as ecstasy, coalescence, 
contact {tKGTaais cbrXaxns, a<j>rj } Ennead., vi. 9. 8-9). But in 
our present state of existence the moments of this ecstatic union 
must be few and short; " I myself," says Plotinus simply, 
" have realized it but three times as yet, and Porphyry hitherto 
not once." 

It will be seen from the above that Neoplatonism is not 
mystical as regards the faculty by which it claims to apprehend 
philosophic truth. It is first of all a system of complete 
rationalism; it is assumed, in other words, that reason is capable 
of mapping out the whole system of things. But, inasmuch as 
a God is affirmed beyond reason, the mysticism becomes in a 
sense the necessary complement of the would-be all-embracing 
rationalism. The system culminates in a- mystical act, and 
in the sequel, especially with Iamblichus and the Syrian 
Neoplatonists, mystical practice ' tended more and more to 
overshadow the theoretical groundwork. 

It was probably about the end of the 5th century, just as 
ancient philosophy was dying out in the schools of Athens, 
that the speculative mysticism of Neoplatonism made a 
definite lodgment in Christian thought through the literary 
forgeries of the pseudo-Dionysius (see Dionysius the Areopa- 
gite). The doctrines of Christianity were by that time so firmly 
established that the Church could look upon a symbolical or 
mystical interpretation of them without anxiety. The author 
of the Theologia mystica and the other works ascribed to the 
Areopagite proceeds, therefore, to develop the doctrines of 
Proclus with very little modification into a system of esoteric 
Christianity. God is the nameless and supra-essential One, 
elevated above goodness itself. Hence " negative theology," 
which ascends from the creature to God by dropping one after 
another every determinate predicate, leads us nearest to the 
truth. The return to God (Ivwais, Stoats) is the consummation 
of all things and the goal indicated by Christian teaching. The 
same doctrines were preached with more of churchly fervour 
by Maximus the Confessor (580-622). St Maximus represents 
almost the last speculative activity of the Greek Church, but 
the influence of the pseudo-Dionysian writings were transmitted 
to the West in the 9th century by Erigena, in whose speculative' 
spirit both the scholasticism and the mysticism of the middle 
ages have their rise. Erigena translated Dionysius into Latin 
along with the commentaries of Maximus, and his system is 
essentially based upon theirs. The negative theology is adopted, 
and God is stated to be predicateless Being, above all categories, 
and therefore not improperly called Nothing. Out of this 
Nothing or incomprehensible essence the world of ideas or

primordial causes is eternally created. This is the Word or 
Son of God, in whom all things exist, so far as tbey have 
substantial existence. All existence is a theophany, and as 
God is the beginning of all things, so also is He the end. Erigena 
teaches the restitution of all things under the form of the Diony- 
sian adunatio or deificalio. These are the permanent outlines 
of what may be called the philosophy of mysticism in Christian 
times, and it is remarkable with how little variation they are 
repeated from age to age. 

In Erigena mysticism has not yet separated itself in any 
way from the dogma of the Church. There is no revulsion, 
as later, from dogma as such, nor is more stress laid upon one 
dogma than upon another; all are treated upon the same footing, 
and the whole dogmatic system is held, as it were, in solution 
by the philosophic medium in which it is presented. No 
distinction is drawn, indeed, between what is reached by reason 
and what is given by authority; the two are immediately 
identical for Erigena. In this he agrees with the speculative 
mystics everywhere, and differentiates himself from the scholas- 
tics who followed him. The distinguishing characteristic of 
scholasticism is the acceptance by reason of a given matter, 
the truth of which is independent of rational grounds, and 
which remains a presupposition even when it cannot be under- 
stood. Scholasticism aims, it is true, in its chief representatives, 
at demonstrating that the content of revelation and the teaching 
of reason are identical. But what was matter of immanent 
assumption with Erigena is in them an equating of two things 
which have been dealt with on the hypothesis that they are 
separate, and which, therefore, still retain that external relation 
to one another. This externality of religious truth to the mind 
is fundamental in scholasticism, while the opposite view is 
equally fundamental in mysticism. Mysticism is not the 
voluntary demission of reason and its subjection to an external 
authority. In that case, all who accept a revelation without 
professing to understand its content would require to be ranked 
as mystics; the fierce sincerity of Tertullian's credo quia ab- 
surdunty Pascal's reconciliation of contradictions in Jesus 
Christ, and Bayle's half-sneering subordination of reason to 
faith would all be marks of this standpoint. But such a temper 
of mind is much more akin to scepticism than to mysticism; 
it is characteristic of those who either do not feel the need of 
philosophizing their beliefs, or who have failed in doing so and 
take refuge in sheer acceptance. Mysticism, on the other hand, 
is marked on its speculative side by even an overweening 
confidence in human reason. Nor need this be wondered at if we 
consider that the unity of the human mind with the divine is 
its underlying presupposition. Hence where reason is discarded 
by the mystic it is merely reason overleaping itself; it occurs 
at the end and not at the beginning of bis speculations. Even 
then there is no appeal to authority; nothing is accepted from 
without. The appeal is still to the individual, who, if not by 
reason then by some higher faculty, claims to realize absolute 
truth and to taste absolute blessedness. 

Mysticism first appears in the medieval Church as the protest 
of practical religion against the predominance of the dialectical 
spirit. It is so with Bernard of Clairvaux (1000- 
cfairv*ux! ll Ss)> who condemns Abelard's distinctions and 
reasonings as externalizing and degrading the faith. 
St Bernard's mysticism is of a practical cast, dealing 
mainly with the means by which man may attain to the know- 
ledge and enjoyment of God. Reason has three stages, in the 
highest of which the mind is able, by abstraction from earthly 
things, to rise to contemplatio or the vision of the divine. More 
, exalted still, however, is the sudden ecstatic vision, such as was 
granted, for example, to Paul. This is the reward of those 
who are dead to the body and the world. Asceticism is thus 
the counterpart of medieval mysticism; and, by his example 
as well as by his teaching in such passages, St Bernard unhappily 
encouraged practices which necessarily resulted in self-delusion. 
Love grows with the knowledge of its object, he proceeds, and 
at the highest stage self-love is so merged in love to God that we 
love ourselves only for God's sake or because God has loved us. 



" To lose thyself in some sort, as if thou wert not, and to have 
no consciousness of thyself at all — to be emptied of thyself 
and almost annihilated — such is heavenly conversation. ... So 
to be affected is to become God." " As the little water-drop 
poured into a large measure of wine seems to lose its own nature 
entirely and to take on both the taste and the colour of the wine; 
or as iron heated red-hot loses its own appearance and glows like 
fire; or as air filled with sunlight is transformed into the same 
brightness so that it does not so much appear to be illuminated 
as to be itself light — so must all human feeling towards the 
Holy One be self-dissolved in unspeakable wise, and wholly 
transfused into the will of God. For how shall God be all in 
all if anything of man remains in man? The substance will 
indeed remain, but in another form, another glory, another 
power " (De dUigendo Deo, c. 10). These are the favourite 
similes of mysticism, wherever it is found. 

Mysticism was more systematically developed by Bernard's 
contemporary Hugh of St Victor (1006-1141). The Augustinian 
monastery of St Victor near Paris became the head- 
quarters of mysticism during the 12th century. It vMorincs. 
had a wide influence in awakening popular piety, and 
the works that issued from it formed the textbooks of mystical 
and pietistic minds in the centuries that followed. Hugh's 
pupil, Richard of St Victor, declares, in opposition to dialectic 
scholasticism, that the objects of mystic contemplation are 
partly above reason, and partly, as in the intuition of the 
Trinity, contrary to reason. He enters at length into the con- 
ditions of ecstasy and the yearnings that precede it. Walter, 
the third of the Victorines, carried on the polemic against the 
dialecticians. Bonaventura (12 21-12 74) was a diligent student 
of the Victorines, and in his Iiinerarium mentis ad Deum maps 
out the human faculties in a similar fashion. He introduces 
the terms " apex mentis " and " scintilla " (also " synderesis" 
or o-vvTTjprjcns) to describe the faculty of mystic intuition. 
Bonaventura runs riot in phrases to describe the union with 
God, and his devotional works were much drawn upon by 
mystical preachers. Fully a century later, when the system 
of scholasticism was gradually breaking up under the predomi- 
nance of Occam's nominalism, Pierre d'Aiily (13 50-1425), and 
his more famous scholar John Gerson (1363-1429), chancellor 
of the university of Paris, are found endeavouring to com- 
bine the doctrines of the Victorines and Bonaventura with a 
nominalistic philosophy. They arc the last representatives 
of mysticism within the limitations imposed by scholasticism. 

From the 1 2th and 13th centuries onward there is observable 
in the different countries of Europe a widespread reaction 
against the growing formalism and worldliness of 
the Church and the scandalous lives of many of the ^? riy 
clergy. Men began to feel a desire for a theology M™t*cs. 
of the heart and an unworldly simplicity of life. 
Thus there arose in the Netherlands the Beguines and Beghards, 
in Italy the Waldenses (without, however, any mystical leaning), 
in the south of France and elsewhere the numerous sect or sects 
of the Cathari, and in Calabria the apocalyptic gospel of Joachim 
of Floris, all bearing witness to the commotion of the time. 
The lay societies of the Beghards and the Beguines (for ' 
men and women respectively) date from the end of the 
1 2th century, and soon became extremely popular both 
in the Low Countries and on the Rhine. They were 
free at the outset from any heretical taint, but were never 
much in favour with the Church. In the beginning of the 
13th century the foundation of the Dominican and Franciscan 
orders furnished a more ecclesiastical and regular means of 
supplying the same wants, and numerous convents sprang 
up at once throughout Germany. The German mind was 
a peculiarly fruitful soil for mysticism, and, in connexion either 
with the Beguines or the Church organization, a number of 
women appear about this time, combining a spirit of mystical 
piety and asceticism with sturdy reformatory zeal directed 
against the abuses of the time. Even before this we hear of 
the prophetic visions of Hildegard of Bingen (a contemporary 
of St Bernard) and Elizabeth of Schonau. In the 13th century 



120 



MYSTICISM 



Elizabeth of Hungary, the pious landgravine of Thuringia, 
assisted in the foundation of many convents in the north of 
Germany. (For an account of the chief of these female saints 
see the first volume of W. Preger's Geschichte der deutschen 
Mystik.) Mechthild of Magdeburg appears to have been the 
most influential, and her book Das fliessende Licht der Gcttheit 
is important as the oldest work of its kind in German. It 
proves that much of the terminology of German mysticism 
was current before Eckhart's time. Mechthild's cleri co-political 
utterances show that she was acquainted with the " eternal 
gospel " of Joachim of Floris. Joachim had proclaimed the 
■doctrine of three world-ages — the kingdom of the Father, of 
the Son, and of the Spirit. The reign of the Spirit was to begin 
with the year 1 260, when the abuses of the world and the Church 
were to be effectually cured by the general adoption of the 
monastic life of contemplation. Very similar to this in appear- 
ance is the teaching of Amalric of Bena (d. 1207); but, while 
the movements just mentioned were reformatory without being 
heretical, this is very far from being the case with the mystical 
pantheism derived by Amalric from the writings of Erigena. 
His followers held a progressive revelation of God in the ages of 
the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit. Just as the Mosaic dispensation 
came to an end with the appearance of Christ, so the sacraments 
of the new dispensation have lost their meaning and efficacy 
since the incarnation of God as Holy Spirit in the Amalricans. 
With this opposition to the Church they combine a complete 
antinomianism, through the identification of all their desires 
with the impulses of the divine Spirit. Amalric's teaching 
was condemned by the Church, and his heresies led to the public 
burning of Erigena's De divisione naturae in 1225. The sect 
of the New Spirit, or of the Free Spirit as it was afterwards 
called, spread widely through the north of France and into 
Switzerland and Germany. They were especially numerous in 
the Rhineland in the end of the 13th and during the 14th cen- 
tury; and they seem to have corrupted the originally orthodox 
communities of Beghards, for Beghards and Brethren of the 
Free Spirit are used henceforward as convertible terms, and 
the same immoralities are related of both. Such was the seed- 
ground in which what is specifically known as German mysticism 
sprang up. 

In Meister Eckhart (? 1 260-13 27) tne German mind definitively 
asserts its pre-eminence in the sphere of speculative mysticism. 
Eckhart was a distinguished son of the Church; 
but in reading his works we feel at once that we 
have passed into quite a different sphere of thought from that 
of the churchly mystics; we seem to leave the cloister behind 
and to breathe a freer atmosphere. The scholastic mysticism 
was, for the most part, practical and psychological in character. 
It was largely a devotional aid to the realization of present 
union with God; and, so far as it was theoretical, it was a theory 
of the faculties by which such a union is attainable. Mysticism 
was pieced on somewhat incongruously to a scholastically 
accepted theology; the feelings and the intellect were not brought 
together. But in Eckhart the attitude of the churchman and 
traditionalist is entirely abandoned. Instead of systematizing 
dogmas, he appears to evolve a philosophy by the free exercise 
of reason. His system enables him to give a profound signifi- 
cance to the doctrines of the Church; but, instead of the system 
being accommodated to the doctrines, the doctrines — and 
especially the historical facts — acquire a new sense in the system, 
and often become only a mythical representation of speculative 
truth. The freedom with which Eckhart treats historical 
Christianity allies him much more to the German idealists of 
the 19th century than to his scholastic predecessors. 

The political circumstances of Germany in the first half of 
the 14th century were in the last degree disastrous. The war 
. between the rival emperors, Frederick of Austria and Louis 
of Bavaria, and the interdict under which the latter was placed 
in 1324 inflicted extreme misery upon the t unhappy people. 
From some places the interdict was not removed for twenty-six 
years. Men's minds were pained and disquieted by the conflict 
of duties and the absence of spiritual consolation. The country 



Eckhart 



was also visited by a succession of famines and floods, and in 
1348 the Black Death swept over Europe like a terrible scourge. 
In the midst of these unhappy surroundings religion became 
more inward in men of real piety and the desire grew among 
them to draw closer the bonds that united them to one another. 
Thus arose the society of the Friends of God (Gotlesjreunde) 
in the south and west of Germany, spreading as 
far as Switzerland on the one side and the Nether- J t h Q 0tteSm 
lands on the other. They formed no exclusive freunde." 
sect. They often took opposite sides in politics 
and they also differed in the type of their religious life; but 
they uniformly desired to strengthen one another in living 
intercourse with God. Among them chiefly the followers of 
Eckhart were to be found. Such were Heinrich Suso of Con- 
stance (1 295-1366) and Johann Tauler of Strassburg (1300- 1 361), 
the two most celebrated of his immediate disciples. Nicolas 
of Basel, the mysterious layman from whose visit Tauler dates 
his true religious life, seems to have been the chief organizing 
force among the Gottesfreunde. The society counted many 
members among the pious women in the convents of southern 
Germany. Such were Christina Ebner of Engelthal near 
Nuremberg, and Margaretha Ebner of Medingen in Swabia. 
Laymen also belonged to it, like Hermann of Fritzlar and 
Rulman Merswin, the rich banker of Strassburg (author of a 
mystical work, Buch der neun Felsen } on the nine rocks or 
upwards steps of contemplation). It was doubtless one of the 
Friends who sent forth anonymously from the house of the 
Teutonic Order in Frankfort the famous handbook of mystical 
devotion called Eine deutsche Tkeologie, first published in 1516 
by Luther. 

Jan van Ruysbroeck (1 294-1381), the father of mysticism 
in the Netherlands, stood in connexion with the Friends of God, 
and Tauler is said to have visited him in his seclusion 
at Groenendal (Vauvert, Griinthal) near Brussels. uys roec 
He was decisively influenced by Eckhart, though there is no- 
ticeable occasionally a shrinking back from some of Eckhart's 
phraseology. Ruysbroeck's mysticism is more of a practical 
than a speculative cast. He is chiefly occupied with the means 
whereby the unio mystica is to be attained, whereas Eckhart 
dwells on the union as an ever-present fact, and dilates on its 
metaphysical implications. Towards the end of Ruysbroeck's 
life, in 1378, he was visited by the fervid lay-preacher Gerhard 
Groot (1340-1384), who was so impressed by the life of the com- 
munity at Groenendal that he conceived the idea of founding a 
Christian brotherhood, bound by no monastic vows, but living 
together in simplicity and piety with all things in common, 
after the apostolic pattern. This was the origin of the Brethren 
of the Common Lot (or Common Life). The first house of 
the Brethren was founded at Deventer by Gerhard Groot and 
his youthful friend Florentius Radewyn; and here Thomas 
a Kempis (q.v.) received his training. Similar brother-houses 
soon sprang up in different places throughout the Low Countries 
and Westphab'a, and even Saxony. 

It has been customary for Protestant writers to represent 
the mystics of Germany and Holland as precursors of 
the Reformation. In a sense this is true. But Mystics 
it would be false to say that these men protested andthe Re- 
against the doctrines of the Church in the way the formation. 
Reformers felt themselves called upon to do. There is no 
sign that Tauler, for example, or Ruysbroeck, or Thomas a 
Kempis had felt the dogmatic teaching of the Church jar in 
any single point upon their religious consciousness. Never- 
theless, mysticism did prepare men in a very real way for a 
break with the traditional system. Mysticism instinctively 
recedes from formulas that have become stereotyped and 
mechanical. On the other hand its claim for spiritual freedom 
was soon to be found in opposition also to the Reformers. 

The wild doctrines of Thomas Miinzer and the Zwickau 
prophets, merging eventually into the excesses of the Later 
Peasants' War and the doings of the Anabaptists in German 
Miinster, first roused Luther to the dangerous *&***&• 
possibilities of mysticism as a disintegrating force. He was 



MYSTICISM 



127 



also called upon to do battle for his principle against men like 
Caspar Schwenkfeld (1490-1561) and Sebastian Franck (1500- 
i545)> the latter of whom developed a system of pantheistic 
mysticism, and went so far in his opposition to the letter as to 
declare the whole of the historical element in Scripture to be 
but a mythical representation of eternal truth. Valentin Weigel 
(1 533-1 588), who stands under manifold obligations to Franck, 
represents also the influence of the semi-mystical physical 
speculation that marked the transition from scholasticism to 
modern times. The final breakdown of scholasticism as a 
rationalized system of dogma may be seen in Nicolas (or 
Nicolaus) of Cusa (1401-1464), who distinguishes hetwecn the 
intellectus and the discursively acting ratio almost precisely 
in the style of later distinctions between the reason and the 
understanding. The intellect combines .what the understanding 
separates; hence Nicolas teaches the principle of the coincidentia 
contradictoriorum. If the results of the understanding go by 
the name of knowledge, then the higher teaching of the intellec- 
tual intuition may be called ignorance — ignorance, however, 
that is conscious of itself, docia ignoraniia. " Intuitio," " specu- 
lation " visio sine comprehensione," " comprehensio incom- 
prehensibilis," " mystica theologia," " tertius caelus," are some 
of the terms he applies to this knowledge above knowledge; 
but in the working out of his system he is remarkably free from 
extravagance. Nicolas's doctrines were of influence upon 
Giordano Bruno and other physical philosophers of the 15th 
and 1 6th centuries. All these physical theories are blended 
with a mystical theosophy, of which the most remarkahle 
example is, perhaps, the chemico-astrological speculations of 
Paracelsus (1493-1541). The influence of Nicolas of Cusa 
and Paracelsus mingled in Valentin Weigel with that of the 
Deutsche Theologie, Andreas Osiander, Schwenkfeld and Franck. 
Weigel, in turn, handed on these influences to Jakob Boehme 
(1 575-1624), philosophus teutonicus, and father of the chief 
developments of theosophy in modern Germany (see Boehme). 

Mysticism did not cease within the Catholic Church at the 
Reformation. In St Theresa (151 5-1 582) and John of the Cross 
other the counter-reformation can boast of saints second 
Forms of to none in the calendar for the austerity of their 
Mysticism, mortifications and the rapture of the visions to 
which they were admitted. But, as was to be expected, 
their mysticism moves in that comparatively narrow round, 
and consists simply in the heaping up of these sensuous 
experiences. The speculative character has entirely faded 
out of it, or rather has heen crushed out by the tightness with 
which the directors of the Roman Church now held the reins 
of discipline. Their mysticism represents, therefore, no widening 
or spiritualizing of their theology; in all matters of belief they 
remain the docile children of their Church. The gloom and 
harshness of these Spanish mystics are absent from the tender, 
contemplative spirit of Francois de Sales (1567-1622); and in 
the quietism of Mme Guyon (1648-1717) and Miguel de 
Molinos (1627-1696) there is again a sufficient implication of 
mystical doctrine to rouse the suspicion of the ecclesiastical 
authorities. Quietism, name and thing, became the talk of 
all the world through the bitter and protracted controversy to 
which it gave rise between Fenelon and Bossuet. 

In the 17th century mysticism is represented in the philo- 
sophical field by the so-called Cambridge Platonists, and 
especially by Henry More (1614-1687), in whom the influence 
of the Kabbalah is combined with a species of christianized 
Neoplatonism. Pierre Poiret (1646-1719) exhibits a violent 
reaction against the mechanical philosophy of Descartes, and 
especially against its consequences in Spinoza. He was an 
ardent student of Taulcr and Thomas a Kempis, and became 
an adherent of the quietistic doctrines of Mme Bourignon. 
His philosophical works emphasize the passivity of the reason. 
The first influence of Boehme was in the direction of an obscure 
religious mysticism. J. G. Gichtel (1 638-1 710), the first editor 
of his complete works, became the founder of a sect called the 
Angel-Brethren. All Boehme's works were translated into 
English in the time of the Commonwealth, and regular societies 



of Boehmenists were formed in England and Holland. Later in 
the century he was much studied by the members of the 
Philadelphian Society, John Pordage, Thomas Bromley, Jane 
Lead, and others. The mysticism of William Law (1686-1761) 
and of Louis Claude de Saint Martin in France (1743-1803), 
who were also students of Boehme, is of a much more elevated 
and spiritual type. The " Cherubic Wanderer," and other 
poems, of Johann Scheffier (1624-1677), known as Angelus 
Silesius, are more closely related in style and thought to 
Eckhart than to Boehme. 

The religiosity of the Quakers, with their doctrines of the 
" inner light " and the influence of the Spirit, has decided 
affinities with mysticism; and the autobiography of George 
Fox (1624-1691), the founder of the sect, proceeds throughout 
on the assumption of supernatural guidance. Stripped of its 
definitely miraculous character, the doctrine of the inner light 
may be regarded as the familiar mystical protest against for- 
malism, literalism, and scripture-worship. Swedenborg, though 
selected hy Emerson in his Representative Men as the typical 
mystic, belongs rather to the history of spiritualism than to 
that of mysticism as understood in this article. He possesses 
the cool temperament of the man of science rather than the 
fervid Godward aspiration of the mystic proper; and the specu- 
lative impulse which lies at the root of this form of thought 
is almost entirely ahsent from his writings. Accordingly, his 
supernatural revelations resemble a course of lessons in celestial 
geography more than a description of the beatific vision. 

Philosophy since the end of the 18th century has frequently 
shown a tendency to diverge into mysticism. This has been espe- 
cially so in Germany. The term mysticism is indeed often extended 
by popular usage and philosophical partisanship to the whole activity 
of the post-Kantian idealists. In this usage the word would be 
equivalent to the more recent and scarcely less abused term, tran- 
scendentalism, and as such it is used even by a sympathetic writer 
like Carlyle; but this looseness of phraseology only serves to blur 
important distinctions. However absolute a philosopher's idealism 
may be, he is erroneously styled a mystic if he moves towards his 
conclusions only by the patient labour of the reason. Hegel there- 
fore, to take an instance, can no more fitly be classed as a mystic 
than Spinoza can. It would be much nearer the truth to take both 
as types of a thoroughgoing rationalism. In either case it is of course 
open to anyone to maintain that the apparent completeness of 
synthesis really rests on the subtle intrusion of elements of feeling 
into the rational^ process. But in that case it might be difficult to 
find b. systematic philosopher who would escape the charge of 
mysticism; airi it is better to remain by long-established and 
serviceable distinctions. So, again, when R6cejac defines mysti- 
cism as " the tendency to draw near to the Absolute in moral union 
by symbolic means," the definition, as developed by him, is one 
which would apply to the philosophy of Kant. R6c6jac's interesting 
work, Les Fondements de la connaissance mystique (Eng. trans. 1899), 
though it touches mysticism at various points, and quotes from 
mystic writers, is in fact a protest against the limitations of experi- 
ence to the data of the senses and the pure reason to the exclusion 
of the moral consciousness and the deliverances of " the heart." 
But such a position is not describable as mysticism in any recognized 
sense. On the other hand, where philosophy despairs of itself, 
exults in its own overthrow, and yet revels in the " mysteries " of a 
speculative Christianity, as in T. G. Hamann (1730-1788), the term 
mysticism may be fitly applied. So, again, it is in place where the 
movement of revulsion from a mechanical philosophy takes the 
form rather of immediate assertion than of reasoned demonstration, 
and where the writers, after insisting generally on the spiritual 
basis of phenomena, either leave the position without further defini- 
tion or expressly declare that the ultimate problems of philosophy 
cannot be reduced to articulate formulas. Examples of this are 
men like Novalis, Carlyle and Emerson, in whom philosophy may be 
said to be impatient of its own task. Schilling's explicit appeal 
in the Hentitdts-philosophie to an intellectual intuition of the 
Absolute, is of the essence of mysticism, both as an appeal to a supra- 
rational faculty and as a claim not merely to know but to realize 
God. The opposition of the reason to the understanding, as formu- 
lated by S. T. Coleridge, is not free from the first of these faults. 
The later philosophy of Schelling and the philosophy of Franz 
von Baadcr, both largely founded upon Boehme, belong rather to 
theosophy (q.v.) than to mysticism proper.

MYTHOLOGY (Gr. itvOoXoryla, the science which examines 
IwOot, myths or legends of cosmogony and of gods and 
heroes. Mythology is also used as a term for these legends 
themselves. Thus when we speak of " the mythology of Greece " 
we mean the whole body of Greek divine and heroic and cosmo- 
gonic legends. When we speak of the" science of mythology " 
we refer to the various attempts which have been made to 
explain these ancient narratives. Very early indeed in the 
history of human thought men awoke to the consciousness 
that their religious stories were much in want of explanation. 
The myths of civilized peoples, as of Greeks and the Aryans of 
India, contain two elements, the rational and what to modern 
minds seems the irrational. The rational myths are those 
which represent the gods as beautiful and wise beings. The 
Artemis of the Odyssey " taking her pastime in the chase of 
boars and swift deer, while with her the wild wood-nymphs 
disport them, and high over them all she rears her brow, and 
is easily to be known where all are fair," is a perfectly rational 
mythic representation of a divine being. We feel, even now, 
that the conception of a " queen and huntress, chaste and fair," 
the lady warden of the woodlands, is a beautiful and natural 
fancy which requires no explanation. On the other hand, the 
Artemis of Arcadia, who is confused with the nymph Callisto, 
who, again, is said to have become a she-bear, and later a star, 
and the Brauronian Artemis, whose maiden ministers danced 
a bear-dance, are goddesses 'whose * legend seems unnatural, 
and is felt to need explanation. Or, again, there is nothing 
not explicable and natural in the conception of the Olympian 
Zeus as represented by the great chryselephantine statue of 
Zeus at Olympia, or in the Homeric conception of Zeus as a god 
who " turns everywhere his shining eyes " and beholds all 
things. But the Zeus whose grave was shown in Crete, or the 
Zeus who played Demeter an obscene trick by the aid of a ram, 
or the Zeus who, in the shape of a swan, became the father of 
Castor and Pollux, or the Zeus who was merely a rough stone, 
or the Zeus who deceived Hera by means of a feigned marriage 
with an inanimate object, or the Zeus who was afraid of Attes, 
is a being whose myth is felt to be unnatural and in great need 
of explanation. It is this irrational and unnatural element — 
as Max Muller says, " the silly, savage and senseless element " 
— that makes mythology the puzzle which men have so long 
found it. 

Early Explanations of Myths. — The earliest attempts at a 
crude science of mythology were efforts to reconcile the legends 
of the gods and heroes with the religious sentiment which 
recognized in these beings objects of worship, and respect. 
Closely as religion and myth are intertwined, it is necessary 
to hold them apart for the purposes of this discussion. Religion 
may here be defined as the conception of divine, or at least 
supernatural powers entertained by men in moments of gratitude 
or of need and distress, in hours of weakness, when, as Homer 
says, " all folk yearn after the gods." Now this conception 
may be rude enough, and it is nearly related to purely 
magical ideas, to efforts to secure supernatural aid by 
magical ceremonies. Still the roughest form of spiritual 
prayer has for its basis the hypothesis of beneficent beings, 
visible or invisible. The senseless stories or myths about 
the gods are soon felt to be at variance with this hypothesis. 
As an example we may take the instance of Qing, the 
Bushman hunter. Qing, when first he met white men, was 
asked about his religion. He began to explain, and mentioned 
-Cagn. Mr Orpen, the chief magistrate of St John's Terri- 
tory, asked: " Is Cagn good or malicious? how do you pray 
to him?" Answer (in a low imploring tone): " 'O Cagn! 
O Cagn! are we not your children? do you not see our hun- 
ger? give us food;' and he gives us both hands full " (Cape 
Monthly Magazine, July 1874). Here we see the religious 



view t of Cagn, the Bushman god. But in the mythological 
account of Cagn given by Qing he appears as a kind of grass- 
hopper, supernaturally endowed, the hero of a most absurd 
cycle of senseless adventures. Even religion is affected by these 
irrational /lotions, and the gods of savages and of many civilized 
peoples are worshipped with cruel, obscene, and irrational 
rites. But, on the whole, the religious sentiment strives to 
transcend the mythical conceptions of the gods, and is shocked 
and puzzled by the mythical narratives. As soon as this sense 
of perplexity is felt by poets, by priests, or by most men in an 
age of nascent criticism, explanations of what is most crude and 
absurd in the myths are put forward. Men ask themselves 
why their gods are worshipped in the form of beasts, birds, and 
fishes; why their gods are said to have prosecuted their amours 
in bestial shapes; why they are represented as lustful and passion- 
ate^ — thieves, robbers, murderers and adulterers. The answers 
to these questions sometimes become myths themselves. Thus 
both the Mangaians and the Egyptians have been puzzled by 
their own gods in the form of beasts. The Egyptians invented an 
explanation — itself a myth — that in some moment of danger 
the gods concealed themselves from their foes in the shapes 
of animals. 1 .The Mangaians, according to W. W. Gill, hold 
that " the heavenly family had taken up their abode in these 
birds, fishes, and reptiles." 2 

t A people so curious and refined as the Greeks were certain 
to be greatly perplexed by even such comparatively pure 
mythical narratives as they found in Homer, still more by 
the coarser legends of Hesiod, and above all by the ancient 
local myths preserved by local priesthoods. Thus, in the 6th 
century before Christ, Xenophanes of Colophon severely blamed 
the poets for their unbecoming legends, and boldly called certain 
myths "the fables of men of old." 3 Theagenes of Rhegium 
(520 B.C.?), according to the scholiast on Iliad, xx. 67,* was the 
author of a very ancient system of mythology. Admitting 
that the fable of the battle of the gods was " unbecoming," if 
literally understood, Theagenes represented it as an allegorical* 
account of the war of the elements. Apollo, Helios, and 
Hephaestus were fire, Hera was air, Poseidon was water, Artemis 
was the moon, wu ra Xowrd ojlwhojs. Or, by another system, the 
names of the gods represented moral and intellectual qualities. 
Heraclitus, too, disposed of the myth of the bondage of Hera 
as allegorical philosophy. Socrates, in the Cratylus of Plato, 
expounds " a philosophy which came to him all in an instant," 
an explanation of the divine beings based on crude philological 
analyses of their names. Metrodorus, rivalling some recent 
flights of conjecture, resolved not only the gods but even heroes 
like Agamemnon, Hector and Achilles " into elemental combina- 
tions and physical agencies." 5 Euripides makes Pentheus 
(but he was notoriously impious) advance a " rationalistic " 
theory of the story that Dionysus was stitched up in the thigh 
of Zeus. 

^ When Christianity became powerful the heathen philosophers 
evaded its satire by making more and more use of the allegorical 
and non-natural system of explanation. That method has 
two faults. First (as Arnobius and Eusebius reminded their 
heathen opponents), the allegorical explanations are purely 
arbitrary, depend upon the fancy of their author, and are 
all equally plausible and equally unsupported by evidence. 6 
Secondly, there is no proof at all that, in the distant age when 
the myths were developed, men entertained the moral notions 
and physical philosophies which are supposed to be " wrapped 
up, " as Cicero says, " in impious fables." Another system of 
explanation is that associated with the name of Euemerus 
(316 B.C.). According to this author, the myths are history 
in disguise. All the gods were once men, whose real feats have 
been decorated and distorted by later fancy. This view suited 
Lactantius, St Augustine and other early Christian writers

very well. They were pleased to believe that Euemerus " by 
historical' research had ascertained that the gods were once but 
mortal men." Precisely the same convenient line was taken 
by Sahagun in his account of Mexican religious myths. As 
there can be no doubt that the ghosts of dead men have been 
worshipped in 'many lands, and as the gods of many faiths are 
tricked out with attributes derived from ancestor-worship, 
the system of Euemerus retains some measure of plausibility: 
While we need not believe with Euemerus and with Herbert 
Spencer that the god of Greece or the god of the Hottentots 
was once a man, we cannot deny that the myths of both these 
gods have passed through and been coloured by the imaginations 
of men who practised the worship of real ancestors. For 
example, the Cretans showed the tomb of Zeus, and the Phocians 
(Pausanias x. 5) daily poured blood of victims into the tomb 
of a hero, obviously by way of feeding his ghost. The 
Hottentots show many tombs of their god, Tsui-Goab, and tell 
tales about his death; they also pray regularly for aid at the 
tombs of their own parents. 1 We may therefore say that, 
while it is rather absurd to believe that Zeus and Tsui-Goab 
were once real men, yet their myths are such as would be 
developed by people accustomed, among other forms of religion, 
to the worship of dead men. Very probably portions of the 
legends of real men have been attracted into the mythic accounts 
of gods of another character, and this is the element of truth 
at the bottom of Euemerism. 

Later Explanations of Mythology. — The ancient systems of 
explaining what needed explanation in myths were, then, 
physical, ethical, religious and historical. One student, like 
Theagenes, would see a physical philosophy underlying Homeric 
legends. Another, like Porphyry, would imagine that the 
meaning was partly moral, partly of a dark theosophic and 
religious character. Another would detect moral allegory 
alone, and Aristotle expresses the opinion that the myths were 
the inventions of legislators " to persuade the many, and to 
be used in support of law " (Met. xi. 8, 19). A fourth, like 
Euemerus, would get rid of the supernatural element altogether, 
and find only an imaginative rendering of actual history. When 
Christians approached the problem of heathen mythology, 
they sometimes held, with St Augustine, a form of the doctrine 
of Euemerus. 2 In other words, they regarded Zeus, Aphrodite 
and the rest as real persons, diabolical not divine.'" Some later 
philosophers, especially of the 17th century, misled by the resem- 
■ blance between Biblical narratives and ancient myths, came to 
the conclusion that the Bible contains a pure, the myths a 
distorted, form of an original revelationH The abbe Banier 
published a mythological compilation in which he systematically 
resolved all the Greek myths into ordinary history. 3 Bryant 
published (1774) -4 New System, or an Analysis of Ancient 
Mythology >, wherein an Attempt is made to divest Tradition of Fable, 
in which he talked very learnedly of " that wonderful people, the 
descendants of Cush," and saw everywhere symbols of the ark 
and traces of the Noachian deluge. Thomas Taylor, at the end 
of the 18th century, indulged in much mystical allegorizing 
of myths, as in the notes to his translation of Pausanias (1794). 
At an earlier date (1760) De Brosses struck on the true line of 
interpretation in his little work Du Culte des dieux fetiches, 
ou parallble de Vancienne religion de l'£gypte avec la religion 
actuelle de Nigritie. In this tract De Brosses explained the 
animal-worship of the Egyptians as a survival among a 
civilized people of ideas and practices springing from the 
intellectual condition of savages, and actually existing among 
negroes. A vast symbolical explanation of myths and mysteries 
was attempted by Friedrich Creuzer. 4 The learning and sound 
.sense of Lobeck, in his Aglaophamus, exploded the idea that the 
Eleusinian and other mysteries revealed or concealed matter 
of momentous religious importance. It ought not to be forgotten

that Lafitau, a Jesuit missionary in North America, while 
inclined to take a mystical view of the secrets concealed 
by Iroquois myths, had also pointed out the savage element 
surviving in Greek mythology. 5 

Recent Mythological Systems. — Up to a very recent date 
students of mythology were hampered by orthodox traditions, 
and still more by ignorance of the ancient languages and of 
the natural history of man. Only recently have Sanskrit and 
the Egyptian and Babylonian languages become books not 
absolutely sealed. Again, the study of the evolution. of human 
institutions from the lowest savagery to civilization is essentially 
a novel branch of research, though ideas derived from an 
unsystematic study of anthropology are at least as old as 
Aristotle.' The new theories of mythology are based on the 
belief that " it is man, it is human thought and human 
language combined, which naturally and necessarily pro- 
duced the strange conglomerate of ancient fable." 6 *But, while 
there is now universal agreement so far, modern mythologists 
differed essentially on one point. There was a school (with 
internal divisions) which regarded ancient fable as almost 
entirely " a disease of language," that is, as the result of con- 
fusions arising from misunderstood terms that have survived in 
speech after their original significance was lost. Another school 
(also somewhat divided against itself) believes that misunder- 
stood language played but a very slight part in the evolu- 
tion of mythology, and that the irrational element in myths 
is merely the survival from a condition of thought which was 
once common, if not universal, but is now found chiefly among 
savages, and to a certain extent among children. The former 
school considered that the state of thought out of which myths 
were developed was produced by decaying language; the latter 
maintains that the corresponding phenomena of language were 
the reflection of thought. For the sake of brevity we might 
call the former the " philological " system, as it rests chiefly 
on the study of language, while the latter might be styled the 
" historical " or " anthropological " school, as it is based on 
the study of man in the sum of his manners, ideas and insti- 
tutions. 

The System of Max Muller. — The most distinguished and popular 
advocate of the philological 'school was Max Muller, whose views 
may be found in his Selected Essays and Lectures on Language. The 
problem was to explain what he calls " the silly, savage and senseless 
element " in mythology (SeL Ess. 1. 578^. Max Miiller says (speaking 
of the Greeks), " their poets had an instinctive aversion to every- 
thing excessive or monstrous, yet they would relate of their gods 
what would make the most savage of Red Indians creep and 
shudder " — stories, that is, of the cannibalism of Demeter, of the 
mutilation of Uranus, the cannibalism of Cronus, who swallowed 
his own children, and the like. " Among the lowest tribes of Africa 
and America we hardly find anything more hideous and revolting." 

Max Muller refers the beginning of his system of mythology to 
the discovery of the connexion of the Indo-European or, as they 
are called, " Aryan " languages. Celts, Germans, speakers of 
Sanskrit and Zend, Latins and Greeks, all prove by their languages 
that their tongues may be traced to one family of speech. The 
comparison of the various words which, in different forms, are com- 
mon to all Indo-European^ languages must inevitably throw much 
light on the original meaning of these words. Take, for example, 
the nameof a god, Zeus, or Athene, or any other. The word may 
have no intelligible meaning in Greek, but its counterpart in the 
allied tongues, especially in Sanskrit or Zend, may reveal the original 
significance of the terms. " To understand the origin and meaning 
ofthe names of the Greek gods, and to enter into the original intention 
of the fables told of each, we must take into account the collateral 
evidence supplied by Latin, German, Sanskrit and Zend philology " 
(Led. on Lang., 2nd series, p. 406). A name may be intelligible in 
Sanskrit which has no sense in Greek. Thus Athene is a divine name 
without meaning in Greek, but Max Muller advances reasons for 
supposing that it is identical with ahana, " the dawn," in Sanskrit. 
It is his opinion, apparently, that whatever story is told of Athene 
must have originally been told of the dawn, and that we must keep 
this before us in attempting to understand the legends of Athene. 
Thus again (op. cit. p. 410), he says, ,( we have a right to explain 
all that is told of him (Agni, " fire ") " as originally meant for fire." 
The system is simply this: the original meaning of the names of gods 
must be ascertained by comparative philology. The names, as a 
rule, will be found to denote elemental phenomena. And the silly,

MYTHOLOGY 



savage and senseless elements in the legends of the gods will be shown 
to have a natural significance, as descriptions of sky, storms, sunset, 
water, fire, dawn, twilight, the life of earth, and other celestial and 
terrestrial existences. Stated in the barest form, these results do 
not differ greatly from the conclusions of Theagenes of Rhegium, 
who held that " Hephaestus was fire, Hera was air, Poseidon was 
water, Artemis was tne moon, Kal tA Xoixd 6/w(a>s." But Max Muller's 
system is based on scientific philology, not on conjecture, and is 
supported by a theory of the various processes in the evolution of 
myths out of language. 

It is no longer necessary to give an elaborate analysis of this theory, 
because neither in its philological nor mythological side has it any 
advocates who need be reckoned with. The attempt to disengage 
the history of times forgotten and unknown, by means of analysis 
of roots and words in Aryan languages, has been unsuccessful, or 
has at best produced disputable results. Max Muller's system was a 
result of the philological theories that indicated the linguistic unity 
of the Indo-European or " Aryan " peoples, and was founded on an 
analysis of their language. But myths precisely similar in irrational 
and repulsive character, even in minute details, to those of the 
Aryan races, exist among Australians, South Sea Islanders, Eskimo, 
Bushmen in Africa, among Solomon Islanders, Iroquois, and so 
forth. The facts being identical, an identical explanation should 
be sought, and, as the languages in which the myths exist are essen- 
tially different, an explanation founded on the Aryan language is 
likely to prove too narrow. Once more, even if we discover the 
original meaning of a god's name, it does not follow that we can 
explain by aid of the significance of the name the myths about the 
god. For nothing is more common than the attraction of a more 
ancient story into the legend of a later god or hero. Myths of un- 
known antiquity, for example, have been attracted into the legend 
of Charlemagne, just as the bons mots of old wits are transferred 
to living humorists. Therefore, though we may ascertain that Zeus 
means " sky " and Agni " fire," we cannot assert, with Max Muller, 
that all the myths about Agni and Zeus were originally told of 
fire and sky. When*these gods became popular they would inevit- 
ably inherit any current exploits of earlier heroes or gods. These 
exploits would therefore be explained erroneously if regarded as 
originally myths of sky or fire. We cannot convert Max M tiller's 
proposition " there was nothing told of the sky that could not in 
some form or other be ascribed to Zeus" into there was nothing 
ascribed to Zeus that had not at some time or other been told of the 
sky." This is also, perhaps, the proper place to observe that names 
derived from natural phenomena— sky, clouds, dawn and sun — 
are habitually assigned by Brazilians, Ojibways, Australians and 
other savages to living menand women. Thus the story originally 
told of a man or woman bearing the name " sun," " dawn," " cloud, 
may be mixed up later with myths about the real celestial dawn, 
cloud or sun. For all these reasons the information obtained from 
philological analysis of names is to be distrusted. We must also 
bear in mind that early men when they conceived, and savage men 
when they conceive, of the sun, moon, wind, earth, sky and so forth, 
have no such ideas in their minds as we attach to these names. 
They think of sun, moon, wind, earth and sky as of living human 
beings with bodily parts and passions. Thus, even when we dis- 
cover an elemental meaning in a god's name, that meaning may be 
all unlike what the word suggests to civilized men. A final objection 
is that philologists differ widely as to the true analysis and real 
meaning of the divine names. Max Muller, for example, connects 
Kronos (Kp6vos) with jcp6vos t "time"; Preller with Kpatvoo, "I fulfil," 
and so forth. 

The civilized men of the Mythopoeic age were not obliged, as 
Max Muller held, to believe that all phenomena were persons, 
because the words which denoted the phenomena had gender- 
terminations. On the other hand, the gender-terminations were 
survivals from an early stage of thought in which personal character- 
istics, including sex, had been attributed to all phenomena. This 
condition of thought is demonstrated to be, and to have been, 
universal among savages, and it may notoriously be observed among 
children. Thus Max Muller's theory that myths are " a disease of 
language " seems destitute of evidence, and inconsistent with what 
is historically known about the relations between the language and 
the social, political and literary condition of men. 

Theory of Herbert Spencer.— The system of Herbert Spencer, as 
explained in Principles of Sociology \ has many points in common 
with that of Max Muller. Spencer attempts to account for the state 
of mind (the foundation of myths) in which man personifies and 
animates all phenomena. According to his theory, too, this habit 
of mind may be regarded as the result of degeneration, for in his 
view, as in Max Muller's, it is not primary, but the result of miscon- 
ceptions. But, while language is the chief cause of misconceptions 
with Max Muller, with Spencer it is only one of several forces all 
working to the same result. Statements which originally had a 
different significance are misinterpreted, he thinks, and names of 
human beings are also misinterpreted in such a manner that early 
races are gradually led to believe in the personality of phenomena. 
He too notes " the defect in early speech " — that is, tne " lack of 
words free from implications of vitality " — as one of the causes 
which " favour personalization." Here, of course, we have to ask 
Spencer, with Max Muller, why words in early languages " imply 



vitality." These words must reflect the thought of the men who use 
them before they react upon that thought and confirm it in its mis- 
conceptions. So far Spencer seems at one with the philological 
school of mycologists, but he warns us that the misconstructions 
of language in his system are" different inland, and the erroneous 
course of thought is opposite in direction." According to Spencer 
(and his premises, at least, are correct), the names of human beings 
in an early state of society are derived from incidents of the moment, 
and often refer to the period of the day or the nature of the weather. 
We find, among Australian natives, among Abipones in South 
America, and among Ojibways in the North, actual people named 
Dawn.Gold Flower of Day, Dark Cloud, Sun, and so forth. Spencer's 
argument is that, given a story about real people so named, in process 
of time and forgetfulness the anecdote which was once current 
about a man named Storm and a woman named Sunshine will be 
transferred to the meteorological phenomena of sun and tempest. 
Thus these purely natural agents will come to be " personalized " 
(Prin. Soc. 392), and to be credited with purely human origin and 
human adventur.es. Another misconception would arise when men 
had a tradition that they came to their actual seats from this moun- 
tain, or that lake or river, or from lands across the sea. They will 
mistake this tradition of local origin for one of actual parentage, 
and will come to believe that, like certain Homeric heroes, they are 
the sons of a river (now personified), or of a mountain, or, like a 
tribe mentioned by Garcilasso de la Vega, that they are descended 
from the sea. Once more, if their old legend told them that they 
came from the rising sun, they will hold, like many races, that they 
are actually the children of the sun. By this process of forgetfulness 
and misinterpretation, mountains, rivers, lakes, sun and sea would 
receive human attributes, while men would degenerate from a more 
sensible condition into a belief in the personality and vitality of 
inanimate objects. As Spencer thinks ancestor-worship the first 
form of religion, and as he holds that persons with such names as 
sun, moon and the like became worshipped as ancestors, his theory 
results in the belief that nature- worship and the myths about natural 
phenomena — dawn, wind, sky, night and the rest — are a kind of 
transmuted worship of ancestors and transmuted myths about real 
men and women. " Partly by confounding the parentage of the 
race with a^ conspicuous object marking the natal region of the race, 
partly by literal interpretation of birth names, and partly by literal 
interpretation of names given in eulogy " (such as Sun and Bull, 
among the Egyptian kings), and also through " implicit belief in 
the statements of forefathers," there has been produced belief in 
descent from mountains, sea, dawn, from animals which have become 
constellations, and from persons once on earth who now appear 
as sun and moon. A very common class of myths (see Totemism) 
assures us that certain stocks of men are descended from beasts, 
or from gods in the shape of beasts. Spencer explains these by the 
theory that the remembered ancestor of a stock had, as savages 
often have, an animal name, as Bear, Wolf, Coyote, or what not. 
In time his descendants came to forget that the name was a mere 
name, and were misled into the opinion that they were children of a 
real coyote, wolf or bear. This idea, once current, would naturally 
stimulate and diffuse the belief that such descents were possible, 
and that the animals are closely akin to men. 

The chief objection to these processes is that they require, as a 
necessary condition, a singular amount of memory on the one hand 
and of forgetfulness on the other. The lowest contemporary savages 
remember little or nothing of any ancestor farther back than the 
grandfather. But men in Spencer's Mythopoeic age had much 
longer memories. On the other hand, the most ordinary savage 
does not misunderstand so universal a custom as the imposition of 
names peculiar to animals or derived from atmospheric phenomena. 
He calls his own child Dawn or Cloud, his own nameis Sitting Bull 
or Running Wolf, and he is not tempted to explain his great-grand- 
father's name of Bright Sun or Lively Raccoon on the hypothesis 
that the ancestor really was a raccoon or the sun. Moreover, 
savages do not worship ancestresses or retain lively memories of 
their great-grandmothers, yet it is through the female line in the 
majority of cases that the animal or other ancestral name is derived. 
The son of an Australian male, whose kin or totem name is Crane, 
takes, in many tribes, his mother's kin-name, Swan or Cockatoo, 
or whatever it may be, and the same is a common rule in Africa and 
America among races who rarely remember their great-grandfathers. 
On the whole, then (though degeneracy, as well as progress, is a 
force in human evolution), we are not tempted to believe in so strange 
a combination of forgetfulness with long memory, nor so excessive 
a degeneration from common sense into a belief in the personality 
of phenomena, as are required no less by Spencer's system than by 
that of Max Muller. 

Preliminary Problems. — We have stated and criticized the 
more prominent modern theories of mythology. It is now 
necessary first to recapitulate the chief points in the problem, 
and then to attempt to explain them by a comparison of the 
myths of various races. The difficulty of mythology is to 
account for the following among other apparently irrational 
elements in myths: the wild and senseless stories of the 



MYTHOLOGY 



131 



beginnings of things, of the origin of men, sun, stars, animals, 
death, and the world in general; the infamous and absurd adven- 
tures of the gods; why divine beings are regarded as incestuous, 
adulterous, murderous, .thievish, cruel, cannibals, and addicted to 
wearing the shapes of animals, and subject to death in some 
stories; the myths of metamorphosis into plants, beasts and 
stars; the repulsive stories of the state of the dead; the descents 
of the gods into the place of the dead, and their return thence. It 
is extremely difficult to keep these different categories of myths 
separate from each other. If we investigate myths of the origin 
of the world, we often find gods in animal form active in the 
work of world-making. If we examine myths of human descent 
from animals, we find gods busy there, and if we try to investigate 
the myths of the origin of the gods, the subject gets mixed up 
with the mythical origins of things in general. 

Our first question will be, Is there any stage of human society, 
and of the human intellect, in which facts that appear to us 
to be monstrous and irrational are accepted as ordinary occur- 
rences of every day life ? E. W. Lane, in his preface to the 
Arabian Nights, says that the Arabs have an advantage over 
us as story-tellers. They can introduce such incidents as the 
change of a man into a horse, or of a woman into a dog, or the 
intervention of an afreet, without any more scruple than our 
own novelists feel in describing a duel or the concealment of 
a will. Among the Arabs the actions of magic and of spirits 
are regarded as at least as probable and common as duels and 
concealments of wills in European society. It is obvious that 
we need look no farther for the explanation of the supernatural 
events in Arab romances. Now let us apply this system to 
mythology. It is admitted that Greeks, Romans, Aryans of 
India in the age of the Sanskrit commentators, Egyptians of 
the Ptolemaic and earlier ages, were as much puzzled as we are 
by the mythical adventures of their gods. But is there any 
known stage of the human intellect in which these divine 
adventures, and the metamorphoses of men into animals, trees, 
stars, and converse with the dead, and all else that puzzles us 
in the civilized mythologies, are regarded as possible incidents 
of daily human life? Our answer is that everything in the 
civilized mythologies which we regard as irrational seems only 
part of the accepted and rational order of things (at least in 
the case of " medicine-men " or magicians) to contemporary 
savages, and in the past seemed equally rational and natural 
to savages concerning whom we have historical information. 
Our theory is, therefore, that the savage and senseless element in 
mythology is, for the most part, a legacy from ancestors of 
the civilized races who were in an intellectual state not higher 
than that of Australians, Bushmen, Red Indians, the lower races 
of South America, Mincopies, and other worse than barbaric 
peoples. As the ancestors of the Greeks, with the Aryans of 
India, the Egyptians, and others advanced in civilization, 
their religious thought was shocked and surprised by myths 
(originally dating from the period of savagery, and natural 
in that period) which were preserved down to the time of 
Pausanias by local priesthoods, or which were stereotyped in 
the ancient poems of Hesiod and Homer, or in the Brahmanas 
' and Vedas of India, or were retained in the popular religion 
of Egypt. This theory recommended itself to Lobeck. " We 
may believe that ancient and early tribes framed gods like 
themselves in action and in experience, and that the allegorical 
element in myths is the addition of later peoples who had 
attained to purer ideas of divinity, yet dared not reject the 
religion of their ancestors " (Aglaoph. i. 153). The senseless 
element in the myths would by this theory be for the most part 
a " survival." And the age and condition of human thought 
from which it survived would be one in which our most ordinary 
ideas about the nature of things and the limits of possibility 
did not yet exist, when all things were conceived of in quite 
other fashion — the age, that is, of savagery. It is universally 
admitted that " survivals " of this kind do account for many 
anomalies in out institutions, in law, politics, society, even in 
dress and manners. If isolated fragments of an earlier age 
abide in these, it is still more probable that other fragments 



will survive in anything so closely connected as mythology 
with the conservative religious sentiment. 

If this view of mythology can be proved, much will have been 
done to explain a problem which we .have not yet touched, namely, 
the distribution of myths. The science of mythology has to account, 
if it can, not only for the existence of certain stories in the legends 
of certain races, but also for the presence of stories practically 
the same among almost all races. In the long history of mankind 
it is impossible to deny that stories may conceivably have 
spread from a single centre, and been handed on from races like 
the Indo-European and the Semitic to races as far removed 
from them in every way as the Zulus, the Australians, the 
Eskimo, the natives of the South Sea Islands. But, while the 
possibility of the diffusion of myths by borrowing and 
transmission must be allowed for, the hypothesis of the 
origin of myths in the -savage state of the intellect supplies 
a ready explanation of their wide diffusion. Archaeologists 
are acquainted with objects of early art and craftsmanship, 
rude clay pipkins and stone weapons, which can only be classed 
as " human," and which do not bear much impress of any one 
national taste and skill. Many myths may be called " human " 
in this sense. They are the rough products of the early human 
mind, and are not yet characterized by the differentiations 
of race and culture. Such myths might spring up anywhere 
among untutored men, and anywhere might survive into civilized 
literature. Therefore where similar myths are found among 
Greeks, Australians, Egyptians, Mangaians and others, it is 
unnecessary to account for their wide diffusion by any hypothesis 
of borrowing, early or late. The Greek " key " pattern found 
on objects in Peruvian graves was not necessarily borrowed 
from Greece, nor did Greeks necessarily borrow from Aztecs 
the " wave " pattern which is common to both. The same 
explanation may be applied to Greek and Aztec myths of the 
deluge, to Australian and Greek myths of the original theft 
of fire. Borrowed they may have been, but they may as probably 
have been independent inventions. 

It is true that some philologists deprecate as unscientific the com- 
parison cf myths which are found in languages not connected with 
each other. The objection rests on the theory that myths are a 
disease of language, a morbid offshoot of language, and that the 
legends in unconnected languages must therefore be kept apart. 
But, as the theory which we are explaining does not admit that 
language is^ more than a subordinate cause in the development of 
myths, as it seeks for the origin of myths in a given condition of 
thought through which all races have passed, we need do no more 
than record the objection. 

The Intellectual Condition of Savages* — Our next step must 
be briefly to examine the intellectual condition of savages, 
that is, of races varying from the condition of the Andaman 
Islanders to that of the Solomon Islanders and the ruder Red 
Men of the American continent. In a developed treatise on the 
subject of mythology it would be necessary to criticize, with 
a minuteness which is impossible here, our evidence for the 
very peculiar mental condition of the lower races. Max Miiller 
asked (when speaking of the mental condition of men when 
myths were developed), " was there a period of temporary 
madness through which the human mind had to pass, and was 
it a madness identically the same in the south of India and the 
north of Iceland? " To this we may answer that the human 
mind had to pass through the savage stage of thought, that this 
stage was for all practical purposes " identically the same " 
everywhere, and that to civilized observers it does resemble 
" a temporary madness." Many races are still abandoned to 
that temporary madness; many others which have escaped 
from it were observed and described while still labouring under 
its delusions. Our evidence for the intellectual ideas of man 
in the period of savagery we derive partly from the reports of 
voyagers, historians, missionaries, partly from an examination 
of the customs, institutions, and laws in which the lower races 
gave expression to their notions. 

As to the first kind of evidence, we must be on our guard against 
several sources of error. Where religion is concerned, travellers 
in general and missionaries in particular are biased in several distinct 



132 



MYTHOLOGY 



ways. The missionary is sometimes anxious to prove that religion 
can only come by revelation, and that certain tribes, having received 
no revelation, have no religion or religious myths at all. Sometimes 
the missionary, on the other hand, is anxious to demonstrate that 
the myths of his heathen flock are a corrupted version of the Biblical 
narrative. In the former case he neglects the study of savage 
myths; in the latter he unconsciously accommodates what he hears 
to what he calls " the truth." The traveller who is not a missionary 
may either have the same prejudices, or he may be a sceptic about 
revealed religion. In the latter case he is perhaps unconsciously 
moved to put burlesque versions of Biblical stories into the mouths 
of his native informants, or to represent the savages as ridiculing 
the Scriptural traditions which he communicates to them. Yet 
again we must remember that the leading questions of a European 
inquirer may furnish a savage with a thread on which to string 
answers which the questions themselves have suggested. " Have 
you ever had a great flood ? " " Yes " " Was any one saved ? " 
The question starts the invention of the savage on a deluge-myth, 
of which, perhaps, the idea has never before entered his mind. There 
still remain the difficulties of all conversation between civilized 
men and unsophisticated savages, the tendency to hoax, and other 
sources of error and confusion. By this time, too, almost every 
explorer of savage life is a theorist. He is a Spencerian, or a believer 
in the universal prevalence of the faith in an " All-Father," or he 
looks everywhere for gods who are " spirits of vegetation." In 
receiving this kind of evidence, ther, we need to know the character 
of our informant, his means of communicating with the heathen, 
his power of testing evidence, and his good faith. His testimony 
will have additional weight if supported by the " undesigned coin- 
cidences " of other evidence, ancient and modern. If Strabo and 
Herodotus and Pomponius Mela, for example, describe a custom, 
rite or strange notion in the Old World, and if mariners and mission- 
aries find the same notion or custom or rite in Polynesia or Australia 
or Kamchatka, we can scarcely doubt the truth of the reports. 
The evidence is best when given by ignorant men, who are astonished 
at meeting with an institution which ethnologists are familiar with 
in other parts of the world. 

Another method of obtaining evidence is by the comparative 
study of savage laws and institutions. Thus we find in Asia, Africa, 
America and Australia that the marriage laws of the lower races 
are connected with a belief in kinship or other relationship with 
animals. The evidence for this belief is thus entirely beyond sus- 
picion. We find, too, that political power, sway and social influence 
are^ based on the ideas of magic, of metamorphosis, and of the power 
which certain men possess to talk with the dead and to visit the 
abodes of death. All these ideas are the stuff of which myths are 
made, and the evidence of savage institutions, in every part of the 
world, proves that these ideas are the universal inheritance of 
savages. 

Savage men are like ourselves in curiosity and anxiety causas 
cognoscere return^ but with our curiosity they do not possess 
Savage ideas out powers of attention. They are as easily satisfied 
about the with an explanation of phenomena as they are eager 
World. £ p 0SSess an explanation. Inevitably they furnish 

themselves with their philosophy out of their scanty stock 
of acquired ideas, and these ideas and general conceptions 
seem almost imbecile to civilized men. Curiosity and 
credulity, then, are the characteristics of the savage intellect. 
When a phenomenon presents itself the savage requires an 
explanation, and that explanation he makes for himself, or 
receives from tradition, in the shape of a myth. The basis of 
these myths, which are just as much a part of early conjectural 
science as of early religion, is naturally the experience of the 
savage as construed by himself. Man's craving to know " the 
reason why " is already " among rude savages an intellectual 
appetite," and " even to the Australian scientific speculation 
has its germ in actual experience. ,,x How does he try to satisfy 
this craving? E. B. Tylor replies, "When the attention of 
a man in the myth-making stage of intellect is drawn to any 
phenomenon or custom which has to him no obvious reason, 
he invents and tells a story to account for it. " Against this 
statement it has been urged that men in the lower stages of 
culture are not curious, but take all phenomena for granted. If 
there were no direct evidence in favour of Tylor's opinion, it 
would be enough to point to the nature of savage myths them- 
selves. It is not arguing in a circle to point out that almost 
all of them are nothing more than explanations of intellectual 
difficulties, answers to the question, How came this or that 
phenomenon to be' what it is? Thus savage myths answer 
the questions — What was the origin of the world, and of men, 
and of beasts? How came the stars by their arrangement 
1 E. B. Tylor, Primitive Culture, i. 369 (1871). 



and movements? How are the motions of sun and moon to 
be accounted for? Why has this tree a red flower, and this 
bird a black mark on the tail? What was the origin of the 
tribal dances, or of this or -that law of custom or etiquette? 
Savage mythology, which is also savage science, has a reply 
to all these and all similar questions, and that reply is always 
found in the shape of a story. The answers cannot be accounted 
for without the previous existence of the questions. 

We have now shown how savages come'to have a mythology. 
It is their way of satisfying the early form of scientific curiosity, 
their way of realizing the world in which they move. But they 
frame their stories, necessarily and naturally, in harmony with 
their general theory of things, with what we may call " savage 
metaphysics." Now early man, as Max Miiller says, " not only 
did not think as we think, but did not think as we suppose he 
ought to have thought.'' The chief distinction between his 
mode of conceiving the world and ours is his vast extension of 
the theory of personality. To the savage, and apparently to men 
more backward than the most backward peoples we know, all 
nature was a congeries of animated personalities. The savage's 
notion of personality is more a universally diffused feeling than 
a reasoned conception, and this feeling of a personal self he 
impartially distributes all over the world as known to him. 
One of the Jesuit missionaries in North America thus describes 
the Red Man's philosophy: 2 " Les sauvages se persuadent que 
non seulement les hommes et les autres animaux, mais aussi 
que toutes les autres choses sont anim6es." Crevaux, in the 
Andes, found that the Indians believed that the beasts have 
piays (sorcerers and doctors) like themselves. 5 This opinion 
we may name personalism, and it is the necessary condition 
of savage (and, as will be seen, of civilized) mythology. The 
Jesuits could not understand how spherical bodies like sun 
and moon could be mistaken for human beings. Their catechu- 
mens put them off with the answer that the drawn bows of the 
heavenly bodies gave them" their round appearance. " The 
wind was formerly a person; he became a bird," say the Bushmen, 
and gf do ka! kai y a respectable Bushman once saw the personal 
wind at Haarfontein. 4 The Egyptians; according to Herodotus 
(iii. 16), believed fire to be Sypiov ejjyfvxov, a live beast. The 
Bushman who saw the Wind meant to throw a stone at it, but 
it ran into a hill. From the wind as a person the Bhinyas in 
India (Dalton, p. 140) claim descent, and in Indian epic tradition 
the leader of the ape army was the son of the wind. The 
Wind, by certain mares, became the father of wind-swift steeds 
mentioned in the Iliad. The loves of Boreas are well known. 
These are examples of the animistic theory applied to what, in 
our minds, seems one of the least personal of natural phenomena. 
The sky (which appears to us even less personal) has been re- 
garded as a personal being by Samoyeds, Red Indians, Zulus, 5 
and traces of this belief survive in Chinese, Greek and Roman 
religion. 

We must remember, however, that to the savage, Sky, Sun, 
Sea, Wind, are not only persons, but they are savage persons. 
Their conduct is not what civilized men would attribute to 
characters so august; it is what uncivilized men think probable 
and befitting among beings like themselves. 

The savage regards all animals as endowed with personality. 
" lis tiennent les poissons raisonnables, comme aussi les cerfs," 
says a Jesuit father about the North-American ~ wvm 
Indians (Relations, loc. cit.). In Australia the Theory of 
natives believe that the wild dog has the power Man's Reia* 
of speech, like the cat of the Coverley witch in the JjJfJ^ 
Spectator. The Breton peasants, according to P. 
Sebillot, credit all birds with language, which they even attempt 
to interpret. The old English and the Arab superstitions 
about the language of beasts are examples of this opinion sur- 
viving among civilized races. The bear in Norway is regarded 
as almost a man, and his dead body is addressed and his wrath 
deprecated by Samoyeds and Red Indians. " The native bear

Kur-bo-roo is the .sage counsellor of the aborigines in all their 
difficulties. When bent on a dangerous expedition, the men 
will seek help from this clumsy creature, but in what way his 
opinions are made known is nowhere recorded." l H. R. School- 
craft mentions a Red Indian story explaining how " the bear 
does not die," but this tale Schoolcraft (like Herodotus in Egypt) 
" cannot bring himself to relate." He also gives examples of 
Iowas conversing with serpents. These may serve as examples 
of the savage belief in the human intelligence of animals. Man 
is on an even footing with them, and with them can interchange 
his ideas. But savages carry this opinion much further. Man 
in their view is actually, and in no figurative sense, akin to the 
beasts. Certain tribes in Java "believe that women when 
delivered of a child are frequently delivered at the same time 
of a young crocodile." 2 The common European story of a 
queen accused of giving birth to puppies shows the survival of 
the belief in the possibility of such births among civilized races, 
while the Aztecs had the idea that women who saw* the moon 
in certain circumstances would produce mice. But the chief 
evidence for the savage theory of man's close kinship with the 
lower animals is found in the institution called tolemism (q.v.) 
— the belief that certain stocks of men in the various tribes are 
descended by blood descent from, or are developed out of, or 
otherwise connected with, certain objects animate or inani- 
mate, but especially with beasts. The strength of the opinion is 
proved by its connexion with very stringent marriage laws. 
No man (according to the rigour of the custom) may marry a 
woman who bears the same kin name as himself, that is, who is 
descended from the same inanimate object or animal. Nor may 
people (if they can possibly avoid it) eat the flesh of animals who 
are their kindred. Savage man also believes that many of his 
own tribe-fellows have the power of assuming the shapes of 
animals, and that the souls of his dead kinsfolk revert to animal 
forms. 

E. W. Lane, in his introduction to the Arabian Nights (i. 58), 
says he found the belief in these transmigrations accepted seriously 
in Cairo. H. H. Bancroft brings evidence to prove that the Mexicans 
supposed^ pregnant women would turn into beasts, and sleeping 
children into mice, if things went wrong in the ritual of a certain 
solemn sacrifice. There is a well-known Scottish legend to the effect 
that a certain old witch was once fired at in her shape as a hare, 
and that where the hare was hit there the old woman was found to 
be wounded. J. F. Lafitau tells the same story as current among 
his Red Indian flock, except that the old witch and her son took the 
form of birds, not of hares. A Scandinavian witch does the same in 
the Egil saga. In Lafitau's tale the birds were wounded by the 
magic arrows of a medicine man, and the arrow-heads were found 
in the bodies of the human culprits. In Japan 3 people chiefly 
transform themselves into badgers. The sorcerers of Honduras 
(Bancroft, i. 740) " possessed the power of transforming men into 
wild beasts. " J. F. Regnard, the French dramatist, found in Lap- 
land (1681) that witches could turn men into cats, and could them- 
selves assume the forms of swans, crows, falcons and geese. Among 
the Bushmen* " sorcerers assume the form of beasts and jackals." 
M. Dobrizhofer, a missionary in Paraguay (1717-1791), learned that 
" sorcerers arrogate to themselves the power of changing men into 
tigers " (Eng. trans., i. 63). He was present at a conversion of this 
sort, a though the miracle beheld by the people was invisible to the 
missionary. Near Loanda Livingstone noted that " a chief may 
metamorphose himself into a lion, kill any one he chooses, and resume 
his proper form." The same accomplishments distinguish the Barotse 
ancf Balonda. 6 Among the Mayas of Central America sorcerers 
could transform themselves "into dogs, pigs and other animals; 
their glance was death to a victim (Bancroft, ii. 797). The 
Thlinkeets hold that their shamans have the same powers. 8 A 
bamboo in Sarawak is known to have been a man. Metamor- 
phoses into stones are as common among Red Indians and Australians 
as in Greek mythology. Compare the cases of Niobe and the victims 
of the Gorgon's head. 7 Zulus, Red Indians, Aztecs, 8 Andaman 
Islanders and other races believe that their dead assume the shapes 
of serpents and of other creatures, often reverting to the form of the 
animal from which they originally descended. In ancient Egypt

11 the usual prayers demand for the deceased the power of going and 
coming from and to everywhere under any form they like." 9 A 
trace of this opinion may be noticed in the Aeneid. The serpent 
that appeared at the sacrifice of Aeneas was regarded as possibly 
a " manifestation " of the soul of Anchises (Aeneid, v. 84) — 

" Dixerat haec, adytis quum lubricus anguis ab imis 
Septem ingens gyros, septena volumina, traxit," 
and Aeneas is 

11 Incertus, geniumne loci, famulumne parentis 
Esse putet." 
On the death of Plotinus, as he gave up the ghost, a snake glided from 
under his bed into a hole in the wall. 10 Compare Pliny " on the cave 
" in quo manes Scipionis Africani majoris custodire draco dicitur." 
The last peculiarity in savage philosophy to which we need call 
attention here is the belief in spirits and in human intercourse 
with the shades of the dead. With the savage natural death 
is not a universal and inevitable ordinance. " All men must 
die" is a generah'zation which he has scarcely reached; in his 
philosophy the proposition is more like this — " all men who die 
die by violence." A natural death is explained as the result of 
a sorcerer's spiritual violence, and the disease is attributed to 
magic or to the action of hostile spirits. After death the man 
survives as a spirit, sometimes taking an animal form, sometimes 
invisible, sometimes to be observed " in his habit as he lived " 
(see Apparitions). The philosophy of the subject is shortly 
put in the speech of Achilles (Iliad, xxiii. 103) after he has beheld 
the dead Patroclus in a dream: " Ay me, there remaineth then 
even in the house of Hades a spirit and phantom of the dead, for 
all night long hath the ghost of hapless Patroclus stood over me, 
wailing and making moan." It is almost superfluous to quote 
here the voluminous evidence for the intercourse with spirits 
which savage chiefs and medicine men are believed to maintain. 
They can call up ghosts, or can go to the ghosts, in Australia, 
New Caledonia, New Zealand, North America, Zululand, among 
the Eskimo, and generally in every quarter of the globe. The 
men who enjoy this power are the same as they who can change 
themselves and others into animals. They too command the 
weather, and, says an old French missionary, " are regarded as 
very Jupiters, having in their hands the b'ghtning and the 
thunder " (Relations, loc. ciL). They make good or bad seasons, 
and control the vast animals who, among ancient Persians and 
Aryans of India, as among Zulus and Iroquois, are supposed to 
grant or withhold the rain, and to thunder with their enormous 
wings in the region of the clouds. 

Another fertile source of myth is magic, especially the magic 
designed to produce fertility, vegetable and animal. From the 
natives of northern and central Australia to the actors in the 
ritual of Adonis, or the folk among whom arose the customs of 
crowning the May king or the king of the May, all peoples have 
done magic to encourage the breeding of animals as part of the 
food supply, and to stimulate the growth of plants, wild or 
cultivated. In the opinion of J. G. Frazer, the human repre- 
sentatives or animal representatives, in the rites, of the spirit 
of vegetation; of the corn spirit; of the changing seasons, winter 
or summer, have been developed into many forms of gods, 
with appropriate myths, explanatory of the magic, and of the 
sacrifice of the chief performer. In the same way the adoration 
of b'ving human beings, the deification of living kings — whose 
title survives in our king or queen of the May, and in the rex 
nemorensis, the priest of Diana in the grove of Aricia — has been 
most fruitful in myths of divine beings. These human beings 
are often sacrificed, for various reasons, actual or hypothetical, 
and god? and heroes are almost as likely to be explained as 
spirits of vegetation now, as they were likely to become solar 
mythological figures in the system of Max Miiller. It is certainly 
true that divine beings in most mythologies are apt to acquire 
solar with other elemental attributes, including vegetable 
attributes. But that the origins of such mythical beings were, 
ab initio, either solar or vegetable, or, for that matter, animal, 
it would often be hard to prove. 

Frazer's ideas are to be found in a work of immense erudition, 
The Golden Bough (London, 1900). Two studies by him, pursuing

MYTHOLOGY 



the same set of ideas in more detail, are Adonis, Attis, Osiris (1906) 
and Lectures on the Early History of the Kingship (1905). See A. 
Lang, Magic and Religion (London, 1901), for a criticism in detail 
of the general theory as set forth in The Golden Bough, Whatever 
may be said, Frazer has certainly made the most important of recent 
contributions to the study of mythology. # He has fixed the attention 
of students on a mass of early ideas, previously much neglected save 
by W. Mannhardt, and on the facts of ritual, which preserve these 
ideas and represent them in a kind of mystery plays. 

We are now in a position to sum up the ideas of savages about 
man's relations to the world. We started on this inquiry 
because we found that savages regarded sky, wind, sun, earth 
and so forth as practically men, and we had then to ask, what 
sort of men, men with what powers ? The result of our exam- 
ination, so far, is that in savage opinion sky, wind, sun, sea and 
many other phenomena have, being personal, all the powers 
attributed to real human persons. These powers and qualities 
are: (r) relationship to animals and ability to be transformed 
and to transform others into animals and other objects; (2) 
magical accomplishments, as — (a) power to visit or to procure 
the visits of the dead; (b) other magical powers, such as control 
over the weather and over the fertility of nature in all depart- 
ments. Once more, the great forces of nature, considered as 
persons, are involved in that inextricable confusion in which 
men, beasts, plants, stones, stars, are all on one level of person- 
ality and animated existence. This is the philosophy of savage 
life, and it is on these principles that the savage constructs his 
myths, while these, again, are all the scientific explanations of 
the universe with which he has been able to supply himself. 

Examples of Mythology. — Myths of the origin of the world 
and man are naturally most widely diffused. Man has every- 
where asked himself whence things came and how, and his 
myths are his earliest extant form of answer to this question. 
So confused and inconsistent are the mythical answers" that it 
is very difficult to classify them according to any system. If 
we try beginning with myths of creative gods, we find that the 
world is sometimes represented as pre-existent to the divine 
race. If we try beginning with myths of the origin of the world, 
we frequently find that it owes its origin to the activity of pre- 
existent supernatural beings. According to all modern views 
of creation, the creative mind is prior to the universe which it 
created. There is no such consistency of opinion in myths, 
whether of civilized or savage races. Perhaps the plan least open 
to objection is to begin with myths of the gods. But when we 
speak of gods, we must not give to the word a modern signifi- 
cance. As used here, gods merely mean non-natural and 
powerful beings, sometimes " magnified non-natural men," 
sometimes beasts, birds or insects, sometimes the larger forces 
and phenomena of the universe conceived of as endowed with 
human personality and passions. When Plutarch examined 
the Osirian myth (De Isid, xxv.) he saw that the " gods " in 
the tale were really " demons," " stronger than men, but 
having the divine part not wholly unalloyed " — "magnified non- 
natural men," in short. And such are the gods of mythology. 

In examining the myths of the gods we shall begin with the 
conceptions of the most backward tribes, and advance to the 
divine legends of the ancient civilized races. It will appear that, 
while the non-civilized gods are often theriomorphic, made in 
accordance with the ideas of non-civilized men, the civilized 
gods retain many characteristics of the savage gods, and these 
.characteristics are the " irrational element " in the divine myths. 

Myths of Gods: Savage Ideas. — It is not easy to separate the dis- 
cussion of savage myths of gods from the problem, Whence and how 
arose the savage belief in gods? The orthodox anthropological 
explanation has been that of E. B. Tylor, which closely resembles 
Herbert Spencer's " ghost theory." By reflection on dreams, in 
which the self, or " spirit," of the savage seems to wander free from 
the bounds of time and space, to see things remote, and to meet 
and recognize dead friends or foes ; by speculation on the experiences 
of trance and of phantasms of the dead or living, beheld with waking 
eyes; by pondering on the phenomena of shadows, of breath, of 
death and life, the savage evolved the idea of a separable soul or 
spirit capable of surviving bodily death. The spirit of the dead may 
tenant a material object, a " fetish," or may roam hungry and 
comfortless and need propitiation by food, for unpropitiated it is 
dangerous, or may be reincarnated, or may " go to its own herd " 



in another world. Again, it is naturally kind to its living kinsfolk, 
and so may be addressed in prayer. These are the doctrines of 
animism^ (q.v.), and, according to the usual anthropological theory, 
these spirits come to thrive to god's estate in favourable circum- 
stances, as where the dead man, when alive, had great mana or wakan, 
a great share of the ether, so to speak, which, in savage metaphysics, 
is the viewless vehicle of magical influences. Thus the ghost of the 
hero or medicine man .of a kin or tribe may be raised to divine rank, 
while again — the doctrine of spirits once developed, and spirits once 
allotted to the great elemental forces and phenomena of nature, sky, 
thunder, the sea, the forests — we have the beginnings of depart- 
mental deities, such as Agni, gpd of fire; Poseidon, god of the sea; 
Zeus, god of the sky — though in recent theories Zeus appears to be 
regarded as primarily the god of the oak tree, a spirit of vegetation. 

On this^ theory animism, s the doctrine of spirits, is the source of 
all belief in gods. But it is found that among the lowest or least 
cultured races, such as the south-eastern tribes of Australia, who 
do not propitiate ancestral spirits by offerings of food, or address 
them in prayer, there often exists a belief in an " All-Father," to 
use Howitt's convenient expression. This being cannot have been 
evolved out of the cult of ancestors, where ancestors are not wor- 
shipped; and he is not even regarded as a spirit, but, in Matthew 
Arnold's phrase, as " a magnified non-natural man." He existed 
before death came into the world, and he still exists. His home is in 
or above the sky, but there was a time when he walked the earth, a 
potent magic-worker; endowed mankind with such arts and institu- 
tions as they possess ;^ and left to them certain rules of life, ethics 
and ritual. Often he is regarded as the maker of things, or of most 
things, and of mankind; or mankind are his children, descended 
from disobedient sons of his, whom he cast out of heaven. Very 
frequently he is the judge of souls, and sends the good and bad to 
their own places of reward and punishment. He is usually^ supposed 
to watch over human conduct, but this is by no means invariably 
the case. Sometimes he, like the Atnatu of the Kaitish tribe of 
central Australia, is only vigilant in matters of ritual, such as cir- 
cumcision, subincision and the use of the sacred bull-roarer, the 
Greek £6ju£os. As an almost universal rule, in the lowest culture, 
no prayers are addressed to this being; he has no sacrifices, no dwell- 
ing made with hands; and the images of him, in clay, that are made 
and danced round with invocations of his name at the tribal cere- 
monies of initiation, are destroyed at the close of the performances. 
If the name of " gqd " is denied to such beings because they receive 
little cult, it may still be admitted that the belief might easily develop 
into a form of theism, independent of and underived from animism, 
or the ghost theory. 

The best account of this All-Father belief in the lowest culture is 
to be read in R. Howitt's Native Races of South-East Australia. Under 
the names of Baiamc, Pundjel, Mulkari, Daramulun 
and many others, the south-eastern tribes (both those Australian 
who reckon descent in the female and those who reckon Savages* 
by the male line) have this faith in an All-Father, the 
attributes varying in various communities. The most highly 
developed All-Father is the Baiame or Byamee of the Euahlayi 
tribe of north-western New South Wales, to whom prayers for the 
welfare of the souls of the dead are, or recently were, addressed — the 
tribe dwelling a hundred miles away from the nearest missionary 
station (Protestant). 1 

In the centre of Australia, Atnatu, self-created, is known, as has 
been said, to the Kaitish tribe, next neighbours of the Arunta of the 
Macdonnell Hills. Among the Arunta, Mr Strehlow (Globus, May 
1907) finds such a being as Atnatu, and also among some other 
adjacent tribes, as the Luritja. See, too, Strehlow and von Leon- 
hardi, in Veroffentlichungen aus dem stddtischen Vdlker- Museum 
(Frankfurt-am-Main, 1907, vol. i.). But Messrs B. Spencer and 
F. J. Gillen, who discovered Atnatu, did not find any trace of an 
All-Father among the Arunta, or any other of the tribes to the north 
and north-east of the centre. Mr Strehlow's branch of the Arunta 
they did not examine. 

It is plain that the All-Father belief , in favourable circumstances, 
especially if ghost worship remained undeveloped, might be evolved 
into theism. But all over the savage world, especially in Africa, 
spirit worship has sprung up and choked the All-Father, who, how- 
ever, in most savage regions, abides as a name, receiving no sacrifice, 
and, save amon^ the Masai, a seldom being addressed in prayer. 
A list of such otiose great beings in the background of religion is 
given in Lang's The Making of Religion (1808). Since the publica- 
tion of that book much additional evidence has accrued from Africa 
and Melanesia, where the belief occurs in a few islands, but, in the 
majority, is absent or unrecorded. Most of the fresh evidence is 
given in La Notion de VUre supreme chez les peuples non*civilises, 
by Rene" Hoffmann (Geneva, 1907). See also the Journal of the 
Anthropological Institute (1899-1907), vols, xxix., xxxii., xxxiv., 
xxxv., and the works of Miss Mary Kingsley, and Spieth, Die Ewe- 
Stamme. Reimer (Berlin, 1906), and Sundermann in Warneck's 
Allgemeine Missionszeilschrift, vol. xi. An excellent statement is that 
of Pere Schmidt, S.V.D., in Anthropos. Bd. III., Hft. 3 (1908), pp. 
559-611. Tylor's efforts to show that these All-Fathers were 
derived from missionary or other European influences (Nineteenth

Century, 1892) have not been successful (see Lang, Magic and Religion, 
" The Theory of Loan Gods ")and N.W.Thomas in Man (1905)^,49 
et seq. The All-Father belief is most potent among * the lowest 
races, and always tends to become obsolete under the competition 
of serviceable ancestral spirits, or gods made in the image of such 
spirits, who can be bribed by sacrifices or induced by prayers to help 
man in his various needs. 

The belief in the All-Father in south-eastern Australia is concealed 
from the women and children who, at most, know his exoteric 
name, often meaning " Our Father," and is revealed only to the 
initiate, among whom are a very few white men, like Howitt. Mrs 
Langloh Parker, of course, was not initiated (indeed, no white man 
has gone through the actual and very painful rites), but confidences 
were made to her with great secrecy. The All-Father, even at his 
best, among the Kurnai, Kamilaroi and Euahlayi, is the centre of 
many grotesque and sportive myths. He usually has a wifeand 
children, not in all cases born, but rather they are emanations. 
One of these children is often his mediator with men, and has the 
charge of the rites and the mystic bull-roarer. The relation is that 
of Apollo to Zeus in Greek myth. 

Many of the wilder myths are the expressions of the sportive and 
humorous faculties. Some arise naturally thus: Baiame, say, 
originated everything, therefore he originated the grotesque 
mummeries and dances of the mysteries. To explain these, myths 
have been developed to show that they arose in some grotesque 
incident of Baiame's personal existence on earth. Many Greek 
myths, most derogatory to the dignity of Demeter, Dionysus^ Zeus 
or Hera, arose in the same way, as explanations of buffooneries in 
the Eleusinian or other mysteries. In medieval literature the most 
sacred persons of our religion have grotesque associations attached 
to them in the same manner. 

While the All-Father belief is common in the tribes of south- 
eastern Australia, the tribes round Lake Eyre, the Arunta (as 
known to Messrs Spencer and Gillen), and the other central and 
northern tribes, are credited with no germs of belief in what is called 
a supreme, and may truly be styled a superior being. That being, 
in many cases, but not so commonly in Australia, has a malevolent 
opposite who thwarts his work, an Ahriman to his Ormuzd. In 
one district, where the superior being is a. crow, his opposite is an 
eagle-hawk. These two birds in many tribes give names to the two 
great exogamousand intermarrying divisions; in their case there is a 
va et vient of divine, human and theriomorphic elements, just as in 
the Greek myths of Zeus. As a rule, however, the Australian All- 
Father is anthropomorphic^ and fairly well described in the native 
term when they speak English as " the Big Man," powerful, death- 
Jess, friendly, * able to go everywhere and do everything," " to see 
whatever you do." The existence of the belief in this being was 
accepted by T. Waitz^ and, though disputed by many squatters and 
most anthropologists, is now admitted on the strength of the evidence 
of Howitt, Cameron, Mrs Langloh Parker, Dawson, W. E. Roth in 
Ethnological Studies, and many other close observers. The belief 
being esoteric, a secret of the initiated, necessarily escaped casual 
inquirers. 

Meanwhile, among some of the Arunta of the centre, among the 
Dieri and Urabunna tribes near Lake Eyre and their congeners, 
and among the tribes north by east of the Arunta, no such belief 
has been discovered by Messrs Spencer and Gillen, from whom the 
tribes kept no secrets, or by Mr Siebert, a missionary among the now 
aH but extinct Dieri. ^ There is just a trace of a dim sky-dwelling 
being, Arawotja, possibly an all but obliterated survival of an All- 
Father. Howitt speaks too of the Dieri Kutchi, who inspires 
medicine-men with ideas, but about him our information is scanty. 
Among all these tribes religion now takes another line, the belief 
in a supernormal race of Titanic beings, with no superior, who were 
the first dwellers on earth ; who possessed powers far exceeding those 
of the medicine-men of to-day; and who, in one way or another, 
were connected with, or developed from, the totem animals.vege- 
tables and other objects. These beings modified the face of the 
country; in Arunta belief rocks and trees arose to mark the places 
where they finally " went into the ground " (Oknanikilla), and their 
spirits still haunt certain places such as these; and are reincarnated 
in native women who pass by. These beings, in Arunta called 
" the people of the Alcheringa, or dream time " (but cf. Strehlow 
in Globus, ut supra), originated the tribal rites of initiation. In 
Dieri they are called Mura-Mura, and to them prayers are made for 
rain, accompanied by rain-making magic ceremonies, which in this 
case may be a symbolical expression of the prayers. There is a 
large body of myths about the Alcheringa folk, or Mura-Mura 
(see Spencer and Gillen, Native Tribes of Central Australia, Native 
Tribes of Northern Australia, and Howitt, Native Tribes of South- 
Eastern Australia), and the myths of their wanderings, prodigies 
and institution of rites and magic are represented in the dances of 
the mysteries. Most of the magic is worked (Intichiuma in Arunta) 
by the members of each totem kin or group for the behoof of the 
totem as an article of food supply. These rites are common in 
North America, but are worked, by members of gilds or societies, 
not by totern kins. 
- The belief in these Mura-Mura or Alcheringa folk may obviously 
develop, in favourable circumstances, into a polytheism like that of 
Greece, or of Egypt, or of the Maoris. The old Irish gods in the 



poetic romances appear to have the same origin and shade away 
into the fairies. The baser Greek myths of the wanderings, 
amours and adventures of the gods, myths ignored by Homer, are 
parallel to t£e adventures of the Alcheringa people, and the fable of 
the mutilation of Osiris and the search for the lost organ by I sis, 
actually occurs among the Alcheringa tales of Messrs Spencer and 
Gillen. Among the Arunta, the Alcheringa folk are part of a 
strangely elaborate theory of evolution and of animism, which leaves 
no room for a creative being, or for a future life of the spirit, which 
is merely reincarnated at intervals. 

Thus the doctrines of evolution and of creation, or the making of 
things, stand apart, or blend, in the metaphysics and religion of the 
lowest and least progressive of known peoples. The question as to 
which theory came first, whether Alcheringaism is a scientific 
effort that swept away All-Fatherism, or whether All-Fa therism is 
a religious reaction in despair of science and of the evolutionary 
doctrine, is settled by each inquirer in accordance with his personal 
bias. It has been argued that All-Fatherism is an advance, con- 
ditioned by coastal influences — more rain and more food — con- 
comitant with a social advance to individual marriage, and reckon- 
ing of kin in the male line. But tribes far from the sea, as in northern 
New South Wales and Queensland, have the All-Father belief, with 
individual marriage and; female descent, while tribes of the north 
coast, with male descent, are credited with no All-Father; and the 
Arunta, as far as possible from the sea, have no All-Father (save in 
Strehlow's district) , and have individual marriage and male reckon- 
ing of descent in matters of inheritance; while the Urabunna and 
Dieri, with female descent and the custom of pirrauru (called 4 * group 
marriage " by Howitt), are not credited with the All-Father belief. 
Thus coastal conditions have clearly no causal influence on the 
development of the All-Father belief'. If they had, the natives of 
central Queensland, remote from the sea, should not have their 
All-Father (Mulkari), and the natives of the northern and north- 
eastern coasts should have an All-Father, who is still to seek. The 
Arunta of Messrs Spencer and Gillen may have possessed and deposed 
the Altjira superior being of the Arunta known to Mr Strehlow, 
like the Atnatu of the adjacent Kaitish, or the All-Father of the 
neighbouring Luritja; or these beings may be more recent diver- 
gences of doctrine, departures from pure Alcheringaism with no All- 
Father. At present, at least, it is premature to dogmatize on these 
problems. 1 

The chief being among the supernatural characters of Bushman 
mythology is the^ insect called the Mantis.* Cagn or Ikaggen, the 
Mantis, is sometimes regarded with religious respect as 
a benevolent god. But his adventures are the merest **"&*** 
nightmares of puerile fancy. He has a wife, an adopted *> aY *& s * 
daughter, whose real father is the " swallower " in Bushman swallow- 
ing myths, and the daughter has a son, who is the Ichneumon. 
The Mantis made an eland out of the shoe of his son-in-law. The 
moon was also created by the Mantis out of his shoe, and it is red, 
because the shoe was covered with the red dust of Bushman-land. 
The Mantis is defeated in an encounter with a cat which happened 
to be singing a song about a lynx. The Mantis (like Poseidon, 
Hades, Metis and other Greek gods)was once swallowed, but dis- 
gorged alive. The swallower was the monster I lkhwai-hemm. 
Like Heracles when he leaped into the belly of the monster which 
was about to swallow Hesione, the Mantis once jumped down the 
throat of a hostile elephant, and so destroyed him. The heavenly 
bodies are gods among the Bushmen, but their nature and adventures 
must be discussed among other myths of sun, moon and stars. As 
a creator Cagn is sometimes said to have " given orders, and caused 
all things to appear to be made." He struck snakes with his staff 
and turned them into men, as Zeus did with the ants in Aegina. 
But the Bushmen's mythical theory of the origin of things must, 
as far as possible, be kept apart from the fables of the Mantis, the 
Ichneumon and other divine beings. Though animals, these gods 
have human passions and character, and possess the usual magical 
powers attributed to sorcerers. 

Concerning the mythology of the Hottentots and Namas, we have 
a great deal of information in a book named Tsuni-Goam, the Supreme 
Being of the Khoi-Khoi (i88i),by DrT. Hahn. This author collected 
the old notices of Hottentot myths, and added material from his 
own researches. The chief god of the Hottentots is a being named 
Tsuni-Goam, who is universally regarded by his worshippers as a 
deceased sorcerer. According to one old believer, " Tsui-Goab " 
(an alternative reading of the god's name) *' was a great powerful 
chief of the Khoi-Khoi— in fact, he was the first Khoi-Khoib from 
whom all the Khoi-Khoi tribes took their name." He is always 



1 The drawback to knowledge is the rarity of full acquaintance 
with native languages. Strehlow, Roth and Ridley seem best 
equipped on the linguistic side. Spencer and Gillen do not tell us 
that they have a colloquial knowledge of any Australian language. 
Gason, author of a work on the Dieri tribe, knew their language 
well, but several of his statements appear to be inaccurate. Mrs 
Langloh Parker describes her methods of checking and controlling 
native statements made in English.

MYTHOLOGY 



represented as at war (in the usual crude dualism of savages) with 
" another chief " named Gaunab. The prayers addressed to Tsui- 
Goab are simple and natural in character, the " private ejaculations " 
of men in moments of need or distress. As usual, religion is more 
advanced than mythology. It appears that, by some accounts, 
Tsui-Goab lives in the red sky and Gaunab in the dark sky. The 
neighbouring race of Namas have another old chief for god, a being 
called Heitsi Eibib. His graves are shown in many places, like those 
of Osiris, which, says Plutarch, abounded in Egypt. He is propi- 
tiated by passers-by at his sepulchres. He has intimate relations 
in peace and war with a variety of animals whose habits are some- 
times explained (like those of the serpent in Genesis) as the result 
of the curse of Heitsi Eibib. Heitsi Eibib was born in a mysterious 
way from a cow, as Indra in the Black Yajvr- Veda entered into and 
was born from the womb of a being who also bore a cow. The 
Rig-Veda (iv. 18, 1) remarks, " His mother, a cow, bore Indra, an 
unlicked calf " — probably a metaphorical way of speaking. Heitsi 
Eibib, like countless other gods and heroes, is also said to have been 
the son of a virgin who tasted a particular plant, and so became 
pregnant, as in the German and Gallophrygian marchen of the 
almond tree, given by Grimm and Pausanias. Incest is one of the 
feats of Heitsi Eibib. Tsui-Goab, in the opinion of his worshippers, 
as we have seen, is a deified dead sorcerer, whose name means 
Wounded Knee, the sorcerer having been injured in the knee by an 
enemy. Dr Hahn tries to prove (by philology's " artful aid ") 
that the name really means " red dawn," and is a Hottentot way of 
speaking of the infinite. The philological arguments advanced 
are extremely weak, and by no means convincing. If we grant, 
however, for the sake of argument, that the early Hottentots wor- 
shipped the infinite under the figure of the dawn, and that, by for- 
getting their own meaning, they came to believe that the words 
which really meant " red dawn" meant " wounded knee " we must 
still admit that the devout have assigned to their deity all the attri- 
butes of an ancestral sorcerer. In short, " their Red Dawn," if 
red dawn he be, is a person, and a savage person, adored exactly as 
the actual fathers and grandfathers of the Hottentots are adored. 
We must explain this legend, then, on these principles, and not as an 
allegory of the dawn as the dawn appears to civilized people. About 
Gaunab (the Ahriman to Tsui-Goab's Ormuzd) Dr Hahn gives two 
distinct opinions. " Gaunab was at first a ghost, a mischief-maker 
and evil-doer " (op. cit. p. 85). But Gaunab he declares to be 
" the night-sky " (p. 126). Whether we regard Gaunab, t Heitsi 
Eibib and Tsui-Goab as originally mythological representations of 
natural phenomena, or as deified dead men, it is plain' that they are 
now venerated as non-natural human beings, possessing the custom- 
ary attributes of sorcerers. Thus of Tsui-Goab it is said, " He could 
do wonderful things which no other man could do, because he was 
very wise. He could tell what would happen in future times. 
He died several times, and several times he rose again n (statement 
of old Kxarab in Hahn, p. 61). 

The mythology of the Zulus as reported by H.Callaway (Unkulun- 
kulu, 1 868-1 870) is very thin and uninteresting. The Zulus are 
great worshippers of ancestors^ (who appear to men in the form of 
snakes), and they regard a being called Unkulunkulu as their first 
ancestor, and sometimes as the creator, or at least as the maker of 
men. It does not appear they identify Unkulunkulu, as a rule, 
with " the lord of heaven," who, like Indra, causes the thunder. 
The word answering to our lord is also applied," even to beasts, 
as the lion and the boa." The Zulus, like many distant races, 
sometimes attribute thunder to the " thunder-bird/' which, as in 
North America, is occasionally seen and even killed by men. " It 
is said to have a red bill, red legs and a short red tail like fire. The 
bird is boiled for the sake of the fat, which is used by the heaven- 
doctors to puff on their bodies, and to anoint their lightning-rods." 
The Zulus are so absorbed in propitiating the shades of their dead 
(who, though in serpentine bodies, have human dispositions) that 
they appear to take little pleasure in mythological narratives. At 
the same time, the Zulus have many " nursery tales," the plots and 
incidents of which often bear the closest resemblance to the heroic 
myths of Greece, and to the marchen of European peoples. 1 These 
indications will give a general idea of African divine myths. On 
the west coast the " ananzi " or spider takes the place of the mantis 
insect among the Bushmen. For some of his exploits Dasent's Tales 
from the Norse (2nd ed., Appendix) may be^ consulted. For South 
African' religion see Lang. Magic and Religion; Dennett, At the 
« Back of the Black Man's Mind; Junod, Les Barotsa; Spieth, Die 
Ewe-Stomme; Frazer, The Golden Bough.

Banks Islands are chiefly ancestor-worshippers, but they also believe 
in, and occasionally pray to, a being named I Qat, one of the prehuman 
race endowed with supernatural powers who here, as elsewhere, do 
duty as gods. Here is an example of a prayer to Qat — the devotee 
is supposed to be in danger with his canoe: " Qate! Marawa! look 
down on me, smooth the sea for us two that 1 may go safely on the sea. 
Beat down for me the crests of the tide-rip; let the tide-rip settle 
down away from me, beat it down level that it may sink and roll 
away, and I may come to a quiet landing-place." Compare the 
prayer of Odysseus to the river, whose mouth he had reached after 
three days' swimming on the tempestuous sea. *' ' Hear me, 
O king, whosoever thou art, unto thee I am come as to one to whom 
prayer is made . . . nay, pity me, O king, for I avow myself thy 
suppliant.' So spake he, and the god stayed his stream, and with- 
held his waves, and made the water smooth before him " (Odyssey 
v. 450). The prayer of the Melanesian is on rather a higher religious 
level than that of the Homeric hero. The myths of Qat's adventures, 
however, are very crude, though not so wild as some of the Scan- 
dinavian myths about Odin and Loki, while they are less immoral 
than the adventures of Indra and Zeus. Qat was born in the isle 
of Vanua Levu; his mother was either a stone at the time of his 
birth, or was turned into a stone afterwards, like Niobe. The mother 
of Apollo, according to Aelian, had the misfortune to be changed 
into a wolf. Qat had eleven brothers, not much more reputable 
than the Osbaldistones in Rob Roy. The youngest brother was 
" Tangaro Loloqong, the Fool." His pastime was to make wrong 
all that Qat made right, and he is sometimes the Ahriman to Qat's 
Ormuzd. The creative achievements of Qat must be treated of in 
the next section. Here it may be mentioned that, like the hero 
in the Breton marchen, Qat " brought the dawn " by introducing 
birds whose notes proclaimed the coming of morning. Before 
Qat's time there had been no night, but he purchased a sufficient 
allowance of darkness from I Qong, that is, night considered as a 
person in accordance with the law of savage thought already ex- 
plained. Night is a person in Greek mythology, and in the four- 
teenth book of the Iliad we read that Zeus abstained from punishing 
Sleep 4< because he feared to offend swift Night." Qat produced 
dawn, for the first time, by cutting the darkness with a knife of red 
obsidian. Afterwards " the fowls and birds showed the morning." 
On one occasion an evil power (Vui) slew all Qat's brothers, and 
hid them in a food-chest. As in the common " swallowing-myths " 
which we have met among bushmen and Australians, and will find 
among the Greeks, Qat restored his brethren to life. Qat is always 
accompanied by a powerful supernatural spider named Marawa. 
He first made Marawa's acquaintance when he was cutting down 
a tree for a canoe. Every night (as in the common European story, 
about bridge-building and church-building) the work was all undone 
by Marawa, whom Qat found means to conciliate. In all his future 
adventures the spider was as serviceable as the cat in Puss in Boots 
or the other grateful animals in European legend. Qat's great 
enemy, Qasavara, was dashed against the hard sky, and was turned 
into stone, like the foes of Perseus. The stone is still shown in Vanua 
Levu, like the stone which was Zeus in Laconia. Qat, like so many 
other " culture-heroes," disappeared mysteriously, and white men 
arriving in the island have been mistaken for Qat. His departure ■ 
is sometimes connected with the myth of the deluge. In the New 
Hebrides, Tagar takes the r61e of Qat, and Suqe of the bad principle, 
Loki, Ahriman, Tangaro Loloqong, the Australian Crow and so 
forth. These are the best known divine myths of the Melanesians. 
For their All-Fathers see Holmes, /. A. I., vol. xxxv., and O'Farrell,

It is " a far cry " from Vanua Levu to Vancouver Island, and, 
ethnologically, the Ahts of the latter region are extremely remote 
from the Papuans with their mixture of Malay and American 
Polynesian blood. The Ahts, however, differ but little savages. 
in their mythological beliefs from the races of the Banks 
Islands or of the New Hebrides. In Sproat's Scenes from Savage 
Life (1868) there is a good account ofAht opinions by a settler who 
had won the confidence of the natives between i860 and 1868. 
11 There is no end to the stories which an old Indian will relate," says 
Mr Sproat, when " one quite possesses his confidence." "The first 
Indian who ever lived " is a divine being, something of a creator, 
something of a first father, like Unkulunkulu among the Zulus. 
His name is Quawteaht. He married a pre-existent bird, the thunder- 
bird Tootah (we have met him among the Zulus), and by the 
bird he became the father of Indians. Wispohahp is the Aht 
Noah, who, with his wife, his two brothers and their wives escaped 
from the deluge in a canoe. Quawteaht is inferior as a deity to the 
Sun and Moon. He is the Yama of an Aht paradise, or home of the 
dead, where " everything is beautiful and abundant." From all 
that is told of Quawteaht he seems to be an ideal and powerful Aht, 
imaginatively placed at the beginning of things, and quite capable 
of intermarriage with a bird. His creative exploits must be con- 
sidered later. Quawteaht is the Aht Prometheus Purphoros, or 
fire-stealer. 

Passing down the American continent from the north-west, we 
find Yehf the chief hero-god and mythical personage among the 
Tlingits. Like many other heroes or gods, Yehl had a miraculous 
birth. His mother, a Tlingit woman, whose sons had all been 



MYTHOLOGY

slain, met a friendly dolphin, which advised her to swallow a pebble 
and a little sea-water. The birth of Yehl was the result. In his 
youth he shot a supernatural crane, and can always fly about in its 
feathers, like Odin and Loki in Scandinavian myth, He is usually, 
however, regarded as a raven, and holds the same relation to men 
and the world as the eagle-hawk Pund-jel does in Australia. His 
great opponent (for the eternal dualism comes in) is Khanukh, who 
is a wolf, and the ancestor or totem of the wolf-race of men as Yehl 
is of the raven. The opposition between the Crow and Eagle-hawk 
in Australia will be remembered. Both animals or men or gods 
take part in creation. Yehl is the Prometheus Purphoros of the 
Tlingxts, but myths of the fire-stealer would form matter for a 
separate section. Yehl also stole water, in his bird-shape, exactly 
as Odin stole " Suttung's mead " when in the shape of an eagle. 1 
Yehl's powers of metamorphosis and of flying into the air are the 
common accomplishments of sorcerers, and he is a rather crude form 
of first father, culture-hero " and creator. 1 

Among the Karok Indians we find the great hero and divine 
benefactor in the shape of, not a raven, nor an eagle-hawk, nor a 
mantis insect, nor a spider, but a coyote. Among both Karok 
and Navaho the coyote is the Prometheus Purphoros, or, as the 
Aryans of India calf him, Matarisvan the fire-stealer. Among the 
Papagos, on the eastern side of the Gulf of California, the coyote or 
prairie wolf is the creative hero and chief supernatural being. In 
Oregon the coyote fs also the " demiurge," but most of the myths 
about him refer to his creative exploits, and will be more appro- 
priately treated in the next section. 

Moving up the Pacific coast to British Columbia, we find the 
musk-rat taking the part played by Vishnu, when in his avatar as a 
boar he fished up the earth from the waters. Among the Tinneh a 
miraculous dog, who, like an enchanted fairy prince, could assume 
the form of a handsome young man, is the chief divine being of the 
myths. He too is chiefly a creative or demiurgic being, answering 
to Purusha in the Rig Veda, So far the peculiar mark of the wilder 
American tribe legends is the bestial character of the divine beings, 
which is also illustrated in Australia and Africa, while the bestial 
clothing, feathers or fur, drops but slowly off Indra, Zeus and the 
Egyptian Ammon, and the Scandinavian Odin. All these are more 
or less anthropomorphic, but retain, as will be seen, numerous relics 
of a theriomorphic condition.

Maori and^ Polynesian Beliefs. — Passing from the lower savage 
myths, of which space does not permit us to offer a larger selection, 
we turn to races in the upper strata of barbarism. Among these 
the Maoris of New Zealand, and the Polynesian people generally, 
are remarkable for a mythology largely intermixed with early 
attempts at more philosophical speculation. The Maoris and 
Mangaians, and other peoples, have had speculators among them 
not very far removed from the mental condition of the earliest Greek 
philosophers, Empedocles, Anaximander, and the rest. In fact the 
process from the view of nature which we call personalism to the 
crudest theories of the physicists was apparently begun in New 
Zealand before the arrival of Europeans. In Maori mythology it 
is more than usually difficult to keep apart the origin of the world 
and the origin and nature of the gods. Long traditional hymns give 
an account of the " becoming out of nothing " which resulted in 
the evolution of the gods and the world. In the beginning (as in the 
Greek myths of Uranus and Gaea), Heaven (Rangi, conceived of as 
a person) was indissolubly united to his wife Earth (Papa), and be- 
tween them they begat gods which necessarily dwelt in darkness. 
These^ gods were some in vegetable, some in animal form ; some 
traditions place among these gods Tiki the demiurge, who (like 
Prometheus^ made men out of clay. The offspring of Rangi and 
Papa (kept in the dark as they were) held a council to determine 
how they should treat their parents, " Shall we slay them, or shall 
we separate them?" In the # Hesiodic fable, Cronus separates 
the heavenly pair by mutilating his oppressive father Uranus. 
Among the Maoris the god Tutenganahan cut the sinews which 
united Earth and Heaven, and Tane Mahuta wrenched them apart, 
and kept them eternally asunder. The new dynasty now had 
earth to themselves, but Tawhiramatea, the wind, abode aloft with 
his father. Some of the gods were in the forms of lizards and fishes ; 
some went to the land, some to the water. As among the gods 
and Asuras of the Vedas, there were many wars in the divine race, 
and as the incantations of the Indian Brahmanas are derived from 
those old experiences of the Vedic gods, so are the incantations of 
the Maoris. The gods of New Zealand, the greater gods at least, 
may be called " departmental "; each person who is an elementary 
force is also the god of that force. As Te Heu, a powerful chief, 
said, there is division of labour among men, and so there is among 
gods. " One made this, another that; Tane made trees, Ru moun- 
tains, Tanga-roa fish, and so forth." * The " departmental " 
arrangement prevails among the polytheism of civilized peoples,

and is familiar to all from the Greek examples. Leaving the high 
gods whose functions are so large, while their forms (as of lizard, 
fish and tree) are often so mean, we come to Maui, the great divine 
hero of the supernatural race in Polynesia. Maui in some respects 
answers to the chief of the Adityas in Vedic mythology ; in others he 
answers to Qat, Quawteaht, and other savage divine personages. 
Like the son of the Vedic Aditi, 4 Maui is a rejected and abortive 
child of his mother, but afterwards attains to the highest reputation. 
As Qat brought the hitherto unknown night, so Maui settled the sun 
and moon in their proper courses. He induced the sun to move 
orderly by giving him a violent beating. A similar feat was per- 
formed by the Sun-trapper, a famous Red Indian chief. These 
tales belong properly to the department of solar myths. Maui him- 
self is thought by E. B. Tylor to be a myth of the sun, but the sun 
could hardly give the sun a drubbing. Maui slew monsters, invented 
barbs for fish-hooks, frequently adopted the form of various birds, 
acted as Prometheus Purphoros the fire-stealer, drew a whole island 
up from the bottom of the deep ; he was a great sorcerer and magician. 
Had Maui succeeded in his attempt to pass through the body of 
Night (considered as a woman) men would have been immortal. 
But a little bird which sings at sunset wakened Night, she snapped up 
Maui, and men die. This has been called a myth of sunset, but the 
sun does what Maui failed to do, he passes through the body of Night 
unharmed. The adventure is one of the myths of the origin of 
death, which are almost universally diffused. Maui, though regarded 
as a god, is not often addressed in prayer. 5 

The whole system, as far as it can be called a system, of Maori 
mythology is obviously based on the savage conceptions of the 
world which have already been explained. The Polynesian system 
differs mainly in detail; we have the separation of heaven and earth, 
the animal-shaped gods, the fire-stealing, the exploits of Maui, and 
scores of^ minor myths in \V. W. Gill's Myths and Songs of the South 
Pacific, in the researches of W. Ellis, of Williams, in G. Turner's 
Polynesia, and in many other accessible works. 

Mexican and Perwnan Beliefs. — The Maoris and other Polynesian 
peoples are perhaps the best examples of a race which has risen far 
above the savagery of Bushmen and Australians, but has not yet 
arrived at the stage in which great centralized monarchies appear. 
The Mexican and Peruvian civilizations were far ahead of Maori 
culture, in so far as they possessed the elements of a much more 
settled and highly-organized society- Their religion had its fine 
lucid intervals, but their mythology and ritual were little better 
than savage ideas, elaborately worked up by the imagination of a 
cruel and superstitious priesthood. In cruelty the Aztecs surpassed 
perhaps all peoples of the Old World, except certain Semitic stocks, 
and their gods, of course, surpassed almost all other gods in blood- 
thirstiness. But in grotesque and savage points of faith the ancient 
Egyptians, the Greeks, and the Vedic Indians ran even the Aztecs 
pretty close. 

Bernal Diaz, the old " conquistador," has described the hideous 
aspect of the idols which Cortes destroyed, " idols in the shape of 
hideous dragons as big as calves," idols half in the form of men, 
half of dogs, and serpents which were worshipped as divine. The 
old contemporary missionary Sahagun has left one of the earliest 
detailed accounts of the natures and myths of these gods, but, though 
Sahagun took great pains in collecting facts, his speculations must 
be accepted with caution. He was convinced (like Caxton in his 
Destruction of Troy, and like St Augustine) that the heathen gods 
were only dead men worshipped. Ancestor-worship is a great force 
in early religion, and the qualities of dead chiefs and sorcerers are 
freely attributed to gods, but it does not follow that each god was 
once a real man, as Sahagun supposes. Euemerism cannot be 
judiciously carried so far as this. Of Huitzilopochtli, the famed 
god, Sahagun says that he was a necromancer, loved " shape- 
shifting," like Odin, metamorphosed himself into animal forms, was 
miraculously conceived, and, among animals, is confused with the 
humming-bird, whose feathers adorned his statues."* This hum- 
ming-bird god should be compared with the Roman Picus (Servius, 
189). That the humming-bird (Nuitziton), which was the god's 
old shape, should become merely his attendant (like the owl of Pallas, 
the mouse of Apollo, the goose of Priapus, the cuckoo of Hera), when 
the god received anthropomorphic form, is an example of a process 
common in all mythologies. Plutarch observes that the Greeks, 
though accustomed to the conceptions of the animal attendants 
of their own gods, were amazed when they found animals worshipped 
as gods by the Egyptians. Mtiller 7 mentions the view that the 
humming-bird, as the most beautiful flying thing, is a proper symbol 
of the heaven, and so of the heaven-god, Huitzilopochtli. This 
vein of symbolism is so easy to work that it must be regarded with 
distrust. Perhaps it is safer to attribute theriomorphic shapes of 

* Rip Veda, x. 72, 1, 8; Muir, Sanskrit Texts, iv. 13, where the fable 
from the Satapatha-Brahmana is given. 

6 The best authorities for the New Zealand myths are the old 
traditional priestly hymns, collected and translated in the works of 
Sir George Grey, in Taylor's New Zealand, in Shortland's Traditions 
of New Zealand (1857), in Bastian's Heiliqe Sage der Polynesicr, and 
in White's Ancient History of the Maori, 1. 8-13.

MYTHOLOGY 



gods, not to symbolism (Zeus was a cuckoo), but to survivals from 
that quality of early thought which draws no line between man and 
god and beast and bird and fish. If spiders may be great gods, why 
not the more attractive humming-birds ? Like many other gods, 
Huitzilopochtli slew his foes at his birth, and hence received names 
analogous to AttfiSs and *6j8os: Tylor (Primitive Culture, ii. 
307) calls Huitzilopochtli an " inextricable compound partheno- 
gcnetic god." His sacrament, when paste idols 01 him were eaten 
by the communicants, was at the winter solstice, whence it may, 
perhaps, be inferred that Huitzilopochtli was not only a war-god 
but a nature-god — in both respects anthropomorphic, and in both 
bearing traces of the time when he was but a humming-bird, as Yehl 
was a raven (Miiller, op. ciU p. 595). As a humming-bird, Huitzilo- 
pochtli led the Aztecs to a new home, as a wolf led the Hirpini, and 
as a woodpecker led the Sabines. Quetzalcoatl, theToltec deity, 
is as much a sparrow (or similar small bird) as Huitzilopochtli is a 
humming-bird. Acosta says he retained the sparrow's head in his 
statue. For the composite character of Quetzalcoatl as a "culture- 
hero " (a more polished version of Qat), asa " nature-god," and 
as a theriomorphic god see Miiller (op. cit. pp. 583-584). Miiller 
frankly recognizes that not only are animals symbols of deity and 
its attributes, not only are they companions and messengers of deity 
(as in the period of anthropomorphic religion), but they have been 
divine beings in and for themselves during the earlier stages of 
thought. The Mexican " departmental " gods answer to those of 
other polytheisms; there is an Aztec Ceres, an Aztec Lucina, an 
Aztec Vulcan, an Aztec Flora, an Aztec Venus. The creative myths 
and sun myths are crude and very early in character. 

Egyptian Myths. — On a much larger and more magnificent scale, 
and on a much more permanent basis, the society of ancient Egypt 
somewhat resembled that of ancient Mexico. The divine myths of 
the two nations had points in common, but there are few topics 
more obscure than Egyptian mythology. Writers are apt to speak 
of Egyptian religion as if it were a single phenomenon of which all 
the aspects could be observed at a given time. In point of fact 
Egyptian religion (conservative though it was) lasted through per- 
haps five thousand years, was subject to innumerable influences, 
historical, ethnological, philosophical, and was variously represented 
by various schools of priests. We cannot take the Platonic specula- 
tions of Iamblichus about the nature and manifestations of Egyptian 
godhead as evidence for the belief of the peoples who first worshipped 
the Egyptian gods an innumerable series of ages before Iamblichus 
and Plutarch. ^ Nor can_ the esoteric and pantheistic theories of 
priests (according to which the various beast-gods were symbolic 
manifestations of the divine essence) be received as an historical 
account of the origin of the local animal-worships. It has already 
been shown that the lowest and least intellectual races indulge in 
local animal-worship, each stock having its parent bird, beast, fish, 
or even plant, or inanimate object. It has also been shown that 
these backward peoples recognize a non-natural race of men or 
animals, or both, as the first fathers, heroes, and, in a sense, gods. 
Such ideas are consonant with, and may be traced to the confused 
and nebulous condition of, savage thought. Precisely the same 
ideas are found at various periods among the ancient Egyptians. 
If we are to regard the Egyptian myths about the gods in animal 
shape, and about the non-natural superhuman heroes, and their 
wars and loves, as esoteric allegories devised by civilized priests, 
perhaps we should also explain Pund-jel, Qat, Quawteaht, the Mantis 
£od, the Spider creator, the Coyote and Raven gods as priestly 
inventions, put forth in a civilized age, and retained by Australians, 
Bushmen, Hottentots, Ahts, Thlinkeets, Papuans, who preserve 
no other vestiges of high civilization. Or we may take the opposite 
view, and regard the story of Osiris and his war with Seth (who shut 
him up in a box and mutilated him) as a dualistic myth, originally 
on the level of the battle between'.Gaunab andTsui-Goab, or between 
Tagar and Suqc. We may regard the local beast- and plant-gods 
of Egypt as survivals of totems and totem-gods like those of Australia, 
India, America, Africa, Siberia and other countries. In this article 
the latter view is adopted. The beast-gods and dualistic and creative 
myths of savages are looked on as the natural product of the savage 
reason and fancy. The same beast-gods and myths in civilized 
Egypt are looked on as survivals from the rude and early condition 
of thought to which such conceptions are natural. 

In the most ancient Egyptian records the gods are not pictorially 
represented, and we have not obtained from these records any 
descriptions of adoration and sacrifice. There is a prayer to the 
Sky on the coffin of the king of Dynasty IV., known as Mycerinus 
to the Greeks. The king describes himself as the child of Sky and 
Earth. He also somewhat obscurely identifies himself with Osiris. 

We thus find Osiris very near the beginning of what is known 
about Egyptian religion. This being is rather a culture-hero, a 
member of a non-natural race of men like Qat or Manabozho, than a 
god. His myth, to be afterwards narrated, is found pictorially 
represented in a tomb and in the late temple of Philae, is frequently 
alluded to in the litanies of the dead about 1400 B.C., is indicated 
with reverent awe by Herodotus, and after the Christian era is 
described at full length by Plutarch. Whether the same myth was 
current in the far more distant days of Mycerinus, it is, of course, 
impossible to say with dogmatic certainty. The religious history 
of Egypt, from perhaps Dynasty X. to Dynasty XX., is interrupted 



by an invasion of Semitic conquerors and Semitic ideas. Prior to 
that invasion the gods, when mentioned in monuments, are always 
represented by animals, and these animals are the object of strictly 
local worship. The name of each god is spelled in hieroglyphs beside 
the beast or bird. The jackal stands for Anup, the hawk for Har, 
the frog for Hekt, the baboon for Tahuti, and Ptah, Asiri, Hesi, 
Nebhat, Hat-hor, Neit, Khnum and Amun-hor are all written out 
phonetically, but never represented in pictures. Different cities 
had their different beast-gods. Pasht, the cat, was the god of 
Bubastis; Apis, the bull, of Memphis; Hapi, the wolf , of Sioot; Ba, 
the goat, of Mendes. The evidence of Herodotus, Plutarch and the 
other writers shows that the Egyptians of each district refused to 
eat the flesh of the animalthey held sacred. So far the identity of 
custom with savage totemism is absolute. Of all the explanations, 
then, of Egyptian animal-worship, that which regards the practice 
as a survival of totemism and of savagery seems the most satis- 
factory. So far Egyptian religion only represented her gods in 
theriomorphic shape. Beasts also appeared in the royal genealogies, 
as if the early Egyptians had filled up the measure of totemism by 
regarding themselves as actually descended from animals. 

With one or two exceptions, " the first (semi-anthropomorphic) 
figures of gods known in the civilized parts ol Egypt are on the granite 
obelisk of Bezig in the Fayytim, erected by Usertesen I. of Dynasty 
XII., and here we find the forms all full-blown at once. The first 
group of deities belongs to a period and a district in which Semitic 
influences had undoubtedly begun to work " (Petrie). From this 
period the mixed and monstrous figures, semi- theriomorphic, semi- 
anthropomorphic, hawk-headed and ram-headed and jackal-headed 
gods become common. This may be attributed to Semitic influence, 
or we may suppose that the process of anthropomorphizing therio- 
morphic gods was naturally developing itself; for Mexico has shown 
us and Greece can show us abundant examples of these mixed 
figures, in which the anthropomorphic god retains traces of his 
theriomorphic past. The heretical worship of the solar disk inter- 
rupted the course of Egyptian religion under some reforming kings, 
but the great and glorious Ramesside Dynasty (XIX.) restored 
" Orus and Isis and the dog Anubis " with the rest of the semi- 
theriomorphic deities. These survived even their defeat by the 
splendid human gods of Rome, and only " fled from the folding 
star of Bethlehem." 

Though Egypt was rich in gods, her literature is not fertile in 
myths. The religious compositions which have survived are, as a 
rule, hymns and litanies, the funereal service, the " Book of the 
Dead." In these works the myths are taken for granted, are 
alluded to in the course of addresses to the divine beings, but, 
naturally, are not told in full. As in the case of the Vedas, hymns 
are poor sources for the study of mythology^ just as the hymns of 
the Church would throw little light on the incidents of the gospel 
story or of the Old Testament. The " sacred legends " which the 
priests or temple servants freely communicated to Herodotus 
are lost through the pious reserve of the traveller. Herodotus 
constantly alludes to the most famous Egyptian myth,that of Osiris, 
and he recognizes the analogies between the Osirian myth and 
mysteries and those of Dionysus. But we have to turn to the very late 
authority of Plutarch (De I side et Osiride) for an account, confessedly 
incomplete and expurgated, of what mythology had to tell about 
the great Egyptian " culture-hero," " daemon, ' and god. Osiris, 
Horus, Typhon (Seth), Isis and Nephthys were the children of Seb 
(whom the Greeks identified with Cronus) ; the myths of their birth 
were peculiarly savage and obscene. Osiris introduced civilization 
into Egypt, and then wandered over the world, making men 
acquainted with agriculture and the arts, as Pund-jel in his humbler 
way did in Australia. On his return Typhon laid a plot for him. 
He had a beautiful carved chest made which exactly fitted Osiris, 
and at an entertainment offered to give it to any one who could lie 
down in it. As soon as Osiris tried, Typhon had the box nailed up, 
and threw it into the Tanaite branch of the Nile. Isis wandered, 
mourning, in search of the body, as Demeter sought Persephone, 
and perhaps in Plutarch's late version some incidents may be 
borrowed from the Eleusinian legend. At length she found the 
chest, which in her absence was again discovered by Typhon. He 
mangled the body of Osiris (as so many gods of all races were mangled), 
and tossed the fragments about. Wherever Isis found a portion 
of Osiris she buried it ; hence Egypt was as rich in graves of Osiris as 
Namaqualand in graves of Heitsi Eibib. The phallus alone she did 
not find, but she consecrated a model thereof; hence (says the myth) 
came the phallus- worship of Egypt. Afterwards Osiris returned 
from the shades, and (in the form of a wolf) urged his son Horus to 
revenge him on Typhon. The gods fought in animal shape (Birch, in 
Wilkinson, iii. 144). Plutarch purposely omits as " too blasphe- 
mous " the legend of the mangling of Horus. Though the graves 
of these non-natural beings are shown, the priests (Dels, et Os. xxi.) 
also show the stars into which they were metamorphosed, as the 
Eskimo and Australians and Aryans of India and Greeks have recog- 
nized in the constellations their ancient heroes. Plutarch remarked 
the fact that the Greek myths of Cronus, of Dionysus, of Apollo and 
the Python, and of Demeter, " all the things that are shrouded in 
mystic ceremonies and are presented in rites," " do not fall short in 
absurdity of the legends about Osiris and Typhon." Plutarch 
naturally presumed that the myths which seem absurd shrouded

some great moral or physical mystery. But we apply no such 
explanation to similar savage legends, and our theory is that the 
Osirian myth is only one of these retained to the time of Plutarch by 
the religious conservatism of a race which, to the time of Plutarch, 
preserved in full vigour most of the practices of totemism. As a 
slight confirmation of the possibility of this theory we may mention 
that Greek mysteries retained two of the features of savage mysteries. 
The first was the rite of daubing the initiated with clay. 1 Jhis 
custom prevails in African mysteries, in Guiana, among Australians, 
Papuans, and Andaman Islanders. The other custom is the use of 
• the turndun, as the Australians call a little fish-shaped piece^ of 
wood tied to a string, and waved so as to produce a loud booming 
and whirring noise and keep away the profane, especially women. 
It is employed in New Mexico, South Africa, New Zealand and 
Australia. This instrument, the kwws, was also used in Greek 
mysteries. 1 Neither the use of the k&vos nor of the clay can very 
well be regarded as a civilized practice retained by savages. The 
hypothesis that the rites and the stories are savage inventions 
surviving into civilized religion seems better to meet the difficulty. 
That the Osirian myth (much as it was elaborated and allegorized) 
originated in the same sort of fancy as the Tacullie story of the 
dismembered beaver out of whose body things were made is a con- 
clusion not devoid of plausibility. Typhon's later career, " commit- 
ting dreadful crimes out of envy and spite, and throwing all things 
into confusion," was parallel to the proceedings of most of the divine 
beings who put everything wrong, in opposition to the being who 
makes everything right. This is perhaps an early " duahstic " 
myth. 

Among other mythic Egyptian figures we have Ra, who once 
destroyed men in his wrath with circumstances suggestive of the 
Deluge ; Khnum, a demiurge, is represented at Philae as making man 
out of clay on a potter's wheel. Here the wheel is added to the 
Maori conception of the making of man. Khnum is said to have 
reconstructed the limbs of the dismembered Osiris. Ptah is the 
Egyptian Hephaestus; he is represented as a dwarf; men are said 
to have come out of his eye, goofs out of his mouth — a story like that 
of Purusha in the Rig Veda^ As creator of man, Ptah is a frog. 
Bubastis became a cat to avoid the wrath of Typhon. Ra, the sun, 
fought the big serpent Apap, as Indra fought Vrittra. Seb is a 
goose,called the great cackler "; he Jaid the creative egg. 3 

Divine Myths of the Aryans of India. Indra. — The gods of the 
Vedas and Brahmanas (the ancient hymns and canonized ritual-books 
of Aryan India) are, on the whole, of the usual polytheistic type. 
More than many other gods they retain in their titles and attributes 
the character of elemental phenomena personified. That personifica- 
tion is, as a rule, anthropomorphic, but traces of theriomorphic 
personification are still very apparent. The ideas which may be 
gathered about the gods from the hymns are (as is usual in heathen 
religions) without consistency. There is no strict orthodoxy. As 
each bard of each bardic family celebrates his favourite god heis apt 
to make him for the moment the pre-eminent deity of all. This way 
of thinking about the gods leads naturally in the direction of a 
pantheistic monotheism in which each divine being may be regarded 
as a manifestation of the one divine essence. No doubt this point 
of view was attained in centuries extremely remote by sages of the 
civilized Vedic world. It is easy, however, to detect certain peculiar 
characteristics of each god. As among races much less advanced 
in civilization than the Vedic Indians, each of the greater powers 
has his own separate department, however much his worshippers 
may be inclined to regard him as an absolute premier with undisputed 
latitude of personal government. Thus Indra is mainly concerned 
with thunder and other atmospheric phenomena; but Vayu is the 
wind, the Maruts are wind-gods, Agni is fire or the god of fire, and 
so connected with lightning. Powerful as Indra is in the celestial 
world, Mitra and Varuna preside over night and day. Ushas is 
the dawn, and Tvashtri is the mechanic among the gods, correspond- 
ing to the Egyptian Ptah and the Greek Hephaestus. Though 
lofty moral qualities and deep concern about the conduct of men 
are attributed to the gods in the Vedic hymns, yet the hymns contain 
traces (and these are amplified in the ritual books) of a divine 
chronique scandaleuse. In this chronique the gods, like other gods, 
are adventurous warriors, adulterers, incestuous, homicidal, given 
to animal transformations, cowardly, and in fact charged with all 
human vices, and credited with magical powers.* It would be 
difficult to speak too highly of the ethical nobility of many Vedic 
hymns. The " hunger and thirst after righteousness " of the sacred

poet recalls the noblest aspirations and regret9 of the Hebrew 
psalmist. But this aspect of the Vedic deities is essentially matter 
for the science of religion rather than of mythology, which is con- 
cerned with the stories told about the gods. Religion is always 
forgetting, or explaining away, or apologizing for these stories. 
Now the Vedic deities, so imposing when regarded as vast natural 
forces (as such forces seem to us), so benignant when appealed to 
as forgivers of sins, have also their mythological aspect. In this 
aspect they are natural phenomena still, but phenomena as originally 
conceived of by the personifying imagination of the savage, and 
credited, like the gods of the Maori or the Australian, with all 
manner of freaks, adventures and disguises. The Veda, it is true, 
does not usually dilate much on the worst of these adventures. 
The Veda contains devotional hymns; we can no more expect much 
narrative here than in the Psalms of David. Again, the religious 
sentiment of the Veda is half-consciously hostile to the stories. As 
M. A. Barth says, " Le sentiment religieux a 6carte" la plupart de 
ces mythes, mais ii ne les a ecartes tons." The Brahmanas, on the 
other hand, later compilations, canonized books for the direction 
of ritual and sacrifice, are rich in senseless and irrational myths. 
Sometimes these myths are probably later than the Veda, mere 
explanations of ritual incidents devised by the priests. Sometimes 
a myth probably older than the Vedas, and maintained in popular 
tradition, is reported in the Brahmanas. The gods in the Veda are 
by no means always regarded as equal in supremacy. There were 
great and small, young and old gods (R. V. 1. 27, 13). Elsewhere 
this is flatly contradicted: " None of you, oh gods, is small or young, 
ye are all great " (R. V. viii. 30, 1). As to the immortality and the 
origin of the gods, there is no orthodox opinion in the Veda. Many 
of the myths of the origin of the divine beings are on a level with the 
Maori theory that Heaven and Earth begat them in the ordinary way. 
Again, the gods were represented as the children of Aditi. This may 
be taken either in a refined sense, as if Aditi were the " infinite 
region from which the solar deities rise, 6 or we may hold with the 
Taittirya-Brahmana 8 that Aditi was a female who, being desirous 
of offspring, cooked a brahmandana offering for the Sadhyas. 
Various other fathers and mothers of the gods are mentioned. 
Some gods, particularly Indra, are said to have won divine rank by 
11 austere fervour *' and asceticism, which is one of the processes 
that makes gods out of mortals even now in India. 7 The gods are 
not always even credited with inherent immortality. Like men, 
they were subject to death, which they overcame in various ways. 
Like most gods, they had struggles for pre-eminence with Titanic 
opponents, the Asuras, who partly answer to the Greek Titans and 
the Hawaiian foes of the divine race, or to the Scandinavian giants 
and the enemies who beset the savage creative beings. Early man, 
living in a state of endless warfare, naturally believes that his gods 
also have their battles. The chief foes of Indra are Vrittra and Ahi, 
serpents which swallow up the waters, precisely as frogs do in Austra- 
lian and Californian and Andaman myths. It has already been 
shown that such creatures, thunder-birds, snakes, dragons, and what 
not, people the sky in the imagination of Zulus, Red Men, Chinese, 
Peruvians, and all the races who believe that beasts hunt the sun 
and moon and cause eclipses. 8 Though hostile to Asuras, Indra 
was once entangled in an intrigue with a woman of that race, accord- 
ing to the Atharva-Veda (Muir, 5. T. v. 82). The gods were less 
numerous than the Asuras, but by a magical stratagem turned some 
bricks into gods (like a creation of new peers to carry a vote) — so says 
the Black Yajur-Veda. 9 

Turning to separate gods, Indra first claims attention, for stories 
of Heaven and Earth are better studied under the heading of myths 
of the origin of things. Indra has this zoomorphic feature in common 
with Heitsi Eibib, the Namaqua god, 10 that his mother, or one of 
his mothers, was a cow (R. V. iv. 18, 1). This statement may be 
a mere way of speaking in the Veda, but it is a rather Hottentot way. 11 
Indra is also referred to as a ram in the Veda, and in one myth this 
ram could fly, like the Greek ram of the fleece of gold. He was 
certainly so far connected with sheep that he and sheep and the 
Kshatriya caste sprang from the breast and arms of Prajapati, a 
kind of creative being. Indra was a great drinker of soma juice; 
a drinking-song by Indra, much bemused with soma, is in R. V. x. 
119. On one occasion Indra got at the soma by assuming the shape 
of a quail. In the Taitt. Samh. (ii. 5; i. 1) Indra is said to have been 
guilty of that most hideous crime, the killing of a Brahmana." 13 
Once, though uninvited, Indra drank some soma that had been 
prepared for another being. The soma disagreed with Indra; part 
of it which was not drunk up became Vrittra the serpent, Indra 's

enemy. Indra cut him in two, and made the moon out of half of 
his body. This serpent was a universal devourer of everything and 
everybody, like Kwai Hemm, the all-devourer in Bushman mytho- 
logy. If this invention is a late priestly one, the person who intro- 
duced it into the Satapatha-Brahmana must have reverted to the 
intellectual condition of Bushmen. In the fight with Vrittra, Indra 
lost his energy, which fell to the earth and produced plants and 
shrubs. In the same way plants, among the Iroquois, were made of 
pieces knocked off Chokanipok in his fight with Manabozho. Vines, 
in particular, are the entrails of Chokanipok. In Egypt, wine was 
the blood of the enemies of the gods. The Aryan versions of this 
sensible legend will be found in Satapatha-Brahmana. 1 The civilized 
mind soon wearies of this stuff, and perhaps enough has been said 
to prove that, in the traditions of Vedic devotees, Indra was not a 
god without an irrational element in his myth. Our argument is, 
that all these legends about Indra, of which only a sample is given, 
have no necessary connexion with the worship of a pure nature-god 
as a nature-god would now be constructed by men. The legends 
are survivals of a time in which natural phenomena were regarded, 
not as we regard them, but as persons, and savage persons, Alcheringa 
folk, in fact, and became the centres of legends in the savage manner. 
Space does not permit us to recount the equally puerile and barbarous 
legends of Vishnu, Agni, the loves of Vivasvat in the form of a horse, 
the adventures of Soma, nor the Vedic amours (paralleled in several 
savage mythologies) of Pururavas and Urvasi. 2 
t Dtyine Myths of Greece. — If any ancient people was thoroughly 
civilized the Greeks were that people. Yet in the mythology and 
religion of Greece we find abundant survivals of savage manners and 
of savage myths. As to the religion, it is enough to point to the 
traces of human sacrifice and to the worship of rude fetish stones. 
The human sacrifices at Salamis in Cyprus and at Alos in Achaia 
Phthiotis may be said to have continued almost to the conversion 
of the empire (Grote i. 125, ed. 1869). Pausanias seems to have 
found human sacrifices to Zeus still lingering in Arcadia in the 2nd 
century of our era. " On this altar on the Lycaean hill they sacrifice 
to Zeus in a manner that may not be spoken, and little liking had I 
to pry far into that sacrifice. But let it be as^ it is, and as it hath 
been from the beginning.*' Now " from the beginning " the sacrifice, 
according to Arcadian tradition, had been z human sacrifice. In 
other places there were manifest commutations of human sacrifice, 
as at tne altar of Artemis the Implacable at Patrae, where Pausanias 
saw the wild beasts being driven into the flames. 3 Many other exam- 
ples of human sacrifice are mentioned in Greek legend. Pausanias 
gives full and interesting details of the worship of rude stones, 
the oldest worship, he says, among the Greeks. Almost every 
temple had its fetish stone on a level with the pumice stone, which is 
the Poseidon of the Mangaians. 4 _ The Argives had a large stone 
called Zeus Cappotas. The oldest idol of the Thespians was a rude 
stone. Another has been found beneath the pedestal of Apollo 
in Delos. In Achaean Pharae were thirty squared stones, each 
named by the name of a god. Among monstrous images of the gods 
which Pausanias, who saw them, regarded as the oldest idols, were 
the three-headed Artemis, each head being that of an animal, the 
Dcmeter with the horse's head, the_ Artemis with the fish's tail, the 
Zeus with three eyes, the ithyphallic Hermes, represented after the 
fashion of the Priapic figures in paintings on the walls of caves 
among the Bushmen. We also hear of the bull and the bull-footed 
Dionysus. Phallic and other obscene emblems were carried abroad 
in processions in Attica both by women and men. The Greek 
custom of daubing _ people all over with clay in the mysteries 
results as we saw in the mysteries of negroes, Australians and 
American races, while the Australian turndun was exhibited 
among the ^oys at the mysteries of Dionysus. The survivals 
of rites, objects of worship, and sacrifices like these prove that 
religious conservatism in Greece retained much of savage practice, 
ana the Greek mythology^ is not less full of ideas familiar to the 
lowest races.' The authorities for Greek mythology are numerous 
and various in character. The oldest sources as literary docu- 
ments are the Homeric and Hesiodic poems. In the Iliad and 
Odyssey the gods and goddesses are beautiful, powerful and immortal 
anthropomorphic beings. The name of Zeus (Skr. Dyaus) clearly 
indicates his connexion with the sky. But in Homer he has long 
ceased to be merely the sky conceived of as a person; he is the

l On the whole subject, Dr Muir's Ancient Sanskrit Texts, with 
'translations, Ludwig's translation of the Rig Veda, the version 
of the Satapatha-Brahmana already referred to, and the translation 
of the Aitareya-Brahmana by Haug, are the sources most open to 
English readers. Max M tiller's translation of the Rig Veda unfor- 
tunately only deals with the hymns to the Maruts. The Indian 
epics and the Puranas belong to a much later date, and are full of 
-deities either unknown to or undeveloped in the Rig Veda and the 
Brahmanas. ^ It is much to be regretted that the Atharva-Veda, 
which contains the magical formulae and incantations of the Vedic 
Indians, is still untranslated, though, by the very nature of its theme, 
it must containjnatter of extreme antiquity and interest.

chief personage in a society of immortals, organized on the type of 
contemporary human society. " There is a great deal of human 
nature ' in his wife Hera (Skr. Svar, Heaven). 6 It is to be remem- 
bered that philologists differ widely as to the origin and meaning of 
the names of almost all the Greek gods. Thus the light which the 
science of language throws on Greek myths is extremely uncertain. 
Hera is explained as " the feminine side of heaven " by some authori- 
ties. The quarrels of Hera with Zeus (which are a humorous 
anthropomorphic study in Homer) are represented as a way of speak- 
ing about winter and rough weather. The other chief Homeric 
deities are Apollo and Artemis, children of Zeus by Leto, a mortal 
mother raised to divinity. Apollo is clearly connected in some way 
with light, as his name <£o?#>s seems to indicate, and with purity, 6 
Homer knows the legend that a giant sought to lay violent hands on 
Leto {Od. xi. 580). Smintheus, one of Apollo's titles in Homer, is 
connected with the field-mouse (ajuktfos), one of his many sacred 
animals. His names, AOkios, J^vKTjyevTjs, were connected by an- 
tiquity with the wolf, by most modern writers with the light. 
According to some legends Leto had been a were-wolf. 7 7The whole 
subject of the relations of Greek gods to animals is best set forth in 
the words of Plutarch (De Is. et Os. lxxi.), where he says that the 
Egyptians worship actual beasts, " whereas the Greeks both speak 
and believe correctly, saying that the dove is the sacred animal of 
Aphrodite, the raven of Apollo, the do£ of Artemis," and so forth. 
Each Greek god had a small menagerie of sacred animals, and it 
may be conjectured that these animals were originally the totems 
of various stocks, subsumed into the worship of the anthropomorphic 
god.*' For the new theory of vegetation spirits and corn spirits see 
The Golden Bough. Apollo, in any case, is the young and beautiful' 
archer-god of Homer; Artemis, his sister, is the goddess of archery, 
who takes her pastime in the chase. She holds no considerable place 
in the Iliad ; in the Odyssey, Nausicaa is compared to her, as to the 
pure and lovely lady of maidenhood. Her name is commonly 
connected with bprenfa — pure, unpolluted. Her close relations 
(un-Homeric) with the bear and bear- worship have suggested a 
derivation from &pktos — "Ap/crejuts. In Homer her " gentle shafts " 
deal sudden and painless death; she is a beautiful Azrael. A much 
more important daughter of Zeus in Homer is Athene, the " grey- 
eyed " or (as some take_ yXavK&iris, rather improbably) the " owl- 
headed "goddess. Her birth from the head of Zeus is not explicitly 
alluded to in Homer. 3 In Homer, Athene is a warlike maiden, the 
patron-goddess of wisdom and manly resolution. In the twenty- 
second book of the Odyssey she assumes the form of a swallow, and 
she can put on the shape 01 any man. She bears the aegis, the awful 
shield of Zeus. Another Homeric child of Zeus, or, according to 
Hesiod (Th. 927), of Hera alone,is Hephaestus, the lame craftsman 
and artificer. In the Iliad 9 will be found some of the crudest 
Homeric myths. Zeus or Hera throws Hephaestus or Ate out of 
heaven, as in the Iroquois myth of the tossing from heaven of 
Ataentsic. There is, as usual, no agreement as to the etymology of 
the name of Hephaestus. Preller inclines to a connexion with 
i$<£0tu, to kindle fire, but Max Muller differs from this theory. 
About the close relations of Hephaestus with fire there can be no 
doubt. He is a rough, kind, good-humoured being in the Iliad. 
In the Odyssey he is naturally annoyed by the adultery of his wife, 
Aphrodite, with Ares. Ares is a god with whom Homer has no 
sympathy. He is a son of Hera, and detested by Zeus {Iliad, v. 890). 
He is cowardly in war, and on one occasion was shut up for years 
in a huge brazen pot. This adventure was even more, ignominious 
than that of Poseidon and Apollo when they were compelled to serve 
Laomedon for hire. The payment he refused, and threatened to 
" cut off their ears with the sword " (Iliad, xxi. 455). Poseidon is to 
the sea what Zeus is to the air, and Hades to the underworld in 
Homer. 10 His own view of his social position may be stated in his 
own words (Iliad, xv. 183, 211). *' Three brethren are we, and sons 
of Cronus, sons whom Rhea bare, even Zeus and myself, and Hades 
is the third, the ruler of the people in the underworld. And in 
three lots were all things divided, and each drew a lot of his own, 11 and 
to me fell the hoary sea, and Hades drew the mirky darkness, and 
Zeus the wide heaven in clear air and clouds, but the earth and high 
Olympus are yet common to all." * 

Zeus, however, is, as Poseidon admits, the elder-born, and there- 
fore the revered head of the family. Thus Homer adopts the system 

6 Cf . Preller, Griechische Mythologie,*\. 128, note 1, for this and 
other philological conjectures. 

6 The derivation of 'AtAXX^ remains obscure. The derivation 
of Leto from \adeiv, and the conclusion that her name means " the 
concealer " — that is, the night, whence the sun is born — is disputed 
by Curtius (Preller i. 190, 191, note 4), but appears to be accepted 
by Max Muller (Selected Essays, i. 386) Latmos being derived from 
the same root as Leto, Latona, the night.

of primogeniture, while Hesiod is all for the opposite and probably 
earlier custom of Jungsten-recht, and makes supreme Zeus the 
youngest of the sons of Cronus. Among the other gods Dionysus 
is but slightly alluded to in Homer as the son of Zeus and Semele, 
as the object of persecution, and as connected with the myth of 
Ariadne. The name of Hermes is derived from various sources, as 
from bppav and 6p/^, or, by Max Miiller, the name is connected 
with Sarameya (Sky). If he had originally an elemental character, 
it is now difficult to distinguish, though interpreters connect him 
with the wind. He is the messenger of the gods, the bringer of good 
luck, and the conductor of men's souls down the dark ways of death. 
In addition to the great Homeric gods, the poet knows a whole 
" Olympian consistory " of deities, nymphs, nereids, sea-gods and 
goddesses, river-gods, Iris the rainbow goddess, Sleep, Demeter 
who lay with a mortal, Aphrodite the goddess of love, wife of Hephaes- 
tus and leman of Ares, and so forth. As to the origin of the gods, 
Homer is not very explicit. He is acquainted with the existence 
of an older dynasty now deposed, the dynasty of Cronus and the 
Titans. In the Iliad (viii. 478) Zeus says to Hera, " For thine anger 
reck I not, not even though thou go to the nethermost bounds of 
earth and sea, where sit Iapetus and Cronus . . . and deep Tartarus 
is round about them." " The gods below that are with Cronus " are 
mentioned (//. xiv. 274; xv. 225). Rumours of old divine wars 
echo in the Iliad , as (i. 400) where it is said that when the other 
immortals revolted against and bound Zeus, Thesis brought to his 
aid Aegaeon of the hundred arms. The streams of Oceanus (//. xiv. 
246) are spoken of as the source of all the gods, and in the same book 
(290) " Oceanus and mother Tethys " are regarded as the parents 
of the immortals. Zeus is usually called Cronion and Cronides, 
which Homer certainly understood to mean " son of Cronus,'* yet it 
is expressly stated that Zeus " imprisoned Cronus beneath the earth 
and the unvintaged sea." The whole subject is only alluded to 
incidentally. On the whole it may be said that the Homeric deities 
are powerful anthropomorphic beings, departmental rulers, united 
by the ordinary social and family ties of the Homeric age, capable 
of pain and pleasure, living on heavenly food, but refreshed by the 
sacrifices of men (Od. v. ioo, 102), able to' assume all forms at will, 
and to intermarry and propagate the species with mortal men and 
women. Their past has been stormy, and their ruler has attained 
power after defeating and mediatizing a more ancient dynasty of his 
own kindred. 

From Hesiod we receive a much more elaborate — probably a 
more ancient, certainly a more barbarous — story of the gods and 
their origin. In the beginning the gods (here used in a wide sense 
to denote an early non-natural race) were begotten by Earth and 
Heaven, conceived of as beings with human parts and passions 
(Hesiod, Theog. 45). This idea recurs in Maori, Vedic and Chinese 
mythology. Heaven and Earth, united in an endless embrace, 
produced children which never saw the light. In New Zealand, 
Chinese, Vedic, Indian and Greek myths the pair had to be sundered. 1 
Hesiod enumerates the children whom Earth bore " when couched 
in love with Heaven." They are Ocean, Coeus, Crius, Hyperion, 
Iapetus, Theia, Rhea, Themis, Mnemosyne, Phoebe, Tethys and the 
youngest, Cronus, " and he hated his glorious father." Others of 
this early race were the Cyclopes, Bronte, Sterope and Arge, and 
three children of enormous strength, Cottus, Briareus (Aegaeon) 
and Gyes, each with one hundred hands and fifty heads.-; Uranus 
detested his offspring, and hid them in crannies of Earth. Earth 
excited Cronus to attack the father, whom he castrated with a 
sickle. From the blood of Uranus (this feature is common in Red 
Indian and Egyptian myths) were born furies, giants, ash-nymphs 
and Aphrodite. A number of monsters, as Echidna, Geryon and 
the hound of hell, were born of the loves of various | elemental 
powers. The chief stock of the divine species was continued by 
the marriage of Rhea (probably another form of the Earth) with 
Cronus. . Their children were Hestia, Demeter, Hera, Hades and 
Poseidon. All these Cronus swallowed; and this " swallow-myth " 
occurs in Australia, among the Bushmen, in Guiana, in Brittany 
(where Gargantua did the swallow-trick) and elsewhere. At last 
Rhea bore Zeus, and gave Cronus a stone in swaddling bands, 
which he disposed of in the usual way. Zeus grew up, administered 
an emetic to Cronus (some say Metis did this), and had the satis- 
faction of seeing all his brothers and sisters disgorged alive. The 
stone came forth first, and Pausanias saw it at Delphi (Paus. x. 24). 
Then followed the wars between Zeus and the gods he had rescued 
from the maw of Cronus against the gods of the elder branch, the 
children of Uranus and Gaea — Heaven and Earth. The victory 
remained with the younger branch, the immortal Olympians^ of 
Homer. The system of Hesiod is a medley of later physical 
speculation and of poetic allegory, with matter which we, at least, 
regard as savage survivals, like the mutilation of Heaven and the 
swallow-myth. 2

1 Bleek, Bushman Folk-Lore, pp. 6-8. Max Miiller suggests 
another theory {Selected Essays, i. 460) : " Kp6ror did not exist 
till long after Z«6s in Greece." The name Kporltav, or Kpovlfys, 
looks like a patronymic. Miiller, however, thinks it originally 
meant only connected with time, existing through all time. 
Very much later the name was mistaken for a genuine patronymic, 



In Homer and in Hesiod myths enter the region of literature, 
and become, as it were, national. But it is probable that the local 
myths of various cities and temples, of the " sacred chapters " 
which were told by the priests to travellers and in the mysteries to 
the initiated, were older in form than the epic and national myths. 
Of these " sacred chapters " we have fragments and hints in Hero- 
dotus, Pausanias, in the mythographers, like Apollodorus, in the 
tragic poets, and in the ancient scholia or notes on the classics. 
From these sources come almost all the more inhuman, bestial 
and discreditable myths of the gods. In these we more distinctly 
perceive the savage element. The gods assume animal forms: 
Cronus becomes a horse, Rhea a mare ; Zeus begets separate families 
of men in the shape of a bull, an ant, a serpent, a swan. His mistress 
from whom the Arcadians claim descent becomes a she-bear. It 
is usual with mythologists to say that Zeus is the " All-Father," and 
that his amours are only a poetic way of stating that he is the parent 
of men. But why does he assume so many animal shapes ? Why 
did various royal houses claim descent from the ant, the swan, the 
she-bear, the serpent, the horse and so forth ? We have already 
seen that this is the ordinary pedigree of savage stocks in Asia, 
Africa, Australia and America, while animals appear among Irish 
tribes and in Egyptian and ancient English genealogies.* It is a 
plausible hypothesis that stocks which once claimed descent from 
animals, sans phrase, afterwards regarded the animals as avatars 
of Zeus. In the same way " the Minas, a non- Aryan tribe of Rajpu- 
tana, used to worship the pig; when the Brahmans got a turn at 
them, the pig became an avatar of Vishnu " (Lyall, Asiatic Studies). 
The tales of divine cannibalism to which Pindar refers with awe, 
the mutilation of Dionysus Zagreus, the unspeakable abominations 
of Dionysus, the loves of Hera in the shape of a cuckoo, the divine 
powers of metamorphosing men and *women into beasts and stars 
— these tales come to us as echoes of the period of savage thought. 
Further evidence on this point will be given below in a classification 
of the principal mythic^ legends. The general conclusion is that 
many of the Greek deities were originally elemental, the elements 
being personified in accordance with the laws of savage imagina- 
tions.^ But we cannot explain each detail in the legends as a myth 
of this or that natural phenomenon or process as understood by 
ourselves. Various stages of late and early fancy have contributed 
to the legends. Zeus is the sky, but not our sky ; he had originally 
a personal character, and that a savage or barbarous character. 
He probably attracted into his legend stories that did not origi- 
nally belong to him. He became anthropomorphic, and his myth 
was handled by local priests, by family bards, by national poets, 
by early philosophers. His legend is a complex embroidery on a 
very ancient tissue. The other divine myths are equally complex. 

See L. R. Farnell, Cults of the Greek States; Miss Jane Harrison, 
Prolegomena to Greek Religion; and Frazer, The Golden Bough, 
especially as regards the vegetable or " probably arboreal " aspect 
of Zeus. 

Scandinavian Divine Myths. — The Scandinavian myths of the 
gods are numerous and interesting, but the evidence on which they 
nave reached us demands criticism for which we lack space. That 
there are in the Eddas and Sagas early ideas and later ideas tinged 
by Christian legend seems indubitable, but philological and historical 
learning^has by no means settled the questions of relative purity 
and antiquity lin the myths. The Eddie songs, according to F. Y. 
Powell, one of the editors of the Corpus poeticum septentrionale 
(the best work on the subject), " cannot date earlier " in their 
present form " than the 9th century," and may be vaguely placed 
between a.d. 800-1100. The collector of the fEdda probably 
had the old poems recited to him in the 13th century, and where 
there was a break in the memory of the reciters the lacuna was 
filled up in prose. " As one goes through the poems, one is ever 
and anon face to face with a myth of the most childish and barbaric 
type," # which " carries one back to prae-Aryan days." Side by 
side with these old stories come fragments of a different stratum 
of thought, Christian ideas, the belief in a supreme God. the notion 
of Doomsday. The Scandinavian cosmogonic myth (with its 
parallels among races savage and civilized) is given elsewhere. 
The most important god is Odin, the son of Bestla and Bor, the 
husband of Frigg, the father of Balder and many other sons, the 
head of the Aesir stock of gods. Odin's name is connected with 
that of Wuotan, and referred to the Old High-German verb watan 
wuot = meare, cum impetu ferri (Grimm, Teut. Myth., Eng. transl., 



and " Zeus the ancient of days " became " Zeus the son of Cronus." 
Having thus got a Cronus, the Greeks — and " the misunderstanding 
could have happened in Greece only " — needed a myth of Cronus. 
They therefore ' invented or adapted the "swallow-myth" so 
familiar to Bushmen and Australians. This singular reversion to 
savagery itself needs some explanation. But the hypothesis that 
Cronus is a late derivation from KpovtSrjs and KpovUav is by no 
means universally accepted. Others derive Kp6ros from Kpaivco, 
and connect it with Kpbvia, a kind of harvest-home festival. 
Schwartz (Prdhistorisch-anthropologische Studien) readily proves 
Cronus to be the storm, swallowing the clouds. Perhaps we may 
say of Schwartz's view, as he says of Preller's — " das ist Gedanken- 
spiel, aber nimmermehr Mythologie."

i. 131). Odin would thus (if we admit the etymology) be the 
swift goer, the " ganger," and it seems superfluous to make him 
(with Grimm) " the all-powerful, all-permeating being,*' a very 
abstract and scarcely an early conception. Odin's brethren (in 
GylfVs Mocking) are Vile and Ve, who with him slew Ymir the 
giant, and made all things out of the fragments of his body. They 
also made man out of two stocks. In the Hava-Mal Odin claims 
for himself most of the attributes of the medicine-man. In Loka 
Senna, Loki, the evil god, says that " Odin dealt in magic in 
Samsey." The goddess Frigg remarks, " Ye should never talk of 
your old doings before men, of what ye two Aesir went through in 
old times." But many relics of these " old times," many traces 
of the medicine-man and the " skin-shifter," survive in the myth of 
Odin. When he stole Suttung's mead (which answers somewhat 
to nectar and the Indian soma), he flew away in the shape of an 
eagle. 1 The hawk is sacred to Odin ; one of his names is " the 
Raven-god." He was usually represented as one-eyed, having 
left an eye in pawn that he might purchase a draught from Mimir's 
well. This one eye is often explained as the sun. Odin's wife 
was Frigg; their sons were Thor (the thunder-god) and Balder, 
whose myth is well known in English poetry. The gods were 
divided into two — not always friendly — stocks, the Aesir and Vanir. 
Their relations are, on the whole, much more amicable than those 
of the Asuras and Devas in Indian mythology. Not necessarily 
immortal, the gods restored their vigour by eating the apples of 
Iduna. Asa Loki was a being of mixed race, half god, half gianti 
and wholly mischievous and evil. His legend includes animal 
metamorphoses of the most obscene character. In the shape of 
a mare he became the mother of the eight-legged horse of Odin. 
He borrowed the hawk-dress of Freya, when he recovered the 
apples of Iduna. Another" Eddie god, Hoene, is described in 
phrases from lost poems as " the long-legged one," " lord of the 
ooze," and his name is connected with that of the crane. The con- 
stant enemies pi the gods, the giants, could also assume animal 
forms. Thus in Thiodolf's Haust-long (composed after the settle- 
ment of Iceland) we read about a shield on which events from myth- 
ology were painted; among these was the flight of " giant Thiazzi 
in an ancient eagle's feathers." The god Herindal and Loki once 
fought a battle in the shapes of seals. On the whole, the Scan- 
dinavian gods are a society on an early human model, of beings 
indifferently human, animal and divine — some of them derived 
from elemental forces personified, holding sway over the elements, 
and skilled in sorcery. Probably after the viking days came in the 
conceptions of the last war of gods, and the end of all, and the theory 
of Odin All-Father as a kind of emperor in the heavenly world. 
The famous tree that lives through all the world is regarded as 
" foreign, Christian, and confined to few poems." There is, almost 
undoubtedly, a touch of the Christian dawn on the figure and 
myth of the pure and beloved and ill-fated god Balder, and his 
descent into hell. The whole subject is beset with critical diffi- 
culties, and we have chiefly noted features which can hardly be 
regarded as late, and which correspond with widely distributed 
mythical ideas. 

Dasent's Prose or Younger Edda (Stockholm, 1842); the Corpus 
Septentrionale already referred to; C. F. Keary's Mythology of the 
Eddas (1882); Pigott's Manual of Scandinavian Mythology (1838); 
and Laing's Early Kings of Norway may be consulted by English 
students. 

Classification of Myths. — It is now necessary to cast a hasty 
glance over the chief divisions of myths. These correspond to 
the chief problems which the world presents to the curiosity of 
untutored men. They ask themselves (and the answers are 
given in myths) the following questions: What is the Origin 
of the World ? The Origin of Man ? Whence came the Arts 
of Life? Whence the Stars? Whence the Sun and Moon? 
What is the Origin of Death? How was Fire procured by Man? 
The question of the origin of the marks and characteristics of 
various animals and plants has also produced a class of myths 
in which the marks are said to survive from some memorable 
adventure, or the plants and animals to be metamorphosed 
human beings. Examples of all these myths are found among 
savages and in the legends of the ancient civilizations. A few 
such examples may now be given. 

Myths of the Origin of the World.— We have found it difficult to 
keep myths of the gods apart from myths of the origin of the world 
and of man, because gods are frequently regarded as creative 
powers. The origin of things is a problem which has everywhere 

1 Indra was a hawk when, " being well-winged, he carried to 
men the food tasted by the gods " (R. V. iv. 26, 4). Yehl, the 
Tlingit god-hero, was a raven or a crane when he stole the water 
(Bancroft iii. 100-102). The prevalence of animals, or of god- 
animals, in myths of the stealing of water, soma and fire, is very 
remarkable. Among the Andaman Islanders, a kingfisher steals 
fire for men from the god Puluga {Anthrop. Journal, November 
1882). 



exercised thought, and been rudely solved in myths. These vary- 
in quality with the civilization of the races in which they are current, 
but the same ideas which we proceed to state pervade all cosmo- 
gonical myths, savage and civilized. All these legends waver 
between the theory of creation, or rather of manufacture, and the 
theory of evolution. The earth, as a rule, is supposed to have 
grown out of some original matter, perhaps an animal, perhaps an 
egg which floated on the waters, perhaps a fragment of soil fished 
up out of the floods by a beast or a god. But this conception does 
not exclude the idea that many of the things in the world — minerals, 
plants, people, and what not — are fragments of the frame of an 
animal or non-natural magnified man, or are excretions from the 
body of a god. We proceed to state briefly the various forms of 
these ideas. The most backward races usually assume the prior 
existence of the earth. 

The aborigines of the northern parts of Victoria (Australia) 
believe that the earth was made by Pund-jel, the bird-creator, 
who sliced the valleys with a knife. Another Australian theory is 
that the men of a previous race, the Nooralie (very old ones), made 
the earth. 

The problem of the origin of the world seems scarcely to have 
troubled the Bushmen. They know about " men who brought 
the sun," but their doctrines are revealed in mysteries, and Qing^ 
the informant of Mr Orpen {Capejdonthly Magazine, July 1874), 
14 did not dance that dance " — that is, had not been initiated into- 
all the secret doctrines of his tribe. According to Qing, creation 
was the work of Cagn (the mantis insect), " he gave orders and 
caused all things to appear.*' Elsewhere in the myth Cagn made 
or manufactured things by his skill. 

As a rule the most backward races, while rich in myths of the 
origin of men, animals, plants, stones and stars, do not say much 
about the making of the world. Among people a little more ad- 
vanced, the earth is presumed to have grown out of the waters. In 
the Iroquois myth (Lafitau, Mceurs des sauvages, 1724), a heavenly 
woman was tossed out of heaven, and fell on a turtle, which 
developed into the world. Another North- American myth assumes 
a single island in the midst of the waters, and this island grew into- 
the world. The Navaho and the Digger Indians take earth for 
granted as a starting-point in their myths. The Winnebagos, not 
untouched by Christian doctrine, do not go farther back. The 
Great Manitou awoke and found himself alone. He took a piece of 
his body and a piece of earth and made a man. Here the existence 
of earth is assumed (Bancroft iv. 228). Even in Guatemala, 
though the younger sons of a divine race succeed in making the 
earth where the elder son (as usual) failed, they all had a supply of 
clay as first material. The Pima, a Central-American tribe, say 
the earth was made by a powerful being, and at first appeared 
" like a spider's web." This reminds one of the Ananzi or spider 
creator of West Africa. The more ^metaphysical Tacullies of 
British Columbia say that in the beginning nought existed but 
water and a musk-rat. The musk-rat sought his food at the 
bottom of the water, and his mouth was frequently filled with mud. 
This he kept spitting out, and so formed an island, which developed 
into the world. Among the Tinneh, the frame of a dog (which 
could assume the form of a handsome young man) became the first 
material of most things. The dog, like Osiris, Dionysus, Purusha- 
and other gods, was torn to pieces by giants ; the fragments became 
many of the things in the world (Bancroft i. 106). Even here the 
existence of earth for the dog to live in is assumed. 

Coming to races more advanced in civilization, we find the New 
Zealanders in possession of ancient hymns in which the origin of 
things is traced back to nothing, to darkness, and to a metaphysical 
process from nothing to something, from being to becoming. The 
hymns may be read in Sir George Grey's Polynesian Mythology, and 
in Taylor's New Zealand. It has been suggested that these hymns 
bear traces of Buddhist and Indian influence; in any case, they are 
rather metaphysical than mystical. Myth comes in when the 
Maoris represent Rangi and Papa, Heaven and Earth, as two vast 
beings, male and female, united in a secular embrace, and finally 
severed by their children, among whom Tane Mahuta takes the 
part of Cronus in the Greek myth. The gods were partly elemental, 
partly animal in character; the lists of their titles show that every 
human crime was freely attributed to them. In the South Sea 
Islands, generally, the fable of the union and seoaration of Heaven 
and Earth is current; other forms will be found in Gill's Myths and 
Songs from the South Pacific. 

The cosmogonic myths of the Aryans of India are peculiarly 
interesting, as we find in the Vedas and Brahmanas and Puranas- 
almost every fiction familiar to savages side by side with the most 
abstract metaphysical speculations. We have the theory that 
earth grew, as in the Iroquois story of the turtle, from a being 
named Uttanapad (Muir v. 335). We find that Brahma naspati 
11 blew the gods forth from his mouth," and one of the gods, 
Tvashtri, the mechanic among the deities, is credited with having 
fashioned the earth and the heaven (Muir v. 354). The " Purusha 
Sukta," the 90th hymn of the tenth book of the Jtfg Veda, gives us 
the Indian version of the theory that all things were made out of 
the mangled limbs of Purusha, a magnified non-natural man, who- 
was sacrificed by the gods. As this hymn gives an account of the 
origin of the castes (which elsewhere are scarcely recognized in the 



MYTHOLOGY 



H3 






Rig Veda), it is sometimes regarded as a late addition. But we can 
scarcely think the main conception late, as it is so widely scattered 
that it meets us in most mythologies, including those of Chaldaea 
and Egypt, and various North-American tribes. Not satisfied 
with this myth, the Aryans of India accounted for the origin of 
species in the following barbaric style. A being named Purusha 
was alone in the world. He differentiated himself into two beings, 
husband and wife. The wife, regarding union with her producer 
as incest, fled from his embraces as Nemesis did from those of 
Zeus, and Rhea from Cronus, assuming various animal disguises. 
The husband pursued in the form of the male of each animal, and 
from these unions sprang the various species of beasts (Satapatha- 
Brahmana, xiv. 4, 2; Muir i. 25). The myth of the cosmic egg 
from which all things were produced is also current in the Brah- 
manas. In the Puranas we find the legend of many successive 
creations and destructions of the world a myth of world-wide 
distribution. 

As a rule, destruction by a deluge is the most favourite myth, 
but destructions by fire and wind and by the wrath of a god are 
common in Australian, Peruvian and Egyptian tradition. The 
idea that a boar, or a god in the shape of a boar, fished up a bit of 
earth, which subsequently became the world, out of the waters, is 
very well known to the Aryans of India, and recalls the feats of 
American musk-rats and coyotes already described. 1 The tortoise 
from which all things sprang, in a myth of the Satapatha-Brahmana, 
reminds us of the Iroquois turtle. The Greek and Mangaian myth 
of the marriage of Heaven and Earth and its dissolution is found 
in the Aitareya-Brahmana (Haug's trans, ii. 308; Rig Veda, i. lxii.). 

So much for the Indian cosmogonic myths, which are a collection 
of ideas familiar to savages, blended with sacerdotal theories and 
ritual mummeries. The philosophical^ theory of the origin of things, 
a hymn of remarkable stateliness, is in Rig Veda, x. 129. The 
Scandinavian cosmogonic myth starts from the abyss, Ginnungagap, 
a chaos of ice, from which, as it thawed, was produced the giant 
Ymir. Ymir is the Scandinavian Purusha. A man and woman 
sprang from his armpit, like Athene from the head of Zeus. A 
cow licked the hoar-frost, whence rose Bur, whose children, Odin, 
Vile and Ve, slew the giant Ymir. " Of his flesh they formed the 
earth, of his blood seas and waters, of his bones mountains, of his 
teeth rocks and stones, of his hair all manner of plants." This is 
the story in the Prose Edda, derived from older songs, such as the 
Grimnersmal. However the distribution of this singular myth may 
be explained, its origin can scarcely be sought in the imagination 
of races higher in culture than the Tinneh and Tacullies, among 
whom dogs and beavers are the theriomorphic form of Purusha or 
Ymir. -> * *^ 

Myths of the Origin oj Man. — These partake of the conceptions 
of evolution and of creation. Man was made out of clay by a super- 
natural being. Australia: man was made by Pund-jel. New 
Zealand: man was made by Tiki; " he took red clay, and- kneaded 
it with his own blood." Mangaia: the woman of the abyss made 
a child from a piece of flesh plucked out of her own side. Melanesia: 
" man was made of clay, red from the marshy side of Vanua Levu"; 
woman was made by Qat of willow twigs. Greece: men were 
TrXcur/xara injXov, figures Hbaked in clay by Prometheus. 2 India: 
men were made after many efforts, in which the experimental 
beings did not harmonize with their environment, by Prajapati. 
In another class of myths, man was evolved out of the lower animals 
— lizards in Australia; coyotes, beavers, apes and other beasts in 
America. The Greek myths of the descent of the Arcadians, 
Myrmidons, children of the swan, the cow, and so forth, may be 
compared. Yet again, men came out of trees or plants or rocks: 
as from the Australian wattle-gum, the Zulu bed of reeds, the great 
tree of the Ovahereros, the rock of the tribes in Central Africa, the 
cave of Bushman and North- American and Peruvian myth, " from 
tree or stone " {Odyssey, xix. 163). This view was common among 
the Greeks, who boasted of being autochthonous. The Cephisian 
marsh was one scene of man's birth according to a fragment of 
Pindar, who mentions Egyptian and Libyan legends of the same 
description. 

Myths of the Arts of Life. — These are almost unanimously 
attributed to " culture-heroes," beings theriomorphic or anthropo- 
morphic, who, like Pund-jel, Qat, Quawteaht, Prometheus, 
Manabozho, Quetzalcoatl, Cagn and the rest, taught men the use 
of the bow, the processes (wnere known) of pottery, agriculture 
(as Demeter), the due course of the mysteries, divination, and 
everything else they knew. Commonly the teacher disappears 
mysteriously. He is often regarded by modern mythologists as 
the sun. 

Star Myths. — " The stars came otherwise," says Browning's 
Caliban. In savage and civilized myths they are usually meta- 
morphosed men, women and beasts. I n _ Australia, the Pleiades, 
as in Greece, were girls. Castor and Pollux in Greece, as in Australia, 
were young men. Our Bear was a bear, according to Charlevoix 
and Lafitau, among the North-American Indians; the Eskimo, 

1 Black Yajur-Veda and Satapatha- Brahmana; Muir, i. 52. 

1 Aristophanes, Aves, 686; Etym. Magn., s.v. 'Ubviov. Pausanias 
saw the clay (Paus. x. iv.). The story is also quoted by Lactantius 
from Hesiod. 



according to Egede, who settled the Danish colony in Greenland, 
regarded the stars " very nonsensically," as "so many of their 
ancestors"; the Egyptian priests showed Plutarch the stars that 
had been I sis and Osiris. Aristophanes, in the Pax, shows us that 
the belief in the change of men into stars survived in his own day 
in Greece. The Bushmen (Bleek) have the same opinion. The 
Satapatlta-Brahmana (Sacred Books of the East, xii. 284) shows 
how Prajapati, in his incestuous love, turned himself into a roe- 
buck, his daughter into a doe, and how both became constellations. 
This is a thoroughly good example of the savage myths (as in Peru, 
according to Acosta) by which beasts and anthropomorphic gods 
and stars are all jumbled together.' The Rig Veda contains 
examples of the idea that the good become stars. 

Solar and Lunar Myths. — These are universally found, and are 
too numerous to be examined here. The sun and moon, as in the 
Bulgarian ballad of the Sun's Bride (a mortal girl), are looked on 
as living beings. In Mexico they were two men, or gods of a human 
character who were burned. The Eskimo know the moon as a 
man who visits earth, and, again, as a girl who had her face spotted 
by ashes which the Sun threw at her. The Khasias make the sun 
a woman, who daubs the face of the moon, a man. The Homeric 
hymn to Helios, as Max Muller observes, " looks on the sun as a 
half-god, almost a hero, who had once lived on earth." This is 
precisely the Bushman view; the sun was a man who irradiated 
light from his armpit. In New Zealand and in North America 
the sun is a beast, whom adventurers have trapped and beaten. 
Medicine has been made with his blood. In the Andaman Islands 
the Sun is the wife of the Moon (Jour, of A nth. Soc, 1882). Among 
aboriginal tribes in India (Dal ton, p. 186) the Moon is the "Sun's 
bride; she was faithless and he cut her in two, but occasionally 
lets her shine in full beauty. The Andaman Islanders account for 
the white brilliance of the moon by saying that he is daubing 
himself with white clay, a custom common in savage and Greek 
mysteries. The Red Men accounted to the Jesuits for the spherical 
forms of sun and moon by saying that their appearance was caused 
by their bended bows. The Moon in Greek myths loved Endymion, 
and was bribed to be the mistress of Pan by the present of a 
fleece, like the Dawn in Australia, whose unchastity was rewarded 
by a gift of a red cloak of opossum skin. Solar and lunar myths 
usually account for the observed phenomena of eclipse, waning 
and waxing, sunset, spots on the moon, and so forth by various 
mythical adventures of the animated heavenly beings. In modern 
folk-lore the moon is a place to which bad peopleare sent, rather 
than a woman or a man. The mark of the hare in the moon has 
struck the imagination of Germans, Mexicans, Hottentots, Sinhalese, 
and produced myths among all these races. 4 

Myths of Death. — Few savage races regard death as a natural 
event. All natural deaths are supernatural with them. Men are 
assumed to be naturally immortal, hence a series of myths to 
account for the origin of death. Usually some custom or " taboo " 
is represented as having been broken, when death has followed. 
In New Zealand, Maui was not properly baptized. In Australia, 
a woman was told not to go near a certain tree where a bat lived; 
she infringed the prohibition, the bat fluttered out, and men died. 
The Ningphoos were dismissed^ from Paradise and became mortal, 
because one of them bathed in water which had been tabooed 
(Dalton, p. 13). In the Atharva Veda y Yama, like Maui in New 
Zealand, first " spied out the path to the other world," which all 
men after him have taken. In the Rig Veda (x. id), Yama " sought 
out a road for many." In the Solomon Islands (Jour, Anth, Inst., 
Feb. 1881), " Koevari was the author of death, by resuming her 
cast-off skin." The same story is told in the Banks Islands. In 
the Greek myth (Hesiod, Works and Days, 90), men lived without 
" ill diseases that give death to men " till the cover was lifted 
from the forbidden box of Pandora. As to the myths of Hades, 
the place of the dead, they are far too many to be mentioned in 
detail. In almost all the gates of hell are guarded by fierce beasts, 
and in Ojibway, Finnish, Greek, Papuan and Japanese myths no 
mortal visitor may escape from Hades who has once tasted the 
food of the dead. 

Myths of m Fire-stealing. — Those current in North America (where 
an animal is commonly the thief) will be found in Bancroft, vol. iv. 
The Australian version, singularly like one Greek legend, is given 
by Brough Smyth. Stories of the theft of Prometheus are recorded 
by Hesiod, Aeschylus, and their commentators. Muir and Kuhn 
may be consulted for Vedic fire-stealing. 

Heroic and Romantic Myths. — In addition to myths which are 
clearly intended to explain facts of the universe, most nations have 
their heroic and romantic myths. Familiar examples are the 
stories of Perseus, Odysseus, Sigurd, the Indian epic stories, the 
adventures of Ilmarinen and Wainamoinen in the Kalewala, and 
so forth. To discuss these myths as far as they can be considered 
apart from divine and explanatory tales would demand more space 
than we have at our disposal. It will become evident to any 
student of the romantic myths that they consist of different arrange-

MYXOEDEMA— MYZOSTOMIDA 



ments of a rather limited set of incidents. These incidents have 
been roughly classified by Von Hahn. 1 We may modify his arrange- 
ment as follows. 

There is (i) the story of a bride or bridegroom who transgresses 
a commandment of a mystic nature, and disappears as a result of 
the sin. The bride sins as in Eros and Psyche, Freja and Oddur, 
Pururavas and Urvasi. 2 The sin of Urvasi and Psyche was seeing 
their husbands — naked in the latter case. The sin was against 
" the manner of women." Now therule of etiquette which forbids 
seeing or naming the husband (especially the latter) is of the widest 
distribution. The offence in the Welsh form of the story is naming 
the partner — a thing forbidden among early Greeks and modern 
Zulus. Presumably the tale (with its example of the sanction) sur- 
vives the rule in many cases. (2) " Penelope formula." The man 
leaves the wife and returns after many years. A good example 
occurs in Chinese legend. (3) Formula of the attempt to avoid 
fate or the prophecy of an oracle. This incident takes numerous 
shapes, as in the story of the fatal birth of Perseus, Paris, the 
Egyptian prince shut up in a tower, the birth of Oedipus. (4) 
Slaughter of a monster. This is best known in the case of Andro- 
meda and Perseus. (5) Flight, by aid of an animal usually, from 
cannibalism, human sacrifice, or incest. The Greek example is 
Phrixus, Helle, and the ram of the golden fleece. (6) Flight of a 
lady and her lover from a giant father or wizard father. Jason 
and Medea furnish the Greek example. (7) The youngest brother 
the successful adventurer, and the head of the family. We have 
seen the example of Greek mythic illustrations of " Jiingsten- 
recht," or supremacy of the youngest, in the Hesiodic myth of 
Zeus, the youngest child of Cronus. (8) Bride given to whoever 
will accomplish difficult adventures or vanquish girl in race. The 
custom of giving a bride without demanding bride-price, in reward 
for a great exploit, is several times alluded to in the Iliad, In 
Greek heroic myth Jason thus wins Medea, and (in the race) Milanion 
wins Atalanta. In the Kalewala much of the Jason cycle, including 
this part, recurs. The rider through the fire wins Brunhild but 
this may belong to another cycle of ideas. (9) The grateful beasts, 
who, having been aided by the hero, aid him in his adventures. 
Melampus and the snakes is a Greek example. This story is but 
one specimen of the personal human character of animals in myths, 
already referred to the intellectual condition of savages. (10) 
Story of the strong man and his adventures, and stories of the 
comrades Keen-eye, Quick-ear, and the rest. Jason has comrades 
like these, as had Ilmarinen and Heracles, the Greek " strong man." 
(11) Adventure with an ogre, who is blinded and deceived by a 
pun of the hero's. Odysseus and Polyphemus is the Greek ex- 
ample. (12) Descent into Hades of the hero. Heracles, Odysseus, 
Wainamoinen in the Kalewala, are the best-known examples in 
epic literature. These are twelve specimens of the incidents, to 
which we may add (13) " the false bride," as in the poem of Berte 
aux grans Pits, and (1^) the legend of the bride said to produce 
beast-children. The belief in the latter phenomenon is very common 
in Africa, and in the Arabian Nigkts t 2inh we have seen it in America. 

Of these formulae (chosen because illustrated by Greek heroic 
legends) — (1) is a sanction of barbarous nuptial etiquette; (2) is an 
obvious ordinary incident; (3) is moral, and both (3) and (1) may 
pair off with all the myths of the origin of death from the infringe- 
ment of a taboo or sacred command; (^) would naturally occur 
wherever, as on the West Coast of Africa, human victims have 
been offered to sharks or other beasts; (5) the storyof flight from 
a horrible crime, occurs in some stellar myths, and is an easy and 
natural invention; (6) flight from wizard father or husband, is 
found in Bushman and Namaqua myth, where the husband is an 
elephant; (7) success of youngest brother, may have been an ex- 
planation and sanction of " Jiingsten-recht " — Maui in New Zealand 
is an example, and Herodotus found the story among the Scythians; 
(8) the bride given to successful adventurer, is consonant with 
heroic manners as late as Homer; (9) is no less consonant with the 
belief that beasts have human sentiments and supernatural powers; 
(10) the " strong man," is found among Eskimo and Zulus, and was 
an obvious invention when strength was the most admired of 
qualities; (11) the baffled ogre, is found among Basques and Irish, 
and turns on a form of punning which inspires an " ananzi " story 
in West Africa; (12) descent into Hades, is the natural result of 
the savage conception of Hades, and the tale is told of actual living 
people in the Solomon Islands and in New Caledonia ; Eskimo 
Angekoks can and do descend into Hades — it is the prerogative of 
the necromantic magician; (13) "the false bride/' found among 
the Zulus, does not permit of such easy explanation — naturally, 
in Zululand, the false bride is an animal; (14) the bride accused of 
bearing beast -children, has already been disposed of; the belief is 
inevitable where no distinction worth mentioning is taken between 
men and animals. English folk-lore has its woman who bore 
rabbits. 

The formulae here summarized, with others, are familiar in the 
marchen of Samoyeds, Zulus, Bushmen, Hottentots and Red 
Indians. For an argument intended to show that Greek heroic

myths may be adorned and classified marchen, in themselves 
survivals of savage fancy, see Fortnightly Review, May 1872, " Myths 
and Fairy Tales." The old explanation was that marchen are 
degenerate heroic myths. This does not explain the marchen of 
African, and perhaps not of Siberian races. 

In this sketch of mythology that of Rome is not included, because 
its most picturesque parts are borrowed from or adapted into 
harmony^ with the mythology of Greece. Greece, India and Scandi- 
navia will supply a fair example of Aryan mythology (without 
entering on the difficult Slavonic and Celtic fields). (A. L,) 

MYXOEDEMA (or athyrea), the medical term for a constitu- 
tional disease (see Metabolic Diseases) due to the degeneration 
of the thyroid gland, and occurring in adults; it may be con- 
trasted with cretinism, which is a condition appearing in early 
childhood. There are two forms, myxoedema proper and opera- 
tive myxoedema {cachexia slrumipriva) . (1) Myxoedema has 
been termed "Gull's Disease" from Sir William Gull's observa- 
tions in 1873. Women are more often the victims than men, in 
a ratio of 6 to 1 . It frequently affects members of the same 
family and may be transmitted through the mother, and it has 
been observed sometimes to follow exophthalmic goitre. • The 
symptoms are a marked increase in hulk and weight of the body, 
puffy appearance of skin which does not pit on pressure, the line 
of the features becoming obliterated and getting coarse and 
broad, the lips thick and nostrils enlarged, with loss of hair, 
subnormal temperature and marked mental changes. There is 
striking slowness of thought and action, the memory becomes 
defective, and the patient becomes irritable and suspicious. 
In some instances the condition progresses to that of dementia. 
The thyroid gland itself is diminished in size, and may become 
completely atrophied and converted into a fibrous mass. The 
untreated disease is progressive, but the course is slow and the 
symptoms may extend over 12 to 15 years, death from asthenia 
or tuberculosis being the most frequent ending. (2) Symptoms 
similar to the above may follow complete removal of the thyroid 
gland. Kocher of Bern found that, in the total removal of the 
gland by operation, out of 408 cases operative myxoedema 
occurred in 60, but it is thought that if a small portion of the 
gland is left, or if accessory glands are present, these symptoms 
will not develop. The treatment of myxoedema is similar to 
that of cretinism. 

MYZOSTOMIDA, a remarkahle group of small parasitic 
worms which live on crinoid echinoderms; they were first dis- 
covered by Leuckart in 1827. Some species, such as Myzosloma 
cirriferum, move about on the host; others, such as M. glabrum, 
remain stationary with the pharynx inserted in the mouth of the 
crinoid. M, deformator gives rise to a " gall " on the arm of the 
host, one joint of the pinnule growing round the worm so as to 
enclose it in a cyst (see fig. E) ; whilst M. pulvinar lives actually 
in the alimentary canal of a species of Anledon. 

A typical myzostomid (see A, B, C) is of a flattened t rounded 
shape, with a thin edge drawn out into delicate radiating cirri. 
The skin is ciliated. The dorsal surface is smooth; ventrally there 
are five pairs of parapodia, armed with supporting and hooked 
setae, by means 01 which the worm adheres to its Host. Beyond 
the parapodia are four pairs of organs, often called suckers, but 
probably of sensory nature, and comparable to the lateral sense 
organs of Capitellids (Wheeler). The mouth and cloacal aperture 
are generally at opposite ends of the ventral surface. The former 
leads to a protrusible pharynx (B), from which the oesophagus 
opens into a wide intestinal chamber with branching lateral diver- 
ticula. There appears to be no vascular system. The nervous 
system consists of a circumoesophageal nerve, with scarcely differ- 
entiated brain, joining below a large ganglionic mass no doubt 
representing many fused ganglia (B). The dorsoventral and. the 
parapodial muscles are much developed, whilst the coelom is re- 
duced mostly to branched spaces in which the genital produces 
ripen. Full-grown myzostomids are hermaphrodite. The^ male 
organ (C) consists of a branched sac opening to the exterior on 
each side. The paired ovaries discharge their products into a 
median coelemic chamber with lateral branches (C), olten called 
the uterus, from which the ripe ova are discharged by a median 
dorsal pore into the terminal region of the rectum (cloaca). Into 
this same cloacal chamber open ventrally a pair of ciliated tubes 
communicating by funnels with the coelom (Nansen and Wheeler) ; 
these are possibly nephridia, and excretory in function. 

The Myzostomida are protandric hermaphrodites, being 
functional males when small, nermaphrodite later, and finally

functional females (Wheeler). Small "males" are in some 
species constantly associated with large hermaphrodites, but 
according to Beard there are in some cases true dwarf males, 
comparable to the complementary males described by Darwin 
in the Cirripedia. The embryology of Myzostoma has been

studied by Metchnikoff and Beard. Cleavage leads to the 
formation of an epibolic gastrula and ciliated embryo which 
hatches as a free-swimming larva remarkably like that of a 
Polychaete worm (D). The larva is provided with postoral 
and perianal ciliated bands, and on either side with a bunch of 



long provisional setae. The mesoderm becomes segmented, 
and the parapodia subsequently develop from before backwards; 
but almost all internal traces of segmentation are lost in the 
adult. The structure and development of the Myzostomida 
seem to show that they are nearly related to Polychaeta (see 
Chaetopoda), though highly modified in relation to their 
parasitic mode of life.

MZABITES, or Beni-Mzab, a .confederation of Berber tribes, 
now under the direct authority of France. Of all the Berber 
peoples the Mzabites have remained freest from foreign admix- 
ture. Their own country is a region of the Algerian Sahara, 
about 100 m. south of El-Aghuat. It consists of five oases close 
together, viz. Ghardaia, Beni-Isguen, El-Ateuf, Melika and 
Bu Nura, and two isolated oases farther north, Berrian and 
Guerrara. The total population numbered at the 1906 census 
45,996, of whom about 100 were Europeans and a very small 
proportion Arabs and Jews. The Mzabites are of small and 
slender figure, with very short necks and under-developed legs. 
Their faces are flat, with short nose, thick lips and very deep-set 
eyes, and their complexion pale. Their dress is a shirt of thick 
wool, usually many-coloured. They are agriculturists, and are 
also famed as traders. The butchers, fruiterers, bath-house 
keepers, road-sweepers and carriers of the African littoral from 
Tangier to. Tripoli are nearly all Mzabites. Their industries, too, 
are highly organized. The Mzabite burnouses and carpets are 
found throughout North Africa. Their commercial honesty is 
proverbial. Nearly all read and write Arabic, though in talking 
among themselves they use the Zenata dialect of the Berber 
language, for which, in common with other Berber peoples, 
they have no written form surviving. They are Mahomme- 
dans, of the Ibadite sect, and are regarded as heretics by the 
Sunnites. 

According to tradition the Ibadites, after their overthrow at 
Tiaret by the Fatimites, took refuge during the 10th century 
in the country to the south-west of Wargla, where they founded 
an independent state. In 1012, owing to further persecutions, 
they fled to their present quarters, where they long remained 
invulnerable. After the capture of El-Aghuat by the French, 
the Mzabites concluded with the Algerian government, in 1853, 
a convention by which they engaged to pay an annual con- 
tribution of £1800 in return for their independence. In Novem- 
ber 1882 the Mzab country was definitely annexed to Algeria. 
Ghardaia (pop. 7868) is the capital of the confederation, and 
next in importance is Beni-Isguen (4916), the chief commercial 
centre. Since the establishment of French control, Beni-Isguen 
has become the d£p6t for the sale of European goods. French 
engineers have rendered the oases much more fertile than they 
used to be by a system of irrigation works. (See also Algeria.)

N— NABATAEANS 



NA letter which regularly follows M in the alphabet, and, 
like it in its early forms has the first limb longer than 
the others; thus, written from right to left, V\. The 
Semitic languages gradually diminish the size of the 
other two limbs, while the Greek and Latin alphabets tend to 
make all three of equal length. The earliest name of the symbol 
was Nutty whence comes the Greek ny (vv). The sound of n 
varies according to the point at which the contact of the tongue 
with the roof of the mouth is made; it may be dental, alveolar, 
palatal or guttural. In Sanskrit these four sounds are dis- 
tinguished by different symbols; the last two occur in com- 
bination with stops or affricates of the same series. The French 
or German n when standing by itself is dental, the English 
alveolar, i.e. pronounced like the English t and d against the 
sockets of the teeth instead of the teeth themselves. The guttural 
nasal is written in English ng as in ring; for# the palatal n as 
in lynch there is no separate symbol. The sound of n stands in the 
same relation to d as m stands to b; both are ordinarily voiced 
and the mouth position for both is the same, but in pronouncing 
n the nasal passage is left open, so that the sound of n can be 
continued while that of d cannot. This is best observed by 
pronouncing syllables where the consonant comes last as in and 
id. When the nasal passage is closed, as when one has a bad cold, 
m and n cannot be pronounced; attempts to pronounce moon 
result only in hood. Two important points arise in connexion 
with nasals: (1) sonant nasals, (2) nasalization of vowels. The 
discovery of sonant nasals by Dr Karl Brugman in 1876 (Curtius, 
Studien, 9, pp. 285-338) explained many facts of language which 
had been hitherto obscure and elucidated many difficulties in 
the Indo-European vowel system. It had been observed, for ex- 
ample, that the same original negative prefix was represented in 
Sanskrit by a, Greek by a, in Latin by in and in Germanic by «w, 
and these differences had not been accounted for satisfactorily. 
Dr Brugman argued that in these and similar cases the syllable 
was made by the consonant alone, and the nasal so used was 
termed a sonant nasal and written n. In most cases Sanskrit 
and Greek lost the nasal sound altogether and replaced it by a 
vowel a, a, while in Latin and Germanic a vowel was developed 
independently before the nasal. In the accusative singular of 
consonant stems Sans, padam, Gr. ir65a, Lat. pedem, Sanskrit 
and Greek did not, as generally, agree, but it was shown that 
in such cases there were originally two forms according to the 
nature of the sound beginning the next word in the sentence. 
Thus an original Indo-European *pedm } would not be treated 
precisely in the same way if the next word began with a vowel 
as it would when a consonant followed. Sanskrit had adopted 
the form used before vowels, Greek the form before consonants 
and each had dropped the alternative form. The second point — 
the nasalizing of vowels — is difficult for an Englishman to under- 
stand or to produce, as the sounds do not exist in his language. 
Thus in learning to pronounce French he tends to replace the 
nasalized vowels by the nearest sounds in English, making 
the Fr. on a nasalized vowel (0), into Eng. ong, a vowel 
followed by a guttural consonant. The nasalized vowels are 
produced by drawing forward the uvula, the " tab " at the end 
of the soft palate, so that the breath escapes through the nose as 
well as the mouth. In the French nasalized vowels, however, 
many phoneticians hold that, besides the leaving of the nasal 
passage open, there is a change in the position of the tongue in 
passing from a to a. The nasalized vowels are generally written 
with a hook below, upon the analogy of the transliteration of 
such sounds in the Slavonic languages, but as the same symbol is 
often used to distinguish an " open " vowel from a " close " one, 
the use is not without ambiguity. On the other hand, it is not 
admissible to write a for the nasalized vowel in languages which 
have accent signs, e.g. Lithuanian. It is possible to nasalize 
some consonants as well as vowels; nasalized spirants play an 



important part in the so-called " Yankee " pronunciation of 
Americans. (P. Gi.) 

NAAS (pron. Nace, as in place), a market town of Co. 
Kildare, Ireland, 20 m, S.W. from Dublin on branches of the 
Great Southern and Western railway and of the Grand Canal. 
Pop. (1901) 3836. It is situated among the foothills of the 
Wicklow Mountains, close to the river Liffey. The town is of 
great antiquity, and was a residence of the kings of Leinster, the 
place of whose assemblies is marked by a neighbouring rath or 
mound. Naas returned two members to the Irish parliament 
from 1559 until the union in 1800. Of a castle taken by Cromwell 
in 1650, and of several former abbeys, there are no remains.

NABATAEANS, a people of ancient Arabia, whose settlements 
in the time of Josephus (AnL i. 12. 4; comp. Jerome, Quaest. 
in Gen. xxv.) gave the name of Nabatene to the border-land 
between Syria and Arabia from the Euphrates to the Red Sea. 
Josephus suggests, and Jerome, apparently following him, 
affirms, that the name is identical with that of the Ishmaelite 
tribe of Nebaioth (Gen. xxv. 13; Isa. lx. 7), which in later Old 
Testament times had a leading place among the northern Arabs, 
and is associated with Kedar (Isa. lx. 7) much as Pliny v. n (12) 
associates Nabataei and Cedrei. The identification is rendered 
uncertain by the fact that the name Nabataean is properly 
spelled with t not t (on the inscriptions, cf. also Arabic Nabotj 
NabUy &c.) . Thus the history of the Nabataeans cannot certainly 
be carried back beyond 312 B.C., at which date they were attacked 
without success by Antigonus I. Cyclops in their mountain 
fortress of Petra. They are described by Diodorus (xix. 94 seq.) 
as being at this time a strong tribe of some 10,000 warriors, 
pre-eminent among the nomadic Arabs, eschewing agriculture, 
fixed houses and the use of wine, but adding to pastoral pursuits 
a profitable trade with the seaports in myrrh and spices from 
Arabia Felix, as well as a trade with Egypt in bitumen from 
the Dead Sea. Their arid country was the best safeguard of their 
cherished liberty; for the bottle-shaped cisterns for rain-water 
which they excavated in the rocky or argillaceous soil were 
carefully concealed from invaders. Petra (q.v.) or Sela* was the 
ancient capital of Edom; the Nabataeans must have occupied 
the old Edomite country, and succeeded to its commerce, after 
the Edomites took advantage of the Babylonian captivity to 
press forward into southern Judaea. 1 This migration, the date 
of which cannot be determined, also made them masters of the 
shores of the Gulf of *Akaba and the important harbour of 
Elath. Here, according to Agatharchides (Geog. Gr. Min. t i. 
178), they were for a time very troublesome, as wreckers 
and pirates, to the reopened commerce between Egypt and 
the East, till they were chastised by the Greek sovereigns of 
Alexandria. 

The Nabataeans had already some tincture of foreign culture 
when they first appear in history. That culture was naturally 
Aramaic; they wrote a letter to Antigonus " in Syriac letters," 
and Aramaic continued to be the language of their coins and 
inscriptions when the tribe grew into a kingdom, and profited 
by the decay of the Seleucids to extend its borders northward 
over the more fertile country east of the Jordan. They occupied 
IJauran, and about 85 B.C. their king Aretas (JJaritha) 
became lord of Damascus and Coele-Syria. Allies of the first 
Hasmonaeans in their struggles against the Greeks (1 Mace, 
v. 25, ix. 35; 2 Mace. v. 8), they became the rivals of the Judaean 
dynasty in the period of its splendour, and a chief element in 
the disorders which invited Pompey's intervention in Palestine. 
The Roman arms were not very successful, and King Aretas 
retained his whole possessions, including Damascus, as a Roman 

1 See Edom, and (for the view that Mai. i. 1-5, refers to the 
expulsion of Edomites from their land) Malachi.

vassal. 1 As " allies " of the Romans the Nabataeans continued to 
flourish throughout the first Christian century. Their power 
extended far into Arabia, particularly along the Red Sea; and 
Petra was a meeting-place of many nations, though its commerce 
was diminished by the rise of the Eastern trade-route from 
Myoshormus to Coptos on the Nile. Under the Roman peace 
they lost their warlike and nomadic habits, and were a sober, 
acquisitive, orderly people, wholly intent on trade and agri- 
culture (Strabo xvi. 4). They might have long been a bulwark 
between Rome and the wild hordes of the desert but for the^short- 
sighted cupidity of Trajan, who reduced Petra and broke up the 
Nabataean nationality (105 a.d.). The new Arab invaders who 
soon pressed forward into their seats found the remnants of the 
Nabataeans transformed into felldhin, and speaking Aramaic 
like their neighbours. Hence Nabataeans became the Arabic 
name for Aramaeans, whether in Syria or Irak, a fact which has 
been incorrectly held to prove that the Nabataeans were origin- 
ally Aramaean immigrants from Babylonia. It is now known, 
however, that they were true Arabs — as the proper names on their 
inscriptions show — who had come under Aramaic influence. 

See especially on this last point (against Quatremere, Journ. 
asiat. xv. , vol. ii., 1835), Noldeke in Zeit. d. morgentdnd. GeselL 
xvii. 705 seq M xxv. 122 seq. The so-called " Nabataean Agriculture " 
(Faldha Nabafiya), which professes to be an Arabic translation by 
Ibn Wahshiya from an ancient Nabataean source, is a forgery of 
the 10th century (see A. von Gutschmid, Z. d, mordent. Ges. xv. 
1 seq.; Noldeke, ib. xxix. 445 seq.). Complete bibliographical 
information is given by E. Schiirer in his sketch of Nabataean

NABBES, THOMAS (b. 1605), English dramatist, was born in 
humble circumstances in Worcestershire. He entered Exeter 
College, Oxford, in 1621, but left the university without taking a 
degree, and about 1630 began a career in London as a dramatist. 
His works include: Covent Garden (acted 1633, printed 1638), 
a prose comedy of small merit; Tottenham Court (acted 1634, 
printed 1638), a comedy the scene of which is laid in a holiday 
resort of the London tradesmen; Hannibal and Scipio (acted 
1635, printed 1637), a historical tragedy; The Bride (1638), a 
comedy; The Unfortunate Mother (1640), an unacted tragedy; 
Microcosmus, a Morall Maske (printed 1637) ; two other masques, 
Spring's Glory and Presentation intended for the Prince his 
Highnesse on his Birthday (printed together in 1638); and a 
continuation of Richard Knolles's Generall Historie of the Turkes 
(1638). His verse is smooth and musical, and if his language 
is sometimes coarse, his general attitude is moral. The masque 
of Microcosmus — really a morab'ty play, in which Physander 
after much error is reunited to his wife Bellanima, who personifies 
the soul — is admirable in its own kind, and the other two masques, 
slighter in construction but ingenious, show Nabbes at his best. 

Nabbes's plays were collected in 1639; and Microcosmus was 
printed in Dodsley's Old Plays (1744). All his works, with the 
exception of his continuation of Knolles's history, were reprinted 
by A. H. Bullen in his Old English Plays (second series, 1887).

NABHA, a native state of India, within the Punjab. Area, 
966 sq. m. Pop. (1901) 297,949. Its territories are scattered; 
one section, divided into twelve separate tracts, lies among the 
territories of Patiala and Jind, in the east and south of the 
Punjab; the other section is in the extreme south-east. The 
whole of the territories belong physically to a plain; but they 
vary in character from the great fertility of the Pawadh region 
to the aridity of the Rajputana desert. Nabha is one of the Sikh

mentioned reigned from 9 B.C. to a.d. 40. 



states, founded by a member of the Phulkian family, which estab- 
lished its independence about 1763. The first relations of the 
state with the British were in 1 807-1808, when the raja obtained 
protection against the threatened encroachments of Ranjit 
Singh. During the Mutiny in 1857 the raja showed distinguished 
loyalty, and was rewarded by grants of territory to the value of 
over £10,000. The imperial service troops of the raja Hira 
Singh (b. c. 1843; succeeded m l8 7 T ) did good service during the 
Tirah campaign of 1897-98. The chief products of the state are 
wheat, millets, pulses, cotton and sugar. The estimated gross 
revenue is £100,000;' no tribute is paid. The territory is crossed 
by the main line and also by several branches of the North- 
western railway, and is irrigated by the Sirhind canal. 

The town of Nabha, founded in 1755, has a station on the 
Rajpura-Bhatinda branch of the North-Western railway. Pop. 
(1901) 18,468.

NABIGHA DHUBYANl [Ziyad ibn Mu'awlyya] (6th and 7th 
centuries), Arabian poet, was one of the last poets of pre-Islamic 
times. His tribe, the Bani Dhubyan, belonged to the district near 
Mecca, but he himself spent most of his time at the courts of 
Hira and Ghassan. In Hira he remained under Mondhir (Mund- 
hir) III., and under his successor in 562. After a sojourn at the 
court of Ghassan, he returned to Hira under Nu'man. He was, 
however, compelled to flee to Ghassan, owing to some verses 
he had written on the queen, but returned again about 600. 
When Nu*man died some five years later he withdrew to his own 
tribe. The date of his death is uncertain, but he does not seem 
to have known Islam. His poems consist largely of eulogies and 
satires, and are concerned with the strife of Hira and Ghassan, 
and of the Bani Abs and the Bani Dhubyan. He is one of the 
six eminent pre-Islamic poets whose poems were collected before 
the middle of the 2nd century of Islam, and have been regarded 
as the standard of Arabian poetry. Some writers consider him 
the first of the six. 

His poems have been edited by W. Ahlwardt in the Diwans of the 
six ancient Arabic Poets (London, 1870), and separately by H. 
Derenbourg (Paris, 1869, a reprint from the Journal asiatique for 
1868). (G.W.T.) 

NABOB, a corruption of the Hindostani nawab, originally used 
for native rulers. In the 18th century, when Clive's victories 
made Indian terms familiar in England, it began to be applied 
to Anglo-Indians who returned with fortunes from the East. 

NABUA, a town in the extreme S. of the province of Ambos 
Camarines, Luzon, Philippine Islands, on the Bicol river, about 
22 m. S.S.E. of Nueva Caceres, the capital. Pop. (1903) 18,893. 
Nabua is in the district known as La Rinconada — a name 
originally given to it on account of its inaccessibility. It is 
connected by road, railway and the Bicol river (navigable for 
light-draft boats) with Nueva Caceres. Nabua is the centre of 
an agricultural region, which produces much rice and some 
Indian corn, sugar and pepper. The language is Bicol. 

NACAIRE, Naker, Naquaire (Arab, naqara), the medieval 
name for the kettledrum, the earliest representation of which 
appears in the unique MS. kuown as the Vienna Genesis (5th or 
6th century). The nacaire was, according to Froissart, among the 
instruments used at the triumphal entry of Edward III. into 
Calais. The Chronicles of Joinville describe the instrument as 
a kind of drum: " Lor il fist sonner les tabours que Y on appelle 
nacaires." Chaucer, in his description of the tournament in the 
Knight's Tale, line 1653, also refers to this early kettledrum. 

NACHMANIDES (Na^manides), the usual name of Moses 
ben Nahman (known also as Ramban), Jewish scholar, was born 
in Gerona in 1194 and died in Palestine c. 1270. His chief work, 
the Commentary on the Pentateuch, is distinguished by originality 
and charm. The author was a mystic as well as a philologist, 
and his works unite with peculiar harmony the qualities of reason 
and feeling. He was also a Talmudist of high repute, and wrote 
glosses on various Tractates, Responsa and other legal works. 
Though not a philosopher, he was drawn into the controversy 
that arose over the scholastic method of Maimonides (q.v.). 
He endeavoured to steer a middle course between the worshippers 



148 



NACHOD— NADIA 



and the excommunicators of Maimonides, but he did not succeed 
in healing the breach. His homiletic books, Epistle on Sanctity 
{Iggereth ha-qodesh) and Law of Man (Torath ha- Adam), which 
deal respectively with the sanctity of marriage and the solemnity 
of death, are full of intense spirituality, while at the same time 
treating of ritual customs — a combination which shows essential 
Rabbinism at its best. He occupies an important position in the 
history of the acceptance by medieval Jews of the Kabbala 
(q.v.); for, though he made no fresh contributions to the philo- 
sophy of mysticism, the fact that this famous rabbi was himself 
a mystic induced a favourable attitude in many who would other- 
wise have rejected mysticism as Maimonides did. In 1263 
Nahmanides was forced to enter into a public disputation with 
a Jewish-Christian, Pablo Christiani, in the presence of King 
James of Aragon. Though Nachmanides was assured that 
perfect freedom of speech was conceded to him, his defence was 
pronounced blasphemous and he was banished for life. In 1267 
he went to Palestine and settled at Acre. He died about 1270.

and xvii.). (I. A.) 

NACHOD, a town of Bohemia, Austria, 109 m. E.N.E. of 
Prague by rail. Pop. (1900) 9899, mostly Czech. It is situated 
on the Mettau river, at the entrance of the Lewin-Nachod pass. 
The old castle contains a collection of historical paintings and 
archives, and there are several old churches, of which that of 
St Lawrence is mentioned as the parish church in 1350. The 
town originally gathered round the castle of Nachod, of which 
the first lord was a member of the powerful family of Hron, 
in the middle of the 13th century. It suffered much during the 
Hussite Wars, and in 1437 was captured by the celebrated robber 
knight Kolda of Zampach, and retaken by George of Podebrad 
in 1456 and included in his estates. It was sold in 1623, and in 
1634 given to Ottavio Piccolomini; finally, after many changes 
of ownership, the castle and titular lordship came in 1840 to 
the princes of Schaumburg-Lippe. The important engagements 
fought near the town on the 27th and 28th of June 1866 opened 
Bohemia to the victorious Prussians. 

NACHTIGAL, GUSTAV (1834-1885), German explorer in 
Central Africa, son of a Lutheran pastor, was born at Eichstedt 
in the Mark of Brandenburg, on the 23rd of February 1834. 
After medical study at the universities of Halle, Wiirzburg 
and Greifswald, he practised for a few years as a military 
surgeon. Finding the climate of his native country injurious 
to his health, he went to Algiers and Tunis, and took part, as a 
surgeon, in several expeditions into the interior. Commissioned 
by the king of Prussia to carry gifts to the sultan of Bornu in 
acknowledgment of kindness shown to German travellers, he 
set out in 1869 from Tripoli, and succeeded after two years' 
journeyings in accomplishing his mission. During this period 
he visited Tibesti and Borku, regions of the central Sahara 
not previously known to Europeans. From Bornu he went 
to Bagirmi, and, proceeding by way of Wadai and Kordofan, 
emerged from darkest Africa, after having been given up for 
lost, at Khartum in the winter of 1874. His journey, graphically 
described in his Sahara und Sudan (3 vols., 1870-1889), placed 
the intrepid explorer in the front rank of discoverers. On the 
establishment of a protectorate over Tunisia by France, Nachtigal 
was sent thither as consul-general for the German empire, and 
remained there until 18S4, when he was despatched by Prince 
Bismarck to West Africa as special commissioner, ostensibly 
to inquire into the condition of German commerce, but really 
to annex territories to the German flag. As the result of his 
mission Togoland and Cameroon were added to the German 
empire. On his return voyage he died at sea off Cape Palmas 
on the 20th of April 1885, and was buried at Grand Bassam. 

'NachtigaVs travels are summarized in Gttstav NachtigaVs Reisen

A French translation, by J. van Vollenhoven, of that part of his 
work concerning Wadai, appeared in the Bull, du comiti de VAfriq. 
franqaise for 1903 under tne title of (( Le Voyage de Nachtigal au 
Ouadai." Nachtigal died before transcribing his notes on Wadai, 
and they were edited in the German edition by E. Groddeck. 



NADASDY, TAMAS L, Count, called the great palatine 
(1498-1562), Hungarian statesman, was the son of Francis I. 
Nadasdy and was educated at Graz, Bologna and Rome. In 
1 521 he accompanied Cardinal Cajetan (whom the pope had sent 
to Hungary to preach a crusade against the Turks) to Buda as 
his interpreter. In 1525 he became a member of the council of 
state and was sent by King Louis II. to the diet of Spires to ask 
for help in the imminent Turkish war. During his absence the 
Mohacs catastrophe took place, and Nadasdy only returned 
to Hungary in time to escort the queen-widow from Komarom 
to Pressburg. He was sent to offer the Hungarian crown to 
the archduke Ferdinand, and on his coronation (Nov. 3rd, 1527) 
was made commandant of Buda. On the capture of Buda by 
Suleiman the Magnificent, Nadasdy went over to John Zapolya. 
In 1530 he successfully defended Buda against the imperialists. 
In 1533 his jealousy of the dominant influence of Ludovic 
Gritti caused him to desert John for Ferdinand, to whom he 
afterwards remained faithful. He was endowed with enormous 
estates by the emperor,* and from 1537 onwards became 
Ferdinand's secret but most influential counsellor. Subsequently, 
as ban of Croatia-Slavonia, he valiantly defended that border 
province against the Turks. He did his utmost to promote 
education, and the school which he founded at tJj-Sziget, where 
he also set up a printing-press, received a warm eulogy from 
Philip Melanchthon. In 1 540 Nadasdy was appointed grand- 
justiciar; in 1547 he presided over the diet of Nagyszombat, 
and finally,in 1559, was elected palatine by the diet of Pressburg. 
In his declining years he aided the heroic Mikl6s Zrinyi against 
the Turks.

NADEN, CONSTANCE CAROLINE WOODHILL (1858-1889), 
English author, was born at Edgbaston, on the 24th of January 
1858, her father being an architect. Her mother died just after 
the child's birth, and Constance was brought up in the home of 
her grandfather. In 1881 she began to study physical science 
at Mason College, Birmingham. In 1881 she published Songs 
and Sonnets of Springtime; in 1887, A Modern Apostle, and other 
Poems. Her poems made such an impression on W. E. Gladstone 
that he included her, in an article in the Speaker, among the fore- 
most English poetesses of the day. After her grandfather's 
death Miss Naden found herself rich, and she travelled in the 
East and then (1888) settled in London. She died on the 23rd 
of December 1889. After 1876 she had paid increasing attention 
to philosophy, with her friend Dr Robert Lewins, and the two 
had formulated a system of their own, which they called " Hylo- 
Idealism." Her main ideas on the subject are contained in a 
posthumous volume of her essays (Induction and Deduction, 
1890), edited by Dr Lewins. 

NADIA, or Nuddea, a district of British India, in the 
Presidency division of Bengal. The administrative head- 
quarters are at Krishnagar. Area, 2793 sq. m.; pop. (1901) 
1,667,491. It is a district of great rivers. Standing at the head 
of the Gangetic delta, its alluvial surface, though still liable to 
periodical inundation, has been raised by ancient deposits of 
silt sufficiently high to be permanent dry land. Along the entire 
north-eastern boundary flows the main stream of the Ganges 
or Padma, of which all the remaining rivers of the district 
are offshoots. The Bhagirathi on the eastern border, and the 
Jalangi and the Matabhanga meandering through the centre 
of the district, are the chief of those offshoots, called distinctively 
the " Nadia rivers." But the whole surface of the country 
is interlaced with a network of minor streams, communicating 
with one another by side channels. All the rivers are navigable 
in the rainy season for boats of the largest burthen, but during 
the rest of the year they dwindle down to shallow streams, With 
dangerous sandbanks and bars. In former times the Nadia 
rivers afforded the regular means of communication between 
the upper valley of the Ganges and the seaboard; and much 
of the trade of the district still comes down to Calcutta by this 
route during the height of the rainy season. But the railways, 



NADIM— NAEVIUS

with the main stream of the Ganges and the Sundarbans route, 
now carry by far the larger portion of the traffic. Rice is the 
staple crop; but the district is not as a whole fertile, the soil 
being sandy and the methods of cultivation backward. It is 
traversed by the main line and also by several branches of the 
Eastern Bengal railway. The battlefield of Plassey was situated 
in this district, but the floods of the Bhagirathi have washed 
away some part of it. 

Nadia or Nabadwip, an ancient capital of Bengal, was formerly 
situated on the east bank of the Bhagirathi, which has since 
changed its course. Pop. (1901) 10,880. It is celebrated for 
the sanctity and learning of its pundits, and as the birthplace 
of Chaitanya, the Vaishnav reformer of the 16th century. Its 
Sanskrit schools, called tols, are well known and of ancient 
foundation. 

NADlM [Abulfaraj Mahommed ibn Ishaq ibn abl Ya'qub 
un-Nadim] (d. 995), of Bagdad, the author of one of the most 
interesting works in Arabic literature, the Fihrist id- % Ulum 
(" list of the books of all nations that were to be found in Arabic ") 
with notices of the authors and other particulars, carried down 
to the year 988. A note In the Leiden MS. places the death of 
the author eight years later. Of his life we know nothing. His 
work gives us a complete picture of the most active intellectual 
period of the Arabian empire. He traces the rise and growth of 
philology and belles-lettres, of theology, orthodox and heretical, 
of law and history, of mathematics and astronomy, of medicine 
and alchemy; he does not despise the histories of knights errant, 
the fables of Kalila and Dimna, the facetiae of the " boon com- 
panions," the works of magic and divination. But to us no 
part of his work is more interesting than his account of the 
beliefs of sects and peoples beyond Islam. Here, fortunately, 
still more than in other parts of his work, he goes heyond the 
functions of the mere cataloguer; he tells what he learned of 
China from a Christian missionary of Nejran, of India from a de- 
scription of its religion compiled for the Barmecide Yahya; his full 
accounts of the Sabians of Harran and of the doctrines of Mani 
are of the first importance for the historian of Asiatic religions. 

Imperfect manuscripts of the Fihrist exist in Paris, Leiden and 
Vienna. The text was prepared for publication by G. Fliigel, and 
edited after his death by J. RSdiger and A. Miiller (2 vols., Leipzig, 
1871-1872). Fliigel had already ^ given a full analysis of the work 
in the Journal of the German Oriental Society, vol. xiii. (1859), pp. 
559-650; cf. E. G. Browne, A Literary History of Persia (London, 
1902), pp. 383-387. T. Houtsma supplied a lacuna in Flugel f s 
edition in the Vienna Oriental Journal, vol. iv. pp. 217 sqq. 

NADIR (Arabic naftr, " opposite to," used elliptically for 
nafir-es-semt, " opposite to the zenith ") , a term used in astronomy 
for the point in the heavens exactly opposite to the zenith, the 
zenith and nadir being the two poles of the horizon. It is thus 
used figuratively of the lowest depth of a person's spirits or the 
lowest point in a career. 

NAEGELI, KARL WILHELM VON (1817-1891), Swiss 
botanist, was bora on the 27th of March 1817 near Zurich. He 
studied botany under A. P. de Candolle at Geneva, and graduated 
with a botanical thesis at Zurich in 1840. His attention having 
been directed by M. J. Schleiden, then professor of botany at 
Jena, to the microscopical study of plants, he engaged more 
particularly in that branch of research. Soon after graduation 
he became Privat dozent and subsequently professor extra- 
ordinary, in the university of Zurich; in 1852 he was called 
to fill the chair of botany in the university of Freiburg-in- 
Breisgau; and in 1857 he was promoted to Munich, where he 
remained as professor until his death on the nth of May 1891. 
Among his more important contributions to science were a series 
of papers in the Zeiischrift filr wissenschaftlicke Botanik (1844- 
1846); Die neuern Algensystetne (1847); Gattungen einzelliger 
A I gen ( 1 849) ; Pflanzenphysiologische U titer suchungen (1855- 
1858), with C. E. Cramer; Bcitr&gc zur wisscnschaftlichen 
Botanik (1858-1868); a number of papers contributed to the 
Royal Bavarian Academy of Sciences, forming three volumes of 
Botanische Mitteilungen (1861-1881); and, finally, his volume, 
Meehanisch-physiologische Theorie der Abstammungslehre t pub- 
lished in 1884. 



The more striking of his many and varied discoveries are embodied 
in the Zeitsch.fur wiss. BoL In this we begin with Naegeli's extension 
of Robert Brown's discovery of the nucleus to the principal families 
of Cryptogams, and the assertion of its universal occurrence in plants, 
together with the recognition of its vesicular structure. There is 
further his investigation of the " mucous layer " (Schleimschicht) 
lining the wall of all normal cells, where he shows that it consists of 
granular " mucus," which, at an earlier stage, filled the cell-cayitv, 
and which differs chemically from the cell-wall in that it is nitro- 
genous. This layer he proved to be never absent from living cells — 
to be, in fact, itself the living part of the cell, a discovery which was 
simultaneously (1846) made by Hugo von Mohl (1 805-1 872), who 

fave to the living matter of the plant-body the name " protoplasm." 
n connexion with these discoveries, Naegeli controverted Schleiden f s 
view of the universality of free-cell-formation as the mode of cell- 
multiplication, and showed that in the vegetative organs, at least, 
new cells are formed by division. In the Zeiischrift, too, is Naegeli's 
most important algological work — such as the paper on Caulerpa, 
which brought to Tight the remarkable unseptate structure of the 
Siphoneae, and his research on Delesseria, which _ resulted in the 
discovery of growth by a single apical cell. ^ This discovery led 
Naegeli on to the study of the growing-point in other plants. He 
consequently gave the first accurate account of the apical cell, and 
of the mode of growth of the stem in various Mosses and Liverworts. 
Subsequently he observed that in Lycopodium and in Angiosperms 
the growing-point has no apical cell, but consists of a small-celled 
meristem, in which the first differentiation of the permanent tissues 
can be traced. One of the most remarkable discoveries recorded in 
the Zeiischrift is that of the antheridia and spermatozoids of Ferns 
and of Pilularia. The Beitrage zur wiss. Botanik consists almost 
entirely of researches into the anatomy of vascular plants, while 
the main feature of the Pflanzenphysiologische Unter suchungen is 
the exhaustive work on the structure, development and various 
forms of starch-grains. The Botanische Mitteilungen include^ a 
number of papers in all departments of botany, many of them being 
continuations and extensions of his earlier work. In his Theorie der 
Abstammungstehre Naegeli introduced the idea of a definite material 
basis for heredity; the substance he termed " idioplasm." Hjs 
theory of evolution is that the idioplasm of any one generation is 
not identical with that of either its progenitors or its progeny: 
it is always increasing in complexity, with the result that each succes- 
sive generation marks an advance upon its oredecessor. Hence 
variation takes place determinately, and in the higher direction only; 
while variability is the result of internal causes, and natural selection 
plays but a small part in evolution. Whereas, on the Darwinian 
theory, all organization is adaptive, according to Naegeli the develop- 
ment of higher organization is the outcome of the spontaneous 
evolution of the idioplasm. 

More detailed accounts of Naegeli's life and work are to be found 
in Nature^ 16th October 1891, and in Proc. Roy. Soc. f vol. li.

NAESTVED, a town of Denmark, in the ami (county) of 
Praesto, near the S.W. coast of Zealand, 59 m. by rail S.W. of 
Copenhagen. Pop. (1901) 7162. From 1140 to the Reformation 
it was one of the most important towns of the kingdom, though 
dependent upon the monastery of St Peter (founded here in 
H3S)- North of the town (i£ m.) lies Herlufsholm, where 
Admiral Herluf Trolle founded a Latin school in 1567, still 
extant. 

NAEVIUS, GNAEUS (c. 264-? 194 B.C.), Latin epic poet and 
dramatist. There is great uncertainty in regard to his life. 
From the expression of Gellius (i. 24. 1) characterizing his 
epitaph as written in a vein of " Campanian arrogance " it has 
been inferred that he was born in one of the Latin communities 
settled in Campania. But the phrase " Campanian arrogance " 
seems to have been used proverbially for "gasconade"; and, 
as there was a plebeian gens Naevia in Rome, it is quite as 
probable that he was by birth a Roman citizen. He served either 
in the Roman army or among the socii in the first Punic War, 
and thus must have reached manhood before 241. His career 
as a dramatic author began with the exhibition of a drama in 
or about the year 235, and continued for thirty years. Towards 
the close he incurred the hostility of some of the nobility, espe- 
cially, it is said, of the Metelli, by the attacks which he made 
upon them on the stage, and at their instance he was imprisoned 
(Plautus, Mil. Glor. 211). After writing two plays during his 
imprisonment, in which he is said to have apologized for his 
former rudeness (Gellius iii. 3. 15), he was liberated through the 
interference of the tribunes of the commons; but he had shortly 
afterwards to retire from Rome (in or about 204) to Utica. 
It may have been during his exile, when withdrawn from his 
active career as a dramatist, that he composed or completed his 



i5° 



NAEVUS— NAG A HILLS 



poem on the first Punic war. Probably his latest composition 
was the epitaph already referred to, written like the epic in 
Saturnian verse: — 

" Immortales mortalcs si foret fas flere, 
Flerent divae Camenae Naevium poetam; 
Itaque postquam est Orci traditus thesauro 
Obhti sunt Romai loquier lingua Latina." * 

If these lines were dictated by a jealousy of the growing ascend- 
ancy of Ennius, the life of Naevius must have been prolonged 
considerably beyond 204, the year in which Ennius began his 
career as an author in Rome. As distinguished from Livius 
Andronicus, Naevius was a native Italian, not a Greek; he was 
also an original writer, not a mere adapter or translator. If it 
was due to Livius that the forms of Latin literature were, from 
the first, moulded on those of Greek literature, it was due to 
Naevius that much of its spirit and substance was of native 
growth. 

Like Livius, Naevius professed to adapt Greek tragedies and 
comedies to the Roman stage. Among the titles of his tragedies are 
Aegisthus, Lycurgus, Andromache or Hector Projiciscens, Equus 
Trojanus, the last named being performed at the opening of Pompey's 
theatre (55). The national cast of his genius and temper was shown 
by his deviating from his Greek originals, and producing at least 
two specimens of the fabula praetexta (national drama) one founded 
on the childhood of Romulus and Remus {Lupus or Alimonium 
Romuli et Remi), the other called Clastidium, which celebrated the 
victory of M. Claudius Marcellus over the Celts (222). But it was. 
as a writer of comedy that he was most famous, most productive 
and most original. While he is never ranked as a writer of tragedy 
with Ennius, Pacuvius or Accius, he is placed in the canon of the 
grammarian Volcacius Sedigitus third (immediately after Caecilius 
and Plautus) in the rank of Roman comic authors. He is there 
characterized as ardent and impetuous in character and style. He 
is also appealed to, with Plautus and Ennius, as a master of his 
art in one of the prologues of Terence. His comedy, like that of 
Plautus, seems to have been rather a free adaptation of his originals 
than a rude copy of them, as those of Livius probably were, or an 
artistic copy like those of Terence. The titles of most of them, like 
those of Plautus, and unlike those of Caecilius and Terence, are 
Latin, not Greek. He drew from the writers of the old political 
comedy of Athens, as well as from the new comedy of manners, and he 
attempted to make the stage at Rome, as it had been at Athens, an 
arena of political and personal warfare. A strong spirit of partisanship 
is recognized in more than one of the fragments; and this spirit 
is thoroughly popular and adverse to the_ senatorial ascendancy 
which became more and more confirmed with the progress of the 
second Punic war. _ Besides his attack on the Metelli and other 
members of the aristocracy, the great Scipio is the object of a 
censorious criticism on account of a youthful escapade attributed to 
him. Among the few lines still remaining from his lost comedies, we 
seem to recognize the idiomatic force and rapidity of movement 
characteristic of the style of Plautus. There is also found that 
love of alliteration which is a marked feature in^ all the older 
Latin poets down even to Lucretius. _ In one considerable comic 
fragment attributed to him — the description of a coquette — there 
is great truth and shrewdness cf observation. But we find no 
trace of the exuberant comic power and geniality of his great con- 
temporary. 

He was not only the oldest native dramatist, but the first author 
of an epic poem (Bellum Punicum) — which', by combining the 
representation of actual contemporary history with a mythical 
background, may be said to have created the Roman type of epic 
poetry. The poem was one continuous work, but was divided into 
seven books by a grammarian of a later age. The earlier part of it 
treated of the mythical adventures of Aeneas in Sicily, Carthage 
and Italy, and borrowed from the interview of Zeus and Thetis in the 
first book of the Iliad the idea of the interview of Jupiter and Venus; 
which Virgil has made one of the cardinal passages in the Aeneid. 
The later part treated of the events of the first Punic war in the style 
of a metrical chronicle. An important influence in Roman literature 
and belief, which had its origin in Sicily, first appeared in this 
poem — the recognition of the mythical connexion of Aeneas and 
his Trojans with the foundation of Rome. The few remaining 
fragments produce the impression of vivid and rapid narrative^ to 
which the flow of the native Saturnian verse, in contradistinction 
to the weighty and complex structure of the hexameter, was naturally 
adapted. 

* The impression we get of the man is that, whether or not he 
actually enjoyed the full rights of Roman citizenship, he was a 

1 " If it were permitted that immortals should weep for mortals, 
the divine Camenae would weep for Naevius the poet ; for since he 
hath passed into the treasure-house of death men have forgotten 
at Rome how to speak in the Latin tongue." 



vigorous representative of the bold combative spirit of the ancient 
Roman commons. He was one of those who made the Latin 
language into a great organ of literature. The phrases still 
quoted from him have nothing of an antiquated sound, while they 
have a genuinely idiomatic ring. As a dramatist he worked more 
in the spirit of Plautus than of Ennius, Pacuvius, Accius or 
Terence; but the great Umbrian humorist is separated from his 
older contemporary, not only by his breadth of comic power, but 
by his general attitude of moral and political indifference. The 
power of Naevius was the more genuine Italian gift — the power of 
satiric criticism — which was employed in making men ridiculous, 
not, like that of Plautus, in extracting amusement from the 
humours, follies and eccentricities of life. Although our means of 
forming a fair estimate of Naevius are scanty, all that we do 
know of him leads to the conclusion that he was far from being 
the least among the makers of Roman literature, and that 
with the loss of his writings there was lost a vein of national 
feeling and genius which rarely reappears.

NAEVUS, a term in surgery signifying that form of tumour 
which is almost entirely composed of enlarged blood-vessels. 
There are three principal varieties: (1) the capillary naevus, 
consisting of enlarged capillaries, frequently of a purplish colour, 
hence the term " port- wine stain "; (2) the venous naevus, in 
which the veins are enlarged, of a bluish colour; (3) the arterial 
naevus, in which there is distinct pulsation, it being composed 
of enlarged and tortuous arteries. The naevus can be lessened 
in size by pressure. It generally occurs in the skin or immediately 
under it; sometimes it lies in the mouth in connexion with the 
raucous membrane. It is often congenital, hence the term 
" mother's mark," or it may appear in early childhood. It often 
grows rapidly, sometimes slowly, and sometimes growth .is 
checked, and it may gradually diminish in size, losing its vascu- 
larity and becoming fibrous and non-vascular. This natural cure 
is followed by less deformity than a cure by artificial means. 
Various methods are used by surgeons when an operation is 
called for: (1) the tumour may be excised; (2) a ligature tightly 
tied may be applied to the base of the tumour; (3) inflammation 
may be set up in the growth by the injection of irritating agents, 
— in this way its vascularity may be checked and the formation 
of fibrous tissue encouraged; (4) the blood in the enlarged vessels 
may be coagulated by the injection of coagulating agents or by 
electrolysis. * 

NAGA HILLS, a district of British India in the Hills division 
of Eastern Bengal and Assam. It forms part of the mountainous 
borderland lying between the Brahmaputra valley and Upper 
Burma. Area, 3070 sq. m.; pop. (1901) 102,402. Towards the 
N. lie the Patkoi hills, over which British jurisdiction has never 
been extended; but since 1904 the southern tract, formerly 
known as the " area of political control," has been incorporated 
in the district, thus extending its E. boundary from the Dikho 
to the Tizic river. The whole country forms a wild expanse of 
forest, mountain and stream. The valleys are covered with 
dense jungle, dotted with small lakes and marshes. Coal is 
known to exist in many localities, as well as iron ore and petro- 
leum. The administrative headquarters of the district are at 
Kohima (pop. 3093), which is garrisoned by two companies of 
native infantry and a battalion of military police. The Dimapur- 
Manipur cart-road crosses the hills, connecting Kohima with 
the Assam-Bengal railway. 

Naga means " naked," and is the term applied by the Assamese 
to the wild tribes of the hills, of which the chief clans are called 
Angami, Ao, Shota, Sema and Rengma. These tribes have 
shown extraordinary obstinacy in their resistance to the British 
arms. Between 1832 and 1849 ten armed expeditions were 
despatched to chastise them, and from 1866 to 1887 there were 
eight more, a record which exceeds that of the most turbulent

tribes on the North- West Frontier. Since 1892, however, little 
trouble has been experienced.

NAGAR, formerly Bednur, a village and ruined city of Mysore, 
India; pop. (1901) 715. About 1640 the seat of government of 
the rajas of Keladi was transferred to this place. When taken 
by Hyder Ali in 1763, it is said to have yielded a plunder of 
twelve millions. In 1783 it surrendered to a British detachment 
under General Matthews, but being shortly after invested by 
Tippoo Sultan, the garrison capitulated on condition of safe 
conduct to the coast. Tippoo violated the stipulation, put 
General Matthews and the principal officers to death, and 
imprisoned the remainder of the force. 

NAgARJUNA, a celebrated Buddhist philosopher and writer. 
He is constantly quoted in the literature of the later schools 
of Buddhism, and a very large number of works in Sanskrit is 
attributed to him. None of these has been critically edited or 
translated; and there is much uncertainty as to the exact date 
of his career, and as to his opinions. The most probable date 
seems to be the early part of the 3rd century a.d. He seems to 
have been born in the south of India, and to have lived under the 
patronage of a king of southern Kosala, the modern Chattisgarh. 
Chinese and Tibetan authorities differ as to the name of this 
monarch; but it apparently is meant to represent an Indian 
name Satavahana, which is a dynastic title, not a personal name. 
Of the works he probably wrote one was a treatise advocating 
the Madhyamaka views of which he is the reputed founder; 
another a long and poetical prose work on the stages of the 
Bodhisattva career; and a third a voluminous commentary on 
the Mahdprajnd-pdrdmitd Sutra. Chinese tradition ascribes 
to him special knowledge of herbs, of astrology, of alchemy 
and of medicine. Two medical treatises, one on prescriptions in 
general, the other on the treatment of eye-disease, are said, by 
Chinese writers, to be by him. Several poems of a didactic 
character are also ascribed to him. The best known of these 
poems is The Friendly Epistle addressed to King Udayana. 
A translation into English of a Tibetan version of this piece has 
been published by Dr Wenzel.

NAGASAKI* a town on the south-west of the island of Kiushiu, 
Japan, in 32 44' N., 129 51' E., with 163,324 (1905) inhabitants, 
and a foreign settlement containing a population of 400 (ex- 
cluding Chinese). The first port of entry for ships coming from 
the south or the west to Japan, it lies at the head of a beautiful 
inlet some 3 m. long, which forms a splendid anchorage, and is 
largely used hy ships coming to coal and by warships. Marine 
products, coal and cotton goods are the chief exports, and raw 
cotton, iron, as well as other metals and materials used for ship- 
building, constitute the principal imports. The value of imports 
approaches £2,000,000 annually. That of exports has fluctuated 
considerably. In 1889 it was £1,005,367, but in 1894 it was only 
£444,839, and does not generally exceed £450,000. The most 
important industries of the town are represented by the engine 
works of Aka-no-ura, three large docks and a patent slip, the 
property of the Mitsu Bishi Company. Steamers of over 6000 
tons have been constructed at these docks, which, as well as the 
engine works, are situated on the western shore of the inlet. 
The brisk atmosphere of business that pervades them does not 
reach the town on the eastern side, which lies under the shadow of 
forests of tombstones that cover the over-looking hills. Nagasaki 
is noted as a coaling station. The coal is obtained chiefly from 
Takashima, an islet 8 m. S.E. of the entrance to the harbour, 
and in lesser quantities from two other islets, Naka-no-shima 
and Ha-shima, which lie about 1 m. farther out. These sources 
of supply, however, show signs of exhaustion. There are several 
favourite health resorts in the neighbourhood of Nagasaki, 
notably Unzen, with its sulphur springs. 

- Nagasaki owed its earliest importance to foreign intercourse. 
Originally called Fukae-no-ura (Fukae Bay), it was included in 



the fief of Nagasaki Kotaro in the 12th century, and from him 
it took its name. But it remained an insignificant village until 
the 1 6th century, when, becoming the headquarters of Japanese 
Christianity, and subsequently the sole emporium of foreign 
trade in the hands of the Dutch and the Chinese, it developed 
considerable prosperity. The opening of the port of Moji for 
export trade deprived Nagasaki of its monopoly as a coaling 
station, and the visits of war vessels were reduced when Russia 
acquired Port Arthur, Great Britain Wei-hai-wei and Germany 
Kiaochow. On the north side of the channel by which the 
harbour is entered there stands a cliff called Takaboko, which, 
under the name of Pappenberg, has long been rendered notorious 
by a tradition that thousands of Christians were precipitated 
from it in the 17th century because they refused to trample on 
the Cross. It has been conclusively proved that the legend 
is untrue. 

NAGAUft or Nagore, a town in India, in Jodhpur state of 
Rajputana, with a station on the Jodhpur-Bikanir railway. 
Pop. (1901) 13,377. Nagaur is surrounded by a wall more than 
4 m. in circuit. It has given its name to a famous breed of cattle. 

NAGELSBACH,* CARL FRIEDRICH (1806-1859), German 
classical scholar, was born at Wohrd near Nuremburg on the 28th 
of March 1806. After studying at Erlangen and Berlin, he 
accepted in 1827 an appointment at the Nuremberg gymnasium, 
and was professor of classics at Erlangen'from 1842 till his death 
on the 21st of April 1859. Nagelsbach is chiefly known for his 
excellent Lateinische Stilistik (1846; 9th ed. by Ivan Miiller, 
1905). Two other important works by him are Die Homerische 
Theologie (1840; 3rd ed. by G. Autenrieth, 1886) and Die 
Nachhomerische Theologie (1857).

NAGINA, a town of British India, in Bijnor district of the 
United Provinces, on the Oudh & Rohilkhand railway, 48 m. 
N.W. of Moradabad. Pop. (1901) 21,412. There is considerable 
trade in sugar, besides manufactures of guns, glassware (especially 
bottles for the use of pilgrims carrying the sacred water of the 
Ganges from Hardwar), ebony wares, hemp-sacking and cotton 
cloth. 

NAGODE, a native state of Central India, in the Baghelkhand 
agency. Area, 501 sq. m. Pop. (1901) 67,092, showing a de- 
crease of 20% in the decade, due to famine; estimated revenue, 
£11,000. The chief, whose title is raja, is a Rajput of the Parihar 
clan. The town of Nagode is 17 m. W. of the British station of 
Sutna. Pop. (1901) 3887. It was formerly a military canton- 
ment, and has an Anglo- vernacular school and dispensary. 
The former capital (until 1720) was Unchahra. 

NAGOYA, the capital of the province of Owari, Japan, on 
the great trunk railway of Japan, 235 m. from Tokyo and 94 m. 
from Kioto. Pop. (1903) 284,829. It is the fifth of the chief 
cities in Japan. It lies near the head of the shallow Isenumi 
Bay, about 30 m. from the port of Yokkaichi, with which it 
communicates by light-draught steamers and by rail. The 
castle o! Nagoya, erected in 1610, never suffered in war, but in 
modern times became a military dep6t; the interior contains 
much splendid decoration. The central keep of the citadel is 
a remarkable structure, covering close upon half an acre, but 
rapidly diminishing in each of its five storeys till the top room 
is only about 12 yds. square. Gabled roofs and hanging rafters 
break the almost pyramidal outline; and a pair of gold-plated 
dolphins 8 ft. high form a striking finial. Both were removed 
in 1872, and one of them was at the Vienna Exhibition in 1873; 
but they have been restored to their proper site. The religious 
buildings of Nagoya include a very fine Buddhist temple, Higashi 
Honjgwanji. Nagoya is well known as one of the great seats of the 
pottery trade; 13 J m. distant are the potteries of Seto, where 
the first glazed pottery made in Japan was produced by Kato 
Shirozaemon, after a visit to China in 1229. From Kato's time 
Seto continued, during several centuries, to be the chief centre 
of ceramic production in Japan, the manufacture of porcelain 
being added to that of pottery in the 19th century. All the

products of the flourishing industry now carried on there and at 
other places in the province are transported to Nagoya, for sale 
there or for export. Cotton mills have been established, and an 
extensive business is carried on in the embroidery of handker- 
chiefs. Another of its celebrated manufactures is arimatsu- 
skibori, or textile fabrics (silk or cotton), dyed so as to show spots 
in relief from which the colour radiates. It is further distin- 
guished as the birthplace of cloisonne enamelling in Japan, all 
" work of that nature before 1838 — when a new departure was made 
by Kaji Tsunekichi — having been for purposes of subordinate 
decoration. Quantities of cloisonne enamels are now produced 
in the town. 

NAGPUR, a city, district and division of British India, in the 
Central Provinces. The city is 1125 ft. above the sea; railway 
station, 520 m. E. of Bombay. Pop. (1901) 127,734. The town 
is well laid out, with several parks and artificial lakes, and has 
numerous Hindu temples. The prettily wooded suburb of Sita- 
baldi contains the chief government buildings, the houses of 
Europeans, the railway station and the cantonments, with fort 
and arsenal. In the centre stands Sitahaldi Hill, crowned with 
the fort. Beyond the station lies the broad sheet of water 
known as the Jama Talao,and farther east is the city, completely 
hidden in a mass of foliage. Handsome tanks and gardens, 
constructed by the Mahratta princes, lie outside the city. The 
palace, built of black basalt and profusely ornamented with 
wood carving, was burnt down in 1864, and only the great gate- 
way remains. The garrison consists of detachments of European 
and native infantry from Kampti. Nagpur is the headquarters 
of two corps of rifle volunteers. It is the junction of two im- 
portant railway systems — the Great Indian Peninsula to .Bombay 
and the Bengal-Nagpur to Calcutta. The large weaving popu- 
lation maintain their reputation for producing fine fabrics. 
There are steam cotton mills and machinery for ginning and 
pressing cotton. The gaol contains an important printing 
establishment. Education is provided by two aided colleges — 
the Hislop and the Morris, called after a missionary and a former 
chief commissioner; four high schools; a law school; an 
agricultural school, with a class for the scientific training of 
teachers; a normal school; a zenana mission for the manage- 
ment of girls' schools; an Anglican and two Catholic schools for 
Europeans. There are several libraries and reading rooms, 
and an active Anjuman or Mahommedan society. 

The District of Nagpur has an area of 384 sq. m. Pop. 
(1901) 751,844. It lies immediately below the great tableland 
of the Satpura range. A second line of hills shuts in the district 
on the south-west, and a third runs from north to south, parting 
the country into two plains of unequal size. These hills are all 
offshoots of the Satpuras, and nowhere attain any great ele- 
vation. Their heights are rocky and sterile, but the valleys and 
lowlands yield rich crops of corn and garden produce. The 
western plain slopes down to the river Wardha, is watered by the 
Jam and Madar, tributaries of the Wardha, and contains the 
most highly-tilled land in the district, abounding in fruit trees 
and the richest garden cultivation. The eastern plain (six times 
the larger), stretching away to the confines of Bhandara and 
Chanda, consists of a rich undulating country, luxuriant with 
mango groves and dotted towards the east with countless small 
tanks. It is watered by the Kanhan, with its tributaries, which 
flows into the Wainganga beyond the district. The principal 
crops are millets, wheat, oil-seeds and cotton. There are steam 
factories for ginning and pressing cotton at the military canton- 
ment of Kampti, which was formerly the chief centre of trades. 
An important new industry is manganese mining. The district 
is traversed hy the two lines of railway which meet at Nagpur 
city, and several branches are under construction. 

The Division of Nagpur comprises the five districts of Nagpur, 
Bhandara, Chanda, Wardha and Balaghat. Area, 23,521 sq. m. 
Pop. (1901) 3,728,063, showing a decrease of 9% in the decade. 

See Nagpur District Gazetteer (Bombay, 1908). 

NAGYKANIZSA, a town of Hungary, in the county of Zala, 
137 m. S.W. of Budapest by rail. Pop. (1900) 23,255. It 
possesses distilleries and brick-making factories, and has trade 



in cereals and cattle. Nagykanizsa once ranked as the second 
fortress of Hungary, and consequently played an important part 
during the wars with the Turks, who, having gained possession 
of it in 1600, held it until, in 1690, after a siege of two years, 
it was recovered by the Austrian and Hungarian forces. In 
1702 the fortifications were destroyed. 

NAGYKIKINDA, a town of Hungary, in the county of Torontal, 
152 m. S.E. of Budapest by rail. Pop. (1900) 24,843, of which 
about 60% are Servians. Being one of the centres of production 
of the famous wheat of the Banat, its flour industry is important. 
Fruit-farming and cattle-rearing are extensively carried on in the 
neighbourhood. 

NAGYSZEBEN (Ger. Hermannstadt, Rumanian Sibiu), a town 
of Hungary, in Transylvania, the capital of the county of 
Szeben, 122 m. S. S.E. of Kolozsvar by rail. Pop. (1900) 26,077, 
of whom 16,141 were Saxons (Germans), 7106 Rumanians, 
and 5747 Magyars. It is beautifully situated at an altitude 
of 141 1 ft. in the fertile valley of the Cibin (Hungarian, Szeben), 
encircled on all sides by the Transylvanian Alps. It is the seat 
of a Greek Orthodox (Rumanian) archbishop, and of the super- 
intendent of the Protestants for the Transylvanian circle. Some 
parts of Nagyszeben have a medieval appearance, with houses 
built in the old German style. The most noteworthy of its public 
buildings is the handsome Protestant Church, begun in the 14th 
century and finished in 1520, in the Gothic style, containing a 
beautiful cup-shaped font, cast by Meister Leonhardus in 1438, 
and a large mural painting of the Crucifixion by Johannes von 
Rosenau (144s). In the so-called New Church, comprising the 
west part of the whole building, which is an addition of the 
1 6th century, are many beautiful memorials of Saxon notables. 
Other buildings are: the Roman Catholic parish church, founded 
in 1726; the church of the Ursuline nuns, built in 1474; the 
town hall, an imposing building of the 1 5th century, purchased 
by the municipality in 1545 and containing the archives of the 
"Saxon nation." The Brukenthal palace, built in 1777-1787 
by Baron Samuel von Brukenthal (1721-1803), governor of 
Transylvania, contains an interesting picture-gallery with good 
examples of the Dutch school, and a library. The museum 
contains a natural history section with the complete fauna 
and flora of Transylvania, and a rich ethnographical section. 
Nagyszeben has a law academy, a seminary for Greek Orthodox 
priests, a military academy and several secondary schools. 
There are manufactures of cloth, linen, leather, caps, boots, 
soap, candles, ropes, as well as breweries and distilleries. 

The German name of the town is traceable to Hermann, a 
citizen of Nuremberg, who about the middle of the 12th century 
established a colony on the spot. In the 13th century it bore' 
the name of Villa Hermanni. Under the last monarchs of the 
native Magyar dynasty Hermannstadt enjoyed exceptional 
privileges, and its commerce with the East rose to importance. 
In the course of the 15th and 16th centuries it was several 
times besieged by the Turks. At the beginning of 1849 it was 
the scene of several engagements between the Austrians and 
Hungarians; and later in the year it was several times taken 
and retaken by the Russians and Hungarians. 

NAGYSZOMBAT (Ger. Tyrnau), a town of Hungary, in the 
county of Pozsony, 115 m. N.W. of Budapest by rail. Pop. 
(1900) 12,422. It is situated on the Trnava, and has played an 
important r6Ie in the ecclesiastical history of Hungary. It 
gained prominence after 1543, when the archbishop of Esztergom 
and primate of Hungary made it his residence after the capture 
of Esztergom by the Turks. In consequence numerous churches 
and convents were built, and the town acquired the title of " Little 
Rome." It possesses a Roman Catholic seminary for priests, 
and was the seat of a university founded in 1635, which was 
transferred to Budapest in 1777. In 1820 the archbishop's 
residence was again removed to Esztergom. It has an active 
trade in cereals and cattle. 

NAGY-VARAD (Ger. Grosswardein) , a town of Hungary, 
capital of the county of Bihar, 153 m. E.S.E. of Budapest by 
rail. Pop. (1900) 47,018. It is situated in a plain on both banks 
of the river Seheskoros, and is the seat of a Roman Catholic 



NAHE— NAIL

and of a Greek (Old-United) bishopric. Among its principal 
buildings are the St Ladislaus parish church, built in 1723, 
which contains the remains of the king St Ladislaus (d. 1095), 
the Roman Catholic cathedral, built in 1 752-1 779, the Greek 
cathedral, the large palace of the Roman Catholic bishop, built 
in 1778 in the rococo style, the archaeological and historical 
museum, with an interesting collection of ecclesiastical art, and 
the county and town hall. Among the educational establishments 
are a law academy, a seminary for priests, a modern school, 
a Roman Catholic and a Calvinistic gymnasium, a commercial 
academy, a training school for teachers and a secondary school 
for girls. Nagy-Varad is an important railway junction; it 
possesses extensive manufactures of pottery and large distilleries, 
and carries on a brisk trade in agricultural produce, cattle, horses, 
fruit and wine. About 6 m. S. of the town is the village of Hajo, 
which contains the Piispok Ftirdo or Bishop's Baths, with warm 
saline and sulphurous waters (92 to 103 F.), used both for

Nagy-Varad is one of the oldest towns in Hungary. Its 
bishopric was founded by St Ladislaus in 1080. The town 
was destroyed by the Tatars in 1241. Peace was concluded 
here on the 24th of February 1538 between Ferdinand I. of 
Austria and his rival John Zapolya, voivode of Transylvania. 
In 1556 it passed into the possession of Transylvania, but 
afterwards reverted to Austria. In 1598 the fortress was un- 
successfully besieged by the Turks, but it fell into their hands 
in 1660 and was recovered by the Austrians in 1692. The 
Greek Old-United or Catholic bishopric was founded in 1776. 

NAHE, a river of Germany, a left-bank tributary of, the Rhine, 
rises near Selbach in the Oldenburg principality of Birkenfeld. 
For some distance it forms the boundary between the Bavarian 
Palatinate and the Prussian Rhine Province, and it falls into the 
Rhine at Bingen. Its length is 78 m., but it is too shallow and 
rocky to be navigable. Its picturesque valley, through which 
runs the railway from Bingerbriick to Neunkirchen, is largely 
visited by tourists.

NAHUATLAN STOCK, a North and Central American Indian 
stock. Nahuas or Nahuatlecas was the collective name for the 
dominant Indian peoples of Mexico at the time of the Spanish 
conquest, and the Nahuatlan stock consisted of the Nahuas (or 
Aztecs) and a few scattered tribes in Central America. 

NAHUM (Hebrew for " rich in comfort [is God] "), an Old 
Testament prophet. The name occurs only in the book of Nahum ; 
in Nehemiah vii. 7 it is a scribal error for " Renum," Of the 
prophet himself all that is known is the statement of the title 
that he was an Elkoshite. But the locality denoted by the 
designation is quite uncertain. Later tradition associated 
Nahum with the region of Nineveh, against which he prophesied, 
and hence his tomb has been located at a place bearing the name 
of Alkush near Mosul (anc. Nineveh) and is still shown. 1 Accord- 
ing to Jerome, the prophet was a native of a village in Galilee, 
which bore the name of Elkesi in the 4th century a.d. (the Galilean 
town of Capernaum, which probably means " village of Nahum," 
may also point in the same direction; but cf. John vii. 29, 
which seems to imply that in the time of Christ no prophet 
was supposed to have come out of GaJilee). E. Nestle has 
proposed to locate Elkesi " beyond Betogabra " {i.e. Eleuthero- 
polis, mod. Beit Jibrin) in the tribe of Simeon (cf. Pal. ExpL 
Fund Quart. Statement, 1879, pp. 136-138). 

Book of Nahum. — The original heading of Nahum's prophecy 
is contained in the second part of the superscription: "[The 
book of] the vision of Nahum the Elkoshite " (cf. the similar 
headings in Isaiah, Obadiah and Habakkuk). The first part 
(" Oracle concerning Nineveh ") is a late editorial insertion, but 
correctly describes the main contents of the little book. 

Contents of the Book. (1) Chapters i. and ii. — The prophecy 
against Nineveh in its present form really begins with chap. ii. 1, 
followed immediately by v. 3, and readily falls into three parts, 
viz. (a) ii. 1, 3-10; (b) ii. M-13; and (c) iii. Here (a) describes in 
language of considerable descriptive power the assault on Nineveh — 

1 Jonah's grave has been located similarly in Nineveh itself. 



the city is mentioned by name in ii, 8 (9 Heb. text) — its capture 
and sack; (b) contains an oracle of Yahweh directed against the 
king of Assyria (" Behold, I am against thee, saith the Lord of 
Hosts," v. 13); (c) again gives a vivid picture of war and desolation 
which are to overtake and humiliate Nineveh, as they have already 
overtaken No-Amon (i.e. Egyptian Thebes, w. 8-10); the defence 
is pictured as futile and the rum complete. The absence of dis- 
tinctly religious motive from these chapters is remarkable; the 
divine name occurs only in the repeated refrain, " Behold, I am 
against thee, saith the Lord of Hosts," ii. 13, iii. 5. They express 
little more than merely human indignation at the oppression of 
the world-power, and picture with undisguised satisfaction the 
storm of war which overwhelms the imperial city. 

(2) Chapter i. forms the exordium to the prophecy of doom 
against Nineveh in the book as it lies before us. Its tone is exalted, 
and a fine picture is given of Yahweh appearing in judgment: 
"The Lord (Yahweh) is a jealous God and avengeth; the Lord 
avengeth and is full of wrath." The effects of the divine anger on 
the physical universe are forcibly described tyv. 3-6); on the 
other hand, God cares for those ' that put their trust in Him " 
(v. 7), but overwhelms His enemies (w. 8-i2a); in the following 
verses (126-15) the joyful news is conveyed to Judah of»the fall of 
the oppressor: — " Behold upon the mountains the feet of him that 
bringeth good tidings, that publisheth peace 1 Keep thy feasts, O 
Judah, perform thy vows; for the wicked one shall no more pass 
through thee; he is utterly cut off" (v. 15). 

Regarding chap. i. and ii. 2( = i. and ii. I, 3, Heb. text) there has 
been much discussion in recent years. It was long ago noticed that 
traces of an alphabetic acrostic survive in this section of the book; 
throughout the whole of chap. i. there is no reference to Nineveh, 
though in some of the verses (8-i2a, 14) .the enemies of Yahweh are 
addressed, who have usually been identified with the people or city 
of Nineveh; in w. 126, 13 and (certainly) v. 15 ( = ii. 1 Heb.) 
Judah appears to be addressed. The text of i. 1-15, ii. 1-2 has been 
reconstructed by H. Gunkel and G. Bickell so as to form a complete 
alphabetic psalm with contents of an eschatological character, and 
is regarded by them as a later addition to the book. It may be a 
14 generalizing supplement " prefixed by the editor, possibly because 
the original introduction to the oracle had been mutilated. It is 
generally held by critical scholars that i. 1-8, 13, 15, and ii. 2 cer- 
tainly do not proceed from Nahum; i. 9-12 may, however, belong 
to the prophet. The phenomena are conflicting and a completely 
satisfactory solution seems to be impossible. 

Date of Nahum's Oracle. — The date of the composition of 
Nahum's prophecy must lie between 607-606, when Nineveh was 
captured and destroyed by the Babylonians and Medes, and the 
capture of Thebes (No-Amon) which is alluded to in iii. 8-10. 
This was effected for the second time and most completely by 
Assur-bani-pal in 663 or 662 B.C. The tone of the prophecy 
suggests, on the one hand, that the fall of Nineveh is imminent, 
while, on the other, the reference to Thebes suggests that the 
disaster that had befallen it was still freshly remembered. On 
the whole a date somewhat near 606 is more probable. It is 
noteworthy that no reference is made to the restoration of the 
northern kingdom of Israel, or the return of its exiles. The poetry 
of the book is of a high order.

NAIK, or Nayak, from a Sanskrit word meaning a leader, a 
title used in India in various senses. In the army it denotes a 
rank corresponding to that of corporal ; and Hyder Ah" of Mysore 
was proud of being called Haidar Naik, analogous to " le petit 
caporal " for Napoleon. It was also the title of the petty 
dynasties that arose in S. India on the downfall of the Hindu 
empire of Vijayanagar in the 16th century. 

NAIL (O. Eng. naegal, cf. Dutch, Ger.,Swed.«a^/; the word is 
also related to Lat. unguis, Gr. 6Vu£ , Sans, nakhas) a word applied 
both to the horny covering to the upper surface of the extremities 
of the fingers and toes of man and the Quadrumana (see Skin 
and Dermal Skeleton), and also to a headed pin or spike of 
metal, commonly of iron. The principal use of nails is in wood- 
work (joinery and carpentery), but they are also employed in 
numerous other trades. Size, form of head, nature of point, and 
special uses all give names to different classes of nails. Thus we 
have tacks, sprigs and brads for very small nails; rose, clasp 
and clout, according to the form of head; and flat points or 
sharp points according to the taper of the spike. According to

the method of manufacture nails fall into four principal classes: 
(i) hand-wrought nails; (2) machine-wrought and cut nails; 
(3) wire or French nails; and (4) cast nails. 

The nailer handicraft was formerly a great industry in the 
country around Birmingham. The nails are forged from nail- 
rods heated in a small smith's hearth, hammered on an anvil, the 
nail length cut off on a chisel and the head formed by dropping 
the spike into a hole in a " bolster " of steel, from which enough 
of the spike is left projecting to form the head. In the case of 
clasp nails the head is formed with two strokes of the hammer, 
while rose nails require four. The heads of the larger-sized nails 
are made with an " oliver " or mechanical hammer, and for 
ornamental or stamped heads " swages " or dies are employed. 
The conditions of life and labour among the hand nailers in 
England were exceedingly unsatisfactory: married women and 
young children of both sexes working long hours in small filthy 
sheds attached to their dwellings; their employment was con- 
trolled by middle-men or nail-masters, who supplied them with 
the nail-rods and paid for work done, sometimes in money and 
sometimes in kind on the truck system. Machine-wrought and cut 
nails have supplanted most corresponding kinds of hand-made 
nails. Horse nails are still made by hand-labour. These are 
made from the finest Swedish charcoal iron, hammered out to a 
sharp point. They must be tough and homogeneous throughout, 
so that there may be no danger of their breaking over and leaving 
portions in the hoof. 

In 161 7 Sir D. Bulmer devised a machine for cutting nail-rods, 
and in 1 790 T. Clifford patented a device for shaping the rods, but 
the credit of perfecting machinery mainly belongs to American 
enterprise (the first American patent appears to be that of 
Ezekiel Reed, dated 1786). The machine, fed with heated (to 
black heat only) strips of metal, usually mild steel, having a 
breadth and thickness sufficient for the nail to be made, shears 
off by its sheer the " nail blank," which, falling down, is firmly 
clutched at the neck till a heading die strikes against its upper 
end and forms the head, the completed nail passing out through 
an inclined shoot. In large nails the taper of the shank and 
point is secured by the sectional form to which the strips are 
rolled; brads, sprigs and small nails, on the other hand, are cut 
from uniform strips in an angular direction from head to point, 
the strip being turned over after each blank is cut so that the 
points and heads are taken from opposite sides alternately, and 
a uniform taper on two opposite sides of the nail, from head to 
point, is secured. The machines turn out nails with wonderful 
rapidity, varying with the size of the nails produced from about 
100 to 1000 per minute. Wire or French nails are made from 
round wire, which is unwound, straightened, cut into lengths and 
headed by a machine either by intermittent blows or by pressure, 
but the pointing is accomplished by the pressure of dies. Cast 
nails, which are cast in sand moulds by the ordinary process, are 
used principally for horticultural purposes, and the hob-nails or 
tackets of shoemakers are also cast.

Machinery (1848); Bucknall Smith, wire, Its Manufacture and

NAIL VIOLIN (Ger. Nagelgeigej Nagdharmonica), a musical 
curiosity invented by Johann Wilde, a musician in the imperial 
orchestra at St Petersburg. The nail violin or harmonica consists 
of a wooden soundboard about i£ ft. long and 1 ft. wide bent into 
a semicircle. In this soundboard are fixed a number of iron or 
brass nails of different lengths, tuned to give a chromatic scale. 
Sound is produced by friction with a strong bow, strung with 
black horsehair. An improved instrument, now in the collection 
of the Hochschule in Berlin, has two half-moon sound-chests of 
different sizes, one on the top of the other, forming terraces. In 
the rounded wall of the upper sound-chest are two rows of iron 
staples, the upper giving the diatonic scale, and the lower the 
intermediate chromatic semitones. History records the name of 
a single virtuoso on this instrument, which has a sweet bell-like 
tone but limited technical possibilities; he was a Bohemian 
musician called Senal, who travelled all over Germany with his 
instrument about 1 780-1 790. (K. S.) 



NAINI TAL, a town and district of British India, in the 
Kumaon division of the United Provinces. The town is 6400 ft. 
above sea-level. Pop. (1901) 7609. Naini Tal is a popular 
sanatorium for the residents in the plains, and the summer head- 
quarters of the government of the province. It is situated on a 
lake, surrounded by high mountains, and is subject to landslides; 
a serious catastrophe of this kind occurred in September 1880. 
The approach from the plains is by the Rohilkhand and Kumaon 
railway from Bareilly, which has its terminus at Kathgodam, 
22 m. distant by cart road. There are several European schools, 
besides barracks and convalescent dep6t for European soldiers. 

The District of Naini Tal comprises the lower hills of 
Kumaon and the adjoining Tarai or submontane strip. Area, 
2677 sq. m. Pop. (1901) 311*237, showing a decrease of 15-4% 
in the decade. The district includes the Gagar and other 
foothills of the Himalayas, which reach an extreme height of 
nearly 9000 ft. The Bhabar tract at their base consists of boulders 
from the mountains, among which the hill streams are swallowed 
up. Forests cover vast tracts of the hill-country and the Bhabar. 
Beyond this is the Tarai, moist and extremely unhealthy. Here 
the principal crops are rice and wheat. In the hills a small 
amount of tea is grown, and a considerable quantity of fruit. 
The only railway is the line to Kathgodam. 

See Naini Tal District Gazetteer (Allahabad, 1904). 

NAIRN, a royal, municipal and police burgh and county town 
of Nairnshire, Scotland. Pop. of the royal burgh (1901) 5089. 
It is situated on the Moray Firth, at the mouth of the Nairn and 
on its left bank, 15J m. N.E. of Inverness by the Highland 
railway. The town, though of immemorial age, shows no signs 
of its antiquity, being bright, neat and modern. It attracts 
many summer visitors by its good sea bathing and excellent 
golf-course. The industries include salmon fishing, deep-sea 
fishing, the making of rope and twine and the freestone quarries 
of the neighbourhood. There is a commodious harbour with 
breakwater and pier. Nairn belongs to the Inverness district 
group of parliamentary burghs (Forres, Fortrose, Inverness and 
Nairn). Nairn was originally called Invernarne (the mouth of 
theNairn). It was made a royal burgh by Alexander I. (d. 1124), 
but this charter having been lost it was confirmed by James VI. 
in 1589. 

NAIRNE, CAROLINA, Baroness (1766-1845), Scottish song 
writer, was born in the " auld hoose " of Gask, Perthshire, on 
the 16th of August 1766. She was descended from an old family 
which had settled in Perthshire in the 13th century, and could 
boast of kinship with the royal race of Scotland.' Her father, 
Laurence Oliphant, was one of the foremost supporters of the 
Jacobite cause, and she was named Carolina in memory of Prince 
Charles Edward. In the schoolroom she was known as " pretty 
Miss Car," and afterwards her striking beauty and pleasing 
manners earned for her the name of the " Flower of Stratheam." 
In 1806 she married W. M. Nairne, who became Baron Nairne 
(see below) in 1824. Following the example set by Burns in the 
Scots Musical Museum, she undertook to bring out a collection 
of national airs set to appropriate words. To the collection she 
contributed a large number of original songs, adopting the 
signature " B. B." — " Mrs Bogan of Bogan." The music was 
edited by R. A. Smith, and the collection was published at 
Edinburgh under the name of the Scottish Minstrel (1821- 
1824). After her husband's death in 1830 Lady Nairne took 
up her residence at Enniskerry, Co. Wicklow, but she spent 
much time abroad. She died at Gask on the 26th of October 
1845. 

Her songs may be classed under three heads: (1) those 
illustrative of the characters and manners of the old Scottish 
gentry, such as " The Laird o* Cockpen," " The Fife Laird," 
and "John Tod"; (2) Jacobite songs, composed for the most 
part to gratify her kinsman Robertson, the aged chief of Strowan, 
among the best known of which are perhaps " Wha '11 be King 
but Charlie? " " Charlie is my darling," " The Hundred Pipers," 
" He's owre the Hills," and " Bonnie Charlie's noo awa "; 
and (3) songs not included under the above heads, ranging over 
a variety of subjects from " Caller Herrin' " to the " Land o' the 



NAIRNSHIRE— NAIROBI 



J 55 



Leal." For vivacity, genuine pathos and bright wit her songs 
are surpassed only by those of Burns. 

Lady Nairne's husband, William Murray Nairne (1757-1830). 
He was descended from Sir Robert Nairne of Strathord (c. 1620- 
1683), a supporter of Charles II., who was created Baron Nairne 
in 1 68 1. After his death without issue the barony passed to 
his son-in-law, Lord William Murray (c. 1665-1726), the husband 
of his only daughter Margaret (1660-1747) and a younger son 
of John Murray, 1st marquess of Athole. William, who took 
the name of Nairne and became 2nd Baron Nairne, joined the 
standard of the Jacobites in 171 5; he was taken prisoner at the 
battle of Preston and was sentenced to death. He was, however, 
pardoned, but his title was forfeited. His son John (c. 1691- 
1770), who but for this forfeiture would have been the 3rd 
Baron Nairne, was also taken prisoner at Preston, but he was 
soon set at liberty. In the rising of 1745 he was one of the 
Jacobite leaders, being present at the battles of Prestonpans, of 
Falkirk and of Culloden, and consequently he was attainted in 
1746; but escaped to France. His son John (d. 1782) was the 
father of William Murray Nairne, who, being restored to the 
barony of Nairne in 1824, became the 5th baron. The male line 
became extinct when his son William, the 6th baron (1808-1837), 
died unmarried. The next heir was a cousin, Margaret, Baroness 
Keith of Stonehaven Marischal (178S-1867), wife of Auguste 
Charles Joseph, comte de Flahaut de la Billarderie, but she did 
not claim the title. In 1874, however, the right of her daughter, 
the wife of the 4th marquess of Lansdowne, was allowed by the 
House of Lords.

NAIRNSHIRE, a north-eastern county of Scotland, bounded 
W. and S. by Inverness-shire, E. by Elginshire and N. by the 
Moray Firth. It has an area of 103,429 acres or 161 -6 sq. m., 
and a coast line of 9 m. and is the fourth smallest county in 
Scotland. The seaboard, which is skirted by sandbanks danger- 
ous to navigation, is lined by low dunes extending into Elginshire. 
Parallel with the coast there is a deposit of sand and gravel 
about 90 ft. high stretching inland for 4 or 5 m. This and the 
undulating plain behind are a continuation westward of the fertile 
Laigh of Moray. From this region southward the land rises 
rapidly to the confines of Inverness-shire, where the chief heights 
occur. Several of these border hills exceed 2000 ft. in altitude, 
the highest being Cam Glas (2162 ft.). The only rivers of 
importance are the Findhorn and the Nairn, both rising in 
Inverness-shire. The Findhorn after it leaves that county 
takes a mainly north-easterly direction down Strathdearn for 
17 m. and enters the sea to the north of Forres in Elginshire 
after a total course of 70 m. The Nairn, shortly after issuing 
from Strathnairn, flows towards the N.E. for 12 m. out of its 
complete course of 38 m. and falls into the Moray Firth at the 
county town. There are eight lochs, all small, but. the loch of 
Clans is of particular interest because of its examples of crannogs, 
or lake-dwellings. Nairnshire contains many beautiful woods and 
much picturesque and romantic scenery. 

Geology. — The county is divided geologically into two clearly- 
marked portions. The southern and larger portion is composed 
of the eastern, Dalradian or younger Highland schists with associated 
granite masses; this forms all the higher ground. The low-lying 
northern part of the country bordering Moray Firth is occupied by 
Old Red Sandstone. The schistose rocks are mainly thin bedded 
micaceous gneisses, schists and tjuartzites; between Dallaschyle 
and Creag an Daimb a more massive higher horizon appears in the 
centre of a synclinal fold. Porphyritic gneiss is found on the flanks 
of Cam nan tri-tighearnan. The schists are frequently intersected 
by dikes of granite, amphibolite, &c. Three masses of granite are 
found penetrating the schists; the largest lies on the eastern 
boundary and extends from about Lethen Bar Hill southward by 
Ardclach and Glenferness to the Bridge of Dulsic. The second 
mass on the opposite side of the county belongs mainly to Inverness 
but the granite reaches into Nairn on the slopes of Bein nan Creagan 
and Ben Buidhe Mhor. A smaller mass near Rait Castle, with large 



pink crystals of orthoclase, has been employed as a building stone. 
On the denuded surface of the schists the Old Red Sandstone was 
deposited and formerly doubtless covered most of the county; 
outlying patches still remain near Drynachan Lodge and near 
Highland Boath in Muckle Burn. The Lower Old Red rocks are 
basal breccias followed by shales with calcareous nodules containing 
fossil fish. The Upper Old Red, which is found usually nearer the 
coast, is unconformable on the Lower series; it consists of red 
shales and clays and obliquely bedded sandstones. Glacial deposits 
are widely spread; they comprise a Lower Boulder Clay, a series 
of gravels and sands, followed by an Upper Boulder Clay, above 
which comes a series of gravel deposits forming ridges on the moor- 
land between the Nairn and Findhorn rivers. A fine kame, resting 
on the plain of sand and gravel, lies between Meikle Kildrummie 
and Loch Flemington, south of the railway. Traces of the old 
marine terraces at 100 ft., 50 ft. and 25 ft. are found near the coast, 
as well as considerable accumulations of blown sand. 

Climate and Industries. — The climate is healthy and equable. 
The temperature for the year averages 47 ° F., for January 38 ° F., 
and for July, 58 F. The mean annual rainfall is 25 in. The soil 
of the alluvial plain, or Laigh, is light and porous and careful cultiva- 
tion has rendered it very fertile; and there is some rich land on the 
Findhorn. Although the most advanced methods of agriculture are 
in use, but a small proportion of the surface is capable of tillage, only 
one-fifth of the whole area being under crops. The hills are mostly 
covered with heath and pasture, suitable for sheep, and cattle are 
kept on the lower lvin^ ground. The county accords many facilities 
for sport. A few distilleries, some sandstone and granite quarries 
and the sea and salmon^ fisheries of the Nairn practically represent 
the industries of the shire, apart from agriculture. The Highland 
Railway from Forres to Inverness crosses the north of the shire. 

Population and Government. — In 1891 the population numbered 
9155 and in 1901 it was 9291, or 57 persons to the sq. m. Besides 
the county town of Nairn (pop. 5089), there are the parishes of 
Ardclach (pop. 772), and Auldearn (pop. of parish 1292, of village 
313). Nairn and Elgin shires combine to return one member to 
parliament, and the county town belongs to the Inverness district 
group of parliamentary burghs (Forres, Fortrose, Inverness and 
Nairn). The shire forms a sheriffdom with Inverness and Elgin 
and a sheriff-substitute sits alternately at Nairn and Elgin. 

History. — The country was originally peopled by the Gaelic 
or northern Picts. Stone circles believed to have been raised 
by them are found at Moyness, Auldearn, Urchany, Ballinrait, 
Dalcross and Croy, the valley of the Nairn being especially rich 
in such relics. To the north of Dulsie Bridge is a monolith 
called the Princess Stone. A greater number of the mysterious 
prehistoric stones with cup-markings occur in Nairn than any- 
where else in Scotland. Mote hills are also common. Whether 
there was any effective Roman occupation of the land so far 
north is an open question, but there is little evidence of it in 
Nairn, beyond the occasional finding of Roman coins. Columba 
and his successors made valiant efforts to Christianize the Picts, 
but it was long before their labours began to tell, although the 
saint's name was preserved late in the 19th century in the annual 
fair at Auldearn called " St Colm's Market," while to his 
biographer Adamnan — corrupted into Evan or Wean — was 
dedicated the church at Cawdor, where an old Celtic bell also 
bears this name. By the dawn of the 10th century the Picts had 
been subdued with the help of the Norsemen, and Nairn, which 
was one of the districts colonized by the Scandinavians, as 
part of the ancient province of Moray, soon afterwards became 
an integral portion of the kingdom of Scotland. Macbeth was 
one of the kings that Moray gave to Scotland, and his name and 
memory survive to the present day. Hardmuir, between Brodie 
and Nairn, is the reputed heath where Macbeth met the witches. 
Territorially Moray was greatly contracted in the reign of David I., 
and thenceforward the history of Nairn merges in the main in 
that of the bishopric and earldom of Moray (see Elgin). The 
thane of Cawdor was constable of the king's castle at Nairn, 
and when the heritable sheriffdom was established towards the 
close of the 14th century this office was also filled by the thane 
of the time. *

Mahommedan and Hindu) and schools, an Indian bazaar, a 
general hospital and waterworks — the water being obtained 
from springs 13 m. distant. 

The site of Nairobi was selected as the headquarters of the 
Uganda railway, and the first buildings were erected in 1899. 
For some time nearly all its inhabitants were railway officials 
and Indian coolies engaged in the construction of the line. In 
1902 the surrounding highlands were found to be suitable for 
European settlement, and Nairobi speedily grew in importance; 
in 1907 the headquarters of the administration were transferred 
to it from Mombasa. The town is provided with clubs, cricket 
and athletic grounds and a racecourse. 

NAIVASHA, the name of a lake, town and province, in British 
East Africa. The lake, which is roughly circular with a diameter 
of some 13 m., lies at an altitude of 6135 ft. on the crest of the 
highest ridge in the eastern rift-valley between the Kikuyu 
escarpment on the east and the Mau escarpment on the west. 
It is fed from the north by the rivers Gilgal and Morendat, but 
has no known outlet. The rivers, which have a minimum dis- 
charge of 100 cub. ft. per second, run in deep gullies. The water 
of the lake is fresh; the shore in many places is lined with 
papyrus. North and north-west the lake is closed in by the 
volcanic Bum hills; to the south towers the extinct volcano of 
Longonot. Hippopotami and otters frequent the lake, and on an 
island about 1 m. from the shore are large numbers of antelopes 
and other game. Naivasha was discovered in 1883 by Gustav 
Adolf Fischer (1 848-1886), one of the early explorers of the Tana 
and Masai regions, and the first to demonstrate the continuance 
of the rift-valley through equatorial Africa. Fischer was 
followed later in the same year by Joseph Thomson, the Scottish 
explorer. The railway from Mombasa to Victoria Nyanza 
skirts the eastern side of the lake, and on the railway close to 
the lake is built the town of Naivasha, 6230 ft. above the sea, 
391 m. N.W. by rail of Mombasa and 193 m. S.E. by rail of Port 
Florence on Victoria Nyanza. Naivasha province contains 
much land suitable for colonization by white men, and large areas 
were leased to Europeans by the British authorities in 1903 and 
subsequent years. The East Africa Syndicate acquired a lease 
of 500 sq. m. in the valley of the Gilgal and surrounding country 
north of Lake Naivasha. North-west of the lake and along the 
Molo river the 3rd Lord Delamere obtained a grant of 155 
sq. m. 

NAJARA, ISRAEL BEN MOSES, Hebrew poet, was born in 
Damascus and wrote in the latter part of the 16th century (1587- 
1599). He was inspired by the mystical school, and his poems 
are marked by their bold, sensuous images, as well as by a depth 
of feeling unequalled among the Jewish writers of his age. 
He often adapted his verses to Arabic and Turkish melodies. 
To tunes which had been associated with light and even ribald 
themes, Najara wedded words which reveal an intensity of 
religious emotion which often takes a form indistinguishable 
from love poetry. Some pietist contemporaries condemned his 
work for this reason; but this did not prevent many of his 
poems from attaining wide popularity and from winning their 
way into the prayer-book. In fact, Najara could claim the 
authority of the Biblical " Song of Songs " (mystically inter- 
preted) for his combination of the language of human love with 
the expression of the relationship between God and humanity. 

He published during his lifetime a collection of his poems, Songs 
of Israel (Zemiroth Israel), in Safed in 1587; an enlarged edition 
appeared in Venice ( 1 599 -1 6o °) • Others of his poems were published 
at various times, and W. Bacher has described some previously 
unknown poems of Najara (Revue des itudes juives, Nos. 116 sen.).

NAJIBABAD, a town of British India, in the Bijnor district 
of the United Provinces, 31 m. S.E. of Hard war. Pop. (1901) 
19,568. It was founded in the middle of the 18th century by a 
Rohilla chief, and still contains several architectural monuments 
of Rohilla magnificence. It has a station on the Oudh & Rohil- 
khand railway, with a junction for the branch to Kotdwara. 
There is considerable trade in timber, sugar and grain, and 
manufactures of metal-ware, shoes, blankets and cotton cloth. 

NAKHICHEVAN, or Nakhjevan, a city of Russian Armenia, 
in the government of Erivan, 85 m. S.E. of the town of Erivan. 
It occupies the brow of a spur of the Kara-bagh mountains, 
2940 ft. above the sea, and looks out over the valley of the Aras. 
Pop. (1863) 6251, (1897) 8845. Built and rebuilt again and 
again, Nakhichevan is full of half-obliterated evidences of former 
prosperity. The present houses have for the most part been 
quarried from ancient ruins; of the palace of the princes of 
Azerbaijan there remains a gateway with a Persian inscription, 
flanked by two brick towers; and at a little distance stands the 
so-called Tower of the Khans,, a richly decorated twelve-sided 
structure, 102 ft. in circumference and 75 ft. in height, dating, 
to judge by the inscription which runs around the cornice, 
from the 12th century. There are also ruins of a large mosque. 
Situated on the highroad to Tabriz and Teheran, Nakhichevan 
has a large transit trade. In the Persian period the city is said 
to have had 40,000 inhabitants; the population now consists 
chiefly of Tatars and Armenians, who carry on gardening, make 
wine and produce silk, salt and millstones. 

Armenian tradition claims Noah as the founder of Nakhichevan 
(the Naxuana of Ptolemy), and a mound of earth in the city is still 
visited by many pilgrims as his grave. Laid waste by the Persians 
in the 4th century, Nakhichevan sank into comparative insignificance, 
but by the idlh century had recovered its prosperity. In 1064 it 
was taken by Alp Arslan, sultan of the Seljuk Turks, and in the 
13th century it fell a prey to the Mongols of Jenghiz Khan. It 
afterwards suffered frequently during the wars between the Persians, 
Armenians and Turks, and it finally passed into Russian possession 
by the peace of Turkman-chai in 1828, 

NAKHICHEVAN-ON-THE-DON, a town of southern Russia, 
in the Don Cossacks territory, 6 m. by rail N.E. of the town of 
Rostov and on the right bank of the Don. Pop. (1900) 30,883. 
It was founded in 1780 by Armenian immigrants. It soon 
became a wealthy place, and still is the administrative centre of 
the " Armenian district," a narrow strip along the banks of the 
Don, with a population of 27,250. The town has tobacco and • 
wadding factories, tallow-melting works, soap-works, brickworks 
and tanneries. There is a large trade in cereals and timber. 

NAKHON SRI TAM MARAT (also known as Lakhon and 
formerly as Ligore), a town of southern Siam, in the division 
of the same name, about 380 m. S. of Bangkok, on the east 
coast of the Malay Peninsula. It is one of the most ancient cities 
of Siam, and contains many buildings and ruins of antiquarian 
interest. The trade consists chiefly of the export of rice. In the 
bay, a short distance off, ships can lie safely at all seasons. 
The population (7000) is chiefly Siamese, but there is an ad- 
mixture of Burmese, the descendants of prisoners of war and of ' 
refugees from Tenasserim. The town is the headquarters of a 
governor under the high commissioner at Singora. It has for 
long been a centre of the American Presbyterian Mission to Siam. 
It was once the capital of a feudatory state, the chief of which 
ruled the greater part of the Malay Peninsula in the name of the 
kings of Siam and bore the brunt of all the wars with Malacca 
and other Malay states. It lies, however, north of the limit of 
Malay expansion, and has never at any time come under Malay 
rule. With the fall of the Siamese capital of Ayuthia in 1767 
it became independent, but returned to its allegiance on the 
founding of Bangkok. In the 17th century British, Portuguese 
and Dutch merchants had factories here and carried on an 
extensive trade. 

NAKSKOV, a seaport of Denmark, in the ami (county) of 
Maribo, on a wide bay of the Laalands belt at the west end of 
the island of Laaland, 31 m. by rail W. of Nykjobing. Pop. 
(1901) 8310. The church dates from the beginning of the 
15th century. There is a large sugar factory. A great dike,

extending S.E. to Rodby (20 m.), protects the coast against 
inundation, a serious inroad of the sea having occurred in 1872. 

NAMAQUALAND, a region of south-western Africa, extending 
along the west coast over 600 m. from Damaraland (22 43' 
S.) on the north to 31 S., and stretching inland 80 to 350 m. 
It is divided by the lower course of the Orange river into two 
portions — Little Namaqualand to the south and Great Namaqua- 
land to the north. Little Namaqualand forms part of Cape 
Colony (q.v.) } and Great Namaqualand is the southern portion 
of German South- West Africa (q.v.). The people of Namaqua- 
land are the purest surviving type of Hottentots, and number 
some twenty to thirty thousand. 

NAMASUDRA, the name adopted by the great caste or tribe 
who inhabit the swamps of Eastern Bengal, India, whom the 
higher castes are wont to designate by the opprobrious term of 
Chandal. Their number in 1901 exceeded 2 millions; but if 
the cognate Pods and also the Mahommedans of the same 
ethnical stock were to be added, the total would probably 
reach 11 millions. 

NAME (O. Eng. nama\ cognate forms in Teutonic languages 
are Dutch naam i Ger. Name, &c., but the word is common to all 
Indo-European languages; cf. Gr. 6vofxa f Lat. nomen, Sans. 
naman, &c.), the distinguishing appellation by which a person, 
place, thing or class of persons or things is known. 

Local Names. — The study of names and of their survival in 
civilization enables us in some cases to ascertain what peoples 
inhabited districts now tenanted by races of far different speech. 
Thus the names of mountains and rivers in many parts of England 
are Celtic — for example, to take familiar instances, Usk, Esk 
and Avon. There are also local names (such as Mona, Monmouth, 
Mynwy and others) which seem to be relics of tribes even older 
than the Celtic stocks, and " vestiges of non-Aryan people, 
whom the Celts found in possession both on the Continent and 
in the British Isles." 1 The later English name is sometimes 
the mere translation, perhaps unconscious, of the earlier Celtjc 
appellation, often added to the more ancient word. Penpole 
Point in Somerset is an obvious example of this redoubling of 
names. The pre-Aryan place-names of the Aegean are much 
discussed by philologists. Such a name as Corinthos, with all 
other words in nthos, as hyacinthos, is thought to be pre-Hellenic. 
The river-names Gade, Ver, Test and many other monosyllabic 
river-names in the home counties, appear to be neither English 
nor Celtic, but have been neglected, being known to few but 
anglers and rustics. As to the meaning and nature of ancient 
local names, they are as a rule purely descriptive. A river is 
called by some word which merely signifies " the water "; a 
hill has a name which means no more than " the point," " the 
peak," " the castle." Celtic names are often of a more romantic 
tone, as Ardnamurchan, " the promontory by the great ocean," 
an admirable description of the bold and steep headland which 
breasts the wash of the Atlantic. As a general rule the surviving 
Celtic names, chiefly in Ireland, Wales and Scotland, all contain 
some wide meaning of poetic appropriateness. The English 
names, on the other hand, commonly state some very simple 
fact, and very frequently do no more than denote property, 
such and such a town or hamlet, " ton " or " ham," is the property 
of the Billings, Uffings, Tootings, or whoever the early English 
settlers in the district may have been. The same attachment 
to the idea of property is exhibited in even the local names of 
petty fields in English parishes. Occasionally one finds a bit of 
half-humorous description, as when a sour, starved and weedy 
plot is named " starvacre "; but more usually fields are. known 
as "Thompson's great field," "Smith's small field," "the 
fouracre," or the like. The name of some farmer or peasant 
owner or squatter of ancient date survives for centuries, attached 
to what was once his property. Thus the science of local names 
has a double historical value. The names indicate the various 
races (Celtic, Roman and English in Great Britain) who have 
set in the form of names the seal of their possession on the soil. 
Again, the meanings of the names illustrate the characters of 

1 Elton, Origins of English History, p. 165; Rhys, Lectures on 
Celtic Philology, pp. 181, 182. 



the various races. The Romans have left names connected 
with camps (castra, chesters) and military roads; the English 
have used simple descriptions of the baldest kind, or have ex- 
hibited their attachment to the idea of property; the Celtic 
names (like those which the red men have left in America, or 
the blacks in Australia) are musical with poetic fancy, and filled 
with interest in the aspects and the sentiment of nature. The 
British race carries with it the ancient names of an older people 
into every continent, and titles perhaps originally given to places 
in the British Isles by men who had not yet learned to polish 
their weapons of flint may now be found in Australia, America, 
Africa and the islands of the* farthest seas. Local names were 
originally imposed in a handy local manner. The settler or the 
group of cave-men styled the neighbouring river " the water," 
the neighbouring hill " the peak," and these terms often still 
survive in relics of tongues which can only be construed by the 
learned. 

Personal Names. — The history of personal names is longer 
and more complex, but proceeds from beginnings almost as 
simple. But in personal names the complexity of human 
character, and the gradual processes of tangling and disentangling 
the threads of varied human interest, soon come in, and per- 
sonal names are not imposed once and for all. Each man in 
very early societies may have many names, in different char- 
acters and at different periods of his life. The oldest personal 
names which we need examine here are those which indicate, 
not an individual, but a group, held together by the conscious 
sense or less conscious sentiment of kindred, or banded together 
for reasons of convenience. An examination of customs prevalent 
among the most widely separated races of Asia, Africa, Australia 
and America proves that groups conceiving themselves to be 
originally of the same kin are generally styled by the name 
of some animal or other object (animate or inanimate) from 
which they claim descent. This object is known as the " totem " 
(sec Totemism). The groups of supposed kin, however widely 
scattered in local distribution, are known as wolves, bears, 
turtles, suns, moons, cockatoos, reeds and what not, according 
as each group claims descent from this or that stock, and N some- 
times wears a mark representing this or that animal, plant or 
natural object. Unmistakable traces of the same habit of 
naming exist among Semitic and Teutonic races, and even among 
Greeks and Romans. The names chosen are commonly those 
of objects which can be easily drawn in a rude yet recognizable 
way, and easily expressed in the language of gesture. In addition 
to the totem names (which indicate, in each example, supposed 
blood-kindred), local aggregates of men received local names. 
We hear of the " hill-men," " the cave-men," " the bush-men," 
" the coast-men," the " men of the plain," precisely as in the 
old Attic divisions of Aktaioi, Pediaioi and so forth. When a 
tribe comes to recognize its own unity, as a rule it calls itself 
by some term meaning simply " the men," all other tribes being 
regarded as barbarous or inferior. Probably other neighbouring 
tribes also call themselves " the men " in another dialect or 
language, while the people in the neighbourhood are known 
by an opprobrious epithet, as Rakshasas among the early Aryan 
dwellers in India, or Eskimo (raw-eaters) in the far north of the 
American continent. Tribal names in Australia arc often taken 
from the tribal term for " yes " or " no "; cf. Languedoc. 

Leaving social for personal names, we find that, among most 
uncivilized races, a name (derived from some incident or natural 
object) is given at the time of birth by the parents of each new- 
born infant. Occasionally the name is imposed before the child 
is born, and the proud parents call themselves father and mother 
of such an one before the expected infant sees the light. In 
most cases the name (the earliest name) denotes some phenomenon 
of nature; thus Dobrizhofer met in the forests a young man 
styled " Gold flower of day," that is, " Dawn," his father 
having been named " Sun." Similar names are commonly 
given by the natives of Australia, while no names are more 
common among North-American Indians than those derived 
from sun, moon, cloud and wind. 

The names of savage persons are not permanent. The name 



i 5 8 



NAME 



first given is ordinarily changed (at the ceremony answering to 
confirmation in the church) for some more appropriate and. 
descriptive nickname, and that, again, is apt to be superseded 
by various " honour-giving names " derived from various 
exploits. The common superstition against being " named " 
has probably produced the custom by which each individual 
has a secret name and is addressed, when possible, by some 
wide term of kinship — "brother," "father" and the like. 
The bad luck which in Zulu customs as in Vedic myths attends 
the utterance of the real name is evaded by this system of 
addresses. Could we get a savage — an Iroquois, for example — 
to explain his titles, we would find that he is, say, " Morning 
Cloud " (by birth-name), " Hungry Wolf " (by confirmation 
name), " He that raises the white fellow's scalp " (by honour- 
giving name), of the Crane totem (by kinship and hereditary 
name, as understood by ourselves). When society grows so 
permanent that male kinship and paternity are recognized, the 
custom of patronymics is introduced. The totem name gives 
place to a gentile name, itself probably a patronymic in form; 
or, as in Greece, the gentile name gives place to a local name, 
derived from the deme. Thus a Roman is called Caius; Julius 
is his gentile name (of the Julian clan); Caesar is a kind of 
hereditary nickname. A Greek is Thucydides (the name usually 
derived from the grandfather), the son of Olorus, of the deme 
of Halimusia. 

This system of names answered the purposes of Greek and 
Roman civilization. In Europe, among the Teutonic races, the 
stock-names (conceivably totemistic in origin) survive in English 
local names, which speak of the " ton " or " ham " of the Billings 
or Tootings. An examination of these names, as collected in 
Kemble's Anglo-Saxons, proves that they were frequently derived 
from animals and plants. Such English names as " Noble 
Wolf " (Ethelwulf), " Wolf of War " and so forth, certainly 
testify to a somewhat primitive and fierce stage of society. 
Then came more vulgar nicknames and personal descriptions, 
as " Long," " Brown," " White " and so forth. Other names 
are directly derived from the occupation or craft (Smith, Fowler, 
Sadler) of the man to whom they were given, and yet other 
names were derived from places. The noble and landowner was 
called " of " such and such a place (the German von and French 
de). while the humbler man was called not " of " but " at " 
such a place, as in the name " Attewell," or merely by the local 
name without the particle. The " de " might also indicate 
merely the place of a person's birth or residence; it was not a 
proof of noblesse. If we add to these names patronymics formed 
by the addition of " son," and terms derived from Biblical 
characters (the latter adopted after the Reformation as a re- 
action against the names of saints in the calendar), we have 
almost exhausted the sources of modern English and European 
names. A continual development of custom can be traced, and 
the analysis of any man's family and Christian names will lead 
us beyond history into the manners of races devoid of literary 
records. (A. L.) 

Greek Names. — The Greeks had only one, and no family, name; 
hence the name of a child was left to the discretion of the parents. 
The eldest son generally took the name of his paternal grand- 
father, girls that of their grandmother. Genuine patronymics 
(Phocion, son of Phocus), analogous compounds (Theophrastus, 
son of Theodorus), or names of similar meaning (Philumenus, 
son of Eros) also occur. Athenaeus divides names generally into 
(i) 0eo<£6pa, chiefly derivatives or compounds of the names of 
gods (Demetrius, Apollonius, Theodorus, Diodotus, Heraclitus, 
Diogenes); (2) &0ea, simple or variously compounded names, 
especially such as were of good omen for a son's future career 
(Aristides, Pericles, Sophocles, Alexander), although such hopes 
were frequently belied by the results. Instances of a subsequent 
change of name are not uncommon; thus, Plato and Theo- 
phrastus were originally Aristocles and Tyrtamus. 

To obviate the ambiguity and confusion arising from the use 
of a single name, various expedients were adopted, the commonest 
being to add the father's name — ArjfxoaOevrjs ArjfiocOkvovs, 
'AXki^io&js 6 Kkeiviov. Sometimes the birthplace was added — 



*llp65oros 'AXiicapvatjtjevs, OovKv8i5r)$ 6 'Afrqvaios, and some- 
times the name of the deme (see Cleisthenes), e.g. A^/ttoo-^ei^v 
Uaiavevs, Nicknames denoting mental or bodily defects 
or striking peculiarities (e.g. colour of hair) were also favourite 
methods of discrimination (e.g. £av66s, yellow). 

Roman Names. — Towards the end of the republic free-born 
Romans were distinguished by three names and two (or even four) 
secondary indications. In an inscription the name of Cicero is 
given in the following form: M. Tullius M.f. M.n. M.pr. Cor(nelia 
tribu) Cicero. M (=Marcus) is the praenomen; Tullius, the 
nomen, the gentile or family name; Cicero, the cognomen. 
This order, always preserved, is the correct one. M.f. ( = Marci 
filius), M.n. (= Marci nepos), M.pr. ( = Marci pronepos),Cor(nelia 
tribu) are only used in formal description. 

Praenomen (corresponding to the modern Christian name). — 
Varro gives a list of 32 praenomina^ of which 14 had fallen out of use 
in Sulla's time, the remaining 18 being confined to patrician families, 
Some of these appear to nave been appropriated by particular 
families, e.g. Appius by the Claudii, Mamercus by the Aemilii. In 
the case of plebeian families there was greater latitude and a larger 
variety of names, but those which became ennobled followed the 
patrician usage. After the time of Sulla some of the old praenomina 
were revived, unless they are rather to be regarded as cognomina, 
which in some families displaced the praenomen proper, as in the case 
of a certain Africanus Aemilius Regulus. " 

The nomen (gentile, gentilicium) belonged to all the individual 
members of the gens and those in any way connected with it (wives, 
clients, freedmen). In patrician gentes the nomina nearly all ended in 
-ius (~aeus t ~eius t -eus), and are perhaps a sort of patronymic (Iulius 
from lulus). In some cases the name indicates the place of origin 
(Norbanus, Acerranus); -acus (Divitiacus) is peculiar to Gallic, 
~na (Caecina, Perperna) to Etruscan, -enus (Arulenus) to Umbrian 
names. Verres as a gentile name stands by itself; perhaps it was 
originally a cognomen. 

The cognomen ("surname") was the name given to a Roman 
citizen as a member of a famUia or branch of the gens t whereby the 
family was distinguished from other families belonging to the same 
gens. Cognomina were either of local origin (Calatinus, Sabinus) ; or 
denoted physical peculiarities or moral characteristics (Crassus, 
Longus, Lentulus, Lepidus, Calvus, Naso); or they were really 
praenomina (Cossus, Agrippa) or derivatives from praenomina or 
cogMww*wa(Sextinus,Corvinus,Laevinus). The tria nomina (" three 
names ") in the well-known passage of* Juvenal (v. 127) was 
probably a^t that time a mark of tngenuitas rather than of nobilitas. 

In addition to these three regular names, many Romans had a 
fourth, cognomen secundum (agnomen was an introduction of the 
grammarians of the 4th century). These " second surnames " were 
chiefly bestowed in recognition of great achievements— Asiaticus, 
Africanus, Creticus, or were part of the terminology in cases of 
adoption. ' 

Persons adopted took all thethree names of their adoptive father, 
but at the same time, to keep his origin in mind, they added a second 
cognomen t a derivative in -anus or -inus from his old gentile name ; 
thus, Publius Cornelius Scipio Aemilianus, son of Lucius Aemilius 
Paullus, adopted by Publius Cornelius Scipio. After the time of 
Sulla, the derivative was no longer used, one of the old names being 
substituted without change — Marcus Terentius Varro ' Lucullus. 
Under the empire no fixed rule was observed, the most remarkable 
thing being the very large number of names borne by one person (as 
many as 36 occur on an inscription). Especially in the army and 
amongst the lower orders, nicknames (signa t vocabula) are of frequent 
occurrence. Well-known examples are: Caligula; cedo alteram 
(" another stick, please! "), given to a centurion of flogging pro- 
pensities; manus ad ferrum ( hand on sword,") of Aurelian when 
tribune. v 

Women originally took the name of the head of the family — 
Caecilia (filia) Metelli, Metella Crassi (uxor). Later, f. (=*filia) was 
added after the name of a daughter. Towards the end of the republic 
women are denoted by their gentile name alone,"* while under the 
empirethey always have two — the nomen and cognomen of the father 
(Aemilia Lepida, daughter of Lucius Aemilius Lepidus Paullus), or 
the nomen of both father and mother (Valeria Attia, daughter of 
Attius Atticus and Valeria Sextina). 

Slaves originally had no name, but simply took their master's 
praenomen in the genitive followed by -por ( = puer): Marcipor, 
Publipor, Quintipor. Later, when the number of slaves was largely 
increased, by way of distinction names similar to those common in 
Greece (national, physical or moral qualities) or simply foreign names 
were given them. The word puer was subsequently replaced by 
servus and the form of the name ran: Aphrodisius Ploti Gai servus; 
under the empire, Eleutherus C. Julii Florentini (the natural order 
being preserved in the master's name). When a slave exchanged 
one master for another, he adopted the name of his old master in an 
adjectival form in -anus: Cissus Caesaris (servus) Maecenatianus 
(formerly a slave of Maecenas). Freedmen used their own name as 
a cognomen and took the nomen of him who gave them their freedom 



NAMUR

and any praenomen they pleased: L. Livius Andronicus, freedman 
of M. Livius Salinator. In the time of Caesar, the freedman took the 
praenomen of the patronus and the gentile name of one of the friends 
of the latter; thus, Cicero calls his slave Dionysius M. Pomponius 
Dionysius as a token of friendship for T, Pomponius Atticus. 

Q. H. F.) 

Law. — The Christian name, i.e. the name given to a person on 
admission to baptism into the Christian church, dates back to the 
early history of the Church. It has been said that the practice 
of giving a name on baptism was possibly imitated from the 
Jewish custom of giving a personal name at circumcision. In 
England individuals were for long distinguished by Christian 
names only, and the surname (see below) or family name is still 
totally ignored by the Church. As population increased and 
intercourse became general, it became necessary to employ some 
further name by which one man might be known from another, 
and in process of time the use of surnames became universal, the 
only exceptions in England being the members of the royal 
family, who sign by their baptismal names only. 

Where the ecclesiastical law does not come into conflict with the 
common law or has not been changed by it, it still prevails, and 
therefore it may be said that the name given at baptism may be 
regarded as practically unalterable. But that a baptismal. name is 
not altogether unalterable has been a matter of contention. A 
constitution of Archbishop Peckham (ob. 1292) directs that" ministers 
shall take care not to permit wanton names to be given to children 
baptized^ and if otherwise it be done, the same shall be changed 
by the bishop at confirmation." And before the Reformation the 
Office for Confirmation must have contemplated the possibility of 
such a change, as the bishop is directed therein to ask the child's 
name before anointing him with the chrism, and afterwards, naming 
him, to sign him with the cross. But in the second and subsequent 
Prayer-books all mention of the name in the Office for Confirmation 
is omitted. Lord Coke was of opinion that such a change was 
permissible and gives examples (i^ Inst, p.^ 3), but Dr Burn (Ecc. 
Law, i. 80) held a contrary opinion. Phillimore, however, gives 
several instances when such a change was made, one, in the diocese 
of Liverpool, on the nth of June 1886 (see Phillimore, Ecc. Law, 
i. 517, 518; and also Notes and Queries, 4th ser. vol. vi. p. 17, 7th 
ser. vol. ii. p. 17). In the case of those who have not been baptized, but 
have a name (other than a surname) given them by their parents, 
such a name acquires force only by repute. The Registration of 
Births^ Act, which requires the registration of every^ birth, makes 
provision for the insertion of a name, but such provision is purely 
permissive, and the^ only object of entering a name on the register 
is to have an authoritative record of the commencement of repute. 

A clergyman of the Church of England is compelled to perform the 
ceremony of baptism when required by a parishioner, and to give 
whatever name or names the godparents select, but although the 
rubrics do not expressly say so, he can object to any name on religious 
or moral grounds. _ 

The freedom enjoyed in England and the United States as to the 
kind of Christian name which may be given to a child is somewhat 
limited in France and Germany. In France, by a decree of the # 11 
Germinal, an XI., the only names permitted to be recorded in the civil 
register as Christian names (prenoms) of children were those of 
saints in the calendar and the names of personages known in ancient 
history. Even at the present day an official list is issued (revised 
from time to time) containing a selection of forenames, and no 
name of a child will be registered unless it occurs in this list. A 
limitation more or less similar prevails in Germany and other 
European countries. 

As regards the surname (Fr. surnom, name in addition), custom 
has universally decreed that a man shall be known by the name 
of his father. But in England and the United States, at least, this 
custom is not legally binding; there is no law preventing a man 
from taking whatever name he has a fancy for, nor are there any 
particular Formalities required to be observed on adopting a fresh 
surname; but, on the other hand, if a man has been known for a 
considerable time by the name of his father, or by a name of repute, 
and he changes it for another, he cannot compel others to address 
him or designate him by the new one. Neither does the English 
law recognize the absolute right of any person in any particular name 
to the extent of preventing another person from assuming it (Du 
Boulay v. Du Boulay, 1869, L.R. 2 P.C. 430). If, however, a person 
adopts a new name and wishes to have it publicly notified and recog- 
nized in official circles, the method of procedure usually adopted 
is that by royal licence. This is by petition, prepared and presented 
through the Heralds' Office. If granted, the royal licence is given 
under the sign manual and privy seal of the sovereign, counter- 
signed by the home secretary. In wills and settlements a clause is 
often inserted whereby a testator or settler imposes upon the takers 
of the estate an obligation to assume his name and bear his arms. 
The stamp duty payable for a royal licence in this case is fifty 
pounds, but if the application is merely voluntary the stamp duty 
is ten pounds. Where there is a more formal adoption of a surname, 



it is usual, for purposes of publicity and evidence, to advertise the 
change of name in the newspapers and to execute a deed poll setting 
out the change, and enrol the same in the central office of the Supreme 
Court. 

Both in France and Germany official authorization must be ob- 
tained for any change of name. By the German Code 1900 (s. 12) 
if the right to a new name is disputed by another or his interest is 
injured thereby, the person entitled can compel the abandonment 
of the new name. 

In England, a wife on marriage adopts the surname of her husband, 
disregarding entirely her maiden surname; in Scotland the practice 
usually is for the wife to retain her maiden name for all legal purposes, 
adding the name of her husband as an alias. On remarriage the rule 
is for the wife to adopt the name of the new husband, but an ex- 
ception to this is tacitly recognized in the case of a title acquired by 
marriage when the holder remarries a commoner. This exception 
was very fully discussed in Cowley v. Cowley, 190 1, A.C. 450. 

Peers of the United Kingdom when signing their names use only 
their surnames or peerage designations. It is merely a privileged 
custom, which does not go back further than the Stuart period. 
Peeresses sign by their Christian names or initials followed by their 
peerage designation. Bishops sign by their initials followed by 
the name of the see. In Scotland it is very usual for landowners 
to affix to their names the designation of their lands, and this was 
expressly sanctioned by an act of 1672.

NAMUR, one of the nine provinces of Belgium. It lies between 
Hainaut on the one side and Liege and Luxemburg on the other, 
and extends from Brabant up the Meuse valley to the French 
frontier. Area, 1414 sq. m.; pop. (1904) 357,759. The part 
north of the Meuse is very fertile, but the rest is covered with 
forest and is little suited for agriculture. There are a few iron 
and coal-mines between the Sambre and Meuse, and the quarries 
are of great importance. Arboriculture, and especially fruit-tree 
plantation, is on the increase. The province is divided into 
the three arrondissements of Namur, Dinant and Philippeville, 
and there are fifteen cantons for judicial purposes. 

NAMUR (Flemish, Namen), a town of Belgium, capital of 
the province of Namur. Pop. (1904) 31,940. It is most pictur- 
esquely situated at the junction of the rivers Sambre and Meuse, 
the town lying on the left banks of the two rivers, while the rocky 
promontory forming the fork between them is crowned with the 
old citadel. This citadel is no longer used for military purposes, 
and the hill on which it stands has been converted into a public 
park, while the crest is occupied by an enormous hotel to which 
access is gained by a cogwheel railway. Namur is connected 
with the citadel by two bridges across the Sambre, and from the 
east side of the promontory there is a fine stone bridge to the 
suburb of Jambes. This bridge was constructed in the nth 
century and rebuilt in the reign of Charles V. It is the only old 
bridge in existence over the Meuse in the Belgian portion of its 
course. The cathedral of St Aubain or Albin was built in the 
middle of the 18th century. The church of St Loup is a century 
older, and is noticeable for its columns of red marble from the 
quarry at St Remy near Rochefort. There is a considerable local 
industry in cutlery, and there are numerous tanneries along the 
river-side. 

The hill of the citadel is perhaps identical with Aduaticum, 
the fortified camp of the Aduatici captured and destroyed by 
Julius Caesar after the defeat of the Nervii, although many 
authorities incline to the plateau of Hast6don, north of the 
Sambre and of Namur itself, as the more probable site of the 
Belgic position. Many antiquities of the Roman-Gallic period 
have been discovered in the neighbourhood and are preserved 
in the local archaeological museum. Here also are deposited the 
human fossils of the Stone Age discovered at Furfooz on the Lesse. 
In the feudal period Namur was always a place of some import- 
ance, and long formed a marquisate in the Courtenay family. 
One institution of the medieval period came down to modern 
times, and was only discontinued in consequence of the fatalities 
with which it was generally accompanied. This was the annual 
encounter on the Place d'Armes of rival parties mounted on 
stilts. Galliot, the historian of Namur, says the origin of these 
jousts is lost in antiquity, but considers the use of stilts was due

to the frequency with which the town was flooded before the 
rivers were embanked. Don John of Austria made Namur his 
headquarters during the greater part of his stay in the Nether- 
lands, and died here in 1578. As -a fortress Namur did not 
attain the first rank until after its capture by Louis XIV. in 
1692, when Vauban endeavoured to make it impregnable; but 
it was retaken by William III, in 1695. The French recaptured 
it in 1 702 and retained possession for ten years. In 1 8 1 5 Marshal 
Grouchy on his retreat into France fought an action here with 
the Prussians under General Pirch. In 1888, under the new 
scheme of Belgian defence, the citadel and its detached works 
were abandoned, and in their place nine outlying forts were 
constructed at a distance of from 3 to 5 m. round the town. 
All these forts are placed on elevated points. They are in their 
order, beginning on the left bank of the Meuse and ending on 
the right bank of the same river: (1) St Heribert, (2) Malonne, 
(3) Suarlee, (4) Emines, (5) Cognclee, (6) Gelbressee, (7) Maizeret, 
(8) Andoy and (9) Dave. The whole position is correctly de- 
scribed as the " t£te de pont " of Namur, and in addition to its 
strong bomb-proof forts it possesses great natural advantages for 
the defence of the intervals. 

NANA FARNA VIS (1 741-1800), the great Mahratta minister 
at Poona at the end of the 18th century. His real name was 
Balaji Janardhan Bhanu; but, like many other Mahrattas, he 
was always known by a kind of nickname. Nana properly means 
a maternal grandfather; Farnavis is the official title of the 
finance minister, derived from fard— an account and navis — 
a writer. He was born at Satara on the 4th of May 1741, and 
was the son of a Chitpavan Brahman, of the same class as the 
Peshwa, who held the hereditary office of Farnavis.' He escaped 
from the fatal battle of Panipat in 1761; and from about 1774 
was the leading personage in directing the affairs of the Mahratta 
confederacy, though never a soldier. This was the period when 
Peshwas rapidly succeeded one another, and there was more 
than one disputed succession. It was the policy of Nana Farnavis 
to hold together the confederacy against both internal dissensions 
and the growing power of the British. He died at Poona on 
the 13th of March 1800, just before the Peshwa placed himself 
in the hanJs of the British and thus broke up the Mahratta 
confederacy. In an extant letter to the Peshwa, the Marquess 
Wellesley thus describes him: " The able minister of your state, 
whose upright principles and honourable views and whose zeal 
for the welfare and prosperity both of the dominions of his own 
immediate superiors and of other powers were so justly cele- 
brated." 

See Captain A. Macdonald, Memoir of Nana Furnuwees (Bombay, 
1851). 

NANAIMO, a city of British Columbia, on the east coast of 
Vancouver Island. Pop. (1906) about 6500. It is connected 
with Victoria by the Esquimalt and Nanaimo railway, and has 
a daily steamer service to Vancouver, as well as to Comox, 
Sydney and other points on the coast. It is favourably situated 
for growing fruit, and mixed farming is carried on to a consider- 
able extent. There is a large export trade in coal from the 
neighbouring mines, which is sent chiefly to San Francisco. 

NANA SAHIB, the common designation of Dandu Panth, an 
adopted son of the ex-peshwa of the Mahrattas, Baji Rao, 
who took a leading part in the great Indian Mutiny, and was 
proclaimed peshwa by the mutineers. Nana Sahib had a griev- 
ance against the British government because they refused to 
continue to him the pension of eight lakhs of rupees (£80,000) 
which was promised to Baji Rao by Sir John Malcolm on his 
surrender in 1818. This pension, however, was only intended 
to be a life grant to Baji Rao himself. For this refusal the Nana 
bore the British a lifelong grudge, which he washed out in the 
blood of women and children in the massacres at Cawnpore. 
In 1859, when the remnants of the rebels disappeared into 
Nepal, the Nana was among the fugitives. His death was reported 
some time afterwards, but his real fate remains obscure. 

NANCY, a town of north-eastern France, the capital formerly 
of the province of Lorraine, and now of the department of 
Meurthe-et-Moselle, 219 m. E. of Paris on the railway to Strass- 



burg. Pop. (1906), town, 98,302; commune (including troops), 
110,570. Nancy is situated on the left bank of the Meurthe 
6 m. above its junction with the Moselle and on the Marne- 
Rhine canal. The railway from Paris to Strassburg skirts the 
city on the south-west side; other railways — to Metz, to fipinal 
by Mirecourt, to Chateau Salins — join the main fine near Nancy, 
and make it an important junction. The town consists of two 
portions — the Ville-Vieille in the north-west between the Cours 
Leopold and the Pepiniere gardens, with narrow and winding 
streets, and the Ville-Neuve in the south-east with wide straight 
streets, allowing views of the hills around the city. Between the 
two lies, the Place Stanislas, a square worthy of a capital city: 
in the centre stands the statue of Stanislas Leczinski, ruler of 
Lorraine, and on all sides rise imposing buildings in the 18th- 
century style — the town hall, episcopal palace, theatre, &c. 
A fine triumphal arch erected by Stanislas in honour of Louis XV. 
leads from the Place Stanislas to the Place Carriere, which forms 
a beautiful tree-planted promenade, containing at its further end 
the government palace (1760) now the residence of the general 
commanding the XX, army corps, and adjoins the so-called 
Pepiniere (nursery) established by Stanislas. Other open spaces 
in the city are the Place d'Alliance^ (formed by Stanislas, with 
a fountain 'in memory of the alliance between Louis XV. 
and Maria Theresa in 1756), the Place de PAcademie, 
the Place St Epvre with a statue of Duke Ren6 II. , the 
Place Dombasle and the Place de Thiers, the two latter 
embellished with the statues of Mathieu Dombasle, the agri- 
culturist, and Adolphe Thiers. The cathedral in the Ville- 
Neuve, built in the 18th century, has a wide facade flanked by 
two dome-surmounted towers, and a somewhat frigid and sombre 
interior. Of particular interest is the church of the Cordeliers, in 
the old town, built by Rene II. about 1482 to commemorate his 
victory over Charles the Bold. Pillaged during the Revolution 
period, but restored to religious uses in 1825, it contains the 
tombs of Antony of Vaudemont and his wife Marie d'Harcourt, 
Philippe of Gueldres, second wife of Rene II., Henry III., count 
of Vaudemont, and Isabella of Lorraine his wife, Rene II. (a 
curious monument raised by his widow in 1515) and Cardinal 
de Vaudemont (d. 1587). Here also is a chapel built at the 
beginning of the 1 7th century to receive the tombs of the princes 
of the house of Lorraine. The church of St Epvre, rebuilt 
between 1864 and 1874 on the site of an old church of the 13th, 
14th and 15th centuries, has a fine spire and belfry and good 
stained glass windows. Bonsecours Church, at the end of the 
St Pierre Faubourg, contains the mausoleums of Stanislas (by 
whom it was built) and his wife Catherine, and the heart of their 
daughter Marie, queen of France, as well as the statue of Notre- 
Dame de Bonsecours, the object of a well-known pilgrimage. 
Of the old ducal palace, begun in the 15th century by Duke 
Raoul and completed by Ren6 II., there remains but a single wing, 
partly rebuilt after a fire in 1871. The entrance to this wing, 
which contains the archaeological museum of Lorraine, is a 
beautiful specimen of the late Gothic of the beginning of the 
1 6th century. One of the greatest treasures of the collection is 
the tapestry found in the tent of Charles the Bold after the 
battle of Nancy. Of the old gates of Nancy the most ancient 
and remarkable is the Porte de la Craffe (1463). The town hall 
contains a museum of painting and sculpture, and there is a rich 
municipal library. A monument to President Carnot, and 
statues of Jacques Callot, the engraver, and of General Drouot, 
both natives of Nancy, and of Claude Gellee stand in various 
parts of the town. 

Nancy is the seat of a bishop, a prefect, a court of appeal and 
a court of assizes, headquarters of the XX. army corps, and centre 
of an acadhnie (educational division) with a university comprising 
faculties of law, medicine, science and letters, and a higher school 
of pharmacy. There are also tribunals of first instance and of 
commerce, a board of trade-arbitrators, lycees and training 
colleges for both sexes, a higher ecclesiastical seminary, a school 
of agriculture, the national school of forestry, a higher school 
of commerce, a technical school {tcole professionndle), a school of 
arts and crafts (icole prtparaloire des arts et metiers), a chamber

of commerce and a branch of the Bank of France. The industries 
of Nancy include printing, brewing, cotton- and wool-spinning 
and the weaving of cotton and woollen goods, and the manufacture 
of tobacco (by the State), of boots and shoes, straw hats, pottery, 
casks, embroidery, machinery, engineering material, farm im- 
plements and iron goods. 

At the close of. the nth century Odelric of Nancy, brother 
of Gerard of Alsace, possessed at Nancy a castle which enabled 
him to defy the united assaults of the bishops of Metz and Treves 
and the count of Bar. In the 12th century the town was sur- 
rounded with walls, and became the capital of the dukes of 
Lorraine; but its real importance dates from the 15th century, 
when on the 5th cf January 1477 Charles the Bold was defeated 
by Rene II. and perished at its gates. 1 Enlarged, embellished 
and admirably refortified by Charles III., it was taken by the 
French in 1633 (Louis XIII. and Richelieu being present at the 
siege). After the peace of Ryswick in 1697 it was restored and 
Duke Leopold set himself to repair the disasters of the past. 
He founded academies, established manufactures and set 
about the construction of the new town. But it was reserved 
for Stanislas Leczinski, to whom Lorraine and Bar were assigned 
in 1 736, to carry out the plans of improvement in a style which 
made Nancy one of the palatial cities of Europe, and rendered 
himself the most popular as he was the last of the dukes of 
Lorraine. The city, which became French in 1766, was occupied 
by the allies in 1814 and 181 5, and put to ransom by the Prussians 
in 1870. After the Franco-German war the population was 
greatly increased by the immigration of Alsatians and of people 
from Metz and its district.

Histoire physique, civile, morale et politique de Nancy (Nancy, 1846). 

NANDAIR, or Nander, a town of India, in the state of 
Hyderabad, on the left bank of the Godaveri, with a station 
on the Hyderabad-Godaveri valley railway, 174 m. N.E. of 
Hyderabad city. Pop. (1901) 14,184. It is a centre of local 
trade, with a special industry of j&ne muslin and gold bordered 
scarves. As the scene of the murder of Guru Govind, it contains 
a shrine visited by Sikhs from all parts of India. 

NANDGAON, a feudatory state of India, in the Chhattisgarh 
division of the Central Provinces. Area, 871 sq. m.; pop. 
(1901) 126,356, showing a decrease of 31% in the decade, due 
to famine; estimated revenue £23,000; tribute £4600. The 
state has a peculiar history. Its foundation is traced to a religious 
celibate, who came from the Punjab towards the end of the 18th 
century. From the founder it passed through a succession of 
chosen disciples until 1879, when the British government 
recognized the ruler as an hereditary chief and afterwards 
conferred upon his son the title of Raja Bahadur. The state 
has long been well administered, and has derived additional 
prosperity from the construction of the Bengal-Nagpur railway, 
which has a station at Raj-Nandgaon, the capital (pop. 11,094). 
Here there is a steam cotton mill. 

NANDI, an East African tribe of mixed Nilotic, Bantu and 
Hamitic origin. With them are more or less closely allied the 
Lumbwa (correctly Kipsikis), Buret (or Puret) and Sotik 
(Soot) tribes, as well as the Elgonyi (properly Kony) of Mount 
Elgon. They have also affinities with the Masai tribes. The 
Nandi-Lumbwa peoples inhabit the country stretching south 
from Mount Elgon to about i° S. and bounded east by the escarp- 
ment of the eastern rift -valley and west by the territory of the 
tribes, such as the Kavirondo, dwelling round the Victoria 
Nyanza. They have given their name to the Nandi plateau. 
The Hamitic strain in these allied tribes is derived from the Galla; 
they also exhibit Pygmy elements. Their original home was 
in the north, and they probably did not reach their present home 
until the beginning of the 1 9th century. They differ considerably 

1 The battle raged in the district to the S., E. and N. of the town, 
the operations extending from St Nicolas du Port (S.) to the bridge 
of Bouxieres (N.). The chief struggle took place on the banks of the 
stream of Bon Secours, which now runs entirely underground, 
flowing from the S.W. into the Meurthe. Much of the battlefield is 
now covered by modern buildings, but S.W. of the town a cross 
marks the spot where the body of Charles the Bold was discovered.

in physical appearance; some resemble the Masai, being men 
of tall stature with features almost Caucasian, other are dwarfish 
with markedly negro features. Like the Masai, Turkana and 
Suk, the Nandi-Lumbwa tribes were originally nomadic, but they 
have become agriculturists. They own large herds of cattle. 
They have a double administrative system, the chief medicine 
man or Orkoiyot being supreme chief and regulating war affairs, 
while representatives of the people, called Kiruogik, manage 
the ordinary affairs of the tribe. The medicine men are of 
Masai origin and the office is hereditary. The young men form 
a separate warrior class to whom is entrusted the care of the 
country. A period of about 7! years is spent in this class, and 
the ceremony of handing over the country from one " age " 
to the succeeding " age " is of great importance. The arms of 
the warriors are a stabbing spear, shield, sword and club. Many 
also possess rifles. All the Nandi are divided into clans, each 
having its sacred animal or totem. They have no towns, each 
family living on the land it cultivates. The huts are of circular 
pattern. The Nandi believe in a supreme deity — Asis — who 
takes a benevolent interest in their welfare, and to whom 
prayers are addressed daily. They also worship ancestors and 
consider earthquakes to be caused by the spirits moving in the 
underworld. They practise circumcision, and girls undergo 
a similar operation. Spitting is a sign of blessing. Their scanty 
clothing consists chiefly of dressed skins. The tribal mark is 
a small hole bored in the upper part of the ear. Their language 
is Nilotic and in general construction resembles the Masai. 
It has been slightly influenced by the Somali tongue. The 
primitive hunting tribe known as the Wandorobo speak a 
dialect closely resembling Nandi. 

The Nandi at one time appear to have been subject to the 
Masai, but when the country was first known to Europeans 
they were independent and occupied the plateau which bears 
their name. Hardy mountaineers and skilful warriors, they 
closed their territory to all who did not get special permission, 
and thus blocked the road from Mombasa to Uganda alike to 
Arab and Swahili. Caravans that escaped the Masai frequently 
fell victims to the Nandi, who were adepts at luring them to 
destruction. When the railway to the Victoria Nyanza was 
built it had to cross the Nandi country. The tribesmen, who 
had already shown hostility to the whites, attacked both the 
railway and the telegraph line and raided other tribes. Eventually 
(1 905-1 906) the NancU were removed by the British to reserves 
somewhat north of the railway zone (sec British East Africa). 
The Lumbwa reserve lies south of the railway, and farther south 
still are the reserves of the Buret and Sotik.

introduction by Sir Charles Eliot (Oxford, 1909), and the works 
there cited. 

NANDIDRUG, a hill fortress of southern India, in the Kolar 
district of Mysore, 4851 ft. above the sea. It was traditionally 
held impregnable) and its storming by Lord Cornwallis in 1791 
was one of the most notable incidents of the first war against 
Tippoo Sultan. It was formerly a favourite resort for British 
officials during the hot season. 

• NANGA, the most primitive form of the ancient Egyptian 
harp. The nanga consisted of a boat-shaped or vaulted body of 
wood, the back of which was divided down the centre by a sound 
bar built into the back; on this bar was fixed a cylindrical stick 
round which one end of the strings was wound, the soundboard 
or parchment being stretched over the back without interfering 
with the stick. The other end of the strings was fastened to pegs 
set in the side of a curved neck, so that the strings did not lie 
directly over the soundboard. There were but 3 or 4 strings, one 
note only being obtained from each. Some of these nangas are 
to be seen at the British Museum. 

NANKEEN, a cotton cloth originally made in China, and now 
imitated in various countries. The name is derived from 
Nanking, the city in which the cloth is said to have been originally 
manufactured. The characteristic yellowish colour of nankeen 
is attributed to the peculiar colour of the cotton from which it 
was originally made.

NANKING— NANSEN, F. 



NANKING (" the southern capital "), the name by which 
Kiang-ning, the chief city in the province of Kiangsu, China, has 
been known for several centuries. Pop. about 140,000. The 
city stands in 32 5' N., 118 47' E., nearly equidistant between 
Canton and Peking, on the south bank of the Yangtsze Kiang. 
It dates only from the beginning of the Ming dynasty (1368), 
although it is built on the site of a city which for more than two 
thousand years figured under various names in the history of the 
empire. The more ancient city was originally known as Kin-ling; 
under the Han dynasty (206 B.C. to a.d. 25) its name was con- 
verted into Tan-yang; by the T'ang emperors (a.d. 618-907) 
it was styled Kiang-nan and Sbeng Chow; by the first sovereign 
of the Ming dynasty (a.d. 1368-1644) it was created the " southern 
capital " (Nan-king), and was given the distinctive name of 
Ying-t'ien; and since the accession to power of the present 
Manchu rulers it has been officially known as Kiang-ning, 
though still popularly called Nan-king. It was the seat of the 
imperial court only during the reigns of the first two emperors of 
the Ming dynasty, and was deserted for Shun-t'ien (Peking) by 
Yung-lo, the third sovereign of that line, who in 1403 captured 
the town and usurped the crown of his nephew, the reigning 
emperor. 

The T'aip'ing rebels, who carried the town by assault in 
1853, swept away all the national monuments and most of the 
more conspicuous public buildings it contained, and destroyed the 
greater part of the magnificent wall which surrounded it. This 
wall is said by Chinese topographers to have been 96 li, or 32 m., 
in circumference. This computation has, however, been shown 
to be a gross exaggeration, and it is probable that 60 li, or 20 m., 
would be nearer the actual dimensions. The wall, of which only 
small portions remain, was about 70 ft. in height, measured 30 ft. 
in thickness at the base, and was pierced by thirteen gates. 
Encircling the north, east, and south sides of the city proper was a 
second wall which enclosed about double the space of the inner 
enclosure. In the north-east corner of the town stood the 
imperial palace reared by Hung-wu, the imperial founder of the 
modern city. After suffering mutilation at the overthrow of the 
Ming dynasty, this magnificent building was burnt to the ground 
on the recapture of the city from the T'aip'ing rebels in 1864. 
But beyond comparison the most conspicuous public building at 
Nanking was the famous porcelain tower, which was designed 
by the emperor Yung-lo (1403-14 28) to commemorate the 
virtues of his mother. Twelve centuries previously an Indian 
priest deposited on the spot where this monument afterwards 
stood a relic of Buddha, and raised over the sacred object a small 
pagoda of three stories in height. During the disturbed times 
which heralded the close of the Yuen dynasty (1368) this pagoda 
was utterly destroyed. It was doubtless out of respect to the relic, 
which then perished that Yung-lo chose this site for the erection 
of his " token-of-gratitude " pagoda. The building was begun 
in 1413. But before it was finished Yung-lo had passed away, 
and it was reserved for his successor to see the final pinnacle 
fixed in its place, after nineteen years had been consumed in 
carrying out the designs of the imperial architect. In shape the 
pagoda was an octagon, and was about 260 ft. in height, or, as 
the Chinese say, with that extraordinary love for inaccurate 
accuracy which is peculiar to them, 32 chang (a chang equals 
about 1 20 in.) 9 ft. 4 in. and -fa of an inch. The outer walls were 
cased with bricks of the finest white porcelain, and each of the 
nine stories into which the building was divided was marked by 
overhanging eaves composed of green glazed tiles of the same 
material. The summit was crowned with a gilt ball fixed on the 
top of an iron rod, which in its turn was encircled by nine iron 
rings. Hung on chains which stretched from this apex to the 
eaves of the roof were five large pearls of good augury for the 
safety of the city. One was supposed to avert floods, another 
to prevent fires, a third to keep dust-storms at a distance, a 
fourth to allay tempests, and a fifth to guard the city 
against disturbances. From the eaves of the several stories 
there hung one hundred and fifty-two bells and countless 
lanterns. In bygone days Nanking was one of the chief 
literary centres of the empire, besides being famous for 



its manufacturing industries. Satin, crape, nankeen, cloth, 
paper, pottery, and artificial flowers were among its chief 
products. 

At Nanking, after its capture by British ships in 1842, Sir 
Henry Pottinger signed the " Nanking treaty." It was made a 
treaty port by the French treaty of 1858, but was not formally 
opened. Its proximity to Chinkiang, where trade had established 
itself while Nanking was still in the hands of the rebels, made its 
opening of little advantage, and the point was not pressed. In 
1899 it was voluntarily thrown open to foreign trade by the 
Chinese government, and in 1909 it was connected by railway 
(192 m. long) with Shanghai. 

Since 1880 Nanking has been slowly recovering from the ruin 
caused by the T'aip'ing rebellion. Barely one-fourch of the area 
within the walls has been reoccupied, and though its ancient 
industries are reviving, no great progress has been made. As the 
seat of the provincial government of Kiang-nan, however, 
which embraces the three provinces of Kiang-su, Kiang-si, 
and Ngan-hui, Nanking is a city of first-class importance. The 
viceroy of Kiang-nan is the most powerful of all the provincial 
satraps, as he controls a larger revenue than any other, and has 
the command of larger forces both naval and military. He is 
also superintendent of foreign trade for the southern ports, 
including Shanghai, a position which gives him great weight in 
all political questions. The city contains an arsenal for the 
manufacture of munitions of war, also powder-mills. A naval 
college was opened in 1800, and an imperial military college a 
few years later under foreign instructors. The only foreign 
residents are missionaries (mostly American), and employes of 
the Chinese government. The only remaining features of interest 
in Nanking are the so-called Ming Tombs, being the mausolea 
of Hung-wu, the founder of the Ming dynasty, and of one or two 
of his successors, which lie outside the eastern wall of the city. 
They are ill cared for and rapidly going to decay. Since 1899 the 
foreign trade has shown a steady increase. 

NANNING. a treaty port in the province of Kwangsi, China, 
on the West river, 250 m. above Wuchow and 470 m. from 
Canton. Pop. about 40,000. It is the highest point accessible 
for steam traffic on the West river. From Canton to Wuchow 
the river has a minimum depth of 8 ft., but on the section from 
Wuchow to Nanning not more than 3 or 4 ft. are found during 
winter. The town is the chief market on the southern frontier. 
Its opening was long opposed by the French government, who 
had acquired the right to build a railway to it from Tongking, 
by which they hoped to divert the trade through their own 
possessions. Navigation by small native boats is open west- 
wards as far as Paise. 

NANSEN, FRIDTJOF (1861- ), Norwegian scientist, ex- 
plorer and statesman, was born at Froen near Christiania on 
the 10th of October 1861. His childhood was spent at this place 
till his fifteenth year, when bis parents removed to Christiania, 
where he" went to school. He entered Christiania university in 
1880, where he made a special study of zoology; in March 1882 
he joined the sealing-ship " Viking " for a voyage to Greenland 
waters. On his return in the same year he was appointed 
curator of the Bergen Museum, under the eminent physician 
and zoologist Daniel Cornelius Danielssen (1815-1894). In 1886 
he spent a short time at the zoological station at Naples. During 
this time he wrote several papers and memoirs on zoological and 
histological subjects, and for one paper on " The Structure and 
Combination of the Histological Elements of the Central Nervous 
System " (Bergen, 1887) the Christiania university conferred 
upon him the degree of doctor of philosophy. But his voyage in 
the " Viking " had indicated Greenland as a possible field for 
exploration, and in 1887 he set about preparations for a crossing 
of the great ice-field which covers the interior of that country. 
The possibility of his success was discountenanced by many 
Arctic authorities, and a small grant he had asked for was refused 
by the Norwegian government, but was provided by Augustin 
Gamel, a merchant of Copenhagen, while he paid from his private 
means the greater part of the expenses of the expedition. As 
companions Nansen had Otto Neumann Sverdrup (b. 1855), 



NANSEN, H. 



163 



Captain O. C. Dietrichson (b. 1856), a third compatriot, and 
two Lapps. The expedition started in May 1888, proceeding 
from Leith to Iceland, and there joining a sealing-ship bound 
for the east coast of Greenland. On the 17th of July Nansen 
decided to leave the ship and force a way through the ice-belt 
to the land, about 10 m. distant, but the party encountered 
great difficulties owing to ice-pressures, went adrift with the ice, 
and only reached the land on the 29th, having been carried far 
to the south in the interval. They made their way north again, 
along the coast inside the drift ice, and on the 16th of August 
began the ascent of the inland ice. Suffering severely from 
storms, intense cold, and other hardships, they reached the 
highest point of the journey (8920 ft.) on the 5th of September, 
and at the end of the month struck the west coast at the Ameralik 
Fjord. On reaching the settlement of Godthaab it was found 
that the party must winter there, and Nansen used the oppor- 
tunity to study the Eskimos and gather material for his book, 
Eskimo Life (English translation, London, 1893). The party 
returned home in May 1889, and Nansen 's book, The First 
Crossing of Greenland (English translation, London, 1890), 
demonstrates the valuable scientific results of the journey. A 
report of the scientific results was published in Petermanns 
Mitteilungen (Gotha, 1892). On his return from Greenland 
Nansen accepted the curatorship of the Zootomic Museum of 
Christiania university. In September 1889 he married Eva, 
daughter of Professor Michael Sars of Christiania university, 
and a noted singer (d. 1907). 

In 1890 he propounded his scheme for a polar expedition 
before the Norwegian Geographical Society, and in 1892 he 
laid it before the Royal Geographical Society in London (see 
" How can the North Polar Region be crossed ?" Geogr. Journal, 
vol. i.), by which time his preparations were well advanced. 
His theory, that a drift-current sets across the polar regions 
from Bering Strait and the neighbourhood of the New Siberia 
Islands towards the east coast of Greenland, was based on a 
number of indications, notably the discovery (1884), on drift 
ice off the south-west coast of Greenland, of relics of the American 
north polar expedition in the ship " Jeannette," which sank 
N.E. of the New Siberia Islands in 1881. His intention was 
therefore to get his vessel fixed in the ice to the north of Eastern 
Siberia and let her drift with it. His plan was adversely criticized 
by many Arctic authorities, but it succeeded. The Norwegian 
parliament granted two-thirds of the expenses, and the rest was 
obtained by subscription from King Oscar and private indi- 
viduals. His ship, the " Fram " (i.e. " Forward ") ? was specially 
built of immense strength and peculiar form, being pointed at 
bow and stern and having sloping sides, so that the ice-floes, 
pressing together, should tend, not to crush, but merely to slip 
beneath and lift her. She sailed from Christiania on the 24th of 
June 1893. Otto Sverdrup was master; Sigurd Scott Hansen, 
a Norwegian naval lieutenant, was in charge of the astronomical 
and meteorological observations; Henrik Greve Blessing was 
doctor and botanist; and among the rest was Frederik Hjalmar 
Johansen, lieutenant in the Norwegian army, who shipped as 
fireman. On the 22nd of September the " Fram " was made 
fast to a floe in 78 50' N., 133 37' E.; shortly afterwards she 
was frozen in, and the long drift began. She bore the pressure 
of the ice perfectly. During the winter of 1894 -1895 it was 
decided that an expedition should be made northward over 
the ice on foot in the spring, and on the 14th of March 1895 
Nansen, being satisfied that the "Fram" would continue to 
drift safely, left her in 84 N., 101 55' E., and started northward 
accompanied by Johansen. On the 8th of April they turned 
back from 86° 14' N., the highest latitude then reached by man; 
and they shaped their course for Franz Josef Land. They 
suffered many hardships, including shortage of food, and were 
compelled to winter on Frederick Jackson Island (so named 
hy Nansen) in Franz Josef Land from the 26th of August 1895 
to the 19th of May 1896. They were uncertain as to the locality, 
but, after having reached 8o° N. on the south coast of the islands, 
they were travelling westward to reach Spitsbergen, when, on 
the 17th of June 1896, they fell in with Frederick Jackson and 



his party of the Jackson-Harmsworth expedition, and returned 
to Norway in his ship, the " Windward," reaching Vardo on the 
13th of August. A week later the " Fram " also reached Norway 
in safety. She had drifted north after Nansen had left her, 
to 85 57', and had ultimately returned by the west coast of 
Spitsbergen. An unprecedented welcome awaited Nansen. In 
England he gave the narrative of his journey at a great meeting 
in the Albert Hall, London, on the 8th of February 1897, 
and elsewhere. He received a special medal from the Royal 
Geographical Society, honorary degrees from the universities of 
Oxford and Cambridge, and a presentation of books (the " Chal- 
lenger " Reports) from the British government, and similar 
honours were paid him in other countries. The English version 
of the narrative of the expedition is entitled Farthest North 
(London, 1897), and the scientific results are given in The 
Norwegian North Polar Expedition 1893-1896; Scientific Results 
(London, &c., 1900 sqq.). 

In 1905, in connexion with the crisis between Norway and 
Sweden, which was folio wed by the separation of the kingdoms, 
Nansen for the first time actively intervened in politics. He 
issued a manifesto and many articles, in which he adopted an 
attitude briefly indicated by the last words of a short work 
published later in the year: "Any union in which the one 
people is restrained in exercising its freedom is and will remain 
a danger " (Norway and the Union with Sweden, London, 1005). 
On the establishment of the Norwegian monarchy Nansen was 
appointed minister to England (1906), and in the same year he 
was created G.C.V.O.; but in 1908 he retired from his post, 
and became professor of oceanography in Christiania university. 

NANSEN, HANS (1598-1667), Danish statesman, son of the 
burgher Evert Nansen, was born at Flensburg on the 28th of 
November 1598. He made several voyages to the White Sea 
and to places in northern Russia, and in 1621 entered the service 
of the Danish Icelandic Company, then in its prime. For 
many years the whole trade of Iceland, which he frequently 
visited, passed through his hands, and he soon became equally 
well known at Gliickstadt, then the chief emporium of the 
Iceland trade, and at Copenhagen. In February 1644, at the 
express desire of King Christian IV., the Copenhagen burgesses 
elected him burgomaster. During his northern voyages he had 
learnt Russian, and was employed as interpreter at court when- 
ever Muscovite embassies visited Copenhagen. His travels had 
begotten in him a love of geography, and he published in 1633 
a " Kosmografi," previously revised by the astronomer Longo- 
montanus. During the siege of Copenhagen by the Swedes in 
1658 he came prominently forward. At the meeting between the 
king and the citizens to arrange for the defence of the capital, 
Nansen urged the necessity of an obstinate defence. It was he 
who on this occasion obtained privileges for the burgesses of 
Copenhagen which placed them on a footing of equality with 
the nobility; and he was the life and soul of the garrison till 
the arrival of the Dutch fleet practically saved the city. These 
eighteen months of storm and stress established his influence 
in the capital once for all and at the same time knitted him 
closely to Frederick III., who recognized in Nansen a man 
after his own heart, and made the great burgomaster his chief 
instrument in carrying through the anti-aristocratic Revolution 
of 1660. Nansen used all the arts of the agitator with 
extraordinary energy and success. His greatest feat was the 
impassioned speech by which, on October 8th, he induced the 
burgesses to accede to the proposal of the magistracy of Copen- 
hagen to offer Frederick III. the realm of Denmark as a purely 
hereditary kingdom. How far Nansen was content with the 
result of the Revolution — absolute monarchy — it is impossible 
to say. It appears to be pretty certain that, at the beginning, 
he did not want absolutism. Whether he subsequently regarded 
the victory of the monarchy and its corollary, the admittance 
of the middle classes to all offices and dignities, as a satisfactory 
equivalent for his original demands; or whether he was so 
overcome by royal favour as to sacrifice cheerfully the political 
liberties of his country, can only be a matter for conjecture. 
After the Revolution Nansen continued in high honour, but

he chiefly occupied himself with commerce, and was less and less 
consulted in purely political matters. He died on the 12th of 
November 1667.

NANTERRE, a town of northern France, with a port on the 
Seine, in the department of Seine, at the foot of Mount Valerien, 
8 m. N.W. of Paris on the railway to St Germain. Pop. (1906), 
town, 11,874; commune, 17,434. The principal manufactures 
are chemicals, tallow and aluminium; stone quarried in the 
vicinity; the town is noted also for its cakes. The combined 
prison and mendicity depot for the department is a large 
institution, about 2 m. from the town. Nanterre (the ancient 
Nemptodurum or Nemetodurum) owes its origin to the shrine 
of Ste Genevieve (420-512), the patron-saint of Paris, whose 
name is still associated with various places in the town and 
district. The shrine is the object of a pilgrimage in September. 

NANTES, a city of western France, capital of the .department 
of Loire-Inferieure, on the right bank of the Loire, 35 m. above 
its mouth, at the junction of the Orleans, Western and State 
railways, 55 m. W.S.W. of Angers by rail. In population 
(town, 118,244; commune, 133,247, in 1906) Nantes is the first 
city of Brittany. The Loire here divides into several branches 
forming islands over portions of which the city has spread. 
It receives on the left hand the Sevre Nantaise, and on the right 
the Erdre, which forms the outlet of the canal between Nantes 
and Brest. The maritime port of Nantes is reached by way of 
the Loire and the ship canal between the island of Carnet and 
La Martiniere (9^ m.). Vessels drawing as much as 20 ft. 8 in., 
and at spring tides, 22 ft., can reach the port, which extends over 
a length of about i\ m. The outer port as far as the industrial 
suburb of Chantenay has a length of over half a mile. The 
principal quays extend along the right bank of the branch 
which flows past the town, and on the western shore of the island 
of Gloriette, Their total length used for trading purposes is 
5 m., and warehouses cover an area of 17 acres. A slipway 
facilitates the repairing of ships. The river port occupies the 
St Felix and Madeleine branches, and has quays extending for 
half a mile. Finally/ on the Erdre is a third port for inland 
navigation. The quays are bounded by railway lines along the 
right bank of the river, which the railway to St Nazaire follows. 
The older quarter of Nantes containing the more interesting 
buildings is situated to the east of the Erdre. 

The cathedral, begun in 1434 in the Gothic style, was unfinished 
till the 19th century when the transept and choir were added. 
There are two interesting monuments in the transept — on the 
right Michel Colomb's tomb of Francis II., duke of Brittany, and 
his second wife Marguerite de Foix (1507), and on the left that of 
General Juchault de Lamoriciere, a native of Nantes, by Paul 
Dubois (1879). Of the other churches the most interesting is 
St Nicolas, a modern building in the style of the 13th century, 
on the right bank of the Erdre. Between the cathedral and the 
Loire, from which it is separated only by the breadth of the quay, 
stands the castle of Nantes, founded in the 9th or 10th century. 
Rebuilt by Francis II. and the duchess Anne, it is flanked by 
huge towers and by a bastion erected by Philip Emmanuel 
duke of Mercceur in the time of the League. A fine facade in 
the Gothic style looks into the courtyard. From being the 
residence of the dukes of Brittany, the castle became a state 
prison in which Jean-Francois Paul de Gondi, Cardinal de Retz, 
Nicholas Fouquet, and Marie Louise of Naples, duchess of 
Berry, were'at different times confined; it is now occupied as the 
artillery headquarters. The chapel in which the marriage of 
Louis XII. with Anne of Brittany was celebrated was destroyed 
by an explosion in 1800. The Exchange (containing the tribunal 
and chamber of commerce), the Grand Theatre, the Prefecture 
and the town hall are buildings of the last half of the 18th or 
early 19th century; the law courts date from the middle of the 
19th century. Nantes has an archaeological collection in the 
Dobree Museum, and in the museum of fine arts a splendid 



collection of paintings, modern French masters being well 
represented; it also has a natural history museum, a large library 
rich in manuscripts and a botanical garden to the east. The 
Pommeraye Passage, which connects streets on different levels 
and is built in stages connected by staircases, dates from 1843. 
Between the Loire and the Erdre run the Cours St Pierre and 
the Cours St Andr6, adorned at the two ends of tlie line by 
statues of Anne of Brittany and Arthur III., Bertrand du 
Guesclin and Olivier de Clisson, and separated by the Place 
Louis XVI., with a statue of that monarch on a lofty column. 
The Place Royale, to the west of the Erdre, the great meeting- 
place of the principal thoroughfares of the city, contains a 
monumental fountain with allegorical statues of Nantes and the 
Loire and its affluents. A flight of steps at the west end of the 
town leads up from the quay to the colossal cast-iron statue of 
St Anne, whence a splendid view may be obtained over the 
valley of the Loire. Several old houses of the 15th and 16th 
centuries, the fish market and the Salorges (a vast granite 
building now used as a bonded warehouse) are of interest. 
Nantes has two great hospitals — St Jacques on the left bank of 
the Loire, and the Hotel-Dieu in Gloriette Island. It is the seat 
of a bishopric and a court of assizes, and headquarters of the* 
XL army corps; it has tribunals of first instance and of 
commerce, a board of trade-arhitrators, a chamber of commerce 
and a branch of the Bank of France. The educational institu- 
tions include lyc6es for both sexes, a training college for girls, 
schools of medicine and pharmacy and law, a preparatory school 
to higher instruction, science and letters, schools of music, art and 
navigation, technical and commercial schools, and a school for 
deaf-mutes and the blind. 

Among the more important industries of Nantes are sugar- 
refining, flour-milling, rice-husking, the manufacture of oil, 
soap, flour pastes and biscuits, and the preparation of tinned 
provisions (sardines, vegetables, &c); the manufacture of tin 
boxes, tiles, chemical manures, acid from chestnut bark, tobacco, 
leather, wood-pulp for paper, rope, boots and shoes, brushes 
and glass; saw-milling, shipbuilding, metal founding and the 
construction of engineering material; and wool and cotton- 
spinning and the manufacture of cotton and other fabrics, 
hosiery and knitted goods. Coal and patent fuel (chiefly from 
Great Britain) are the most important imports; next come 
phosphates and pyrites; other imports are timber and pulp- wood. 
The principal exports are bunker-coal (to French colonies), 
pyrites, slate, hoops and provisions. In the ten years 189&- 
1907 the average annual value of the imports was £2,657,000; 
of the exports £795,000. In 1907 there entered from foreign 
countries 738 vessels (209 British) with tonnage of 584,850, 
and cleared 778 with 154,720 tons of cargo, and 458,538 tons 
of hallast. Reckoning ships carrying cargo only the figures for 
the first and last years of the decade 1898-1907 were: 1898, 
ships entered, French 209 (tonnage 75,249), foreign 250 (tonnage 
154*936); ships cleared, French 173 (tonnage 32,591), foreign 
97 (tonnage 27,836): 1907, ships entered, French 186 (tonnage 
127,635), foreign 419 (tonnage 361,002); ships cleared, French 
126 (tonnage 81,299), foreign 128 (tonnage 45,181). 

Before the Roman occupation Nantes was the chief town of 
the Namnetes and consisted of Condovicnum, lying on the hills 
away from the river, and of Partus Namnetum, on the river. 
Under the Romans it became a great commercial and admini- 
strative centre, though its two parts did not coalesce till the 3rd 
or 4th century. In the middle of the 3rd century Christianity 
was introduced by St Clair. Clotaire I. got possession of the 
city in 560, and placed it under the government of St Fe*lix 
the bishop, who executed enormous works to cause the Loire 
to flow under the walls of the castle. After being several times 
subdued by Charlemagne, Brittany revolted under his successors, 
and Nominoe, proclaimed king in 842, ordered the fortifications 
of Nantes to be razed because it had sided with Charles the Bald. 
The Normans held the town from 843 to 936. About this time 
began the rivalry between Nantes and Rennes, whose counts 
disputed the sovereignty of Brittany. Pierre de Dreux, declared 
duke of Brittany by Philip Augustus, made Nantes his capital, 



NANTES, EDICT OF— NANTICOKE

surrounded it with fortifications and defended it valiantly 
against John of England. During the Breton wars of succession 
Nantes took part first with Jean de Montfort, but afterwards 
with Charles of Blois, and did not open its gates to Monfort 
till his success was assured and his English allies had retired. 
In 1560 Francis II. granted Nantes a communal constitution. 
In the course of the 15th and 16th centuries the city suffered 
from several epidemics. Averse to Protestantism, it joined the 
League along with the duke of Mercceur, governor of Brittany, 
who helped to raise the country into an independent duchy; 
and it was not till 1598 that it opened its gates to Henry IV., 
who here signed on the 2nd of May of that year the famous 
Edict of Nantes which until its revocation by Louis XIV. in 
1685 was the charter of Huguenot liberties in France. It was 
at Nantes that Henry de Talleyrand, count of Chalais, was 
punished in 1626 for plotting against Richelieu, that Fouquet 
was arrested in 1661, and that the Cellamare conspirators were 
executed under the regent Philip of Orleans. Having warmly 
embraced the cause of the Revolution in 1789, the city was in 
1793 treated with extreme rigour by J. B. Carrier, envoy of 
the Committee of Public Safety, whose noyades or wholesale 
drownings of prisoners became notorious. Nantes on more than 
one occasion vigorously resisted the Vendeans. It was here 
that the duchess of Berry was arrested in 1832 while trying to 
stir up La Vendee against Louis Philippe. 

NANTES, EDICT OF, the law promulgated in April 1598 by 
which the French king, Henry IV., gave religious liberty to his 
Protestant subjects, the Huguenots. The story of the struggle 
for the edict is part of the history of France, and during the 
thirty-five years of civil war which preceded its grant, many 
treaties and other arrangements had been made between the 
contending religious parties, but none of these had been satis- 
factory or lasting. The elation of the Protestants at the accession 
of Henry IV. in 1589 was followed by deep depression, when it 
was found that not only did he adopt the Roman Catholic faith, 
but that his efforts to redress their grievances were singularly 
ineffectual. In 1594 they took determined measures to protect 
themselves; in 1597, the war with Spain being practically over, 
long negotiations took place between the king and their repre- 
sentatives, prominent among whom was the historian J. A. de 
Thou, and at last the edict was drawn up. It consisted of 95 
general articles, which were signed by Henry at Nantes on the 
13th of April 1598, and of 56 particular ones, signed on the 
2nd of May. There was also some supplementary matter. 

The main provisions of the edict of Nantes may be briefly 
summarized under six heads: (1) It gave liberty of conscience 
to the Protestants throughout the whole of France. (2) It 
gave to the Protestants the right of holding public worship in 
those places where they had held it in the year 1576 and in the 
earlier part of 1577; also in places where this freedom had been 
granted by the edict of Poitiers (1577) and the treaties of Nerac 
( x 579) and of Felix (1580). The Protestants could also worship 
in two towns in each bailliage and s$n€chaus6e. The greater 
nobles could hold Protestant services in their houses; the 
lesser nobles could do the same, but only for gatherings of not 
more than thirty people. Regarding Paris, the Protestants 
could conduct worship within five leagues of the city; previously 
this prohibition had extended to a distance of ten leagues. 
(3) Full civil rights were granted to the Protestants. They could 
trade freely, inherit property and enter the universities, colleges 
and schools. All official positions were open to them. (4) To 
deal with disputes arising out of the edict a chamber was estab- 
lished in the parlement of Paris (le chatnbre de I'Sdil). This 
was to be composed of ten Roman Catholic, and of six Protestant 
members. Chambers for the same purpose, but consisting of 
Protestants and Roman Catholics in equal numbers, were estab- 
lished in connexion with the provincial parlements. (5) The 
Protestant pastors were to be paid by the state and to be freed 
from certain burdens, their position being made practically 
equal to that of the Roman Catholic clergy. (6) A hundred 
places of safety were given to the Protestants for eight years, 
the expenses of garrisoning them being undertaken by the king. 



In many ways the terms of the edict were very generous to 
the Protestants, but it must be remembered that the liberty 
to hold public worship was made the exception and not the rule; 
this was prohibited except in certain specified cases, and in this 
respect they were less favourably treated than they were under 
the arrangement made in 1576. 

The edict was greatly disliked by the Roman Catholic clergy 
and their friends, and a few changes were made to conciliate them. 
The parlement of Paris shared this dislike, and succeeded in 
reducing the number of Protestant members of the chatnbre 
de Vtdit from six to one. Then cajoled and threatened by Henry, 
the parlement registered the edict on the 25th of February 
1 599. After similar trouble it was also registered by the provincial 
parlements, the last to take this step being the parlement of 
Rouen, which delayed the registration until 1609. 

The strong political position secured to the French Protestants 
by the edict of Nantes was very objectionable, not only to the 
ardent Roman Catholics, but also to more moderate persons, 
and the payments made to their ministers by the state were 
viewed with increasing dislike. Thus about 1660 a strong move- 
ment began for its repeal, and this had great influence with the 
king. One after another proclamations and declarations were 
issued which deprived the Protestants of their rights under the 
edict; their position was rendered intolerable by a series of 
persecutions which culminated in the dragonnades, and at length 
on the 18th of October 1685 Louis revoked the edict, thus depriv- 
ing the Protestants in France of all civil and religious liberty. 
This gave a new impetus to the emigration of the Huguenots, 
which had been going on for some years, and England, Holland 
and Brandenburg received numbers of thrifty and industrious 
French families. 

The history of the French Protestants, to which the edict of Nantes 
belongs, is dealt with in the articles France : History.smd Huguenots.

NANTEUIL, ROBERT (1623-1678), French line-engraver, was 
born about 1623, or, as other authorities state, in 1630, the 
son of a merchant of Reims. Having received an excellent 
classical education, he studied engraving under his brother-in- 
law, Nicholas Regnesson; and, his crayon portraits having 
attracted attention, he was pensioned by Louis XIV. and 
appointed designer and engraver of the cabinet to that monarch. 
It was mainly due to his influence that the king granted the 
edict of 1660, dated from St Jean de Luz, by which engraving 
was pronounced free and distinct from the mechanical arts, and 
its practitioners were declared entitled to the privileges of other 
artists. He died at Paris in 1678. The plates of Nanteuil, 
several of them approaching the scale of life, number about three 
hundred. In his early practice he imitated the technique of 
his predecessors, working with straight lines, strengthened, but 
not crossed, in the shadows, in the style of Claude Mellan, and 
in other prints cross-hatching like Regnesson, or stippling in the 
manner of Jean Boulanger; but he gradually asserted his full 
individuality, modelling the faces of his portraits with the utmost 
precision and completeness, and employing various methods 
of touch for the draperies and other parts of his plates. Among 
the finest works of his fully developed period may be named 
the portraits of Pomponne de Bellicvre, Gilles Menage, Jean 
Loret, the due de la Meilleraye and the duchess de Nemours. 

A list of his works will be found in Dumesnirs Le Peintre-graveur

NANTICOKE, a borough of Luzerne county, Pennsylvania, 
U.S.A., on the North Branch of the Susquehanna river, opposite 
West Nanticoke, and 8 m. S.W. of Wilkes-Barre. Pop. (1880), 
3884; (1890), 10,044; C 1 *) 00 )* 12,116, of whom 5055 were 
foreign-born; (1910 census) 18,877. It is served by the 
Pennsylvania, the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western and the

NANTUCKET 



Central of New Jersey railways, and by an interurban electric 
line. Nanticoke is situated in the anthracite coal region, is 
surrounded by mines, and its industries consist chiefly in mining 
and shipping coal; it also has various manufactures, and in 
1905 the factory product was valued at $358,091. Nanticoke 
was laid out in 1793, and was incorporated as a borough in 1874. 
The name is that of an Algonquian tribe of Indians, conspicuous 
for their dark complexion, who originally lived in Maryland, 
were conquered by the Iroquois in 1678 and subsequently 
scattered; the main body removed to lands along the eastern 
branch of the Susquehanna, where some of them became merged 
with the Iroquois, and others removed to the Ohio and became 
merged with the Delaware. 

NANTUCKET, a county and township (coextensive) of Massa- 
chusetts, U.S.A. Its principal part is an island of the same 
name, 28 m. S. of Cape Cod peninsula; it also includes the 
island of Tuckernuck, which has an area of 1*97 sq. m., and is 
used for sheep grazing; Muskeget Island, which has excellent 
hunting, and of which about one-half is a public park; and the 
Gravel Islands and other islets. Pop. of the county (1905 
state census), 2930; (1910) 2962. 

The island, with a minimum length of 15 m., an average width 
of z\ m., and an area of about 47 sq. m., has a coast-line of 
88 m.; it lies within the 10-fathom line, but is separated from 
the mainland by Nantucket Sound, which is 25 to 30 m. across 
and has a maximum depth of 50 ft. The surface of Nantucket 
Island is open, nearly treeless, with a few hills, the highest being 
91 ft. above sea-level. The soil is sandy but affords good pasture 
in some places, and has been farmed with some success; the 
flora is rich, and includes some rare species. There are a score 
of fresh- water ponds, the largest being Hummock (320 acres). 
Copaum (21 acres) was, at the time of the first settlement, a bay 
and the commonly used harbour, but the present harbour (6 m. 
long) is that formed by Coatue Beach, a long narrow tongue of 
land on the N. side of the island. The northern part of Coatue 
Beach is known as Coskata Beach, and curves to the N.W.; 
near its tip is Great Point, where a lighthouse was first built in 
1784. There have been many terrible wrecks on the coast, 
and there are life-saving stations on Muskeget Island, near 
Maddaket, at Surfside and on Coskata Beach. At the W. end 
of the island is Tuckernuck Bank, a broad submarine platform, 
on whose edge are the island of Tuckernuck, on which is a village 
of the same name, and Muskeget Island. In the S.E. extremity 
of Nantucket Island is Siasconset (locally 'Sconset), a summer 
resort of some vogue; it has a Marconi wireless telegraph 
station, connecting with incoming steamers, the Nantucket 
shoals lightship and the mainland. On a bluff on the S. is the 
small village of Surfside. Other hamlets are Maddaket, at the 
\V. end of the island; and Polpis, Quidnet and Wauwinet (at 
the head of Nantucket harbour) in its E. part. 

The principal settlement and summer resort is the town of 
Nantucket (on the S.W. end of the harbour), which is served by 
steamers from New Bedford, Martha's Vineyard and Wood's 
Hole, and is connected with Siasconset by a primitive narrow- 
gauge railway. Here there are large summer hotels, old resi- 
dences built in the prosperous days of whaling, old lean-to houses, 
old graveyards and an octagonal towered windmill built in 1746. 
There are two libraries; one founded in 1836, and now a public 
library in the Atheneum building; and the other in what is 
now the School of Industrial and Manual Training (1904), founded 
in 1827 as a Lancasterian school by Admiral Sir Isaac Coffin 
(1 759-1839), whose ancestors were Nantucket people. The 
Jethro Coffin House was built in 1686, according to tradition; 
the Old North Vestry, the first Congregational meeting-house, 
built in 1711, was moved in 1767, and again in 1834 to its present 
site on Beacon Hill. The old South Church Tower, a steeple and 
clock tower, 144 ft. above sea-level, has a fine Portuguese bell, 
made in 18 10. Another old house, built in 1725, was the home 
of Elihu Coleman, an anti-slavery minister of the Society of 
Friends, who were very strong here until the close of the first 
quarter of the 19th century. Near the old Friends' School is 
the building of the Nantucket Historical Society, which has a 



collection of relics. Nantucket was the home of Benjamin 
Franklin's mother, Abiah, whose father, Peter Folger, was one 
of the earliest settlers (1663); of Maria Mitchell, and of Lucretia 
Mott. Adjoining the Maria Mitchell homestead is a memorial 
astronomical observatory and library, containing the collections 
of Miss Mitchell and of her brother, Professor Henry Mitchell 
(1830-1902), a distinguished hydrographer. The industries of 
the island are unimportant ; there is considerable cod and scallop 
fishing. Sheep-raising was once an important industry. Nan- 
tucket was long famous as a whaling port. As early as the 
beginning of the 18th century its fleets vied with those of eastern 
Long Island. In 1712 a Nantucket whaler, Christopher Hussey, 
blown out to sea, killed some sperm whales and thus introduced 
the sperm-oil industry and put an end to the period in which 
only drift- and shore- or boat-whaling had been carried on — 
the shore fishery died out about 1760. In 1757 whaling was the 
only livelihood of the people of Nantucket; and in 1750-1775, 
although whaling fleets were in repeated danger from French 
and Spanish privateers, the business, with the allied coopers 
and other trades, steadily increased. In 1775 the Nantucket 
fleet numbered 1 50, and the population was between 5000 and 
6000, about 90% being Quakers; but by 1785 the fleet had 
been shattered, 134 ships being destroyed or captured during 
the war. Tallow candles as a substitute for whale-oil had been 
introduced, and the British market was closed by a duty of 
£18 a ton on oil; a bounty offered by the Massachusetts legis- 
lature (£5 on white and £3 on yellow or brown spermaceti, 
and £2 on whale-oil per ton) was of slight assistance. During the 
war of 1 81 2 the Nantucket fleet was the only one active; it 
suffered severely during the war, and in the decade 1820-1830 
Nantucket lost its primacy to New Bedford, whose fleet in 1840 
was twice as large. Nantucket's last whaler sailed in 1869. 
Subsequently the island has been chiefly important as a summer 
resort. 

Title to Nantucket and the neighbouring islands was claimed 
under grants of. the Council for New England both by William 
Alexander, Lord Stirling, and by Sir Ferdinando Gorges. Lord 
Stirling's agent sold them in 1641 to Thomas Mayhew (1592- 
1682) of Watertown, Mass., and his son Thomas (c. 16 16- 
1657) for £40, and a little later the elder Mayhew obtained 
another deed for Martha's Vineyard from Gorges. In 1659 the 
elder Mayhew sold a joint interest in the greater part of the 
island of Nantucket for £30 and two beaver hats to nine partners; 
early in the following year the first ten admitted ten others as 
equal proprietors, and later, in order to encourage them to settle 
here, special half-grants were offered to tradesmen. The original 
twenty proprietors, however, endeavoured to exclude the trades- 
men from any voice in the government, and this caused strife. 
Both factions appealed to the governor of New York, that pro- 
vince haying claimed jurisdiction over the islands under the 
grant to the duke of York in 1664, and, becoming increasingly 
dissatisfied with that government, sought a union with Massa- 
chusetts until the islands were annexed to that province by its 
new charter of 1691. The town of Nantucket was settled in 
1661 and was incorporated in 1671. By order of Governor 
Francis Lovelace it was named Sherburne in 1673, but in 1795 
the present name was adopted. Its original site was Maddaket 
on the W. end of the island; in 1672 it was moved to its present 
site, then called Wescoc. When counties were first organized in 
New York, in 1683, Nantucket and the neighbouring islands 
were erected into Dukes county, but in 1695, after annexation 
to Massachusetts,' Nantucket Island, having been set apart from 
Dukes county, constituted Nantucket county, and in 17 13 
Tuckernuck Island was annexed to it.

NANTWICH— NAPHTHALENE 



167 



NANTWICH, a market town in the Crewe parliamentary 
division of Cheshire, England, 161 m. N.W. of London, on the 
London & North-Western and Great Western railways. Pop. 
of urban district (1001) 7722. It lies on the river Weaver, in the 
upper part of its flat, open valley. The church of St Mary and 
St Nicholas is a cruciform building in red sandstone, of the 
Decorated and Perpendicular periods, with a central octagonal 
tower. The fine old carved stalls are said to have belonged to 
Vale Royal Abbey, near Winsford in this county. Nantwich re- 
tains not a few old timbered houses of the 16th and 17th centuries, 
but the town as a whole is modern in appearance. The grammar 
school was founded in 1611. The salt industry, still the staple of 
several towns lower down the vale of the Weaver, was so 
important here in the time of Henry VIII. that there were three 
hundred salt-works. Though this industry has lapsed, there are 
brine baths, much used in cases of rheumatism, gout and general 
debility, and the former private mansion of Shrewbridge Hall is 
converted into a hotel with a spa. Nantwich has tanneries, a 
manufacture of boots and shoes, and clothing factories; and 
corn-milling and iron-founding are carried on. The town is one 
of the best hunting centres in the county, being within reach 
of several meets. 

From the traces of a Roman road between Nantwich and Middle- 
wich, and the various Roman remains that have been found in the 
neighbourhood, it has been conjectured that Nantwich was a salt- 
town in Roman times, but of this there is no conclusive evidence. 
The Domesday Survey contains a long account of the laws, customs 
and values of the salt-works at that period, which were by far the 
most profitable in Cheshire. The salt-houses were divided between 
the king, the earl of Chester and certain resident freemen of the 
neighbourhood. The name of the town appears variously as Wych 
Manbank, Wie Malban, Nantwich, Lache Mauban, Wysmanban, 
Wiens Malbanus, Namptewiche. About the year 1070 William 
Malbedeng or Malban k was created baron of Nantwich, which barony 
he held of the earl of Chester. In the 13th century the barony fell 
to three daughters and co-heiresses, and further subdivisions followed. 
This probably accounts for the lack of privileges belonging to Nant- 
wich as a corporate town. The only town charter is one of 1567- 
1568, in which Queen Elizabeth confirms an ancient orivilegeof 
the burgesses that they should not be upon assizesor juries with 
strangers, relating to matters outside the town. It is stated in the 
charter that the right to this privilege had been proved by an in- 

?[uisition taken in the 14th century, and had then already been held 
rom time immemorial. There was a gild merchant and also a town 
bailiff, but the latter office was of little real significance and was 
soon dropped. There is documentary evidence of a castle at Nant- 
wich in the 13th century. There is a weekly market on Saturday, 
held by prescription. In 1283 a three-days fair to be held at the 
feast of St Bartholomew was granted to Robert Burn el I, bishop of 
Bath and Wells (then holder of a share of the barony of Nantwich). 
This is the " Old Fair " or " Great Fair " now held on the 4th of 
September. Earl Cholmondeley received a grant of two fairs in 
1723. Fairs are now held on the first Thursday in April, June, 
September and December, and a cheese fair on the first Thursday in 
each month except January. The salt trade declined altogether in 
the 18th century, with the exception of one salt-works, which was 
kept open until 1856. There was a shoe trade in the town as early 
as the 17th century, and gloves were t made from the end of the 
16th century until about 1863. Weaving and stocking trades also 
flourished in the 18th century. The one corn-mill of Nantwich was 
converted into a cotton factory in 1789, but was closed in 1874. 
See James Hall, A History of Nantwich or Wick Milbank (1883). 

NAOROJI, DADABHAI (1825- ), Indian politician, was 
born at Nasik on the 4th of September 1825, the son of a Parsi 
priest. During a long and active life, he played many parts: 
professor of mathematics at the Elphinstone college (1854),; 
founder of the Rast Goftar newspaper; partner in a Parsi business 
firm in London (1855); prime minister of Baroda (1874); 
member of the Bombay legislative council (1885); M.P. for 
Central Finsbury (1892-1895), being the first Indian to be elected 
to the House of Commons; three times president of the Indian 
National Congress. Many of his numerous writings are collected 
in Poverty and Un-Briti$h Rule in India (1901). 

NAP, the pile on cloth, the surface of short fibres raised by 
special processes, differing with the various fabrics, and then 
smoothed and cut. Formerly the word was applied to the 
roughness on textiles before shearing. " Nap " in this sense 
appears in many Teutonic languages, cf. Ger. Noppe, Dutch nop, 
Nor. napp; the verbal form is noppen or nappen, to trim, cut 



short. The word nap also means a short sleep or doze (O. Eng. 
hnappian). In "napkin," a square of damask or other linen, 
used for wiping the hands and lips or for protecting the clothes 
at meals, the second part is a common English suffix, sometimes 
of diminutive force, and the first is from " nape," x Low Lat. 
napa or nappa, a corrupt form of mappa, table-cloth. Nape still 
survives in " napery," a name for household linen in general. 

NAPHTALI, in the Bible, the name of an Israelite tribe, the 
" son " of Jacob by Bilhah, Rachel's maid, and the uterine 
brother of Dan (Gen. xxx. 8). It lay to the south of Dan in the 
eastern half of upper Galilee (Josh. xix. 32-39), a fertile mountain- 
ous district (cf. Gen. xlix. 21; Deut. xxxiii. 23), open to the 
surrounding influences of Phoenicia and Aram. Apart from its 
share in the war against Sisera (Judg. iv. seq., see Deborah), 
little is known of it. It evidently suffered in the bloody conflicts 
of Damascus with Israel (1 Kings xv. 20), and was depopulated 
by Tiglath-Pileser IV. (2 Kings xv. 29; Isa. ix. 1). Naphtali and 
Dan are " brothers," perhaps partly on geographical grounds, 
but Dan also had a seat in the south (south-west of Ephraim), 
and the name of the " mother " Bilhah is apparently connected 
with Bilhan, an Edomite and also a Benjamite name (Gen. 
xxxvi. 27; 1 Chron. vii. 10). 

For the view connecting Naphtali (perhaps a geographical rather 
than a tribal term), or rather its Israelite inhabitants, with the south 
see the full discussion by H. W. Hogg, Ency. Bib. iii. col. 3332 sqq. 
with references. 

NAPHTHA, a word originally applied to the more fluid kinds of 
petroleum, issuing from the ground in the Baku district of 
Russia and in Persia. It is the va<j>Qa of Dioscorides, and the 
naphtha, or bitumen liquidum candidum of Pliny. By the alchemists 
the word was used principally to distinguish various highly 
volatile, mobile and inflammable liquids, such as the ethers, 
sulphuric ether and acetic ether having been known respectively 
as naphtha sulphurici and naphtha aceti. 

The tenn is now seldom used, either in commerce or in science, 
without a distinctive prefix, and we thus have the following: — 

1. Coal-tar Naphtha. — A volatile commercial product obtained by 
the distillation of coal-tar (see Coal-tar). * 

2. Shale Naphtha. — Obtained by distillation from the oil pro- 
duced by the destructive distillation of bituminous shale (see 
Paraffin). 

3. Petroleum NaphtJia. — A name sometimes given (e.g. in the 
United States) to a portion of the more volatile hydrocarbons 
distilled from petroleum (see Petroleum). 

4. Wood Naphtha. — Methyl alcohol (q.v.). 

5. Bone Naphtha. — Known also as bone oil or Dippel's oil. A 
volatile product of offensive odour obtained in the carbonization of 
bones for the manufacture of animal charcoal. 

6. Caoutchouc Naphtha. — A volatile product obtained by the 
destructive distillation of rubber. (B. R.) 

NAPHTHALENE, CioHg, a hydrocarbon discovered in the 
" carbolic " and " heavy oil " fractions of the coal-tar distillate 
(see Coal-tar) in 18 19 by A. Garden. It is a product of the 
action of heat on many organic compounds, being formed when 
the vapours of ether, camphor, acetic acid, ethylene, acetylene, 
&c, are passed through a red-hot tube (M. Berthelot, Jahresb., 
1851), or when petroleum is led through a red-hot tube packed 
with charcoal (A. Letny, Ber. t 1878, ri, p. 12 10). It may be 
synthesized by passing the vapour of phenyl btitylene bromide 
over heated soda lime (B. Aronheim, Ann., 1874, 171, p. 219); 
and by the action of ortho-xylylene bromide on sodium ethane 
tetracarboxylic ester, the resulting tetra-hydronaphthalene 
tctracarboxylic ester being hydrolysed and heated, when it 
yields hydronaphthalene dicarboxylic acid, the silver, salt of 
which decomposes on distillation into naphthalene and other 
products (A. v. Baeyer and W. H. Perkin, junr., Ber. t 1884, 
17, p. 451):—

NAPHTHOLS 



It is a colourless solid, which melts at 8o° C, and boils at 
2i8° C. It crystallizes in the monoclinic system; it is to be 
noted that a- and jS-naphthol assume almost identical forms, so 
that these three compounds have been called isomorphous. It is 
insoluble in water, but is readily soluble in alcohol, and ether. 
It has a characteristic smell, and is very volatile, distilling 
readily in a current of steam. It acts as a weak antiseptic. It is 
used for enriching coal gas, as a vermin killer, in the manufacture 
of certain azo dyes, and in the preparation of phthalic acid (q.v.). 
When passed through a red-hot tube packed with carbon it 
yields )3j3-dinaphthyl, (Ci H 7 )2. It forms a crystalline compound 
with picric acid. It readily forms addition products with 
chlorine and with hydrogen; the dichloride, Ci H 8 Cl2, is obtained 
as a yellow liquid by acting with hydrochloric acid and potassium 
chlorate; the solid tetrachloride, Cio H 8 CU, results when chlorine 
is passed into naphthalene dissolved in chloroform. Numerous 
hydrides are known; heated with red phosphorus and hydriodic 
acid the hydrocarbon yields mixtures of hydrides of composition 
C10H10 to C10H20. Sodium in boiling ethyl alcohol gives the 
a-dihydride, C10H10 (E. Bamberger, Ber., 1887, 20, p. 1705); 
and with boiling amyl alcohol the jS-tetrahydride, C10H12 
(E. Bamberger, Ber., 1890, 23, p. 1561). The a-tetrahydro- 
naphthalene is formed when naphthalene is heated with phos- 
phonium iodide at i7o°-ioo (A. v. Baeyer). Structurally 
naphthalene may be represented as a fusion of two benzene 
nuclei, the hydrogen atoms being numbered as in the inset

1-5 or 4-8 diderivatives are ana, whilst 1-8 or 4-5 are peri (see 
Chemistry, Organic). 

a- Nitro naphthalene, CioH 7 *N02, is formed by the direct nitration of 
naphthalene. For its commercial preparation see O. Witt, Die 
chemische Industrie, 1887, 10, p. 215. It crystallizes ^ in yellow 
needles, which melt at 61 ° C, and are readily soluble in alcohol. 
By the action of nitro-sulphuric acid it is converted into a mixture 
of 1*5 and i-8 dinitronaphthalenes (P. Friedlander, Ber. t 1899,32, 
P* 353 1 )- When heated with aniline and its salts it yields pnenyl- 
rosindulin (German patent 67339 U888)). $-Nitronaphthalene is 
prepared by acting with ethyl nitrite on an alcohol^ solution of 
t 2-nitro-a-naphthylamine in the presence of sulphuric acid (E. Lell- 
' mann and A. Remy, Ber., 1886, 19, p. 237), or with freshly prepared 
potassium cupronitrite on 0-naphthalene diazonium sulphate 
(A. Hantzsch, Ber., 1900, 33, p. 2553), It crystallizes in small 
yellow needles which melt at 78 C. and are volatile in steam. 

Sulphonic Acids. — Two monosul phonic acids (a and 0) result by 
acting with sulphuric acid on the hydrocarbon, the a-acid pre- 
dominating at low temperatures (8o° C. and under) and the 0-acid 
at higher temperatures (i7o°-200° C). They are crystalline, hygro- 
scopic compounds and are employed for the^ manufacture of the 
naphthols. Numerous di- and tri-su\ phonic acids are known. 

a- Naphthoquinone, Ci H 6 O 2 , resembles benzoquinone, and is formed 
by the oxidation of many a-derivatives of naphthalene with chromic 
acid. It crystallizes in yellow needles which melt at 125 C. It 
sublimes readily, is volatile in steam and reduces to 
the corresponding dihydroxy naphthalene. ^Naphtho- 
quinone is formed by oxidizing 2 -a mino-a- naphthol 
(from/9-naphthol-orangeby reduction) withferric chlo- 
ride. It crystallizes in red needles, which melt at 1 15 
C; it has no smell and is non-volatile (cf. phenan- 
threnequinone).-4/jzariwWacfe,CioH4(OH)202*NaHSOa, 
the sodium bisulphite compound of 7*8 dioxy-a- 
naphthoquinone, is a dyestuff used for printing on 
cotton in the presence of a chromium mordant. 
The naphthoquinone is prepared^ by the action 
of zinc and concentrated sulphuric acid on a-di- 
nitronaphthalene. A 2-6 naphthoquinone results 
on oxidizing 2*6 dihydroxy naphthalene with lead 
peroxide. 

a-Naphthoic acid, GoHj-CC^H, is formed by hydro- 
lysis of the nitrile, obtained by distilling potassium- 
a-naphthalene sulphonate with potassium cyanide (V. 
Merz, Zeit.f. Chemie, 1868, p. 34), or by heating the 
sulphonatewithsodiumformate (V.Meyer, ^nn.,1870, 
156, p. 274). It forms^ needles which melt at 160 C. 
^-Naphthoic acid, obtained by boiling 0-methylnaph- 
thalene with dilute nitric acid, or by hydrolysis of 
its nitrile (formed when formyl-0-naphthalide is 
heated' with zinc dust), crystallizes from alcohol in needles which 
melt at 184 C. 



NAPHTHOLS, or Hydroxynaphthalenes, G0H7OH, the 
naphthalene homologues of the phenols. The hydroxyl group 
is more reactive than in the phenols, the naphthols being con- 
verted into naphthylamines by the action of ammonia, and 
forming ethers and esters much more readily. 

a-Naphthol may be prepared by fusing sodium-a-naphthalene 
sulphonate with caustic soda; by heating a-naphthylamine 
sulphate with water to 200 C. (English Patent 14301 (1892)); 
and by heating phenyl isocrotonic acid (R. Fittig and H. 
Erdmann, Ann. 1885, 227, p. 242): C 6 H 6 CH:CH-CH 2 -C02H 
= Ci H7OH+H 2 O. It forms colourless needles which melt at 
94 C; and is readily soluble in alcohol, ether, chloroform, 
and caustic alkalis. It is volatile in steam. With ferric 
chloride it gives a dark-blue precipitate of a-dinaphthol, 
HO-CioHe-CioHe'OH. Alkaline potassium permanganate oxi- 
dizes it to phenyl-glyoxyl-ortho-carboxylic acid, HOzC-CeHvCO 
C0 2 H. It is reduced by sodium in boiling amyl alcohol solution 
to " aromatic " tetrahydro-a-naphthol (reduction occurring in 
the ring which does not contain the hydroxyl group). When 
heated with hydrazine hydrate at 160 C. it gives a-naphthyl 
hydrazine, CioH 7 NH-NH2(L. Hoffmann, Ber., 1898, 31, p. 2909). 
Nitric acid converts it into nitro-compounds, which are occasion- 
ally used for dyeing silk and wool. 

Martius yellow, CioH6(N0 2 )20Na*H 2 0, the sodium salt of 2-4 
dinitro-a-naphthol^ (for notation see Naphthalene), is prepared 
by the action of nitric acid on a-naphthol-2*4-disulphonic acid. It 
forms orange-yellow plates and dyes wool a golden yellow (from an 
acid bath). Naphthol yellow S., CioH^ONaHNC^SOsNa, prepared 
by the action of nitric acid on a-naphthol-2*47-trisulphonic acid, 
is an orange- yellow powder which dyes wool and silk yellow (from 
an acid bath). 

Numerous mono-, di- and trisulphonic acids of a-naphthol are 
employed in the preparation of azo dyes. The most important is 
Nevile^ and Winther's acid, CioH c (OH)(SO s H)(i*4), formed when 
diazotized naphthionic acid (a-naphthylamine-4-sulphonic acid) is 
boiled with dilute sulphuric acid (Nevile and Winther, Ber., 1880, 
*3» P- *949)» or when sodium naphthionate is heated with concen- 
trated caustic soda solution under pressure at 240°-26o° C. (German 
patent 46307 (1888)). It melts at 170 C, and is readily soluble in 
water. With ferric chloride it gives a blue coloration; 

p-Naphthol, C10H7OH, prepared by fusing sodium 0-naphtha- 
lene sulphonate with caustic soda, crystallizes in plates which 
melt at 122 C. With ferric chloride it gives a green colouration, 
and after a time a white flocculent precipitate of a dinaphthol. 
With sodium in boiling amyl alcohol solution it gives a mixture 
of alicyclic and aromatic tetrahydro-/3-naphthols (E. Bamberger, 
Ber. , 1890, 23, p. 197). When heated with ammonium formate 
to 150° C. it forms j3-naphthylamine. With nitrosodimethy- 
laniline hydrochloride it forms Meldola's Blue (dimethylamino- 
naphthophenoxazonium chloride), C18H15N2OCI (R. Meldola, 
Ber., 1879, 12, p. 2065).

a-naphthoquinone-oxime, formed by the action of nitrous acid on 
o-naphthol or .of hydroxylamine hydrochloride on o-naphthoquinone 
(H. Goldschmidt and H. Schmidt, Ber., 1884, 17 p. 2064); and 
2-mtroso-a-naphthol(fi-naphthoquinone-oxime), formed by the action 
of hydroxylamine hydrochloride on ^-naphthoquinone, 

NAPHTHYLAMINES, or Aminonaphthalenes, C10H7NH2, 
the naphthalene homologues of aniline, in contrast to which 
they may be prepared by heating the naphthols with ammonia- 
zinc chloride. 

a-Naphthylamine is prepared by reducing a-nitronaphthalene 
with iron and hydrochloric acid at about 70 C, the reaction 
mixture being neutralized with milk of lime, and the naphthy- 
lamine steam-distilled. It may also be prepared (in the form of 
its acetyl derivative) by heating a-naphthol with sodium acetate, 
ammonium chloride and acetic acid (A. Calm, Ber., 1882, 15, 
p. 616); by heating a-naphthol with calcium chloride-ammonia 
to 270 C; and by heating pyromucic acid, aniline, zinc chloride 
and lime to 300 C. (F. Canzonieri and V. Oliveri, Gazz., 1886, 16, 
P- 493)- It crystallizes in colourless needles which melt at 50° C. 
It possesses a disagreeable faecal odour, sublimes readily, and 
turns brown on exposure to air. Oxidizing agents (ferric 
chloride, &c.) give a blue precipitate with solutions of its salts. 
Chromic acid converts it into a-naphthoquinone. Sodium in boil- 
ing amyl alcohol reduces it to aromatic tetrahydro-a-naphthyl- 
amine, a substance having the properties of an aromatic amine, 
for it can be diazotized and does not possess an ammoniacal 
smell. Since it does not form an addition product with bromine, 
reduction must have taken place in one of the nuclei only, and 
on account of the aromatic character of the compound it must be 
in that nucleus which does not contain the amino group. This 
tetrahydro compound yields adipic acid, (CH 2 )4(C02H) 2 , when 
oxidized by potassium permanganate. The a-naphthylamine 
sulphonic acids are used for the preparation of azo dyes, these 
dyes possessing the important property of dyeing unmordanted 
cotton. The most important is naphtkionic acid, i-amino-4- 
sulphonic acid, produced by heating a-naphthylamine and 
sulphuric acid to 170-180 C. with about 3% of crystallized 
oxalic acid. It forms small needles, very sparingly soluble in 
water. With diazotized benzidine it gives Congo red. 

ft-Naphlhylamine is prepared by heating jS-naphthol with zinc 
chloride-ammonia to 200-210 (V. Merz and W. Weith, Ber., 
1880, 13, 1300); or in the form of its acetyl derivative by 
heating jS-naphthol with ammonium acetate to 270-280 C. 
It forms odourless, colourless plates which melt at m-112 C. 
It gives no colour with ferric chloride. When reduced by sodium 
in boiling amyl alcohol solution it forms alicyclic tetrahydro-)?- 
naphthylamine, which has most of the properties of the aliphatic 
amines; it is strongly alkaline in reaction, has an ammoniacal 
odour and cannot be diazotized. On oxidation it yields 
ortho-carboxy-hydrocinnamic acid, K^C^HrCHj-CHj-^H. 
Numerous sulphonic acids derived from jS-naphthylamine are 
known, the more important of which are the 2-8 or Badische, 
the 2*5 or Dahl, the 2-7 or 5, and the 2-6 or Bronner acid. Of 
these, the 5-acid and Bronner's acid are of more value technically, 
since they combine with ortho-tetrazoditolyl to produce fine red 
dye-stuffs. 

NAPIER, SIR CHARLES (1786-1860), British admiral, was 
the second son of Captain the Hon. Charles Napier, R.N., and 
grandson of Francis, fifth Lord Napier. He was born at 
Merchiston Hall, near Falkirk, on the 6th of March 1786. He 
became a midshipman in 1800, and was promoted lieutenant 
in 1805. He was appointed to the " Courageux " (74), and was 
present in her at the action in which the squadron under Sir J. B. 
Warren took the French " Marengo " (80) and " Belle Poule " 
(40) ,^ on the 13th of March 1806 in the West Indies. After re- 
turning home with Warren he went back to the West Indies in the 
" St George " and was appointed acting commander of the 
"Pultusk" brig. The rank was confirmed on the 30th of 
November 1807. In August 1808 he was moved into the " Re- 
cruit 'j (18), and in her fought an action with the " Diligent " 
(18), in which his thigh was broken. In April 1809 he took 
part in the capture of the " Hautpoult " (74), and was promoted 



acting post captain. His rank was confirmed, but he was put on 
half-pay, when he came home with a convoy. He spent some time 
at the university of Edinburgh, and then went to Portugal to 
visit his cousins in Wellington's army. In 18 n he served in 
the Mediterranean, and in 18 13 on the coast of America and in the 
expedition up the Potomac. The first years of his leisure, he 
spent in Italy and in Paris, but speculated so much in a steamboat 
enterprise that by 1827 he was quite ruined. In that year he was 
appointed to the " Galatea " (42), and was at the Azores when 
they were held by the count de Villa Flor for the queen of 
Portugal. He so much impressed the constitutional leaders that 
they begged him to take command of the fleet, which offer he 
accepted in February 1833. With it he destroyed the Miguelite 
fleet off Cape St Vincent on July 5, and on the demand of 
France was struck off the English navy list. Continuing his 
Portuguese services, he commanded theland forces on the success- 
ful defence of Lisbon in 1834, when he was made Grand Com- 
mander of the Tower and Sword, and Count Cape St Vincent in 
the peerage of Portugal. On his return to England he was re- 
stored to his former rank in the navy 1836, and received 
command of the " Powerful " (84), in 1838. When troubles 
broke out in Syria he was appointed second in command, and 
distinguished himself by leading the storming column at Sidon on 
September 26, 1840, and by other services, for which he was made 
a K.C.B. He went on half-pay in 184 1, and was in 1842 elected 
M.P. for Marylebone in the Liberal interest, but lost his seat in 
184(5. He was promoted rear-admiral the same year, and com- 
manded the Channel fleet from 1846 to 1848. On the outbreak of 
the Russian War he received the command of the fleet destined 
to act in the Baltic, and hoisted his flag in February 1854. 
He refused to attack Cronstadt, and a great outcry was raised 
against him for not obeying the orders of the Admiralty and 
attempting to storm the key of St Petersburg; but his inaction 
has been thoroughly justified by posterity. On his return in 
December 1854 he was not again offered a command. He was 
elected M.P. for Southwark in February 1855, and maintained 
his seat, though broken in health, until his death on the 6th of 
November i860. Sir Charles Napier was a man of undoubted 
energy and courage, but of no less eccentricity and vanity. 
He caused great offence to many of his brother officers by his 
behaviour to his superior, Admiral Stopford, in the Syrian War, 
and was embroiled all his life in quarrels with the Admiralty.

NAPIER, SIR CHARLES JAMES (1782-1853), British soldier 
and statesman, was born at Whitehall, London, in 1782, being 
the eldest son of Colonel George Napier (a younger son of the 
fifth lord Napier), and of his wife, the Lady Sarah Lennox 
who had charmed King George III. After the custom of those 
times Charles Napier had been gazetted an ensign in the 33rd 
regiment in 1794, and in 1797 his father secured for him the 
appointment of aide-de-camp to Sir James Duff, commanding 
the Limerick district. Longing for more active service, Napier 
obtained a commission as lieutenant in the 95th Manningham's 
Rifles (Rifle Brigade) in 1800. This newly formed corps was 
designed to supply a body of light troops for the English army 
fit to cope with the French voltigeurs.and tirailleurs, and was 
specially trained, at first under the eye of Colonel Coote Manning- 
ham, and then at Shorncliffe under the immediate supervision 
of -Sir John Moore. Moore speedily perceived the military 
qualities of the Napiers, and inspired the three brothers — 
Charles of the Rifles, George of the 52nd and William of the 
43rd — with an enthusiasm which lasted all their lives; but, 
though happy in his general, Charles Napier quarrelled bitterly 
with William Stewart, the lieutenant-colonel, and in 1803 left 
the regiment to accompany General H. E. Fox to Ireland as 
aide-de-camp. The great influence of his uncle x the duke 0*

NAPIER, SIR C. J. 



Richmond, and of his cousins, Charles James Fox and the general, 
procured him in 1804 a captaincy in the staff corps, and in the 
beginning of 1806 a majority in the Cape regiment. On his way 
to the Cape, however, he exchanged into the 50th regiment, 
with which he served in the short Danish campaign under Lord 
Cathcart in 1807. Shortly after his return from Denmark the 
50th was ordered to Portugal, and in command of it Napier 
shared all the glories of the famous retreat to Corunna. At the 
battle of Corunna, one of the last sights of Sir John Moore before 
he fell mortally wounded was the advance of his own old regiment 
under the command of Charles Napier and Edward Stanhope, 
and almost his last words were " Well done, my majors!" The 
50th suffered very severely and both the majors were left Tor dead 
upon the field. Napier's life was saved by a French drummer 
named Guibert, who brought him safely to the headquarters 
of Marshal Soult. Soult treated him with the greatest kindness, 
and he was allowed by Ney to return to England to his " old 
blind mother " instead of being interned. After about a year 
he heard that his exchange had been arranged, and, volunteering 
for the Peninsula, he joined the light division before Ciudad 
Rodrigo. As a volunteer he served in the actions on the Coa, 
and again at Busaco, where he was badly wounded in the face. 
He was ordered to England, but refused to go, and in March 181 1, 
though barely recovered, he hurried to the front to take part 
in the pursuit of Massena. After the battle of Fuentes d'Onor, 
he received the lieutenant-colonelcy of the 102nd regiment, 
which had become entirely demoralized at Botany Bay, and when 
he joined it at Guernsey in 181 1 was one of the worst regiments 
in the service. When he left it in 1813 it was one of the best. 
He accompanied it in June 181 2 from Guernsey to Bermuda, 
where he wrought a wonderful change in the spirit both of officers 
and men. By treating his men as friends he won their love and 
admiration, and became in a peculiar degree the hero of the 
British soldiers. After seeing further active service against the 
United States in September 1813 he exchanged back into the 
50th regiment, and in December 18 14, believing all chance of 
active service to be at an end, went on half-pay'. He was gazetted 
one of the first C.B.'s on the extension of the order of the Bath 
in 18 14, and was present as a volunteer at the capture of Cambray, 
but he just missed the great battle of Waterloo. Though an 
officer of some experience and more than thirty years of age, 
he now entered the military college at Farnham, and completed 
his military education. In 1810 he was appointed inspecting 
field officer at Corfu, in 1820 was sent on a mission to Ali Pasha 
at Iannina, and in 182 1 visited Greece, where he became an ardent 
supporter of the patriot party. From Corfu he was moved in 
1822 to Cephalonia, where he remained for eight years as governor 
and military resident. He was the model of an absolute colonial 
governor, and showed all the qualities of a benevolent despot. 
He made good roads and founded great institutions, but every- 
thing must be done by him, and he showed himself averse to 
interference, whether from the high commissioner of the Ionian 
Islands, whom it was his duty to obey, or from the feudal magnates 
of his own little colony, over whom it was his duty to exercise 
strict supervision. An interesting episode in his command was 
his communication with Lord Byron when he touched at 
Cephalonia on his way to take part in the Greek War of Inde- 
pendence. Byron sent a letter to the Greek committee in London 
recommending Napier's appointment as commander-in-chief. 
But after many negotiations the scheme came to nothing. 
In 1827 Napier, who had two years before been made a colonel 
in the army, quarrelled with Sir Frederick Adam, the new high 
commissioner, and in 1830, when Napier was in England on leave, 
Adam seized his papers and forbade him to return. Napier 
-thereupon, refusing promotion to the residency of Zante, retired 
in disgust, living for some years in the south of England and, 
after the death of his wife in 1833, in Normandy. Here he wrote 
his work on the colonies, and also an historical romance on 
'William the Conqueror. Another work, entitled Harold, has 
disappeared. In 1834 he refused the governorship of Australia, 
still hoping for military employment. In 1S37 he was promoted 
major-general with his brother George, in 1838 he returned to 



England and was made a K.C.B.; but he was to wait till 1839 
before he received an offer of employment. In that year he was 
made commanding officer in the northern district, and found his 
command no sinecure, owing to the turbulent state of the 
Chartists in the towns of Yorkshire, Lancashire and the Midlands. 
His behaviour during the tenure of his command is described 
by William Napier in his life of his brother, and his inability to 
hold a command which did not carry supreme authority is plainly 
portrayed. In this particular instance his sympathies were 
on the popular side, and, though he maintained law and order 
with the necessary rigour, he resigned as soon as the crisis had 
passed, and went to India. He was stationed at Poona, and 
in September 1842, when troubles were expected there, was 
ordered to Sind. 

His command in Sind from 1842 till August 1847 is the period 
of his life during which, according to his brother, he made good 
his title to fame, but his acts, more especially at first, have been 
most severely criticized. There can be little doubt that from 
the moment he landed in the province he determined to conquer 
the amirs, and to seek the first opportunity of doing so. He 
was to be accompanied by James Outram (y.tf.), who had been 
resident in Sind during the Afghan War, and who felt a great 
admiration for him, but who had also a warm affection for the 
amirs, and believed that he could put off the day of their destruc- 
tion. On the 15th of February 1843, Outram was treacherously 
assailed at Hyderabad, and on the 17th Napier attacked the 
Baluch army 30,000 strong with but 2800 men. With these 
2800 men, including the 22nd regiment, which would do anything 
for him, he succeeded in winning the brilliant and decisive 
victory of Meeanee, one of the most amazing in the history of 
the British army, in which generals had to fight like privates, 
and Sir Charles himself engaged in the fray. In the March 
following, after marching without transport in the most intense 
heat, he finally destroyed the army of the amirs at the battle 
of Hyderabad. His success was received with enthusiasm both 
by the governor-general, Lord Ellenborough, and by the English 
people, and he was at once made a G.C.B. Whether or not the 
conquest of Sind at that particular period can be justified, 
there can be no doubt that Charles Napier was the best adminis- 
trator who could be found for the province when conquered. 
Sind, when it came under English rule, was in a state of utter 
anarchy, for the Baluchis had formed a military government 
not unlike that of the Mamelukes in Egypt, which had been 
extremely tyrannical to the native population. This native 
population was particularly protected by Sir Charles Napier, 
who completed the work of the destruction of the Baluch 
supremacy which he had commenced with the victory of Meeanee. 
The labour of administration was rendered more difficult by the 
necessity of repressing the hill tribes, which had been encour- 
aged to acts of lawlessness by the licence which followed the 
Afghan War. The later years of his administration were made 
very stormy by the attacks on the policy of the conquest which 
had been made in England. He left Sind, after quarrelling with 
every authority of the presidency of Bombay, and nearly every 
authority of the whole of India, in August 1847, and received a 
perfect ovation on his return from all the hero- worshippers 
of the Napiers, of whom there were many in England. His short 
stay in England was occupied with incessant struggles with the 
directors of the East India Company; but the news of the 
indecisive victory of Chillianwalla created a panic in England, 
and the East India Company was obliged by puhlic opinion to 
summon the greatest general of the day to command its armies. 
Sir Charles started almost at a moment's notice, but on reaching 
India found that the victory of Gujrat had been won and the 
Sikh War was over. No taint of envy was in his nature, and he 
rejoiced that he had not had to supersede Lord Gough in the 
moment of defeat. His restless and imperious spirit was met 
by one equally imperious in the governor-general, Lord Dalhousie. 
The two men were good friends until, in the absence of Dalhousie 
at sea, Napier took upon himself to alter the regulations regarding 
the allowances to native troops; the occasion was urgent, as 
the troops were in a state of mutiny, but on his return Dalhousie 



NAPIER, JOHN 



171 



reprimanded the commander-in-chief and reversed his decision. 
Napier immediately handed in his resignation, and when the 
duke of Wellington supported Lord Dalhousie and repeated the 
reprimand he returned to England. He had been credited 
with foreseeing the Mutiny of 1857, and on the whole with 
justice. On one occasion he wrote that mutiny was " one of the 
greatest, if not the greatest, danger threatening India — a danger 
that may come unexpectedly, and if the first symptoms be not 
carefully treated, with a power to shake Leadenhall." On the 
mutiny of the 66th native regiment at Govindgarh he disbanded 
it, and handed its colours over to a Gurkha regiment, thus 
showing that he distrusted the high-class Brahman, and recognized 
the necessity of relying upon a more warlike and more disciplined 
race. His constitution was undermined by the Indian climate, 
especially by his fatiguing command in Sind, and on the 29th 
of August 1853 he died at Portsmouth. The bronze statue 
of him by G. G. Adams, which stands in Trafalgar Square, 
London, was erected by public subscription, by far the greater 
number of the subscribers being, as the inscription records, 
private soldiers.

NAPIER, JOHN (1550-1617), Scottish mathematician and 
inventor of logarithms, was born at Merchiston near Edinburgh 
in 1550, and was the eighth Napier of Merchiston. The first 
Napier of Merchiston, " Alexander Napare," acquired the 
Merchiston estate before the year 1438, from James I. of Scotland. 
He was provost of Edinburgh in r437, and was otherwise dis- 
tinguished. His eldest son Alexander, who succeeded him in 
1454, was provost of Edinburgh in 1455, 1457 and 1469; he 
was knighted and held various important court offices under 
successive monarchs; at the time of his death in 1473 he was 
master of the household to James III. His son, John Napier 
of Rusky, the third of Merchiston, belonged to the royal household 
in the lifetime of his father. He also was provost of Edinburgh 
at various times, and it is a remarkable instance of the esteem 
in which the lairds of Merchiston were held that three of them 
in immediate lineal succession repeatedly filled so important an 
office during perhaps the most memorable period in the history 
of the city. He married a great-granddaughter of Duncan, 
8th earl of Levenax (or Lennox), and besides this relationship 
by marriage the Napiers claimed a lineal male cadency from the 
ancient family of Levenax. His eldest son, Archibald Napier 
of Edinbellie, the fourth of Merchiston, belonged to the house- 
hold of James IV. He fought at Flodden and escaped with his 
life, but his eldest son Alexander, (fifth of Merchiston) was killed. 
Alexander's eldest son (Alexander, sixth of Merchiston) was born 
in 1513, and fell at the battle of Pinkie in 1547. His eldest son 
was Archibald, seventh of Merchiston, and the father of John 
Napier, the subject of this article. 

In 1549 Archibald Napier, at the early age of about fifteen, 



married Janet, daughter of Francis Bothwell, and in the following 
year John Napier was born. In the criminal court of Scotland, 
the earl of Argyll, hereditary justice-general of the kingdom, 
sometimes presided in person, but more frequently he delegated 
his functions; and it appears that in 1561 Archibald Napier 
was appointed one of the justice-deputes. In the register of 
the court, extending over 1563 and 1564, the justice-deputes 
named are " Archibald Naper of Merchistoune, Alexander 
Bannatyne, burgess of Edinburgh, James Stirling of Keir and 
Mr Thomas Craig." About 1565 he was knighted at the same 
time as James Stirling, his colleague, whose daughter John 
Napier subsequently married. In 1582 Sir Archibald was 
appointed master of the mint in Scotland, with the sole charge 
of superintending the mines and minerals within the realm, and 
this office he held till his death in 1608. His first wife died in 
1563, and in 1572 he married a cousin, Elizabeth Mowbray, 
by whom he had three sons, the eldest of whom was named 
Alexander. 1 

As already stated, John Napier was born in 1550, the year 
in which the Reformation in Scotland may be said to have 
commenced. In 1563, the year in which his mother died, he 
matriculated at St Salvator's College, St Andrews. He early 
became a Protestant champion, and the one extant anecdote 
of his youth occurs in his address " to the Godly and Christian 
reader " prefixed to his Plaine Discovery. He writes: — 

"In my tender yeares, and barneage in Sanct-Androis at the 
Schooles, having, on the one parte, contracted a loving familiaritie 
with a certaine Gentleman, &c. a Papist; And on the other part, 
being attentive to the sermons of that worthie man of God, Maister 
Christopher Goodman, teaching upon the Apocalyps, I was so mooved 
in admiration, against the blindnes of Papists, that could not most 
evidently see their seven hilled citie Rome, painted out there so 
lively by Saint John, as the mother of all spiritual whoredome, that 
not onely bursted I out in continual reasoning against my said 
familiar, but also from thenceforth, I determined with my selfe (by 
the assistance of Gods spirit) to employ my studie and diligence to 
search out the remanent mysteries of that holy Book: as to this 
houre (praised be the Lorde) I have bin doing at a I such times as 
conveniently I might have occasion." 

The names of nearly all Napier's classfellows can be traced 
as becoming determinants in 1566 and masters of arts in 1568; 
but his own name does not appear in the lists. The necessary 
inference is that his stay at the university was short, and that 
only the groundwork of his education was laid there. Although 
there is no direct evidence of the fact, there can be no doubt 
that he left St Andrews to complete his education abroad, and 
that he probably studied at the* university of Paris, and visited 
Italy and Germany. He did not, however, as has been supposed, 
spend the best years of his manhood abroad, for he was certainly 
at home in 1571, when the preliminaries of his marriage were 
arranged at Merchiston; and in 1572 he married Elizabeth, 
daughter of Sir James Stirling of Keir. About the end of the 
year 1579 his wife died, leaving him one son, Archibald (who in 
1627 was raised to the peerage by the title of Lord Napier), 
and one daughter, Jane. A few years afterwards he married 
again, his second wife being Agnes, daughter of Sir James 

1 The descent of the first Napier of Merchiston has been traced to 
" Johan le Naper del Counte de Dunbretan/' who was one of those 
who swore fealty^ to # Edward I. in 1296 and defended the castle of 
Stirling against him in 1304; but there is no authority for this genea- 
logy. The legend with regard to the origin of the name Napier was 
given by Sir Alexander Napier, eldest son of John Napier, in 1625, in 
these words: " One of the ancient earls of Lennox in Scotland had 
issue three sons: the eldest, that succeeded him to the earldom of 
Lennox; the second, whose name was Donald; and the third, named 
Gilchrist. The then king of Scotland having wars, did convocate his 
lieges to battle, amongst whom that was commanded was the earl of 
Lennox, who, keeping his eldest son at home, sent his two sons to 
serve for him with the forces that were under his command. . . . 
After the battle, as the manner is, every one drawing and setting 
forth his own acts, the king said unto them, ye have all done valiantly, 
but there is one amongst you who hath Na-Peer (i.e. no equal) ; 
and calling Donald into his presence commanded him, in regard to 
his worthy service, and in augmentation of his honour, to change 
his name from Lennox to Napier, and gave him the lands of Gosford, 
and lands in Fife, and made him his own servant, which discourse is 
confirmed by evidences of mine, wherein we are called Lennox alias 
Napier."

NAPIER, JOHN 



Chisholm of Cromlix, who survived him. By her he had five 
sons and five daughters. 

In 1588 he was chosen by the presbytery of Edinburgh one 
of its commissioners to the General Assembly. 

On the 17th of October 1593 a convention of delegates was 
held at Edinburgh at which a committee was appointed to follow 
the king and lay before him in a personal interview certain 
instructions relating to the punishment of the rebellious Popish 
earls and the safety of the church. This committee consisted of 
six members, two barons, two ministers and two burgesses — 
the two barons selected being John Napier of Merchiston and 
James Maxwell of Calderwood. The delegates found the king at 
Jedburgh, and the mission, which was a dangerous one, was 
successfully accomplished. Shortly afterwards another con- 
vention was held at Edinburgh, and it was resolved that the 
delegates sent to Jedburgh should again meet the king at Lin- 
lithgow and repeat their former instructions. This was done 
accordingly, the number of members of the committee being, 
however, doubled. These interviews took place in October 
1593, and on the 29th of the following January Napier wrote 
to the king the letter which forms the dedication of the Plaine 
Discovery, 

The full title of this first work of Napier's is given below. 1 
It was written in English instead of Latin in order that " hereby 
the simple of this Hand may be instructed "; and the author 
apologizes for the language and his own mode of expression in 
the following sentences: — 

11 Whatsoever therfore through hast, is here rudely and in base 
language set downe, I doubt not to be pardoned thereof by all 
good men, who, considering the necessitie of this time, will esteem 
it more meete to make hast to prevent the rising againe of Anti- 
christ ian darknes within this Hand, then to prolong the time in 
painting of language "; and " I graunt indeede, and am sure, that 
in the style of wordes and utterance of language, we shall greatlie 
differ, for therein I do judge my selfe inferiour to all men: so that 
scarcely in these high matters could I with long deliberation finde 
wordes to expresse my minde." 2 

Napier's Plaitie Discovery is a serious and laborious work, to 
which he had devoted years of care and thought. In one sense 
it may be said to stand to theological literature in Scotland in 
something of the same position as that occupied by the Canon 
Mirificus with respect to the scientific literature, for it is the first 
published original work relating to theological interpretation, 
and is quite without a predecessor in its own field. Napier lived 
in the very midst of fiercely contending religious factions; there 
was but little theological teaching of any kind, and the work 
related to what were then the leading political and religious 
questions of the day.

2 A Dutch translation was published at Middelburg in 1600 and a 
second edition in 1607. The work was translated into French by 
George Thomson, a naturalized Scotsman residing in La Rochelle, 
and published by him at that town in 1602, under the title Ouverture 
de tons les secrets de V Apocalypse. . . . Par Jean Napeir (c. a. d.) 
Nonpareil, Sieur de Merchiston, reveue par lui-mesme, et mise en 
Francois par Georges Thomson, Escossois. Subsequent editions were 

f)ublished in 1603, 1605 and 1607. German translations were pub- 
ished at Gerain 1611 and at Frankfort in 1605 and 1627. The 
second edition in English appeared at Edinburgh in 1611, and in the 
preface to it Napier states he intended to have published an edition 
in Latin soon after the original publication in 1593, but that, as the 
work had now been made public by the French and Dutch trans- 
lations, besides the English editions, and as he was " advertised 
that our papistical adversaries wer to write larglie against the said 
editions that are alreadie set out," he defers the Latin edition " till 
having first seene the adversaries objections, I may insert in the Latin 
edition an apologie of that which is rightly done, and an amends of 
whatsoever is amisse." No criticism on the work was published, 
and there was no Latin edition- A third edition appeared at Edin- 
burgh in 1645. Corresponding to the first two Edinburgh editions, 
copies were issued bearing the London imprint and dates 1594 and 
1611. 



After the publication of the Plaine Discovery », Napier seems to 
have occupied himself with the invention of secret instruments of 
war, for in the Bacon collection at Lambeth Palace there is a 
document, dated the 7th of June 1596 and signed by Napier, 
giving a list of his inventions for the defence of the country 
against the anticipated invasion by Philip of Spain. The docu- 
ment is entitled " Secrett Inventionis, proffitabill and necessary 
in theis dayes for defence of this Hand, and withstanding of 
strangers, enemies of God's truth and religion," 3 and the in- 
ventions consist of (1) a mirror for burning the enemies' ships 
at any distance, (2) a piece of artillery destroying everything 
round an arc of a circle, and (3) a round metal chariot, so con- 
structed that its occupants could move it rapidly and easily, 
while firing out through small holes in it. It has been asserted 
(by Sir Thomas Urquhart) that the piece of artillery was actually 
tried upon a plain in Scotland with complete success, a number 
of sheep and cattle being destroyed. % 

In 1 6 14 appeared the work which in the history of British 
science can be placed as second only to Newton's Principia. 
The full title is as follows: Mirifici Logaritkmorum Canonis 
description Ejusque usus, in utraque Trigonometria; ut eliam in 
omni Logistica Mathematical Amplissimi f Facillimi, & expeditis- 
sitni explication Authore ac Inventor e Ioanne Nepero, Bar one 
Merchistonii, &*c, Scoto. Edinburgh ex officind Andreae Hart 
Bibliopolae } CID.DC.XIV. This is printed on an ornamental 
title-page. The work is a small-sized quarto, containing fifty- 
seven pages of explanatory matter and ninety pages of tables. 

The nature of logarithms is explained by reference to the 
motion of points in a straight line, and the principle upon which 
they are based is that of the correspondence of a geometrical 
and an arithmetical series of numbers. The table gives the 
logarithms of sines for every minute to seven figures. This work 
contains the first announcement of logarithms to the world, the 
first table of logarithms and the first use of the name logarithm, 
which was invented by Napier. 

In 1617 Napier published his Rabdologia,* a duodecimo of one 
hundred and fifty-four pages; there is prefixed to it as preface 
a dedicatory epistle to the high chancellor of Scotland. The 
method which Napier terms " Rabdologia " consists in the use 
of certain numerating rods for the performance of multiplica- 
tions and divisions. These rods, which were commonly called 
" Napier's bones," will be described further on. The second 
method, which he calls the " Promptuarium Multiplicationis " on 
account of its being the most expeditious of all for the perform- 
ance of multiplications, involves the use of a number of lamellae 
or little plates of metal disposed in a box. In an appendix of 
forty-one pages he gives his third method, "local arithmetic," 
which is performed on a chess-board, and depends, in principle, 
on the expression of numbers in the scale of radix 2. In the 
Rabdologia he gives the chronological order of his inventions. 
He speaks of the canon of logarithms as " a me longo tempore 
elaboratum." The other three methods he devised for the sake 
of those who would prefer to work with natural numbers; and 
he mentions that the promptuary was his latest invention. In 
the preface to the appendix containing the local arithmetic 
he states that, while devoting all his leisure to the invention of 
these abbreviations of calculation, and to examining by what 
methods the toil of calculation might be removed, in addition 
to the logarithms, rabdologia and promptuary, he had hit upon 
a certain tabular arithmetic, whereby the more "troublesome 
operations of common arithmetic are performed on an abacus 
or chess-board, and which may be regarded as an amusement

Memoirs of John Napier (1834), p. 248.

rather than a labour, for, by means of it, addition, subtraction, 
multiplication, division and even the extraction of roots are 
accomplished simply by the motion of counters. He adds that 
he has appended it to the Rabdologia, in addition to the promp- 
tuary, because he did not wish to bury it in silence nor to publish 
so small a matter by itself. With respect to the calculating rods, 
he mentions in the dedication that they had already found so 
much favour as to be almost in common use, and even to have 
been carried to foreign countries; and that he has been advised 
to publish his little work relating to their mechanism and use, 
lest they should be put forth in some one else's name. 

John Napier died on the 4th of April 161 7, the same year 
as that in which the Rabdologia was published. His will, which 
is extant, was signed on the fourth day before his death. 
No particulars are known of his last illness, but it seems likely 
that death came upon him rather suddenly at last. In both the 
Canonis descriptio and the Rabdologia, however, he makes refer- 
ence to his ill-health. In the dedication of the former he refers 
to himself as " mini jam morbis pene confecto," and in the 
" Admonitio " at the end he speaks of his " infirma valetudo "; 
while in the latter he says he has been obliged to leave the 
calculation of the new canon of logarithms to others "ob in- 
firmam corporis nostri valetudinem." 

It has been usually supposed that John Napier was buried in 
St Giles's church, Edinburgh, which was certainly the burial- 
place of some of the family, but Mark Napier {Memoirs, p. 426) 
quotes Professor William Wallace, who, writing in 1832, gives 
strong reasons for believing that he was buried in the old church 
of St Cuthbert. 

Professor Wallace's words are — 

" My authority for this belief is unquestionable. It is a Treatise 
on Trigonometry, by a Scotsman, James Hume of Godscroft, 
Berwickshire, a place still in possession of the family of Hume. 
The work in question, which is rare, was printed at Paris, and has the 
date 1636 on the title-page, but the royal privilege which secured 
it to the author is dated in October 1635, and it may have been 
written several years earlier. In his treatise (page 116) Hume 
says, speaking of logarithms, ' L'inuenteur estoit un Seigneur 
de grande condition, et duquel la posterity est aujourd'huy en 
possession de grandes dignitez dans le royaume, qui estant sur 
fage, et grandement trauaille* des gouttesne pouvait faire autre 
chose que de s'adonner aux sciences, et principalment aux mathc- 
matiques et a la logistique, a quoy il se plaisoit infiniment, et auec 
estrange peine, a construict ses Tables des Logarymes, imprimees 
a Edinbourg en Tan 1614. ... II mourut Tan 1616, et fut enterre" 
hors la Porte Occidcntale d'Edinbourg, dans l'Eglise de Sainct 
Cudbert.' " 

There can be no doubt that Napier's devotion to mathematics 
was not due to old age and the gout, and that he died in 161 7 
and not in 1616; still these sentences were written within eighteen 
years of Napier's death, and their author seems to have had 
some special sources of information. Additional probability is 
given to Hume's assertion by the fact that Merchiston is situated 
in St Cuthbert's parish. It is nowhere else recorded that Napier 
suffered from the gout. It has been stated that Napier's mathe- 
matical pursuits led him to dissipate his means. This is not so, 
for his will {Memoirs, p. 427) shows that besides his large estates 
he left a considerable amount of personal property. 

The Canonis Descriptio on its publication in 1614, at once 
attracted the attention of Edward Wright, whose name is known 
in connexion with improvements in navigation, and Henry 
Briggs, then professor of geometry at Gresham College, London. 
The former translated the work into English, but he died in 
1 61 5, and the translation was published by his son Samuel 
Wright in 1616. Briggs was greatly excited by Napier's invention 
and visited him at Merchiston in 161 5, staying with him a whole 
month; he repeated his visit in 1616 and, as he states, " would 
have been glad to make him a third visit if it had pleased God 
to spare him so long." The logarithms introduced by Napier 
in the Descriptio are not the same as those now in common use, 
nor even the same as those now called Napierian or hyperbolic 
logarithms. The change from the original logarithms to common 
or decimal logarithms was made by both Napier and Briggs, 
and the first tables of decimal logarithms were calculated by 



173 

Briggs, who published a small table, extending to 1000, in 
1 61 7, and a large work, Arithmetica Logarithmica, 1 containing 
logarithms of numbers to 30,000 and from 90,000 to 100,000, in 
1624. (See Logarithm.) 

Napier's Descriptio of 1614 contains no explanation of the 
manner in which he had calculated his table. This account he 
kept back, as he himself states, in order to see from the reception 
met with by the Descriptio, whether it would be acceptable. 
Though written before the Descriptio it had not been prepared 
for press at the time of his death, but was published by his son 
Robert in 1619 under the title Mirifici Logarithmorum Canonis 
Construction In this treatise (which was written before Napier 
had invented the name logarithm) logarithms are called " arti- 
ficial numbers.'* 

The different editions of the Descriptio and Constructio, as well 
as the reception of logarithms on the continent of Europe, and 
especially by Kepler, whose admiration of the invention almost 
equalled that of Briggs, belong to the history of logarithms {q.v.). 
It may, however, be mentioned here that an English translation 
of the Constructio of 1619 was published by W. R. Macdonald 
at Edinburgh in 1889, and that there is appended to this edition 
a complete catalogue of all Napier's writings, and their various 
editions and translations, English and foreign, all the works 
being carefully collated, and references being added to the 
various public libraries in which they are to be found. 

Napier's priority in the publication of the logarithms is un- 
questioned and only one other contemporary mathematician 
seems to have conceived the idea on which they depend. There 
is no anticipation or hint to be found in previous writers, 3 and it 
is very remarkable that a discovery or invention which was to 
exert so important and far-reaching an influence on astronomy 
and every science involving calculation was the work of a single 
mind. 

The more one considers the condition of science at the time, 
and the state of the country in which the discovery took place, 
the more wonderful does the invention of logarithms appear. 
When algebra had advanced to the point where exponents were 
introduced, nothing would be more natural than that their utility 
as a means of performing multiplications and divisions should be 
remarked; but it is one of the surprises in the history of science 
that logarithms were invented as an arithmetical improvement 
years before their connexion with exponents was known. It is 
to be noticed also that the invention was not the result of any 
happy accident. Napier deliberately set himself to abbreviate 
multiplications and divisions — operations of so fundamental a 
character that it might well have been thought that they were 
in rerum naiura incapable of abbreviation; and he succeeded in 
devising, by the help of arithmetic and geometry alone, the one

great simplification of which they were susceptible — a simplifica- 
tion to which nothing essential has since been added. 

When Napier published the Canonis Descriptio England had 
taken no part in the advance of science, and there is no British 
author of the time except Napier whose name can be placed in 
the same rank as those of Copernicus, Tycho Brahe, Kepler, 
Galileo, or Stevinus. In England, Robert Recorde had indeed 
published his mathematical treatises, but they were of trifling 
importance and without influence on the history of science. 
Scotland had produced nothing, and was perhaps the last country 
in Europe from which a great mathematical discovery would 
have been expected. Napier lived, too, not only in a wild country, 
which was in a lawless and unsettled state during most of his 
life, but also in a credulous and superstitious age. Like Kepler 
and all his contemporaries he believed in astrology, and he 
certainly also had some faith in the power of magic, for there is 
extant a deed written in his own handwriting containing a con- 
tract between himself and Robert Logan of Restalrig, a turbulent 
baron of desperate character, by which Napier undertakes " to 
serche and sik out, and be al craft and ingyne that he dow, to 
tempt, trye, and find out " some buried treasure supposed to be 
hidden in Logan's fortress at Fastcastle, in consideration of 
receiving one-third part of the treasure found by his aid. Of 
this singular contract, which is signed, " Robert Logane of 
Restalrige" and " Jhone Neper, Fear of Merchiston," and is 
dated July 1594, a facsimile is given in Mark Napier's Memoirs. 
As the deed was not destroyed, but is in existence now, it is to 
be presumed that the terms of it were not fulfilled; but the fact 
that such a contract should have been drawn up by Napier 
himself affords a singular illustration of the state of society and 
the kind of events in the midst of which logarithms had their 
birth. Considering the time in which he lived, Napier is singu- 
larly free from superstition: his Plaine Discovery relates to a 
method of interpretation which belongs to a later age; he shows 
no trace of the extravagances which occur everywhere in the 
works of Kepler; and none of his writings contain allusions to 
astrology or magic. 

After Napier's death his manuscripts and notes came into the 
possession of his second son by his second marriage, Robert, who 
edited the Construction and Colonel Milliken Napier, Robert's lineal 
male representative, was still in the possession of many of these 
private papers at the close of the 18th century. On one occasion 
when Colonel Napier was called from home on foreign service, these 
papers, together with a portrait of John JNapier and a Bible with his 
autograph, were deposited for safety in a room of the house at Milli- 
ken, in Renfrewshire. During the owner's absence the house was 
burned to the ground, and all the papers and relics were destroyed. 
The manuscriptshad not been arranged or examined, so that the 
extent of the loss is unknown. Fortunately, however, Robert Napier 
had transcribed his father's manuscript De Arte Logistica, and the 
copy escaped the fate of the originals in the manner explained in the 
following note, written in the volume containing them by Francis, 
seventh Lord Napier: "John Napier of Merchiston, inventor of 
the logarithms, left his manuscripts to his son Robert, who appears 
to have caused the following pages to have been written out fair 
from his father's notes, for Mr Brings, professor of geometry at 
Oxford. They were given to Francis, the fifth Lord Napier, by 
William Napier of Culcreugh, Esq., heir-male of the above-named 
Robert. Finding them in a neglected state, amongst my family 
papery, I have bound them together, in order to preserve them 
entire. — Napier, 7th March 1801." 

An accountof the contents of these manuscripts was given by 
Mark Napier in the appendix to his Memoirs of John _ Napier, and 
the manuscripts themselves were edited in their entirety by him 
in 1839 under the title De Arte Logistica Joannis Naperi Mer- 
chistonii Baronis Libri qui supersunL Itnpressum Edinburgi 
m.dccc.xxx.ix., as one of the publications of the Bannatyne Club. 
The treatise occupies one hundred and sixty-two pages, and there 
is an introduction by Mark Napier of ninety-four pages. The 
Arithmetic consists of three books, entitled — (1) De Computationibus 
Quantitatum omnibus Logisticae speciebus communium; (2) De 
Logistica Arithmetica; (3) De Logistica Geometrica. At the end 
of this book occurs the note — " 1 could find no more of this geo- 
metricall pairt amongst all his fragments." The Algebra Joannis 
Naperi Merckistonii Baronis consists of two books: (1) " De nomi- 
nata Algebrae parte; (2) De positiva sive cossica Algcbrae parte," 
and concludes with the words, " There is no more of his algebra 
orderiie sett doun." The transcripts are entirely in the handwriting 
of Robert Napier himself, and the two notes that have been quoted 
prove that they were made from Napier's own papers. The title, 



which is written on the first leaf, and is also in Robert Napier's 
writing, runs thus : " The Baron of Merchiston his booke of Arith- 
meticke and Algebra. For Mr Henrie Briggs, Professor of Geometrie 
at Oxforde." 

These treatises were probably composed before Napier had 
invented the logarithms or any of the apparatuses described in the 
Rabdologia; for they contain no allusion to the principle of loga- 
rithms, even where we should expect to find such a reference, and 
the one solitary sentence where the Rabdologia is mentioned (" sive 
omnium facillime per ossa Rhabdologiae nostrae ") was probably 
added afterwards. It is worth while to notice that this reference 
occurs in a chapter " De Multiplications et Partitions compendiis 
miscellaneis," which, supposing the treatise to have been written in 
Napier's younger days, may have been his earliest production on a 
subject over which his subsequent labours were to exert so enormous 
an influence. 

Napier uses abundantes and defectivae for positive and negative, 
defining them as meaning greater or less than nothing (" Abun- 
dantes sunt quantitatcs majores nihilo: defectivae sunt quantitates 
minores nihilo "). The same definitions occur also in the Canonis 
Descriptio (1614), p. 5: " Logarithmos sinuum, qui semper majores 
nihilo sunt, abundantes vocamus, et hoc signo -f, aut nullo praeno- 
tamus. Logarithmos autem minores nihilo defectivos vocamus, 
praenotantes eis hoc si^num -." Napier may thus have been the 
first to use the expression " quantity less than nothing." He uses 
" radicatum " for power (for root, power, exponent, his words are 
radix, radicatum, index). 

Apart from the interest attaching to these manuscripts as the 
work of Napier, they possess an independent value as affording 
evidence of the exact state of his algebraical knowledge at the time 
when logarithms were invented. There is nothing to show whether 
the transcripts were sent to Briggs as intended and returned by him, 
or whether they were not sent to him. Among the Merchiston 
papers is a thin quarto volume in Robert Napier's writing contain- 
ing a digest of the principles of alchemy; it is addressed to his son, 
and on the first leaf there are directions that it is to remain in his 
charter-chest and be kept secret except from a few. This treatise 
and the transcripts seem to be the only manuscripts which have 
escaped destruction. 

The principle of " Napier's bones " may be easily explained by 
imagining ten rectangular slips of cardboard, each divided into 
nine squares. In the top squares of the 
slips the ten digits are written, and each 
slip contains in its nine squares the first 
nine multiples of the digit which appears 
in the top square. With the exception of 
the top squares, every square is divided 
into two^ parts by a diagonal, the units 
being written on one side and the tens on 
the other, so that when a multiple consists 
of two figures they are separated by the 
diagonal. Fig. 1 shows the slips corre- 
sponding to the numbers 2, o, 8, 5 placed 
side by side in contact with one another, 
and next to them is placed another slip 
containing, in squares without diagonals, 
the first nine digits. The slips thus placed 
in contact give the multiples of the number 
2085, the digits in each parallelogram being 
added together; for example, correspond- 
ing to the number 6 on the right-hand slip, 
we have o, 8+3, 0+4, 2, 1 ; whence we find 
o, 1, 5, 2, 1 as the digits, written backwards, 
of 6X2085. The use of the slips for the purpose of multiplication is 
now evident; thus to multiply 2085 by 736 we take out in this 
manner the multiples corresponding to 6, 3, 7, and set down the digits 
as they are obtained, from right to left, shifting them back one place 
and adding up the columns as in ordinary multiplication, viz. the 
figures as written down are — 

12510 
6255 
14595 

i53456o 
Napier's rods or bones consist of ten oblong pieces of wood or 
other material with square ends. Each of the four faces of each rod 
contains multiples of one of the nine digits, and is similar to one of 
the slips just described, the first rod containing the multiples of 
o, 1,9, 8, the second of o, 2, 9, 7, the third of o, 3, 9, 6, the fourth 
of o, 4, 9, 5, the fifth of 1, 2, 8, 7, the sixth of 1,3, 8, 6, the seventh 
of 1,4, 8, 5, the eighth of 2, 3, 7, 6, the ninth of 2, 4, 7, 5, and the 
tenth of 3, 4, 6, 5. Each rod therefore contains on two of its faces 
multiples of digits which are complementary tO a those on the other 
two faces; and the multiples of a digit and of its complement are 
reversed in position. The arrangement of the numbers on the rods 
will be evident from fig. 2, which represents the four faces of the 
fifth rod. The set of ten rods is thus equivalent to four sets of slips 
as described above, and by their means we may multiply every 
number less than 11,111, and also any number (consisting of course 




Fig. 1. 



NAPIER, SIR W. F. P. 






of not more than ten digits) which can be formed by the top digits 
of the bars when placed side by side. Of course two sets of rods 
may be used, and by their means we may multiply every number 
less than iii,iii,in and so on. It will be noticed that the rods 
only give the multiples of the number which is to be multiplied, or 
of the divisor, when they are used for division, and it is evident that 
they would be of little use to any one who 
knew the multiplication table as far as 9X9. 
In multiplications or divisions of any length it 
is generally convenient to begin by forming a. 
table of the first nine multiples of the multi- 
plicand or divisor, and Napier's bones at best 
merely provide such a table, and in an incom- 
plete form, for the additions of the two figures 
in the same parallelogram have to be performed 
each time the rods are used : The Rdbdologia 
attracted more general attention than the loga- 
rithms, and as has been mentioned, there were 
several editions on the Continent. Nothing shows 
more clearly the rude state of arithmetical know- 
ledge at the beginning of the 17th century than 
the universal satisfaction with which Napier's 
invention was welcomed by all classes and re- 
■ garded as a real aid to calculation. Napier also 
describes in the Rabdologia two other larger rods 
to facilitate the extraction of square and cube 
roots. In the Rabdologia the rods are called 
" virgulae," but in the passage quoted above 
from the manuscript on arithmetic they are referred to as 
" bones " (ossa). 

Besides the logarithms and the calculating rods or bones, Napier's 
name is attached to certain rules and formulae in spherical trigono- 
metry. " Napier's rules of circular parts," which include the com- 
plete system of formulae for the solution of right-angled triangles, 
may be enunciated as follows. Leaving the right angle out of 
consideration, the sides including the right angle, the complement of 
the hypotenuse, and the complements of the other angles are called 
the circular parts of the triangle. Thus there are five circular parts, 
a, by 90 ° — A, 90 ° — c, 90 — B, and these are supposed to be arranged 
in this order {i.e. the order in which they occur in the triangle) 
round a circle. Selecting any part and calling it the middle part, 
the two parts next it are called the adjacent parts and the remaining 
two parts the opposite parts. The rules then are^- 

sine of the middle part = product of tangents of adjacent parts 
= product of cosines of opposite parts. 

These rules were published in the Canonis Descriptio (1614), and 
Napier has there given a figure, and indicated a method, by means 
of which they may be proved directly. The rules are curious and 
interesting, but of very doubtful utility, as the formulae are best 
remembered by the practical calculator in their unconnected form. 

'* Napier's analogies " are the four formulae — 



Fig. 2. 



tani(a+»- ^{^gj tanic, 



^^-w-^ri!*"^ 



They were first published after his death in the Construct™ among 
the formulae in spherical trigonometry, which were the results of 
his latest work. Robert Napier says that these results would have 
been reduced to order and demonstrated consecutively but for 
his father's death. Only one of the four analogies is actually 
given by Napier, the other three being added by Briggs in the 
remarks which are appended to Napier's results. The work left 
by Napier is, however, rough and unfinished, and it is uncertain 
whether he knew of the other formulae or not. They are, however, 
so simply deducible from the results he has given that all the four 
analogies may be properly called by t his name. An analysis of the 
formulae contained in the Descriptio and Constructio is given by 
Delambre in vol. i. of his Histoire de V Astronomic moderne. 

To Napier seems to be due the first use of the decimal point in 
arithmetic. Decimal fractions were first introduced by Stevinus in 
his tract La Disnte, published in 1585, but he used cumbrous ex- 
ponents (numbers enclosed in circles) to distinguish the different 
denominations, primes, seconds, thirds, &c. Thus, for example, he 
would have written 123-456 as j 23(0)4(1)5(2)6(3). I fl the Rab- 
dologia Napier gives an " Admonitio pro Decimali Arithmetica," in 
which he commends the fractions of Stevinus and gives an example 
of their use, the division of 861094 by 432. The quotient is written 
} 993. 2 73 in the work, and 1 993, 2 '7*3 in the text. This single 
instance of the use of the decimal point in the midst of an arith- 
metical process, if it stood alone, would not suffice to establish a 
claim for its introduction, as the real introducer of the decimal 
point is the person who first saw that a point or line as separator 
was all that was required to distinguish between the integers and 
fractions, and used it as a permanent notation and not merely in the 
course of performing an arithmetical operation. The decimal point 
is t> however, used systematically in the Constructio (1619), there 
being perhaps two hundred decimal points altogether in the book. 



i75 

The c^/cnal point is defined on p. 6 of the Constructio in the 
words: *if uJyms periodo sic in se distinctis, quicquid post 
periodum notatur f radio est, cujus denominator est unitas cum tot 
cyphris post se, quot sunt figurae post periodum. Ut 10000000-04 
valet idem, quod iooooooo T fo. Item 25-803, idem quod 25tVVV 
Item 9909998-0005021, idem valet quod 0999998 ^MHot. & sic de 
caetens. ' On p. C 10-502 is multiplied by 3*216, and the result 
found to be 33-774432 ; and on pp. 23 and 24 occur decimals not 
attached to integers, viz. -4999712 and -0004950. These examples 
show that Napier was in possession of all the conventions and attri- 
butes that enable the decimal point to complete so symmetrically 
our system of notation, viz. (1) he saw that a point or separatrix was 
quite enough to separate integers from decimals, and that no signs 
to indicate primes, seconds, &c, were required; (2) he used ciphers 
after the decimal point and preceding the first significant figure; 
an d (3) he had no objection to a decimal standing by itself without 
any integer. Napier thus had complete command over decimal 
fractions and the use of the decimal point. Briggs also used deci- 
mals, but in a form not quite so convenient as Napier. Thus he 
prints 63-0957379 as 63 0957379, viz. he prints a bar under the 
decimals; this notation first appears without any explanation in 
his " Lucubrationes " appended to the Constructio. Briggs seems 
to have used the notation all his life, but in writing it, as appears 
from manuscripts of his, he added also a small vertical line just 
high enough to fix distinctly which two figures it was intended to 
separate: thus he might have written 6 3 095 7379. The vertical line 
was printed by Oughtred and some of Briggs's successors. It was a 
long time before decimal arithmetic came into general use, and all 
through the 17th century exponential marks were in common use. 
There seems but little doubt that Napier was the first to make use of 
a decimal separator, and it is curious that the separator which he 
used, the point, should be that which has been ultimately adopted, 
and after a long period of partial disuse. 

The hereditary office of king's poulterer (Pultrie Regis) was for 
many generations in the family of Merchiston, and descended to 
John Napier. The office, Mark Napier states, is repeatedly men- 
tioned in the family charters as appertaining to the " pultre landis " 
near the village of Dene in the shire of Linlithgow. The duties 
were to be performed by the possessor or his deputy; and the king 
was entitled to demand the yearly homage of a present of poultry 
from the feudal holder. The pultrelands and the office were sold 
by John Napier in 1610 for 1700 marks. With the exception of the 
pultrelands all the estates he inherited descended to his posterity. 

With regard to the spelling of the name, Mark Napier states 
that among the family papers there exist a great many documents 
signed by John Napier. His usual signature was " Jhone Neper," 
but in a letter written in 1608, and in all deeds signed after that date, 
he wrote " Jhone Nepair." His letter to the king prefixed to the 
Plaine Discovery is signed " John Napeir." His own children, who 
sign deeds along with him, use every mode except Napier, the form 
now adopted by the family, and which is comparatively modern. 
In Latin he always wrote his name " Neperus." The form " Neper " 
is the oldest, as John, third Napier of Merchiston, so spelt it in the 
15th century. 

Napier frequently signed his name " Jhone Neper, Fear of Mer- 
chisto~ " He was " Fear of Merchiston " because, more majorum, 
he had been invested with the fee of his paternal barony during the 
lifetime of his father, who retained the liferent. He has been some- 
times erroneously called l( Peer of Merchiston," and in the 1645 
edition of the Plaine Discovery he is so styled (see Mark Napier's 
Memoirs, pp. 9 and 173, and Libri qui supersunt, p. xciv.). 

The bibliographv of Napier's work attached to W. R. Macdonald's 
translation of the Canonis Constructio (1889) is complete and valuable. 
Napier's three mathematical works are reprinted by N. L. W. A. 
Gravelaar in Verhandelingen der Kon. Akad. van Wet te Amsterdam, 
1. sectie, deel 6 (1899). (J. W. L. G.) 

NAPIER, SIR WILLIAM FRANCIS PATRICK (1 785-1860), 
British soldier and military historian, third son of Colonel 
George Napier (1751-1804), and brother of Sir Charles James 
Napier (see above), was born at Celbridge, near Dublin, on the 
17th of December 1785. He became an ensign in the Royal 
Irish Artillery in 1800, but at once exchanged into the 62nd, and 
was put on half-pay in 1802. He was afterwards made a cornet 
in the Blues by the influence of his uncle the duke of Richmond, 
and for the first time did actual military duty in this regiment, 
but he soon fell in with Sir John Moore's suggestion that he should 
exchange into the 52nd, which was about to be trained in the 
famous camp of Shorncliffe. Through Sir John Moore he soon 
obtained a company in the 43rd, joined that regiment at Shorn- 
cliffe and became a great favourite with Moore. He served in 
Denmark, and was present at the engagement of Kioge, and, 
his regiment being shortly afterwards sent to Spain, he bore 
himself nobly through the retreat to Corunna, the hardships of 
which permanently impaired his health. In 1809 he became 



176 



NAPIER, SIR W. F. P. 



aide-de-camp to the duke of Richmond, lord, lieMofcant of 
Ireland, but joined the 43rd when that regiment was ordered 
again to Spain. With the light brigade (the 43rd, 52nd, and 95th), 
under the command of General Craufurd, he marched to Talavera 
in the famous forced march which he has described in his History, 
and had a violent attack of pleurisy on the way. He, however, 
refused to leave Spain, was wounded on the Coa, and shot near 
the spine at Cazal Nova. His conduct was so conspicuous during 
the pursuit of Massena after he left the lines of Torres Vedras 
that he as well as his brother George was recommended for a 
brevet majority. He became brigade major, was present at 
Fuentes d'Onor, but had so bad an attack of ague that he was 
obliged to return to England. In England he married Caroline 
Amelia Fox, daughter of General Henry Fox and niece of the 
statesman Fox. Three weeks after his marriage he again started 
for Spain, and was present at the storming of Badajoz, where 
his great friend Colonel M'Leod was killed. In the absence of the 
new lieutenant-colonel he took command of the 43rd regiment 
(he was now a substantive major) and commanded it at the 
battle of Salamanca. After a short stay at home he again 
joined his regiment at the Pyrenees, and did his greatest military 
service at the battle of the Nivelle, where, with instinctive 
military insight, he secured the most strongly fortified part of 
Soult's position, practically without orders. He served with his 
regiment at the battles of the Nive, where he received two wounds, 
Orthes, and Toulouse. For his services he was made brevet 
lieutenant-colonel, and one of the first C.B.'s. Like his brother 
Charles he then entered the military college at Farnham. He 
commanded his regiment in the invasion of France after Waterloo, 
and remained in France with the army of occupation until 1819, 
when he retired on half-pay. As it was impossible for him to 
live on a major's half-pay with a wife and family, he determined 
to become an artist, and took a house in Sloane Street, where he 
studied with George Jones, the academician. 

The years he had spent in France he had occupied in improving 
his general education, for, incredible as it seems, the author of the 
History of the War in the Peninsula could not spell or write 
respectable English till that time. But his career was to be great 
in literature, not in art. The tendency appeared in an able 
review of Jomini's works (Edinburgh Rev.) in 1821, and in 1823 
Mr Bickersteth (afterwards Lord Langdale) suggested to him 
the expediency of writing a history of the Peninsular War. For 
some time he did not take kindly to the suggestion, but at last 
determined to become an author in order to defend the memory 
of Sir John Moore, and to prevent the glory of his old chief being 
overshadowed by that of Wellington. The duke of Wellington 
himself gave him much assistance, and handed over to him the 
whole of Joseph Bonaparte's correspondence which had been 
taken at the battle of Vittoria; this was all in cipher, but Mrs 
Napier, witb great patience, discovered the keys. Marshal Soult 
also took an active interest in the work and arranged for the 
French translation of Mathieu Dumas. In 1828 the first volume 
of the History appeared. The publisher, John Murray, indeed, 
was disappointed in the sale of the first volume and Napier 
published the remainder himself. But it was at once seen that 
the great deeds of the Peninsular War were about to be fitly 
commemorated. The excitement which followed the appearance 
of each volume is proved by the innumerable pamphlets issued 
by those who believed themselves to be attacked, and by personal 
altercations with many distinguished officers. But the success 
of the book was proved still more by the absence of competition 
than by these bitter controversies. The histories of Sou they and 
Lord Londonderry fell still-born, and Sir George Murray, 
Wellington's quartermaster-general, who had determined to pro- 
duce the history, gave up the attempt in despair. This success was 
due to a combination of qualities which have justly secured for 
Napier the title of being the greatest military historian England 
has produced. When in 1840 the last volume of the History was 
published, his fame not only in England but in France and 
Germany was safely established. 

His life during these years had been chiefly absorbed in his 
History, but he had warmly sympathized with the movement 



for political reform which was agitating England. The Radicals 
of Bath and many other cities and towns pressed him to enter 
parliament, and Napier was actually invited to become the 
military chief of a national guard to obtain reforms by force of 
arms. He refused the dangerous honour on the ground that he 
was in bad health and had a family of eight children. In 1830 
he had been promoted colonel, and in 1842 he was made a major- 
general and given the lieutenant-governorship of Guernsey. 
Here he found plenty of occupation in controlling the relations 
between the soldiers and the inhabitants, and also in working 
out proposals for a complete scheme of reform in the government 
of the island. While he was at Guernsey his brother Charles 
had conquered Sind, and the attacks made on the policy of that 
conquest brought William Napier again into the field of literature. 
In 1845 he published his History of the Conquest ofScinde, and in 
1851 the corresponding History of the Administration ofScinde — 
books which in style and vigour rivalled the great History, but 
which, being written for controversial purposes, were not likely 
to maintain enduring popularity. In 1847 he resigned his 
governorship, and in 1848 was made a K.C.B., and settled at 
Scinde House, Clapham Park. In 1851 he was promoted lieu- 
tenant-general. His time was fully occupied in defending his 
brother, in revising the numerous editions of his History which 
were being called for, and in writing letters to The Times on every 
conceivable subject, whether military or literary. His energy 
is the more astonishing when it is remembered that he never 
recovered from the effects of the wound he had received at 
Cazal Nova, and that he often had to he on his back for months 
together. His domestic life was shadowed by the incurable 
affliction of his only son, and when his brother Charles died in 
1853 the world seemed to be darkening round him. He devoted 
himself to writing the life of that brother, which appeared in 
1857, and which is in many respects his most characteristic book. 
In the end of 1853 his younger brother, Captain Henry Napier, 
R.N., died, and in 1855 his brother Sir George (see below). 
Inspired by his work, he lived on till the year i860, when, broken 
by trouble, fatigue and ill-health, he died (February 12) at 
Clapham. Four months earlier he had been promoted to the 
full rank of general. 

Asa military historian Sir William Naoier is incomparably 
superior to any other English writer, and his true compeers are 
Thucydides, Caesar and Davila. All four had been soldiers in the 
wars they describe; all four possessed a peculiar insight into the 
mainsprings of action both in war and peace; and each possessed 
a peculiar and inimitable style. Napier always wrote as if he was 
burning with an inextinguishable desire to express what he was 
feeling, which gives his style a peculiar spontaneity, and yet he 
rewrote the first volume of his History no less than six times. His 
descriptions of sieges and of battles^ are admirable by themselves, 
and his analyses of the peculiarly intricate Spanish intrigues are 
even more remarkable, while the descriptions and analyses are 
both lit up with flashes of political wisdom and military insight. 
It is to be noted that he displays the spirit of the partisan, even 
when most impartial, and defends his opinions, even when most 
undoubtedly true, as if he were arguing some controverted question. 
If his style was modelled on anything, it was on Caesar's comment- 
aries, and a thorough knowledge o^ the writings of the Roman 
general will often explain allusions in Napier. The portraits of 
Sir John Moore and Colonel M'Leod, and the last paragraphs de- 
scriptive of the storming of Badajoz, may be taken as examples 
of his great natural eloquence. 

His brother, Sir George Thomas Napier (1784-1855), entered 
the army in 1800, and served with distinction under Moore and 
Wellington in the Peninsula — and lost his right arm at the 
storming of Badajoz. He became major-general in 1837, K.C.B. 
in 1838 and lieutenant-general in 1846. He was governor and 
commander-in-chief at the Cape from 1839 to 1843, during which 
time .the abolition of slavery and the expulsion of the Boers from 
Natal were the chief events. He was offered, but declined, the 
chief command in India after Chillianwalla, and also that of the 
Sardinian army in 1849. He became full general in 1854. He 
died at Geneva on the 16th of September 1855. His auto- 
biography, Passages in the Early Military Life of General Sir 
G. T. Napier, was published by his surviving son, General 
W. C. E. Napier (the author of an important work on outpost 
duty), in 1885.

The youngest brother, Henry Edward Napier (1780-1853),' 
served in the navy during the Napoleonic wars, retired as a 
captain, and wrote a learned Florentine History from the earliest 
authentic Records to the Accession of Ferdinand III. of Tuscany 
(1846-1847). 

For Sir William Napier's life, see his Life and Letters, edited by the 
Right Honourable H. A. Bruce (Lord Aberdare) (2 vols., 1862). 

NAPIER AND ETTRICK, FRANCIS NAPIER, Baron (1819- 
1898), British diplomatist, was descended from the ancient 
Scottish family of Napier of Merchistoun, his ancestor Sir 
Alexander Napier (d. c. 1473) being the elder son of Alexander 
Napier (d. c. 1454), provost of Edinburgh, who obtained lands 
at Merchistoun early in the 15th century. Sir Alexander was 
comptroller of the household of the king of Scotland, and was 
often sent to England and elsewhere on public business. Of 
his descendants one Napier of Merchistoun was killed at Sauchie- 
burn, another fell at Flodden and a third at Pinkie. The seventh 
Napier of Merchistoun was Sir Archibald Napier (1534-1608), 
master of the Scottish mint, and the eighth was John Napier 
(q.v.) the inventor of logarithms. John's eldest son, Sir Archibald 
Napier (c. 1576-1645), was treasurer-depute of Scotland from 
1622 to 1 63 1, and was created Lord Napier of Merchistoun in 
1627. He married Margaret Graham, sister of the great marquess 
of Montrose, whose cause he espoused, and he wrote some 
Memoirs which were published in Edinburgh in 1793. His son 
Archibald, the 2nd lord (162 5-1658), fought under Montrose at 
Auldearn, at Alford, at Kilsyth and at Philiphaugh, and was 
afterwards with his famous uncle on the continent of Europe. 
His son, Archibald, the 3rd lord (d. 1683), was succeeded by 
special arrangement in the title, first by his nephew, Thomas 
Nicolson (1660-1686), a son of his sister Jean and her husband 
Sir Thomas Nicolson, Bart. (d. 1670), and then by his sister 
Margaret (d. 1706), the widow of John Brisbane (d. 1684). The 
6th lord was Margaret's grandson Francis Scott (c. 1702- 17 73), a 
son of Sir William Scott, Bart., of Thirlestane (d. 1725). Francis 
Scott, who took the additional name of Napier, had' a large 
family, his sons including William, the 7th lord, and Colonel 
George Napier (1 751-1804). His famous grandsons are dealt 
with above. Another literary member of the family was Mark 
Napier (1 798-1879), called by Mr Andrew Lang " the impetuous 
biographer of Montrose," who wrote Memoirs of John Napier 
of Merchiston (1834), Montrose and the Covenanters (1838), 
Memoirs of Montrose (1856), Memorials of Graham of Claverhouse 
(1 850-1 86 2), and a valuable legal work, The Law of Prescription 
in Scotland (1839 and again 1854). William, 7th Lord Napier 
(1730-1775), was succeeded as 8th lord by his son Francis (1758- 
1823), who, after serving in the English army during the American 
War of Independence, was lord high commissioner to the general 
assembly of the Church of Scotland, and compiled a genealogical 
account of his family which is still in manuscript. His son 
William John, the 9th lord (1786-1834), who was present at the 
battle of Trafalgar, was the father of Francis Napier, Lord Napier 
and Ettrick. 

Born on the 15th of September 18 19 Francis entered the 
diplomatic service in 1840, and was employed in successive posts 
at Vienna, Constantinople, Naples, Washington and the Hague. 
During this time he earned the highest opinions both at home 
and abroad. In i860 he became ambassador at St Petersburg, 
and in 1864 at Berlin. In 1866 he was appointed governor of 
Madras, and was at once confronted with a serious famine in the 
northern districts. In dealing with this and other problems he 
showed great activity and practical sense, and he encouraged 
public works, particularly irrigation. In 1872 he acted for a few 
months as Viceroy, after Lord Mayo's assassination; and on 
Lord Northbrook's appointment to the office he returned to 
England, being created a baron of the United Kingdom (Baron 
Ettrick of Ettrick) for his services. He continued, both in 
England and in Scotland, to take great interest in social questions. 
He was for a time a member of the London School Board, and 
he was chairman of the Crofters' Commission in 1883, the result 
of which was the appointment of a permanent body to deal with 
questions affecting the Scottish crofters and cottars. He died at 



Florence. on the 19th of December 1898, leaving a widow and 
three sons, the eldest of whom, William John George (b. 1846), 
succeeded to his titles. 

NAPIER OF MAGDALA, ROBERT CORNELIS NAPIER, 
1ST Baron (1810-1890), British field-marshal, son of Major 
Charles Frederick Napier, who was wounded at the storming of 
Meester Cornclis (Aug. 26, i8ro) in Java and died some months 
later, was born at Colombo, Ceylon, on the 6th of December 
1810. He entered the Bengal Engineers from Addiscombe 
College in 1826, and after the usual course of instruction at 
Chatham, arrived in India in November 1828, For some years 
he was employed in the irrigation branch of the public works 
department, and in 1838 he laid out the new lull station at 
Darjeeling. Promoted captain in January 1841, he was ap- 
pointed to Sirhind, where he laid out cantonments on a new 
principle — known as the Napier system — for the troops returning 
from Afghanistan. In December 1845 he joined the army of 
the Sutlej, and commanded the Engineers at the battle of Mudki, 
where he had a horse shot under him. At the battle of Ferozeshah 
on the 31st December he again had his horse shot under him, and, 
joining the 31st Regiment on foot, was severely wounded in 
storming the entrenched Sikh camp. He was present at the 
battle of Sobraon on 10th February 1846, and in the advance to 
Lahore; was mentioned in despatches for his services in the 
campaign, and received a brevet majority. He was chief engineer 
at the reduction of Kote-Kangra by Brigadier-General Wheeler 
in May 1846, and received the thanks of government. He was 
then appointed consulting engineer to the Punjab resident and 
council of regency, but was again called to the field to direct the 
siege of Multan. He was wounded in the attack on the entrenched 
position in September 1848, but was present at the action of 
Shujabad, the capture of the suburbs, the successful storm of 
Multan on 23rd January 1849, and the surrender of the fort of 
Chiniot. He then joined Lord Gough, took part, as commanding 
engineer of the right wing, in the battle of Gujrat in February 
1849, accompanied Sir W. R. Gilbert in his pursuit of the Sikhs 
and Afghans, and was present at the passage of the Jhelum, the 
surrender of the Sikh army, and the surprise of Attock. For his 
services he was mentioned in despatches and received a brevet 
lieutenant-colonelcy. At the close of the war Napier was 
appointed civil engineer to the board of administration of the 
annexed Punjab province, and carried out many important 
public works during his tenure of office. In December 1852 he 
commanded a column in the first Hazara expedition, and in the 
following year against the Boris; and for his services in these 
campaigns was mentioned in despatches, received the special 
thanks of government and a brevet-colonelcy. He was 
appointed military secretary and adjutant-general to Sir James 
Outranks force for the relief of Lucknow in the Indian Mutiny 
in 1857, and was engaged in the actions which culminated in the 
first relief of Lucknow. He directed the defence of Lucknow until 
the second relief, when he was severely wounded in crossing a 
very exposed space with Outram and Havelock to meet Sir Colin 
Campbell, He was chief of the staff to Outram in the defence of 
the Alambagh position, and drew up the plan of operations for 
the attack of Lucknow, which was approved by Sir Colin Camp- 
bell and carried out by Napier, as brigadier-general commanding 
the Engineers, in March 1858. On the fall of Lucknow Napier 
was most favourably mentioned in despatches, and made C,B. 
He joined Sir Hugh Rose as second-in-command in his march on 
Gwalior, and commanded the 2nd brigade at the action of Morar 
on the 1 6th June, On the fall of Gwalior he was entrusted with 
the task of pursuing the enemy. With only 700 men he came up 
with Tantia Tppi and 1 2,000 men on the plains of Jaora Alipur, and 
completely defeated him, capturing all his guns (25), ammunition 
and baggage. On Sir Hugh Rose's departure he took command of 
the Gwalior division, captured Paori in August, routed Ferozeshah, 
a prince of the house of Delhi, at Ranode in December, and, 
in January 1859, succeeded in securing the surrender of Man 
Singh and Tantia Topi, which ended the war. For his services 
Napier received the thanks of parliament and of the Indian 
government, and was made K.C.B.

NAPIER— NAPLES 



In January i860 Napier was appointed to the command of 
the 2nd division of the expedition to China under Sir Hope Grant, 
and took part in the action of Sinho, the storm of the Peiho 
forts, and the entry to Peking. For his services he received the 
thanks of parliament, and was promoted major-general for 
distinguished service in the field. For the next four years Napier 
was military member of the council of the governor-general 
of India and, on the sudden death of Lord Elgin, for a short 
time acted as governor-general, until the arrival of Sir W. T. 
Denison from Madras. In January 1865 he was given the com- 
mand of the Bombay army, in March 1867 he was promoted 
lieutenant-general, and, later in that year, appointed to command 
the expedition to Abyssinia, selecting his own troops and making 
all the preparations for the campaign. He arrived at Annesley 
Bay in the Red Sea early in January 1868, reached Magdala, 
420 m. from the coast, in April; stormed the stronghold, freed 
the captives, razed the place to the ground, returned to the 
coast, and on the 18th June the last man of the expedition had 
left Africa. He received for his services the thanks of parlia- 
ment, a pension, a peerage, the G.C.B. and the G. C.S.I. The 
freedom of the cities of London and Edinburgh was conferred 
upon him, with presentation swords, and the universities 
bestowed upon him honorary degrees. In 1869 he was elected 
a fellow of the Royal Society. He held the command-in-chief 
in India for six years from 1870, during which he did much to 
benefit the army and to encourage good shooting. He was 
promoted general in 1874, and appointed a colonel-commandant 
of the Royal Engineers. In 1876 he was the guest of the German 
crown prince at the military manoeuvres, and from that year 
until 1883 held the government and command of Gibraltar. 
In the critical state of affairs in 1877 he was nominated com- 
mander-in-chief of the force which it was proposed to send to 
Constantinople. In 1879 he was a member of the royal com- 
mission on army organization, and in November of that year 
he represented Queen Victoria at Madrid as ambassador extra- 
ordinary on the occasion of the second marriage of the king of 
Spain. On the 1st of January 1883 he was promoted to be field- 
marshal, and in December 1886 appointed Constable of the 
Tower of London. He died in London on the 14th of January 
1890. His remains received a state funeral, and were buried 
in St Paul's Cathedral on the 21st of January. He was twice 
married, and left a large family by each wife, his eldest son, 
Robert William (b. 1845), succeeding to his barony. A statue 
of him on horseback by Boehm was erected at Calcutta when 
he left India, and a replica of it was afterwards set up to his 
memory in Waterloo Place, London. 

NAPIER, a seaport on the east coast of North Island, New 
Zealand, capital of the provincial district of Hawke's Bay, 
200 m. by rail N.E. of Wellington. Pop. (1906) 9454. The 
main portion of the town stretches along the fiat shoreland of 
Hawke's Bay, while the suburbs extend over the hills to the north. 
The site consists of a picturesque peninsula known as Scinde 
Island. The harbour (Port Ahuriri) is sheltered by a break- 
water. The cathedral church of St John (1888) for the bishopric 
of Waiapu, is one of the finest ecclesiastical buildings in New 
Zealand, imitating the Early English style in brick. An 
athenaeum, a small hospital, a lunatic asylum, a philosophical 
society and an acclimatization society are among the public 
institutions. The town (named after Sir Charles James Napier) 
is under municipal government, and returns a member to the 
New Zealand House of Representatives. The district is agri- 
cultural, and large quantities of wool and tinned and frozen 
meats are exported. There is railway communication with 
Wellington, New Plymouth, and the Wairarapa, Wanganui 
and Manawatu districts. Numerous old native pas or fortified 
villages are seen in the neighbourhood. 

NAPLES (Ital. Napoli, and Lat. Neapolis), formerly the capital 
of the kingdom of the Two Sicilies, and since i860 the chief town 
of the province which bears its name, the smallest province 
in the kingdom of Italy. It is the largest city in the country, 
containing 547,503 inhabitants in 1901. It is a prefecture; 
the see of a cardinal archbishop; the residence of the general 



commanding the tenth Army Corps and of the admiral com- 
manding the second Naval Department of Italy; and it 
possesses also an ancient and important university. 

Naples disputes with Constantinople the claim of occupying 
the most beautiful site in Europe. It is situated on the northern 
shore of the Bay of Naples (Sinus Cumanus), in 40 52' N., 
1 4° 15' 45" E., as taken from the lighthouse on the mole. By 
rail it is distant 151 m. from Rome, but the line is circuitous, 
and a direct electric line was contemplated in 1907, to run nearer 
the coast and shorten the distance from the capital by more than 
30 m. (For map, see Italy.) The circuit of the bay is about 
35 m. from the capo di Miseno on the north-west to the Punta 
della Campanella on the south-east, or more than 52 m. if the 
islands of Ischia, at the north-west, and of Capri, at the south 
entrance, be included. At its opening between these two islands 
it is 14 m. broad; while another 4 m. separates Capri from the 
mainland at the Punta della Campanella, and from the opening 
to its head at Portici the distance is 15 m. It affords good 
anchorage, with nearly 7 fathoms of water, and is well sheltered, 
except from winds which blow from points between south-east 
and south-west. In the latter winds Sorrento should be especially 
avoided, as no safe anchorage can be found there at less than 
15 fathoms, and the same remark applies to Capri with winds 
from S.W. to N,W. There is a perceptible tide of nearly 9 in. 

On the north-east shore east of Naples is an extensive flat, forming 
part of the ancient Campania Felix, and watered by the small stream 
Sebeto and by the Sarno, which last in classical times formed the 
port of Pompeii. From this flat, between the sea and the range of the 
Apennines, rises Mount Vesuvius, at the base of which, on or near the 
sea-shore, are the populous villages of San Giovanni Teduccio, 
Portici, Resina, Torre del Greco, Torre dell' Annunziata, &c, and the 
classic ^ sites of Herculaneum and Pompeii. At the south-east 
extremity of the plain, 3 m. beyond the outlet of the Sarno, a great 
offshoot of the Apennines, branching from the main range near Cava, 
and projecting as a peninsula more than 12 m. west, divides the 
pay of Naples from the bay of Salerno (Sinus Paestanus), and ends 
in the bold promontory of the Punta della Campanella (Promon- 
torium Minervae), which is separated by a strait 01 4 m. from Capri. 
On the north slope of this peninsula, where the plain ends and the 
coast abruptly bends to the west, stands the town of Castellammare, 
near the site of Stabiae, at the foot of Monte Sant* Angelo, which 
rises suddenly from the sea to a height of 4722 ft. Farther west, 
and nearly opposite to Naples across the bay, are Vico, Meta, 
Sorrento, Massa and many villages. 

The north-west shore to the west of Naples is more broken 
and irregular. The promontory of Posilipo, which projects d ue south , 
divides this part of the bay into two smaller bays — the eastern, with 
the city of Naples, and the western, or Bay of Baiae, which is sheltered 
from all winds. A tunnel through the promontory, 2244 ft. long, 
21 ft. broad, and in some places as much as 70 ft. high, possibly 
constructed by Marcus Agrippa in 27 B.C., forms the so-called grotto 
of Posilipo; at the Naples end stands the reputed tomb of Virgil. 
Beyond Posilipo is the small island of Nisida (Nests) ; and at a short 
distance inland are the extinct craters of Solfatara and Astroni and 
the lake of Agnano. Farther west, onthe coast, and provided with a 
convenient harbour, stands Pozzuoli (Puteoli), a city containing 
many Roman remains, but now chiefly remarkable for the large gun- 
works erected by Messrs Armstrong & Co. ; and beyond it, round the 
Bay of Baiae, are Monte Nuovo, a hill thrown up in a single night 
in September 1538; the classic site of Baiae; the Lucrine Lake; 
Lake Avernus; the Lake of Fusaro (Acherusia Palus); the Elysian 
Fields; and the port a nd^ promontory ofMiscnum. Still farther to 
the south-west lie the islands of Procida -(Prochyta) and Ischia 
(Pilkecusa, Aenaria or Inarime), which divide the Bay of Naples 
from the extensive Bay of Gaeta. All this country was comprised 
in classical times underthe title of < the Phlegrean Fields, and was 
certainly then more actively volcanic thanit now is, although the 
severe shock of earthquake which occurred in the island of Ischia in 
1883 completely destroyed Casamicciola, and did serious damage 
to Forio, Lacco Ameno and Serrara Fontana, shows that there is 
great seismic activity in the locality. The whole region abounds 
wkh^ fissures from which steam highly charged with hydrochloric 
acid is continually issuing, and in many places boiling water is found 
at a very few feet below the surface. 

The city of Naples is built at the base and on the slopes of a 
range of volcanic hills, and, rising from the shore like an amphi- 
theatre, is seen to best advantage from the sea. From the summit 
occupied by the castle of St Elmo a transverse ridge runs south 
to form the promontory of Pizzofalcone, and divides the city into 
two natural crescents. The western crescent, known as the 
Chiaja ward, though merely a long narrow strip between the sea 



NAPLES

and Vomero hill, is the fashionable quarter most frequented 
by foreign residents and visitors. A fine broad street, the Riviera 
di Chiaja, begun in the close of the 16th century by Count 
d'Olivares, and completed by the duke de Medina Ceh" (1695- 

1700), runs for a mile and a half from east to west, ending in 
the quarter of Mergellina and Piedigrotta at the foot of the hill 
of Posilipo. In front lie the Villa Communale (first called Reale 
and subsequently Nazionale) public gardens, the chief promenade 
of the city, which were first laid out in 1780, and have been 
successively extended in 1807, in 1834, and again in recent years; 
and the whole edge of the bay from the Castel dell' Ovo to 
Mergellina is lined by a massive embankment and carriage- 
way, the Via Caracciolo, constructed in 1875-1881. The eastern 

crescent includes by far the largest as well as the oldest portion 
of Naples — the ports, the arsenal, the principal churches, &c. 
The best-known thoroughfare is the historic Toledo (as it is 
still popularly called, though the official name is Via Roma) 
which runs almost due north from the Piazza (Largo) del 
Plebiscito in front of the Palazzo Reale, till, as Strada Nuova 
Di Capodimonte, crossing the Ponte della Sanita (constructed 
by Murat across the valley between Santa Teresa and Capodi- 
monte), it reaches the gates of the Capodimonte palace. A 
drive, the Corso Vittorio Emmanuole, winds along the slopes 
behind tbe city from the Str. di Piedigrotta (at the west end of 
the Riv. di Chiaja) till it reaches the museum by the Via Salvator 
Rosa. The character of the shore of the eastern crescent has been 
much altered by the new harbour works, which with the wharves 
and warehouses have absorbed the Villa del Popolo, or People's 
Park, originally constructed on land reclaimed from the bay. 

The streets of Naples are generally well-paved with large 
blocks of lava or volcanic basalt. In the older districts there is 
a countless variety of narrow gloomy streets, many of them 
steep. The houses are mostly five or six storeys high, are 
covered with stucco made of a kind of pozzolana which hardens 
by exposure, and have large balconies and flat roofs. The castle 
of S. Elmo (S. Ermo, S. Erasmus), which dominates the whole 
city, had its origin in a fort (Belforte) erected by King Robert 
the Wise in 1543. The present building, with its rock-hewn 
fosses and massive ramparts, was constructed by Don Pedro de 
Toledo at the command of Charles V. in 1535, and was long 
considered practically impregnable. Damaged by lightning in 
1857, it was afterwards restored, and is now a military prison. 
On a small island (I. del Salvatore, the Megaris of Pliny), now 
joined to the shore at the foot of the Pizzofalcone by an arch- 
supported causeway, stands the Castel dell* Ovo (so called from 
its shape, though medieval legend associates the name with the 
enchanted egg on which the magician Virgil made the safety of 
the city to depend), which dates from 11 54. The walls of its 
chapel were frescoed by Giotto; but the whole building was 
ruined by Ferdinand II. in 1495, and had to be restored in the 
1 6th century. Castel Nuovo, a very picturesque building con- 
structed near the harbour in 1283 by Charles I. of Anjou, contains 
between the round towers of its facade the triumphal arch 
erected in 1470 to Alphonso I. and renovated in 1905. It 
numbers among its chambers the Gothic hall of Giovanni Pisano 
in which Celestine V. abdicated the papal dignity. Castel del 
Carmine, founded by Ferdinand I. in 1484, was occupied by the 
populace in Masaniello's insurrection, was used as a prison for 
the patriots of 1796, became municipal property in 1878, and is 
now a prison. The royal palace, begun in 1600 by the Count de 
Lemos, from designs by Domenico Fontana, partly burned in 
1837, and since repaired and enlarged by Ferdinand II., is an 
enormous building with a sea frontage of 800 ft. and a main 
facade 554 ft. long and 95 ft. high, exhibiting the Doric, Ionic 
and Composite orders in its three storeys. The statues on the 
facade of the palace were erected by King Humbert I. in 1885, 
and represent the titular heads of the various dynasties which 
have reigned at Naples, beginning with Ruggiero the Norman 
(1130); followed by Frederick II. of.Suabia (1197); Charles I. 
of Anjou (1266); Alfonso of Aragon (1442); Charles V. of Spain 
(1527); Charles III. (Bourbon) of Naples (1744); Gioacchino 
Murat (1808); and Victor Emmanuel II. (1861). 



Naples is the see of a Roman Catholic archbishop, always a 
cardinal. The cathedral has a chapter of thirty canons, and of 
the numerous religious houses formerly existing very few have 
in whole or in part survived the suppression in 1868. The city is 
divided into fifty parishes purely for ecclesiastical purposes, and 
there are 237 Roman Catholic churches and 57 chapels. 

Most of the churches are remarkable rather for richness in internal 
decoration than for architectural beauty. The cathedra! of St 
Januarius, occupying the site of temples of Apollo and Neptune, 
and still containing some of their original granite columns, was 
designed by Nicola Pisano, and erected between 1272 and 1316. 
Owing to frequent restorations occasioned by earthquakes, it now 
presents an incongruous mixture of different styles. The general 
pjan is that of a basilica with a nave and two (Gothic vaulted) 
aisles separated by pilasters. The western facade is of marble and 
was completed in 1006. Beneath the high altar is a subterranean 
chapel containing the tomb of^ St Januarius (San Gennaro), the 
patron saint of the city; in the right aisle there is a chapel (Cappella 
del Tesoro) built between 1608 and 1637 in popular recognition of 
his having saved Naples in 1527 " from famine, war, plague and the 
fire of Vesuvius " ; and in a silver tabernacle behind the high altar 
of this chapel^ are preserved the two phials partially filled with his- 
blood, the periodical liquefaction of which forms a prominent feature 
in the religious life of the city. Accessible by a door in the left 
aisle of the cathedral is the church of Sta Restituta, a basilica of 
the 7th century, and the original cathedral. Santa Chiara (14th 
century) is interesting for a fresco ascribed to Giotto (at one time 
there were many more), and monuments to Robert the Wise, his- 
queen Mary of Valois and his daughter Mary, empress of Constanti- 
nople. San Domenico Maggiore, founded by Charles II. in 1285, 
but completely restored after 1445, has an effective interior particu- 
larly rich in Renaissance sculpture. In the neighbouring monastery 
is shown the cell of Thomas Aquinas. San Filippo Neri or dei 
Gerolomini, erected in the close of the 16th century, has a white 
marble facade and two campaniles, and contains the tombstone of 
Giambattista Vico. Sta Maria del Parto, in the Chiaja, occupies- 
the site of the house of Sannazaro, and is named after his poem De 
Partu Virginis, San Francesco di Paolo, opposite the royal palace, 
is an imitation of the Pantheon at Rome by Pietro Bianchi di Lugano 
(1815-1837), and its dome is one of the boldest in Europe. The 
church of the Certosa (Carthusian monastery) of San Martino, on 
the hill below St Elmo's castle, has now become in name, as so 
many of the churches are in reality, a museum. Dating from the 
14th century, and restored by Fonsega in the 17th, it is a building 
of extraordinary richness of decoration, with paintings and sculpture 
by Guido Rem, Lanfranco, Caravaggio, D'Arpino, Solimene, Luca 
Giordano and notably a " Descent from the Cross " by Ribera, con- 
considered the finest work of this master. The monastery has been 
transformed into a medieval museum, where many specimens- 
illustrating the modern history of Naples may be studied, and some 
fine specimens of # majolica from the southern provinces can be 
inspected. The view from the south-western balcony is incompar- 
able. The marble cloister by Fonsega, though rather flamboyant in 
character, is one of the finest of its kind in existence. Other churches 
with interesting monuments are Sant' Anna dei Lombardi, built 
in 141 1 by Guerrello Origlia, which contains some splendid marble 
sculpture, especially Rosellino's " Nativity "in the Cappella Picco- 
lomini; Sant Angelo a Nilo, which contains the tomb of Cardinal 
Brancaccio, the joint work of Donatello and Michelozzo; San 
Giovanni a Carbonara, built in 1344 and enlarged by King Ladislaus- 
in 1400, which contains among much other remarkable sculpture the 
tomb of the king, the masterpiece of Andrea Ciccione (1414), and 
that of Sergiami Caracciolo, the favourite of Joanna II., who was- 
murdered in 1432 (the chapel in which it stands is paved with one 
of the earliest majolica pavements in Italy); San Lorenzo (1324), 
the Royal Church of the House of Anjou; and, for purely archaeo- 
logical^ interest, the Church of Sant' Aspreno, thought to be the oldest 
Christian church in Italy, in the crypt of the new Borsa or exchange. 
Persons interested in frescoes will admire those in the former monas- 
tery at the back of the church of S. Maria Donna Regina and those in 
the cloister of S. Severino and Sossio. A more ancient Christian 
monument than any of the convents or churches is the catacombs, 
which extend a great distance underground and are in many respects 
finer than those at Rome. The entrance is at the Ospizio dei Poveri 
di San Gennaro (see Schulze's monograph, Jena, 1877). 

Of the secular institutions in Naples none is more remarkable 
than the National Museum, formerly known as the Museo 
Borbonico. The building, begun in 1586 for vice-regal stables, 
and remodelled in 161 5 for the university, was put to its present 
use in 1790, when Ferdinand IV. proclaimed it his private 
property independently of the crown, placed in it the Farnese 
collection which he had inherited from his father, and all the 
specimens from Herculaneum, Pompeii, Stabiae, Puteoli, 
Paestum, &c, which till then had been housed in the palace at 
Portici, and gave it the name of Real Museo Borbonico. In i860

Garibaldi, when dictator at Naples, proclaimed the museum 
and the territory devoted to excavation to be the property of 
the nation, since which time it has been called the National 
Museum. Vast numbers of specimens have since been added to 
it both by purchase and from excavations, and it is now unique 
as a treasure house of Italo-Greek and Roman antiquities, 
besides containing a fine library and an important collection of 
pictures. 

A large additional space for exhibits was made in 1904, when the 
western half of the second floor was added, and the building as now 
arranged contains the large bronzes and statues on the ground 
floor; a gallery of Pompeian frescoes in the entresol; the library, 
picture gallery and small bronzes on the first floor; and the glass, 
jewelry, arms, papyri, gems, and the unique collection of Italo- 
Greek vases, on the second floor. The large bronzes are almost the 
only ones which have survived from classical times, the most famous 
of them being the seated Mercury and the dancing Faun; 
the marbles reckon among their vast number the Psyche, the 
Capuan Venus, the portraits of Homer and Julius Caesar, as well 
as the huge group called the Toro Farnese (Amphion and Zethus 
tying Dirce to its horns), the Farnese Hercules, the excellent 
though late statues of the Balbi on horseback and a very fine 
collection of ancient portrait busts. 

Modem Buildings. — The Galleria Umberto I. is a large cruci- 
form arcade opened in 1890. It somewhat resembles the Milan 
arcade, and has an octagon in the centre, with a cupola. It is 
highly ornamented with gilt and stucco. A music-hall occupies 
the basement. The Galleria Principe di Napoli is in a smaller 
arcade opposite to the National Museum, mainly occupied by 
shops where reproductions from the museum are sold. The 
Galleria Vittoria, opened in 1907, is a circular building with 
handsome dome, situated near the main entrance of the Villa 
Communale. It is in great part occupied by offices and shops. 
The Anglican church in Vico San Pasquale was built in 1862 on 
ground given to the British community by Garibaldi when 
dictator, and was the first Protestant church erected in Naples. 
Since the granting of religious liberty evangelical churches have 
been built by the Presbyterians, Wesleyans, French, Germans and 
Italians. A Greek church and a Jewish synagogue have also 
been opened. The Borsa (or exchange) is a fine building in the 
Piazza of the same name, built over the remains of the very 
ancient church of Sant* Aspreno, which are still preserved in the 
crypt. In front of it is the fine 16th-century Fontana Medina. 

Educational and Learned Institutions. — The university of Naples 
is one of the oldest in Italy, having been founded by Frederick II. 
in the first half of the 13th century. It had fallen to insignificance 
under the Bourbons, but since i860 it has rapidly recovered. It 
comprises five faculties (literature and philosophy, jurisprudence, 
mathematics, natural science and medicine), and is well equipped 
with zoological, mineralogical and geological museums, a physio- 
logical institute, a cabinet of anthropology, and botanical gardens* 
Originally erected in 1557 for the use of the Jesuits, the university 
buildings are regarded as the best work of Marco di Pino; the 
quadrangle, surrounded by a simple but effective peristyle, contains 
statues of Pietro della Vigna (Frederick's chancellor), Thomas 
Aquinas and Giordano Bruno. The new building, the shell of which 
was completed in 1906, faces the Rettifilo, a new wide street which 
leads from the Borsa in a straight line to the railway station; at 
the back it joins the former building, which is at a higher level. 
On the other or north side of the ancient building, and at the back of 
the Strada Constant inopoli, very large annexes have been formed 
for the medical school. The famous zoological station at Naples, 
whose aquarium is the principal building in the Villa Communale, 
is not connected with the university. Itwas founded by Dr Dohrn 
in 1872; a. large annexe was added to it a few years later on its 
western side, and a larger annexe on the eastern side was completed 
in 1907. The aquarium was originally established at Naples because 
the flora and fauna of the neighbourhood are more varied than 
those of any district in Europe. Its Mittheilungen began to be pub- 
lished in 1878, and portions of a great work on the flora and fauna 
of Naples come out year by year. It is justly considered the first 
as well as the oldest of the zoological stations of the world, and the 
chief universities pay £100 b. year for tables to which they send 
-students. At these tables every necessary is provided, each student 
having his own tanks with salt water laid on for keeping his speci- 
mens, and all necessary chemicals being provided. Of other scientific 
institutions we may mention the observatory on Vesuvius, which is 
'supported entirely by funds from the government, but is annexed 
informally to the university. Its object is to record earth-movements 
and volcanic phenomena. The Specola or astronomical observatory 
is also a government institution, and forms no official part of the 
university. It is situated on the hill of Capodimonte. 

The Royal Society of Naples, dating from 1756, was reconstituted 



in 1 86 1, and is divided into three academies, namely: moral and 
political; physical and mathematical ; letters, archaeology and 
fine arts. The famous Accademia Pontaniana, founded by Antonio 
Becardella (surnamed Panormita owing to his origin from Palermo) 
and J. J. Pontanus in 1442, was restored in 1808 and still exists. 
The Royal School for Oriental Languages owes its existence to 
Matteo Ripa,who in 1732 established a school for Chinese mission- 
aries. The Royal Conservatory of Music in S. Pietro a Majella has 
existed in one form or other since 1760, and has had many famous 
pupils. 

Elementary education has proceeded with great rapidity, and 
there are ninety public elementary shools in the city, twenty-three 
ecclesiastical gratuitous schools and many evangelical schools at a 
very small payment. The higher grade schools are also numerous, 
and there are special foreign schools established by private enterprise 
for the education of the children of foreign residents. There are three 
schools for the blind and two for deaf-mutes. 

Libraries — The state archives in Vico San Severo e Sossio contain 
all the records of past governments; the Notarial archives in Via 
San Paolo contain all the original notarial acts from 1450 onwards, 
to the number of 800,000. The Royal national library in the building 
of the national museum contains 364,000 volumes and 7835 manu- 
scripts, many of which are of great value. The musical archives are 
kept here as a separate department. The Royal library of San 
Giacomo (100,000 vols.) hacl its origin in the Palace library of the 
Bourbon times. There may also be mentioned the Royal University 
library, the Royal Brancacciana library in Via Donnaromita, with 
125,000 vols, and 2000 important MSS., the Gerolomini library, 
mainly of ecclesiastical books and codices, and the Provincial library 
in Via Duomo, consisting mainly of technical books. The Biblioteca 
Communale, and the rich collection of seismic and vulcanological 
books made bythe Italian Alpine Club, are both in charge of the 
Societa di Storia Patria. This literary society was established in 
l %75* by a committee of private gentlemen anxious to record all 
possible details of the history of the locality. It has a good though 
not perfect collection of the early Neapolitan newspapers, a complete 
file of the principal modern ones and many interesting MSS. The 
society is governed by a council of literary men, and issues publi- 
cations from time to time. The Zoological Station or Aquarium 
has a very fine biological library. 

Theatres. — The San Carlo opera-house, with its area of 5157 sq. 
yds. and its pit capable of seating 1000 spectators, is one of the 
largest in Europe. It was originally built in 1737 under Charles III., 
but was destroyed by fire in 1816 and completely rebuilt. It was 
heavily subsidized in the Bourbon times, but now, except for giving 
the house, which is the property of the municipality, no assistance 
is granted from the public funds. The Mercadante is also a municipal 
theatre, but has no subsidy. The Bellini is a fine opera-house near 
the t museum, and the other chief theatres are the Sannazzaro, 
Politeama and Fiorentini. Numerous music halls have sprung up 
of late years, of which the principal is the Salone Marghenta in the 
basement of the Galleria Umberto Primo. 

Charities. — Charitable institutions are numerous in Naples. The 
Reclusorio or poorhouse was founded in the 18th century, and besides 
being a refuge for the indigent poor has a series of industrial schools 
attached, at which foundling boys are educated and taught trades. 
The principal hospitals are the Incurabili, Gesu e Maria, Santa Maria 
della Pace and a hospital for poor priests, which are all under the 
same management. The Pellegrini is exclusively surgical; the Santa 
Maria di Loreto is especially for the inmates of the Reclusorio and 
for street accidents; the Ospedale Lina for children; and the 
Ospedale Cotugno for infectious diseases. There is also an Inter- 
national hospital for the treatment of others than Italians, which 
was built by Lady Harriet Bentinck and is managed by an inter- 
national committee; a German hospital; and a hospital erected 
by the representatives of Baron Adolphe de Rothschild. There are 
two public lunatic asylums in the city, and another at the neighbour- 
ing town of Aversa; and many private asylums, among which 
Fleurent, Miano and Ponti Rossi may be mentioned. 

Harbour.-^ht a very early date the original harbour at Naples, 
now known in its greatly reduced state as Porto Piccolo, and fit only 
for boats and lighters, became too small. In 1302 Charles II. of 
Anjou began the construction of the Porto Grande by forming the 
Molo Grande or San Gennaro, which stretched eastward into the 
bay, and was terminated by a lighthouse in the 15th century. By 
the addition of a new pier running north-east from the lighthouse, 
and protected by a heavily armed battery, Charles III. in 1740 
a'dded greatly to the safety of the harbour. In 1826 the open area 
to the south of the Porto Grande was formed'into the Porto Militare 
by the construction of the Molo San Vincenzo, 1200 ft. long. Shortly 
after the formation of the new kingdom of Italy attention was called 
to the insufficiency of the harbour for modern wants ; and new works 
were begun in 1862. Besides the lengthening of the Molo San 
Vincenzo to a total of more than 5000 ft., the scheme as now carried 
out has completely revolutionized the harbour. A cross piece at the 
end of the Molo San Vincenzo has made the head of that structure 
into the form of the Greek letter gamma, thus affording considerable 
protection to the anchorage. New quays have been made all the 
way from the old Immacolatella landing-place to the new and 
spacious Capitaneria di Porto, on the eastern side of which is a new 



NAPLES

harbour used mainly for the coal trade, and piers such that the largest 
liner can lie alongside the jetty. The outer mole of this harbour runs 
out from the Castel del Carmine towards the south for some 1500 ft. 
and forms the inner side of the new steam basin, which when nearly 
completed in 1906 fell in on the farther side, and had to be re- 
constructed. The depth of this new harbour is from 25 to 30 ft. 
There are two projecting moles, one to the inner harbour and the 
second to the steam basin. In 1905 the total tonnage entering the 
port amounted to 4,698,872 tons, of which the Italians (including 
their coasting trade) carried 1,410,192 tons in 3687 vessels; the 
Germans 1,391,585 tons in 356 vessels; the British 1,136,345 tons 
in 402 vessels; and the French 245,206 tons in 161 vessels. Naples 
is the principal port for emigration, chiefly to North and South 
America; 281 emigrant ships sailed in 1905, carrying 216,103 emi- 
grants. The total imports for that year reached the sum of £5,397,918, 
and the exports £3,367,805^ The articles dealt in are wine, oil, 
spirits, drugs, tobacco, chemicals, hemp, cotton, wool, silk, timber, 
paper, leather and hides, metal, glass, cereals and live animals. 
The largest export was to the United States (£864,562), the next to 
Great Britain (£701,387), while the largest imports were from Great 
Britain (£1,233,410) and the United States (£807,564). The speciali- 
ties of Naples are the manufacture of coral, tortoise-shell, kid gloves 
and macaroni, but it has been growing also as an industrial centre. 
The port of Naples is second in the kingdom, and owns no rival save 
Genoa. 

Water Supply. — Since 1884 Naples has had as fine a water supply 
as any city in Europe. It is derived from the hills in the neighbour- 
hood of Avellino, and is thought to be the effluent of an underground 
lake. It rushes out from the hillside and is received in a covered 
masonry canal, whence it flows in large iron pipes till it reaches five 
enormous reservoirs constructed just opposite to the entrance gates 
of the royal palace at Capodimonte. Hence it comes by natural 
gravitation into the town at a pressure of five atmospheres, so that it 
supplies the highest parts of the town with abundant water. The 
water is so cold that in the hottest summer perishable articles can be 
preserved by merely securing them in a closed vessel and allowing 

Jthe water to drip upon it. The supply was" brought into the town 
just after the terrible cholera outbreak of 1884, and as each new 
standpipe was erected in the streets every well within 200 yds. of 
it was closed, so that in a short time no well remained in the town ; 
and thus a fertile source of infection was eliminated. Every house 
in the town and suburbs is now supplied with a constant supply of 
pure water. The effect on the health of the city has been extra- 
ordinary. Cholera epidemics, which used to be frequent, have 
become things of the past, and there is now abundant water for public 
fountains, washing the streets and watering gardens both public 
and private. The old sewers were found quite inadequate to carry 
off the large increase of water, and besides they all led directly into 
the bay, causing a terrible odour and rendering the water near the 
town unwholesome for bathing. t This has been remedied by a 
system of sewers, which after passing by a tunnel through the hill of 
Posilipo cross the plain beyond and discharge their contents into the 
open sea on the deserted coast of Cumae, 17 m. f romthe city of Naples. 
The old aqueduct, which was constructed in the 17th century by 
Carnignano and Criminelli and taps the 1 sclera at Sant' Agata dei 
Goti, is still available to a certain extent, but its water was never 
very wholesome, and as it was not laid on to houses but only supplied 
fountains and house cisterns which have since been filled up, no 
account need be taken of it. The solitary Leone fountain, a spring 
which supplied drinking water to the west end of the town, has been 
dry for many years. 

Modern Growth. — Naples, the most densely peopled city in 
Europe, has increased in modern times at an enormous rate. 
On the large areas reclaimed from the sea, vast hotels and 
mansions let in flats have been erected. The gardens at the west 
end of the town are all built over. The Vomero, once merely a 
scattered village, is now an important suburb, and a large 
workmen's quarter has sprung up beyond the railway station to 
house the populace which was turned out from the centre of the 
town when the works of the risanamento were undertaken. The 
increase in population between the census of 1881, when it was 
461,962, and the census in 1901 was 85,521. The commune, 
which includes not only the urban districts (sezioni) of San 
Ferdinando, Chiaja, S. Giuseppe, Monte Calvario, Awocata, 
Stella, San Carlo all' Arena, Vicaria, San Lorenzo, Mercato, 
Pendino and Porto, but also the suburban districts of Vomero, 
Posilipo, Fuorigrotta, Miano and Piscinola, has been built over 
in every direction, one great incentive being the creation of an 
industrial zone to the eastward of the city. This zone has been 
set aside for the purpose of industrial development, and all persons 
or companies who set up industrial concerns on it have grants 
of land at a nominal price, are free of taxes for ten years and 
have electric force supplied to them at a very low figure. The 
law came into force in 1906, and was immediately followed by 



the erection of a large number of factories, for spinning silk, 
cotton, jute and wool, and the making of railway plant, auto- 
mobiles, the building of ships, and in fact almost every kind of 
industry. After the cholera epidemic of 1884, M. Depretis, then 
premier, visited Naples, and in the course of a public speech 
gave vent to the famous dictum " Bisogna sventrare Napoli " — 
" Naples must be disembowelled! " Plans were at once made to 
pull down all the worst slums, and as these lay between the 
centre of the town and the railway station, a wide street was 
constructed from the centre of the town to the eastward, and 
on each side of it wide strips of ground were cleared to afford 
building sites for shops and offices. The funds for this vast 
undertaking were found partly by the state, which voted 
£3,000,000, and as to the rest by the Risanamento Company, 
which had a capital of £1,200,000. Before beginning operations 
of demolition it was obviously necessary to provide homes for 
the poor people who would be turned out, and a large working- 
class quarter was erected to the north and beyond the railway 
station. This quarter has wide airy streets and lofty houses, 
and though perhaps the houses were let at prices which were 
beyond the purses of the lowest class, the result of their erection 
was to cause a number of the poorer houses in the old town to 
be vacated, thus giving an opportunity to the lowest class to 
be at any rate better housed than they were before. The quarter 
described above is known as the Paone Vasto. There are also 
new middle-class quarters at Santa Lucia, Vomero Nuovo and 
Sant' Efremo, and better houses in the Via Sirignano, on the 
Riviera di Chiaja, Via Elena and Via Caracciolo at Mergellina, 
Via Partenope near the Chiatamone, and an aristocratic quarter 
in the large extensions made in the Rione Amedeo. The narrow 
alleys of Porto, Pendino and Mercato have nearly all disappeared, 
and old Naples has been vanishing day by day. One notable 
result of the widening of the streets has been the spread of the 
electric tramways, which traverse the town in various directions 
and are admirably served by a Belgian company. The city is 
mainly lighted by electricity, which has also found its way into 
all the public edifices and most private houses. 

Folk-lore. — The attention of antiquarians to the charms against 
the Evil Eye used by the inhabitants of the Neapolitan provinces 
was first drawn in 1 888, when it was shown that they were all 
derived from the survival of ancient classical legends which had 
sprung from various sources in connexion with classical sites in the 
neighbourhood. These may be divided into three classes: first, 
the sprig of rue in silver, with sundry emblems attached to it, all 
of which refer to the worship of Diana, whose shrine at Capua was 
of considerable importance; secondly, the serpent charms, which 
formed part of the worship of Aesculapius, and were no doubt derived 
largely from the ancient eastern t ophiolatry ; and lastly charms 
derived from the legends of the Sirens. A special confirmation is 
given in this case, as the Siren is represented mounted on her sea- 
horse crossing the Styx upon the vase of Pluto and Proserpine in the 
collection of the Naples Museum. This vase dates about 250 B.C., 
and the Siren charms represent her in the same way, but usually 
mounted on two sea-horses. The sea-horse and the Siren alone are 
commonly found as charms ; the Siren being sometimes in her 
fishtail form and sometimes in the form of a harpy. 

History. — All ancient writers agree in representing Naples as 
a Greek settlement, though its foundation is obscurely and 
differently narrated. The earliest Greek settlement in the 
neighbourhood was at Pithecusa (Ischia), but the colonists, 
being driven out of the island by the frequent earthquakes, 
settled on the mainland at Cumae, where they found a natural 
acropolis of great strategic value. From Cumae they colonized 
Dikearchia (Pozzuoli) and probably subsequently Palaeopolis. 
The site of Palaeopolis has given rise to much discussion, but the 
researches by R. T. Gunther open completely new ground, and 
seem to be the correct solution of the problem. He places 
Palaeopolis at Gaiola Point and has discovered the remains of 
the harbour, the town hall and various other rudiments of the 
ancient city. This site, moreover, corresponds with Livy's 
testimony, and would account for his statement that the towns 
of Palaeopolis and Neapolis were near together and identical in 
language and government. This opinion about the site of Palae- 
opolis has been based on the very considerable alterations which 
are known to have taken place in the level of the land, and the 



l82 



NAPLES, KINGDOM OF 



extensive submerged foundations of buildings off the southern ex- 
tremity of Posilipo have been identified with those of the old city. 

Parthenope, as well as Dikearchia, was formed as a new colony 
from Cumae, and was so called from a legendary connexion of 
the locality with the siren of that name, whose tomb was still 
shown in the time of Strabo. Parthenope was situated where 
Naples now stands, upon the splendid natural acropolis formed 
by the hill of Pizzofalcone, and defended on the land side by a 
fosse which is now the Strada di Chiaja, and a massive wall, of 
which remains may still be traced at the back of the existing 
houses. To the colonists of Parthenope there came afterwards 
a considerable addition from Athens and Chalcis, and they 
built themselves a town which they called Neapolis y or the " new 
city," in contradistinction to the old settlement, which- in con- 
sequence was styled Palaeopolis or the " old city." The name 
of Parthenope became lost, and the city of Palaeopolis fell into 
gradual decadence. 

In 328 B.C. the Palaeopolitans having provoked the hostility 
of Rome by their incursions upon her Campanian allies, the 
consul Publihus Philo marched against them, and having taken 
his position between the old and the new city, laid regular siege 
to Palaeopolis. By the aid of a strong Samnite garrison which 
they received, the Palaeopolitans were long able to withstand the 
attacks of the consul; but at length the city was betrayed into 
the hands of the Romans by two of her citizens. Neapolis 
possibly surrendered to the consul without any resistance, as it 
was received on favourable terms, had its liberties secured by 
a treaty, and obtained the chief authority, which previously 
seems to have been enjoyed by the older city. From that time 
Palaeopolis totally disappeared from history, and Neapolis 
became an allied city (Joederata civitas) — a dependency of Rome, 
to whose alliance it remained constantly faithful, even in the 
most trying circumstances. In 280 B.C. Pyrrhus unsuccessfully 
attacked its walls; and in the Second Punic War Hannibal was 
deterred by their strength from attempting to make himself 
master of the town. During the civil wars of Marius and Sulla 
a body of partisans of the latter, having entered it by treachery 
(82 B.C.), made a general massacre of the inhabitants; but 
Neapolis soon recovered, as it was again a flourishing city in the 
time of Cicero. It became a municipium after the passing of the 
lex Julia; under the empire it is noticed as a colonia, but the 
time when it first obtained that rank is uncertain — possibly 
under Claudius. 

Though a municipal town, Neapolis long retained its Greek 
culture and institutions; and even at the time of Strabo it 
had gymnasia and quinquennial games, and was divided into 
phratriae after the Greek fashion. When the Romans became 
masters of the world, many of their upper classes, both before 
the close of the republic and under the empire, from a love of 
Greek manners and literature or from indolent and effeminate 
habits, resorted to Neapolis, either for the education and the 
cultivation of gymnastic exercises or for the enjoyment of music 
and of a soft and luxurious climate. Hence we find Neapolis 
variously styled — by Horace oliosa Neapolis, by Martial docta 
Parthenope, by Ovfd in otia natam Parthenopen. It was the 
favourite residence of many of the emperors; Nero made his 
first appearance on the stage in one of its theatres; Titus assumed 
the office of its archon; and Hadrian became its demarch. It 
was chiefly at Neapolis that Virgil composed his Georgics; and 
he was buried on the hill of Pausilypus, the modern Posilipo, in 
its neighbourhood. It was also the favourite residence of the 
poets Statius (a.d. 61) and Silius Italicus (a.d. 25), the former 
of whom was a Neapolitan by birth. 

After the fall of the Roman Empire, Neapolis suffered severely 
during the Gothic wars. Having espoused the Gothic cause in 
the year 536, it was taken, after a protracted siege, by Belisarius, 
who turned aside an aqueduct, marched by surprise into the city 
through its channel, and put many of the inhabitants to the 
sword. In 542 Totila besieged it and compelled it to surrender, 
but being soon after recovered by Narses, it remained long a 
dependency of the exarchate of Ravenna, under the immediate 
government of a duke, appointed by the East Roman emperors. 



When the Lombards invaded Italy and pushed their conquests 
in the southern provinces, the limits of the Neapolitan duchy 
were considerably narrowed. In the beginning of the 8th century, 
at the time of the iconoclastic controversy, the emperor Leo 
the Isaurian having forced compliance to his edict against the 
worshipping of images, the Neapolitans, encouraged by Pope 
Gregory III., threw off their allegiance to the Eastern emperors, 
and established a republican form of government under a duke 
of their own appointment. Under this regime Neapolis retained 
independence for nearly four hundred years, though constantly 
struggling against the powerful Lombard dukes of Benevento, who 
twice unsuccessfully besieged it. In 1027, however, Pandulf IV^, 
a Lombard prince of Capua, succeeded in making himself 
master of it; but he was expelled in 1030 by Duke Sergius, 
chiefly through the aid of a few Norman adventurers. The 
Normans, in their turn, gradually superseded all powers, whether 
Greek, Lombard or republican, which had previously divided 
the south of Italy, and furthermore checked the Saracens in the 
advances they were making through Apulia. 

From the date at which the south of Italy and Sicily were 
subjugated by the Normans the history of Naples ceases to be 
the history of a republic or a city, and becomes that of a kingdom, 
sometimes separate, sometimes merged, with the kingdom of 
Sicily, in that of the Two Sicilies. The city of Naples hence- 
forth formed the metropolis of the kingdom to which it gave its 
name, owing this pre-eminence to its advantageous position on 
the side of Italy towards Sicily, and to the favour of successive 
princes (see Naples, Kingdom of).

in the 16th century (" King of England and Naples ") and by 
Joseph Bonaparte and Joachim Murat in the 19th. The history 
of the kingdom of Naples is inextricably interwoven with that of 
Sicily, with which for long periods it was united as the kingdom 
of the Two Sicilies. 

For the earlier history of Naples and its territory, as a republic 
and a dukedom, see Naples above, and for the coming of the 
Normans see Sicily and Normans. It is sufficient here to state 
that the leaders of the house of Hauteville, Robert Guiscard and 
Richard of Aversa, in 1059 did homage to Pope Nicholas II. (q.v.) 
for all conquests they had made both in the island and upon the 
mainland, and that in 1130 Roger de Hauteville (Roger II. as 
" great count " of Sicily) assumed the style of king as Roger I. 
In this way the south of Italy, together with the adjacent island 
of Sicily, was converted into one political body, which, owing to 
the peculiar temper of its Norman rulers and their powerful 
organization, assumed a more feudal character than any other 
part of the peninsula. The regno, as it was called by the Italians, 
constituted a state apart, differing in social institutions, foreign 
relations, and type of home government, from the commonwealths 
and tyrannies of upper Italy. The indirect right acquired by 
the popes as lords paramount over this vast section of Italian 
territory gave occasion to all the most serious disturbances of 
Italy between the end of the 13th and the beginning of the 16th 
centuries, by the introduction of the house of Anjou into Naples 
and the disputed succession of Angevin and Aragonese princes. 

Roger I. was succeeded in 1154 by William I. "the Bad," 
who died in 1166, being succeeded by his son William II. " the 
Good," on whose death in 1189 the crown passed to 
his illegitimate son Tancred. After the death of m * k t 9 
Tancred the emperor Henry VI., of the house of s^u/fens. 
Hohenstaufen, who by his marriage with Constance 
or Costanza d' Altavilla, daughter of Roger I. (d. 1154), was

Tancred's rival for the kingdoms of Naples and Sicily, de- 
scended into Italy in 1194. He easily conquered both the 
mainland and the island, and Tancred's only son William III. 
surrendered the crown to him. But with the excuse of a pre- 
tended plot he put a number of the most conspicuous persons 
in the kingdoms to death, and had William himself blinded. 
He then returned to Germany, and during his absence an agita- 
tion broke out, proyjDked by the cruelty of his lieutenants and 
encouraged by his Norman wife. He hurrieji back to Italy, 
and repressed the movement with his usual ferocity, but died 
The in 1 197. Costanza then had her son Frederick 

emperor (b. 1 194) proclaimed king, and obtained the support 
Frederick f tlie Holy See on condition that the kingdom should 
lL be once more recognized as a fief of the church. The 

whole history of the ensuing period of south Italian history 
turns on the claims of the papacy over the kingdoms of Naples 
and Sicily, based on the recognition of papal suzerainty in 1053. 
The Hohenstaufen kings refused to admit this claim; hence the 
persistent hostility of the popes and the calling in of foreign 
potentates and armies. Costanza died in 1198, leaving Pope 
Innocent III. regent and tutor to her son; the pope's authority 
was contested by various nobles, but in 1209 Frederick married 
Costanza, daughter of the king of Aragon, with whose help he 
succeeded in reducing a large part of Sicily to obedience. Two 
years later he was elected king of the Romans at the diet 
of Nuremberg in opposition to Otto IV., and in 1220 he was 
crowned emperor in Rome by pope Honorius III., but continued 
to reside in Sicily. He quelled a rising of Sicilian barons and 
Saracens, and confined 60,000 of the latter at Lucera in Capi- 
tanata, where they ended by becoming a most loyal colony. 
After the death of Frederick's wife Pope Honorius III. arranged 
a marriage for him with Yolande, daughter of John of Brienne 
(1225). But in 1227 Gregory IX. excommunicated him because 
he delayed the crusade which he had promised to undertake; 
and although he sailed the following year, and concluded a 
treaty with the sultan of Egypt whereby the kingdom of 
Jerusalem was re-established, the pope was not satisfied and 
sent an army into Neapolitan territory. On his return Frederick 
defeated the pontificals, and in 1230 peace was made at San 
Germano and the excommunication withdrawn. In 1231 he 
issued the celebrated Constitutions of the Sicilian kingdom at 
the parliament of Melfi. He had further quarrels with successive 
pontiffs, and was excommunicated more than once. In 1246 a 
number of his own barons and officials of the mainland conspired 
against his rule, but were crushed with great ferocity, and even 
his faithful secretary, Pietro della Vigna, fell a victim to the 
emperor's suspicions. Frederick's last years were embittered 
by the hostilities following on the crusade which the pope pro- 
claimed against him and by rebellions in Naples and Sicily. 
He died in 1250. His policy was anti-feudal and fended to 
concentrate power into his own hands; hence the frequent 
risings of the barons. His court at Palermo had been pne of the 
most brilliant in Europe, and attracted learned men from all 
over the then known world; his somewhat pagan philosophy 
was afterwards regarded as marking the beginnings of modern 
rationalism. He opened schools and universities, and he himself 
wrote poetry in Sicilian dialect. 

His son Conrad IV. succeeded to the empire, while to his 
illegitimate son Manfred he left the principality of Taranto 
Manfred an ^ ^ e re S encv °f tne southern kingdom, to be held 
in. Conrad's name. By his political sagacity and 
moderation Manfred won a strong party to his side and helped 
Conrad to subjugate the rebellious barons. The emperor died in 
1254, leaving an infant son, Conradin(b. 1252), and Manfred was 
appointed vicar-general during the latter's minority. Manfred, 
too, encountered the hostility of the popes, against whom he had 
to wage war, generally with success, and of some of the barons 
whom the papacy encouraged to rebel; and in 1258, on a rumour 
of Conradin's death, he was offered and accepted the crown of 
Naples and Sicily. The rumour proved false, but he retained 
the crown, promising to leave the kingdom to Conradin at his 
death and to defend his rights. He now became head of 



the Ghibellines or Imperialists of Italy, and his position was 
strengthened by the marriage of his daughter Costanza to Peter, 
son of King James of Aragon. But he met with opposition from 
the turbulent nobility and the clergy, who had been deprived 
of many privileges, and he failed to conciliate the communes, 
which were oppressed by taxes and beginning to aspire to 
autonomy. Innocent IV., in his determination to crush the 
Hohenstaufens, offered the kingdom in turn to Richard, earl 
of Cornwall, to Edward, son of Henry III. of England, and to 
Charles of Anjou, brother of Louis IX. of France. After long 
negotiations jvith successive popes, Charles was finally induced 
by Clement IV. to come to Italy in 1265, agreeing to accept 
the kingdom of the Two Sicilies as a fief of the church, and 
in 1266 he marched southward with the privileges of Ch fe r 
a crusader (see Charles I., king of Naples and Sicily). 
The defection of many cities and nobles facilitated his task, 
and Manfred was forced to retire on Benevento, where, on the 
26th of February, owing to the treachery of a part of his troops, 
he was defeated and killed. As a result of this victory Charles 
was soon master of almost the whole kingdom, and he entered 
Naples, which now became the capital instead of Palermo. 
He persecuted the nobles who had sided with Manfred, and 
established a military despotism which proved more oppressive " 
than that of the Hohenstaufens had ever been. Old laws, 
customs 'and immunities were ruthlessly swept away, the people 
were ground down with taxes, and the highest positions and 
finest estates conferred on French and Provencal nobles. Al- 
though the southern Italians had long been ruled by foreigners, 
it was the Angevin domination which thoroughly denationalized 
them, and initiated that long period of corruption, decadence 
and foreign slavery which only ended in the 19th century. 

Invited by Sicilian malcontents and Ghibellines, Conradin 
(Ital. Corradino), the last surviving Hohenstaufen, descended 
into Italy in 1 267 at the head of a small army collected conradi 
in Germany, and he found many supporters; but 
King Charles on hearing of his arrival abandoned the siege 
of Lucera and came to intercept him. A battle took place 
at Tagliacozzo (August 23rd, 1268), in which the Imperialists 
were defeated, and Conradin himself was subsequently caught 
and handed over to Charles, who had him tried for high treason 
and beheaded (see Conradin). All who had assisted the un- 
fortunate youth were cruelly persecuted, and the inhabitants 
of Agosta put to the sword. Thus ended the power of the 
Hohenstaufens. Although the picturesque figures of Manfred 
and Conradin awakened sympathy among the people of the 
kingdom, their authority was never really consolidated and their 
German knights were hated; which facts rendered the enterprise 
of another foreigner like the Angevin comparatively easy. 

In Sicily, however, Charles's government soon made itself 
odious by its exactions, the insolence and cruelty of the king's 
French officials and favourites, the depreciation of 
the currency, and the oppressive personal services, Sicilian 
while the nobles were incensed at the violation of y cs pers* 
their feudal constitution. Just as Charles was con- 
templating an expedition to the East, the Sicilians rose in revolt, 
massacring the French throughout the island. The malcontents 
were led by the Salernitan noble Giovanni da Procida, a friend 
of the emperor Frederick and of Manfred, who had taken refuge 
at the court of Peter III. of Aragon, husband of Manfred's 
daughter Costanza. He had induced Peter to make good his 
somewhat shadowy claims to the crown of Sicily, but while 
preparations were being made for the expedition, the popular 
rising known as the Sicilian Vespers, which resulted in the mass- 
acre of nearly all the French in the island, broke out at Palermo 
on Easter Day 1282. Peter reached Palermo in September, 
and by the following month had captured Messina, the last 
French stronghold. Pope Martin IV. now proclaimed a crusade 
against the Aragonese, and the war continued for many years. 
The Sicilian fleet under Ruggiero di Lauria defeated that of 
the Angevins at Malta in 1283, and 1284 in the Bay of Naples, 
where the king's son, Charles the Lame, was captured. Charles I. 
died in 1286, and, his heir being a prisoner, his grandson, Charles

Martel (d. 1295), assumed the regency. Peter died the same 
year, leaving Aragon to his son Alphonso III. and Sicily to his 
son James, who was consecrated king in spite of the interdict. 
The war went on uninterruptedly, for the 'popes prevented all 
attempts to arrive at an understanding, as they were determined 
that the rights of the church should be fully recognized. Charles 
ch 1 u *k e Lame, who had been liberated in 1288, having 

renounced his rights on Sicily, was absolved from 
his oath by Pope Nicholas IV., who crowned him king of 
the Two Sicilies and excommunicated Alphonso. The latter's 
successor James made peace with Boniface VIII. by renouncing 
Sicily (in exchange for Sardinia and Corsica and the hand of 
Charles's daughter) and promising to help the Angevins to 
reconquer the island. But the Sicilians, led by James's brother, 

Frederick III., 1 who had been governor of the island 
IIt and was now proclaimed king, determined to resist. 

The war went on with varying success, until Charles 
of Valois, summoned by the pope to conduct the campaign, 
landed in Sicily and, his army being decimated by disease, 
made peace with Frederick at Caltabellotta (1302). The 
Angevins renounced Sicily in favour of Frederick, who was 
recognized as king of Trinacria (a name adopted so as not to 
mention that of Sicily), and he was to marry Leonora, daughter 
of Charles of Valois; at his death the island would revert to 
the Angevins, but his children would receive compensation else- 
where. In 1303 the pope unwillingly ratified the treaty. (Sec 
Charles II., king of Naples and Sicily, and Frederick III., 
king of Sicily.) 

Charles II. died in 1309 and was succeeded by his second son 
Robert. (His eldest son had predeceased him, leaving a son, 

Charles Robert, or Caroberto, at this time king of 

Hungary.) Robert now became leader of the Guelphs 
in Italy, and war between Naples and Sicily broke out once more, 
when Frederick allied himself with the emperor Henry VII. 
on his descent into Italy, and proclaimed his own son Peter 
heir to the throne. Robert led or sent many devastating expedi- 
tions into Sicily, and hostilities continued under King Peter 
even after Frederick's death in 1337. Peter died in 1342, leaving 
an infant son Louis; but just as Robert was preparing for 
another expedition he too diedjn the same year. Robert had 
been a capable ruler, a scholar and a friend of Petrarch, but he 
lost influence as a Guelph leader owing to the rise of other power- 
ful princes and republics, while in Naples itself his authority 
was limited by the rights of a turbulent and rebellious baronage 
(see Robert, king of Naples). His son Charles had died in 
1328 and he was succeeded by his granddaughter Joanna, 
wife of Andrew of Hungary, but the princes of the blood 
Joanna I. anc * ^ e Darons stirred up trouble, and in 1345 Andrew 

was assassinated by order of Catherine, widow of 
Philip, son of Charles II., and of several nobles, not without 
suspicion of Joanna's complicity. 

Andrew's brother Louis, king of Hungary, now came to Italy 
to make good his claims on Naples and avenge the murder of 
Andrew. With the help of some of the barons he drove Joanna 
and her second husband, Louis of Taranto, from the kingdom, 
and murdered Charles of Durazzo; but as Pope Clement refused 
to recognize his claims he went back to Hungary in 1348, and 
the fickle barons recalled Joanna, who returned and carried on 
desultory warfare with the partisans of Louis of Hungary. 
Louis of Taranto and Joanna were crowned at Naples by the 
pope's legate in 1352, but Niccolo Acciaiuoli, the seneschal, 
became the real master of the kingdom. In 1374 Joanna made 
peace with Frederick of Sicily, recognizing him as king of 
Trinacria on condition that he paid her tribute and recognized 
the pope's suzerainty. She nominated Louis of Anjou her 
heir, but while the latter was recognized by the antipope 
Clement VII,, Pope Urban VI. declared Charles of Durazzo 
(great-grandson of Charles II.) king of Sicily ol di qua del 
Faro {i.e. of Naples). Charles conquered the kingdom and took 
Joanna prisoner in 1381, and had her murdered the following

year. Louis, although assisted by Amadeus VI. of Savoy, failed 
to drive out Charles, and died in 1384. Charles III. died two 
years later and the kingdom was plunged into anarchy 
once more, part of the barons siding with his seven- ffi? HeS 
year-old son Ladislas, and part with Louis II. of 
Anjou. The latter was crowned by the antipope Clement, 
while Urban regarded both him and his rival as usurpers. On 
Urban 's death in 1389 Boniface IX. crowned Ladislas 
king of Naples, who by the year 1400 had expelled 
Louis and made himself master of the kingdom. In 1407 he 
occupied Rome, which Gregory XII. could not hold. But 
Alexander V., elected pope by the council of Pisa, turned against 
Ladislas and recognized Louis. Ladislas was defeated in 141 1 
and driven from Rome, but reoccupied the city on Louis's 
return to France. He died in 1414, and was succeeded by his 
sister Joanna II. {q.v.), during whose reign the kingdom , „ 

sank to the lowest depths of degradation. In 1415 
Joanna married James of Bourbon, who kept his wife in a state 
of semi-confinement, murdered her lover, Pandolfo Alopo, and 
imprisoned her chief captain, Sforza; but his arrogance drove 
the barons to rebellion, and they made him renounce the royal 
dignity and abandon the kingdom. The history of the next 
few years is a maze of intrigues between Joanna, Sforza, Giovanni 
Caracciolo, the queen's new lover, Alphonso of Aragon, whom 
she adopted as her heir, and Louis III. of Anjou, whom we find 
pitted against each other in every possible combination. Louis 
died in 1434 and Joanna in 1435 (see Joanna II., queen of Naples). 
The succession was disputed by Rene of Anjou and Alphonso, 
but the former eventually renounced his claims and Alphonso 
was recognized as king of Naples by Pope Eugenius IV. in 1443. 

Under Alphonso, surnamed "the Magnanimous," Sicily was 
once more united to Naples and a new era was inaugurated, for 
the king was at once a brilliant ruler, a scholar and 
a patron of letters. He died in 1458, leaving Naples ^£^i** 
to his illegitimate son Ferdinand I. (Don Ferrante), aaaimous. 
and Sicily, Sardinia and Aragon to his brother John. 
Ferdinand found, however, that Alphonso .had not really con- 
solidated his power, and he had practically to reconquer the 
whole country. By 1464 he was master of the situa- 
tion, in spite of the attempt of Pope Calixtus III. ; 
to enforce the claims of the papacy, and that of 
John of Anjou to enter into the heritage of^his ancestors. In 
alliance with Pope Sixtus IV. and the Milanese he waged war 
on Lorenzo de' Medici in 1479; but that astute ruler, by 
visiting Ferdinand in person, obtained peace on favourable 
terms (1479). In 1485 the disaffection of the barons, due to 
the king's harshness and the arrogance and cruelty of his son, 
found vent in a revolt led by Roberto Sanseverino and Francesco 
Coppola, which was crushed by means of craft and treachery. 
Ferdinand died in 1494 full of forebodings as to the probable 
effects of the invasion of Charles VIII. of France, and Tb€ 
was succeeded by Alphonso (see Ferdinand I., king of invasion 
Naples). The French king entered Italy in September of Charles 
1495, and conquered the Neapolitan kingdom without yuu 
much difficulty. Alphonso abdicated, his son Ferrandino and 
his brother Frederick withdrew to Ischia, and only a few towns 
in Apulia still held out for the Aragonese. But when the pope, 
the emperor, Spain and Venice, alarmed at Charles's progress, 
formed a defensive league against him, he quitted Naples, and 
Ferrandino, with the help of Ferdinand II. of Spain, was able 
to reoccupy his dominions. He died much regretted in 1496 
and was succeeded by Frederick. The country was torn by 
civil war and brigandage, and the French continued to press 
their claims; and although Louis XII. . (who had succeeded 
Charles VIII.) concluded a treaty with Ferdinand of Spain for 
the partition of Naples, France and Spain fell out in 1502 over 
the division of the spoi!s > and with Gonzalo de Cordoba's victory 
on the Garigliano in December 1502, the whole kingdom was 
in Spanish hands. 

On the death of Ferdinand in 151 6, the Habshurg Charles 
became king of Spain, and three years later was elected emperor 
as Charles V.; in 1522 he appointed John de Lannoy viceroy of

Naples, which became henceforth an integral part of the Spanish 
dominions. The old divisions of nobility, clergy and people were 
Na lesa maintained and their mutual rivalry encouraged; the 
Spanish nobles were won over by titles and by the splendour 
posses- of the viceregal court, but many persons of low birth 
slot*. w jj s howed talent were raised to high positions. 

The viceroy was assisted by the Collateral Council and the Sacred 
College of Santa Chiara, composed of Spanish and Italian 
members, and there was an armed force of the two nationalities. 
Spanish rule on the whole was oppressive and tyrannical, and 
based solely on the idea that the dependencies must pay tribute 
to the dominant kingdom. During the rule of Don Pedro de 
Toledo (one of the best viceroys) Naples became the centre of 
a Protestant movement which spread to the rest of Italy, but 
was ultimately crushed by the Inquisition. In Sicily Spanish 
rule was less absolute, for the island had not been conquered, 
but had given itself over voluntarily to the Aragonese; and the 
parliament, formed by the three bracci or orders (the militate 
consisting of the nobility, the ecclesiasticOj of the clergy, and the 
demaniale, of the communes), imposed certain limitations on 
the viceroy, who had to play off the three bracci against each 
other. But the oppressive character of the government provoked 
several rebellions. In 1598 an insurrection, headed 
by the philosopher Tommaso Campanella, broke out 
in Calabria, and was crushed with great severity. 
In 1647, during the viceroyalty of the marquis de Los Leres in 
Sicily, bread riots in Palermo became a veritable revolution, 
and the people, led by the goldsmith Giovanni d' Alessio, drove 
the viceroy from the city; but the nobles, fearing for their 
privileges, took the viceroy's part and turned the people against 
d' Alessio, who yas murdered, and Los Leres returned. On the 
7th of July 1647, tumults occurred at Naples in consequence of 
a new fruit tax, and the viceroy, Count d* Arcos, was forced 
to take refuge in the Castelnuovo. The populace, led by an 
Amalfi fisherman, known as Masaniello (?.tf.), obtained 
arms, erected barricades, and, while professing loyalty 
to the king of Spain, demanded the removal of the oppressive 
taxes and murdered many of the nobles. D' Arcos came to terms 
with Masaniello; but in spite of this, and of the assassination 
of Masaniello, whose arrogance and ferocity had made him 
unpopular, the disturbances continued, and again the viceroy 
had to retire to Castelnuovo and make concessions. Even the 
arrival of reinforcements from Spain failed to restore order, and 
the new popular leader, Gennaro Annese, now sought assistance 
from the French, and invited the duke of Guise to come to Naples. 
The duke came with some "soldiers and ships; but failed to effect 
anything; and after the recall of d 7 Arcos the new viceroy, 
Count d'Ognate, having come to an arrangement with Annese 
and got Guise out of the city, proceeded to punish all who had 
taken part in the disturbances, and had Annese and a number 
of others beheaded. 

In 1670 disorders broke out at Messina. They began with a 
riot between the nobles and the burghers, but ended in an anti- 
Spanish movement; and while the inhabitants called 
vofuUoaat * n t ^ ae French, the Spaniards, who could not crush the 
Messiaa, rising, called in the Dutch. Louis XIV. sent a fleet 
under the due de Vivonne to Sicily, which defeated 
the Dutch under de Ruyter in 1676. But at the peace of 
Nijmwegen (1679) Louis treacherously abandoned the Mcssinese,' 
who suffered cruel persecution at the hands of the Spaniards 
and lost all their privileges. An anti-Spanish conspiracy of 
Neapolitan nobles, led by Macchia, with the object of proclaiming 
the archduke Charles of Austria king of Naples, was discovered; 
but in 1707 an Austrian army conquered the kingdom, and 
Spanish rule came to an end after 203 years, during which it had 
succeeded in thoroughly demoralizing the people. 
In Sicily the Spaniards held their own until the peace of 
Utrecht in 1713, when the island was given over to Duke 
undfr Victor of Savoy, who assumed the title of king. In 
Savoy, r 7!8 he had to hand back his new possession to 
Spain, who, in 1720, surrendered it to Austria and gave 
Sardinia to Victor Amadeus. In 1733 the treaty of the Escurial 



Charles 
ill. 



between France, Spain and Savoy against Austria was signed. 
Don Carlos of Bourbon, son of Philip V. of Spain, easily conquered 
both Naples and Sicily, and in 1738 he was recognized as king 
of the Two Sicilies, Spain renouncing all her claims. 
Charles was well received, for the country now was an 
independent kingdom once more. With the Tuscan 
Bernardo Tanucci as his minister, he introduced many useful 
reforms, improved the army, which was thus able to repel an 
Austrian invasion in 1744, embellished the city of Naples and 
built roads. In 1759 Charles III., having succeeded to the 
Spanish crown, abdicated that of the Two Sicilies in favour of his 
son Ferdinand, who became Ferdinand IV. of Naples and III. 
of Sicily. Being only eight years old, a regency under Tanucci 
was appointed, and the young king's education was 
purposely neglected by the minister, who wished to /K# 
dominate him completely. The regency ended in 1767, 
and the following year Ferdinand married the masterful and 
ambitious Maria Carolina, daughter of the empress Maria Theresa. 
She had Tanucci dismissed and set herself to the task of making 
Naples a great power. With the help of John Acton, an English- 
man whom she made minister in the place of Tanucci, she freed 
Naples from Spanish influence and secured a rapprochement 
with England and Austria. 

On the outbreak of the French Revolution the king and queen 
were not at first hostile to the new movement; but after the 
fall of the French monarchy they became violently opposed to 
it, and in 1793 joined the first coalition against France, instituting 
severe persecutions against all who were remotely suspected of 
French sympathies. Republicanism, however, gained ground, 
especially among the aristocracy. ^ In 1796 peace with France 
was concluded, but in 1798, during Napoleon's absence in Egypt 
and after Nelson's victory at Aboukir, Maria Carolina induced 
Ferdinand to go to war with France once more. Nelson arrived 
in Naples in September, where he was enthusiastically received. 
The king, after a somewhat farcical occupation of Rome, which 
had been evacuated by the French, hurried back to Naples as 
soon as the French attacked his troops, and although the lazzaroni 
(the lowest class of the people) were devoted to the dynasty 
and ready to defend it, he fled with the court to Palermo in a 
panic on board Nelson's ships. The wildest confusion prevailed, 
and the lazzaroni jnassacred numbers of persons suspected of 
republican sympathies, while the nobility and the educated 
classes, finding themselves abandoned by their king in this 
cowardly manner, began to contemplate a republic under French 
auspices as their only means of salvation from anarchy. In 
January 1799 the French under Championnet reached 
Naples, but the lazzaroni, ill-armed and ill-disciplined ^* cA /a 
as they were, ' resisted the enemy with desperate ^ ap i es 
courage, and it was not until the 20th that the invaders aad the 
were masters of the city. On the 23rd the Partheno- Parthcno- 
paean republic was proclaimed. The Republicans were ^J/J//^ 
men of culture and high character, but doctrinaire and 
unpractical, and they knew very little of the lower classes of 
their own country. The government soon found itself in financial 
difficulties, owing to Championnet's demands for money; it 
failed to organize the army, and met with scant success in its 
attempts to "democratize " the provinces. Meanwhile the court 
at Palermo sent Cardinal Fabrizio Ruffo, a wealthy 
and influential prelate, to Calabria, to organize a Ruffo 
counter-revolution. He succeeded beyond expectation, aad the 
and with his " Christian army of the Holy Faith " s *°' 
(Esercito Cristiano della Santa Fede), consisting of 
brigands, convicts, peasants and some soldiers, marched through 
the kingdom plundering, burning and massacring. An English 
squadron approached Naples and occupied the island of Procida, 
but after a few engagements with the Republican fleet com- 
manded by Caracciolo, an ex-officer in the Bourbon navy, it was 
recalled to Palermo, as the Franco-Spanish fleet was expected. 
Ruffo, with the addition of some Russian and Turkish allies, 
now marched on the capital, whence the French, save for a 
small force under Mejean, withdrew. The scattered Republican 
detachments were defeated, only Naples and Pescara holding

out. On the 13th of June Ruffo and his hordes reached Naples, 
and after a desperate battle at the Ponte deila Maddalena, 
entered the city. For weeks the Calabresi and lozzarani continued 
to pillage and massacre, and Ruffo was unable, even if willing, 
to restrain them. But the Royalists were not masters of the city, 
for the French in Castel Sant* Elmo and the Republicans in 
Castelnuovo and Castel dell' Uovo still held out and bombarded 
the streets, while the Franco-Spanish fleet might arrive at any 
moment. Consequently Ruffo was desperately anxious to come 
to terms with the Republicans for the evacuation of the castles, 
in spite of the queen's orders to make no terms with the rebels. 
After some negotiation an armistice was concluded and a capitu- 
lation agreed upon, whereby the castles were to be evacuated, 
the hostages liberated and the garrisons free to remain in Naples 
unmolested or to sail for Toulon. 

While the vessels were being prepared for the voyage to 
Toulon all the hostages in the castles were liberated save four; 
but on the 24th of June Nelson arrived with his fleet, 
and on hearing of the capitulation he refused to 
recognize it save in so far as it concerned the French. 
Ruffo indignantly declared that once the treaty was signed, 
not only by himself but by the Russian and Turkish commandants 
and by the British captain Foote, it must be respected, and on 
Nelson's refusal he said that he would not help him to capture 
the castles. On the 26th Nelson changed his attitude and 
authorized Sir William Hamilton, the British minister, to inform 
the cardinal that he (Nelson) would do nothing to break the 
armistice; while Captains Bell and Troubridge wrote that they 
had Nelson's authority to state that the latter would not oppose 
the embarcation of the Republicans. Although these expressions 
were equivocal, the Republicans were satisfied and embarked 
on the vessels prepared for them. But on the 28th Nelson 
received despatches from the court (in reply to his own), in conse- 
quence of which he had the vessels brought under the guns of his 
ships, and many of the Republicans were arrested. Caracciolo, 
who had been caught whilst attempting to escape from Naples, 
was tried by a court-martial of Royalist ofl&cers under Nelson's 
auspices on board the admiral's flagship, condemned to death 
and hanged at the yard arm. For the part played by Nelson 
in these transactions see the articles Caracciolo and Nelson. 
On the 8th of July, King Ferdinand arrived from Palermo, 
and the state trials, conducted in the most arbitrary fashion, 
resulted in wholesale butchery; hundreds of persons 
vengeance. were executed, including some of the best men in the 
* country, such as the philosopher Mario Pagano. the 
scientist Cirillo, Manthone, the minister of war under the re- 
public, Massa, the defender of Castel dell' Uovo, and Ettore 
Caraffa, the defender of Pescara, who had been captured by 
treachery, while thousands of others were immured in horrible 
dungeons or exiled. 

War with France continued until March 1801, when peace 
was made, and after the peace of Amiens in 1802 the court 
returned to Naples, where it was well received. But when the 
European war broke out again in the following year, Napoleon 
(then first consul) became very exacting in his demands on 
King Ferdinand, who consequently played a double game, 
appearing to accede to these demands while negotiating with 
England. After Austerlitz Napoleon revenged himself by de- 
claring that " the Bourbon dynasty had ceased to reign," and 
sent an army under his brother Joseph to occupy the kingdom. 

Ferdinand and Maria Carolina fled to Palermo in January 
1805; in February 1806 Joseph Bonaparte entered Naples 
as king. A cultivated, well-meaning, not very in- 
Bonaparte. telligent man, he introduced many useful reforms on 
a basis of benevolent despotism, abolished feudalism 
and built roads, but the taxes and forced contributions which 
he levied proved very burdensome. Joseph's authority did not 
exist throughout a large part of the kingdom, where royalist 
risings, led by brigand chiefs, maintained a state of anarchy, 
and a British force under Sir John Stuart, which landed in 
Calabria from Sicily, defeated the French at Maida (July 6th, 
1806). Both the French and the royalists committed atrocities, 



and many conspirators in Naples were tried by the French 
state courts and shot. 

In 1808 Napoleon conferred the crown of Spain on Joseph, 
and appointed Joachim Murat king of Naples. Murat continued 
Joseph's reforms, swept away many old abuses and 
reorganized the army; and although he introduced Mural™ 
the French codes and conferred many appointments 
and estates on Frenchmen, his administration was more or less 
native, and he favoured the abler Neapolitans. His attempts 
to attack the English in Sicily ended disastrously, but he succeeded 
in crushing brigandage in Calabria by means of General Manhes, 
who, however, had to resort to methods of ferocity in order to 
do so. The king, owing to his charm of manner, his handsome 
face, and his brilliant personality, gained many sympathies, 
and began to aspire to absolute independence. He gradually 
became estranged from Napoleon, and although he followed 
him to Russia and afterwards took part in the German campaign, 
he secretly opened negotiations with Austria and Great Britain. 
In January 1814 he signed a treaty with Austria, each power 
guaranteeing the dominions of the other, while Sicily was to 
be left to Ferdinand. The following month he proclaimed 
his separation from Napoleon and marched against Eugene 
Beauharnais, the French viceroy of Lombardy. But no important 
engagements took place, and when Napoleon escaped from Elba, 
Murat suddenly returned to the allegiance of his old chief. He 
marched at the head of 35,000 men into northern Italy, and 
from Rimini issued his famous proclamation in favour of Italian 
independence, which at the time fell on deaf ears (March 30th, 
1815). He was subsequently defeated by the Austrians several 
times and forced to retreat, and on the 18th of May he sailed from 
Naples for France (see Murat, Joachim). Generals Guglielmo 
Pepe and Carrascosa now concluded a treaty with the Austrians 
at Casalanza on favourable terms, and on the 23rd the Austrians 
entered Naples to restore Bourbon rule. 

Ferdinand and Maria Carolina had continued to reign in Sicily, 
where the extravagance of the court and the odious Neapolitan 
system ' of police espionage rendered' their presence 
a burden instead of a blessing to the island. The king Q e ur fy 0ns 
obtained a subsidy from Great Britain and allowed in Sicily. 
British troops to occupy Messina and Agosta, so that 
they might operate against the French on the mainland. A 
bitter conflict broke out between the court and the parliament, 
and the British minister, Lord William Bentinck, favoured the 
opposition, forced Ferdinand to resign his authority and appoint 
his son regent and introduced many valuable reforms. The 
queen perpetually intrigued against Bentinck, and The 
even negotiated with the French, but in 181 2 a more English 
liberal constitution on British lines was introduced, and c t ^ iIiu ' 
a Liberal ministry under the princes of Castelnuovo 
and Belmonte appointed, while the queen was exiled in the 
following year. But after the fall of Napoleon Sicily ceased to 
have any importance for Great Britain, and Bentinck, whose 
memory is still cherished in the island, departed in 1814. 
Ferdinand succeeded in getting a reactionary ministry appointed, 
and dissolved parliament in May 1815, after concluding a treaty 
with Austria — now freed by Murat's defection from her engage- 
ments with him — for the recovery of his mainland dominions 
by means of an Austrian army paid for by himself. On the 
oth of June Ferdinand re-entered Naples and bound ike 
himself in a second treaty with Austria not to introduce restora- 
a constitutional government; 1 but at first he abstained iJ OD i£ /T 
from persecution and received many of Murat's old 
officers into his army in accordance with the treaty of Casalanza. 
In October 1815 Murat, believing that he still had a strong 
party in the kingdom, landed with a few companions at Pizzo 

1 The secret article of the treaty of June 12, 1815, runs as follows: 
11 H.M. the King of the Two Sicilies, in re-establishing the govern- 
ment of the kingdom, will not agree to any changes irreconcilable 
either with the ancient institutions of the monarchy or with the 
principles adopted by H.I. and R. Austrian Majesty for the internal 
regime of his Italian provinces." It is to be noted that this did not 
involve the obligation of interfering with the ancient constitution of 
Sicily, which Metternich desired to see remain undisturbed. 



NAPLES, KINGDOM OF

di Calabria, but was immediately captured by the police and the 
peasantry, court-martialled and shot. 

Ferdinand to some extent maintained French legislation, 
but otherwise reorganized the state with Metternich's approval 
on Bourbon lines; he proclaimed himself king of the Two Sicilies 
at the congress of Vienna, incorporating Naples and Sicily into 
one state, and abolished the Sicilian constitution (December 
1816). In 1818 he concluded a Concordat with the Church, 
by which the latter renounced its suzerainty over the kingdom, 
but was given control over education, the censorship and many 
other privileges. But there was much disaffection throughout 

the country, and the Carbonarist lodges, founded in 
The Murat's time with the object of freeing the country 

of 1820. from foreign rule and obtaining a constitution, had 

•made much progress (see Carbonari). The army 
indeed was honeycombed with Carbonari, and General Pepe, 
himself a member of the society, organized them on a military 
basis. In July 1820 a military mutiny broke out at Caserta, 
led by two officers and a priest, the mutineers demanding a 
constitution although professing loyalty to the king. Ferdinand, 
feeling himself helpless to resist, acceded to the demand, appointed 
a ministry composed of Murat's old adherents, and entrusted 
his authority to his son. The ultra-democratic single-chamber 
Spanish constitution of 1812 was introduced, but proved utterly 
unworkable. The new government's first difficulty was Sicily, 
where the people had risen in rebellion demanding their own 
charter of 1812, and although the Neapolitan troops quelled 
the outbreak with much bloodshed the division proved fatal 
to the prospects of'ttberty. 

The outbreak of the military rising in Naples, following so 
shortly on that in Spain, seriously alarmed the powers responsible 
for the preservation of the peace in Europe. The position was 
complicated by the somewhat enigmatic attitude of Russia; 
for the Neapolitan Liberals, with many of whom Count Capo 
d' Istria, the Russian minister of foreign affairs, had been on 
friendly terms, proclaimed that they had the " moral support " 
of the tsar. This idea, above all, it was necessary for Austria 
to destroy once for all. The diplomatic negotiations are discussed 
in the article on the history of Europe (q.v.). Here it suffices to 
say that these issued in the congress of Troppau (October 1820) 
and the proclamation of the famous Troppau protocol affirming 
the right of collective/' Europe " to interfere to crush dangerous 
internal revolutions. Both France and Great Britain protested 
against the general principle laid down in this instrument; but 
neither of them approved of the Neapolitan revolution, and 
neither of them was opposed to an intervention in Naples, 
provided this were carried out, not on the ground of a supposed 
right of Europe to interfere, but by Austria for Austrian ends. 
By general consent King Ferdinand was invited to attend the 
adjourned congress, fixed to meet at Laibach in the spring of 
the following year. Under the new constitution, the permission 
of parliament was necessary before the king could leave Neapolitan 
territory; but this was weakly granted, after Ferdinand had 
sworn the most solemn oaths to maintain the constitution. He 
was scarcely beyond the frontiers, however, before he repudiated 
his engagements, as exacted by force. A cynicism so unblushing 
shocked even the seasoned diplomats of the congress, who would 
have preferred that the king should have made a decent show 
of yielding to force. The result was, however, that the powers 
authorized Austria to march an army into Naples to restore 
the autocratic monarchy. This decision was notified to the 
Neapolitan government by Russia, Prussia and Austria — Great 
Britain and France maintaining a strict neutrality. Meanwhile 
the regent, in spite of his declaration that he would lead the 
Neapolitan army against the invader, was secretly undermining 
the position of the government, and there were divisions of opinion 

in the ranks of the Liberals themselves. General Pepe 
Austrians was sent t0 t ^ ie lront i er at tne nea ^ of 8000 men, but 
la Naples. wa s completely defeated by the Austrians at Rieti 

on the 7th of March. On the 23rd the Austrians 
entered Naples, followed soon afterwards by the king; every 
vestige of freedom was suppressed, the reactionary Medici 



ministry appointed, and the inevitable state trials instituted 
with the usual harvest of executions and imprisonment. Pepe 
saved himself by flight. (See Ferdinand IV., king of Naples.) 

Ferdinand died in 1825, and his son and successor, Francis I., 
an unbridled libertine, at once threw off the mask of Liberalism; 
the corruption of the administration under Medici 
assumed unheard-of proportions, and every office was 
openly sold. The Austrian occupation lasted until 1827, having 
cost the state 310,000,000 lire; but in the meanwhile the 
Swiss Guard had been established as a further protection for 
autocracy, and the revolutionary outbreak at Bosco on the 
Cilento was suppressed with the usual cruelty. (See Francis 
I., king of the Two Sicilies.) 

Francis died in 1830 and was succeeded by his son, Ferdinand 
II., who at first awoke hopes that the conditions of the country 
would be improved. He was not devoid of good 
qualities, and took an interest in the material welfare w< 
of the country, but he was narrow-minded, ignorant 
and bigoted; he made the administration more efficient, and re- 
organized the army which became purged of Carbonarism, and 
such Carbonarist plots as there were in the 'thirties were not 
severely punished. Ferdinand was impatient of Austrian in- 
fluence, but on the death of his first wife, Cristina of Savoy, he 
married Maria Theresa of Austria, who encouraged him in his 
reactionary tendencies and brought him closer to Austria. An 
outbreak of cholera in 1837 led to disorders in Sicily, which, 
having assumed a political character, were repressed by Del 
Caretto with great severity. The government tended to become 
more and more autocratic and to rely wholly on the all-powerful 
police, the spies and the priests; and, although the king showed 
some independence in foreign affairs, his popularity waned; the 
desire for a constitution was by no means dead, and the survivors 
of the old Carbonari gathered round Carlo Poerio, while the 
Giovane Italia society (independent of Mazzini), led by Benedetto 
Musolino, took as its motto " Unity, Liberty and Independence." 
But as yet the idea of unity made but little headway, for southern 
Italy was too widely separated by geographical conditions, 
history, tradition and custom from the rest of the peninsula, 
and the majority of the Liberals — themselves a minority of the 
population — merely aspired to a constitutional Neapolitan 
monarchy, possibly forming part of a confederation of Italian 
states. The attempt of the Giovane Italia to bring about a 
general revolution in 1843 only resulted in a few sporadic out- 
breaks easily crushed. The following year the Venetian brothers 
Bandiera/ acting in concert with Mazzini, landed in 
Calabria, believing the whole country to be in a state Z he ., 
of revolt; they met with little local support and were attempt! 
quickly captured and shot, but their death aroused 
much sympathy, and the whole episode was highly significant 
as being the first attempt made by north Italians to promote 
revolution in the south. In 1847 a pamphlet by L. Settembrini, 
entitled " A Protest of the People of the Two Sicilies/* appeared 
anonymously and created a deep impression as a most scathing 
indictment of the government; and at the same time the 
election of Pius IX., a pope who was believed to be a Liberal, 
caused widespread excitement throughout Italy. Conspiracy 
was now rife both in Naples and Sicily, but as yet there was no 
idea of deposing the king. Many persons were arrested, including 
Carlo Poerio, who, however, continued to direct the agitation. 

On the 12th of January 1848 a revolution under the leadership 
of Ruggiero Settimo broke out at Palermo to the cry of " in- 
dependence or the 181 2 constitution," and by the end 
of February the whole island, with the exception of The 
Messina, was in the hands of the revolutionists. These ^ sictly. 
events were followed by demonstrations at Naples; 
the king summoned a meeting of generals and members of his 
family on the 27th of January, and on the advice of Filangieri 
{q.v.), who said that the army was not to be relied upon, he 
dismissed the Pietracatella ministry and Del Caretto, and 
summoned the duke of Serracapriola to form another administra- 
tion. On the 28th he granted the constitution, and the Liberals 
Bozzelli and Carlo Poerio afterwards joined the cabinet. The 



i88 



NAPLES, KINGDOM OF 



popular demand was now that Naples should assist the Lombards 
in their revolt against Austria, for a feeling of Italian solidarity 
The was growing up. The ministry of Carlo Troya suc- 

constitu- ceeded to that of Serracapriola, and after the parlia- 
tionof mentary elections, in which many extreme Radicals 
!848t were elected, Ferdinand declared war against Austria 

(April 7th, 1848). After considerable delay a Neapolitan army 
under General Pepe marched towards Lombardy in May, while 
the fleet sailed for Venice. But a dispute between the king and 
the parliament concerning the form of the royal oath having 
arisen, a group of demagogues with criminal folly provoked 
disturbances and erected barricades (May 14th). The king 
refused to open parliament unless the barricades were removed, 
and while the moderate elements attempted to bring about 
conciliation, the ministry acted with great weakness. A few 

shots were fired — it is not known who fired first — on 
of May. the 15th, the Swiss regiments stormed the barricades 

and street fighting lasted all day. By the evening the 
Swiss and the royalists were masters of the situation. A new 
ministry under Prince Cariati was appointed. Parliament was 
dissolved, the National Guard disbanded and the army recalled 
from the Po. Fresh elections were held and the new parliament 
met on the 15th of July, but it had the king, the army and the 
mob against it, and anti-constitutionalist demonstrations became 
frequent. After a brief session it was prorogued to the 1st of 
February 1849, and when it met on that date a deadlock between 
king and parliament occurred. The Austrian victories in Lom- 
bardy had strengthened the court party, or Camarilla as it was 
called, and on the 13th of March the assembly was again dissolved, 
and never summoned again. The king was at Gaeta, whither 
the grand-duke of Tuscany and Pius IX. had also repaired to 
escape from their rebellious subjects, and the city became the 
headquarters of Italian reaction. 

In Sicily the revolutionists were purely insular in their aspira- 
tions and bitterly hostile to the Neapolitans, and the attempts 

at conciliation, although favoured by Lord Minto, 

failed, for Naples wanted one constitution and one 
parliament, whereas Sicily wanted two, with only the king in 
common. The Sicilian assembly met in March 1848, and Settimo 
in his inaugural speech declared that the Bourbon dynasty had 
ceased to reign, that the throne was vacant and that Sicily united 
her destinies to those of Italy. Settimo was elected president of 
the government, but the administration was lacking in states- 
manship, the treasury was empty, and nothing was done to raise 
an army. After the Austrian victories King Ferdinand sent a 
Neapolitan army of 20,000 men under Filangieri to subjugate 
the island. The troops landed at Messina, of which the citadel 
had been held by the royalists throughout, and after three days' 
desperate fighting the city itself was captured and sacked. 
The British and French admirals imposed a truce with a view to 
conciliation, and the king offered the Sicilians the Neapolitan 
constitution and a separate parliament, which they refused. 
Sicilian troops were now levied throughout the island and the 
chief command given to the Pole Mieroslawski, but it was too 
late. Filangieri marched forward taking town after town, and 
committing many atrocities. In April he reached Palermo while 
the fleet appeared in the bay; tumults having broken out within 
the city, the government surrendered on terms which granted 
amnesty for all except Settimo and forty-two others. 

For a few months after the dissolution of the Neapolitan 
parliament the government abstained from persecution, but 

with the crushing of the Sicilian revolution its hands 
Neapolitan were ^ ree J an ^ when the commission on the affair of 
prisons. the 15th of May had completed its labours the state 

trials and arrests began. The arrest of S. Fauci tano 
for a demonstration at Gaeta led to the discovery of the Unild 
Italiana society, whose object was to free Italy from domestic 
tyranny and foreign domination. Thousands of respectable 
citizens were thrown into prison, such as L. Settembrini, Carlo 
Poerio and Silvio Spaventa. The trials were conducted with the 
most scandalous contempt of justice, and moral and physical 
torture was applied to extort confessions. The abominable con- 



Siclty. 



ditions of the prisons in which the best men of the kingdom were 
immured, linked to the vilest common criminals, was made 
known to the world by the famous letters of W. E. Gladstone, 
which branded the Bourbon regime as " the negation of God 
erected into a system of government." The merest suspicion of 
unorthodox opinions, the possession of foreign newspapers, the 
wearing of a beard or an anonymous denunciation, sufficed for 
the arrest and condemnation of a man to years of imprisonment, 
while the altendibili, or persons under police surveillance liable 
to imprisonment without trial at any moment, numbered 50,000. 
The remonstrances of Great Britain and France met with no 
success. Ferdinand strongly resented foreign interference, and 
even rejected the Austrian proposal for a league of the Italian 
despots for mutual defence against external attacks and internal 
disorder. In 1856 his life was unsuccessfully attempted by a 
soldier, and the same year Baron Bentivegna organized a revolt 
near Palermo, which was quickly suppressed. In 1857 Carlo 
Pisacane, an ex-Neapolitan officer who had taken part t 

in the defence of Rome, fitted out an expedition, with a ttcmpt * 
Mazzini's approval, from Genoa, and landed at Sapri 
in Calabria, where he hoped to raise the flag of revolution; but 
the local police assisted by the peasantry attacked the band, 
killing many, including Pisacane himself, and capturing most of 
the rest. The following year, at the instance of Great Britain 
and France, Ferdinand commuted the sentences of some of the 
political prisoners to exile. (See Ferdinand II., king of the Two 
Sicilies). 

In May 1859 Ferdinand died, and was succeeded by his son, 
Francis II., who came to the throne just as the Franco-Sardinian 
victories in Lombardy were sounding the death-knell FrancIsII 
of Austrian predominance and domestic despotism in 
Italy (see Italy: History). But although there was much 
activity and plotting among the Liberals, there was as yet no 
revolution. Victor Emmanuel, king of Sardinia, wrote to the 
new king proposing an alliance for the division of Italy, but 
Francis refused. In June part of the Swiss Guard mutinied 
because the Bernese government not having renewed the conven- 
tion with Naples the troops were deprived of their cantonal flag. 
The mutinous regiments, however, were surrounded by loyal 
troops and shot down; and this affair resulted in the disbanding 
of the whole force — the last support of the autocracy. Political 
amnesties were now decreed, and in September 1859 Filangieri was 
made prime minister. The latter favoured the Sardinian alliance 
and the.granting of the constitution, and so did the king's uncle, 
Leopold, count of Syracuse. But Francis rejected both proposals 
and Filangieri resigned and was succeeded by A. Statella. In 
April i860 Victor Emmanuel again proposed an alliance whereby 
Naples, in return for help in expelling the Austrians from 
Venetia, was to receive the Marche, while Sardinia would annex 
all the rest of Italy except Rome. But Francis again refused, 
and in fact was negotiating with Austria and the pope for a 
simultaneous invasion of Modena, Lombardy and Romagna. 

In the meantime, however, events in Sicily were reaching a 
crisis destined to subvert the Bourbon dynasty. The Sicilians, 
unlike the Neapolitans, were thoroughly alienated from 
the Bourbons, whom they detested, and after the ^thf' 
peace of Villafranca (July 1859) Mazzini's emissaries, Thousand. 
F. Crispi and R. Pilo, had been trying to organize a 
rising in favour of Italian unity; and although they merely 
succeeded in raising a few squadre, or armed bands, in the 
mountainous districts, they persuaded Garibaldi (q.v.), without 
the magic of whose personal prestige they knew nothing im- 
portant could be achieved, that the revolution which he knew 
to be imminent had broken out. The authorities at Palermo, 
learning of a projected rising, attacked the convent of La Gangia, 
the headquarters of the rebels, and killed most of the inmates; 
but in the meanwhile Garibaldi, whose hesitation had been 
overcome, embarked on the 5th of May i860, at Quarto, near 
Genoa, with 1000 picked followers on board two steamers, and 
sailed for Sicily. On the nth the expedition reached Marsala 
and landed without opposition. Garibaldi was somewhat coldly 
received by the astonished population; but he set forth at once for 



NAPLES, KINGDOM OF 



189 



Salemi, whence he issued a proclamation assuming the dictator- 
ship of Sicily in the name of Victor Emmanuel, with Crispi as 
secretary of state. He continued his march towards Palermo, 
where the bulk of the 30,000 Bourbon troops were concentrated, 
gathering numerous followers on the way. On the 15th he 
attacked and defeated 3000 of the enemy under General Landi 
at Calatafimi; the news of this brilliant victory revived the 
revolutionary agitation throughout the island, and Garibaldi 
was joined by Pilo and his bands. By a cleverly devised ruse he 
avoided General Colonna's force, which expected him on the 
„ . Monreale road, and entering Palermo from Misilmeri 

received an enthusiastic welcome. The Bourbonists, 
although they bombarded the city from the citadel and the 
warships in the harbour, gradually lost ground, and after three 
days' street fighting their commander, General Lanza, not 
knowing that the Garibaldians had scarcely a cartridge left, 
asked for arid obtained a twenty-four hours' armistice (May 30th). 
Garibaldi went on board the British flagship to confer with the 
Neapolitan generals Letizia and Chretien; Letizia's proposal 
that the municipality should make a humble petition to the 
king was indignantly rejected by Garibaldi, who merely agreed 
to the extension of the armistice until next day. Then he 
informed the citizens by means of a proclamation of what he had 
done, and declared that, knowing them to be ready to die in the 
ruins of their city, he would renew hostilities on the expiration 
of the armistice. Although unarmed, the people rallied to him 
as one man, and Lanza became so alarmed that he asked for 
an unconditional extension of the armistice, which "Garibaldi 
granted. The dictator now had time to collect ammunition, and 
the Neapolitan government having given Lanza full powers to 
treat with him, 15,000 Bourbon troops embarked for Naples on 
the 7th of June, leaving the revolutionists masters of the situation. 
The Sardinian Admiral Persano's salute of nineteen guns on the 
occasion of Garibaldi's official call constituted a practical recogni- 
tion of his dictatorship by the Sardinian (Piedmontese) govern- 
ment. In July further reinforcements of volunteers under Cosenz 
and Medici, assisted by Cavour, arrived at Palermo with a good 
supply of arms furnished by subscription in northern Italy. Gari- 
baldi's forces were now raised to 12,000 men, besides the Sicilian 
squadre. Cavour's attempt to bring about the annexation of 
Sicily to Sardinia failed, for Garibaldi wished to use the island as 
a basis for an invasion of the mainland. Most of the island had 
now been evacuated by the Bourbonists, but Messina and a few 
other points still held out, and when the Garibaldians advanced 
eastward they encountered a force of 4000 of the enemy under 
Colonel Bosco at Milazzo; on the 20th of July a desperate 
battle took place resulting in a hard-won Garibaldian victory. 
The Neapolitan government then decided on the evacuation of 

(the whole of Sicily except the citadel of Messina, which did not 
surrender until the following year. 
The news of Garibaldi's astonishing successes entirely changed 
the situation in the capital, and on the 25th of June i860 the 
The king, after consulting the ministers and the royal 

Neapolitan family, granted a constitution, and appointed A. 
constitu- Spinelli prime minister. Disorders having taken 

» place between Liberals and reactionaries, Liberio 

Romano was made minister of police in the place of Aiossa. 
Sicily being lost, the king directed all his efforts to save Naples; 
he appealed to Great Britain and France to prevent Garibaldi 

(from crossing the Straits of Messina, and only just failed (for this 
episode see under Lacaita, G.). Victor Emmanuel himself 
wrote to Garibaldi urging him to abstain from an attack on 
Naples, but Garibaldi refused to obey, and on the 19th of August 
he crossed with 4500 men and took Reggio by storm. He was 
soon joined by the rest of his troops, 15,000 in all, and although 
the Neapolitan government had 30,000 men in Calabria alone, the 
army collapsed before Garibaldi's advance, and the 
on'tht^ P eo P le rose * n ms favour almost everywhere. Francis 
mainland, offered Garihaldi a large sum of money if he would 
abstain from advancing farther, and 50,000 men to 
fight the Austrians and the pope; but it was too late, and on the 
6th of September the king and queen sailed for Gaeta. The 



40,000 Bourbon troops between Salerno and Avellino fell back 
panic-stricken, and on the 7th Garibaldi entered Naples alone, 
although the city was still full of soldiers, and was received with 
delirious enthusiasm. On the nth a part of the royalists 
capitulated and the rest retired on Capua. Cavour now decided 
that Sardinia must take part in the liberation of southern Italy, 
for he feared that Garibaldi's followers might induce him to 
proclaim the republic and attack Rome, which would have 
provoked French hostility; consequently a Piedmontese army 
occupied the Marche and Umbria, and entered Neapolitan 
territory with Victor Emmanuel at its head. On the 1st and 2nd 
of October i860 a battle was fought on the Volturno victor 
between 20,000 Garibaldians, many of them raw Emmanuel 
levies, and 35,000 Bourbon troops, and although at *" rf 
first a Garibaldian division under Tiirr was repulsed, aaHbatdL 
Garibaldi himself arrived in time to turn defeat into victory. 
On the 26th he met Victor Emmanuel at Teano and hailed him 
king of Italy, and subsequently handed over his conquests to 
him. On the 3rd of November a plebiscite was taken, which 
resulted in an overwhelming majority in favour of union with 
Sardinia under Victor Emmanuel. Garibaldi departed for his 
island home at Caprera, while L.C. Farini was appointed viceroy 
of Naples and M. Cordero viceroy of Sicily. The last remnant of 
the Bourbon army was concentrated at Gaeta, the siege of which 
was begun by Cialdinion the 5th of November; on the 
10th of January 1861 the French fleet, which Napoleon G& \^ 
III. had sent to Gaeta to delay the inevitable fall of the 
dynasty, was withdrawn at the instance of Great Britain; and 
although the garrison fought bravely and the king and queen 
showed considerable courage, the fortress surrendered on the 
13th of February and the royal family departed by sea. (See 
Francis II., King of the Two Sicilies.) The citadel of Messina 
capitulated a month later, and Civitella del Tronto on the 21st 
of March. On the 18th of February the first Italian parliament 
met at Turin and proclaimed Victor Emmanuel king of Italy. 
Thus Naples and Sicily ceased to be a separate political entity 
and were absorbed into the united Italian kingdom.

NAPOLEON I. (1769-1821), Emperor of the French. Napoleon 
Bonaparte (or Buonaparte, as he almost always spelt the name 
•down the year 1796) was born at Ajaccio in Corsica on the 
15th of August 1769. The date of his birth has been disputed, 
and certain curious facts have been cited in proof of the assertion 
that he was born on the 7th of January 1768, and that his brother 
Joseph, who passed as the eldest surviving son, was in reality 
his junior. Recent research has, however, explained how it came 
about that a son born on the earb'er date received the name 
Nabulione (Napoleon). The father, Carlo Maria da Buonaparte 
(Charles Marie de Bonaparte), had resolved to call his three first 
sons by the names given by his great-grandfather to his sons, 
namely Joseph, Napoleon and Lucien. This was done; but on 
the death of the eldest (Joseph) the child first baptized Nabulion 
received the name Joseph; while the third son (the second 
surviving son) was called Napoleon. The baptismal register of 
Ajaccio leaves no doubt as to the date of his birth as given above. 
For his parents and family see Bonaparte. The father's 
literary tastes, general inquisitiveness, and powers of intrigue 
reappeared in Napoleon, who, however, derived from his mother 
Letizia (a descendant of the Ramolino and Pietra Santa families) 
the force of will, the power of forming a quick decision and of 
maintaining it against all odds, which made him so terrible an 
opponent both in war and in diplomacy. The sterner strain in 
the mother's nature may be traced to intermarriage with the 
families of the wild interior of Corsica, where the vendetta was 
the unwritten but omnipotent law of the land. The Bonapartes, 
on the other hand?, had long concerned themselves with legal 
affairs at Ajaccio or in the coast towns of the island. They 
traced their descent to ancestors who had achieved distinction 
in the political life of medieval Florence and Sarzana; Francesco 
Buonaparte of Sarzana migrated to Corsica early in the 16th 
century. What is equally noteworthy, as explaining the 
characteristics of Napoleon, is that his descent was on both 
sides distinctly patrician. He once remarked that the house of 
Bonaparte dated from the coup d'Ual of Brum aire (November 
1799); but it is certain the de Buonapartes had received the 
title of nobility from the senate of the republic of Genoa which, 
during the 18th century, claimed to exercise sovereignty over 
Corsica. 

It was in the midst of the strifes resulting from those claims 
that Napoleon Bonaparte saw the light in 1 769. His compatriots 
had already freed themselves from the yoke of Genoa, thanks to 
Pasquale Paoli; but in 1764 that republic appealed to Louis XV. 
of France for aid, and in 1768 a bargain was struck by which the 
French government succeeded to the nearly bankrupt sovereignty 
of Genoa. In the campaigns of 1 768-69 the French gradually 
overcame the fierce resistance of the islanders; and Paoli, after 
sustaining a defeat at Ponte-Novo (9th of May 1769), fled to the 
mainland, and ultimately to England. Napoleon's father at first 
sided with Paoh", but after the disaster of Ponte-Novo he went 
over to the conquerors, and thereafter solicited places for himself 
and for his sons with a skill and persistence which led to a close 
union between the Bonapartes and France. From the French 
governor of Corsica, the comte de Marbeuf, he procured many 
favours, among them being the nomination of the young Napoleon 
to the military school at Brienne in the east of France. 

Already the boy had avowed his resolve to be a soldier. In 
the large playroom of the house at Ajaccio, while the others 
amused themselves with ordinary games, Napoleon delighted 
most in beating a drum and wielding a sword. His elder brother, 
Joseph, a mild and dreamy boy, had to give way before him; 
and it was a perception of this difference of temperament which 
decided the father to send Joseph into the church and Napoleon 
into the army. Seeing that the younger boy was almost entirely 
ignorant of French, he took him with Joseph to the college at 
Autun at the close of the year 1 778. After spending four months 
at Autun, Napoleon entered the school at Brienne in May 1779. 



The pupils at Brienne, far from receiving a military education, 
were grounded in ordinary subjects, and in no very efficient 
manner, by brethren of the order, or society, of Minims. The 
moral tone of the school was low; and Napoleon afterwards 
spoke with contempt of the training of the " monks " and the 
manner of life of the scholars. Perhaps his impressions were too 
gloomy; his whole enthusiasm had been for the Corsicans, who 
still maintained an unequal struggle against the French; he 
deeply resented his father's espousal of the French cause; and 
dislike of the conquerors of his native island made him morose 
and solitary. Apart from decided signs of proficiency in mathe- 
matics, he showed no special ability. Languages he disliked, but 
he spent much of his spare time in reading history, especially 
Plutarch. The firmness of character which he displayed caused 
him to be recommended in 1782 for the navy by one of the 
inspectors of the school; but a new inspector, who was appointed 
in 1783, frustrated this plan. In October 1784 Bonaparte and 
three other Briennois were authorized, by a letter signed by 
Louis XVI., to proceed as gentlemen cadets to the military school 
at Paris. There the education was more thorough, and the 
discipline stricter, than at Brienne. Napoleon applied himself 
with more zest to his studies, in the hope of speedily qualifying 
himself for the artillery. In this he succeeded. As the result of 
an examination conducted in September 1785 by Laplace, Bona- 
parte was included among those who entered the army without 
going through an intermediate stage. 

At the end of] October 1785 he closed a scholastic career which 
had beefKcreditable but not brilliant. He now entered the 
artillery regiment, La Fere, quartered at Valence, and went 
through all the duties imposed on privates, and thereafter those 
of a corporal and a sergeant. Not until January 1786 did he 
actually serve as junior lieutenant. A time of furlough in Corsica 
from September 1786 to September 1787 served to strengthen his 
affection for his mother, and for the island which he still hoped 
to free from the French yoke. The father having died of cancer 
at Montpellier in 1785, Napoleon felt added responsibilites, which 
he zealously discharged. In order to push forward a claim which 
Letizia urged on the French government, he proceeded to Paris 
in September 1787, and toyed for a time with the pleasures of the 
Palais Royal, but failed to make good the family claim. After 
gaining a further extension of leave of absence from his regiment 
he returned to Ajaccio and spent six months more in the midst 
of family and political affairs. Rejoining his regiment, then in 
the garrison at Auxonne, after a furlough of twenty-one months, 
the young officer went through a time of much privation, 
brightened only by the study of history and cognate subjects. 
Many of the notes and essays written by him at Auxonne bear 
witness to his indomitable resolve to master all the details of his 
profession and the chief facts relating to peoples who had struggled 
successfully to achieve their liberation. Enthusiasm for Corsica 
was a leading motive prompting him to this prolonged exertion. 
His notes on English history (down to the time of the revolution 
of 1688) were especially detailed. Of Cromwell he wrote: 
" Courageous, clever, deceitful, dissimulating, his early principles 
of lofty republicanism yielded to the devouring flames of his 
ambition; and, having tasted the sweets of power, he aspired to 
the pleasure of reigning alone." At Auxonne, as previously at 
Valence, Napoleon commanded a small detachment of troops 
sent to put down disturbances in neighbouring towns, and carried 
out his orders unflinchingly. To this period belongs his first 
crude literary effort, a polemic against a Genevese pastor who 
had criticized Rousseau. 

In the latter part of his stay at Auxonne (June 1788- 
September 1 789) occurred the first events of the Revolution which 
was destined to mould anew his ideas and his career. But his 
preoccupation about Corsica, the privations to which he and his 
family were then exposed, and his bad health, left him little 
energy to expend on purely French affairs. He read much of the 
pamphlet literature then flooding the country, but he still pre- 
ferred the more general studies in history and literature, Plutarch, 
Caesar, Corneille, Voltaire and Rousseau being his favourite 
authors. The plea of the last named on behalf of Corsica served 



NAPOLEON I. 



i 9 r 



to enlist the sympathy of Napoleon in his wider speculations, 
and so helped to bring about that mental transformation which 
merged Buonaparte the Corsican in Bonaparte the Jacobin 
and Napoleon the First Consul and Emperor. 

Family influences also played their part in this transformation. 
On proceeding to Ajaccio in September 1789 for another furlough, 
he found his brother Joseph enthusiastic in the democratic 
cause and acting as secretary of the local political club. Napoleon 
seconded his efforts, and soon they had the help of the third 
brother, Lucien, who proved to be most eager and eloquent. 
Thanks to the exertions of Saliceti, one of the two deputies sent 
by the tiers etat of Corsica to the National Assembly of France, 
that body, on the 30th of November 1789, declared the island to 
be an integral part of the kingdom with right to participate in 
all the reforms then being decreed. This event decided Napoleon 
to give his adhesion to the French or democratic party; and 
when, in July 1790, Paoli returned from exile in England (receiv- 
ing on his way the honours of the sitting by the National 
Assembly) the claims of nationality and democracy seemed to 
be identical, though the future course of events disappointed 
these hopes. Shortly before returning to his regiment in the 
early weeks of 1791 he indited a letter inveighing in violent 
terms against Matteo Buttafuoco, deputy for the Corsican 
noblesse in the National Assembly of France, as having betrayed 
the cause of insular liberty in 1768 and as plotting against it 
again. 

The experiences of Bonaparte at Auxonne during his second 
stay in garrison were again depressing. With him in his poorly 
furnished lodgings was Louis Bonaparte, the fourth surviving 
son, whom he carefully educated and for whom he predicted a 
brilliant future. For the present their means were very scanty, 
and, as the ardent royalism of his brother officers limited his 
social circle, he plunged into work with the same ardour as before, 
frequently studying fourteen or fifteen hours a day. Then it 
was, or perhaps at a slightly later date, that he became interested 
in the relations subsisting between political science and war. From 
U Esprit des lots of Montesquieu he learnt suggestive thoughts 
like the following: " L'objet de* la guerre, e'est la victoire; 
celui de la victoire, la conquete; celui de la conquete, 1 'occupa- 
tion." Machiavelli taught him the need of speed, decision 
and unity of command, in war. From the TraitS de tactique 
(1772) of Guibert he caught a glimpse of the power which a 
patriotic and fully armed nation might gain amidst the feeble 
and ill-organized governments of that age. 

External events served to unite him more closely to France. 
The reorganization of the artillery, which took place in the spring 
of 1 791, brought Bonaparte to the rank of lieutenant in the 
regiment of Grenoble, then stationed at Valence. He left the 
regiment La Fere with regret on the 14th of June 1791; but at 
Valence he renewed former friendships and plunged into politics 
with greater ardour. Most of his colleagues refused to take 
the oath of obedience to the Constituent Assembly, after the 
attempted escape of Louis XVI. to the eastern frontier at mid- 
summer. Bonaparte took the oath on the 4th of July, but said 
later that the Assembly ought to have banished the king and 
proclaimed a regency for Louis XVII. In general, however, 
his views at that time were republican; he belonged to the club 
of Friends of the Constitution at Valence, spoke there with much 
acceptance, and was appointed librarian to the club. 

At Valence also he wrote an essay for a prize instituted by 
his friend and literary adviser, Raynal, at the academy of 
Lyons. The subject was " What truths and sentiments is it 
most important to inculcate to men for their happiness? " 
Bonaparte's essay bore signs of study of Rousseau and of the 
cult of Lycurgus which was coming into vogue. The Spartans 
were happy, said the writer, because they had plenty of good, 
suitable clothing and lodging, robust women, and were able to 
meet their requirements both physical and mental. Men should 
live according to the laws and dictates of nature, not forgetting 
the claims of reason and sentiment. The latter part of the 
essay is remarkable for its fervid presentment of the charms of 
scenery and for vigorous declamation against the follies and 



crimes of ambitious men. The judges at Lyons placed "it 
fifteenth in order of merit among the sixteen essays sent in. 

Thanks to the friendly intervention of the martchal du camp, 
baron Duteil, Bonaparte once more gained leave of absence 
for three months and reached Corsica in September 1 79 1 . Opinion 
there was in an excited state, the priests and the populace being 
inflamed against the anti-clerical decrees of the National Assembly 
of France. Paoli did little to help on the Bonapartes; and 
the advancement of Joseph Bonaparte was slow. Napoleon's 
admiration for the dictator also began to cool, and events began 
to point to a rupture. The death of Archdeacon Lucien Bona- 
parte, the recognized head of the family, having placed property 
at the disposal of the sons, they bought a house, which became 
the rendezvous of the democrats and of a band of volunteers 
whom they raised. In the intrigues for the command of this 
body Napoleon had his rival, Morati, carried off by force — 
his first coup d'etat. The incident led to a feud with the supporters 
of Morati, among whom was Pozzo di Borgo (destined to be his 
life-long enemy), and opened a breach between the Bonapartes 
and Paoli. Bonaparte's imperious nature also showed itself 
in family matters, which he ruled with a high hand. No one, 
said his younger brother Lucien, liked to thwart him. 

Further discords naturally arose between so masterful a 
lieutenant as Bonaparte and so autocratic a chief as Paoli. 
The beginnings of this rupture, as well as a sharp affray between 
his volunteers and the townsfolk of Ajaccio, may have quickened 
Bonaparte's resolve to return to France in May 1792, but there 
were also personal and family reasons for this step. Having 
again exceeded his time of furlough, he was liable to the severe 
penalties attaching to a deserter and an imigrS; but he saw 
that the circumstances of the time would help to enforce the 
appeal for reinstatement which he resolved to make at Paris. 
His surmise was correct. The Girondin ministry then in power 
had brought Louis XVI. to declare war against Austria (20th 
of April 1792) and against Sardinia (15th of May 1792). The 
lack of trained officers was such as to render the employment 
and advancement of Bonaparte probable in the near future, 
and on the 30th of August, Servan, the minister for war, issued 
an order appointing him to be captain in his regiment and to 
receive arrears of pay. During this stay at Paris he witnessed 
some of the great "days" of the Revolution; but the sad 
plight of his sister, Marianna Elisa, on the dissolution of the 
convent of St Cyr, where she was being educated, compelled 
him to escort her back to Corsica shortly after the September 
massacres. 

His last time of furlough in Corsica is remarkable for the 
failure of the expedition in which he and his volunteers took 
part, against la Maddalena, a small island off the coast of 
Sardinia.- The breach between Paoli and the Bonapartes now 
rapidly widened, the latter having now definitely espoused the 
cause of the French republic, while Paoli, especially after the 
execution of Louis XVI., repudiated all thought of political 
connexion with the regicides. Ultimately the Bonapartes had 
to flee from Corsica (nth of June 1793), an event which clinched 
Napoleon's decision to identify his fortunes with those of the 
French republic. His ardent democratic opinions rendered 
the change natural when Paoli and his compatriots declared for 
an alliance with England. 

The arrival of the Bonapartes at Toulon coincided with a time 
of acute crisis in the fortunes of the republic. Having declared 
war on England and Holland (1st of February 1793), and against 
Spain (9th of March), France was soon girdled by foes; and the 
forces of the first coalition invaded her territory at several points. 
At first the utmost efforts of the republic failed to avert disaster; 
for the intensely royalist district of la Vendee, together with 
most of Brittany, burst into revolt, and several of the northern, 
central and southern departments rose against the Jacobin rule. 
The struggle which the constitutionalists and royalists of 
Marseilles made against the central government furnished 
Bonaparte with an occasion for writing his first important 
political pamphlet, entitled " Le Souper de BeaucaireP It 
purports to be a conversation at the little town of Beaucaire 



192 



NAPOLEON I. 



between a soldier (obviously the writer himself) and three men, 
citizens of Marseilles, Nimes and Montpellier, who oppose the 
Jacobinical government and hope for victory over its forces. 
The officer points out the folly of such a course, and the 
certainty that the republic, whose troops had triumphed over 
those of Prussia and Austria, will speedily disperse the untrained 
levies of Provence. The pamphlet closes with a passionate 
plea for national unity. 

He was now to further the cause of the republic one and 
indivisible in the sphere of action. The royalists of Toulon had 
admitted British and Spanish forces to share in the defence of 
that stronghold (29th of August 1793). The blow to the re- 
publican cause was most serious: for from Toulon as a centre 
the royalists threatened to raise a general revolt throughout the 
south of France, and Pitt cherished hopes of dealing a death-blow 
to the Jacobins in that quarter. But fortune now brought 
Bonaparte to bb'ght those hopes. Told off to serve in the army 
of Nice, he was detained by a special order of the commissioners 
of the Convention, Saliceti and Gasparin, who, hearing of the 
severe wound sustained by Dommartin, the commander of the 
artillery of the republican forces before Toulon, ordered Bona- 
parte to take his place. He arrived at the republican head- 
quarters, then at Ollioules on the north-west of Toulon, on the 
16th of September; and it .is noteworthy that as early as Sep- 
tember 10th the commissioners had seen the need of attacking 
the allied fleet and had paid some attention to the headland 
behind l'figuillette, which commanded both the outer and the 
inner harbour. But there is no doubt that Bonaparte brought 
to bear on the execution of this as yet vague and general proposal 
powers of concentration and organization which ensured its 
success. In particular he soon put the artillery of the besiegers 
in good order. Carteaux, an ex-artist, at first held the supreme 
command, but was superseded on the 23rd of October. Doppet, 
the next commander, was little better fitted for the task; but 
his successor, Dugommier, was a brave and experienced soldier 
who appreciated the merits of Bonaparte. Under their direction 
steady advance was made on the side which Bonaparte saw to 
be all important; a sortie of part of the British, Spanish and 
Neapolitan forces on the 30th of November was beaten back 
with loss, General O'Hara, their commander, being severely 
wounded and taken prisoner. On the night of the i6th-i7th 
December, Dugommier, Bonaparte, Victor and Muiron headed 
the storming column which forced its way into the chief battery 
thrown up by the besieged on the height behind Pfiguillette; 
and on the next day Hood and Langara set sail, leaving the 
royalists to the vengeance of the Jacobins. General du Teil, 
the younger, who took part in the siege, thus commented on 
Bonaparte's services: " I have no words in which to describe 
the merit of Bonaparte: much science, as much intelligence and 
too much bravery. ... It is for you, Ministers, to consecrate 
him to the glory of the republic." At Toulon Bonaparte made 
the acquaintance of men who were to win renown under his 
leadership — Desaix, Junot, Marmont, Muiron, Suchet and 
Victor. 

It is often assumed that the fortunes of Bonaparte were made 
at Toulon. This is an exaggeration. True, on the 22nd of 
December 1793 he was made general of brigade for his services; 
and in February 1794 he gained the command of the artillery 
in the French army about to invade Italy; but during the 
preliminary work of fortification along the coast he was placed 
under arrest for a time owing to his reconstruction of an old fort 
at Marseilles which had been destroyed during the Revolution. 
He was soon released owing to the interposition of the younger 
Robespierre and of Saliceti. Thereafter he resided successively 
at Toulon, St Tropez and Antibes, doing useful work in fortifying 
the coast and using his spare time in arduous study of the science 
of war. This he had already begun at Auxonne under the in- 
spiring guidance of the baron du Teil. General du Teil, younger 
brother of the baron, had recently published a work, V Usage de 
Vartillerie nouvelle; and it is now known that Bonaparte derived 
from this work and from those of Guibert and Bourcet that lead- 
ing principle, concentration of effort against one point of the 



enemy's line, which he had advocated at Toulon and which he 
everywhere put in force in his campaigns. 

On or about the 20th of March 1794 he arrived at the head- 
quarters of the army of Italy. At Colmars, on the 21st of May 
1794, he drew up the first draft of his Italian plan of campaign 
for severing the Piedmontese from their Austrian allies and for 
driving the latter out of their Italian provinces. A secret mission 
to Genoa enabled him to inspect the pass north of Savona, and 
the knowledge of the peculiarities of that district certainly helped 
him in maturing his plan for an invasion of Italy, which he put 
into execution in 1796. For the present he experienced a sharp 
rebuff of fortune, which he met with his usual fortitude. He 
was suddenly placed under arrest owing to intrigues or suspicions 
of the men raised to power by the coup d J €tat of Thermidoro-10 
(July 27-28) 1794. The commissioners sent by the Convention, 
Alhitte, Laporte and Saliceti, suspected him of having divulged 
the plan of campaign, and on the 6th of August ordered his 
arrest as being the " maker of plans " for the younger Robes- 
pierre. On a slighter accusation than this many had perished; 
but an examination into the details of the mission of Bonaparte 
to Genoa and the new instructions which arrived from Carnot, 
availed to procure his release on the 20th of August. It came in 
time to enable him to share in the operations of the French army 
against the Austrians that led to the battle of Dego, north of 
Savona (21st of September), a success largely due to his skilful 
combinations. But the decline in the energies of the central 
government at Paris and the appointment of Scherer as com- 
mander-in-chief of the army of Italy frustrated the plans of a 
vigorous offensive which Bonaparte continued to develop and 
advocate. 

Meanwhile he took part in' an expedition fitted out in the 
southern ports to drive the English from Corsica. It was a 
complete failure, and for a time his prospects were overclouded. 
In the spring of 1795 ne received an order from Paris to proceed 
to la Vendee in command of an infantry brigade. He declined 
on the score of ill-health, but set out for Paris in May, along with 
Marmont, Junot and Louis Bonaparte. At the capital he found 
affairs quickly falling back into the old ways of pleasure and 
luxury. " People," he wrote, " remember the Terror only as a 
dream." That he still pursued his studies of military affairs is 
shown by the compilation of further plans for the Italian cam- 
paign. The news of the ratification of peace with Spain brought 
at once the thought that an offensive plan of campaign in Pied- 
mont was thenceforth inevitable. Probably these plans gained 
for him an appointment (20th of August) in the topographical 
bureau of the committee of Public Safety. But, cither from 
weariness of the life at Paris, or from disgust at clerical work, 
he sought permission to go to Turkey in order to reorganize the 
artillery of the Sultan. But an inspection of his antecedents 
showed the many irregularities of his conduct as officer and led 
to his name being erased from the list of general officers (Sep- 
tember 15th). 

Again the difficulty of the republic was to be his opportunity. 
The action of the Convention in perpetuating its influence by 
the imposition of two-thirds of its members on the next popularly 
elected councils, aroused a storm of indignation in Paris, where 
the " moderate " and royalist reaction was already making 
headway. The result was the massing of some 30,000 National 
Guards to coerce the Convention. Confronted by this serious 
danger, the Convention entrusted its defence to B arras, who 
appointed the young officer to be one of the generals assisting 
him. The vigour and tactical skill of Bonaparte contributed 
very largely to the success of the troops of the Convention over 
the Parisian malcontents on the famous day of 13 Vendemiaire 
(October 5th, 1795), when the defenders of the Convention, 
sweeping the quays and streets near the Tuillcries by artillery 
and musketry, soon paralysed the movement at its headquarters, 
the church of St Roch. The results of this day were out of all 
proportion to the comparatively small number of casualties. 
With the cost of about 200 killed on either side, the Convention 
crushed the royalist or malcontent reaction, and imposed on 
France a form of government which ensured the perpetuation of

democracy though in a bureaucratic form — the first of those 
changes which paved the way to power for Bonaparte. For the 
constitution of the year 1795 which inaugurated the period of 
the Directory (1 795-1799) see French Revolution. Here we 
may notice that the perpetuation of the republic by means of 
the armed forces tended to exalt the army at the expense of the 
civil authorities. The repetition of the same tactics by Bonaparte 
in Fructidor, 1797, served still more decidedly to tilt the balance 
in favour of the sword, with results which were to be seen at the 
coup <TUat of Brumaire 1799. 

The events which helped the disgraced officer of August 1795 
to impose his will on France in November 1799 now claim our 
attention. The services which he rendered to the republic at 
Vendemiaire brought as their reward the hand of Josephine 
de Beauharnais. The influence of Barras with this fashionable 
lady helped on the match. At the outset she felt some repugnance 
for the thin sallow-faced young officer, and was certainly terrified 
by his ardour and by the imperious egoism of his nature; but 
she consented to the union, especially when he received the 
promise of the command of the French army of Italy. The story 
that he owed this promotion solely to the influence of Barras 
and Josephine is, however, an exaggeration. It is now known that 
the plans of campaign which he had drawn up for that army 
had enlisted the far more influential support of Carnot on his 
behalf. In January 1796 he drew up another plan for the 
conquest of Italy, which gained the assent of the Directory. 
Vendemiaire and the marriage with Josephine (9th of March 
1796) were but stepping-stones to the attainment of the end 
which he had kept steadily in sight since the spring of the year 
1794. For the events of this campaign in Italy see French 
Revolutionary Wars. The success at the bridge of Lodi (roth of 
May) seems first to have inspired in the young general dreams of a 
grander career than that of a successful general of the Revolution; 
while his narrow escape at the bridge of Areola in November 
strengthened his conviction that he was destined for a great 
future. The means whereby he engaged the energies of the 
Italians on behalf of the French Republic and yet refrained 
from persecuting the Roman Catholic Church in the way only 
too common among revolutionary generals, bespoke political 
insight of no ordinary kind. From every dispute which he had 
with the central authorities at Paris he emerged victorious; 
and he took care to assure his ascendancy by sending presents 
to the Directors, large sums to the nearly bankrupt treasury 
and works of art to the museums of Paris. Thus when, after the 
crowning victory of Rivoli (14th of January 1797), Mantua 
surrendered and the Austrian rule in Italy for the time collapsed, 
Bonaparte was virtually the idol of the French nation, the 
master of the Directory and potentially the protector of the 
Holy See. 

It may be well to point out here the salient features in Bona- 
parte's conduct towards the states of northern Italy. While 
arousing the enthusiasm of their inhabitants on behalf of France, 
he in private spoke contemptuously of them, mercilessly sup- 
pressed all outbreaks caused by the exactions and plundering 
of his army, and carefully curbed the factions which the new 
political life soon developed. On his first entry into Milan 
(15th of May 1796) he received a rapturous welcome as the 
liberator of Italy from the Austrian yoke; but the instructions 
of the Directory allowed him at the outset to do little more than 
effect the organization of consultative committees and national 
guards in the chief towns of Lombardy. The successful course 
of the campaign and the large sums which he sent from Italy to 
the French exchequer served to strengthen his hold over' the 
Directors, and his constructive policy grew more decided. 
Thus, when the men of Reggio and Modena overthrew the rule 
of their duke, he at once accorded protection to them, as also to 
the inhabitants of the cities of Bologna and Ferrara when they 
broke away from papal authority. He even allowed the latter 
to send delegates to confer with those of the duchy at Modena, 
with the result that a political union was decreed in a state 
called the Cispadane Republic (16th of October 1796)- This 
action was due in large measure to the protection of Bonaparte. 
xix. 7 



The men of Lombardy, emboldened by his tacit encouragement, 
prepared at the close of the year to form a republic, which 
assumed the name of Transpadane, and thereafter that of 
Cisalpine. Its constitution was drawn up in the spring of 
1797 by committees appointed, and to some extent supervised, 
by him; and he appointed the first directors, deputies and chief 
administrators of the new state (July 1797). The union of these 
republics took place on the 15th of July 1797. The bounds 
of the thus enlarged Cisalpine Republic were afterwards ex- 
tended eastwards to the banks of the Adige by the terms of 
the treaty of Campo Formio; and in November 1797 Bonaparte 
added the formerly Swiss district of the Valtelline, north-east 
of Lake Como, to its territory. Much of this work of reorganiza- 
tion was carried on at the castle of Montebello, or Mombello, 
near Milan, where he lived in almost viceregal pomp (May-July, 
1797). Taking advantage of an outbreak at Genoa, he over- 
threw that ancient oligarchy, replaced it by a form of government 
modelled on that of France (June 6th); and subsequently it 
adopted the name of the Ligurian Republic. 

Concurrently with these undertakings, he steadily prepared to 
strengthen his position in the political life of France; and it will 
be well to notice the steps by which he ensured the defeat of the 
royalists in France and the propping up of the directorial system 
in the coup d J itat of Fructidor 1797. The unrest in France in the 
years 1795-^97 resulted mainly from the harshness, incom- 
petence and notorious corruption of the five Directors who, 
after the 13th of Vendemiaire 1795, practically governed France. 
All those who wished for peace and orderly government came by 
degrees to oppose the Directors; and, seeing that the latter clung 
to Jacobinical catchwords and methods, public opinion tended 
to become " moderate " or even royalist. This was seen in the 
elections for one-third of the 750 members composing the two 
councils of the nation (the Anciens and the Council of Five 
Hundred); they gave the moderates a majority alike in that 
of the older deputies and in that of the younger deputies (April 
1797), and that majority elected Barthelemy, a well-known 
moderate, as the fifth member of the Directory. Carnot, the 
ablest administrator, but not the strongest man, soon joined 
Barthe'lemy in opposing their Jacobinical colleagues — Barras, 
Rewbell and Larevelliere-Lepeaux. Time was on the side of 
the moderates; they succeeded in placing General Pichegru, 
already known for his tendencies towards constitutional monarchy, 
in the presidential chair of the Council of Five Hundred; and 
they proceeded to agitate, chiefly through the medium of a 
powerful club founded at Clichy, for the repeal of the revolu- 
tionary and persecuting laws. The three Jacobinical Directors 
thereupon intrigued to bring to Paris General Lazarre Hoche 
and his army destined for the invasion of Ireland for the purpose 
of coercing their opponents; but these, perceiving the danger, 
ordered Hoche to Paris, rebuked him for bringing his army 
nearer to the capital than was aDowed by law, and dismissed 
him in disgrace. 

The failure of Hoche led the three Directors to fix their hopes 
on Bonaparte. The commander of the ever-victorious army of 
Italy had recently been attacked by one of the moderates in the 
councils ior proposing to hand over Venice to Austria. This 
cession was based on political motives, which Bonaparte judged 
to be of overwhelming force; and he now decided to support 
the Directors and overthrow the moderates. Prefacing his action 
by a violent tirade against the royalist conspirators of Clichy, 
he sent to Paris General Augereau, well known for his brusque 
behaviour and demagogic Jacobinism. This officer rushed to 
Paris, breathing out threats of slaughter against all royalists, 
and entered into close relations with Barras. In order to dis- 
count the chances of failure, Bonaparte warned the three Directors 
that Augereau was a turbulent politician, not to be trusted over- 
much. Events, indeed, might readily have gone in favour of 
the moderates had Carnot acted with decision; but he relapsed 
into strange inactivity, while Barras and his military tool 
prepared to coerce the majority. Before dawn of September 
the 4th (18 Fructidor) Augereau with 2000 soldiers marched 
against the Tuileries, where the councils were sitting, dispersed 



i 9 4 



NAPOLEON I. 



their military guards, arrested several deputies and seized 
Barthelemy in his bed. Carnot, on receiving timely warning, 
fled from the Luxemburg palace and made his way to Switzer- 
land. The remembrance of the fatal day of Vendemiaire 1795 
perhaps helped to paralyse the majority. In any case exile, and 
death in the prisons of Cayenne, now awaited the timid champions 
of law and order; while parliamentary rule sustained a shock 
from which it never recovered. The Councils allowed the elec- 
tions to be annulled in forty-nine departments of France, and 
re-enacted some of the laws of the period of the Terror, notably 
those against non-juring priests and returned SmigrSs. The 
election of Merlin of Douay and Francois of Neufchatel as 
Directors, in place of Carnot and Barthelemy, gave to that body 
a compactness which enabled it to carry matters with a high 
hand, until the hatred felt by Frenchmen for this soulless revival 
of a moribund Jacobinism gradually endowed the Chambers 
with life and strength sufficient to provoke a renewal of strife 
with the Directory. These violent oscillations not only weakened 
the fabric of the Republic, but brought about a situation in 
which Bonaparte easily paralysed both the executive and the 
legislative powers so ill co-ordinated by the constitution of the 
year 1795. 

In the sphere of European diplomacy, no less than in that 
of French politics, the results of the coup d'itat of Fructidor 
were momentous. The Fructidorian Directors contemptuously 
rejected the overtures for peace which Pitt had recently made 
through the medium of Lord Malmesbury at Lille; and they 
further illustrated their desire for war and plunder by initiating 
a forward policy in central Italy and Switzerland which opened 
up a new cycle of war. The coup d'itat was favourable to Bona- 
parte; it ensured his hold over the Directors and enabled him 
to impose his own terms of peace on Austria; above all it left 
him free for the prosecution of his designs in a field of action 
which now held the first place in his thoughts — the Orient. 
Having rivalled the exploits of Caesar, he now longed to follow 
in the steps of Alexander the Great. 

At the time of his first view of the Adriatic (February 1797) 
he noted the importance of the port of Ancona for intercourse 
with the Sultan's dominions; and at that city fortune placed 
in his hands Russian despatches relative to the designs of the 
Tsar Paul on Malta. The incident reawakened the interest 
which had early been aroused in the young Corsican by converse 
with the savant Volney, author of Les Ruines, ou meditation sur 
les revolutions des empires. The intercourse which he had with 
Monge, the physicist and ex-minister of marine, during the 
negotiations with Austria, served to emphasize the orientation 
of his thoughts. This explains the eagerness with which he now 
insisted on the acquisition of the Ionian Isles by France and the 
political extinction of their present possessor, Venice. That city 
had given him cause for complaint, of which he made the most 
unscrupulous use. Thanks to the blind complaisance of its 
democrats and the timid subserviency of its once haughty 
olfgarchs, he became master of its fleet and arsenal (16th of May 
1797). Already, as may be seen by his letters to the Directory, 
he had laid his plans for the bartering away of the Queen of the 
Adriatic to Austria; and throughout the lengthy negotiations of 
the summer and early autumn of 1797 which he conducted with 
little interference from Paris, he adhered to his plan of gaining 
the fleet and the Ionian Isles; while the house of Habsburg 
was to acquire the city itself, together with all the mainland 
territories of the Republic as far west as the River Adige. In 
vain did the Austrian envoy, Cobenzl, resist the cession of the 
Ionian Isles to France; in vain did the Directors intervene in the 
middle of September with an express order that Venice must 
" not he ceded to Austria, but must, along with Friuli, be included 
in the Cisalpine Republic. To the subtle tenacity of Cobenzl he 
opposed a masterful violence: he checkmated the Directors, 
when they sought to thwart him in this and in other directions, 
by sending in once more his resignation with a letter in which he 
accused them of " horrible ingratitude." He was successful 
at all points. The Directors feared a rupture with the man 
to whom they owed their existence; and the house of Austria 



was fain to make peace with the general rather than expose itself 
to harder terms at the hands of the Directory. 

The treaty of Campo Formio, signed on the 17th of October 
1797, was therefore pre-eminently the work of Bonaparte. 
Already at Cherasco and Leoben he had dictated the preliminaries 
of peace to the courts of Turin and Vienna quite independently 
of the French Directory. At Campo Formio he showed himself 
the first diplomatist of the age, and the arbiter of the destinies 
of Europe. The terms were on the whole unexpectedly favour- 
able to Austria. In Italy she was to acquire the Venetian lands 
already named, along with Dalmatia and Venetian Istria. The 
rest of the Venetian mainland (the districts between the rivers 
Adige and Ticino) went to the newly constituted Cisalpine 
republic," France gaining the Ionian Isles and the Venetian fleet. 
The Emperor Francis renounced all claims to his former Nether- 
land provinces, which had been occupied by the French since 
the summer of 1794; he further ceded the Breisgau to the dis- 
possessed duke of Modena, agreed to summon a congress at 
Rastatt for the settlement of German affairs, and recognized the 
independence of the Cisalpine republic. In secret articles the 
emperor bound himself to use his influence at the congress of 
Rastatt in order to procure the cession to France of the Germanic 
lands west of the Rhine, while France promised to help him to 
acquire the archbishopric of Salzburg and a strip of land on the 
eastern frontier of Bavaria. 

After acting for a brief space as one of the French envoys to the 
congress of Rastatt, Napoleon returned to Paris early in December 
and received the homage of the Directors and the acclaim of the 
populace. The former sought to busy him by appointing him 
commander-in-chief of the Army of England, the island power 
being now the only one which contested French supremacy in 
Europe. In February 1798 he inspected the preparations for the 
invasion of England then proceeding at the northern ports. 
He found that they were wholly inadequate, and summed up his 
views in a remarkable letter to the Directory (23rd of February), 
wherein he pointed out two possible alternatives to an invasion of 
England, namely, a conquest of the coast of the north-west of 
Germany, for the cutting off of British commerce with central 
Europe, or the undertaking of an expedition to the Orient which 
would be equally ruinous to British trade. The inference was 
inevitable that, as German affairs were about to be profitably 
exploited by France in the bargains then beginning at Rastatt, 
she must throw her chief energies into the Egyptian expedition. 

One of the needful preliminaries of this enterprise" had already 
received his attention. In November 1797 he sent to Malta 
Poussielgue, secretary of the French legation at Genoa, on busi- 
ness which was ostensibly commercial but (as» he informed the 
Directory) " in reality to put the last touch to the design that 
we have on that island." The intrigues of the French envoy 
in corrupting the knights of the order of St John were completely 
successful. It remained, however, to find the funds needful 
for the equipment of a great expedition. Here the difficulties 
were great. The Directory, after the coup d'itat of Fructidor, 
had acknowledged a state of bankruptcy by writing off two- 
thirds of the national debt in a form which soon proved to be a 
thin disguise for repudiation. The return of a large part of the 
armed forces from Italy and Germany, where they had lived on 
the liberated inhabitants, also threw new burdens on the Republic; 
and it was clear that French money alone would not suffice to 
fit out an armada. Again, however, the financial situation was 
improved by conquest. The occupation of Rome in February 
1798 enabled Berthier to send a considerable sum to Paris and 
to style himself " treasurer to the chest of the Army of England." 
The invasion of Switzerland, which Bonaparte had of late 
persistently pressed on the Directory, proved to be an equally 
lucrative device, the funds in several of the cantonal treasuries 
being transferred straightway to Paris or Toulon. The conquest 
of north and central Italy also placed great naval resources at 
the disposal of France, Venice alone providing nine sail of the 
line and twelve frigates (see Bonaparte's letter of the 15th of 
November 1797), Genoa, Spezzia, Leghorn, Civita Vecchia 
and Ancona also supplied their quota in warships, transports,

stores and sailors, with the result that the armada was ready 
for sea by the middle of May 1798. The secrecy maintained as 
to its destination was equally remarkable. The British govern- 
ment inclined to the belief that it was destined either for Ireland 
or for Naples. As the British fleet had abandoned the Mediter- 
ranean since November 1796 and had recently been disorganized 
by two serious mutinies, Bonaparte's plan of conquering Egypt 
was L by no means so rash as has sometimes been represented. 

The ostensible aims of the expedition, as drawn up by him, 
and countersigned by the Directory on the 1 2th of April, were 
the seizure of Egypt, the driving of the British from all their 
possessions in the East and the cutting of the Suez canal. But 
apart from these public aims there were private motives which 
weighed with Bonaparte. His relations to the Directors were 
most strained. They feared his ability and ambition; while 
he credited them with the design of poisoning him. Shortly 
before his starting, an open rupture was scarcely averted; 
and he and his brothers allowed the idea to get abroad that he 
was being virtually banished from France. It is certain, however, 
that his whole heart was in the expedition, which appealed to 
his love of romance and of the gigantic. His words to Joseph 
Bonaparte shortly before sailing are significant: " Our dreams 
of a republic were youthful illusions. Since the 9th of Thermidor, 
the republican instinct has grown weaker every day. To-day 
all eyes are on me: to-morrow they may be on another. ... I 
depart for the Orient with all the means of success at my disposal. 
If my country needs me, if there are additions to the number 
of those who share the opinion of Talleyrand, Sieves and Roederer, 
that war will break out again and that it will be unsuccessful 
for France, I will return, more sure of the feeling of the nation." 
He added, however, that if France waged a successful war, he 
would remain in the East, and do more damage to England 
there than by mere demonstrations in the English Channel. 

The Toulon fleet set sail on the 19th of May; and when the 
other contingents from the ports of France and Italy joined the 
flag, the armada comprised thirteen sail of the iine, fourteen 
frigates, many smaller warships and some three hundred trans- 
ports. An interesting feature of the expedition was the presence 
on board of several savants who were charged to examine the 
antiquities and develop the resources of Egypt. The chief had 
lately become a member of the Institute, and did his utmost 
to inflame in France that love of art and science which he had 
helped to kindle by enriching the museums of Paris with the 
treasures of Italy. By good fortune the armada evaded Nelson 
and arrived safely off Malta. Thanks to French intrigues, the 
Knights of Malta offered the tamest defence of their capital. 
During the week which he spent there, Bonaparte displayed 
marvellous energy in endowing the city with modern institutions; 
he even arranged the course of studies to be followed in the 
university. Setting sail for Egypt on the 19th of June, he 
again had the good fortune to elude Nelson and arrived off 
Alexandria on the 2nd of July. For an account of the Egyptian 
and Syrian campaigns see French Revolutionary Wars. 
But here we may point out the influence of the expedition on 
Egypt, on European politics and on the fortunes of Bonaparte. 
The chief direct result in the life of the Egyptian people was the 
virtual destruction of the governing caste of the Mamelukes, 
the Turks finding it easy to rid themselves of their surviving 
chiefs and to re-establish the authority of the Sultan. As for the 
benefits which Bonaparte and his savants helped to confer on 
Egypt, they soon vanished. The great canal was not begun; 
irrigation works were started but were soon given up. The 
letters of Kleber and Menou (the successors of Bonaparte) 
show that the expenditure on public works had been so reckless 
that the colony was virtually bankrupt at the time of Bonaparte's 
departure; and William Hamilton, who travelled through Egypt 
in 1802, found few traces, other than military, of the French 
occupation. The indirect results, however, were incalculably 
great. Though for the present the Sultan regained his hold 
' upon Egypt, yet in reality Bonaparte set in motion forces which 
could not be stayed until the ascendancy of one or other of the 
western maritime powers in that land was definitely decided. 



The effects of the expedition in the sphere of world-politics 
were equally remarkable and more immediate. The British 
government, alarmed by Bonaparte's attempt to intrigue with 
Tippoo Sahib, put forth all its strength in India and destroyed 
the power of that ambitious ruler. Nelson's capture of Malta 
(5th of September r8oo) also secured for the time a sure base 
for British fleets in the Mediterranean. A Russo-Turkish fleet 
wrested Corfu from the French; and the Neapolitan Bourbons, 
emboldened by the news of the battle of the Nile, began hostilities 
with France which preluded the war of the Second Coalition. 
In the domain of science the results of the expedition were of 
unique interest. The discovery of the Rosetta Stone furnished 
the key to Egyptian hieroglyphics; and archaeology, no less 
than the more practical sciences, acknowledges its debt of grati- 
tude to the man who first brought the valley of the Nile into close 
touch with the thought of the West. 

Finally, it should be noted that, amid the failure of the national 
aims which the Directory and Bonaparte set forth, his own 
desires received a startlingly complete fulfilment. The war of 
the Second Coalition having brought about the expulsion of 
the French from Italy, the Directors were exposed to a storm 
of indignation in France, not unmixed with contempt; and this 
state of public opinion enabled the young conqueror within a 
month of his landing at Frejus (9th of October 1799) easily to 
prevail over the Directory and the elective councils of the nation. 
In the spring of 1798 he had judged the pear to be not ripe; 
in Brumaire 1799 it came off almost at a touch. 

In order to understand the sharp swing of the political pendulum 
back from republicanism to autocracy which took place at 
Brumaire, it is needful to remember that the virtual failure of 
the Egyptian Expedition was then unknown. The news of 
Bonaparte's signal victory over the Turkish army at Aboukir 
aroused general rejoicings undimmed by any save the vaguest 
rumours of his reverse at Acre. In the popular imagination he 
seemed to be the only possible guarantor of victory abroad and 
order at home. This was unjust to the many men who were 
working, not without success, to raise the Republic out of its 
many difficulties. Massena's triumph at Zurich (September 
25th-26th, 1799) paralysed the Second Coalition; and, though 
the Austrians continued to make progress along the Italian 
riviera, the French Republic was in little danger on that side 
so long as it held Switzerland. 

The internal condition of France was also not so desperate 
as has often been represented. True, the Directory seemed on 
the point of collapse; it had been overcome by the popularly 
elected Chambers in the insignificant coup d'itat of 30 Prairial 
(18th of June) 1799; when Larevelliere-Lepeaux and Merlin 
were compelled to resign. The retirement of Rewbell a short 
time previously also rid France of a turbulent and corrupt 
administrator. His place was now filled by Sieves. This ex- 
priest, this disillusioned Jacobin and skilful spinner of cobweb 
constitutions, enjoyed for a time the chief reputation in France. 
His oracular reserve, personal honesty and consistency of aim 
had gained him the suffrages of all who hoped to save France 
from the harpies of the Directory and the violent rhetoricians 
of the now reconstituted Jacobin Club. He was known to dis- 
approve of the Directory both as an institution in the making of 
which he had had no hand, and of its personnel, with one excep- 
tion. This was natural. The new Directors, Gohier and Moulin, 
were honest but incapable and narrow-minded. As for Barras, 
his venality and vices outweighed even his capacity for successful 
intrigue. The fifth Director, Ducos, an ex-Girondin, was sure to 
swim with the stream. Clearly, then, the Directory was doomed. 

It was far otherwise with the Councils. A majority of the 
Ancients was ready to support Sieves and make drastic changes 
in the constitution; but in the Council of Five Hundred the 
prevalent feeling was democratic or even Jacobinical. The 
aim of Sieves was to perpetuate the republic, but in a bureau- 
cratic or autocratic form. With this aim in view he sought to 
find a man possessing ability in war and probity in civil affairs, 
who would act as figure-head to his long projected constitution. 
For a time affairs moved as he wished. The Jacobin Club was

closed, thanks to the ability of Fouch6, the new minister of 
Police; but the hopes of Sieyes were dashed by the death of 
General Joubert, commander of the Army of Italy, at the 
disastrous battle of Novi (15th of August). The dearth of ability 
among the generals left in France (Kleber and Desaix were in 
Egypt) was now painfully apparent. Moreau was notoriously 
lethargic in civil affairs. Bernadotte, Jourdan and Augereau 
had compromised themselves by close association with the 
Jacobins. The soldiery had never forgiven Massena his pecula- 
tions after the capture of Rome. One name, and one alone, 
leaped to men's thoughts, that of Bonaparte. 

He arrived from Egypt at the psychological moment, and his 
journey from Frejus to Paris resembled a triumphant procession. 
Nevertheless he acted with the utmost caution. A fortnight 
passed before he decided to support Sieyes in effecting a change 
in the constitution; and by then he had captivated all men 
except Bernadotte and a few intransigeant Jacobins. Talleyrand, 
Roederer, Cambaceres and R6al were among his special con- 
fidants, his brothers Joseph and Lucien also giving useful 
advice. Of the generals, Murat, Berthier, Lannes and Leclerc 
were those who prepared the way for the coup d'etat. Fouche, 
pulling the wires through the police, was an invaluable helper. 
The conduct of Barras was known to depend on material 
considerations. 

All being ready, the Ancients on the 18 Brumaire (9th of 
November) decreed .the transference of the sessions of both 
Councils to St Cloud, on the plea of a Jacobin plot which 
threatened the peace of Paris. They also placed the troops in 
Paris and its neighbourhood under the cpmmand of Bonaparte. 
Thereupon Sieyes and Ducos resigned office. Barras, after a cal- 
culating delay, followed suit. Gohier and Moulin, on refusing 
to retire, were placed under a military guard; and General 
Moreau showed his political incapacity by discharging this duty, 
for the benefit of Bonaparte. 

Nevertheless the proceedings of St Cloud on the day following 
bade fair to upset the best-laid schemes of Bonaparte and his 
' coadjutors. The Five Hundred, meeting in the Orangerie of 
the palace, had by this time seen through the plot; and, on the 
entrance of the general with four grenadiers, several deputies 
rushed at him, shook him violently, while others vehemently 
demanded a decree of outlawry against the new Cromwell. He 
himself lost his nerve, stammered, nearly fainted, and was dragged 
out by the soldiers in a state of mental and physical collapse. 
The situation was saved solely by the skill of his brother Lucien, 
then president of the Council. He refused to put the vote of 
outlawry, uttered a few passionate words, cast off his official 
robes, declared the session at an end, and made his way out under 
protection of a squad of grenadiers. The coup d J Uat seemed to 
have failed. In reality matters now rested with the troops out- 
side. Stung to action by some words of Sieyes, Bonaparte 
appealed to the troops of the line in terms which provoked a 
ready response. Imprecations uttered by Lucien against 
the brigands and traitors in the pay of England decided the 
grenadiers of the Council to march against the deputies whom 
it was their special duty to protect. Drums beat the charge, 
Murat led the way through the corridors of the palace to the 
Orangerie, and levelled bayonets ended the existence of the 
Council. Within the space of ten and a half years from the 
summoning of the States-General at Versailles (May 1789), 
parliamentary government fell beneath the sword. 

Lucien now consolidated the work of the soldiery by procuring 
from the Ancients a decree which named Bonaparte, Sieyes and 
Ducos as provisional consuls, while a legislative commission was 
appointed to report on necessary changes in the constitution. 
Lucien also gathered together a small group of the younger 
deputies to throw the cloak of legality over the events of the 
day. The Rump proceeded to expel sixty-one Jacobins from 
the Council of Five Hundred, adjourned its sessions until the 19th 
of February 1800, and appointed a commission of twenty-five 
members with power to act in the meantime. Clearly the success 
of the coup d'itat of Brumaire was due in the last resort to Lucien 
Bonaparte. 



The Parisians received the news of the event with joy, be- 
lieving that freedom was now at last to be established on a firm 
basis by the man whose name was the synonym for victory in the 
field and disinterestedness in dvil affairs. " People are full of 
mirth " (wrote Madame Reinhard, wife of the minister for 
Foreign Affairs, four days later) " believing that they have 
regained liberty." She added that all the parties except the 
Jacobins were full of confidence; and that the nobles now 
cherished hopes of a reaction, seeing that the reduction of the 
number of rulers from five to three pointed towards monarchy. 
Her comment on this delusion is instructive. Three consuls 
had been appointed, she remarked, precisely in order that power 
might not be vested in the hands of one man. 

Only by degrees did the events of the 19th of Brumaire stand 
but in their real significance; for the new consuls, installed at 
the Luxemburg palace, and somewhat later at the Tuileries, 
took care that the new constitution, which they along with the 
two commissions were now secretly drawing up, should not be 
promulgated until Paris and France had settled down to the 
ordinary life of pleasure and toil. In the meantime they won 
credit by popular measures such as the abolition of forced loans 
and of the objectionable habit of seizing hostages from the 
districts of the west where the royalist ferment was still strongly 
working. 

The feelings of suprise at the clemency and moderation 
with which the victors used their powers predisposed men every- 
where to accept their constitution. Sieyes now sketched its out- 
lines in vaguely republican forms; thereupon Bonaparte freely 
altered them and gave them strongly personal touches. The 
theorist laid before the joint commission his projet, the result of 
five years of cogitation, only to have it ridiculed by the great 
soldier. In one respect alone did it suit him. While restoring 
the principle of universal suffrage, which had been partially 
abrogated in 1795, Sieyes rendered this system of election 
practically a nullity. The voters were to choose one-tenth of 
their number (notabilities of the commune) ; one-tenth of these 
would form the notabilities of the department; while by a 
similar decimal sifting, the notabilities of the nation were selected. 
The final and all-important act of selection from among these 
men was, however, to be made by a personage, styled the pro- 
clamateur-ilecteur, who chose all the important functionaries, and, 
conjointly with the notabilities of the nation, chose the members 
for the Council of State (wielding the chief executive powers), 
the Tribunate and the Senate. The latter body would, however, 
have the power to " absorb " the head of the state if he showed 
signs of ambition. Against this power of absorption Bonaparte 
declaimed vehemently, asserting also that the proclamateur- 
ilecteur would be a mere cochon & Vengrais. In vain did Sieyes 
modify his scheme so as to provide for two consuls, one holding 
the chief executive powers for war, the other for peace. This 
division of powers was equally distasteful to Bonaparte: he 
formed a kind of cabal within the joint commission, and there 
intimidated the theorist, with the result already foreseen by the 
latter. Sieyes, conscious that his political mechanism would 
merely winnow the air, until the profoundly able and forceful 
man at his side adapted it to the work of government, relapsed 
into silence; and his resignation of the office of consul, together 
with that of Ducos, was announced as imminent. Bonaparte 
further brushed aside a frankly democratic constitution pro- 
posed by Daunou, and intimidated his opponents in the joint 
commission by a threat that he would himself draft a constitution 
and propose it to the people in a mass vote. 

This was what really happened. They looked on helplessly 
while he refashioned the scheme of Sieyes. Keeping the electoral 
machinery almost unchanged (save that the lists of notables 
were to be permanent) Bonaparte entirely altered the upper parts 
of the constitutional pyramid reared by the philosopher. Improv- 
ing upon the procedure of the Convention in Vendemiaire 1795* 
Bonaparte procured the nomination of three consuls in an 
article of the new constitution; they were Bonaparte (First 
Consul), Cambacires and Lebrun. The latter two, uniting with 
I the two retiring consuls, Sieyes and Ducos, were to form the 



NAPOLEON I. 



197 






nucleus of the senate and choose the majority among its full 
complement of sixty members, the minority being thereafter 
chosen by co-optation. To the senate, thus chosen " from 
above/' was allotted the important task of supervising the 
constitution, and of selecting, from among the notabilities of 
the nation, the members of the Corps Ugislatif and the Tribunate. 
These two bodies nominally formed the legislature, the Tribunate 
merely discussing the bills sent to it by an important body, the 
Council of State; while the Corps Ugislatif, sitting in silence, 
heard them defended by councillors of state and criticized by 
members of the Tribunate; thereupon it passed or rejected 
such proposals by secret voting. Thus, the initiative in law- 
making lay with the Council of State; but, as its members were 
all chosen by the First Consul, it is clear that that important 
duty was vested really in him. The executive powers were 
placed almost entirely in his hands, as will be seen by the terms of 
article 41 which defined his functions: " The First Consul 
promulgates the laws; he appoints and dismisses at will the 
members of the Council of State, the ministers, the ambassadors 
and other leading agents serving abroad, the officers of the army 
and navy, the members of local administrative bodies and the 
commissioners of government attached to the tribunals. He 
names all the judges for criminal and civil cases, other than the 
juges de paix (magistrates) and the judges of the Cour de cassation, 
without having the power to discharge them." — As for the second 
and third consuls, their functions were almost entirely con- 
sultative and formal, their opposition being recorded, but 
having no further significance against the fiat of the First Consul. 
Bonaparte's powers were subsequently extended in the years 
1802, 1804 and 1807; but it is clear that autocracy was prac- 
tically established by his own action in the secret commission 
of 1799. The new constitution was promulgated on the 15th of 
December 1799 and in a plebiscite held during January 1800 it 
received the support of 3,011,007 voters, only 1562 persons 
voting against it. The fact that the three new consuls had 
entered upon office and set the constitutional machinery in 
motion fully six weeks before the completion of the plebiscite, 
detracts somewhat from the impressiveness of the vox populi 
on that occasion. 

Bonaparte selected his ministers with much skill. They were 
Talleyrand, Foreign Affairs; Berthier, War; Abrial, Justice; 
Luden Bonaparte, Interior; Gaudin, Finance; Forfait, Navy 
and Colonies. Maret became secretary of state to the consuls. 
Bonaparte's selection gave general satisfaction, as also did the 
personnel of the Council of State (divided into five sections for 
the chief spheres of government) and of the other organs of state. 
Many of the furious Terrorists now became quiet and active 
councillors or administrators, the First Consul adopting the plan 
of multiplying " places," of overwhelming all officials with work, 
and of busying the watch-dogs of the Jacobinical party by 
" throwing them bones to gnaw." 

In our survey of the career of Napoleon, we have now reached 
the time of the Consulate (November 1790-May 1804), whichr 
marks the zenith of his mental powers and creative activity. 
Externally, and in a personal sense, the period falls into two 
parts. The former of these extends to August 1802, when the 
powers of the First Consul, which had been decreed for ten years, 
were prolonged to the duration of his life. But in another and 
wider sense the Consulate has a well-defined unity; it is the 
time when France gained most of her institutions and the essentials 
of her machinery of government. 

The reader is referred to the article France {Law and Institutions) 
for the information respecting the various codes dating from this* 
period, and to the article Concordat for the famous measure 
whereby Napoleon re-established official relations between the state 
and the church in France. More pressing even than that question 
was the regulation of local government. Bonaparte's action in this 
matter was so characteristic as to deserve close attention. Un- 
doubtedly the question was one of great importance; for local affairs 
had fallen into chaos. The aim of the constituent assembly in its 
departmental system (1789-1700) had been to vest local affairs 
ultimately in councils elected by universal suffrage, alike in the 
department and in the three smaller areas within it. These councils 
B ui t ^ ie execut * ve officers dependent on them soon proved to be un- 
able to manage even local affairs efficiently, while they were very 



lax in the collection of the national taxes unwisely entrusted to them. 
Lack of central control over the virtually independent communes 
(over forty thousand in number) led to a sharp rebound under the 
Convention, when all matters of importance were disposed of by 
commissioners appointed by that body. The relations between 
national and local authorities fluctuated considerably during the 
Directory; and it is noteworthy that the constitution of December 
1 799 placed local administration merely under the control of ministers 
at Paris. Everything, therefore, portended a change in this sphere, 
but few persons expected a change so drastic as that which Bonaparte 
now brought about in the measure of 28 Pluvidse, year VIII. (16th 
of February 1800). Certainly no measure marked more clearly the 
abandonment of democratic ideals. The powers formerly vested in 
elective bodies werenow to be wielded by prefects and sub-prefects, 
nominated by the First Consul and responsible to him. The elective 
councils for the department and for the arrondissement (a new area 
which replaced the " districts " of the year 1795) continued to exist, 
but they sat only for a fortnight in the year and had to deal mainly 
with the assessment of taxes for their respective areas. They might 
be consulted by the prefect or sub-prefect; but they had no hold 
over _ him. The municipal councils had^ slightly larger powers, 
relating to loans, octrois, &c. But the chief municipal officer, the 
mayor, was chosen by the prefect. The police of all towns containing 
more than 100,000 inhabitants was controlled by the central 
government. 

It is significant that Bonaparte proposed this bill (drafted in the 
Council of State) to the Tribunate and the Corps Ugislatif on the 
very day on which it was first certainly known that France had 
accepted the new constitution. The opposition in the Tribunate 
was sharp, but was paralysed by the knowledge of the fact just 
named and by the lack of a free press. The bill passed there by 
71 votes to 25; and in the Corps Ligislatif by 217 to 68. The 
acquiescence of these bodies in the transition to despotic methods 
predisposed the public to a similar attitude of mind. At first the 
sharpness of the change was not fully apparent owing to the tactful 
choice of prefects made by the First Consul; but before long their 
very extensive powers were seen to form an important part of the 
new machinery of autocracy. In this connexion we may note that 
the disturbances, mainly royalist but sometimes Jacobinical, in 
several districts of France enabled Bonaparte to propose the estab- 
lishment in the troubled districts of special tribunals for the trial of 
all offences tending to disturb the general peace. Here again the 
Tribunate offered a vehement opposition to the measure, and in 
spite of official pressure passed the bill only by a majority of eight. 
Becoming law on 18 Pluvi6se, year IX. (6th of February 1801), it 
enabled the government to supersede the ordinary judicial machinery 
for political offences in no # fewer than thirty-two departments. 

Bonaparte signalized his tenure of power by no very important 
developments in the sphere of elementary education. This was left 
to the local authorities, and led to little result. _ The more advanced 
schools, known as icoles centrales, were reconstituted either as icoles 
secondares or as lycies by the law of the 30th of April 1802. The 
former of these were designed for the completion of the training of 
the most promising pupils in the communal elementary schools, 
and were left to local control or even to management by private 
individuals. Far more important, however, were the lycies, where 
an excellent education was imparted, semi-military in form and 
under the control of government. It gained valuable powers' of 
patronage by founding 6400 exhibitions {bourses) in connexion with 
the lyc6es; 2400 of which were reserved for the sons of soldiers and 
government officials. The same centralizing tendency is strongly 
marked in the organization of the university of France, the general 
principle of which was set forth in May 1806, while the details were 
arranged by that of March the 17th, 1808. It was designed to control 
all the educational institutions of France, both public and private; 
and it did so with two exceptions, the Museum and the College de 
France. The discipline was strict. Fidelity to the emperor and to 
the teaching of the Roman Catholic doctrine formed part of the aims 
of this comprehensive corporation. Its officers were required to 
obey " the statutes of the teaching body, which have for their object 
uniformity of instruction, and^ which tend^ to form for the state 
citizens attached to their religion, their prince, their country and 
their family." These words sufficiently illustrate the essentially 
political character of the institution. Its organization was com- 
pleted by the decree of the 15th of November 181 1. Napoleon's 
ideas on the education of girls may be judged by this extract from 
his speech at the Council of State on the 1st of March 1806: " I 
do not think that we need trouble ourselves with any plan of in- 
struction for young females: they cannot be better brought up than 
by their mothers. Public education is not suitable for them, because 
they are never called upon to act in public. Manners are all in all 
to them, and marriage is all they look to." 

Returning to the period of the Consulate, we notice the founding 
of an institution which also had its complete development during 
the Empire, namely, the Legion of Honour (19th of May 1802). 
Napoleon intended it as a protest against the spirit of equality 
which pervaded revolutionary thought. In one respect the new 
institution marked an enormous advance on titles of nobility, which 
had been granted nearly always for warlike exploits, or merely 
as a mark of the favour of the sovereign. The First Consul, on the 



198 



NAPOLEON I. 



other hand, sought to recognize and reward merit in all walks of life. 
Nevertheless his proposal met with strong opposition in the Corps 
Ligislatif and Tribunate, where members saw that it portended 
a revival of the older distinction. This was so: abolished in 1790 
by the constituent assembly, titles of nobility were virtually restored 
by Napoleon in 1806 and legally in 1808. Side by side with them 
there continued to exist the Legion of Honour. It was organized 
in fifteen cohorts, each comprising seven grand officers, twenty com- 
manders, thirty officers and 350 legionaries. A stipend, ranging 
from 5000 francs a year to 250 francs, was attached to each grade of 
the institution. The benefits attaching to membership and the 
number of the members were increased during the Empire, when the 
average number somewhat exceeded thirty thousand. Napoleon 's 
aim of bidding for the support of all able men is disagreeably promi- 
nent in all details of this institution, which may be looked upon as 
the tangible outcome of the conviction which he thus frankly ex- 
pressed: "In ambition is to be found the chief motive-force of 
humanity; and a man puts forth his best powers in proportion to 
his hopes of advancement." 

The success of Bonaparte in reorganizing Francemay be ascribed 
to his determined practicality and to his perception of the needs 
of the average man. Since the death of Mirabeau no one had 
appeared who could strike the happy mean and enforce his will on 
the extremes on either side. Bonaparte did so with a forcefulness 
rarely possessed by that usually mediocre creature, the moderate 
man. 

It is time now to notice the chief events which ensured the 
ascendancy of Bonaparte. Military, diplomatic and police affairs 
were skilfully made to conduce to that result. In the first of 
these spheres the victory of Marengo (14th of June 1800) was of 
special importance, as it consolidated the reputation of Bonaparte 
at a time when republican opposition was gathering strength. As 
Lucien Bonaparte remarked, if Marengo had been lost — and it 
was saved only by Desaix and Kellermann — the Bonaparte 
family would have been proscribed. Negotiations for peace now 
followed; but they led to nothing, until Moreau's triumph at 
Hohcnlinden (December 2nd, 1800) brought the court of Vienna 
to a state of despair. By the treaty with Austria, signed by 
Joseph Bonaparte at Luneville on the 9th of February 1801, 
France regained all that she had won at Campo Formio, much 
of which had been lost for a time in the war of the Second Coali- 
tion. True, she now agreed to recognise the independence of the 
Cisalpine, Ligurian, Helvetic and Batavian (Dutch) republics; 
but the masterful acquisitiveness of the First Consul and the 
weak conduct of Austrian and British affairs at that time soon 
made that clause of the treaty a dead letter. Bonaparte mean- 
while, by dexterous behaviour to Paul I. of Russia, had won 
the friendship of that potentate, whose resentment against his 
former allies, Austria and England, facilitated a re-grouping of 
the Powers. The new Franco-Russian entente helped on the 
formation of the Armed Neutrality League and led to the con- 
coction of schemes for the driving of the British" from India. 
But these undertakings were thwarted in March-April 1801 by 
the murder of the tsar Paul and by Nelson's victory at Copen- 
hagen. The advent of the more peaceful and Anglophile tsar, 
Alexander I. (g.v.), brought about the dissolution of the League, 
and the abandonment of the oriental schemes which Bonaparte 
had so closely at heart. Another disappointment befel him irt the 
same quarter, the surrender of the French forces in Egypt to 
the British expedition commanded first by General Abercromby 
and afterwards by General John Hely-Hutchinson (30th *of 
August 1801). 

These events disposed both Bonaparte and the British cabinet 
towards peace. He was all powerful on land, they on the sea; 
and for the present each was powerless to harm the » other. 
Bonaparte in particular discerned the advantages which peace 
would bring in the consolidation of his position. The beginning 
of negotiations had been somewhat facilitated by the resignation 
. of Pitt (4th of February 1801) and the advent to office of Henry; 
Addington. Bonaparte, perceiving the weakness of Addington, 
both as a man and as a minister, pressed him hard; and both the 
Preliminaries of Peace, concluded at London on the 1st of October 
1801, and the terms of the treaty of Amiens (27th of March 1803) 
were such as to spread through the United Kingdom a feeling of v 
annoyance. In everything which related to the continent of 
Europe and to the resumption of trade relations between Great 
Britain and France, Bonaparte had his way; and he abated 



his demands only in a few questions relating to India and New- 
foundland. 

The terms of the treaty of Amiens may be thus summarized: 
Great Britain restored to France the colonial possessions (almost 
the whole of the French colonial empire) conquered in the late 
war. Of their many maritime conquests the British retained 
only the Spanish island of Trinidad and the Dutch settlements 
in Ceylon. Their other conquests at the expense of these allies 
of France were restored to them, including the Cape of Good 
Hope to the Dutch. France recognized the integrity of the 
Turkish Empire and promised an indemnity to the House of 
Orange exiled from the Batavian (Dutch) Republic since 1704. 
She further agreed to evacuate the papal states, Taranto and 
other towns in the Mediterranean coasts which she had occupied. 
The independence of the Ionian Isles (now reconstituted as the 
Republic of the Seven Islands) was guaranteed. As to Malta, 
the United Kingdom was to restore it to the order of St John 
(its possessors previous to 1798) when the Great Powers had 
guaranteed its independence. It was to receive a Neapolitan 
garrison for a year, and, if necessary, for a longer time. 

No event in the life of Bonaparte was more auspicious than the 
conclusion of this highly advantageous bargain. By retaining 
nearly all the continental conquests of France, and by recovering 
every one of those which the British had made at her expense 
beyond the seas, he achieved a feat which was far beyond the 
powers even of Louis XIV. The gratitude of the French for 
this triumph found expression in a proposal, emanating from the 
Tribunate, that the First Consul should receive a pledge of the 
gratitude of the nation. When referred to the senate, the 
matter underwent secret manipulation, largely through the in- 
fluence of Cambaceres; but the republican instinct even in the 
senate was sufficiently strong to thwart the intrigues of the second 
consul; and that body on the 8th of May merely re-elected 
Bonaparte for a second term of ten years after the expiration 
of the first decennial term for which he was chosen. This fell 
far short of his desires, and he now dexterously referred the 
whole question to the nation at large. The Council of State, 
acting on a suggestion made by Cambaceres, now intervened with 
telling effect. It altered the wording of the senatorial proposal 
in such a way that the nation was asked to vote on the question: 
" Is Napoleon Bonaparte to be made Consul for Life ? " France 
responded by an overwhelming affirmative, 3,568,885 votes being 
cast for the proposal and only 8374 against it. 

Napoleon (who now used his Christian name instead of the 
surname Bonaparte) thereupon sent proposals for various changes 
in the constitution, which were at once registered by the obsequious 
Council of State and the Senate on the 4th of August (16 Ther- 
midor) 1802. Besides holding his powers for life, he now gained 
the right of nominating his successor. He alone could ratify 
treaties of peace and alliance, and on his nomination fifty-four 
senators were added to the senate, which thereafter numbered 
one hundred and twenty members appointed by him alone. 
This body received the right of deciding by senatus consulta all 
questions not provided for by the constitution; the Corps 
JJgislatif and Tribunate might also thenceforth be dissolved at 
its bidding. In short, the First Consul now became the irre- 
sponsible ruler of France, governing the country through the 
ministry, the Council of State and the Senate. As for the 
chambers, based avowedly on universal suffrage, their existence 
thenceforth was ornamental or sepulchral. The constitutional 
changes of August 1802, initiated solely by "Bonaparte, made 
France an absolute monarchy. The name of Empire was not 
adopted until nearly two years later; but the change then 
brought about was scarcely more than titular. 

In order to understand the utter inability of the old republican 
party to withstand these changes, it is needful to retrace our steps 
and consider the skilful use made by Bonaparte of plots and disturb- 
ances as they occurred. As was natural, when he sought to steer a 
middle course between the Scylla of royalism and 'the Charybdis of 
Jacobinism, disturbances were to be expected on both sides" of the 
consular ship of state. The first of these was an unimportant affair, 
probably nursed by the agents provocateurs of Fouche's ubiquitous 
police. It purported to be an undertaking entered into by a few 



NAPOLEON I. 



199 



Jacobins, among them Arena, a Corsican, for the murder of Bona- 
parte at the opera. Ar6na and his supposed accomplice were arrested 
(10th of October 1800); and that was virtually the beginning and 
the end of the plot. Far more serious was the danger to be appre- 
hended from the royalists. Enraged by Bonaparte's contemptuous 
refusal to encourage the return of" Louis XVIII." to his own, the 
royalists began to compass the death of the man whom they had at 
first naively looked on as a potential General Monk to their Charles II. 
Their chief man of action was a sturdy Breton peasant, Georges 
Cadoudal, whose zeal and courage served to bring to a head plans 
long talked over by the confidants of the Comte d'Artois (the future 
Charles X. of France) in London. The outcome of it was the des- 
patch of some five or six Chouan desperadoes to Paris, three of whom 
exploded an infernal machine close to Bonaparte's carriage in the 
narrow streets near the Tuileries (3rd Niv6se [24th of December] 
1800). Bonaparte and Josephine escaped uninjured, but several 
bystanders were killed or wounded. Napoleon's vengeance at once 
took a strongly practical turn. Despite the evidence which Fouche 
and others brought forward to incriminate the royalists^ the First 
Consul persisted in attributing the outrage to the Jacobins, had a 
list of suspects drawn up, and caused the Council of State to declare 
that a special precautionary measure was necessary. The measure 
proved to be the deportation of the leading Jacobins; and a cloak 
of legality was cast over this extraordinary proceeding by a special 
decree of the senate (avowedly the guardian of the constitution) 
that this act of the government was a " measure tending to preserve 
the constitution " (5th of January 1801). The body charged with 
the guarding of the constitution was thus brought by Bonaparte 
to justify its violation; and a way was thus opened for the legalizing 
of further irregularities. For the present the connivance of the 
senate at his coup d'itat of Niv6se led to the deportation of one 
hundred and thirty Jacobins; some were interned in the islands of 
the Bay of Biscay, while fifty were sent to the tropical colonies of 
France, whence few of them ever returned. It is to be observed that, 
before the punishment was inflicted, evidence was forthcoming which 
brought home the outrage of Niv6se to the royalists; but this was 
all one to Bonaparte; his aim was to destroy the Jacobin party, 
and it never recovered from the blow. The party which had set up 
the Committee of Public Safety was now struck down by the very 
man who through the Directory inherited by direct lineal descent 
the dictatorial powers instituted in the spring of 1793 forthe salva- 
tion of the republic. It remains to add that the suspects in the plot 
of October 1800 were now guillotined (31st of January 1801), and 
that two of the plotters closely connected with the affair of Niv6se 
were also executed (21st of April). The institution of the special 
tribunals (already referred to), which enabled Bonaparte to supersede 
local government in thirty-two of the departments, was another 
outcome of the bomb conspiracy. 

Far more lenient was Bonaparte's conduct towards a knot of dis- 
contented officers who, in April-May 1802, framed a clumsy plot, 
known as the "Plot of the Placards," for arousing the soldiery 
against him. He disgraced or imprisoned the ringleaders, ordered 
Bernadotte (perhaps the fountain head of the whole affair) to take 
the waters at Plombi&res and drove from office Fouch6, who had 
sought to screen the real offenders by impugning the royalists. 

Bonaparte's action in the years 1 800-1 802 showed that he feared 
the old republican party far more than the royalists. In April 1802 
he procured the passing of a senatus consultum granting increased 
facilities for the return of the Smigres; with few exceptions they were 
allowed to return, provided that it was before the 2^rd of September 
1802, and, after swearing to obey the new constitution, they entered 
into possession of their lands which had not been alienated; but 
barriers were raised against the recovery of their confiscated lands. 
Very many accepted these terms, rallied to the First Consul with 
more or less sincerity; and their return to ]F ranee to strengthen 
the conservative elements in French society. The promulgation of 
the Concordat (18th of April 1802) and the institution of what was 
in all but name a state religion tended strongly in the same direction, 
the authority of the priests being generally used in support of the 
man to whom Chateaubriand applied the epithet " restorer of the 
altars." Nevertheless, despite Bonaparte's marvellous skill in 
rallying moderate men of all parties^ to .his side, there remained 
an unconvinced and desperate minority, whose clumsy procedure 
enabled the great engineer to hoist them with their own petard 
and to raise himself to the imperial dignity. But before referring 
to this last proof of the Machiavellian skill of the great Corsican in 
dealing with plots, it is needful to notice the events which brought 
him into collision with the British nation. 

The treaty of Amiens had contained germs which ensured its 
dissolution at no distant date; but even more serious was the 
conduct of Bonaparte after the conclusion of peace. He carried 
matters with so high a hand in the affairs of Holland, Switzerland 
and Italy as seriously to diminish the outlets for British trade in 
Europe. His action in the matters just named, as also in the 
complex affair of the secularizations of clerical domains in 
Germany (February 1803), belongs properly to the history of 
those countries; but we may here note that, even before the 



signature of the .peace of Amiens (27th of March 1802), he had 
effected changes in the constitution of the Batavian (Dutch) 
republic, which placed power in the hands of the French party 
and enabled him to keep French troops in the chief Dutch 
fortresses, despite the recently signed treaty of Luneville which 
guaranteed the independence of that republic. His treatment 
of the Italians was equally high-handed. In September 1801 he 
bestowed on the Cisalpine republic a constitution modelled on 
that of France. Next, he summoned the chief men of the Franco- 
phile party in that republic to Lyons in the early days of 1802, 
in order to arrange with them the appointment of the chiefs of 
the executive. It soon appeared that the real aim of the meeting 
was to make Bonaparte president. He let it be known that 
he strongly disapproved of their proposal to elect Count Melzi, 
the Italian statesman most suitable for the post; and a hint 
given by Talleyrand showed the reason for his disapproval. 
The deputies thereupon elected Bonaparte. As for the neighbour- 
ing land, Piedmont, it was already French in all but name. On 
the 21st of April 1801 he issued a decree which constituted 
Piedmont as a military district dependent on France; for 
various reasons he postponed the final act of incorporation to 
the 21 st of September 1802. The Genoese republic a little earlier 
underwent at his hand changes which made its doge all-powerful 
in local affairs, but a mere puppet in the hands of Bonaparte. 
In central Italy the influence of the First Consul was paramount; 
for in 1 801 he transformed the grand duchy of Tuscany into the 
kingdom of Etruria for the duke of Parma; and, seeing that that 
promotion added lustre to the fortunes of the duchess of Parma 
(a Spanish infanta), Spain consented lamely enough to the cession 
of Louisiana to France. The effect of these extraordinary 
changes, then, was the carrying out of Napoleonic satrapies in 
the north and centre of Italy in a way utterly inconsistent with 
the treaty of Luneville; and the weakness with which the courts 
of London and Vienna looked on at these singular events con- 
firmed Bonaparte in the belief that he could do what he would 
with neighbouring states. The policy of the French revolutionists 
had been to surround France with free and allied republics. The 
policy of the First Consul was to transform them into tributaries 
which copied with chameleonic fidelity the political fashions he 
himself set at Paris. 

Of all these interventions the most justifiable and beneficent, 
perhaps, was that which related to the Swiss cantons. Whether 
his agents did, or did not, pour oil on the flames of civil strife, 
which he thereupon quenched by his Act of Mediation, 19th of 
February 1803, is a complex question. The settlement which 
he thereby imposed was in many ways excellent; but it was 
dearly purchased by the complete ascendancy of Bonaparte 
in all important affairs, and by the claim for the services of a 
considerable contingent of Swiss troops which he thereafter 
rigorously enforced. 

The re-occupation of Switzerland by French troops in October 
1802 wrought English opinion to a state of indignation against 
the autocrat who was making conquests more quickly in time 
of peace than he had done by his sword; and the irritation 
increased when, on the 29th of January 1803, he publicly stated: 
" It is recognized by Europe that Italy and Holland, as well as 
Switzerland, are at the disposal of France." Another act of 
his at that time made still more strongly for war. On the 30th 
of January he caused the official French paper, the Moniteur, 
to publish in extenso a confidential report sent by Colonel 
Sebastiani describing his so-called commercial mission to the 
Levant. In it there occurred the threatening phrase: " Six 
thousand French would at present be enough to conquer Egypt." 
An equally significant hint, that the Ionian Isles might easily 
be regained by France, further helped to open the eyes of the 
purblind Addington ministry to the resolve of Napoleon to make 
the Mediterranean a French lake. Ministers were also deeply 
concerned at the continued occupation of Holland by French 
troops, which made that country and, therefore, the Cape of 
Good Hope, absolutely dependent on France. They accordingly 
resolved not to give up Malta unless Lord Whitworth, the British 
ambassador at Paris, " received z satisfactory explanation "

relative to the Sebastiani report. Napoleon's refusal to give this, 
and his complaint that Great Britain had neglected to comply 
with some of the provisions of the treaty of Amiens, brought 
Anglo-French relations to an acute phase. By great dexterity 
he succeeded in turning public attention almost solely to the 
fact that Britain had not evacuated Malta. This is probably 
the sense in which we may interpret his tirade against Lord 
Whit worth at the diplomatic circle on the 13th of March. While 
not using threats of personal violence, as was generally reported 
at the time, his language was threatening and offensive. Annoyed 
by Whitworth's imperturbable demeanour, he ended with these 
words: " You must respect treaties, then: woe to those who do 
not respect treaties. They shall answer for it to all Europe." 
The news of the strengthening of the British army and navy 
lately announced in the king's speech had perhaps annoyed him; 
but seeing that his outbursts of passion were nearly always the 
result of calculation — he once stated, pointing to his chin, that 
temper only mounted that high with him — his design, doubtless, 
was to set men everywhere talking about the perfidy of Albion. 
If so, he succeeded. His own violations of the treaties of Lun6ville 
and Amiens were overlooked; and in particular men forgot 
that the weakening of the Knights of St John by the recent 
confiscation of their lands in France and Spain, and the pro- 
tracted delay of Russia and Prussia to guarantee their tenure 
of power in Malta, furnished England with good reasons for 
keeping her hold on that island. On the 4th of April the 
Addington cabinet made proposals with a view to compensation. 
In return for the great accessions of power to France since the 
treaty of Amiens (Elba, it may be noted, was annexed in August 
1802) Great Britain was to retain Malta for ten years and to 
acquire the small island of Lampedusa in perpetuity. French 
troops were also required to withdraw from Holland and Switzer- 
land, and thus fulfil the terms of the treaty of Luneville. Despite 
the urgent efforts of Joseph Bonaparte and Talleyrand to bend 
the First Consul, he refused to listen to these proposals. Finally, 
on the 7th of May, the British government sent a secret offer 
to withdraw from Malta as soon as the French evacuated Holland. 
To this also Napoleon demurred. The rupture, therefore, took 
place in the middle of May; and on a flimsy pretext the First 
Consul ordered the detention in France of all English persons. 
The reasons for his annoyance are now well known. It is 
certain that he was preparing to renew the struggle for the 
mastery of the seas and of the Orient, which must break out 
if he held to his present resolve to found a great colonial empire. 
But he needed time in order to build a navy and to prepare for 
the execution of the schemes for the overthrow of the British 
power in India, which he had lately outlined to General Decaen, 
the new governor of the French possessions in that land. The 
sailing of Decaen 's squadron early in March 1803 had alarmed 
the British ministers and doubtless confirmed their resolve to 
have the question of peace or war settled speedily. Whitworth 
also warned them on the 20th of April that " the chief motives 
for delay are that they (the French) are totally unprepared for a 
naval war." This was quite correct. Napoleon wished to post- 
pone the rupture for fully eighteen months, as is shown by his 
secret instructions to Decaen. The British government did not 
know the whole truth; but, knowing the character of Napoleon, 
it saw that peace was as dangerous as war. In any case, it sent 
the proposals of the 4th of April in order to test the sincerity of 
his recent offer of compensation to England. He refused them, 
mainly, it would seem, because he could not believe that the 
Addington ministry could be firm; and in his rage at the dis- 
covery of his error he revenged himself ignobly on British 
tourists and traders in France. 

_ He now threw all his energies into the task of marshalling the 
forces of France and his vassal states for the overthrow of 
" perfidious Albion." Naval preparations went on apace at 
all the dockyards, and numbers of flat-bottomed boats were 
built or repaired at the northern harbours. Disregarding the 
neutrality of the Germanic System, Napoleon sent a strong 
French corps to overrun Hanover, while he despatched General 
Gouvion St Cyr to occupy Taranto and other dominating 



positions in the south-east of the kingdom of Naples. Exactions 
at the expense of Hanover and Naples helped to lighten the 
burdens of French finance; Napoleon's sale of Louisiana to 
the United States early in 1803 for 60,000,000 francs brought 
further relief to the French treasury; and by pressing hard on 
his ally, Spain, he compelled her to exchange the armed help 
which he had a right to claim, for an annual suhsidy of £2,880,000. 
Through Spain he then threatened Portugal with extinction 
unless she too paid a heavy subsidy, a demand with which the 
court of Lisbon was fain to comply. 

Thus the first months of the war served to differentiate the 
two belligerents. England made short work of the French 
squadrons and colonies, particularly in the West Indies, while 
Napoleon became more than ever the master of central and 
southern Europe. The whole course of the war was to emphasize 
this distinction between the Sea Power and the Land Power; 
and in this fact lay the source of Napoleon's ascendancy in France 
and neighbouring lands, as also of his final overthrow. 

Napoleon's utter disregard of the neutrality of neighbouring 
states was soon to be revealed in the course of a royalist plot 
which helped him to the imperial title. Georges Cadoudal, 
General Pichegru and other devoted royalists had concocted 
with the comte d'Artois (afterwards Charles X. of France) in 
London a scheme for the kidnapping (or more probably the 
murder) of the First Consul. The French police certainly knew 
of the plot, allowed the conspirators to come to Paris, arrested 
them there, and also on the 16th of February 1804 General 
Moreau, with whom Pichegru had two or three secret conferences. 
This was much; for Moreau, though indolent and incapable in 
political affairs, was still immensely popular in the army (always 
more republican than the civilians) and might conceivably head 
a republican movement against the autocrat. But far more was 
to follow. Failing through his police to lure the comte d'Artois 
to land in Normandy, Napoleon pounced on a scion of the House 
of Bourbon who was within his reach. The young due d'Enghien 
was then residing at Ettenheim in Baden near the bank of the 
Rhine. He had served in the army of his grandfather, the prince 
of Conde, during the recent war; and Bonaparte believed for 
a time that he was an accomplice to the Cadoudal-Pichegru plot. 
He therefore sent orders to have him seized by French soldiers 
and brought to Vincennes near Paris. The order was skilfully 
obeyed, and the prince was hurried before a court-martial hastily 
summoned at that castle. Before they passed the verdict, 
Napoleon came to see that his victim was innocent of any 
participation in the plot. Nevertheless he was executed (21st 
of March 1804). It is noteworthy that though Napoleon at 
times sought to shift the responsibility for this deed on Talleyrand 
or Savary, yet during his voyage to St Helena, as also in his will, 
he frankly avowed his responsibility for it and asserted that in 
the like circumstances he would do the same again. 

The horror aroused by this crime did not long deaden the feeling, 
at least in official circles, that something must be done to intro- 
duce the principle of heredity, as the surest means of counteract- 
ing the aims of conspirators. The senate, as usual, took the 
lead in suggesting some such change in the constitution; and 
it besought Napoleon " to complete his work by rendering it, like 
his glory, immortal." Other official addresses of the same 
general tenour flowed in; and even the trihunate showed its 
docility by proposing that the imperial dignity should be declared 
hereditary in the family of Bonaparte (3rd of May). Napoleon 
thereupon invited the senate to " make known to him its thoughts 
completely." The senate and the tribunate each appointed a 
commission to deal with the matter, with the result which every 
one foresaw. Carnot alone in the tribunate protested against 
the measure. The other councils adopted it almost unanimously. 
The S mains Consultum of the 18th of May 1804 awarded to 
Napoleon the title of emperor, the succession (in case he had no 
heir) devolving in turn upon the descendants of Joseph and 
Louis Bonaparte (Lucien and Jerome were for the present ex- 
cluded from the succession owing to their having contracted 
marriages displeasing to Napoleon). In a plebiscite taken on the 
subject of the imperial title and the law of succession, there were

3,572,329 affirmative votes and only 2560 negatives. In this vote 
lay the justification of the acts of the First Consul and the pledge 
for the greatness of the emperor Napoleon. The republicans 
in nearly every case voted for him: and it is significant of the 
curious trend of French thought that the new imperial con- 
stitution of the 18th of May 1804 opened with the words: 
" The government of the Republic is confided to an emperor, 
who takes the title Emperor of the French." 

The changes brought about by this constitution were mainly 
titular. Napoleon's powers as First Consul for Life were^ so wide 
as to render much extension both superfluous and impossible; but 
we may note here that the senate now gained a further accession 
of authority at the expense of the two legislative bodies: and 
practically legislation rested with the emperor, who sent his decrees 
10 the senate to be registered as senatus consulta. Napoleon's chief 
aversion, the tribunate, was also divided into three sections, dealing 
with legislation, home affairs and finance — a division which preluded 
its entire suppression in 1807. More important were the titular 
changes Napoleon, as we have seen, did not venture to create an 
order of nobility until 1808, but he at once established an imperial 
hierarchy. First came the French princes, namely, the brothers of 
the emperor; six grand imperial dignities were also instituted, viz. 
those of the grand elector (Joseph Bonaparte), arch-chancellor of the 
empire (CambacSr&s), arch-chancellor of state (Eup^ne de Beau- 
harnais), arch-treasurer (Lebrun), constable (Louis Bonaparte), 
grand admiral (Murat). These six formed the emperor's grand 
council. Next came the marshals, namely, Berthier, Murat, Mass^na, 
Augereau, Lannes, Jourdan, Ney, Soult, Brune, Davout, Bessieres, 
Moncey, Mortier and Bernadotte. Four generals — Kellermann, 
Lefebvre, P£rignon, Serrurier — received the titles of honorary- 
marshals. Next came dignities of a slightly lower rank, such as 
those of grand almoner (Fesch), grand marshal of the palace (Duroc), 
grand chamberlain (Talleyrand), grand master of the horse (Caulain- 
court), grand huntsman (Berthier), grand master of ceremonies 
(S6gur). These with a host of lesser dignities built up the imperial 
hierarchy and enabled the court quickly to develop on the lines of 
the old monarchy, so far as rules of etiquette and self-conscious 
efforts could reproduce the courtly graces of the ancien regime. 

Meanwhile Napoleon was triumphing overthe last of the republican 
generals. Moreau's trial for treason promised to end with an ac- 
quittal; but the emperor brought severe pressure to bear on the 
judges (one of whom he dismissed), with the result that the general 
was declared guilty of participating in the royalist plot. Thereupon 
Napoleon, in order to grace the new rSgime by an act of clemency, 
pardoned Moreau, it being understood that he must leave France. 
He left immediately for the United States. Sentence of death was 
passed on the royalist conspirators. On Josephine's entreaties, the 
emperor commuted the sentence for eight of the well-connected men 
among them ; Cadoudal and others of lower extraction were executed 
on the 24th of June. The brave Breton peasant thus summed up 
the results of his plot: " We meant to giveFrance a king and we 
have given her an emperor." The mot was literally true. Victories 
in the field were not more effective in consolidating Napoleon's 
power than were his own coups d'&tat and the supremely skilful use 
which he made of conspiracies directed against him. He showed his 
sense of the value of Fouch6's services in exploiting the royalist 
plot of 1803-1804 by reconstituting the ministry of police and bestow- 
ing it upon him. Thenceforth plots were few. Would-be plotters 
remained quiet from sheer terror of his power and ability, or from a 
conviction that conspiracies redounded to his advantage. 

Napcleon was now able by degrees to dispense with all re- 
publican forms (the last to go was the Republican Calendar, 
which ceased on the 1st of January 1806), and the scene at the 
coronation in Notre Dame on the 2nd of December 1804 was 
frankly imperial in splendour and in the egotism which led 
Napoleon to wave aside the pope, Pius VII., at the supreme 
moment and ciown himself. It is worthy of note that Josephine 
then won a triumph over Joseph Bonaparte and his sisters, 
who had been intriguing to effect a divorce. Napoleon, though 
he did not bar the door absolutely against such a proceeding, 
granted her her heart's desire by secretly going through a religious 
ceremony on the evening before the coronation. It was performed 
by Fesch, now a cardinal; but Napoleon could afterwards urge 
the claim that all the legal formalities had not teen complied 
with; and the motive for the marriage may probably be found 
in the refusal of the pope to appear at the coronation unless the 
former civil contract was replaced by the religious rite. 

As happened at every stage of Napoleon's advancement, 
the states tributary to France underwent changes corresponding 
to those occurring at Paris. The most important of these was 
the erection of monarchy in North Italy. The Italian repuhlic 
(formerly the Cisalpine republic) became the kingdom of Italy. 



At first Napoleon desired to endow Joseph, or, on his refusal, 
Louis, with the crown of the new kingdom. They, however, 
refused to place themselves out of the line of direct succession 
in France, as Napoleon required, in case they accepted this new 
dignity. Finally, he resolved to take the title himself. The 
obsequious authorities at Milan at once furthered his design bv 
sending an address to him, by requesting the establishment of 
royalty, and on the 15th of March 1805 by offering the crown to 
him. On the 26th of May he crowned himself in the cathedral 
at Milan with the iron crown of the old Lombard kings, amidst 
surroundings of the utmost splendour. On the 7th of June 
he issued a decree conferring the dignity of viceroy on Eugene de 
Beauharnais,his stepson; but everything showed that Napoleon's 
will was to be law; and the great powers at once saw that 
Napoleon's promise to keep the crowns of France and Italy separate 
was meaningless. The matter was of international importance; 
for by the treaty of Luneville (February 1801) he had bound 
himself to respect the independence of the two republics of North 
Italy, the Cisalpine and the Ligurian. The defiance to Austria 
was emphasized when, on the 4th of June, he promised a deputa- 
tion from Genoa that he would grant their request (prompted 
by his agents) of incorporating the Genoese (or Ligurian) republic 
in the French empire. In the same month he erected the re- 
public of Lucca into a principality for Bacciochi and his consort, 
Elisa Bonaparte. 

These actions proclaimed so unmistakably Napoleon's in- 
tention of making Italy an annexe of France as to convince 
Francis of Austria and Alexander of Russia that war with him 
was inevitable. The tsar, as protector of the Germanic System, 
had already been so annoyed by the seizure of the due d'Enghien 
on German territory, and by other high-handed actions against 
the Hanse cities, as to recall his ambassador from Paris. 
Napoleon showed his indifference to the opinion of the tsar by 
ordering the seizure of the British envoy at Hamburg, Sir George 
Rumbold (24th of October); but set him free on the remonstrance 
of the king of Prussia, with whom he then desired to remain on 
friendly terms. Nevertheless, the general trend of his policy 
was such as powerfully to help on the formation of the Third 
Coalition against France — a compact which Pitt (who returned 
to power in May 1804) had found it very difficult to arrange. 
Disputes with Russia respecting Malta and the British maritime 
code kept the two states apart for nearly a year; and Austria 
was too timid to move. But Napoleon's actions, especially the 
annexation of Genoa, at last brought the three powers to accord, 
with the general aim of re-establishing the status quo ante in Ger- 
many, Holland, Switzerland and Italy, or, in short, of restoring 
the balance of power which Napoleon had completely upset. 

Military affairs in this period are dealt with under Napoleonic 
Campaigns; but it may be noted here that during the anxious 
days which Napoleon spent at the camp of Boulogne in the 
second and third weeks of August 1805, uncertain whether to 
risk all in an attack on England in case Villeneuve should arrive, 
or to turn the Grand Army against Austria, the only step which 
he took to avert a continental war was the despatch of General 
Duroc to Berlin to offer Hanover to Prussia on consideration of 
her framing a close alliance with France. It was very unlikely 
that that peace-loving Court would take up arms against its 
powerful neighbours on behalf of Napoleon, and his proceedings 
in the previous months had been so recklessly provocative as 
to arouse doubts whether he intended to invade England and 
did not welcome the outbreak of a continental war. But in the 
case of a man so intensely ambitious, determined and egoistic as 
Napoleon, a decision on this interesting question is hazardous. 
Little reliance can be placed on his subsequent statements (as, 
for instance, to Metternich in 1810) that the huge preparations 
at Boulogne and the long naval campaign of Villeneuve were a 
mere ruse whereby to lure the Austrians into a premature 
declaration of war. It is, however, highly probable that he meant 
to strike at London if naval affairs went well, but that he was 
glad to have at hand an alternative which would shroud a 
maritime failure under military laurels. If so, he succeeded. 
His habit was, as he said, faire son theme en deux faqons, and he 



202 



NAPOLEON I. 



now took the second alternative. On or about the 25th-27th 
of August he resolved to strike at Austria. He did so with 
masterly skill and swiftness, and the triumphs of Ulm and 
Austerlitz hid from view the disaster of Trafalgar; and the only 
official reference to that crushing defeat was couched in these 
terms: " Storms caused us to lose some ships of the line after a 
fight imprudently engaged " (speech to the Legislature, 2nd of 
March 1806). 

The glamour of Austerlitz had very naturally dazzled all 
Frenchmen. Its results indeed were not only astounding at the 
time, but were such as to lead up to a new cycle of wars. By 
the peace of Presburg (26th of December 1805) Napoleon com- 
pelled Austria to recognize all the recent changes in Italy, and 
further to cede Venetia, Istria and Dalmatia to the new kingdom 
of Italy. The Swabian lands of the Habsburgs went to the South 
German states (allies of Napoleon), while Bavaria also received 
Tirol and Vorarlberg. The Electors of Bavaria and Wurttem- 
berg were recognized as kings. 

Nor was this all. Napoleon pressed almost equally hard upon 
Prussia. That power had been on the point of offering her 
armed mediation in revenge for his violation of her territory of 
Anspach; but she was fain to accept the terms which he offered 
at the sword's point. When modified in February 1806, after 
Prussia's demobilization, they comprised the occupation of 
Hanover by Prussia, with the proviso, however, that she should 
exclude British ships and goods from the whole of the north- 
west coast of Germany. To this demand (the real commence- 
ment of the " Continental System") the Berlin government had 
to accede, though at the cost of a naval war with England, and the 
ruin of its maritime trade. Anspach and Bayreuth were also 
to be handed over to Bavaria, it now being the aim of Napoleon 
to aggrandize the South German princes who had fought on his 
side in the late war. In order to strengthen this compact, he 
arranged a marriage between the daughter of the king of Bavaria 
and Eugene Beauharnais; and he united the daughter of the 
Elector of Wiirttemberg in marriage to Jerome Bonaparte, who 
had now divorced his wife, formerly Miss Paterson of Baltimore, 
at his brother's behests. Stephanie de Beauharnais, niece of 
Josephine, was also betrothed to the son of the duke (now grand 
duke) of Baden. By these alliances the new Charlemagne 
seemed to have founded his supremacy in South Germany on 
sure foundations. 

Equally striking was his success in Italy. The Bourbons of 
Naples had broken their treaty engagements with Napoleon, 
though in this matter they were perhaps as much sinned against 
as sinning. After Austerlitz the conqueror fulminated against 
them, and sent southwards a strong column which compelled 
an Anglo-Russian force to sail away and brought about the flight 
of the Bourbons to Sicily (February 1806). This event opened 
a new and curious chapter in the history of Europe, that of the 
fortunes of the Napottonides. True to his Corsican instinct of 
attachment to the family, and contempt for legal and dynastic 
claims, he now began to plant his brothers and other relatives 
in what had been republics established by the French Jacobins. 
Eugene Beauharnais had been established at Milan. Joseph 
Bonaparte was now advised to take the throne of Naples, and 
without any undue haggling as to terms, for "those who will 
not rise with me shall no longer be of my family. I am making 
a family of kings attached to my federative system." At the 
end of March 1806 Joseph became king of the Two Sicilies. A 
little later the emperor bestowed the two papal enclaves of 
Benevento and Ponte-Corvo on Talleyrand and Bernadotte 
respectively, an act which emphasized the hostility which had 
been growing between Napoleon and the papacy. Because 
Tius VII. declined to exclude British goods from the Papal 
States, Napoleon threatened to reduce the pope to the level 
merely of bishop of Rome. He occupied Ancona and seemed 
about to annex the Papal States outright. That doom was 
postponed; but Catholics everywhere saw with pain the harsh 
treatment accorded to a defenceless old man. The prestige 
which the First Consul had gained by the Concordat was now lost 
by the overweening emperor. 



But it was on the banks of the Rhine that the Napoleonic 
system received its most signal developments. The duchy of 
Berg, along with the eastern part of Cleves and other annexes, 
now went to Murat, brother-in-law of Napoleon (March 1806); 
and that melodramatic soldier at once began to round off his 
eastern boundary in a way highly offensive to Prussia. She was 
equally concerned by Napoleon's behaviour in the Dutch Nether- 
lands, where her influence used to be supreme. On the 5th of 
June 1806 the Batavian republic completed its chrysalis-like 
transformations by becoming a kingdom for Louis Bonaparte. 
" Never cease to be a Frenchman " was the pregnant advice 
which he gave to his younger brother in announcing the new 
dignity to him. In that sentence lay the secret of all the dis- 
agreements between the two brothers. Louis resolved to govern 
for the good of his subjects. Napoleon determined that he, like 
all the Bonapartist rulers, should act merely as a Napoleonic 
satrap. They were to be to him what the counts of the marches 
were to Charlemagne, warlike feudatories defending the empire 
or overawing its prospective foes. 

Far more was to follow. On the 17th of July Napoleon signed 
at Paris a decree that reduced to subservience the Germanic 
System, the chaotic weakness of which he had in 1797 foreseen 
to be highly favourable to France. He now grouped together the 
princes of south and central Germany in the Confederation of 
the Rhine, of which he was the protector and practically the ruler 
in all important affairs. The logical outcome of this proceeding 
appeared on the 1st of August, when Napoleon declared that he 
no longer recognized the., existence of the Holy Roman Empire. 
The head of that venerable organism, the emperor Francis II., 
bowed to the inevitable and announced that he thenceforth 
confined himself to his functions as Francis I., hereditary emperor 
of Austria, a title which he had taken just two years previously. 
This tame acquiescence of the House of Habsburg in the re- 
organization of Germany seemed to set the seal on Napoleon's 
work. He controlled all the lands from the Elbe to the Pyrenees, 
and had Spain and Italy at his beck and call. Power such as this 
was never wielded by his prototype, Charlemagne. 

But now came a series of events which transcended all that 
the mind of man had conceived. As the summer of 1806 wore 
on, his policy perceptibly hardened. Negotiations with England 
and Russia served to show the extent of his ambition. Sicily 
he was determined to have, and that too despite of all the efforts 
of the Fox-Grenville cabinet to satisfy him in every other direc- 
tion. In his belief that he could ensnare the courts of London 
and St Petersburg into separate and proportionately disadvan- 
tageous treaties, he overreached himself. The tsar indignantly 
repudiated a treaty which his envoy, Oubril, had been tricked 
into signing at Paris; and the Fox-Grenville cabinet (as also 
its successor) refused to bargain away Sicily. War, therefore, 
went on. What was more, Prussia, finding that Napoleon had 
secretly offered to the British Hanover (that gilded hook by 
which he caught her early in the year), now resolved to avenge 
this, the last of several insults. Napoleon was surprised by the 
news of Prussia's mobilization; he had come to regard her as 
a negligible quantity, and now he found that her unexpected 
sensitiveness on points of honour was about to revivify the 
Third Coalition against France. 

The war which broke out early in October 1806 (sometimes 
known as the war of the Fourth Coalition) ran a course curiously 
like that of 1805 in its main outlines. For Austria we may 
read Prussia; for Ulm, Jena-Auerstadt; for the occupation of 
Vienna, that of Berlin; for Austerlitz, Friedland, which again 
disposed of the belated succour given by Russia. The parallel 
extends even to the secret negotiations; for, if Austria could 
have been induced in May 1 807 to send an army against Napoleon's 
communications, his position would have been fully as dangerous 
as before Austerlitz if Prussia had taken a similar step. Once 
more he triumphed owing to the timidity of the central power 
which had the game in its hands; and the folly which marked 
the Russian tactics at Friedland (14th of June 1807), as at 
Austerlitz, enabled him to close the campaign in a blaze of 
glory and shiver the coalition in pieces.

Now came an opportunity far greater than that which occurred 
after Austerlitz. The Peace of Presburg was merely continental. 
That of Tilsit was of world-wide importance. But before refer- 
ring to its terms we must note an event which indicated the lines 
on which Napoleon's policy would advance. After occupying 
the Prussian capital he launched against England the famous 
Berlin Decree (21st of November 1806), declaring her coasts 
to be in a state of blockade, and prohibiting all commerce with 
them. No ship coming thence was to be admitted into French 
or allied harbours; ships transgressing the decree were to be 
good prize of war; and British subjects were liable to imprison- 
ment if found in French or allied territories. This decree is 
often called the basis of the Continental System, whereby 
Napoleon proposed to ruin England by ruining her commerce. 
But even before Trafalgar he had begun to strike at that most 
vulnerable form of wealth, as the Jacobins had done before him. 
Nelson's crowning triumph rendered impossible for the present 
all other means of attack on those elusive foes; and Napoleon's 
sense of the importance of that battle may be gauged, not by 
his public utterances on the subject, but by his persistence in 
forcing Prussia to close Hanover and the whole coastline of 
north-west Germany against British goods. That proceeding, 
in February 1806, constitutes the basis of the Continental 
System. The Berlin Decree gave it a wide extension. By 
the mighty blow of Friedland and the astonishing diplomatic 
triumph of Tilsit, the conqueror hoped speedily to overwhelm 
the islanders beneath the mass of the world's opposition. 
Napoleon at Tilsit resembles Polyphemus seeking to destroy 
Ulysses. The crags which he flung at Britannia did indeed 
graze the stern and graze the prow of her craft. 

The triumph won at Friedland marks in several respects the 
climax of Napoleon's career. The opportunity was unique; 
and he now put forth his utmost endeavours to win over to his 
side the conquered but still formidable tsar. In their first inter- 
view, held on a raft in the middle of the river Niemen at Tilsit 
on the 25th of June, the French emperor, by bis mingled strength 
and suppleness of intellect, gained an easy mastery over the 
impressionable young potentate. Partly from fear of a national 
Polish rising which Napoleon held in reserve as a last means of 
coercion, and partly from a subtle resolve to use the French 
alliance as a means of securing rich domains at the expense of 
Turkey, Prussia, Sweden and England, Alexander decided to 
throw over his allies, Prussia and England, and to seize the 
spoils to which the conqueror pointed as the natural sequel of 
a Franco-Russian alliance. Napoleon, therefore, had Prussia 
completely at his mercy; and his conditions to that power bore 
witness to the fact. The prayers of Queen Louisa of Prussia 
failed to bend him from his resolve. He refused even to grant 
her tearful request for Magdeburg. At a later time he reproached 
himself for not having dethroned the Hohenzollerns outright; 
but it is now known that Alexander would have forbidden this 
step, and that he dissuaded Napoleon from withdrawing Silesia 
from the control of the House of Hohenzollern. Even so, Prussia 
was bereft of half of her territories; those west of the river 
Elbe went to swell the domains of Napoleon's vassals or to form 
the new kingdom of Westphalia for Jerome Bonaparte; while 
the spoils which the House of Hohenzollern had won from Poland 
in the second and third partitions were now to form the duchy 
of Warsaw, ruled over by Napoleon's ally, the elector (now 
king) of Saxony. Danzig became nominally a free city, but was 
to be occupied by a French garrison until the peace. The tsar 
acquired a frontier district from Prussia, recognized the changes 
brought about by Napoleon in Germany and Italy, and agreed 
by a secret article that the Cattaro district on the east coast of 
the Adriatic should go to France. Equally important was the 
secret treaty of alliance between France and Russia signed on 
that same day. By it Napoleon brought the tsar to agree to 
make war on England in case that power did not accept the 
tsar's mediation for the conclusion of a general peace. Failing 
the arrival of a favourable reply from London by the 1st of 
December 1807, the tsar would help Napoleon to compel 
Denmark, Sweden and Portugal to close their ports against, and 



make war on, Great Britain. Napoleon also promised to mediate 
between Russia and Turkey in the interests of the former, 
and (in case the Porte refused to accept the proffered terms) 
to help Russia to drive the Turks from Europe, "the city of 
Constantinople and the province of Rumelia alone excepted*" 
This enterprise and the acquisition of Finland from Sweden, 
which Napoleon also dangled before the eyes of the tsar, formed 
the bait which brought that potentate into Napoleon's Continental 
System. Both Russia and Prussia now agreed rigorously to 
exclude British ships and goods from their dominions. 

The terms last named indicate the nature of the aims which 
Napoleon had in view at Tilsit. That compact was not, as has 
often been assumed, merely the means of assuring to Napoleon 
the mastery of the continent and the control of a cohort of kings. 
That eminence he enjoyed before the collision with Prussia 
in the autumn of 1806; and he frequently, and no doubt sincerely, 
expressed contempt of conquests dans cette vieille Europe. 
The three coalitions against France had not produced a single 
warrior worthy of his steel. The treaty of Tilsit may more 
reasonably be looked on as an expedient for piling up enormous 
political resources with a view to the coercion of Great Britain. 
If that end could not be achieved by massing the continental 
states against her in a solid phalanx of commercial war, then 
Napoleon intended to ensure her ruin by that other enterprise 
which he had in view early in 1798 (see his letter of the 23rd of 
February 1798), namely the conquest of the Orient. An expedi- 
tion against India had recently occupied his thoughts, as may 
be seen by the instructions which he issued on the 10th of May 
1807 to General Gardane for his mission to Persia. The Orient 
was, indeed, ever the magnet which attracted him most; and his 
hostility to England may be attributed to his perception that 
she alone stood in the way of his most cherished schemes. The 
treaty of Tilsit, then, far from being merely a European event, 
was an event of the first importance in what may be termed 
the Welt-politik of Napoleon. His confidence that his vastly 
enhanced powers would enable him first to coerce, and there- 
after to overthrow, the British empire may be illustrated by his 
allowing the appearance in 1807 of an official atlas of Australia 
in which about one-third of that continent figures as "Terre 
Napoleon." 

As usually happened in this strife of the land power and the 
sea power, Napoleon's continental policy attained an almost 
complete success, while the naval and oriental schemes which 
he had more nearly at heart utterly miscarried. The continent 
accepted the new development of his System. After some 
diplomatic fencing Russia and Prussia broke with England 
and entered upon what was, officially at least, a state of war 
with her. Further, owing to the carelessness of the Prussian 
negotiator, Napoleon was able to require the exaction of im- 
possibly large sums from that exhausted land, and therefore 
to keep his troops in her chief fortresses. The duchy of Warsaw 
and the fortress of Danzig formed new outworks of his power 
and enabled him to overawe Russia. In home affairs as in 
foreign affairs his actions bespoke the master. On returning 
from Tilsit to Paris he relieved Talleyrand of the ministry of 
foreign affairs, softening the fall by creating him a grand 
dignitary of the empire. The more subservient Champagny 
now became what was virtually the chief clerk in the French 
foreign office; and other changes placed in high station men 
who were remarkable for docility rather than originality and 
power. Napoleon also suppressed the Tribunate; and in the 
year 1808 instituted an order of nobility. During the course 
of a tour in Italy in December 1807 he gave a sharp turn to that 
world-compelling screw, the Continental System. By the Milan 
Decree of the 17th of December 1807, he ordained that every 
ship which submitted to the right of search now claimed by 
Great Britain would be considered a lawful prize. The imperious 
terms in which this decree was couched and its misleading 
reference to the British maritime code showed that Napoleon 
believed in the imminent collapse of his sole remaining enemy. 
This was natural. Britain, it was true, acting on the initiative 
of George Canning, had seized the Danish fleet, thus forestalling 



204 



NAPOLEON I. 



an action which Napoleon certainly contemplated; but on the 
other hand Denmark now allied herself with him; and while 
in Lombardy he heard of the triumphant entry of his. troops 
into Lisbon — an event which seemed to prelude his domination 
in the Iberian Peninsula and thereafter in the Mediterranean. 

The occupation of Lisbon, which led on to Napoleon's inter- 
vention in Spanish affairs, resulted naturally from the treaty 
of Tilsit. The coercion of England's oldest ally had long been 
one of Napoleon's most cherished aims, and was expressly pro- 
vided for in that compact. To this scheme he turned with a 
zeal whetted by consciousness of his failure respecting the Danish 
fleet. On the 27th of October 1807 he signed with a Spanish 
envoy at Fontainebleau a secret convention with a view to the 
partitioning of Portugal between France and Spain. Another 
convention of the same date allowed him to send 28,000 French 
troops into Spain for the occupation of Portugal, an enterprise 
in which a large Spanish force was to help them; 40,000 French 
troops were to be cantonned at Bayonne to support the first 
corps. Seeing that Godoy, the all-powerful minister at Madrid, 
had given mortal offence to Napoleon early in the Prussian 
campaign of 1806 by calling on Spain to arm on behalf of her 
independence, it passes belief how he could have placed his 
country at the mercy of Napoleon at the end of the year 1807. 
The emperor, however, successfully gilded the hook by awarding 
Algarve, the southern province of Portugal, to Godoy. The north 
of Portugal was to go to the widow of the king of Etruria (a 
Spanish Infanta); her realm now passing into the hands of 
Napoleon. Thus Portugal in 1807, like Venice in 1797, was to 
provide the means for widely extending the operations of his 
statecraft. 

The natural result followed. Portugal was easily overrun 
by the allies; but Junot's utmost efforts failed to secure the 
Portuguese fleet, which, under the protection of a British 
squadron, sailed away to Brazil with the royal family, the 
ministers and chief grandees of the realm. In other respects 
all went well. The French reinforcements which entered 
Spain managed to secure some of the strongholds of the northern 
provinces; and the disgraceful feuds in the royal family left 
the country practically at the emperor's mercy. 

The situation was such as to tempt Napoleon on to an under- 
taking on which he had probably set his heart in the autumn 
of 1806, that of dethroning the Spanish Bourbons and of replacing 
them by a Bonaparte. Looking at the surface of the life of 
Spain, he might well believe in its decay. The king, Charles IV., 
looked on helplessly at the ruin wrought by the subservience of 
his kingdom to France since 1796, and he was seemingly blind 
to the criminal intrigues between his queen and the prime minister 
Godoy. His senile spite vented itself on his son Ferdinand, 
whose opposition to the all-powerful favourite procured for him 
hatred at the palace and esteem everywhere else. Latterly 
the prince had fallen into disgrace for proposing, without the 
knowledge of Charles IV., to ally himself with a Bonaparte 
princess. Here, then, were all the conditions which favoured 
Napoleon's intervention. He allowed the prince to hope for 
such a union, and thus enhanced the popularity of the French 
party at Madrid. Godoy, having the prospect of the Algarve 
before him, likewise offered no opposition to the advance of 
Napoleon's troops to the capital; and so it came about that 
Murat, named by Napoleon his Lieutenant in Spain, was able 
to enter Madrid in force and without opposition from that 
usually clannish populace. The course of events, and especially 
the anger of the people, now began to terrify Charles IV., the 
queen and Godoy. They prepared for flight to America — a 
step which Napoleon took care to prevent; and a popular 
outbreak at Aranjuez decided the king then and there to abdicate 
(19th of March 1808). Murat, now acting very warily in the 
hope of gaining the crown of Spain for himself, refused to 
recognize this act as binding, still more so the accession of 
Ferdinand VII. Charles thereupon declared his abdication to 
have been made under duress and therefore null and void. 
The young king, still hoping for Napoleon's favour, now responded 
to the suggestion, forwarded by Savary, that an interview with 



the emperor would clear up the situation. The same prospect 
was held out to Charles IV., the queen and Godoy, with the 
result that the rivals for the throne proceeded to the north of 
Spain to meet the arbiter of their destinies. Napoleon journeyed 
to Bayonne and remained there. The claimants, each not know- 
ing of the movements of the other, crossed the Pyrenees, and 
Ferdinand on his arrival at Bayonne found himself to be virtually 
a prisoner in the hands of the emperor. Napoleon had little 
difficulty in disposing of the father, whose rage against his son 
blunted his senses in every other direction. As for Ferdinand, 
the emperor, on hearing the news of a rising in Madrid on the 
2nd of May, overwhelmed him with threats, until he resigned 
the crown into the hands of his father, who had already bargained 
it away to Napoleon in return for a pension (5th of May 1808). 
Princely abodes in France and annuities (the latter to be paid 
by Spain) — such was the price at which Napoleon bought the 
crown of Spain and the Indies. Naturally nothing more was 
heard of the partition of Portugal. According to outward ap- 
pearance nothing was wanting to complete the emperor's 
triumph. He is said to have remarked with an oath after Jena 
that he would make the Spanish Bourbons pay for their recent 
bellicose proclamation. If the story is correct, his acts at 
Bayonne showed once more his custom of biding his time in 
order to take an overwhelming revenge. That the son of a 
Corsican notary should have been able to dispose of the Spanish 
Bourbons in this contemptuously easy way is one of the marvels 
of history. 

But even in this crowning triumph the cramping egotism 
of his nature — a mental vice which now grew on him rapidly 
— fatally narrowed his outlook and led him to commit an irre- 
trievable blunder. In his contempt for the rulers of Spain he 
forgot the Spanish people. In all the genuine letters of the 
spring of 1808 — that of March 29th to Murat, no. 13,696 of the 
Correspondence, is acknowledged to be a forgery — there is not a 
sign that he regarded the Spaniards as of any account. On the 
27th of March he offered the crown of Spain to his brother Louis, 
king of Holland, in these terms: " The climate of Holland does 
not suit you; besides Holland can never rise from its ruins. 
I think of you for the throne of Spain. You will be the sovereign 
of a generous nation of eleven millions of men and of important 
colonies." On Louis declining the honour, it devolved on 
Joseph, king of Naples, who vacated that throne for the benefit 
of Murat — a source of disappointment and annoyance to both. 
The emperor pushed on his schemes regardless of everything. 
The first signs of the rising ferment in Spain were wasted on him. 
He believed that the arrival of so benevolent a king as Joseph, 
and the promulgation of a number of useful reforms based on 
those of the French Revolution, would soothe any passing 
irritation. If not, then his troops could deal with it as Murat 
had dealt with the men of Madrid on the 2nd of May. He, 
therefore, pressed on the march of a corps of French and Swiss 
troops under Dupont towards Cadiz, in order to take possession 
of the French sail of the line, five in number, which had been 
in that harbour since Trafalgar. The importance which he 
then assigned to naval affairs appears in many letters of the 
months May to June 1808. He intended that Spain should 
very soon have ready twenty-eight sail of the line — " ce qui est 
certes bien peu de chose " — so as to drive away the British 
squadrons, and then he would strike " de grands coups " in 
the autumn. Evidently then the Spanish dockyards and warships 
(when vigorously organized) were to count for much in the 
schemes for assuring complete supremacy in the Mediterranean 
and the ultimate overthrow of the British and Turkish empires, 
which he then had closely at heart. 

The Spanish rising of May-June 1808 ruined these plans 
irretrievably. The men of Cadiz compelled the French warships 
to surrender, and the levies of Andalusia, closing around Dupont, 
compelled him and some 23,000 men to lay down their arms 
at Baylen (23rd of July). This disaster, the most serious suffered 
by the French since Rossbach, sent a thrill through the Napoleonic 
vassal states and aroused in Napoleon transports of anger 
against Dupont. " Everything is connected with this event," 



NAPOLEON I. 



205 



he wrote on the 2nd of August, " Germany, Poland, Italy." 
Indeed, along with other serious checks in Spain, which involved 
the conquest of that land, it cut through the wide meshes of his 
policy both in Levantine, Central European and commercial 
affairs. The partition of Turkey had to be postponed; the 
financial collapse of England could not be expected now that 
she framed an alliance with the Spanish patriots and had their 
markets and those of their colonies opened to her ; and the 
discussions with the tsar Alexander, which had not gone quite 
smoothly, now took a decidedly unfavourable turn. The tsar 
saw his chance of improving on the terms arranged at Tilsit; 
and obviously Napoleon could not begin the conquest of Spain 
until he felt sure of the conduct of his nominal ally. Still worse 
was the prospect when Sir Arthur Wellesley with a British force 
landed in Portugal, gained the battle of Vimiero (21st of August), 
and brought the French commander, Junot, by the so-called 
convention of Cintra, to agree to the evacuation of the country 
by all the French troops. The sea power thus gained what had 
all along been wanting, a sure basis for the exercise of its force 
against the land power, Napoleon. Still more important, perhaps, 
was the change in moral which the Spanish rising brought about. 
Napoleon's perfidy at Bayonne was so flagrant as to strip from 
him the mask of a champion of popular liberty which had 
previously been of priceless worth. Now he stood forth to the 
world as an unscrupulous aggressor; moral force, previously 
marshalled on the side of France, now began to pass to the side of 
his opponents. The value of that unseen ally he well knew: 
" Once again, let me tell you," he wrote to General Clarke on 
the 10th of October 1809, " in war moral and opinion are more 
than half of the reality." 

Such were the discouraging conditions which weighed him 
down at the time of the interview with the tsar at Erfurt 
(September 27th-October 12th, 1808). That event was so 
important as to require some preliminary explanation. For 
some five months past the two emperors had been exchanging 
their views as to the future of the world. Stated briefly they 
were these. Napoleon desired to press on the partition of Prussia, 
Alexander that of Turkey. The tsar, however, was determined 
to save Prussia if he could; and Napoleon after the first disasters 
in Spain saw it to be impossible to uproot the Hohenzollerns; 
while it was clearly to his interest to postpone the partition of 
Turkey until he had conquered Spain and Sicily. Austria 
meanwhile had begun to arm as a precautionary measure; 
and Napoleon, shortly after his return from Bayonne to Paris, 
publicly declared that, if her preparations went on, he would 
wage against her a war of extermination. The threat naturally 
did not tend to reassure statesmen at Vienna; and trie tsar 
now resolved to prevent the total wreck of the European system 
by screening the House of Habsburg from the wrath of his ally. 
For the present Napoleon's ire fell upon Prussia. A letter written 
by the Prussian statesman, Baron vom Stein, had fallen into the 
hands of the French and revealed to the emperor the ferment 
produced in Germany by news of the French reverses in Spain. 
In that letter Stein urged the need of a national rising of the 
Germans similar to that of the Spaniards, when the inevitable 
struggle ensued between Napoleon and Austria. The revenge of 
the autocrat was characteristic. Besides driving Stein from 
office, he compelled Prussia to sign a convention(8th of September) 
for the payment to France of a sum of 140,000,000 francs, and 
for the limitation of the Prussian army to 42,000 men. 

Apart from this advantage, placed in his hands by the imprud- 
ence of Stein, Napoleon was heavily handicapped at the Erfurt 
interview. In vain did he seek to dazzle the tsar by assembling 
about him the vassal kings and princes of Germany; in vain did 
he exercise all the intellectual gifts which had captivated the 
tsar at Tilsit; in vain did he conjure up visions of the future 
conquest of the Orient; external display, diplomatic finesse, 
varied by one or two outbursts of calculated violence — all was 
useless. The situation now was utterly different from that 
which obtained at Tilsit. Alexander had succeeded in pacifying 
Finland, and his troops held the Danubian provinces of Turkey — 
a pledge, as it seemed, for the future conquest of Constantinople. 



Napoleon, on the other hand, had utterly failed in his Spanish 
enterprise; and the tsar felt sure that his rival must soon with- 
draw French garrisons from the fortresses of the Oder to the 
frontier of Spain. These facts, and not, as has often been 
assumed, the treachery of Talleyrand, decided Alexander to 
assume at Erfurt an attitude of jealous reserve. He refused to 
join Napoleon in any proposal for the coercion of Austria or the 
limitation of her armaments. Finally he agreed to join his ally if 
he (Napoleon) were attacked by the Habsburg power. Napoleon 
on his side succeeded in adjourning the question of the partition 
of Turkey; but he awarded the Danubian provinces and Finland 
to his ally and agreed to withdraw the French garrisons from 
the Prussian fortresses on the Oder. On the 12th of October 
both potentates addressed an appeal to George III. to accord 
peace to the world on the basis of uti possidetis. Canning 
assented, provided that envoys of all the states and peoples 
concerned took part in the negotiations. Whereupon a reply 
came from Paris (28th of November) that the French emperor 
refused to admit the envoys of " the king who reigns in Brazil, 
the king who reigns in Sicily or the king who reigns in Sweden." 
The " Spanish insurgents " were equally placed out of court. 
Clearly, then, Napoleon's desire for peace was conditional 
on his being allowed to dictate terms to the rulers and peoples 
concerned. 

Already he had shown that the sword must decide affairs in 
Spain. After spending a short time in Paris in order to supervise 
the transfer of his forces from Germany to the Pyrenees, he 
journeyed swiftly southwards, burst upon the Spaniards, and 
on the 3rd of December received the surrender of Madrid. There, 
on the iCth of December, he issued a decree (omitted from the 
official Correspondence) declaring le nommi Stein an enemy of 
France and confiscating his property in the lands allied to France. 
The great statesman barely succeeded in escaping to Austria, a 
land in which the hopes of German patriots now centred. En- 
couraged by the sympathy of all patriotic Germans and the newly 
found energy of its own subjects, the House of Habsburg now 
began to prepare for war. Napoleon was then in the midst of 
operations against Sir John Moore, whose masterly march on 
Sahagun (near Valladolid) had thwarted the emperor's plans for 
a general " drive " on to Lisbon. Hoping to punish Moore for 
his boldness, Napoleon struck quickly north at Astorga, but found 
that he was too late to catch his foe. At that town he also heard 
news on the 1st of January 1809, which portended trouble in 
Germany and perhaps also at Paris. Austria was continuing to 
arm; and the emperor perceived that the diplomatic failure at 
Erfurt was now about to entail on him another and more serious 
struggle. His anxiety was increased by news of sinister import 
respecting frequent interviews between those former rivals, 
Talleyrand and Fouche, in which Murat was said to be concerned. 
Handing over the command to Soult, he hurried back to Paris 
to trample on the seeds of sedition and to overwhelm Austria by 
the blows which he showered upon her in the valley of the 
Danube. Sir John Moore and the statesmen of Austria — the 
heroic Stadion at their head — failed in their enterprise; but at 
least they frustrated the determined effort of Napoleon to stamp 
out the national movement in the Iberian Peninsula. Thereafter 
he never entered Spain; and the French operations suffered 
incalculably from the want of one able commander-in-chief. 

In the Danubian campaign of 1809 he succeeded; but the 
stubborn defence of Austria, the heroic efforts of the Tirolese 
and the spasmodic efforts which foreboded a national rising in 
Germany, showed that the whole aspect of affairs was changing? 
even in central Europe, where rulers and peoples had hitherto 
been as wax under the impress of his will. The peoples, formerly 
so apathetic, were now the centre of resistance, and their efforts 
failed owing to the timidity or sluggishness of governments 
and the incompetence of some of their military leaders. The 
failure of the archduke John to arrive in time at Wagram (5th 
of July), the lack of support accorded by the Spaniards to 
Wellesley before and after the battle of Talavera (28th of July), 
and the slowness with which the British government sent forth 
its great armada.against Flushing and Antwerp, a fortnight after 



2o6 



NAPOLEON I. 



Austria sued for an armistice from Napoleon, enabled that superb 
organizer to emerge victorious from a most precarious situation. 
The hatred felt for him by Germans found expression in a 
daring attempt to murder him made by a well-bred youth named 
Staps on the 12th of October. 

Two days later Napoleon, by means of unworthy artifices, 
hurried the Austrian plenipotentiaries into signing the treaty of. 
peace at Schonbrunn. The House of Habsburg now ceded 
Salzburg and the Inn-Viertel to Napoleon (for his ally, the king 
of Bavaria); a great portion of the spoils which Austria had torn 
from Poland in 1795 went to the grand duchy of Warsaw, or 
Russia; and the cession of her provinces Carinthia, Carniola 
and Istria to the French empire cut her off from all access to the 
sea. After imposing these harsh terms on his enemy, the con- 
queror might naturally have shown clemency to the Tirolese 
leader, Andreas Hofer; but that brave mountaineer, when 
betrayed by a friend, was sentenced to death at Mantua owing 
to the arrival of a special message to that effect from Napoleon. 

In other quarters he achieved for the present a signal success. 
It was his habit to issue important decrees from the capitals of 
his enemies; and on the 17th of May 1809 he signed at Vienna 
an edict abolishing the temporal power of the pope and annexing 
the Papal States, which the French troops had occupied early 
in the previous year. On the 6th of July 1809 Pius VII. was 
arrested at Rome for presuming to excommunicate the successor 
of Charlemagne, and was deported to Grenoble and later on to 
Savona. The same year witnessed the downfall of Napoleon's 
persistent enemy, Gustavus IV. of Sweden, who was dethroned 
by a military movement (29th of March 1809). His successor, 
Charles XIII., made peace with France on the 6th of January 
1 8 10, and agreed to adopt the provisions of the Continental 
System. The aim in all these changes, it will be observed, was 
to acquire control over the seaboard, or, failing that, the com- 
merce of all European states. 

As happened in the years 1 802-1 803, Napoleon extended his 
" System " as rapidly in time of peace as during war. The year 
1810 saw the crown set to that edifice by the annexations of 
Holland and of the north-west coast of Germany. In both cases 
the operative cause was the same. Neither Louis Bonaparte nor 
German douaniers could be trusted to carry out in all their 
stringency the decrees for the entire exclusion of British commerce 
from those important regions. In the case of King Louis, family 
quarrels embittered the relations between the two brothers; 
but it is clear from Napoleon's letters of November-December 
1809 that he had even then resolved to annex Holland in order 
to gain complete control of its customs and of its naval resources. 
The negotiations which he allowed to go on with England in 
the spring of 1810, mainly respecting the independence of 
Holland, are now known to have been insincere. Fouche, for 
meddling in the negotiations through an agent of his own, was 
promptly disgraced; and, when neither England was moved by 
diplomatic cajolery nor Louis Bonaparte by threats, French 
troops were sent against the Dutch capital. Louis fled from his 
kingdom, and on the 9th of July 18 10 Holland became part of 
the French empire. In the next months Napoleon promulgated 
a series of decrees for effecting the ruin of British commerce, 
and in December .1810 he decreed the annexation of the north- 
west coast of Germany, as also of Canton Valais, to the French 
empire. This* now stretched from Liibeck to the Pyrenees, 
from Brest to Rome; while another arm (only nominally severed 
from the empire by the Napoleonic kingdom of Italy) extended 
down the eastern shore of the Adriatic to Ragusa and Cattaro, 
threatening the Turkish empire with schemes of partition always 
imminent but never achieved. 

. It is time now to notice two important events in the life of the 
emperor, namely his divorce of Josephine and his union with 
Marie Louise of Austria. The former of these had long been 
foreseen. The Bonapartes had intrigued for it with their usual 
persistence, and Napoleon was careful never to make it im- 
possible. His triumph over Austria in 1809, and especially the 
attempt of Staps to murder him, clinched his determination to 
found a dynasty in his own direct line. From Josephine he could 



not expect to have an heir. Accordingly, on his return to Paris 
he caused the news to be broken to her that reasons of state of 
the most urgent kind compelled him to divorce her. An affecting 
scene took place hetween them on the 30th of November 1809; 
but Napoleon, though moved by her distress, remained firm; 
and though the clerics made a difficulty about dissolving the 
religious marriage of the 1st of December 1804, the formalities of 
which were complete save that the parish priest was absent, yet 
the emperor instituted a chancery for the archbishop of Paris, 
with the result that that body pronounced the divorce (January 
1810). Josephine retired to her private abode, Malmaison, where 
her patience and serenity won the admiration of all who saw her. 

Meanwhile the deliberations respecting the choice of her 
successor had already begun. Opinions were divided in the 
emperor's circle between a Russian and an Austrian princess; 
but the marked coolness with which overtures for the hand of 
the tsar's sister were received at St Petersburg, and the skill 
with which Count Metternich, the Austrian chancellor, let it be 
known that a union with the archduchess, Marie Louise, would be 
welcomed at Schonbrunn, helped to decide the matter. The 
reasons why the emperor Francis acquiesced in the marriage 
alliance are well known. Only so could his empire survive. 
A marriage between Napoleon and a Russian princess would have 
implied the permanent subjection of Austria. By the proposed 
step she would weaken the Franco-Russian alliance. But why 
did Napoleon fix his choice on Vienna rather than St Petersburg? 
Mainly, it would seem, because he desired hurriedly to screen 
the refusal, which might at any time be expected from the Russian 
court, under the appearance of a voluntary choice of an Austrian 
archduchess. Further, an alliance with the House of Habsburg 
might be expected to wean the Germans from all thought of 
gaining succour from that quarter. The wedding was celebrated 
first at Vienna by proxy, and at Notre Dame by the emperor in 
person on the 2nd of April. Though based on merely political 
grounds, the union was for the time a happy one. He advised 
his courtiers to marry Germans — " they are the best wives in the 
world, good, naive and fresh as roses." Metternich, on visiting 
Compiegne and Paris, found the emperor thoroughly devoted to 
his bride. Napoleon toldlrim that he was now beginning to live, 
that he had always longed for a home and now at last had one. 
Metternich thereupon wrote to his master: " He (Napoleon) 
has possibly more weaknesses than many other men, and if the 
empress continues to play upon them, as she begins to realize 
the possibility of doing, she can render the greatest services to her- 
self and all Europe." The surmise was too hopeful. Napoleon, 
though he never again worked as he had done, soon freed himself 
from complete dependence on Marie Louise; and he never allowed 
her to intrude into political affairs, for which, indeed, she had not 
the least aptitude. His real concern for her was evinced shortly 
before the birth of their son, the king of Rome,whenhegave orders 
that if the life of both mother and child could not be saved, that 
of the mother should be saved if possible (20th of March 181 1). 

This event seemed to place Napoleon's fortunes on a sure 
basis; but already they were being undermined by events. The 
marriage negotiations of 1809-1810 had somewhat offended the 
emperor Alexander; his resentment increased when, at the close 
of 1810, Napoleon dethroned the duke of Oldenburg, brother-in- 
law of the tsar; and the breach in the Franco-Russian alliance 
widened when the French emperor refused to award fit com- 
pensation to the duke or to give to the Russian government an 
assurance that the kingdom of Poland would never be re- 
constituted. The addition of large territories to the grand 
duchy of Warsaw after the war of 1809 aroused the fears of the 
tsar respecting the Poles; and he regarded all Napoleon's 
actions as inspired by hostility to Russia. He, therefore, despite 
Napoleon's repeated demands, refused to subject his empire 
to the hardships imposed by the Continental System; at the 
close of the year 18 10 he virtually allowed the entry of colonial 
goods (all of which were really British borne) and little by little 
broke away from Napoleon's system. These actions implied war 
between France and Russia, unless Napoleon allowed such 
modifications of his rules {e.g. under the license system) as would 



NAPOLEON I. 



207 



avert ruin from the trade and finance of Russia; and this he 
refused to do. 

The campaign of 181 2 may, therefore, be considered as result- 
ing, firstly, from the complex and cramping effects of the Conti- 
nental System on a northern land which could not deprive itself 
of colonial goods; secondly, from Napoleon's refusal to mitigate 
the anxiety of Alexander on the Polish question; and thirdly, 
from the annoyance felt by the tsar at the family matters 
noticed above. Napoleon undoubtedly entered on the struggle 
with reluctance. He spoke about it as one that lay in the course 
of destiny. In one sense he was right. If the Continental 
System was inevitable the war with Russia was inevitable. But 
that struggle may more reasonably be ascribed to the rigidity 
with which he carried out his commercial decrees and his diplo- 
macy. He often prided himself on his absolute consistency, 
and we have Chaptal's warrant for the statement that, after the 
time of the Consulate, his habit of following his own opinions 
and rejecting all advice, even when he had asked for it, became 
more and more pronounced. It was so now. He took no heed 
of the warnings uttered by those sage counsellors, Cambaceres 
and Talleyrand, against an invasion of Russia, while "the 
Spanish ulcer " was sapping the strength of the empire at the 
other extremity. He encased himself in fatalism, with the result 
that in two years the mightiest empire reared by man broke under 
the twofold strain. His diplomacy before the war of 1812 was 
less successful than that of Alexander, who skilfully ended his 
quarrel with Turkey and gained over to his side Sweden. That 
state, where Bernadotte had latterly been chosen as crown 
prince, decided to throw off the yoke of the Continental System 
and join England and Russia, gaining from the latter power the 
promise of Norway at the expense of Denmark. 

Napoleon on his side coerced Prussia into an offensive alliance 
and had the support of Austria and the states of the Rhenish 
Confederation. At Dresden he held court for a few days in May 
181 2 with Marie Louise: the emperor Francis, the king of 
Prussia and a host of lesser dignitaries were present — a sign of 
the power of the modern Charlemagne. It was the last time that 
he figured as master of the continent. 

The military events of the years 1812-1814 are described under 
Napoleonic Campaigns; and we need therefore note here only 
a few details personal to Napoleon or some considerations which 
influenced his policy. Firstly we may remark that the Austrian 
alliance furnished one of the motives which led him to refrain 
during the campaign of 181 2 from reconstituting the Polish realm 
in its ancient extent. To have done so would have been a mortal 
affront to his ally, Austria. Certainly he needed her support 
during that campaign; but many good judges have inclined 
to the belief that the whole-hearted support of Poles and Lithu- 
anians would have been of still greater value, and that the organi- 
zation of their resources might well have occupied him during the 
winter of 1812-1813, an d would have furnished him with a new 
and advanced base from which to strike at the heart of Russia 
in the early summer of 1813. If the Austrian alliance was chiefly 
responsible for his rejection of that statesmanlike plan, which 
he had before him at Smolensk, it certainly deserves all the hard 
things said of it by the champions of Josephine. 

Another consideration which largely conduced to the disasters 
of the retreat was Napoleon's postponement of any movement 
back from Moscow to the date of October 19th, and this is known 
to have resulted from his conviction that^the tsar would give 
way as he had done at Tilsit. Napoleon's habit of dinging to his 
own preconceptions never received so strange and disastrous an 
illustration as it did during the month spent at Moscow. * On the 
other hand, his desertion of the army on the 5th of December, 
not long after the crossing of the river Beresina, is a thoroughly 
defensible act. He had recently heard of the attempt of a French 
republican general, Malet, to seize the public offices at Paris, a 
quixotic adventure which had come surprisingly near to success 
owing to the assurance with which that officer proclaimed the 
news of the emperor's death in Russia. In such a case, the best 
retort was to return in all haste in order to put more energy into 
the huge centralized organism which the emperor alone could 



work. His rapid return from Spain early in 1809, and now again 
from Lithuania at the close of 1812, gives an instructive glimpse 
into the anxiety which haunted the mind of the autocrat. He 
believed that, imposing as his position was, it rested on the prestige 
won by matchless triumphs. Witness his illuminating state- 
ment to Volney during the Consulate: " Why should France 
fear my ambition? I am but the magistrate of the republic. 
I merely act upon the imagination of the nation. When that 
fails me I shall be nothing, and another will succeed me." 

To this cause we may ascribe his constant efforts to dazzle 
France by grandiose adventures and by swift, unexpected 
movements. But she had now come profoundly to distrust 
him. Her thirst for glory had long since been slaked, and she 
longed for peaceful enjoyment of the civic boons which he had 
conferred upon her in that greatest period of his life, the Con- 
sulate. That the Russian campaign o f 181 2 was the last device 
for assuring The success ot tire'Cofitmental System and tEeTum 
of England was nothing to the great mass of Frenchmen. They 
were weary of a means of pacification which produced endless 
wars abroad and misery at home. True, England had suffered, 
but she was mistress of the seas and had won a score of new 
colonies. France had subjected half the continent; but her 
hold on Spain was weakened by Wellington's blow at Salamanca; 
and now Frenchmen heard that their army in Russia was " dead." 
At home many industries were suffering from the lack of tropical 
and colonial produce: cane sugar sold at five, and coffee at 
seven, shillings the pound. The constant use of chicory for 
coffee, and of woad for indigo, was apt to produce a reaction 
in favour of a humdrum peaceful policy; and yet, by a recent 
imperial decree, Frenchmen had the prospect of seeing the use 
of the new and imperfectly made beet sugar enforced from the 
1 st of January 1813, after which date all cane sugar was^ 
excluded as being of British origin. Shortly "before starting 
for the Russian expedition Napoleon vainly tried to reassure the * 
merchants and financiers of France then face to face with a 
sharp financial crisis. Now at the close of 181 2 matters were 
worse, and Napoleon, on reaching Paris, found the nation 
preoccupied with the task of finding out how many Frenchmen 
had survived the Russian campaign* 

Yet, despite the discontent seething in many quarters, France 
responded to his appeal for troops; but she did so mechanically 
and without hope. Early in January 1813 the senate promised 
that 350,000 conscripts should be enrolled; but 150,000 of them 
were under twenty years of age, and mobile columns had to be 
used to sweep in the recruits, especially in Brittany, the Nether- 
lands and the newly annexed lands of North Germany. 

In the old provinces of France Napoleon's indomitable will over- 
came all difficulties of a material kind. Forces, in experienced but 
devoted, were soon on foot; and he informed his German allies 
that he would allow the Russians to advance into Central 
Germany so as to ensure their destruction. As for the " treason " 
of General York, who had come to terms with the Russians, it 
moved him merely to scorn and contempt. He altogether 
underrated the importance of the national movement in Prussia. 
If Prussian towns " behaved badly " (he wrote on the 4th of 
March), they were to be burnt; Eugene was not to spare even 
Berlin. Prussia (he wrote on the 14th of March) was a weak 
country. She could not put more than 40,000 men in the field 
(the number to which he had limited her in September 1808). 
He therefore heard without dismay at the end of March that 
Prussia had joined Russia in a league in which Sweden was now 
an active participant. 

It was clear that the spiritual forces of the time were also 
slipping out of his grasp. Early in January he sought to come 
to terms with the pope (then virtually a captive at Fontainebleau) 
respecting various questions then in debate concerning the 
Concordat. At first the emperor succeeded in persuading the 
aged pontiff to sign the preliminaries of an agreement, known 
as the " Fontainebleau Concordat " (25th of January 1813); 
but, on its insidious character becoming apparent, Pius VII. 
revoked his consent, as having been given under constraint. 
Nevertheless Napoleon ordered the preliminary agreement to be 



2o8 



NAPOLEON I. 



considered as a definitive treaty, and on the 2nd of April gave 
instructions that one of the refractory cardinals should be 
carried off secretly by night from Fontainebleau, while the pontiff 
was to be guarded more closely than before. On these facts 
becoming known, a feeling of pity for the pope became wide- 
spread; and the opinion of the Roman Catholic world gradually 
turned against the emperor while he was fighting to preserve 
his supremacy in Germany. " I am following the course of 
events: I have always marched with them." Such were his 
words uttered shortly before his departure from Paris (15th of 
April). They proved that he misread events and misunderstood 
his own position. 

The course of the ensuing campaigns was to reveal the harden- 
ing of his mental powers. Early in April he sought to gain the 
help of 100,000 Austrian troops by holding out to Francis of 
Austria the prospect of acquiring Silesia from Prussia. The offer 
met with no response, Austria having received from the allies 
vaguely alluring offers that she might arrange matters as she 
desired in Italy and South Germany. Napoleon began to suspect 
his father-in-law, and still more the Austrian chancellor, 
Metternich; but instead of humouring them, he resolved to 
stand firm. The Austrian demands, first presented to him 
on the 1 6th of May, shortly after his victory of Liitzen, were 
(1) the dissolution of the grand duchy of Warsaw, (2) the with- 
drawal of France from the lands of north-west Germany annexed 
in 1810 and (3) the cession to Austria of the Illyrian provinces 
wrested from her in 1809. Other terms were held in reserve 
to be pressed if occasion admitted; but these were aU that were 
put forward at the moment. On this basis Austria was ready to 
offer her armed mediation to the combatants. Napoleon would 
not hear of the terms. " I will not have your armed mediation. 
You are only confusing the whole question. You say you cannot 
act for me; you are strong, then, only against me." This out- 
burst of temper was a grave blunder. His threats alarmed the 
Austrian court. At bottom the emperor Francis, perhaps also 
Metternich, wanted peace, but on terms which the exhaustion 
of the combatants would enable them to dictate. Yet during the 
armistice which ensued (June 4th-July 20th; afterwards pro- 
longed to August 10th) Napoleon did nothing to soothe the 
Viennese government, and that, too, despite the encouragement 
which the allies received from the news of Wellington's victory 
at Vittoria and the entry of Bernadotte with a Swedish con- 
tingent on the scene. Austria now proposed the terms named 
above with the addition that the Confederation of the Rhine 
must be dissolved, and that Prussia should be placed in a position 
as good as that which she held in 1805, that is, before the 
campaign of Jena. On the 27th of June she promised to join 
the allies in case Napoleon should not accept these terms. 

He was now at the crisis of his career. Events had shown 
that, even after losing half a million of men in Russia, he was 
a match for her and Prussia combined. Would he now accept 
the Austrian terms and gain a not disadvantageous peace, for 
which France was yearning? These terms, it should be noted, 
would have kept Napoleon's empire intact except in Hlyria; 
while the peace would have enabled him to reorganize his army 
and recover a host of French prisoners from Russia. His 
signing of the armistice seemed to promise as much. To give 
his enemies a breathing space when they were hard pressed was an 
insane proceeding unless he meant to make x peace. "But there is 
nothing in his words or actions at this time to show that he 
desired peace except on terms which were clearly antiquated. 
His letters breathe the deepest resentment against Austria, 
and show that he burned to chastise her for her " perfidy " 
as soon as his cavalry was reorganized. His actions at this time 
have been ascribed to righteous indignation against Metternich's 
double-dealing; and in a long interview at the Marcolini palace 
at Dresden on the 26th of June he asked the chancellor point 
blank how much money England had given him for his present 
conduct. As for himself he cared little for the life of a million 
of men. He had married the daughter of the emperor: it 
was a mistake, but he would bury the world under the ruins. 
Talk in this Ossian-like vein showed that Napoleon's brain no 



longer worked clearly: it was a victim to his egotism and passion. 
July and the first decade of August came and went, but brought 
no sign of pacification. The emperor Francis made a last effort 
to influence his son-in-law through Marie Louise. It was in vain. 
Nothing could bend that cast iron will. Nothing remained but 
to break it. On the expiration of the armistice at midnight of 
August ioth-nth Austria declared war. 

After the disastrous defeat of Leipzig (17th-! 9th October 
1813), when French domination in Germany and Italy vanished 
like an exhalation, the allies gave Napoleon another opportunity 
to come to terms. The overtures known as the Frankfort terms 
were ostensibly an answer to the request for information which 
Napoleon made at the field of Leipzig. Metternich persuaded 
the tsar and the king of Prussia to make a declaration that the 
allies would leave to Napoleon the " natural boundaries " of 
France — the Rhine, Alps, Pyrenees and Ocean. The main object 
of the Austrian chancellor probably was to let Napoleon once 
more show to the world his perverse obstinacy. If this was his 
aim, he succeeded. Napoleon on his return to St Cloud inveighed 
against his ministers for talking so much about peace and declared 
that he would never give up Holland; France must remain a 
great empire, and not sink to the level of a mere kingdom. He 
would never give up Holland; rather than do that, he would 
cut the dykes and give back that land to the sea. Accordingly 
on the 16th of November he sent a vague and unsatisfactory 
reply to the allies; and though Caulaincourt (who now replaced 
Maret as foreign minister) was on the 2nd of December charged 
to give a general assent to their terms, yet that assent came 
too late. The allies had now withdrawn their offer. Napoleon 
certainly believed that the offer was insincere. Perhaps he was 
right; but even in that case he should surely have accepted 
the offer so as to expose their insincerity. As it was, they were 
able to contrast their moderation with his wrongheadedness, - 
and thereby seek to separate his cause from that of France. 
In this they only partially succeeded. Murat now joined the 
allies; Germany, Switzerland and Holland were lost to Napoledn; 
but when the allies began to invade Alsace and Lorraine, they 
found the French staunch in his support. He was still the 
peasants' emperor. The feelings of the year 1 792 began to revive. * 
Never did Napoleon and France appear more united than in 
the campaign of 18 14. 

Nevertheless it led to his abdication. Once more the allies 
consented to discuss the terms of a general pacification; but 
the discussions at the congress of Chatillon (5th of February- 
19th of March) had no result except to bring to light a proof 
of Napoleon's insincerity. Thereupon' the allies resolved to have 
no more dealings with him. As his chances of success became 
more and more desperate, he ventured on a step whereby he 
hoped to work potently on the pacific desires of the emperor 
Francis. Leaving Paris for the time to its own resources, he 
struck eastwards in the hope of terrifying that potentate and of 
detaching him from the coalition. The move not only failed, 
but it had the fatal effect of uncovering Paris to the northern 
forces of the allies. The surrender of the capital, where he had 
centralized all the governing powers, was a grave disaster. 
Equally fatal was the blow struck at him by the senate, his own 
favoured creation. Convoked by Talleyrand on the 1st of 
April, it pronounced the word abdication on the morrow. For this 
Napoleon cared little, provided that he had the army behind 
him. But now the marshals and generals joined the civilians. 
The defection of Marshal Marmont and his soldiery on the 4th 
of April rendered further thoughts of resistance futile. To 
continue the strife when Wellington was firmly established on 
the line of the Garonne, and Lyons and Bordeaux had hoisted 
the Bourbon fleur de lys y was seen by aU but Napoleon to be sheer 
madness; but it needed the pressure of his marshals in painful 
interviews at Fontainebleau to bring him to reason. 

At last, on the nth of April, he wrote the deed of abdication. 
On that night he is said to have tried to end his life by poison. 
The evidence is not convincing; and certainly his recovery 
was very speedy. On the 20th he bade farewell to his guard 
and set forth from Fontainebleau for Elba, which the powers 



NAPOLEON I. 



209 



had very reluctantly, and owing to the pressure of the tsar, 
awarded to him as a possession. He was to keep the title ,of 
emperor. Marie Louise was to have the duchy of Parma for 
herself and her son. She did not go with ner consort. Following 
the advice of her father, she repaired to Vienna along , with the 
little king of Rome. As for France, she received the Bourbons, 
along with the old frontiers. 

Meanwhile Napoleon, after narrow escapes from royalist 
mobs in Provence, was conducted in the British cruiser " Un- 
daunted " to Elba. There he spent eleven months in uneasy 
retirement, watching with close interest the course of events in 
France. As he foresaw, the shrinkage of the great empire into 
the realm of old France caused infinite disgust, a feeling fed 
every day by stories of the tactless way in which the Bourbon 
princes treated veterans of the Grand Army. Equally threaten- 
ing was the general situation in Europe. The demands of the 
tsar Alexander were for a time so exorbitant as to bring the powers 
at the congress of Vienna to the verge of war. Thus, everything 
portended a renewal of Napoleon's activity. The return of 
French prisoners from Russia, Germany, England and Spain 
would furnish him with an army far larger than that .which 
had won renown in 1814. So threatening were the symptoms 
that the royalists at Paris and the plenipotentiaries at Vienna, 
talked of deporting him to the Azores, while others more than 
hinted at assassination^ 

He solved the problem in characteristic fashion. On the 26th 
of February 181 5, when the English and French guardships 
were absent, he slipped away from Porto Ferrajo with some 
1000 men and landed near Antibes on the 1st of March. Except 
in royalist Provence he received everywhere a welcome which 
attested the attractive power of his personality and the nullity 
of the Bourbons. Firing no shot in his defence, his little tropp 
swelled until it became an army. Ney, who had said that Napoleon 
ought to be brought to Paris in an iron cage, joined him with 
6000 men on the 14th of March; and five days later the emperor 
entered the capital, whence Louis XVIII. had recently fled. 

Napoleon was not misled by the enthusiasm of the provinces 
and Paris. He knew that love of novelty and contempt for the 
gouty old king and his greedy courtiers had brought about this 
bloodless triumph; and he felt instinctively that he had to deal 
with a new France, which would not tolerate despotism. On 
his way to Paris he had been profuse in promises of reform and 
constitutional rule. It remained to make good those promises 
and to disarm the fear and jealousy of the great powers. This 
was the work which he set before hirriself in the Hundred Days 
(19th of March to 22nd of June 181 5). Were his powers, physical 
as well as mental, equal to the task ? This is doubtful. Certainly 
the evidence as to his health is somewhat conflicting. Some 
persons (as, for instance, Carnot, Pasquier, Lavalette and 
Thiebault) thought him prematurely aged and enfeebled. Others 
again saw no marked change in him; while Mollien, who knew 
the emperor weD, attributed the lassitude which now and then 
came over him to a feeling of perplexity caused by his changed 
circumstances. This explanation seems to furnish a correct 
clue. The autocrat felt cramped and chafed on all sides by the 
necessity of posing as a constitutional sovereign; and, while 
losing something of the old rigidity, he lost very much of the old 
energy, both in thought and action. His was a mind that worked 
wonders in well-worn grooves and on facts that were well under- 
stood. The necessity of devising compromises with men who 
had formerly been his tools fretted him both in mind and body. 
But when he left parliamentary affairs behind, and took the field, 
he showed nearly all the power both of initiative and of endurance 
which marked his masterpiece, the campaign of 1814. To date 
his decline, as Chaptal does, from the cold of the Moscow campaign 
is clearly incorrect. The time of lethargy at Elba seems to 
have been more unfavourable to his powers than the cold of 
Russia. At Elba, as Sir Neil Campbell noted, he became in- 
active and proportionately corpulent. There, too, as sometimes 
in 1815, he began to suffer intermittently from ischury, but to 
no serious extent. On the whole it seems safe to assert that it 
was the change in France far more than the change in his health 



which brought about the manifest constraint of the emperor 
in the Hundred Days. His words to Benjamin Constant — " I 
am growing old. The repose of a constitutional king may suit 
me. It will more surely suit my son " — show that his mind 
seized the salient facts of the situation; but his instincts struggled 
against them. Hence the malaise both of mind and body. 

The attempts of the royalists gave him little concern: the due 
d'Angouleme raised a small force for Louis XVIII. in the south, 
but at Valence it melted away in front of Grouchy's command; 
and the duke, on the 9th of April, signed a convention whereby 
they received a free pardon from the emperor. The royalists 
of la Vendue were later in moving and caused more trouble. 
But the chief problem centred in the constitution. At Lyons, 
on the 13th of March, Napoleon had issued an edict dissolving the 
existing chambers and ordering the convocation of a national 
mass meeting, or Champ de Mai, for the purpose of modifying the 
constitution of the Napoleonic empire. That work was carried 
out by Benjamin Constant in concert with the emperor. The 
resulting Acte additiond (supplementary to the constitutions 
of the empire) bestowed on France an hereditary chamber of 
peers and a chamber of representatives elected by the " electoral 
colleges " of the empire, which comprised scarcely one hundredth 
part of the citizens of France. As Chateaubriand remarked, in 
reference to Louis XVTII.'s constitutional charter, the new 
constitution — La Benjamine, it was dubbed — was merely a 
slightly improved charter. Its incompleteness displeased the 
liberals; only 1,532,527 votes were given for it in the plebiscite, 
a total less than half of those of the plebiscites of the Consulate. 
Not all the gorgeous display of the Champ de Mai (held on the 
1 st of June) could hide the discontent at the meagre fulfilment 
of the promises given at Lyons. Napoleon ended his speech with 
the words: " My will is that of the people: my rights are its 
rights." The words rang hollow, as was seen when, on the 3rd 
of June, the deputies chose, as president of their chamber, 
Lanjuinais, the staunch liberal who had so often opposed the 
emperor. The latter was with difficulty dissuaded from quashing 
the election. Other causes of offence arose, and Napoleon in 
his last communication to them warned them not to imitate the 
Greeks of the later Empire, who engaged in subtle discussions 
when the ram was battering at their gates. On the morrow 
(12th of June) he set out for the northern frontier. His spirits 
rose at the prospect of rejoining the army. At St Helena he told 
Gourgaud that he intended in 181 5 to dissolve the chambers 
as soon as he had won a great victory. 

In point of fact, the sword alone could decide his fate, both in 
internal and international affairs. Neither France nor Europe 
took seriously his rather vague declaration of his contentment 
with the r61e of constitutional monarch of the France of 1815. 
No one believed that he would be content with the "ancient 
limits." So often had he declared that the Rhine and Holland 
were necessary to France that every one looked on his present 
assertions as a mere device to gain time. So far back as the 13th 
of March, six days before he reached Paris, the powers at Vienna 
declared him an outlaw; and four days later Great Britain, 
Russia, Austria and Prussia bound themselves to put 150,000 
men into the field to end his rule. Their recollection of his 
conduct during the congress of Chatillon was the determining 
fact at this crisis; his professions at Lyons or Paris had not the 
slightest effect; his efforts to detach Austria from the coalition, 
as also- the feelers put forth tentatively by Fouch6 at Vienna, 
were fruitless. The coalitions, once so brittle as to break at the 
first strain, had now been hammered into solidity by his blows. 
If ever a man was condemned by his past, Napoleon was so in 
181 5. 

On arriving at Paris three days after Waterloo he still clung 
to the hope of concerting national resistance; but the temper 
of the chambers and of the public generally forbade any such 
attempt. The autocrat and Lucien Bonaparte were almost alone 
in believing that by dissolving the chambers and declaring 
himself dictator, he could save France from the armies of the 
powers now converging on Paris. Even Davout, minister of 
war, advised him that the destinies of France rested solely with

the chambers. That was true. The career of Napoleon, which 
had lured France far away from the principles of 1789, now 
brought her back to that starting-point; just as, in the physical 
sphere, his campaigns from 1796-1814 had at first enormously 
swollen her bulk and then subjected her to a shrinkage still more 
portentous. Clearly it was time to safeguard what remained; 
and that could best be done under Talleyrand's shield of legiti- 
macy. Napoleon himself at last divined that truth. When 
Lucien pressed him to " dare," he replied " Alas, I have dared 
only too much already." On the 22nd of June he abdicated in 
favour of his son, well knowing that that was a mere form, as 
his son was in Austria. On the 25th of June he received from 
Fouche, the president of the newly appointed provisional 
government, an intimation that he must leave Paris. He retired 
to Malmaison, the home of Josephine, where she had died shortly 
after his first abdication. On the 29th of June the near approach 
of the Prussians (who had orders to seize him, dead or alive), 
caused him to retire westwards towards Rochefort, whence he 
hoped to reach the United States. But the passports which the 
provisional government asked from Wellington were refused, 
and as the country was declaring for the Bourbons, his position 
soon became precarious. On his arrival at Rochefort (3rd of 
July) he found that British cruisers cut off his hope of escape. 
On the 9th of July he received an order from the provisional 
government at Paris to leave France within twenty-four hours. 
After wavering between various plans, he decided on the 13th 
of July to cast himself on the generosity of the British govern- 
ment, and dictated a letter to the prince regent in which he com- 
pared himself to Themistocles seating himself at the hearth of his 
enemy. His counsellor, Las Cases, strongly urged that step and 
made overtures to Captain Maitland of H.M.S. " Bellerophon." 
That officer, however, was on his guard, and, while offering to 
convey the emperor to England declined to pledge himself in 
any way as to his reception. It was on this understanding (which 
Las Cases afterwards misrepresented) that Napoleon on the 
15th of July mounted the deck of the " Bellerophon." No other 
course remained. Further delay after the 15th of July would 
have led to his capture by the royalists, who were now every- 
where in the ascendant. In all but name he was a prisoner of 
Great Britain, and he knew it. 

The rest of the story must be told very briefly. The British 
government, on hearing of his arrival at Plymouth, decided to 
send him to St Helena, the formation of that island being such 
as to admit of a certain freedom of movement for the august 
captive, with none of the perils for the world at large which the 
tsar's choice, Elba, had involved. To St Helena, then, he pro- 
ceeded on board of H.M.S. " Northumberland." The title of 
emperor, which he enjoyed at Elba, had been forfeited by the 
adventure of 181 5, and he was now treated oificially as a general. 
Nevertheless, during his last voyage he enjoyed excellent health 
even in the tropics, and seemed less depressed than his associates, 
Bertrand, Gourgaud, Las Cases and Montholon. He landed at 
St Helena on the 17th of October. He resided first at " The 
Briars " with the Balcombes, and thereafter at Longwood, 
when that residence was ready for him. The first governor of 
the island, General Wilks, was soon superseded, it being judged 
that he was too amenable to influence from Napoleon; his 
successor was Sir Hudson Lowe. , 

Napoleon's chief relaxations at St Helena were found in the 
dictation of his memoirs to Montholon, and the compilation of 
monographs on military and political topics. The memoirs 
(which may be accepted as mainly Napoleon's, though Montholon 
undoubtedly touched them up) range over most of the events 
of his life from Toulon to Marengo. The military and historical 
works comprise pr&cis of the wars of Julius Caesar, Turenne and 
Trederick the Great. He began other accounts of the campaigns 
of his own age; but they are marred by his having had few 
trustworthy documents and statistics at hand. On a lower 
level as regards credibility stands the Memorial de Sainte- 
Htlbne, compiled by Las Cases from Napoleon's conversations 
with the obvious aim of creating a Napoleonic legend. Never- 
theless the Memorial is of great interest — e.g. the passage 



(iv. 451-454) in which Napoleon reflects on the ruin wrought 
to his cause by the war in Spain, or that (iii. 130) dealing with 
his fatal mistake in not dismembering Austria after Wagram, and 
in marrying an Austrian princess — " There I stepped on to an 
abyss covered with flowers "; or that again (iii. 79) where he 
represented himself as the natural arbiter in the immense 
struggle of the present against the past, and asserted that in ten 
years' time Europe would be either Cossack or republican. It is 
noteworthy that in Gourgaud's Journal de Ste. Hilbne there are 
very few reflections of this kind and the emperor appears in a guise 
far more life-like. But in the works edited by Montholon and 
Las Cases, where the political aim constantly obtrudes itself, 
the emperor is made again and again to embroider on the -theme 
that he had always been the true champion of ordered freedom.- 
This was the mot d y ordre at Longwood to his companions, who 
set themselves deliberately to propagate it. The folly of the 
monarchs of the Holy Alliance in Europe gained for the writings 
of Montholon and Las Cases (that of Gourgaud was not published 
till 1899) a ready reception, with the result that Napoleon 
reappeared in the literature of the ensuing decades wielding 
an influence scarcely less potent than that of the grey-coated 
figure into whose arms France flung herself on his return from 
Elba. All that he had done for her in the days of the Consulate 
was remembered; his subsequent proceedings — his tyranny, 
his shocking waste of human life, his deliberate persistence in 
war when France and Europe called for a reasonable and lasting j^,^ 
peace — all this was forgotten; and the great warrior, whai lkd^' 
^of ^nce r^iuthg ^sth of May 1821 , was thereafter enshrouded in 
m^tsoflegendthrough whlcITTns form loomed as that of a 
Prometheus condemned to a lingering agony for his devotion 
to the cause of humanity. It was this perversion of fact which " 
rendered possible the career of Napoleon III.

NAPOLEON II., emperor of the French, the style given by 
the Bonapartists to the son of Napoleon I., Napoleon Francis 
Joseph Charles, duke of Reichstadt (g.tf.). The fact that in 
18 1 4, by Napoleon I.'s abdication in his favour, the king of 
Rome (as he was then styled) became for a few days titular 
emperor " by the will of the people," was held *by Prince Louis 
Napoleon to justify his own assumption of the style of Napoleon 
III. which, as seeming to involve a dynastic claim, gave such 
offence to the legitimist powers, notably the emperor Nicholas I. . 
of Russia. 

NAPOLEON III. [Charles Louis Napoleon Bonaparte] 
(1808-1873), emperor of the French, was born on the 20th of 
April 1808 in Paris at 8 rue Cerutti (now rue Laffitte), and not 
at the Tuileries, as the official historians state. -He was the third 
son of Louis Bonaparte (see Bonaparte), brother of Napoleon L, 
and from 1806 to 1810 king of Holland, and of Hortense de 
Beauharnais, daughter of General (de) Beauharnais and Josephine 
Tascher de la Pagerie, afterwards the empress Josephine; hence 
he was at the same time the nephew and the adopted grandson, 
of the great emperor. Of the two other sons of Louis Bonaparte 
and Hortense, the elder, Napoleon Charles (1802-1807), died 
of croup at The Hague; the second, Napoleon Louis (1804-1831), 
died in the insurrection of the Romagna, leaving no children. 
Doubts have been cast on the legitimacy of Louis Napoleon; for 
the discord between Louis Bonaparte, who was ill, restless and 
suspicious, and his pretty and capricious wife was so violent 
and open as to justify all conjectures. But definite evidence, 
in the shape of letters and references in memoirs, enables us 
to deny that the Dutch Admiral Verhuell was the father of Louis 
Napoleon,and there is strong evidence of resemblance in character 
between King Louis and his third son. He early gave signs of a 
grave and dreamy character. Many stories have been told about 
his childhood, for example the remark which Napoleon I, is said 
to have made about him: " Who knows whether the future 
of my race may not lie in this child." It is certain that, after 
the abdication and exile of Louis, Hortense lived in France with 
her two children, in close relation with the imperial court. 
During the Hundred Days, Louis Napoleon, then a child of 
seven, witnessed the presentation of the eagles to 50,000 soldiers; 
but a few weeks later, before his departure for Rochefort, the 
defeated Napoleon embraced him for the last time, and his 
mother had to receive Frederick William III. of Prussia and his 
two sons at the chateau of Saint-Leu; here the victor and the 
vanquished of Sedan met for the first time, and probably played 
together. 

After Waterloo, Hortense, suspected by the Bourbons of having 
arranged the return from Elba, had to go into exile. The ex- 
king Louis, who now lived at Florence, had compelled her by a 
scandalous law-suit to give up to him the elder of her two children. 
With her remaining child she wandered, under the name of 
duchesse de Saint-Leu, from Geneva to Aix, Carlsruhe and 
Augsburg. In 181 7 she bought the castle of Arenenberg, in the 
canton of Turgau, on a wooded hill looking over the Lake of 
Constance. Hortense supervised her son's education in person, 
and tried to form his character. His tutor was Philippe Le Bas, 
son of the well-known member of the Convention and follower 
of Robespierre, an able man, imbued with the ideas of the 
Revolution, while Vieillard, who instructed him in the rudiments, 
was a democratic imperialist also inspired with the ideal of 
nationalism. The young prince also studied at the gymnasium 
at Augsburg, where his love of work and his mental qualities were 
gradually revealed; he was less successful in mathematics than 
in literary subjects, and he became an adept at physical exercises, 
such as fencing, riding and swimming. It was at this time that 
he acquired the slight German accent which he never lost. 
Those who educated him never lost sight of the future; but it 



212 



NAPOLEON III. 



was above all his mother, fully confident of the future destiny 
of the Bonapartes, who impressed on him the idea that he would 
be king, or at any rate, that he would accomplish some great 
works. " With your name," she said, " you will always count for 
something, whether in the old world of Europe or in the new." 
If we may believe Mme Cornu, he already at the age of twelve 
had dreams of empire. 

In 1823 he accompanied his mother to Italy, visiting his father 
at Florence, and his grandmother Letitia at Rome, and dreaming 
with Le Bas on the banks of the Rubicon. He returned to 
Arenenburg to complete his military education under Colonel 
Armandi and Colonel Dufour, who instructed him in artillery 
and military engineering. At the age of twenty he was a 
" Liberal," an enemy of the Bourbons and of the treaties of 181 5; 
but he was dominated by the cult of the emperor, and for him 
the liberal ideal was confused with the Napoleonic. 

The July revolution of 1830, of which he heard in Italy, 
roused all his young hopes. He could not return to France, for 
the law of 1816 banishing all his family had not been abrogated. 
But the liberal revolution knew no frontiers. Italy shared in 
the agitation. He had already met some of the conspirators 
at Arenenberg, and it is practically established that he now 
joined the associations of the Carbonari. Following the advice 
of his friend the Count Arese and of Menotti, he and his brother 
were among the revolutionaries who in February 1831 attempted 
a rising in Romagna and the expulsion of the pope from Rome. 
They distinguished themselves at Civita Castellana, a little 
town which they took; but the Austrians arrived in force, and 
during the retreat Napoleon Louis, the elder son, took .cold, 
followed by measles, of which he died. Hortense hurried to 
the spot and took steps which enabled her to save her second son 
from the Austrian prisons. He escaped into France, where his 
mother, on the plea of his illness, obtained permission from 
Louis Philippe for him to stay in Paris. But he intrigued with 
the republicans, and Casimir-Perier insisted on the departure 
of both mother and son. In May 1831 they went to London, 
and afterwards returned to Arenenberg. 

For a time he thought of responding to the appeal of some of 
the Polish revolutionaries, but Warsaw succumbed (September 
1 831) before he could set out. Moreover the plans of this young 
and visionary enfant du sibcle were becoming more definite. 
The duke of Reichstadt died in 1832. His uncle, Joseph, and 
his father, Louis, showing no desire to claim the inheritance 
promised them by the constitution of the year XII., Louis 
Napoleon henceforth considered himself as the accredited 
representative of the family. Those who came in contact with 
him noticed a transformation in his character; he tried to hide 
his natural sensibility under an impassive exterior, and concealed 
his political ambitions. He became indeed " donx entile " 
(gentle but obstinate) as his mother called him, persistent in 
his ideas and always ready to return to them, though at the 
same time yielding and drawing back before the force of circum- 
stances. He endeavoured to define his ideas, and in 1833 published 
his Reveries politiques, suivies d'un projet de constitution, and 
Considerations politiques et militaires sur la Suisse; in 1836, 
as a captain, in the Swiss service, he published a Manuel 
d'artillerie, in order to win popularity with the French army. 
A phrase of Montesquieu, placed at the head of this work, sums 
up the views of the young theorist: "The people, possessing 
the supreme power, should do for itself all that it is able to do; 
what it cannot do well, it must do through its elected repre- 
sentatives." The supreme authority entrusted to the elect of 
the people was always his essential idea. But the problem was 
how to realize it. Louis Napoleon could feel vaguely the state 
of public opinion in France, the longing for glory from which 
it suffered, and the deep-rooted discord between the nation and 
the king, Louis Philippe, who though sprung from the national 
revolution against the treaties of 1815, was yet a partisan of 
peace at any price. Both Chateaubriand and Carrel had praised 
the prince's first writings. Bonapartists and republicans found 
common ground in the glorious tradition sung by Beranger. 
A military conspiracy like those of Berton or the sergeants 



of La Rochelle, seemed feasible to Napoleon. A new friend of 
his, Fialin, formerly a non-commissioned officer and a journalist, 
an energetic and astute man and a born conspirator, spurred 
him on to action. 

With the aid of Fialin and Eleonore Gordon, a singer, who 
is supposed to have been his mistress, and with the co-operation 
of certain officers, such as Colonel Vaudrey, an old soldier of 
the Empire, commanding the 4th regiment of artillery, and 
Lieutenant Laity, he tried to bring about a revolt of the garrison 
of Strassburg (October 30, 1836). The conspiracy was a failure, 
and Louis Philippe, fearing lest he might make the pretender 
popular either by the glory of an acquittal or the aureole of 
martyrdom, had him taken to Lorient and put on board a ship 
bound for America, while his accomplices were brought before 
the court of assizes and acquitted (February 1837). The prince 
was set free in New York in April; by the aid of a false passport 
he returned to Switzerland in August, in time to see his mother 
before her death on the 3rd of October 1837. 

At any other time this attempt would have covered its author 
with ridicule. Such, at least, was the opinion of the whole of the 
family of Bonaparte. But his confidence was unshaken, and 
in the woods of Arenenberg the romantic-minded friends who 
remained faithful to him still honoured him as emperor. And 
now the government of Louis Philippe, by an evil inspiration, 
began to act in such a way as to make him popular. In 1838 
it caused his partisan Lieutenant Laity to be condemned by the 
Court of Peers to five years' imprisonment for a pamphlet which 
he had written to justify the Strassburg affair; then it demanded 
the expulsion of the prince from Switzerland, and when the Swiss 
government resisted, threatened war. Having allowed the July 
monarch to commit himself, Louis Napoleon at the last moment 
left Switzerland voluntarily. All this served to encourage the 
mystical adventurer. In London, where he had taken up his 
abode, together with Arese, Fialin (says Persigny), Doctor 
Conneau and Vaudrey, he was at first well received in society, 
being on friendly terms with Count d'Orsay and Disraeli, and 
frequenting the salon of Lady Blessington. He met with various 
adventures, being present at the famous tournament given by 
Lord Eglinton, and yielded to the charm of his passionate 
admirer Miss Howard. But it was a studious life, as well as the 
life of a dandy, that he led at Carlton House Terrace. Not for 
a minute did he forget his mission: " Would you beh'eve it," 
the duke of Wellington wrote of him, " this young man will not 
have it said that he is not going to be emperor of the French. 
The unfortunate affair of Strassburg has in no way shaken this 
strange conviction, and his chief thoughts are of what he will 
do when he is on the throne." He was in fact evolving his 
programme of government, and in 1839 wrote and published 
his book: Des IdSes napoUoniennes, a curious mixture of Bona- 
partism, socialism and pacificism, which he represented as the 
tradition of the First Empire. He also followed attentively 
the fluctuations of French opinion. 

Since 1838 the Napoleonic propaganda had made enormous 
progress. Not only did certain newspapers, such as the Capitole 
and the Journal du Commerce, and clubs, such as the Culottes 
de peau carry it on zealously; but the diplomatic humiliation 
of France in the affair of Mehcmet Ali {q.v.) in 1840, with the 
outburst of patriotism which accompanied it, followed by the 
concessions made by the government to public opinion, such as, 
for example, the bringing back of the ashes of Napoleon I., 
all helped to revive revolutionary and Napoleonic memories. 

The pretender, again thinking that the moment had come, 
formed a fresh conspiracy. With a little band of fifty-six followers 
he attempted to provoke a rising of the 42nd regiment of the 
line at Boulogne, hoping afterwards to draw General Magnan 
to Lille and march upon Paris. The attempt was made on the 
6th of August 1840, but failed; he saw several of his supporters 
fall on the shore of Boulogne, and was arrested together with 
Montholon, Persigny and Conneau. This time he was brought 
before the Court of Peers with his accomplices; he entrusted 
his defence to Berryer and Marie, and took advantage of his 
trial to appeal to the supremacy of the people, which he alleged, 



NAPOLEON III. 



213 



had been disregarded, even after 1830. He was condemned 
to detention for life in a fortress, his friend Aladenize being 
deported, and Montholon, Parquin, Lombard and Fialin being 
each condemned to detention for twenty years. On the 15th of 
December, the very day that Napoleon's ashes were deposited at 
the Invalides, he was taken to the fortress of Ham. The country 
seemed to forget him; Lamartine alone foretold that the honours 
paid to Napoleon I. would shed lustre on his nephew. His prison 
at Ham was unhealthy, and physical inactivity was painful 
to the prince, but on the whole the regime imposed upon him 
was mild, and his captivity was lightened by Alexandrine 
Vergeot, " la belle sabotiere" or Mdlle Badinguet (he was later 
nicknamed Badinguet by the republicans). His more intel- 
lectual friends, such as Mme Cornu, also came to visit him and 
assisted him in his studies. He corresponded with Louis Blanc, 
George Sand and Proudhon, and collaborated with the journalists 
of the Left, Degeorge, Peauger and Souplet. For six years 
he worked very hard " at this University of Ham," as he said. 
He wrote some Fragments historiques, studies on the sugar- 
question, on the construction of a canal through Nicaragua, 
and on the recruiting of the army, and finally, in the Progres 
du Pas-de-Calais, a series of articles on social questions which 
were later embodied in his Extinction du paupfrisme (1844). 
But the same persistent idea underlay all his efforts. " The 
more closely the body is confined/' he wrote, " the more the mind 
is disposed to indulge in flights of imagination, and to consider 
the possibility of executing projects of which a more active 
existence would never perhaps have left it the leisure to think." 
On the 25th of May 1846 he escaped to London, giving as the 
reason" for his decision the dangerous illness of his father. On 
the 27th of July his father died, before he could accomplish 
a journey undertaken in spite of the refusal of a passport by 
the representative of Tuscany. 

He was again well received in London, and he " made up for 
his six years of isolation by a furious pursuit of pleasure." The 
duke of Brunswick and the banker Ferrere interested them- 
selves in his future, and gave him money, as did also Miss Howard, 
whom he later made comtesse de Beauregard, after restoring to 
her several millions. He was still full of plans and new ideas, 
always with the same end in view; and for this reason, in spite of 
his various enterprises, which were sometimes ridiculous, some- 
times unpleasant in their consequences, and his unscrupulous- 
ness as to the men and means he employed, he always had a 
kind of greatness. He always retained his faith in his star. 
" They will come to me without any effort of my own," he said 
to Taglioni the dancer; and again to Lady Douglas, who was 
counselling resignation, he replied, " Though fortune has twice 
betrayed me, yet my destiny will none the less surely be fulfilled. 
I wait." He was not to wait much longer. 

As he well perceived, the popularity of his name, the vague 
" legend " of a Napoleon who was at once a democrat, a soldier 
and a revolutionary hero, was his only strength. But by his 
abortive efforts he had not yet been able to win over this immense 
force of tradition and turn it to his own purposes. The events 
which occurred from 1848 to 1852 enabled him to do so. He 
behaved with extraordinary skill, displaying in the heat of the 
conflict all the abilities of an experienced conspirator, knowing, 
" like the snail, how to draw in his horns as soon as he met with 
an obstacle " (Thiers), but supple, resourceful and unscrupulous 
as to the choice of men and means in his obstinate struggle for 
power. 

At the first symptoms of revolutionary disturbance he returned 
to France; on the 25th of February he offered his services to the 
Provisional Government, but, on being requested by it to depart 
at once, resigned himself to this course. But Persigny, Mocquard 
and all his friends devoted themselves to an energetic propaganda 
in the press, by pictures and by songs. After the 15th of May 
had already shaken the strength of the young republic, he was 
elected in June 1848 by four departments, Seine, Yonne, Charente- 
Inf6rieure and Corsica. In spite of the opposition of the executive 
committee, the Assembly ratified his election. But he had learnt 
to wait. He sent in his resignation from London, merely hazard- 



ing this appeal: " If the people impose duties on me, I shall 
know how to fulfil them." This time events worked in his favour; 
the industrial insurrection of June made the middle classes and 
the mass of the rural population look for a saviour, while it 
turned the industrial population towards Bonapartism, out of 
hatred for the republican bourgeois. The Legitimists seemed im- 
possible, and the people turned instinctively towards a Bonaparte. 

On the 26th of September he was re-elected by the same 
departments; on the nth of October the law decreeing the 
banishment of the Bonapartes was abrogated; on the 26th he 
made a speech in the Assembly defending his position as a 
pretender, and cut such a sorry figure that Antony Thouret 
contemptuously withdrew the amendment by which he had 
intended to bar him from rising to the presidency. Thus he was 
able to be a candidate for this formidable power, which had just 
been defined by the Constituent Assembly and entrusted to the 
choice of the people, " to Providence," as Lamartine said. 
In contrast to Cavaignac he was the candidate of the advanced 
parties, but also of the monarchists, who reckoned on doing 
what they liked with him, and of the Catholics, who gave him 
their votes on condition of his restoring the temporal power 
to Rome and handing over education to the Church. The former 
rebel of the Romagna, the Liberal Carbonaro, was henceforth to 
be the tool of the priests. In his very triumph appeared the 
ultimate cause of his downfall. On the 10th of December he 
was elected president of the Republic by 5,434,226 votes against 
1,448,107 given to Cavaignac. On the 20th of December he 
took the oath "to remain faithful to the democratic Republic 
. . . to regard as enemies of the nation all those who may attempt 
by illegal means to change the form of the established govern- 
ment." From this time onward his history is inseparable from 
that of France. But, having attained to power, he still en- 
deavoured to realize his cherished project. All his efforts, from 
the 10th of December 1848 to the 2nd of December 1852 tended 
towards the acquisition of absolute authority, which he wished 
to obtain, in appearance, at any rate, from the people. 

It was with this end in view that he co-operated with the 
party of order in the expedition to Rome for the destruction of 
the Roman republic and the restoration of the pope (March 31, 
1849), and afterwards in all the reactionary measures against the 
press and the clubs, and for the destruction of the Reds. But in 
opposition to the party of order, he defined his own personal 
policy, as in his letter to Edgard Ney (August 16, 1849), which 
was not deliberated upon at the council of ministers, and asserted 
his intention " of not stifling Italian liberty," or by the change 
of ministry on the 31st of October 1849, when, " in order to 
dominate all parties," he substituted for the men coming from 
the Assembly, such as Odilon Barrot, creatures of his own, such 
as Rouher and de Parieu, the Auvergne avocats, and Achille 
Fould, the banker. " The name of Napoleon," he said on this 
occasion, " is in itself a programme; it stands for order, authority, 
religion and the welfare of the people in internal affairs, and in 
foreign affairs for the national dignity." 

In spite of this alarming assertion of his personal policy, he 
still remained in harmony with the Assembly (the Legislative 
Assembly, elected on the 28th of May 1849) in order to carry 
out " a Roman expedition at home," i.e. to clear the administra- 
tion of all republicans, put down the press, suspend the right of 
holding meetings and, above all, to hand over education to the 
Church (law of the 15th of March 1850). But the machiavellian 
pretender, daily growing more skilful at manoeuvring between 
different classes and parties, knew where to stop and how to 
keep up a show of democracy. When the Assembly, by the law 
of the 31st of May 1850, restricted universal suffrage and reduced 
the number of the electors from 9 to 6 millions, he was able to 
throw upon it the whole responsibility for this coup oVUat bour- 
geois. " I cannot understand how you, the offspring of universal 
suffrage, can defend the restricted suffrage," said his friend Mme 
Cornu. " You do not understand," he replied, " I am preparing 
the ruin of the Assembly." " But you will perish with it," she 
answered. " On the contrary, when the Assembly is hanging 
over the precipice, I shall cut the rope."

NAPOLEON III. 



In fact, while trying to compass the destruction of the 
republican movement of the Left, he was taking careful steps to 
gain over all classes. " Prince , altesse, monsieur, monseigneur, 
citoyen " (he was called by all these names indifferently at the 
Elysee), he appeared as the candidate of the most incompatible 
interests, flattering the clergy by his compliments and formal 
visits, distributing cigars and sausages to the soldiers, promising 
the prosperous bourgeoisie " order in the street " and business, 
while he posed as the " father of the workers," and won the hearts 
of the peasants. At his side were his accomplices, men ready for 
anything, whose only hopes were bound up with his fortunes, 
such as Morny and Rouher; his paid publicists, such as Romieu 
the originator of the "red spectre"; his cudgel-bearers, the 
" Ratapoils " immortalized by Daumier, who terrorized the 
republicans. From the Elysee by means of the mass of officials 
whom they had at their command, the conspirators extended their 
activities throughout the whole country. 

He next entered upon that struggle with the Assembly, now 
discredited, which was to reveal to all the necessity for a change, 
and a change in his favour. In January 1851 he deprived 
Changarnier of his command of the garrison of Paris. " The 
Empire has come," said Thiers. The pretender would have pre- 
ferred, however," that it should be brought about] legally, the first 
step being his re-election in 1852. The Constitution forbade his 
re-election; therefore the Constitution must be revised. On the 
19th of July the Assembly threw out the proposal for revision, 
thus signing its own death-warrant, and the coup d'itat was 
resolved upon. He prepared for it systematically. The cabinet 
of the 26th of October 1851 gave the ministry for war to his 
creature Saint-Arnaud. All the conspirators were at their 
posts — Maupas at the prefecture of police, Magnan at the 
head of the troops in Paris. At the Elysee, Morny, adulterine son 
of Hortense, a hero of the Bourse and successful gambler, 
supported his half-brother by his energy and counsels. The 
ministry proposed to abrogate the electoral law of 1850, and 
restore universal suffrage; the Assembly by refusing made itself 
still more unpopular. By proposing to allow the president 
of the Assembly to call in armed force, the questors revealed 
the Assembly's plans for defence, and gave the Elysee a weapon 
against it (" donnent barre contre elle a TElysee "). The propo- 
sition was rejected (November 17), but Louis-Napoleon saw that 
it was time to act. On the 2nd of December he carried out his 
coup d'&tat. 

But affairs developed in a way which disappointed him. By 
dismissing the Assembly, by offering the people " a strong 
government," and re-establishing " a France regenerated by the 
Revolution of '89 and organized by the emperor," he had hoped 
for universal applause. But both in Paris and the provinces 
he met with the resistance of the Republicans, who* had re- 
organized in view of the elections of 1852. He struck at them 
by mixed commissions, deportations and the whole range of 
police measures. The decrets-lois of the year 1852 enabled him 
to prepare the way for the new institutions. On the 1st of 
December 1852 he became in name what he was already in deed, 
and was proclaimed Emperor of the French. He was then 44 
years old. " The impassibility of his face and his lifeless glance " 
showed observers that he was still the obstinate dreamer that 
he had been in youth, absorbed in his Idea. His unshaken 
conviction of his mission made him conscious of the responsibility 
which rested on him, but hid from him the hopeless defect in the 
coup d'itat. To carry out his conviction, he had still only a 
timid will, working through petty expedients; but here again 
his confidence in the future made him bold. In a people politically 
decimated and wearied, he was able to develop freely all the 
. Napoleonic ideals. Rarely has a man been able to carry out 
his system so completely, though perhaps in these first years he 
had to take more disciplinary measures than he had intended 
against the Reds, and granted more favours than was fitting 
to the Catholics, his allies in December 1848 and December 
1858. 

The aim which the emperor had in view was, by a concentration 
of power which should make him " the beneficent motive force 



of the whole social order " (constitution of the 14th of January 
1852; administrative centralization; subordination of the 
elected assemblies; control of the machinery of universal suffrage) 
to unite all classes in " one great national party " attached to the 
dynasty. His success, from 1852 to 1856, was almost complete. 
The nation was submissive, and a few scattered- plots alone 
showed that republican ideas persisted among the masses. 
As " restorer of the overthrown altars," he won over the " men 
in black," among them Veuillot, editor-in-chief of FUnivers, and 
allowed them to get the University into their hands. By the aid 
of former Orleanists, such as Billault, Fould and Morny, and 
Saint-Simonians such as Talabot and the Pereires, he satisfied 
the industrial classes, extended credit, developed means of 
communication, and gave a strong impetus to the business of 
the nation. By various measures, such as subsidies, charitable 
gifts and foundations, he endeavoured to show that " the idea 
of improving the lot of those who suffer and struggle against the 
difficulties of life was constantly present in his mind." His was 
the government of cheap bread, great public works and holidays. 
The imperial court was brilliant. The emperor, having failed to 
obtain the hand of a Vasa or Hohenzollern, married, on the 29th 
of January 1853, Eugenie de Montijo, comtesse de Teba, aged 
twenty-six and at the height of her beauty. 

France was " satisfied " in the midst of order, prosperity and 
peace. But a glorious peace was required; it must not be said 
that " France is bored," as Lamartine had said when the 
Napoleonic legend began to spread. The foreign policy of the 
Catholic party, by the question of the Holy Places and the 
Crimean War (1853-1856), gave him the opportunity of winning 
the glory which he desired, and the British alliance enabled him 
to take advantage of it. In the spring of 1855, as a definite success 
was still slow to come, he contemplated for a time taking the 
lead of the expedition in person, but his advisers dissuaded him 
from doing so, for fear of a revolution. In January 1856 he had 
the good fortune to win a diplomatic triumph over the new tsar, 
Alexander II. It was at Paris (February 25-March 30) that the 
conditions of peace were settled. 

The emperor was now at the height of his power. He appeared 
to the people as the avenger of 1840 and 1815, and the birth to 
him of a son, Eugene Louis Jean Joseph, on the 16th of March 
1856, assured the future of the dynasty. It was then that, 
strong in " the esteem and admiration with which he was sur- 
rounded," and " foreseeing a future full of hope for France," he 
dreamed of realizing the Napoleonic ideal in its entirety. This 
disciple of the German philologists, this crowned Carbonaro, 
the friend of the archaeologists and historians who were to help 
him to write the Histoire de Cisar, dreamed of developing the 
policy of nationalism, and of assisting the peoples of all countries 
to enfranchise themselves. 

From 1856 to 1858 he devoted his attention to the Rumanian 
nationality, and supported Alexander Cuza. But it was above 
all the deliverance of Italy which haunted his imagination. 
By this enterprise, which his whole tradition imposed upon him, 
he reckoned to flatter the amour-propre of his subjects, and rally 
to him the liberals and even the republicans, with their passion 
for propagandism. But the Catholics feared that the Italian 
national movement, when once started, would entail the downfall 
of the papacy; and in opposition to the emperor's Italian 
advisers, Arese and Prince Jerome Napoleon, they pitted the 
empress, who was frivolous and capricious, but an ardent Catholic. 
Napoleon III. was under his wife's influence, and could not openly 
combat her resistance. It was the Italian Orsini who, by 
attempting to assassinate him as a traitor to the Italian nation 
on the 14th of January 1858, gave him an opportunity to impose 
his will indirectly by convincing his wife that in the interests 
of his own security he must " do something for Italy." Events 
followed each other in quick succession, and now began the 
difficulties in which the Empire was to be irrevocably involved. 
Not only did the Italian enterprise lead to strained relations with 
Great Britain, the alliance with whom had been the emperor's 
chief support in Europe, and compromised its credit; but the 
claims of parties and classes again began to be heard at home. 



NAPOLEON III. 



215 



The Italian war aroused the opposition of the Catholics. 
After Magenta (June 4, 1859), it was the fears of the Catholics 
and the messages of the empress which, even more than the 
threats of Prussia, checked him in his triumph and forced him 
into the armistice of Villafranca (July 11, 1859). But the spread 
of the Italian revolution and the movement for annexation 
forced him again to intervene. He appealed to the Left against 
the Catholics, by the amnesty of the 17th of April 1859. His 
consent to the annexation of the Central Italian states, in 
exchange for Savoy and Nice (Treaty of Turin, March 24, i860) 
exposed him to violent attacks on the part of the ultramontanes, 
whose slave he had practically been since 1848. At the same 
time, the free-trade treaty with Great Britain (January 5, 
i860) aroused a movement against him among the industrial 
bourgeoisie. 

Thus at the end of i860, the very time when he had hoped that 
his personal policy was to rally round him once for all the whole 
of France, and assure the future of his dynasty, he saw, on the 
contrary, that it was turning against him his strongest sup- 
porters. He became alarmed at the responsibilities which he saw 
would fall upon him, and imagined that by an appearance of 
reform he would be able to shift on to others the responsibility 
for any errors he might commit. Hence the decrees of the 24th of 
November i860 (right of address, ministers without portfolio) 
and the letter of the 14th of November 1861 (financial reform). 
From this time onward, in face of a growing opposition, anxiety 
for the future of his regime occupied the first place in the 
emperor's thoughts, and paralysed his initiative. Placed 
between his Italian counsellors and the empress, he was ever of 
two minds. His plans for remodelling Europe had a certain 
generosity and grandeur; but internal difficulties forced him into 
endless manoeuvre and temporization, which led to his ruin. 
Thus in October 1862, after Garibaldi's attack on Rome, the 
clerical coterie of the Tuileries triumphed. But the replacing 
of M. Thouvenel by M. Drouin de Lhuys did not satisfy the more 
violent Catholics, who in May 1863 joined the united opposition. 
Thirty-five opposers of the government were appointed, Re- 
publicans, Orleanists, Legitimists or Catholics. The emperor 
dismissed Persigny, and summoned moderate reformers such as 
Duruy and Behic. But he was still possessed with the idea of 
settling his throne on a firm basis, and uniting all France in some 
glorious enterprise which should appeal to all parties equally, and 
" group them under the mantle of imperial glory." From 
January to June 1863 he sought this appearance of glory in 
Poland, but only succeeded in embroiling himself with Russia. 
Then, after Syria and China, it was the " great inspiration of his 
reign," the establishment of a Catholic and Latin empire in 
Mexico, enthusiasm for which he tried in vain from 1863 to 1867 
to communicate to the French. 

But while the strength of France was wasting away at Puebla 
or Mexico, Bismarck was founding German unity. In August 
1864 the emperor, held back by French public opinion, which 
was favourable to Prussia, and by his idea of nationality, allowed 
Prussia and Austria to seize the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein. 
After his failure in Poland and Mexico and hi face of the alarming 
presence of Germany, only one alliance remained possible for 
Napoleon III., namely with Italy. He obtained this by the 
convention of the 15th of September 1864 (involving the with- 
drawal of the French troops from Rome). But the Catholic 
party redoubled its violence, and the pope sent out the encyclical 
Quanta Cura and the Syllabus, especially directed against France. 
In vain the emperor sought in German affairs a definitive solution 
of the Italian question. At Biarritz he prepared with Bismarck 
the Franco-Prussian alliance of April 1866; and hoped to become, 
to his greater glory, arbiter in the tremendous conflict which was 
about to begin. But suddenly, while he was trying to rouse 
public opinion against the treaties of 1815, the news of the battle 
of Koniggratz came as a bolt from the blue to ruin his hopes. 
French interests called for an immediate intervention. But the 
emperor was ill, weary and aged by the life of pleasure which he 
led side by side with his life of work (as is proved by the letters 
to Mdlle Bellanger); he was suffering from a first attack of 



his bladder complaint. He knew, moreover, the insufficiency 
of his troops. After days of terrible suffering, he resigned 
himself to the annexation by Prussia of northern Germany. 
" Now," said M Drouin de Lhuys, " we have nothing left but to 
weep." 

Henceforth the brilliant dream, a moment realized, the realiza- 
tion of which he had thought durable,' was at an end. The 
Empire had still an uncertain and troubled brilliancy at the 
Exhibition of 1867. But Berezowski's pistol shot, which accen- 
tuated the estrangement from the tsar, and the news of the death 
of Maximilian at Queretaro, cast a gloom over the later fetes. 
In the interior the industrial and socialist movement, born of 
the new industrial development, added fresh strength to the 
Republican and Liberal opposition. The moderate Imperialists 
felt that some concessions must be made to public opinion. In 
opposition to the absolutist " vice-emperor " Rouher, whose 
influence over Napoleon had become stronger and stronger since 
the death of Morny, Emile Ollivier grouped the Third Party. 
Anxious, changeable and distraught, the emperor made the 
Liberal concessions of the 19th of January 1867 (right of inter- 
pellation), and then, when Ollivier thought that his triumph 
was near, he exalted Rouher (July) and did not grant the promised 
laws concerning the press and public meetings till 1868. Tfce 
opposition gave him no credit for these tardy concessions. There 
was an epidemic of violent attacks on the emperor; the publica- 
tion of the Lanterne and the Baudin trial, conducted by Gam- 
betta, were so many death-blows to the regime. The Inter- 
nationale developed its propaganda. The election cf May 1869 
resulted in 4,438,000 votes given for the government, and 
3>3 5 5 i°°° for the opposition, who also gained 90 representatives. 
The emperor, disappointed and hesitating, was slow to return to 
a parliamentary regime. It was not till December that he 
instructed Ollivier to " form a homogeneous cabinet representing 
the majority of the Corps Legislatif " (ministry of the 2nd of 
January 1870). But, embarrassed between the Arcadiens, 
the partisans of the absolute regime, and the republicans, 
Ollivier was unable to guide the Empire in a constitutional 
course. At the Tuileries Rouher's counsel still triumphed. It 
was he who inspired the ill and wearied emperor, now without 
confidence or energy, with the idea of resorting to the plebiscite. 
"To do away with the risk of a Revolution," " to place order 
and liberty upon a firm footing," " to ensure the transmission of 
the crown to his son," Napoleon III. again sought the approba- 
tion of the nation. He obtained it with brilliant success, for the 
last time, by 7,358,786 votes against 1,571,939, and his work 
now seemed to be consolidated. 

A few weeks later it crumbled irrevocably. Since 1866 he had 
been pursuing an elusive appearance of glory. Since 1 866 France 
was calling for " revenge." He felt that he could only rally the 
people to him by procuring them the satisfaction of their national 
pride. Hence the mishaps and imprudences of which Bismarck 
made such an insulting use. Hence the negotiations of Nikols- 
burg, the " note d'aubergiste " (innkeeper's bill) claiming the 
left bank of the Rhine, which was so scornfully rejected; hence 
the plan for the invasion of Belgium (August 1866), the Luxem- 
burg affair (March 1867), from which M. de Moustier's diplomacy 
effected such a skilful retreat; hence the final folly which led 
this government into the war with Prussia (July 1870). 

The war was from the first doomed to disaster. It might 
perhaps have been averted if France had had any allies. But 
Austria, a possible ally, could only join France if satisfied as 
regards Italy; and since Garibaldi had threatened Rome 
(Mentana, 1867), Napoleon III., yielding to the anger of the 
Catholics, had again sent troops to Rome. Negotiations had 
taken place in 1869. The emperor, bound by the Catholics, had 
refused to withdraw his troops. It was as a distant but inevitable 
consequence of his agreement of December 1848 with the Catholic 
party that in 1870 the emperor found himself without an ally. 

His energy was now completely exhausted. Successive 
attacks of stone in the bladder had ruined his physique; while 
his hesitation and timidity increased with age. The influence 
of the empress over him became supreme. On leaving the

council in which the war was decided upon the emperor threw 
himself, weeping, into the arms of Princess Mathilde. The 
empress was delighted at this war, which she thought would 
secure her son's inheritance. 

On the 28th of July father and son set out for the army. 
They found it in a state of utter disorder, and added to the 
difficulties by their presence. The emperor was suffering from 
stone and could hardly sit his horse. After the defeat of Reichs- 
hoffen, when Bazaine was thrown back upon Metz, he wished to 
retreat upon Paris. But the empress represented to him that 
if he retreated it would mean a revolution. An advance was 
decided upon which ended in Sedan. On the 2nd of September, 
Napoleon III. surrendered with 80,000 men, and on the 4th of 
September the Empire fell. He was taken as a prisoner to the 
castle of Wilhelmshohe, near Cassel, where he stayed till the 
end of the war. After the intrigues of Bazaine, of Bismarck, 
and of the empress, the Germans having held negotiations 
with the Republic, he was de facto deposed. On the 1st of March 
the assembly of Bordeaux confirmed this deposition, and declared 
him " responsible for the ruin, invasion and dismemberment 
of France." 

Restored to liberty, he retired with his wife and son to 
Chislehurst in England. Unwilling even now to despair of the 
future, he still sought to rally his friends for a fresh propaganda. 
He had at his service publicists such as Cassagnac, J. Amigues 
and Hugelmann. He himself also wrote unsigned pamphlets 
justifying the campaign of 1870. It may be noted that, true to 
his ideas, he did not attempt to throw upon others the responsi- 
bility which he had always claimed for himself. He dreamed 
of his son's future. But he no longer occupied himself with any 
definite plans. He interested himself in pensions for workmen 
and economical stoves. At the end of 1872 his disease became 
more acute, and a surgical operation became necessary. He 
died on the 9th of January 1873, leaving his son in the charge 
of the empress and of Rouher. The young prince was educated 
at Woolwich from 1872 to 1875, and in 1879 took part in the 
English expedition against the Zulus in South Africa, in which 
he was killed. By his death vanished all hope of renewing the 
extraordinary fortune which for twenty years placed the 
descendant of the great emperor, the Carbonaro and dreamer, 
at once obstinate and hesitating, on the throne of France.

NAPOLEON, a round game of cards (known colloquially as 
" Nap "). Any number may play. The cards rank as at whist, 
and five are dealt to each player. The deal being completed, 
the player to the dealer's left looks at his hand and declares 
how many tricks he would play to win against all the rest, the 
usual rule being that more than one must be declared; in default 
of declaring he says " I pass," and the next player has a similar 
option of either declaring to make more tricks or passing, and 
so on all round. A declaration of five tricks is called " going 
Nap." The player who declares to make most has to try to 
make them, and the others, but without consultation, to prevent 
- him. The declaring hand has the first lead, and the first card 
he leads makes the trump suit. The players, in rotation, must 
follow suit if able. If the declarer succeeds in making at least 
the number of tricks he stood for he wins whatever stakes are 
played for; if not he loses. If the player declaring Nap wins 
he receives double stakes all round; if he loses he only pays 
single stakes all round. Sometimes, however, a player is allowed 
to go "Wellington" over "Nap," and even "Blucher" over 



" Wellington." In these cases the caller of " Wellington 9> 
wins four times the stake and loses twice the stake, the caller 
of " Blucher " receives six times and loses three times the stake. 
Sometimes a player is allowed to declare tnisere, i.e. no tricks. 
This ranks, as a declaration, between three and four, but the 
player pays a double stake on three, if he wins a trick, and receives 
a single on three if he takes none. 

NAPOLEONIC CAMPAIGNS.— r. The era of the Revolutionary 
and Napoleonic Wars falls into two main divisions, the first 
of which ( 1 792-1801) is dealt with under the heading French 
Revolutionary Wars. In the present article are described 
the campaigns in central and eastern Europe, directed by 
Napoleon — no longer one amongst many French generals, 
nor even a simple primus inter pares, but " Emperor " in the 
fullest sense — between the years 1805 and 1814. Napoleon'ss 
short Spanish Campaign of 1809 is dealt with under Peninsular 
War (this article covering the campaigns in Spain, Portugal and 
southern France 1808-1814), and for the final drama of Waterloo 
the reader is referred to Waterloo Campaign. 

The campaigns described below are therefore — 

(a) The Austrian War of 1805 (Ulm and Austerlitz). 

(b) The Conquest of Prussia and the Polish Campaign (Jena, 
Auerstadt, Eylau and Friedland). 

(c) The Austrian War of 1809 (Eckrmihl, Aspern and Wagram). 

(d) The Russian War of 1812 (Borodino and the retreat from 

Moscow). 

(e) The German " War of Liberation," culminating in the Battle 

of the Nations around Leipzig. 

(/) The last campaign in France, 1814. 

The naval history of 1803-1815 includes the culmination and the 
sequel of the # struggle for command of the sea which began in 1793 
and reached its maximum intensity on the day of Trafalgar. 

2. The Campaign of 1805 may be regarded as a measure of 
self-defence forced upon Napoleon by the alliance of Russia 
(April nth), Austria (August 9th) and other powers with Great 
Britain. The possibility had long been before the emperor, and 
his intention in that event to march straight on Vienna by the 
valley of the Danube is clearly indicated in his reply (November 
27th, 1803) to a Prussian proposal for the neutralization of the 
South German states. In this he says, "It is on the road from 
Strassburg to Vienna that the French must force peace on 
Austria, and it is this road Which you wish us to renounce." 
When, therefore, on the 25th of August 1805, he learnt definitely 
that Villeneuve (see Naval operations below) had failed in his 
purpose of securing the command of the Channel, which was 
the necessary preliminary to the invasion of England, it was but 
the affair of a few hours to dictate the dispositions necessary to 
transfer his whole army to the Rhine frontier as the first step 
in its march to the Danube. On this date the army actually 
lay in the following positions:— 

I. Corps Bernadotte Hanover (Gottingen) 
II. „ Marmont Holland 

III. „ Davout ^ 

IV. „ Soult I Camp of Boulogne and 
V. „ Lannes [ other points on the 

VI. „ Ney J English Channel 

VII. „ Augereau 
Guard Bessieres Paris. 

The corps were, however, by no means fit for immediate service. 
Bernadotte's corps in Hanover was almost in the position of a 
beleaguered garrison, and the marshal could only obtain his 
transport by giving out that he was ordered to withdraw to 
France. Marmont and Davout were deficient in horses for 
cavalry and artillery, and the troops in Boulogne, having been 
drawn together for the invasion of England, had hardly any 
transport at all, as it was considered this want could be readily 
supplied on landing. The composition of the army, however, was 
excellent. The generals were in the prime of life, had not yet 
learnt to distrust one another, and were accustomed to work 
under the emperor and with one another. The regimental 
officers had all acquired their rank before the enemy and knew 
how to manage their men, and of the men themselves nearly 
two-thirds had seen active service. The strength of the army 
lay in its infantry, for both cavalry and artillery were short of 
horses, and the latter had not yet acquired mobility and skill

in manoeuvring. Napoleon's determination to undertake the 
f invasion of England has often been disputed, but it is hard to 
imagine what other operation he contemplated, for the outbreak 
of hostilities with his continental enemies found him ill-supplied 
with intelligence as to the resources of the country he had then 
to traverse. To remedy this, Murat and other general officers 
as well as minor agents were sent ahead and instructed to travel 
through South Germany in plain clothes with a view to collecting 
information and mastering the topography. The emperor 
was, moreover, imperfectly acquainted with the degree of pre- 
paration of his adversaries' designs, and when he dictated his 
preliminary orders he was still unaware of the direction that 
the allies' advance would assume. That he foresaw the march 
of events which ultimately drew Mack to Ulm is inconceivable. 
On the 26th of August, however, he learnt that 100,000 Russians 
were about to enter Bohemia thence to unite with an Austrian 
army of 80,000 near the junction of the Inn and Danube, and 
this information compelled him to alter the general direction 
of his advance so as to traverse the defiles of the Black Forest 
north of the Neckar, cavalry only observing the passes to the 
south. 

3. Austrian Army.-r-The Austrians after the defeats of 1800 
had endeavoured to reorganize their forces on the French model, 
but they were soon to learn that in matters of organization the 
spirit is everything, the letter very little. They had copied 
the organization of the French corps, but could find no corps 
commanders fit to assume the responsibility for these commands. 
As always in such conditions, the actual control of the smallest 
movements was still centralized in the hands of the army com- 
manders, and thus the rate of marching was incredibly slow. 
They had decided that in future their troops in the field should 
live by requisition, and had handed over to the artillery, which 
needed them badly, a large number of horses thus set free from 
the transport service, but they had not realized that men 
accustomed to a regular distribution of rations cannot be trans- 
formed into successful marauders and pillagers by a stroke of 
the pen; and they had sent away the bulk of their army, 120,000 
under their best general, the archduke Charles, into Italy, leaving 
Lieut. Field Marshal Mack von Leiberich in Germany, nominally 
as chief of the staff to the young Prince Ferdinand, but virtually 
in command, to meet the onset of Napoleon at the head of his 
veterans. Mack was a man of unusual attainments. He had 
risen from the ranks in the most caste-ridden army in Europe, 
and against untold opposition had carried through army reforms 
which were correct in principle, and needed only time to develop. 
It was his fate to be made the scapegoat for the disasters which 
followed, though they need no further explanation than that, 
at the head of 80,000 men and- exercising only restricted powers 
of command, he was pitted against the greatest strategist of all 
ages who was responsible to no overlord and commanded, in the 
fullest sense of the term, an army considerably more than twice 
as strong. 

4. The March on Ulm. — The outbreak of the campaign was 
hastened by the desire of the Austrian government to feed their 
own army and leave a bare country for Napoleon by securing the 
resources of Bavaria. It. was also hoped that the Bavarians 
with their army of 25,000 men would join the allies. In the latter 
hope they were deceived, and the Bavarians under General 
Wrede slipped away to Bamberg in time. In the former, how- 
ever, they were successful, and the destitution they left in their 
wake almost wrecked Napoleon's subsequent combinations. 
Mack's march to Ulm was therefore a necessity of the situation, 
and his continuance in this exposed position, if foolhardy against 
such an adversary, was at any rate the outcome of the high 
resolve that even if beaten he would inflict crippling losses upon 
the enemy. Mack knew that the Russians would be late at the 
rendezvous on the Inn. By constructing an entrenched camp 
at Ulm and concentrating all the available food within it, he 
expected to compel Napoleon to invest and besiege him, and 
he anticipated that in the devastated country his adversary 
would be compelled to separate and thus fall an easy prey to the 
Russians. For that blow he had determined to make his own 



army the anvil. But these views obviously could not be pub- 
lished in army orders, hence the discontent and opposition he was 
destined to encounter. 

5. Movements of the French. — It was on the 21st that Napoleon 
learnt of Mack's presence in Ulm. On that date his army had 
crossed the Rhine and was entering the defiles of the Black 
Forest. It was already beginning to suffer. Boots were worn out, 
greatcoats deficient, transport almost unattainable and, accord- 
ing to modern ideas, the army would have been considered 
incapable of action.

On the 26th of September, its deployment beyond the mountains 
was complete, and as Napoleon did not know of Mack's intention 
to stay at Ulm and had learned that the Russian advance had 
been delayed, he directed his columns by the following roads on 
the Danube, between Donauworth and Ingolstadt, so as to be 
in a position to intervene between the Austrians and the Russians 
and beat both in detail. On the 7th of October this movement 
was completed — the Austrians abandoned the Danube bridges 
after a show of resistance, retreating westward — and Napoleon, 
leaving Murat in command of the V. and VI. corps and cavalry 
to observe the Austrians, pressed on to Augsbuig with the others 
so as to be ready to deal with the Russians. Learning, however, 
that these were still beyond striking radius, he determined to deal 
with Mack's army first, having formed the fixed conviction that 
a threat at the latter's communications would compel him to 
endeavour to retreat southwards towards Tirol. Bernadotte 
in his turn became an army of observation, and Napoleon 
joining Murat with the main body marched rapidly westward 
from the Lech towards the Iller. 

6. Austrian Plans. — Mack's intentions were not what Napoleon 
supposed. He had meanwhile received (false) information of a 
British landing at Boulogne, and he was seriously deceived as to 
the numbers of Napoleon's forces. He was also aware that the 
exactions of the French had produced deep indignation through- 
out Germany and especially 'in Prussia (whose neutrality had 
been violated, see § 14, below) . All this, and the almost mutinous 
discontent of his generals and his enemies of the court circle, 
shook his resolution of acting as anvil for the Russians, of whose 
delay also he was aware, and about the 8th of October he deter- 
mined to march out north-eastward across the French lines of 
communication and save his sovereign's army by taking refuge 
if necessary in Saxony. Believing implicitly in the rumours of a 
descent on Boulogne and of risings in France which also reached 
him, and knowing the destitution he had left behind him in his 
movement to Ulm, when he heard of the westward march of 
French columns from the Lech he told his army, apparently in 
all good faith, that the Fi ench were in full march for their own 
country. 

Actually the French at this moment were suffering the most 
terrible distress — up to the Danube they had still found sufficient 
food for existence, but south of it, in the track of the Austrians, 
they found nothing. All march discipline disappeared, the men 
dissolved into hordes of marauders and even the sternest of the 
marshals wrote piteous appeals to the emperor for supplies, and 
for permission to shoot some of their stragglers. But to all these 
Berthier in the emperor's name sent the stereotyped reply — 
" The emperor has ordered you to carry four days' provisions, 
therefore you can expect nothing further— you know the 
emperor's method of conducting war." 

7. Action of Albeck or Haslack. — Meanwhile Murat, before the 
emperor joined him, had given Mack the desired opening. 
The VI. corps (Ney) should have remained on the left bank of 
the Danube to close the Austrian exit on that side, but by mistake 
only Dupont's division had been left at Albeck, the rest being 



2l8 



NAPOLEONIC CAMPAIGNS 




Emery W*lkcrst 



brought over the river. Mack on the 8th had determined to 
commence his withdrawal, but fortune now favoured the French. 
The weather during the whole of October had been unusually 
wet, the swollen Danube overflowed the low ground and the 
roads had become quagmires. On the south bank, owing to 
better natural drainage and a drier subsoil, movement was fairly 
easy, but the Austrians found it almost impossible. On the nth 
of October, when they began their march, the road along the 
Danube was swept into the river, carrying with it several guns 
and teams, and hours were consumed in passing the shortest 
distances. At length in the afternoon they suddenly fell upon 
Dupont's isolated division at Albeck, which was completely 
surprised and severely handled. The road now lay completely 
open, but the Austrian columns had so opened out owing to 
the state of the roads that the leading troops could not pursue 
their advantage — Dupont rallied and the Austrians had actually 
to fall back towards Ulm to procure food. 

8. Elchingen. — For three more days Mack struggled with an 
unwilling staff and despondent men to arrange a further advance. 
During these very three days, through a succession of staff 
blunders, the French failed to close the gap, and on the morning 
of the 14th of October both armies, each renewing their advance, 
came in contact at the bridge of Elchingen. This bridge, all 



but a few road-bearers, had been destroyed, but now the French 
gave an example of that individual gallantry which was char- 
acteristic of the old revolutionary armies. Running along the 
beams under a close fire a few gallant men forced their way 
across. The floor of the bridge was rapidly relaid, and presently 
the whole of the VI. corps was deploying with unexampled 
rapidity on the farther side. The Austrians, still in their quag- 
mire, could not push up reinforcements fast enough, and though 
Mack subsequently alleged deliberate obstruction and dis- 
obedience on the part of his subordinates, the state of the roads 
alone suffices to explain their defeat. Only the right column of 
the Austrians was, however, involved; the left under General 
Werneck, to whom some cavalry and the archduke Ferdinand 
attached themselves, did indeed succeed in getting away, but 
without trains or supplies. They continued their march, famished 
but unmolested, until near Heidenheim they suddenly found 
themselves confronted by what from the diversity of uniforms 
they took to be an overwhelming force; at the same time the 
French cavalry sent in pursuit appeared in their rear. Utterly 
exhausted by fatigue, Werneck with his infantry, some 8000 
strong, surrendered to what was really a force of dismounted 
dragoons and foot-sore stragglers improvised by the commanding 
officer on the spot to protect the French treasure chests, which at 



NAPOLEONIC CAMPAIGNS

that moment lay actually in the path of the Austrians. The 
young archduke with some cavalry escaped. 

9. Mack surrounded. — The defeat at Elchingen on the 14th of 
October sealed the fate of the Austrians, though Mack was still 
determined to endure a siege. As the French columns coming 
up from the south and west gradually surrounded him, he drew 
in his troops under shelter of the fortress and its improvised 
entrenched camp, and on the 15th he found himself completely 
surrounded. On the 16th the French field-guns fired into the 
town, and Mack realized that his troops were no longer under 
sufficient control to endure a siege. When, therefore, next 
morning, negotiations were opened by the French, Mack, still 
feeling certain that the Russians were at hand, agreed to an 
armistice and undertook to lay down his arms if within' the next 
twenty-one days no relief should arrive. To this Napoleon 
consented, but hardly had the agreement been signed than he 
succeeded in introducing a number of individual French soldiers 
into the fortress, who began rioting with the Austrian soldiery. 
Then, sending in armed parties to restore order and protect the 
inhabitants, he caused the guards at the gates to be overpowered, 
and Mack was thus forced into an unconditional surrender. 

On the 22nd of October, the day after Trafalgar, the remnant 
of the Austrian army, 23,000 strong, laid down its arms. About 
5000 men under Jellachich had escaped to Tirol, 2000 cuirassiers 
with Prince Ferdinand to Eger in Bohemia, and about 10,000 
men under Werneck, had surrendered at Heidenheim. The 
losses in battle having been insignificant, there remain some 
30,000 to account for — most of whom probably escaped individu- 
ally by the help of the inhabitants, who were bitlerly hostile to 
the French. 

10. Napoleon's Advance to Vienna. — Napoleon now hastened 
to rejoin the group of corps he had left under Bernadotte in 
observation towards the Russians, for the latter were nearer 
at hand than even Mack had assumed. But hearing of his 
misfortune they retreated before Napoleon's advance along the 
right bank of the Danube to Krems, where they crossed the river 
and withdrew to an entrenched camp near Olmtitz to pick up 
fresh Austrian reinforcements. The severe actions of Diirrenstein 
(near Krems) on the nth, and of Hollabriinn on the 16th of 
November, in which Napoleon's marshals learned the tenacity 
of their new opponents, and the surprise of the Vienna bridge 
(November 14) by the French, were the chief incidents of 
this period in the campaign. 

11. Campaign of Austerlitz. — Napoleon continued down the 
right bank to Vienna, where he was compelled by the con- 

dition of his troops to call a halt to refit his army. 
After this was done he continued his movement to 
Briinn. Thither he succeeded in bringing only 55,000 men. 
He was again forced to give his army rest and shelter, under 
cover of Murat's cavalry. The allies now confronted him with 
upwards of 86,000 men, including 16,000 cavalry. About the 
20th of November this force commenced its advance, and 
Napoleon concentrated in such a manner that within three days 
he could bring over 80,000 French troops into action around 
Briinn, besides 17,000 or more Bavarians under Wrede. On 
the 28th Murat was driven in by the allied columns. That night 
orders were despatched for a concentration on Briinn in expecta- 
tion of a collision on the following day; but hearing that the 
whole allied force was moving towards him he decided to con- 
centrate south-east of Briinn, covering his front by cavalry on 
the Pratzen heights. Meanwhile he had also prepared a fresh 
line of retreat towards Bohemia, and, certain now of having 
his men in hand for the coming battle, he quietly awaited 
events. 

The allies were aware of his position, and still adhering to the 
old " linear " system, marched to turn his right flank (see 
Austerlitz). As soon as their strategic purpose of cutting him 
off from Vienna became apparent, the emperor moved his troops 
into position, and in the afternoon issued his famous proclamation 
to his troops, pointing out the enemy's mistakes and his plan for 
defeating them. At the same time he issued his orders for his 
first great battle as a supreme commander. The battle of 



Austerlitz began early next morning and closed in the evening 
with the thorough and decisive defeat of the allies. 

12. Jena, 1806. — Around the Prussian army, and particularly 
the cavalry, the prestige of Frederick the Great's glory still 
lingered; but the younger generation had little 
experience of actual warfare, and the higher com- ^^ p ^i gttt 
manders were quite unable to grasp the changes in 

tactics and in the conduct of operations which had grown out 
of the necessities of the French Revolution. The individual 
officers of the executive staff were the most highly trained in 
Europe, but there was no great leader to co-ordinate their 
energies. The total number of men assigned to the field army 
was 110,000 Prussians and Saxons. They were organized in 
corps, but their leaders were corps commanders only in name, 
for none were allowed any latitude for individual initiative. 
Ill-judged economies had undermined the whole efficiency of 
the Prussian army. Two-thirds of the infantry and one-half of 
the cavalry were allowed furlough for from ten to eleven months 
in the year. The men were unprovided with greatcoats. Most 
of the muskets had actually seen service in the Seven Years' War, 
and their barrels had worn so thin with constant polishing that 
the use of full charges at target practice had been forbidden. 
Above all, the army had drifted entirely out of touch with the 
civil population. The latter, ground down by feudal tradition and 
law, -and at the same time permeated by the political doctrines 
of the late 18th century, believed that war concerned the govern- 
ments only, and formed no part of the business of the " honest 
citizen." In this idea they were supported by the law itself, 
which protected the civilian against the soldier, and forbade 
even in war-time the requisitioning of horses, provisions and 
transport, without payment. Up to the night of the battle of 
Jena itself, the Prussian troops lay starving in the midst of plenty, 
whilst the French everywhere took what they wanted. This 
alone was a sufficient cause for all the misfortunes which followed. 

13. Outbreak of the War. — During the campaign of Austerlitz 
Prussia, furious at the violation of her territory of Anspach, 
had mobilized, and had sent Haugwitz as ambassador to 
Napoleon's headquarters. He arrived on the 30th of November, 
and Napoleon, pleading business, put off his official reception 
till after the battle of Austerlitz. Of course the ultimatum was 
never presented, as may be imagined; Haugwitz returned and 
the king of Prussia demobilized at once. But Napoleon, well 
knowing the man he had to deal with, had determined to force 
a quarrel upon Prussia at the earliest convenient opportunity. 
His troops therefore, when withdrawn from Austria, were can- 
toned in south Germany in such a way that, whilst suspicion 
was not aroused in minds unacquainted with Napoleonic methods, 
they could be concentrated by a few marches behind the 
Thuringian forest and the upper waters of the Main. Here the 
Grand Army was left to itself to recuperate and assimilate its 
recruits, and it is characteristic of the man and his methods 
that he did not trouble his corps commanders with a single 
order during the whole of the spring and summer. 

As the diplomatic crisis approached, spies were sent into 
Prussia, and simultaneously with the orders for preliminary con- 
centration the marshals received private instructions, the pith 
of which cannot be better expressed than in the following two 
quotations from Napoleon's correspondence: — 

" Mon intention est de concentrer toutes mes forces sur Textr6mit6 
de ma droite en laissant tout Tespace entre le Rhin et Bamberg 
entierement degarni, de maniere a avoir pres de 200,000 horn mes 
reunis sur un meme champ de bataille; mes premieres marches 
'menacent le coeur de la monarchic prussienne " (No. 10,920). 
" Avec cette immense sup€riorite de forces reunis sur un espace si 
etroit, vous sentez gue je suis dans la volont6 de ne rien hasarder et 
d'attaquer Tenncmi partout ou il voudra tenir. Vous pensez bien 
que ce serait une belle affaire que de se porter sur cette place (Dresden) 
en un bataitlon carrb de 200,000 homtnes " (Soult, No. 10,941). 

14. Advance of the Grande Armte. — On the 7th of October 
the Grande Armte lay in three parallel columns along the roads 
leading over the mountains to Hof, Schleiz and Kronach; 
on the right lay the IV. corps (Soult) about Bayreuth; with his 
cavalry in rear, and behind these the VI. corps (Ney) at Pegnitz; 
in the centre, Bernadotte's I. corps from Nordhalben, with the 



220 



NAPOLEONIC CAMPAIGNS 



III. corps (Davout) Lichtenfels; Guard and headquarters, 
Bamberg. The left column was composed of the V. (Lannes) 




at Hemmendorf, with the VII. (Augereau) extending south to 
the Main at Burgebrach. 

Napoleon's object being surprise, all the cavalry except a 
few vedettes were kept back behind the leading infantry columns 
and these latter were ordered to advance, on the signal being 
given, in " masses of manoeuvre," so as to crush at once any 
outpost resistance which was calculated upon the time required 
for the deployment of ordinary marching columns. This order 
has never since found an imitator, but deserves attentive study 
as a masterpiece (see H. Bonnal, Manoeuvre d'Hna). 

To meet the impending blow the Prussians had been extended 
in a cordon along the great road leading from Mainz to Dresden, 
Blucher was at Erfurt, Riichel at Gotha, Hohenlohe at Weimar, 
Saxons in Dresden, with outposts along the frontier. An 
offensive move into Franconia was under discussion, and for 
'this purpose the Prussian staff had commenced a lateral con- 
centration about Weimar, Jena and Naumburg when the storm 
burst upon them. The emperor gathered little from the confused 
reports of their purposeless manoeuvres, but, secure in the midst 
of his " battalion square " of 200,000 men, he remained quite 
indifferent, well knowing that an advance straight on Berlin 
must force his enemy to concentrate and fight, and as they 
would bring at most 127,000 men on to the battlefield the 
result could hardly be doubtful. On the 9th of October the cloud 
burst. Out of the forests which clothe the northern slopes of 
the Thuringer Wald the French streamed forth, easily over- 
powering the resistance of the Prussian outposts on the upper 
Saale, 1 and once the open country was reached the cavalry under 
Murat trotted to the front, closely followed by Bernadottc's 
corps as " general advance guard." The result of the cavalry 
scouting was however unsatisfactory. On the night of the 10th, 

1 At the action of Saalfeld on the 10th, the young and gallant 
Prince Louis Ferdinand of Prussia was killed. 



the emperor was still unaware of the position of his principal 
foe, and Murat with Bernadotte behind him was directed on 
Gera for the nth, the remainder of the army con- 
tinuing along the roads previously assigned to 
them. 

In the meanwhile, however, the Saxons had been 
moving from Naumburg through Gera on Jena, 
Hohenlohe was near Weimar, and all the other 
divisions of the army had closed in a march 
eastwards, the idea of an offensive to the south- 
ward which Napoleon had himself attributed to 
them having already disappeared. 

Reaching Gera at 9 a.m. Murat reported the 
movement of the Saxons on the previous day, 
but omitted to send a strong detachment in 
pursuit. The traces of the Saxons were lost, and 
Napoleon, little satisfied with his cavalry, author- 
ized Lasalle to offer up to 6000 frs. reward for 
information of the Prussian point of concentration. 
At 1 a.m. of the 1 2th Napoleon issued his orders. 
Murat and Bernadotte via Zeitz to Naumburg; 
Davout (III. corps and a dragoon division) also to 
Naumburg; Lannes to Jena, Augereau following; 
Soult to Gera. 

15. Prussian Movements. — In the meantime 
the Prussians were effecting their concentration. 
Riichel, who with 15,000 men had been sent into 
the mountains as an advanced guard for the pro- 
jected offensive, was recalled to Weimar, which 
he reached on the 13th. The main body were 
between Weimar and Apolda during the 12th, and 
the Saxons duly effected their junction with 
Hohenlohe in the vicinity of Vierzehnheiligen, 
whilst the latter had withdrawn his troops all but 
some outposts from Jena to the plateau about 
Capellendorf, some 4 m. to the N.W. The whole 
army, upwards of 120,000 men, could therefore have 
been concentrated against Lannes and Augereau by 
the afternoon of the 13th, whilst Soult could only 
have intervened very late in the day, and Davout and Berna- 
dotte were still too distant to reach the battlefield before the 
14th. All the French corps, moreover, were so exhausted by 
their rapid marches over bad roads that the emperor actually 
ordered (at 1 a.m. on the 13th) a day of rest for all except 
Davout, Bernadotte, Lannes and Murat. 

The Prussian headquarters, however, spent the 12th and 13th 
in idle discussion, whilst the troop commanders exerted them- 
selves to obtain some alleviation for the suffering of their 
starving men. The defeats undergone by their outpost detach- 
ment had profoundly affected the nerves of the troops, and 
on the afternoon of the nth, on the false alarm of a French 
approach, a panic broke out in the streets of Jena, and it took 
all the energy of Hohenlohe and his staff to restore order. On 
the morning of the 12th the Saxon commanding officers 
approached Hohenlohe with a statement of the famishing 
condition of their men, and threatened to withdraw them 
again to Saxony. Hohenlohe pointed out that the Prussians 
were equally badly off, but promised to do his best to help 
his allies. Urgent messages were sent off to the Commissary 
von Goethe (the poet), at Weimar for permission to requisition 
food and firewood. These requests, however, remained 
unanswered, and the Prussians and Saxons spent the night 
before the battle shivering in their miserable bivouacs. 

16. The 13th of October. — During the early morning of the 13th 
the reports brought to Napoleon at Gera partially cleared up 
the situation, though the real truth was very different from 
what he supposed. However, it was evident that the bulk of 
the Prussians lay to his left, and instructions were at once 
despatched to Davout to turn westward from Naumburg towards 
Kosen and to bring Bernadotte with him if the two were still 
together. The letter, however, ended with the words " but I 
hope he is already on his way to Dornburg." Now Bernadotte 



Emery Walker, sc. 



NAPOLEONIC CAMPAIGNS 



221 



had neglected to keep the emperor informed as to his where- 
abouts. He was still with Davout, but, concluding that he had 
missed an order directing him to Dornburg, he thought to conceal 
his error by assuming the receipt of the order evidently alluded 
to in the last words, and as a result he marched towards Dorn- 
hurg, and his whole corps was lost to the emperor at the crisis 
of the next day's battle. 

On the road from Gera to Jena Napoleon was met by 
intelligence from Lannes announcing his occupation of Jena and 
the discovery of Prussian troops to the northward. Knowing the 
emperor's methods, he wisely restrained the ardour of his sub- 
ordinates and asked for instructions whether to attack or wait. 
The emperor rode forward rapidly, reached Jena about 3 p.m., 
and with Lannes proceeded to the Landgrafenberg to reconnoitre. 
From this point his view was, however, restricted to the im- 
mediate foreground, and he only saw the camps of Hohenlohe's 
left wing. At this moment the Prussians were actually on 
parade and ready to move off to attack, but just then the " evil 
genius " of the Prussian army, von Massenbach, an officer of the 
Headquarter Staff, rode up and claiming to speak with the 
authority of the king and commander-in-chief, induced Hohen- 
lohe to order his troops back to camp. Of all this Napoleon 
saw nothing, but from all reports he came to the conclusion that 
the whole Prussian army was actually in front of him, and at 
once issued orders for his whole army to concentrate towards 
Jena, marching all night if need be. Six hours earlier his con- 
clusion would have been correct, but early that morning the 
Prussian headquarters, alarmed for the safety of their line of 
retreat on Berlin by the presence of the French in Naumburg, 
decided to leave Hohenlohe and Ruchel to act as rear-guard, 
and with the main body to commence their retreat towards 
the river Unstrutt and the Eckhardtsberge where Massenbach 
had previously reconnoitred an " ideal " battlefield. This belief 
in positions was the cardinal principle of Prussian strategy 
in those days. The troops had accordingly commenced their 
march on the morning of the 13th, and now at 3 p.m. were settling 
down into bivouac; they were still but a short march from the 
decisive field. 

17. Battle of Jena. — On the French side, Lannes' men were 
working their hardest, under Napoleon's personal supervision, 
to make a practicable road up to the Landgrafenberg, and all 
night long the remaining corps struggled through darkness 
towards the rendezvous. By daybreak on the 14th, the anni- 
versary of Elchingen, upwards of 60,000 men stood densely 



battalions were sent forward, and these, delaying their advance 
till the fog had sufficiently lifted, were met by French skirmishers, 
and small columns, who rapidly overlapped their flanks and 
drove them back in confusion. Hohenlohe now brought up the 
remainder of his command, but in the meanwhile the French 
had poured across the neck between the Landgrafenberg and the 
main plateau, and the troops of Soult and Augereau were working 
up the ravines on either hand. In view of these troops the 
Prussian line, which had advanced faultlessly as if on parade, 
halted to prepare its bayonet attack by fire, and, once halted, it 
was found impossible to get them to go on again. The French 
who had thrown themselves into houses, copses, &c, picked off 
the officers, and the flanks of the long Prussian lines swayed and 
got into confusion. The rival artilleries held each other too 
thoroughly to be able to spare attention to the infantry, whilst 
the Prussian cavalry, which had forgotten how to charge in 
masses of eighty or more squadrons, frittered away their strength 
in isolated efforts. By 10 a.m. the fourteen battalions which had 
initiated this attack were outnumbered by three to one, and 
drifted away from the battlefield. Their places were taken by 
a fresh body, but this was soon outnumbered and outflanked 
in its turn. By 2 p.m. the psychic moment had come, and 
Napoleon launched his guards and the cavalry to complete the 
victory and initiate the pursuit. RucheFs division now arrived 
and made a most gallant effort to cover the retreat, but their 
order being broken by the "torrent of fugitives, they were soon 
overwhelmed by the tide of the French victory and all organized 
resistance had ceased by 4 p.m. 

Briefly summarized, the battle came to this — in four successive 
efforts the Prussians failed because they were locally out- 
numbered. This was the fault of their leaders solely, for, except 
for the last attack, local superiority was in each case attainable. 
Organization and tactics did not affect the issue directly, for the 
conduct of the men and their junior officers gave abundant proof 
that in the hands of a competent leader the " linear " principle of 
delivering one shattering blow would have proved superior to that 
of a gradual attrition of the enemy here, as on the battlefields of 
the Peninsula and at Waterloo, and this in spite of other defects 
in the training of the Prussian infantry which simultaneously 
caused its defeat on the neighbouring field of Auerstadt. 

18. Battle of Auerstadt. — Here the superiority of French 
mobility, a consequence of their training and not necessarily of 
their system, showed its value most conclusively. Davout in 
obedience to his orders of the previous morning was marching 




packed on the narrow plateau of the mountain, whilst, below 
in the ravines on either flank, Soult on the right, and Augereau 
on the left, were getting into position. Fortunately a dense 
fog hid the helpless masses on the Landgrafenberg from sight of 
the Prussian gunners. Hohenlohe had determined to drive the 
French into the ravine at daybreak, but had no idea as to the 
numbers in front of him. FoT want of room, only a few Prussian 



Mnxrj V*Ik*r tc. 



over the Saale at Kosen, when his advanced guard came in 
contact with that of the Prussian main army. The latter with 
at least 50,000 men was marching in two columns, and ought 
therefore to have delivered its men into line of battle twice as 
fast as the French, who had to deploy from a single issue, and 
whose columns had opened out in the passage of the Kosen 
defile and the long ascent of the plateau above. But the Prussians 



222 



NAPOLEONIC CAMPAIGNS 



attacked at the old regulation speed of seventy-five paces to 
the minute, and the French manoeuvred at the quick or double 
of 1 20 or 150. The consequence was that the French always 
succeeded in reinforcing their fighting line in time to avert 
disaster. Nevertheless by mid-day their strength was well-nigh 
exhausted, whilst the Prussian reserve, eighteen battalions 
of guards under Kalckreuth, stood intact and ready to engage. 
But at the critical moment the duke of Brunswick fell mortally 
wounded, and Scharnhorst, his chief of the staff, was at the 
time absent on another part of the field. Meanwhile rumours 
from the battle-field at Jena, magnified as usual, began to 
reach the staff, and these may possibly have influenced 
Kalckreuth, for when appealed to to attack with his eighteen 
battalions and win the day, he declined to move without the 
direct order of the commander-in-chief to do so, alleging that 
it was the duty of a reserve to cover the retreat and he 
considered himself personally responsible to the king for the 
guards entrusted to his care. Even then the day might have 
been saved had Blucher been able to find even twenty squadrons 
accustomed to gallop together, but the Prussian cavalry had 
been dispersed amongst the infantry commands, and at the 
critical moment it proved impossible for them to detiver a 
united and decisive attack. 

Seeing further efforts hopeless, Scharnhorst in the duke's 
name initiated the retreat and the troops withdrew N.W. 
towards Buttelstedt, almost unmolested by the French, who 
this day had put forth all that was in them, and withstood 
victoriously the highest average punishment any troops of the 
new age of warfare had as yet endured. So desperate had been 
their resistance that the Prussians unanimously stated Davout's 
strength at double the actual figure. Probably no man but 
Davout could have got so much out of his men, but why was he 
left unsupported? 

Bernadotte, we have seen, had marched to Dornburg, or 
rather to a point overlooking the ford across the Saale at the 
village of that name, and reached there in ample time to intervene 
on either field. But with the struggle raging before him he 
remained undecided, until at Jena the decision had clearly 
fallen, and then he crossed the river and arrived with fresh 
troops too late for their services to be required. 

19. Prussian Retreat. — During the night the Prussians con- 
tinued their retreat, the bulk of the main body to Sommerda, 
Hohenlohe's corps towards Nordhausen. The troops had got 
much mixed up, but as the French did not immediately press 
the pursuit home, order was soon re-established and a combined 
retreat was begun towards the mouth of the Elbe and Liibeck. 
Here help was expected to arrive from England, and the tide 
might yet have turned, for the Russian armies were gathering 
in the east. It was now that the results of a divorce of the army 
from the nation began to be felt. Instead of seizing all provisions 
and burning what they could not remove, the Prussian generals 
enforced on their men the utmost forbearance towards the 
inhabitants, and the fact that they were obeyed, in spite of the 
inhumanity the people showed to their sick and wounded country- 
men, proves that discipline was by no means so far gone as has 
generally been believed. The French marching in pursuit were 
received with open arms, the people even turning their own 
wounded out of doors to make room for their French guests. 
Their servility awakened the bitterest contempt of their con- 
querors and forms the best excuse for the unparalleled severity 
of the French yoke. On the 26th of October Davout reached 
Berlin, having marched 166 m. in twelve days including two 
sharp rearguard actions, Bernadotte with his fresh troops having 
fallen behind. The inhabitants of Berlin, headed by their mayor, 
came out to meet him, and the newspapers lavished adulation 
on the victors and abuse on the beaten army. On the 28th 
Murat's cavalry overtook the remnant of Prince Hohenlohe's 
army near Prenzlau (N. of Berlin) and invited its capitulation. 
Unfortunately the prince sent Massenbach to discuss the situa- 
tion, and the latter completely lost his head. Murat boasted 
that he had 100,000 men behind him, and on his return Massen- 
bach implored his chief to submit to an unconditional surrender, 



advice which the prince accepted, though as a fact Murat's 
horses were completely exhausted and he had no infantry what- 
ever within call. Only Blucher now remained in the field, and he 
too was driven at length into Liibeck with his back to the sea. 

20. Campaigns in Poland and East Prussia. — Hitherto the 
French had been operating in a rich country, untouched for • 
half a century past by the ravages of war, but as the necessity 
for a campaign against the Russians confronted the emperor, 
he realized that his whole supply and transport service must 
be put on a different footing. After the wants of the cavalry 
and artillery had been provided for, there remained but little 
material for transport work. Exhaustive orders to organize 
the necessary trains were duly issued, but the emperor seems to 
have had no conception of the difficulties the tracks — there were 
no metalled roads — of Poland were about to present to him. 
Moreover, it was one thing to issue orders, but quite another 
to ensure that they were obeyed, for they entailed a complete 
transformation in the mental attitude of the French soldier 
towards all that he had been taught to consider his duties in 
the field. Experience only can teach the art of packing wagons 
and the care of draught animals, and throughout the campaign 
the small pomes of Poland and East Prussia broke down by 
thousands from over loading and unskilful packing. 

21. The Russian Army formed the most complete contrast 
to the French that .it is possible to imagine. Though clad, 
armed and organized in European fashion, the soldiers retained 
in a marked degree the traditions of their Mongolian forerunners, 
their transport wagons were in .type the survival of ages of 
experience, and their care for their animals equally the result 
of hereditary habit. The intelligence of the men and regimental 
officers was very low, but on the other hand service was practically 
for life, and the regiment the only home the great majority had 
ever known. Hence obedience was instinctive and initiative 
almost undreamt of. Moreover, they were essentially a war- 
trained army, for even in peace time their long marches to and 
fro within the empire had most thoroughly inured them to hard- 
ship and privation. Napoleon might have remembered his own 
saying, " La misere est Pecole du bon soldat." In cavalry they 
were weak, for the Russian does not take kindly to equitation 
and the horses were not equal to the accepted European standard 
of weight, while the Cossack was only formidable to stragglers 
and wounded. Their artillery was numerous and for the most 
part of heavy calibre — 18- and 24-pounders were common — but 
the strength of the army lay in its infantry, with its incomparable 
tenacity in defence and its blind confidence in the bayonet in 
attack. The traditions of Suvarov and his victories in Italy 
(see French Revolutionary Wars) were still fresh, but there 
was no longer a Suvarov to lead them. 

22. Advance to the Vistula. — Napoleon had from the first been 
aware of the secret alliance between Prussia and Russia, sworn 
by their respective sovereigns over the grave of Frederick the 
Great, and this knowledge had been his principal reason for 
precipitating hostilities with the former. He remained, however, 
in complete ignorance of the degree of preparation attained on 
the Russian side, and since the seizure of Warsaw together with 
the control of the resources of Poland in men and material its 
occupation would afford, was the chief factor in his calculation, 
he turned at once to the eastward as soon as all further organized 
resistance in Prussia was ended by the surrender of Prenzlau 
and Liibeck. Scarcely leaving his troops time to restore their 
worn-out footgear, or for the cavalry to replace their jaded 
horses from captured Prussian resources, he set Davout in motion 
towards Warsaw on the 2nd of November, and the remainder of 
the army followed in successive echelons as rapidly as they could 
be despatched. 

The cavalry, moving well in advance, dispersed the Prussian 
dep6ts and captured their horses, as far as the line of the Vistula, 
where at last they encountered organized resistance from the 
outposts of Lestocq's little corps of 15,000 men — all that was 
left of Frederick the Great's army. These, however, gave way 
before the threat of the advancing French and after a few 
trifling skirmishes. Davout entered Warsaw on the 30th of 



NAPOLEONIC CAMPAIGNS 



223 



November, being followed by the V., IV. and Guard corps during 
the succeeding fortnight, whilst the VI. and VII. weie echeloned 
to their left, and the VIII. (Mortier) and IX. (Jerome Napoleon) 
and X. (Lefebvre), all new formations since the outbreak of 
the war, followed some marches in the rear. Jerome's corps was 
composed of the Bavarians, Wiirttembergers and Badensers. 

Behind these all Prussia was overrun by newly formed units, 
(3rd and 4th battalions) raised from depot companies, conscripts 
for 1807, and old soldiers rejoining after sickness or wounds. 
Napoleon caused these to be despatched to the front immediately 
after their formation. He had much territory to occupy, and 
in the long march of on an average 85 days, he considered that 
they could be organized, equipped and drilled en route, 

23. Pultusk. — The Russians meanwhile had been moving slowly 
forward in two bodies, one under Bennigsen (50,000), the other 
under Buxhowden (25,000), and the French being at this time 
in Warsaw, they took up threatening positions about Pultusk, 
Plock and Prassnitz. From this triangle they harried the French 
communications with Berlin, and to secure a winter's rest for 
his men Napoleon determined to bring them to action. On the 
23rd of December operations were commenced, but the difficulties 
of securing information and maintaining communication between 
the respective columns, so unlike what any of the French had 
previously encountered, led to a very partial success. The idea 
had been to induce the Russians to concentrate about Pultusk 
and, turning their position from its left, ultimately to cut them 
off from Russia, and if possible to surround them. But in this 
new and difficult country the emperor found it impossible to time 
his marches. The troops arrived late at their appointed positions, 
and after a stubborn rearguard action at Pultusk itself and 
undecisive fighting elsewhere (Soldau-Golymin) the Russians 
succeeded in retreating beyond the jaws of the French attack, 
and Napoleon for the first time found that he had exceeded the 
limit of endurance of his men. Indeed, the rank and file bluntly 
told him as much as he rode with the marching columns. Yield- 
ing to the inevitable, but not forgetting to announce a brilliant 
victory in a bulletin, he sent his troops into winter quarters 
along the Passarge and down the Baltic, enjoining on his corps 
commanders most strictly to do nothing to disturb their 
adversary. 

24. Campaign of Eylau. — Bennigsen, now commanding the 
whole Russian army which with Lestocq's Prussians amounted 




Enter? W*lfcr» «c 



to 100,000, also moved into winter quarters in the triangle 
Deutsch-Eylau-Osterode-Allenstein, and had every intention 



of remaining there, for a fresh army was already gathering in 
Russia, the 1st corps of which had reached Nur about 50 m. 
distant from the French right. 

Unfortunately, Ney with his VI. corps about Gilgenberg had 
received the most poverty-stricken district in the whole region, 
and to secure some alleviation for the sufferings of his men he 
incautiously extended his cantonments till they came in contact 
with the Russian outposts. Apparently seeing in this movement 
a recommencement of hostilities, Bennigsen concentrated his 
troops towards his right and commenced an advance westwards 
towards Danzig, which was still in Prussian hands. Before his 
advance both Ney and Bernadotte (the latter, between Ney and 
the Baltic, covering the siege of Danzig) were compelled to fall 
back. It then became necessary to disturb the repose of the 
whole army to counter the enemy's intentions. The latter by 
this movement, however, uncovered his own communication 
with Russia, and the emperor was quick to seize his opportunity. 
He received the information on the 28th of January. His orders 
were at once issued and complied with with such celerity that 
by the 31st he stood prepared to advance with the corps of Soult, 
Ney, Davout and Augereau, the Guard and the reserve cavalry 
(80,000 men on a front of 60 m.) from Myszienec through 
Wollenberg to Gilgenberg; whilst Lannes on his right towards 
Ostrolenka and Lefebvre (X.) at Thorn covered his outer 
flanks. 

Bernadotte, however, was missing, and this time through 
no fault of his own. His orders and the despatch conveying 
Napoleon's instructions fell into the hands of the Cossacks, and 
just in time Bennigsen 's eyes were opened. Rapidly renouncing 
his previous intentions, he issued orders to concentrate on 
Allenstein; but -this point was chosen too far in advance and he 
was anticipated by Murat and Soult at that place on the 2nd of 
February. He then determined to unite his forces at Joukendorf, 
but again he was too late. Soult and Murat attacked his rear- 
guard on the 3rd, and learning from his Cossacks that the French 
corps were being directed so as to swing round and enclose him, 
he withdrew by a night march and ultimately succeeded in 
getting his whole army, with the exception of von Lestocq's 
Prussians, together in the strong position . along the Alle, the 
centre of which is marked by Preussisch-Eylau. The oppor- 
tunity for this concentration he owed to the time gained for him 
by his rearguard at Joukendorf, for this had stood just long 
enough to induce the French columns to swing in to surround 
him, and the next day was thus lost to the emperor as his corps 
had to extend again to their manoeuvring intervals. The truth 
is that the days were too short and the roads too bad for Napoleon 
to carry out the full purpose his "general advanced guard" 
was intended to fulfil. It was designed to hold the*enemy in 
position by the vigour of its attack, thus neutralizing his inde- 
pendent will power and compelling him to expend his reserves in 
the effort to rescue the troops engaged. But in forests and 
snowdrifts the French made such slow progress that no sufficient 
deployment could be made until darkness put a stop to the 
fighting. Thus, when late on the 7th of February 1807 Murat 
and Soult overtook the enemy near Eylau {q.v .) the fighting was 
severe but not prolonged. This time, however, Bennigsen, with 
over 60,000 men in position and 15,000 Prussians expected to 
arrive next morning, had no desire to avoid a battle, and deployed 
for action, his front protected by great batteries of guns, many 
of them of heavy calibre, numbering some 200 in all. 

During the night Augereau and the Guards had arrived, and 
Ney and Davout were expected on either flank in the fore- 
noon. This time the emperor was determined his enemy should 
not escape him, and about 8 a.m. ordered Soult and Augereau 
on the left and right respectively to assail the enemy, Murat 
and the Guards remaining in the centre as reserve. Napoleon's 
own forces thus became the " general advanced guard " for Ney 
and Davout, who were to close in on either side and deliver the 
decisive stroke. But here too the weather and the state of the 
roads operated adversely, for Ney came up too late, while Davout, 
in the full tide of his victorious advance, was checked by the 
arrival of Lestocq, whose corps Ney had failed to intercept, 



224 



NAPOLEONIC CAMPAIGNS 



and the attack of Augereau's corps (VII.), made in a hlinding 
snowstorm, failed with the appalling loss of over 40% killed 
and wounded. Augereau himself was severely wounded, and the 
remnant of his corps was subsequently distributed amongst the 
other corps. Bennigsen, however, drew off on Ney's arrival, 
and the French were too much exhausted to pursue him. Again 
the emperor had to admit that his troops could do no more, and 
bowing to necessity, he distributed them into winter quarters, 
where, however, the enterprise of the Cossacks, who were no 
strangers to snow and to forests, left the outposts but little 
repose. 

A protracted period of rest followed, during which the emperor 
exerted himself unremittingly to re-equip, reinforce and supply 
his troops. Hitherto he had been based on the entrenched camp 
of Warsaw, but he had already taken steps to organize a new line 
of supply and retreat via Thorn, and this was now completed. 
At the same time Lefebvre was ordered to press the siege of 
Danzig with all vigour, and on the 5th of May, after a most 
gallant resistance, Kalckreuth, who redeemed here his failure of 
Auerstadt, surrendered. English assistance came too late. 
By the beginning of June the French had more than made good 
their losses and 210,000 men were available for field service. 

25. Heilsberg and Friedland. — Meanwhile Bennigsen had 
prepared for a fresh undertaking, and leaving Lestocq with 
20,000 Prussians and Russians to contain Bernadotte, who lay 
between Braunsberg and Spandau on the Passarge, he moved 
southwards on the 2nd, and on the 3rd and 4th of June he fell 
upon Ney, driving him back towards Guttstadt, whilst with the 
bulk of his force he moved towards Heilsberg, where he threw 
up an entrenched position. It was not till the 5th that Napoleon 
received tidings of his advance, and for the moment these were 
so vague that he contented himself by warning the remainder of 
his forces to be prepared to move on the 6th. Next day, however, 
all doubts were set at rest, and as the Russians advanced south 
of Heilsberg, he decided to wheel his whole force to the right, 
pivoting on the III. corps, arid cut Bennigsen off from Konigsberg 
and the sea. On the 8th the VI., III., VIII. and Guard corps, 
together with a new cavalry reserve corps under Lannes, in all 
147,000, stood ready for the operation, and with Murat and 
Soult as general advanced guard the whole moved forward, 
driving the Russian outposts before them. Bernadotte, who was 
to have attacked Lestocq, again failed to receive his orders and 
took no part in the following operations. 

Murat attacked the Russians, who had halted in their 
entrenched position, on the nth and drove in their outposts, 
but did not discover the entrenchments. Meanwhile Soult 
had followed with his infantry in close support, and the emperor 
himself arriving, ordered him to attack at once. Now the 
Russians uncovered their entrenchments, and in the absence of 
artillery preparation Soult's leading troops received most severe 
punishment. Fresh troops arriving were sent in to his support, 
but these also proved insufficient, and darkness alone put an 
end to the struggle, which cost the French 12,000 killed and 
wounded. 

Bennigsen, however, learning that his right was threatened by 
the III. corps, and not having as yet completed his concentration, 
retreated in the night to Bartenstein, and the following day 
turned sharp to right towards Schippenbeil. The emperor 
now pressed on towards Friedland, where he would completely 
control the Russian communications with Konigsberg, their 
immediate base of supply, but for once the Russians outmarched 
him and covered their movement so successfully that for the 
next three days he seems to have completely lost all knowledge 
of his enemy's whereabouts. Lestocq in the meantime had been 
forced northwards towards Konigsberg, and Soult with Murat 
was in hot pursuit. The III., VL, VIII. and Guard corps followed 
the main road towards Konigsberg, and the former had reached 
Muhlhausen, the remainder were about Preussisch-Eylau, 
when Latour Maubourg's dragoons sent in intelligence which 
pointed to the presence of Bennigsen about Friedland. This 
was indeed the case. The Russians after passing Schippenbeil 
had suddenly turned northwards, and on the evening of the 



13th were taking up a strong position on the river Alle with 
Friedland as a centre. 

What followed presents perhaps the finest instance of the 
Napoleonic method. The enemy lay direct to his right, and 
Murat, the IV. and III. corps had well overshot the mark. 
Lannes's reserve corps (cavalry), to whom Latour Maubourg 
reported, lay at Domnau some 10 m. to the right. The latter at 
once assumed ther61e of advanced guard cavalry and was ordered 
to observe the enemy at Friedland, Ney following in close 
support. Davout was turned about and directed on the enemy's 
right, and the VIII. corps (Mortier), the Guards and the reserve 
cavalry followed as main body. On the 14th (the anniversary 
of Marengo) Lannes carried., out his rdle of fighting advanced 
guard or screen, the emperor 's^main. body gradually came up, 
and the battle of 'Friedland (q.$$, notable chiefly for the first 
display of the new artillery tactics ^of "the French, ended with 
a general attack about 5 p.m. and the retreat 'of the Russians, 
after severe losses, over the Alle. Lestocq was, meanwhile, 
driven through Konigsberg (which surrendered on the 15th) 
on Tilsit, and now that he was no longer supported by the 
Russians, the Prussian commander gave up the struggle. 

26. The Austrian Army in i8oq. — Ever since Austerlitz the 
Austrian officers had been labouring to reconstitute and reform 
their army. The archduke Charles was the foremost amongst 
many workers who had realized that numbers were absolutely 
needed to confront the new French methods. With these 
numbers it was impossible to attain the high degree of individual 
efficiency required for the old line tactics, hence they were com- 
pelled to adopt the French methods of skirmishers and columns, 
but as yet they had hardly realized the increased density 
necessary to be given to a line of battle to enable it to endure the 
prolonged nervous strain the new system of tactics entailed. 
Where formerly 15,000 men to the mile of front' had been con- 
sidered ample for the occupation of a position or the execution 
of an attack, double that number now often proved insufficient, 
and their front was broken before reinforcements could arrive. 
Much had been done to create an efficient staff, but though the 
idea of the army corps command was now no new thing, the 
senior generals entrusted with these commands were far from 
having acquired the independence and initiative of their French 
opponents. Hence the extraordinary slowness of their man- 
oeuvres, not because the Austrian infantry were bad marchers, 
but because the preparation and circulation of orders was still 
far behind the French standard. The light cavalry had been 
much improved and the heavy cavalry on the whole proved a 
fair match for their opponents. 

27. The French Army. — After. the peace of Tilsit the Grand 
Army was gradually withdrawn behind the Rhine, leaving only 
three commands, totalling 63,000 men, under Davout in Prussia, 
Oudinot in west central Germany, and Lefebvre in Bavaria, to 
assist the princes of the Confederation of the Rhine in the main- 
tenance of order and the enforcement of the French law of con- 
scription, which was rigorously insisted on in all the States 
comprised in this new federation. 

In exchange for the subsistence of the French troops of* 
occupation, a corresponding numher of these new levies were 
moved to the south of France, where they commenced to arrive 
at the moment when the situation in Spain became acute. The 
Peninsular War (q.v.) called for large forces of the old Grande 
Armie and for a brief period Napoleon directed operations in 
person; and the Austrians took advantage of the dissemination 
and weakness of the French forces in Germany to push forward 
their own preparations with renewed energy. 

But they reckoned without the resourcefulness of Napoleon. 
The moment news of their activity reached him, whilst still in 
pursuit of Sir John Moore, he despatched letters to all the 
members of the Confederation warning them that their con- 
tingents might soon be required, and at the same time issued a 
series of decrees to General Clarke, his war minister, authorizing 
him to call up the contingent of 1 810 in advance, and directing 
him in detail to proceed with the formation of 4th and 5th 
battalions for all the regiments across the Rhine. By these 



NAPOLEONIC CAMPAIGNS 



225 



means Davout's, Oudinot's and Lefebvre's commands were 
augmented, whilst in February and March new corps were formed 
and rapidly pushed towards the front. 

On his return from Spain, seeing war imminent, he issued a 
series of march orders (which deserve the closest study in detail) 
by which on the 15th of April his whole army- was to be con- 
centrated for manoeuvres between Regensburg, Landshut, Augs- 
burg and Donauworth, and sending on the Guard in wagons to 
Strassburg, he despatched Berthier to act as commander-in-chief 
until his own arrival.

28. Austrian Offensive. — The position of assembly was ex- 
cellently chosen, but unfortunately the Austrians took the 
initiative. On the gth of April their main body of six corps 
crossed the Inn between Braunau and Passau, and simultane- 
ously two additional corps moved from Pilsen in Bohemia on 
Regensburg. At this moment Davout was entering Regens- 
burg with his leading troops, the remainder still some marches 
in rear, and it was evident that the whole concentration 
could no longer be carried out before the Austrians would be 
in a position to intervene. Berthier received the news while still 
on his way to the front, and quite failed to grasp the situation. 
Reaching Donauworth at 8 p.m. on the 13th of April, he ordered 
Davout and Oudinot to remain at Regensburg, whilst Lefebvre 
and Wrede (Bavarians) who had fallen back before the Austrians 
were directed to reoccupy Landshut. This was in direct contra- 
diction with the instructions Napoleon had given him on the 
28th of March in view of this very emergency. Davout obeyed, 
but remonstrated. On the 16th Berthier went on to Augsburg, 
where he learnt that Lefebvre 's advanced troops had been 
driven out of Landshut, thus opening a great gap seventy-six 
miles wide between the two wings of the French army. 
Meanwhile Napoleon, who had left Paris at 4 a.m. on the 
13th of April, was hastening towards the front, but remained 
still in ignorance of Berthier's doings until on the 16th at Stutt- 
gart he received a letter from the Marshal dated the 13th, which 
threw him into consternation. In reply he immediately wrote : 
P You do not inform me what has rendered necessary such an 
extraordinary measure which weakens and divides my troops " — 
and — " I cannot quite grasp the meaning of your letter yet, I 
should have preferred to see my army concentrated between 
Ingolstadt and Augsburg, the Bavarians in the first line, with 
the duke of Danzig in his old position, until we know what the 
enemy is going to do. Everything would be excellent if the duke 
of Auerstadt had been at Ingolstadt and the duke of Rivoli 
with the Wurttembergers and Oudinot's corps at Augsburg, 
... so that just the opposite of what should have been 
done has been done " (C. N. to Berthier, Ludwigsburg, 16th 
April). 

29. Napoleon takes command. — Having despatched this severe 
reprimand he hastened on to Donauworth, where he arrived at 
4 a.m. on the 17th, hoping to find Berthier, but the latter was at 
Augsburg. Nevertheless, at ro a.m. he ordered Davout and 
Oudinot to withdraw at once to Ingolstadt; and Lefebvre and 
Wrede on the right to support the movement. About noon 

xix. 8 



Berthier returned and after hearing his explanation Massena 
received orders to move from Augsburg towards Ingolstadt. 
" To-morrow will be a day of preparation spent in drawing 
closer together, and I expect to be able by Wednesday to 
manoeuvre against the enemy's columns according to 
circumstances." 

Meanwhile the Austrians had approached so near that by a 
single day's march it would have been possible to fall upon and 
crush by superior numbers either wing of the French army, 
but though the Austrian light cavalry successfully covered the 
operations of the following troops they had not yet risen to a 
conception of their reconnoitring mission, and the archduke, 
in ignorance of his opportunity and possessed, moreover, with 
the preconceived idea of uniting at Regensburg with the two 
corps coming from Bohemia, moved the bulk of his forces in 
that direction, leaving only a covering body against Davout 
altogether insufficient to retain him. Davout, however, had 
left a garrison of 1800 men in Regensburg, who delayed the 
junction of the Austrian wings until the 20th hist., and on the 
same day the emperor, having now reunited his whole right 
wing and centre, overwhelmed the covering detachments 
facing him in a long series of disconnected engagements lasting 
forty-eight hours, and the archduke now found himself in danger 
of being forced back into the Danube. But with the Bohemian 
reinforcements he had still four corps in hand, and Napoleon, 
whose intelligence service in the difficult and intersected country 
had lamentably failed him, had weakened his army by detaching 
a portion of his force in pursuit of the beaten right wing, and 
against the archduke's communications. 

30. Eckmiihl. — When, therefore, the latter, on the 22nd, 
marched southward to reopen his communications by the defeat 
of the enemy's army, always the surest means of solving this 
difficulty, he actually reached the neighbourhood of Eckmiihl 
with a sufficient numerical superiority had he only been prompt 
enough to seize his opportunity. But the French had been 
beforehand with him. Napoleon, who had personally taken part 
in the fighting of the previous day, and followed the pursuit as 
far as Landshut, whence he had despatched Massena to follow 
the retreating Austrians along the Isar, seems to have realized 
about 3 a.m. in the morning that it was not the main body of 
the enemy he had had before him, but only its left wing, and that 
the main body itself must still be northward towards Regensburg. 
Issuing orders to Davout, Oudinot and his cavalry to concentrate 
with all speed towards Eckmiihl, he himself rode back along the 
Regensburg road and reached the battle-field just as the engage- 
ment between the advance troops had commenced. Had the 
Austrians possessed mobility equal to that of the French the 
latter should have been overwhelmed in detail, but whilst the 
French covered 17 and 19 m. the Austrians only marched 10, 
and, owing to the defect in their tactical training alluded to above, 
the troops actually on the ground could not hold out long enough 
for their reserves to arrive. The retreat of the front lines 
involved the following ones in confusion, and presently the 
whole mass was driven back in considerable disorder. It 
seemed as if nothing " could save the Austrians from complete 
disaster, but at the critical moment the emperor, yielding to 
the protestations of his corps commanders, who represented the 
excessive fatigue of their troops, stopped the pursuit, and the 
archduke made the most of his opportunity to restore order 
amongst his demoralized men, and crossed to the north bank 
of the Danube during the night. 

31. Austrian Retreat. — On the following morning the French 
reached Regensburg and at once proceeded to assault its 
medieval walls, but the Austrian garrison bravely defended it 
till the last of the stragglers was safely across on the north bank. 
It was here that for the only time in his career Napoleon was 
slightly wounded. Then, leaving Davout to observe the archduke's 
retreat, the emperor himself rode after Massena, who with the 
major portion of the French army was following the Austrian 
weaker wing under Hiller. The latter was not so shaken as 
Napoleon believed, and turning to bay inflicted a severe check 
on its pursuers, who at Ebelsberg lost 4000 men in three 



226 



NAPOLEONIC CAMPAIGNS 



fruitless assaults. Thus covered by his rearguard Hiller gained 
space and time to pass his troops over to the north bank of the 
Danube and remove all boats on the river. This left the direct 
road to Vienna open, and Napoleon, hoping to find peace in the 
enemy's capital, pushed the whole of his army down the right 
bank, and with Murat's cavalry entered the city on the 12th of 
May, after somewhat severe resistance lasting three days. Mean- 
while the archduke and Hiller, both now unmolested, effected 
their junction in the vicinity of Wagram, picketing the whole line 
of the Danube with their outposts and collecting all the boats. 

32. Aspern and Wagram. — The reconnaissance of the river 
was at once taken in hand by the French upon their arrival 
in Vienna, and a point opposite the island of Lobau selected 
for the crossing. Thanks to the Austrian precautions it took 
four days to collect the necessary material to span the main 
branch of the river, here some 2000 yds. across, and though 
Napoleon personally spurred on all to activity nearly four days 
more were required for its construction. It was not till the night 
of the 19th of May that orders for the passage were finally issued, 
and during the night the troops commenced to occupy the island 
of Lobau. Surprise, of course, was out of the question, but the 
Austrians did not attempt to dispute the passage, their object 
being to allow as many French as they felt they could deal with 
to pass over and then to fall on them. Thus on the 21st of 
May the battle of Aspern (q.v.) or Essling began. It ended on 
the night of the 22nd with the complete defeat of Napoleon, 
the first ever inflicted upon him. The French retreated into the 
island of Lobau. By nightfall upwards of 100,000 men, en- 
cumbered with at least 20,000 wounded, were crowded together 
on the little island scarcely a mile square, short of provisions 
and entirely destitute of course of all hospital accessories. The 
question then arose whether the retreat was to be continued 
across the main stream or not, and for the second time in his 
career Napoleon assembled his generals to take their opinion. 
They counselled retreat, but having heard them all he replied, 
in substance: " If we leave here at all we may as well retire to 
Strassburg, for unless the enemy is held by the threat of further 
operations he will be free to strike at our communications and 
has a shorter distance to go. We must remain here and renew 
operations as soon as possible." 

Immediate orders were despatched to summon every available 
body of troops to concentrate for the decisive stroke. Practically 
the lines of communication along the Danube were denuded 
of combatants, even Bernadotte being called up from Passau, 
and the viceroy of Italy, who driving the archduke Johann before 
him (action of Raab) had brought up 56,000 men through 
Tirol, was disposed towards Pressburg within easy call. The 
arsenal of Vienna was ransacked for guns, stores and appliances, 
and preparations in the island pushed on as fast as possible. 
By the end of June 200,000 troops were stationed within call, 
and on the 4th July the French began to cross over to the left 
bank of the Danube. The events which followed are described 
under Wagram. The great battle at this place, fought on the 
5th and 6th of July, ended in the retirement of the Austrians. 
The only other event which occurred before peace was made 
was an unimportant action at Znaym on the nth of July. 

33. The Russian War of 1812. — Whilst the campaign of 1800 
had seriously shaken the faith of the marshals and the higher 
ranks in the infallibility of the emperor's judgment, and the 
slaughter of the troops at Aspern and Wagram had still further 
accentuated the opposition of the French people to conscription, 
the result on the fighting discipline of the army had, on the 
whole, been for good. The panics of Wagram had taught men 
and officers alike a salutary lesson. 

Aware of the growing feeling against war in France, Napoleon 
had determined to make his allies not only bear the expenses of 
the coming campaign, but find the men as well, and he was 
so far master of Europe that of the 363,000 who on the 24th of 
June crossed the Niemen no less than two-thirds were Germans, 
Austrians, Poles or Italians. But though the battlefield discipline 
of the men was better, the discipline in camp and on the march 
was worse, for the troops were no longer eager to reach the 



battlefield, and marched because they were compelled, not of 
their own goodwill. The result was apparent in a sudden 
diminution in mobility, and a general want of punctuality 
which in the event very seriously influenced the course of the 
campaign. On the other hand, the Russians, once their father- 
land was invaded, became dominated by an ever-growing spirit 
of fanaticism, and they were by nature too obedient to their 
natural leaders, and too well inured to the hardships of cam- 
paigning, to lose their courage in a retreat. 

34. The Strategic Deployment. — By the middle of June 1812 
the emperor had assembled his army along the line of the Niemen. 
On " the extreme right stood the Austrian contingent under 
Schwarzenberg (34,000 men). Next, centring about Warsaw, 
a group of three corps (19,000 men) under the chief command 
of Napoleon's brother Jerome. Then the main army under 
Napoleon in person (220,000 men; with 80,000 more under the 
viceroy of Italy on his right rear); and on the extreme left at 
Tilsit a flanking corps, comprising the Prussian auxiliary corps 
and other Germans (in all 40,000 strong). The whole army 
was particularly strong in cavalry; out of the 450,000, So,ooo 
belonged to that arm, and Napoleon, mindful of the lessons of 
1807, had issued the most minute and detailed orders for the 
supply service in all its branches, and the forwarding of reinforce- 
ments, no less than 100,000 men being destined for that purpose 
in due course of time. 

Information about the Russians was very indifferent; it was 
only known that Prince Bagration with about 33,000 men lay 
grouped about Wolkowysk; Barclay de Tolly with 40,000 about 
Vilna; and on the Austrian frontier lay a small corps under 
Tormassov in process of formation, while far away on the Turkish 
frontiers hostilities with the sultan retained Tschitschagov with 
50,000 more. Of the enemy's plans Napoleon knew nothing, 
but, in accordance with his usual practice, the position he had 
selected met all immediate possible moves. 

35. Opening of the Campaign. — On the 24th of June the passage 
of the Niemen began in torrid heat which lasted for a few days. 
The main army, with the emperor in person, covered hy Murat 
and the cavalry, moved on Vilna, whilst Jerome on his right rear 
at once threatened Bagration and covered the emperor's outer 
flank. From the very first, however, the inherent weakness of 
the vast army, and the vicious choice of time for the beginning 
of the advance, began to make itself felt. The crops being still 
green, and nothing else available as forage for the horses, an 
epidemic of colic broke out amongst them, and in ten days the 
mounted arms had lost upwards of one-third of their strength; 
men died of sunstroke in numbers, and serious straggling began. 
Still everything pointed to the concentration of the Russians at 
Vilna, and Jerome, who on the 5th of July had reached Grodno, 
was ordered to push on. But Jerome proved quite inadequate 
to his position, listening to the complaints of his subordinates as 
to want of supplies and even of pay; he spent four whole days 
in absolute inertia, notwithstanding the emperor's reprimands. 
Meanwhile the Russians made good their retreat — Barclay to- 
wards the entrenched camp of Drissa on the Dvina, Bagration 
towards Mohilev. 

The emperor's first great coup thus failed. Jerome was 
replaced by Davout, and the army resumed its march, this time 
in the hope of surrounding and overwhelming Barclay, whilst 
Davout dealt with Bagration. The want of mobility, particularly 
in the cavalry, now began to tell against the French. With horses 
only just recovering from an epidemic, they proved quite unequal 
to the task of catching the Cossacks, who swarmed round them 
in every direction, never accepting an engagement but compelling 
a constant watchfulness for which nothing in their previous 
experience had sufficiently prepared the French. 

Before their advance, however, the Russian armies steadily 
retired, Barclay from Vilna via Drissa to Vitebsk, Bagration 
from Wolkowysk to Mohilev. Again arrangments were made 
for a Napoleonic battle; behind Murat 's cavalry came the 
" general advanced guard " to attack and hold the enemy, whilst 
the main body and Davout were held available to swing in on 
his rear. Napoleon, however, failed to allow for the psychology 



NAPOLEONIC CAMPAIGNS 



227 



of his opponents, who, utterly indifferent to the sacrifice of life, 
refused to be drawn into engagements to support an advance 
or to extricate a rearguard, and steadily withdrew from every 
position when the French gained touch with them. 

Thus the manoeuvre against Vitebsk again miscarried, and 
Napoleon found himself in a far worse position, numerically and 
materially, " than at the outset of the campaign. Then he had 
stood with 420,000 men on a front of 160 m., now he had only 
229,000 men on a front of 135; he had missed three great 
opportunities of destroying hi? enemy in detail, and in five weeks, 
during which time he had only traversed 200 m., he had seen his 
troops reduced numerically at least one-third, and, worse still, 
his army was now far from being the fighting machine it had been 
at the outset. 

$6. Smolensk, — Meanwhile the Russians had not lost a single 
gun and the moral of their men had been improved .by the result 
of the many minor encounters with the enemy; further, the 



and then began a series of rearguard actions and nocturnal 
retreats which completely accomplished their purpose of wearing 
down the French army. The Russian government, however, 
failed to see the matter in its true light, and Marshal Kutusov 
was sent to the front to assume the chief command. His inten- 
tion was to occupy a strong position and fight one general action 
for the possession of Moscow, and to this end he selected the line of 
the Kalatscha where the stream intersects the great Moscow road. 
37. Borodino. — Here he was overtaken by Murat and Ney, but 
the French columns had straggled so badly that four whole days 
elapsed before the emperor was able to concentrate his army for 
battle and then could only oppose 128,000 men to the Russians 7 
110,000. About 6 a.m. the battle began, but Napoleon was 
suffering from one of those attacks of illness and depression 
which henceforth became such an important factor in his fate. 
Till about midday he followed the course of the action with his 
usual alertness; then he appears to have been overcome by a 




junction of Bagration and Barclay was now assured in the vicinity 
of Smolensk. Towards this place the French advance was now 
resumed, and the Russian generals at the head of a united force 
of 130,000 men marched forward to meet them. Here, however, 
the inefficiency of the Russian staff actually saved them from 
the disaster which must certainly have overtaken them had they 
realized their intention of fighting the French. The Russians 
marched in two columns, which lost touch of one another, and 
as it was quite impossible for either to engage the French single- 
handed, they both retired again towards Smolensk, where with 
an advanced guard in the town itself — which possessed an old- 
fashioned brick enceinte not to be breached by field artillery alone 
— the two columns reunited and deployed for action behind the 
unfordable Dnieper. 

Murat and Ney as " general advanced guard " attacked the 
town in the morning of the 16th of August, and whilst they 
fought the main body was swung round to attack the Russian 
left and rear. The whole of the 1 7th was required to complete the 
movement, and as soon as its purpose was sufficiently revealed 
to the Russians the latter determined to retreat under cover of 
night. Their manoeuvre was carried out with complete success, 



kind of stupor and allowed his marshals to fight by themselves. 
There was no final decisive effort as at Wagram and the Guard 
was not even called on to move. Ultimately the sun went down 
on an undecided field on which 25,000 French and 38,000 Russians 
had fallen, but the moral reaction on the former was far greater 
than on the latter. 

38. Moscow. — Kutusov continued his retreat, and Murat 
with his now exhausted horsemen followed as best he might. 
Sebastiani, commanding the advanced guard, overtook the 
Russians in the act of evacuating Moscow, and agreed with the 
latter to observe a seven hours' armistice to allow the Russians to 
clear the town, for experience had shown the French that street 
fighting in wooden Russian townships always meant fire and the 
consequent destruction of much-needed shelter and provisions. 
Towards nightfall Napoleon reached the scene, and the Russians 
being now clear the troops began to enter, but already fires were 
observed in the farther part of the city. Napoleon passed the 
night in a house in the western suburb and next morning rode 
to the Kremlin, the troops moving to the quarters assigned 
to them, but in the afternoon a great fire began and, continuing 
for two days, drove the French out into the country again.

NAPOLEONIC CAMPAIGNS 



The emperor was now in the direst perplexity. Kutusov was 
hovering on the outskirts of the city, his main body at Kaluga, 
some marches to the S.W., where he was in full communication 
with the richest portion of the empire; and now news arrived 
that St. Cyr, who had relieved Macdonald on his extreme left, 
had only 17,000 men left under arms against upwards of 40,000 
Russians under Witgenstein; and to the south Tschitschagov's 
army, being no longer detained on the Turkish frontier, peace 
having been made, was marching to join Tormassov about 
B rest-Li tewski with forces which would bring the total of the 
two well over 100,000 men. Meanwhile Schwarzenberg's force 
opposing these had dwindled to a bare 30,000. 

The French army was thus disposed almost in an equilateral 
triangle with sides of about 570 m., with 95,000 men at the apex 
at Moscow opposed to 120,000, 30,000 about Brest opposite 
100,000, and 17,000 about Drissa confronted by 40,000, whilst in 
the centre of the base at Smolensk lay Victor's corps, about 
30,000. From Moscow to the Niemen was 550 m. In view of 
this situation Napoleon on the 4th of October sent General 
Lauriston to the Russian headquarters to treat. Whilst waiting 
his return Murat was enjoined to skirmish with Kutusov, and 
the emperor himself worked out a scheme to assume the offensive 
with his whole army towards St Petersburg, calling in Victor and 
St Cyr on the way. This project was persisted with, until on the 
1 8th Murat was himself attacked and severely handled (action 
of Tarutino or Vinkovo). On the morning of the 19th the whole 
army moved out to accept this challenge, and the French were 
thoroughly worsted on the 24th in the battle of Maloyaroslavetz. 

39. The Retreat from Moscow. — Then began the celebrated 
retreat. It has generally been forgotten that the utter want 
of march discipline in the French, and not the climatic condi- 
tions, was responsible for the appalling disasters which ensued. 
Actually the frost came later than usual that year, the 27th of 
October, and the weather was dry and bracing; not till the 8th 
of November did the cold at night become sharp. Even when the 
Beresina was reached on the 26th November, the cold was far from 
severe, for the slow and sluggish stream was not frozen over, as is 
proved by the fact that Eble's pioneers worked in the water all 
through that terrible day. But the French army was already com- 
pletely out of hand, and the degree to which the panic of a crowd 
can master even the strongest instinct of the individual is shown 
by the conduct of the fugitives who crowded over the bridges, 
treading hundreds under foot, whilst all the time the river was 
easily fordable and mounted men rode backwards and forwards 
across it. 

To return to. the actual sequence of events. Kutusov had 
been very slow in exploiting his success of the 24th and indeed 
had begun the pursuit in a false direction; but about the 2nd of 
November, headquarters of the French being at Vyazma, the 
Cossacks became so threatening that the emperor ordered the 
army to march (as in Egypt) in hollow square. This order, 
however, appears only to have been obeyed by the Guards, with 
whom henceforward the emperor marched. 

Kutusov had now overtaken the French, but fortunately for 
them he made no effort to close with them, but hung on their 
flank, molesting them with Cossacks and picking up stragglers. 
Thus the wreck of the Grande Amite, now not more than 
fifty thousand strong, reached Smolensk on the 9th and 
there rested till the 14th, The march was then resumed, the 
Guard leading and Ney commanding the rearguard. Near 
Krasnoi on the 16th the Russian advanced guard tried to head 
the column off. Napoleon halted a whole day to let the army 
close up; and then attacked with his old vigour and succeeded 
in clearing the road, but only at the cost of leaving Ney and the 
rearguard to its fate. By a night march of unexampled daring 
and difficulty Ney succeeded in breaking through the Russian 
cordon, but when he regained touch with the main body at 
Orcha only 800 of his 6000 men were still with him (21st). 

40. The Beresina. — From here Napoleon despatched orders 
to Victor to join him at Borisov on the Beresina. The cold now 
gave way and thaw set in, leaving the country a morass, and 
Information came that Tschitschagov from the south had reached 



Borisov. He now selected Viesselovo as the point of passage and 
at 1 a.m. on the 23rd sent orders to Oudinot to march thither 
and construct bridges. In the execution of these orders Oudinot 
encountered the Russian advanced guard near Borisov and 
drove the latter back in confusion, though not before they had 
destroyed the existing bridge there. This sudden reassumption 
of the offensive threw Tschitschagov into confusion. Thus time 
was gained for Victor also to come up and for Oudinot to con- 
struct the bridges at Studienka near the above-mentioned 
place, but a spot in many respects better suited for the purpose. 
Thither therefore Napoleon sent his pontonniers under General 
Eble, but on their arrival they found that no preparations had 
been made and much time was lost. Meanwhile Victor, in doubt 
as to the real point of passage, had left the road to Studienka 
open to Wittgenstein, who had followed hard on his heels. 

By 4 p.m. on the 26th the bridges were finished and the passage 
began, but not without resistance by the Russians, who were 
gradually closing in. The crossing continued all night, though 
interrupted from time to time by failures of the bridges. All 
day during the 27th stragglers continued to cross, covered by 
such combatants as remained under sufficient discipline to be 
employed. At 8 a.m. on the 28th, however, Tschitschagov and 
Wittgenstein moved forward on both banks of the river to the 
attack, but were held off by the splendid self-sacrifice of the few 
remaining troops under Ney, Oudinot and Victor, until about 
1 p.m. the last body of regular troops passed over the bridges, 
and only a few thousand stragglers remained beyond the river. 

The number of troops engaged by the French that day cannot 
be given exactly. Oudinot's and Victor's men were relatively 
fresh and may have totalled 20,000, whilst Ney can hardly have 
had more than 6000 of all corps fighting under him. How many 
were killed can never be known, but three days later the total 
number of men reported fit for duty had fallen to 8800 only. 

41. Final Operations. — Henceforward the retreat of the army 
became practically a headlong flight, and on the 5th of December, 
having reached Smorgoni and seeing that nothing further could 
be done by him at the front, the emperor handed over the 
command of what remained to Murat, and left for Paris to 
organize a fresh army for the following year. Travelling at 
the fullest speed, he reached the Tuileries on the 18th, after a 
journey of 312 hours. 

After the emperor's departure the cold set in with increased 
severity, the thermometer falling to 23 . On the 8th of December 
Murat reached Vilna, whilst Ney with about 400 men and Wrede 
with 2000 Bavarians still formed the rearguard; but it was quite 
impossible to carry out Napoleon's instructions to go into 
winter quarters about the town, so that the retreat was resumed 
on the 10th and ultimately Konigsberg was attained on the 
19th of December by Murat with 400 Guards and 600 Guard 
cavalry dismounted. 

Meanwhile on the extreme French right Schwarzenberg and 
his Austrians had drifted away towards their own frontier, 
and the Prussian contingent, which under Yorck (see Yorck 
von Wartenburg) formed part of Macdonald's command 
about Riga, had entered into a convention with the Russians 
at Tauroggen (December 30) which deprived the French of their 
last support upon their left. Konigsberg thus became untenable, 
and Murat fell back to Posen, where on the 10th of January 
he handed over his command to Eugene Beauharnais and 
returned to Paris. 

The Russian pursuit practically ceased at the line of the 
Niemen, for their troops also had suffered terrible hardships 
and a period of rest had become an absolute necessity. 

42. The War of Liberation. — The Convention of Tauroggen 
became the starting-point of Prussia's regeneration. As the 
news of the destruction of the Grande Arntfe spread, and the 
appearance of countless stragglers convinced the Prussian people 
of the reality of the disaster, the spirit generated by years of 
French domination burst out. For the moment the king and his 
ministers were placed in a position of the greatest anxiety, for 
they knew the resources of France and the boundless versatility 
of their arch-enemy far too well to imagine that the end of their 






heir 



NAPOLEONIC CAMPAIGNS 



229 



sufferings was yet in sight. To disavow the acts and desires of 
the army and of the secret societies for defence with which all 
north Germany was honeycombed would be to imperil the very 
existence of the monarchy, whilst an attack on the wreck of 
the Grand Army meant the certainty of a terrible retribution 
from the new armies now rapidly forming on the Rhine. 

But the Russians and the soldiers were resolved to continue 
the campaign, and working in collusion they put pressure on 
the not unwilling representatives of the civil power to facilitate 
the supply and equipment of such troops as were still in the field; 
they could not refuse food and shelter to their starving country- 
men or their loyal allies, and thus by degrees the French garrisons 
scattered about the country either found themselves surrounded 
or were compelled to retire to avoid that fate. Thus it happened 
that the viceroy of Italy felt himself compelled to depart from 
the positive injunctions of the emperor to hold on at all costs 
to his advanced position at Posen, where about 14,000 men 
had gradually rallied around him, and to withdraw step by step . 
to Magdeburg, where he met reinforcements and commanded 
the whole course of the lower Elbe. 

43. Napoleon's Preparations. — Meanwhile the emperor in 
Paris had been organizing a fresh army for the reconquest of 
Prussia. Thanks to his having compelled his allies to fight his 
battles for him, he had not as yet drawn very heavily on the 
fighting resources of France, the actual percentage of men taken 
by the conscriptions during the years since 1806 being actually 
lower than that in force in continental armies of to-day. He 
had also created in 1811-1812 a new National Guard, organized 
in " cohorts " to distinguish it from the regular army, and for 
home defence only, and these by a skilful appeal to their patriotism 
and judicious pressure applied through the prefects, became a 
useful reservoir of half-trained men for new battalions of the 
active army. Levies were also made with rigorous severity 
in the states of the Rhine Confederation, and even Italy was 
called on for fresh sacrifices. In this manner by the end of 
March upwards of 200,000 men were moving towards the Elbe, 1 
und in the first fortnight of April they were duly concentrated 
in the angle formed by the Elbe and Saale, threatening on the 
one hand Berlin, on the other Dresden and the east. 

44. Spring Campaign of 18 13. — The allies, aware of the gradual 
strengthening of their enemy's forces but themselves as yet 
unable to put more than 200,000 in the field, had left a small 
corps of observation opposite Magdeburg and along the Elbe 
to give timely notice of an advance towards Berlin; and with 
the bulk of their forces had taken up a position about Dresden, 
whence they had determined to march down the course of the 
Elbe and roll up the French from right to left. Both armies 
were very indifferently supplied with information, as both were 
without any reliable regular cavalry capable of piercing the 
screen of outposts with which each endeavoured to conceal 
his disposition, and Napoleon, operating in a most unfriendly 
country, suffered more in this respect than his adversaries. 

On the 25th of April Napoleon reached Erfurt and assumed 
the chief command. On this day his troops stood in the following 
positions. Eugene, with Lauriston's, Macdonald's and Regnier's 
corps, on the lower Saale, Ney in front of Weimar, holding the 
defile of Kosen; the Guard at Erfurt, Marmont at Gotha, 
Bertrand at Saalfeld, and Oudinot at Coburg, and during the 
next few days the whole were set in motion towards Merseburg 
and Leipzig, in the now stereotyped Napoleonic order, a strong 
advanced guard of all arms leading, the remainder — about two- 
thirds of the whole — following as " masse de manoeuvre," this 
time, owing to the cover afforded by the Elbe on the left, to the 
right rear of the advanced guard. 

Meanwhile the Russians and Prussians had concentrated all 
available men and were moving on an almost parallel line, but 
somewhat to the south of the direction taken by the French. 
On the 1 st of May Napoleon and the advanced guard entered 
Lutzen. Wittgenstein, who now commanded the allies in place 
of Kutusov, hearing of his approach, had decided to attack 

1 Napoleon always gave them out as 300,000, but this number 
was never attained. 



the French advanced guard, which he took to be their whole 
force, on its right flank, and during the morning had drawn 
together the bulk of his forces on his right in the vicinity of Gross- 
Gorschen and Kaya. 

45. Battle of L&tzen. — About 9 a.m. on May 2nd he began an 
attack on the French advance guard in Lutzen, whilst the 
remainder of his army was directed against Napoleon's right 
and rear. Just as the latter were moving off the heads of the 
French main body suddenly appeared, and at 11 a.m. Napoleon, 
then standing near the Gustavus Adolphus monument on the 
field of Lutzen, heard the roar of a heavy cannonade to his right 
rear. He realized the situation in a moment, galloped to the 
new scene of action, and at once grouped his forces for decisive 
action — the gift in which he was supreme. Leaving the leading 
troops to repulse as best they might the furious attack of both 
Russians and Prussians, and caring little whether they lost 
ground, he rapidly organized for his own control a battle-reserve. 
At length when both sides were exhausted by their efforts he 
sent forward nearly a hundred guns which tore asunder by their 
case-shot fire the enemy's line and marched his reserve right 
through the gap. Had he possessed an adequate cavalry force 
the victory would have been decisive. As it was, the allies made 
good their retreat and the French were too exhausted for infantry 
pursuit. 

Perhaps no battle better exemplifies the inherent strength of 
the emperor's strategy, and in none was his grasp of the battlefield 
more brilliantly displayed, for, as he. fully recognized, "These 
Prussians have at last learnt something — they are no longer the 
wooden toys of Frederick the Great," and, on the other hand, 
the relative inferiority of his own men as compared with his 
veterans of Austerlitz called for far more individual effort than 
on any previous day. He was everywhere, encouraging and 
compelling his men — it is a legend in the French army that the 
persuasion even of the imperial boot was used upon some of his 
reluctant conscripts, and in the result his system was fully 
justified, as it triumphed even against a great tactical surprise. 

46. Bautzen. — As soon as possible the army pressed on in 
pursuit, Ney being sent across the Elbe to turn the position of the 
allies at Dresden. This threat forced the latter to evacuate the 
town and retire over the Elbe, after blowing up the stone bridge 
across the river. Napoleon entered the town hard on their heels, 
but the broken bridge caused a delay of four days, there being no 
pontoon trains with the army. Ultimately on the 1 8th of May the 
march was renewed, but the allies had continued their retreat in 
leisurely fashion, picking up reinforcements by the way. Arrived 
at the line of the Spree, they took up and fortified a very formid- 
able position about Bautzen (q.v.). Here, on the 20th, they were 
attacked, and after a two days' battle dislodged by Napoleon; 
but the weakness of the French cavalry conditioned both the 
form of the attack, which was less effective than usual, and the 
results of the victory, which were extremely meagre. 

The allies broke off the action at their own time and retired 
in such good order that the emperor failed to capture a single 
trophy as proof of his victory. The enemy's escape annoyed him 
greatly, the absence of captured guns and prisoners reminded 
him too much of his Russian experiences, and he redoubled his 
demands on his corps commanders for greater vigour in the 
pursuit. This led the latter to push on without due regard to 
tactical precautions, and Bliicher took advantage of their 
carelessness when at Haynau (May 26), with some twenty 
squadrons of Landwehr cavalry, he surprised, rode over and 
almost destroyed Maison's division. The material loss inflicted 
on the French was not very great, but its effect in raising the 
moral of the raw Prussian cavalry and increasing their con- 
fidence in their old commander was enormous. 

Still the allies continued their retreat and the French were 
unable to bring them to action. In view of the doubtful attitude 
of Austria, Napoleon became alarmed at the gradual lengthening 
of his lines of communication and opened negotiations. The 
enemy, having everything to gain and nothing to lose thereby, 
agreed finally to a six weeks' suspension of arms. This was 
perhaps the gravest military error of Napoleon's whole career, 



230 



NAPOLEONIC CAMPAIGNS 



and his excuse for it, " want of adequate cavalry," is the strongest 
testimony as to the value of that arm. 

47. The Autumn Campaign. — As soon as a suspension of arms 
(to 15th of August) had been agreed to, Napoleon hastened to 
withdraw his troops from the dangerous position they occupied 
with reference to the passes leading over the mountains from 
Bohemia, for he entertained no doubt now that Austria was also 
to be considered as an enemy. Finally he decided to group his 
corps round Gorlitz and Bautzen whence they could either meet 
the enemy advancing from Breslau or fall on his flank over the 
mountains if they attempted to force their way into Saxony 
by the valley of the 'Elbe. This latter manoeuvre depended, 
however, on his maintenance of Dresden, and to this end he sent 
the I. Corps up the Elbe to Pirna and Konigstein to cover the 
fortifications of Dresden itself. His instructions on this point 
deserve the closest study, for he foresaw the inevitable attraction 
which a complete entrenched camp would exercise even upon him- 
self, and, therefore, limited his engineers to the construction of a 
strong bridge head on the right bank and a continuous enceinte, 
broken only by gaps for counter attack, around the town itself. 

Then he turned his attention to the plan for the coming 
campaign. Seeing clearly that his want of an efficient cavalry 
precluded all ideas of a resolute offensive in his old style, he 
determined to limit himself to a defence of the line of the Elbe, 
making only dashes of a few days' duration at any target the 
enemy might present. 

Reinforcements had been coming up without ceasing and 
at the beginning of August he calculated that he would have 
300,000 men available about Bautzen and 100,000 along the 
Elbe from Hamburg via Magdeburg to Torgau. With the 
latter he determined to strike the first blow, by a concentric 
advance on Berlin (which he calculated he would reach on 
the 4th or 5th day), the movement being continued thence 
to extricate the French garrisons in Kiistrin, Stettin and 



Danzig. The moral effect, he promised himself, would be 
prodigious, and there was neither room nor food for these 
100,000 elsewhere. 

Towards the close of the armistice he learned the general 
situation of the allies. The crown prince of Sweden (Bernadotte), 
with his Swedes and various Prussian levies, 135,000 in all, lay 
in and around Berlin and Stettin; and knowing his former 
marshal well, Napoleon considered Oudinot a match for him. 
Bliicher with about 95,000 Russians and Prussians was about 
Breslau, and Schwarzenberg, with nearly 180,000 Austrians and 
Russians, lay in Bohemia. In his position at Bautzen he felt 
himself equal to all his enemy's combinations. 

48. Dresden. — The advance towards Berlin began punctually 
with the expiration of the armistice, but with the main army he 
himself waited to see more clearly his adversaries' plans. At 
length becoming impatient he advanced a portion of his army 
towards Bliicher, who fell back to draw him into a trap. Then 
the news reached him that Schwarzenberg was pressing down the 
valley of the Elbe, and, leaving Macdonald to observe Bliicher, 
he hurried back to Bautzen to dispose his troops to cross the 
Bohemian mountains in the general direction of Konigstein, a 
blow which must have had decisive results. But the news from 
Dresden was so alarming that at the last moment he changed his 
mind, and sending Vandamme alone over the mountains, he 
hurried with his whole army to the threatened point. This 
march remains one of the most extraordinary in history, for the 
bulk of his forces moved, mainly in mass and across country, 
90 m. in 72 hours, entering Dresden on the morning of the 27th, 
only a few hours before the attack of the allies commenced. For 
the events which followed see Dresden {battle). 

Dresden was the last great victory of the First Empire. By 
noon on the 27th August the Austrians and Russians were 
completely beaten and in full retreat, the French pressing hard 
behind them, but meanwhile Napoleon himself again succumbed

to one of his unaccountable attacks of apparent intellectual 
paralysis. He seemed unaware of the vital importance of the 
moment, crouched shivering over a bivouac fire, and finally rode 
back to Dresden, leaving no specific orders for the further pursuit. 

49. French Defeats. — The allies, however, continued to retreat, 
but unfortunately Vandamme, with his single corps and un- 
supported, issued out of the mountains on their flank, threw 
himself across their line of retreat near Kulm, and was completely 
overwhelmed by sheer weight of numbers (29th). In spite of 
this misfortune, Napoleon co\ild claim a brilliant success for 
himself, but almost at the same moment news reached him that 
Oudinot at Grossbeeren near Berlin, and Macdonald on the 
Katzbach opposed to Bliicher, had both been severely defeated. 

50. Napoleon's Movements. — During the next two days the 
emperor examined his situation and dictated a series of notes 
which have been a puzzle to every strategical thinker ever since. 
In these he seems suddenly to have cut adrift from every principle 
the truth of which he had himself so brilliantly demonstrated, 
and we find him discussing plans based on hypothesis, not 
knowledge, and on the importance of geographical points without 
reference to the enemy's field army. From these reveries he 
was at length awakened by news which indicated that the con- 
sequences of Macdonald's defeat had been far more serious to 
the moral of that command than he had imagined. He immedi- 
ately rode over to establish order, and his manner and violence 
were so improper that Caulaincourt had the greatest difficulty 
in concealing the scandal. Bliicher, however, hearing of his 
arrival, at once retreated and the emperor followed, thus 
uncovering the passes over the Bohemian mountains, a fact 
of which Schwarzenberg was quick to take advantage. Learning 
of his approach, Napoleon again withdrew to Bautzen. Then 
hearing that the Austrians had counter-marched and were again 
moving towards Dresden, he hastened back there, concentrated 
as many men as could conveniently be handled, and advanced 
beyond Pirna and Konigstein to meet him. But the Austrians 
had no intention of attacking him, for time was now working 
on their side and, leaving his men to starve in the exhausted 
district, the emperor again returned to Dresden, where for the 
rest of the month he remained in an extraordinary state of 
vacillation. On the 4th of October he again drew up a review 
of the situation, in which he apparently contemplated giving 
up his communications with France and wintering in and around 
Dresden, though at the same time he is aware of the distress 
amongst his men for want of food. 

51. Campaign of Leipzig. — In the meanwhile Bliicher, 
Schwarzenberg and Bernadotte were working round his flanks. 
Ney, who had joined Oudinot after Grossbeeren, had been 
defeated at Dennewitz (6th Sept.), the victory, won by Prussian 
troops solely, giving the greatest encouragement to the enemy. 
Suddenly Napoleon's plans are again reviewed and completely 
changed. Calling up St Cyr, whom he had already warned to 
remain at Dresden with his command, he decides to fall back 
towards Erfurt; and go into winter quarters between that place 
and Magdeburg, pointing out that Dresden was of no use to him 
as a base and that if he does have a battle, he had much better 
have St Cyr and his men with him than at Dresden. He then 
on the 7th of October drew up a final plan, in which one again 
recognizes the old commander, and this he immediately proceeded 
to put into execution, for he was now quite aware of the danger 
threatening his line of retreat from both Bliicher and Schwarzen- 
berg and the North Army; yet only a few hours afterwards 
the portion of the order relating to St Cyr and Lobau was 
cancelled and the two were finally left behind at Dresden. From 
the 10th to the 13th Napoleon lay at Diiben, again a prey to 
the most extraordinary irresolution, but on that day he thought 
he saw his opportunity. Bliicher was reported near Wittenberg, 
and Schwarzenberg was moving slowly round to the south of 
Leipzig. The North Army under Bernadotte, unknown to 
Napoleon, lay on Bliicher's left around Halle. The emperor 
decided to throw the bulk of his force on Bliicher, and, having 
routed him, turn south on Schwarzenberg and sever his com- 
munications with Bohemia. His concentration was effected 



with his usual sureness and celerity, but whilst the French moved 
on Wittenberg, Bliicher was marching to his right, indifferent 
to his communications as all Prussia lay behind him. 

This move on the 14th brought him into touch with Bernadotte, 
and now a single march forward of all three armies would have 
absolutely isolated Napoleon from France; but Bernadotte 's 
nerve failed him, for on hearing of Napoleon's threat against 
Wittenberg he decided to retreat northward, and not all the 
persuasions of Bliicher and Gneisenau could move him. Thus 
if the French movement momentarily ended in a blow in the 
air, it was indirectly the cause of their ultimate salvation. 

52. The " Battle of the Nations" — On the 15th Napoleon con- 
centrated his forces to the east of Leipzig, with only a weak 
detachment to the west, and in the evening the allies were prepared 
to attack him. Schwarzenberg, with 180,000 men available at 
once and 60,000 on the following day; Bliicher had about 
60,000, but Bernadotte now could not arrive before the 18th. 

Napoleon prepared to throw the bulk of his force upon Schwar- 
zenberg and massed his troops south-east of the town, whilst 
Schwarzenberg marched concentrically against him down 
the valley of the Elster and Pleisse, the mass of his troops 
on the right bank of the latter and a strong column under 
Giulay on the left working round to join Bliicher on the 
north. The fighting which followed was most obstinate, but the 
Austrians failed to make any impression on the French positions, 
and indeed Giulay felt himself compelled to withdraw to his 
former position. On the other hand, Bliicher carried the 
village of Mockern and came within a mile of the gates of the 
town. During the 17th there was only indecisive skirmishing, 
Schwarzenberg waiting for his reinforcements coming up by the 
Dresden road, Bliicher for Bernadotte to come in on his left, 
and by some extraordinary oversight Giulay was brought closer 
in to the Austrian centre, thus opening for the French their 
line of retreat towards Erfurt, and no imformation of this move- 
ment appears to have been conveyed to Bliicher. The emperor 
when he became aware of the movement, sent the IVth Corps 
to Lindenau to keep the road open. 

On the 1 8th the fighting was resumed and by about noon 
Bernadotte came up and closed the gap to the N.E. of the town 
between Bliicher and the Austrians. At 2 p.m. the Saxons, 
who had remained faithful to Napoleon longer than his other 
German allies, went over to the enemy. All hope of saving the 
battle had now to be given up, but the French covered their 
retreat obstinately and by daybreak next morning one-half 
of the army was already filing out along the road to Erfurt 
which had so fortunately been left for them. 

53. Retreat of the French and Battle of Hanau. — It took Bliicher 
time to extricate his troops from the confusion into which the 
battle had thrown them, and the garrison of Leipzig and the 
troops left on the right bank of the Elster still resisted obstinately 
— hence no direct pursuit could be initiated and the French, 
still upwards of 100,000 strong, marching rapidly, soon gained 
distance enough to be reformed. Bliicher followed by parallel 
and inferior roads on their northern flank, but Schwarzenberg 
knowing that the Bavarians also had forsaken the emperor 
and were marching under Wrede, 50,000 strong, to intercept 
his retreat, followed in a most leisurely fashion. Bliicher did 
not succeed in overtaking the French, but the latter, near 
Hanau, found their way barred by Wrede with 50,000 men and 
over 100 guns in a strong position. 

To this fresh emergency Napoleon and his army responded in 
most brilliant fashion. As at Krasnoi in 181 2, they went straight 
for their enemy and after one of the most brilliant series of 
artillery movements in history, directed by General Drouot, 
they marched right over their enemy, practically destroying his 
whole force. Henceforward their march was unmolested, and 
they reached Mainz on the 5th of November. 

54. The Defensive Campaign. — When the last of the French 
troops had crossed to the western bank of the Rhine, divided 
counsels made their appearance at the headquarters of the allies. 
Every one was weary of the war, and many felt that it would be 
unwise to push Napoleon and the French nation to extremes. 



232 



NAPOLEONIC CAMPAIGNS 



Hence a prolonged halt arose, utilized by the troops in renewing 
their equipment and so forth, but ultimately the Young German 
party, led by Blucher and the principal fighting men of the 
army, triumphed, and on the ist of January 1814 the Silesian 
army (50,000) began its passage of the Rhine at Kaub. They 
were to be supported by Schwarzenberg with 200,000 men, who 
was to advance by Basel and Neu Breisach to the south, and 
Bernadotte with the Northern army, about 120,000, was to move 
in support on the right flank through the Netherlands and 
Laon; this force was not yet ready and did not, in fact, reach the 
latter place till March. 

To meet these forces the emperor could not collect 200,000 men 
in all, of whom upwards of 100,000 were held by Wellington on 
the Spanish frontier, and 20,000 more were required to watch 
the debouches from the Alps. Hence less than 80,000 remained 
available for the east and north-eastern frontier. If, however, 
he was weak in numbers, he was now again operating in a 
friendly country, able to find 
food almost everywhere and 
practically indifferent as to his 
communications. 

On the 25th of January, 
Blucher entered Nancy, and, 
moving rapidly up the valley 
of the Moselle, was in com- 
munication with the Austrian 
advanced guard near La 
Rothiere on the afternoon 
of the 28th. Here his head- 
quarters were surprised and 
he himself nearly captured by 
a sudden rush of French 
troops, and he learnt at the 
same time that the emperor 
in person was at hand. He 
accordingly fell back a few 
miles next morning to a strong 
position covering the exits 
from the Bar-sur-Aube defile. 
There he was joined by the 
Austrian advance guard, and 
together they decided to ac- 
cept battle — indeed they had 
no alternative, as the roads 
in rear were so choked with 

traffic that retreat was out of the question. About noon 
the 2nd of February Napoleon attacked them, but the weather 
was terrible, and the ground so heavy that his favourite 
artillery, the mainstay of his whole system of warfare, was 
useless and in the drifts of snow which at intervals swept 
across the field, the columns lost their direction and many 
were severely handled by the Cossacks. At nightfall the 
fighting ceased and the emperor retired to Lesmont, and thence 
to Troyes, Marmont being left to observe the enemy. 

55. MontmiraiL — Owing to the state of the roads, more 
perhaps to the extraordinary lethargy which always characterized 
Schwarzenberg's headquarters, no pursuit was attempted. 
But on the 4th of February Blucher, chafing at this inaction, 
obtained the permission of his own sovereign to transfer his 
line of operations to the valley of the Marne; Pahlen's corps 
of Cossacks were assigned to him to cover his left and maintain 
communication with the Austrians. 

Believing himself secure behind this screen, he advanced from 
Vitry along the roads leading down the valley of the Marne, 
with his columns widely separated for convenience of subsistence 
and shelter — the latter being almost essential in the terrible 
weather prevailing. Blucher himself on the night of the 7th was at 
Sezanne, on the exposed flank so as to be nearer to his sources 
of intelligence, and the rest of his army were distributed in 
four small corps at or near fipernay, Montmirail and fitoges; 
reinforcements also were on their way to join him and were then 
about Vitry. 



In the night his headquarters were again surprised, and he 
learnt that Napoleon himself with his main body was in full 
march to fall on his scattered detachments. At the same time 
he heard that Pahlen's Cossacks had been withdrawn forty-eight 
hours previously, thus completely exposing his flank. He himself 
retreated towards fitoges endeavouring to rally his scattered 
detachments, but Napoleon was too quick for him and in three 
successive days he defeated Sacken at Montmirail,York at Champ 
Aubert and Blucher and his main body at fitoges, pursuing 
the latter towards Vertus. These disasters compelled the retreat 
of the whole Silesian army, and Napoleon, leaving Mortier and 
Marmont to deal with them, hurried back to Troyes with his 
main body to strike the flank of Schwarzenberg's army, which had 
meanwhile begun its leisurely advance, and again at Mormant on 
the 17th of February, Montereau the 18th and Mery the 21st, he 
inflicted such heavy punishment upon his adversaries that they 
fell back precipitately to Bar-sur-Aube.

56. Laon. — In the meantime Blucher had rallied his scattered 
forces and was driving Marmont and Mortier before him. 
Napoleon, as soon as he had disembarrassed himself of Schwarzen- 
berg, counter-marched his main body and moving again by 
Sezanne, fell upon Bliicher's left and drove him back upon 
Soissons. This place had been held by a French garrison, 
but had capitulated only twenty-four hours beforehand, a fact 
of which Napoleon was naturally unaware. The Silesian army 
was thus able to escape, and marching northwards combined 
with Bernadotte at Laon — this reinforcement bringing the 
forces at Bliicher's disposal up to over 100,000 men. 

On the 7th of March Napoleon fell upon the advance guard of 
this force at Craonne and drove it back upon Laon, where a 
battle took place on the 9th. Napoleon was here defeated, and 
with only 30,000 men at his back he was compelled to renounce 
all ideas of a further offensive, and he retired to rest his troops 
to Reims. Here he remained unmolested for a few days, for 
Blucher was struck down by sickness, and in his absence nothing 
was done. On the 14th of March, however, Schwarzenberg, 
becoming aware of Napoleon's withdrawal to Reims, again began 
his advance and had reached Arcis-sur-Aube when the news of 
Napoleon's approach again induced him to retreat to Bricnne. 

57. The Allies March on Paris. — Thus after six weeks' fighting 
the allies were hardly more advanced than at the beginning. 
Now, however, they began to realize the weakness of their 
opponent, and perhaps actuated by the fear that Wellington 
from Toulouse might, after all, reach Paris first, they determined 



NAPOLEONIC CAMPAIGNS 



233 



to march to Paris (then an open city), and let Napoleon do his 
worst to their communications. Actually this was exactly what 
he was preparing to do. He had determined to move eastward 
to St Dizier, rally what garrisons he could find, and raise the whole 
country against the invaders, and had actually started on the 
execution of this plan when his instructions fell into the enemy's 
hands and his projects were exposed. Regardless of the threat, 
the allies marched straight for the capital. Marmont and 
Mortier with what troops they could rally took up a position on 
Montmartre heights to oppose them, but seeing further resistance 
to be hopeless they gave way on the 31st of March, just as 
Napoleon, with the wreck of the Guards and a mere handful of 
other detachments, was hurrying across the rear of the Austrians 
towards Fontainebleau to join them. 

This was the end of the First Empire. The story of the Water- 
loo Campaign is told under its own heading. 

The Military Character of Napoleon. 

No military career has been examined more often and more 
freely than that of Napoleon. Yet even so the want of complete 
documentary evidence upon which to base conclusions has 
vitiated all but the most recent of the countless monographs 
and histories that have appeared on the subject. Fortunately 
the industry and ability of the military history section of the 
French General Staff have rendered available, by the publica- 
tion of the original orders issued during the course of his 
campaigns, a mass of information which, taken in conjunction 
with his own voluminous correspondence, renders it possible 
to trace the growth of his military genius with a reasonable 
approach to accuracy. Formerly we could only watch the 
evolution of his powers of organization and the purely psychic 
gifts of resolution and command. The actual working of his 
mind towards that strategic and tactical ascendancy that 
rendered his presence on the battlefield, according to the testi- 
mony of his opponents, equal to a reinforcement of 40,000 men, 
was entirely undiscernible. 

The history of his youth reveals no special predilection for 
the military service — the bent of his mind was political far more 
than military, but unlike the politicians of his epoch he con- 
sistently applied scientific and mathematical methods to his 
theories, and desired above all things a knowledge of facts in 
their true relation to one another. His early military education 
was the best and most practical then attainable, primarily 
because he had the good fortune to come under the influence 
of men of exceptional ability — Baron du Keile, Bois Roger and 
others. From them he derived a sound knowledge of artillery 
and fortification, and particularly of mountain warfare, which 
latter was destined to prove of inestimable service to him in 
his first campaigns of 1794-95 and 1796. In these, as well as 
in his most dramatic success of Marengo in 1800, we can discern 
no trace of strategical innovation. He was simply a master of 
the methods of his time. Ceaseless industry, energy and con- 
spicuous personal gallantry were the principal factors of his 
brilliant victories, and even in 1805 at Ulm and Austerlitz 
it was still the excellence of the tactical instrument, the army, 
which the Revolution had bequeathed to him that essentially 
produced the results. 

Meanwhile the mathematical mind, with its craving for accurate 
data on which to found its plans (the most difficult of all to obtain 
under the conditions of warfare), had been searching for ex- 
pedients which might serve him to better purpose, and in 1805 
he had recourse to the cavalry screen in the hope of such results. 
This proved a palliation of his difficulty, but not a solution. 
Cavalry can only observe, it cannot hold. The facts as to the 
position of an opponent accurately observed and correctly re- 
ported at a given moment, afford no reliable guarantee of his 
position 48 hours later, when the orders based on this information 
enter upon execution. This can only be calculated on the ground 
of reasonable probability as to what it may be to the best interest 
of the adversary to attempt. But what may seem to a Napoleon 
the best course is not necessarily the one that suggests itself 
to a mediocre mind, and the greater the gulf which separates 



the two minds the greater the uncertainty which must prevail 
on the side of the abler commander. 

It was in 1806 that an improved solution was first devised 
The general advanced guard of all arms now followed immediately 
behind the cavalry screen and held the enemy in position, 
while the remainder of the army followed at a day's march in 
a " bataillon carree " ready to manoeuvre in any required direc- 
tion. The full reach of this discovery seems as yet scarcely 
to have impressed itself upon the emperor with complete con- 
viction, for in the succeeding campaign in Poland we find that 
he twice departed from this form — at Pultusk and Heilsberg — 
and each time his enemy succeeded in escaping him. At Fried- 
land, however, his success was complete, and henceforth the 
method recurs on practically every battlefield. When it fails it is 
because its inventor himself hesitates to push his own concep- 
tion to its full development (Eckmuhl 1809, Borodino i8r2). Yet 
it would seem that this invention of Napoleon's was intuitive 
rather than reasoned; he never communicated it in its entirety 
to his marshals, and seems to have been only capable of exercising 
it either when in full possession of his health or under the excite- 
ment of action. Thus we find him after the battle of Dresden — 
itself a splendid example of its efficacy — suddenly reverting 
to the terminology of the school in which he had been brought 
up, which he himself had destroyed, only to revive again in the 
next few days and handle his forces strategically with all his 
accustomed brilliancy. 

In 1814 and in i8rs in the presence of the enemy he again 
rises supremely to each occasion, only to lapse in the intervals 
even below the level of his old opponents; and that this was not 
the consequence of temporary depression naturally resulting 
from the accumulated load of his misfortunes, is sufficiently 
shown by the downright puerility of the arguments by which 
he seeks to justify his own successes in the St Helena memoirs, 
which one may search in vain for any indication that Napoleon 
was himself aware of the magnitude of his own discovery. One 
is forced to the conclusion that there existed in Napoleon's 
brain a dual capacity — one the normal and reasoning one, 
developing only the ideas and conceptions of his contemporaries, 
the other intuitive, and capable only of work under abnormal 
pressure. At such moments of crisis it almost excelled human 
comprehension; the mind seems to have gathered to itself 
and summed up the balance of all human passions arranged for 
and against him, and to have calculated with unerring exacti- 
tude the consequences of each decision. 

A partial explanation of this phenomenon may perhaps be 
found in the economy of nervous energy his strategical method 
ensured to him. Marching always ready to fight wherever his 
enemy might stand or move to meet him, his mind was relieved 
from all the hesitations which necessarily arise in men less 
confident in the security of their designs. Hence, when on the 
battlefield the changing course of events left his antagonists 
mentally exhausted, he was able to face them with will power 
neither hound nor broken. But this only explains a portion 
of the mystery that surrounds him, and which will make the 
study of his career the most fascinating to the military student 
of all times. 

Amongst all the great captains of history Cromwell alone 
can be compared to him. Both, in their powers of organization 
and the mastery of the tactical potentialities of the weapons 
of their day, were immeasurably ahead of their times, and both 
also understood to the full the strategic art of binding and 
restraining the independent will power of their opponents, 
an art of which Marlborough and Frederick, Wellington, Lee 
and Moltke do not seem ever even to have grasped the fringe.

Naval Operations 

The French navy came under the direct and exclusive control 
of Napoleon after the 18th Brumaire. At the close of 1799 (see 
French Revolutionary Wars) he had three purposes to serve 
by the help of his fleet: the relief of the French garrison besieged 
by the British forces in Malta; the reinforcement of the army 
he had left in Egypt; and the distraction of Great Britain by 
the threat of invasion of England across the Channel, or of 
Ireland. The deficiencies both in number and in quality of his 
naval resources doomed him to fail in all three. Though he had 
control of what remained of the navies of Holland and Spain, 
as well as of the French, he was outnumbered at every point, 
while the efficiency of the British fleet gave it a mobility which 
doubled its material superiority. All Napoleon's efforts to sup- 
port his troops in Malta and Egypt were necessarily made under 
the hampering obligation to evade the British forces barring the 
road. The inevitable result was that only an occasional blockade- 
runner could succeed in escaping detection and attack. The relief 
thus brought to Malta and Egypt was not sufficient. In February 
1800, the " Genereux " (74), one of the few ships which escaped 
from the Nile, sailed from Toulon with three corvettes, under 
Rear-admiral Perree, to relieve Malta. On the 18th she was 
sighted by the blockading squadron, surrounded and captured. 
Three other survivors of the Nile were at anchor in Malta — the 
" Guillaume Tell " (80), and two frigates, the " Diane " and the 
" Justice." On the 29th of July the " Guillaume Tell " en- 
deavoured to slip out in the night. She was sighted, pursued 
and overpowered, after a singularly gallant resistance. The 
frigates made an attempt to get off on the 24th of August, but 
only the " Justice," a solitary survivor of the squadron which 
fought at the Nile, reached Toulon. Malta, starved out by the 
British fleet,- surrendered on the 5th of September 1800. Very 
similar was the fate of the efforts to reach and reinforce the 
army of Egypt. The British squadrons either stopped the re- 
lieving forces at their point of departure, or baffled, when they 
did not take them, at their landfall. A squadron of seven sail of 
the line, under Admiral Ganteaume, succeeded in slipping out of 
Brest, when a gale had driven the British blockading force off 
the coast. Ganteaume met with some measure of success in 
capturing isolated British men-of-war, one of them being a 74, 
the " Swiftsure." But he failed to give effectual help to the 
Egyptian army. He sailed ovl the 23rd of January 1801, entered 
the Mediterranean and, his squadron being in a bad condition, 
steered for Toulon, which he reached on the 18th of February. 
On the 19th of March he sailed again for Egypt, but was again 
driven back by the same causes on the 5th of April. On the 25th 
he was ordered out once more. Three of his ships had to be sent 



back as unfit to keep the sea. With the other four he reached 
the coast of Egypt, on the 7th of May, only to sight a powerful 
British force, and to be compelled to escape to Toulon, which he 
did not reach till the 22nd of July. The French in Egypt were 
in fact beaten before he reached the coast. At the beginning of 
1801, a British naval force, commanded by Lord Keith, had 
sailed from Gibraltar, escorting an army of 18,000 men under 
General Abercromby. It reached Marmorice Bay, in Asia Minor, 
on the 31st of January, to arrange a co-operation with the Turks, 
and after some delay the army was transported and landed in 
Egypt, on the 7th and 8th of March. Before the end of September 
the French army was reduced to capitulate. In the interval 
another effort to carry help to it was made from Toulon. On 
the 13th of June 1801 Rear-admiral Linois left Toulon with 
three sail of the line, to join a Spanish squadron at Cadiz and go 
on to Egypt. In the straits he was sighted by the British 
squadron under Sir J. Saumarez, and driven to seek the protection 
of the Spanish batteries in Algeciras. On the 6th of July he 
beat off a British attack, capturing the " Hannibal," 74. On 
the 9th a Spanish squadron came to his assistance, and the com- 
bined force steered for Cadiz. During the night of the 12th/ 13th 
of July they were attacked by Sir J. Saumarez. Two Spanish 
three-deckers blew up, and a 74-gun ship was taken. The others 
were blockaded in Cadiz. The invasion scheme was vigorously 
pushed after the "3rd of March 1801. Flat-bottomed boats were 
gradually collected at Boulogne. Two attempts to destroy them 
at anchor, though directed by Nelson himself, were repulsed 
on the 4th and 16th of August. But the invasion was so far 
little more than a threat made for diplomatic purposes. On 
the 1 st of October 1801 an armistice was signed in London, 
and the Peace of Amiens followed, on the 27th of March 1802. 
(For the operations in the Baltic in 1801, see Copenhagen, 
Battle of.) 

The Peace of Amiens proved to be only an uneasy truce, 
and it was succeeded by open war, on the 18th of May 1803. 
From that date till about the middle of August 1805, a space of 
some two years and two months, the war took the form of a most 
determined attempt on the part of Napoleon to carry out an 
invasion of Great Britain, met by the counter measures of the 
British government. The scheme of invasion was based on the 
Boulogne flotilla, a device inherited from the old French ro^al 
government, through the Republic. Its object was to throw 
a great army ashore on the coast between Dover and Hastings. 
The preparations were made on an unprecedented scale. The 
Republic had collected some two hundred and forty vessels. 
Under the direction of Napoleon ten times as many were equipped. 
They were divided into: pratnes, ship-rigged, of 35 metres long 
and 8 wide, carrying 12 guns; chaloupes cannonieres, of 24 metres 
long and 5 wide, carrying 5 guns and brig-rigged; bateaux 
cannoniers, of 19 metres long by 1-56 wide, carrying 2 guns and 
mere boats. All were built to be rowed, were flat-bottomed, and 
of shallow draft so as to be able to navigate close to the shore, and 
to take the ground without hurt. They were built in France 
and the Low Countries, in the coast towns and the rivers — even 
in Paris — and were collected gradually, shore batteries both fixed 
and mobile being largely employed to cover the passage. A 
vast sum of money and the labour of thousands of men were 
employed to clear harbours for them, at and near Boulogne. 
The shallow water on the coast made it impossible for the British 
line-of-battle ships, or even large frigates, to press the attack'on 
them home. Smaller vessels they were able to beat off and so, 
in spite of the activity of the British cruisers and of many sharp 
encounters, the concentration was effected at Boulogne, where an 
army of 130,000 was encamped and was incessantly practised 
in embarking and disembarking. Before the invasion was 
taken in hand as a serious policy, there had been at least a pro- 
fession of a belief that the flotilla could push across the Channel 
during a calm. Experience soon showed that when the needful 
allowance was made for the time required to bring them out 
of harbour (two tides) and for the influence which the Channel 
currents must have upon their speed, it would be extremely rash 
to rely on a calm of sufficient length. Napoleon therefore came

early to the conclusion that he must bring about a concentration 
of his seagoing fleet in the Channel, which would give him a 
temporary command of its waters. 

He had a squadron at Brest, ships at L'Orient and Rochefort, 
some of his vessels had taken refuge at Ferrol on their way back 
from San Domingo when war broke out, one was at Cadiz, and 
he had a squadron at Toulon. All these forces were watched by 
British blockading squadrons. The problem was to bring them 
together before the British fleet could be concentrated to meet 
them. Napoleon's solution grew, as time went on and circum- 
stances changed, in scope and complexity. In July 1804 he 
ordered his admiral commanding at Toulon, Latouche Treville, 
to seize an opportunity when Nelson, who was in command of the 
blockade, was driven off by a northerly gale, to put to sea, with 
10 sail of the line, pick up the French ship in Cadiz, join Ville- 
neuve who was in the Aix roads, and then effect a junction with 
Ganteaume and the 21 sail of the line at Brest. He hoped that 
if the British ships in the North Sea concentrated with the 
squadron in the Channel, he would be able to make use of Dutch 
vessels from the Texel. The death of Latouche Treville, 20th of 
August 1804, supplied an excuse for delay. He was succeeded by 
Villeneuve. Napoleon now modified the simple plan prepared 
for Latouche Treville, and began laying elaborate plans by which 
French vessels were to slip out and sail for distant seas, to draw 
the British fleet after them, and then return to concentrate in 
the Channel. A further modification was introduced by the end 
of 1804. Spain, which was bound by treaty to join Napoleon, 
was allowed to preserve a show of neutrality by paying a monthly 
subvention. The British government, treating this as a hostile 
action — as it was — seized the Spanish treasure ships on their 
way from America, near Cape Santa Maria, on the 5th of October 
1804, and Spain declared war on the 12th of December. New 
plans were now made including the co-operation of the Spanish 
fleet. Amid all the variation in their details, and the apparent 
confusion introduced by Napoleon's habit of suggesting alter- 
natives and discussing probabilities, and in spite of the prepara- 
tions ostensibly made for an expedition to Ireland, which was 
to have sailed from Brest and to have carried 30,000 troops 
commanded by Augereau, the real purpose of Napoleon was 
neither altered nor concealed. He worked to produce doubt 
and confusion in the mind of the British government by threats 
and attacks on its distant possessions, which should lead it to 
scatter its forces. One of these ventures was actually carried 
out, without, however, securing the co-operation, or effecting 
the purpose he had in view. On the nth of January 1805 
Admiral Missiessy left Rochefort with 5 sail of the line, un- 
detected by the British forces on the coast. Missiessy carried out 
a successful voyage of commerce-destroying, and returned safely 
to Rochefort on the 20th of May, from the West Indies. But 
the force sent in pursuit of him was small, and the British 
government was not deceived into weakening its hold on the 
Channel. It was in fact well supplied with information by 
means of the spy service directed by an exiled French royalist, 
the count d'Antraigues, who was established at Dresden as a 
Russian diplomatic agent. Through his correspondents in Paris, 
some of whom had access to Napoleon's papers, the x British 
government was able to learn the emperor's real intentions. 
The blockade of Brest was so strictly maintained that Ganteaume 
was allowed no opportunity to get to sea. Villeneuve, who 
was to have co-operated with Missiessy, did indeed leave Toulon, 
at a moment when Nelson, whose policy it was to encourage 
him to come out by not staying too near the port, was absent, 
on the 1 7th of January 1805. The British admiral, when informed 
that the French were at sea, justified Napoleon's estimate of his 
probable course in such a contingency, by making a useless 
cruise to Egypt. But Villeneuve's ill-appointed ships, manned 
by raw crews, suffered loss of spars in a gale, and he returned to 
Toulon on the 21st. His last start came when he sailed, unseen 
by Nelson, on the 30th of March. Aided by lucky changes of 
wind, he reached Cadiz, was joined by 1 French and 6 Spanish 
ships under Admiral Gravina, which, added to the 11 he had 
with him, gave him a force of 18 sail. He left Cadiz on the night 



of the 9th/ioth of April, and reached Fort de France in Martin- 
ique on the 14th of May. Here he was to have remained till 
joined by Ganteaume from Brest. On the 1st of June he was 
joined by a frigate and two line-of-battle ships sent with orders 
from Rochefort, and was told to remain in the West Indies till 
the 5th of July, and if not joined by Ganteaume to steer for 
Ferrol, pick up the French and Spanish ships in the port, and 
come on to the Channel. Villeneuve learnt on the 8th of June 
that Nelson had reached Barbadoes in pursuit of him on the 4th. 
The British admiral, delayed by contrary winds, had not been 
able to start from the entry to the Straits of Gibraltar till the 
nth of May. An action in the West Indies would have ruined 
the emperor's plan of concentration, and Villeneuve decided to 
sail at once for Ferrol. Nelson, misled by false information, 
ranged the West Indies as far south as the Gulf of Paria, in search 
of his opponent whom he supposed to be engaged in attacks on 
British possessions. By the 13th of June he had learnt the truth, 
and sailed for Gibraltar under the erroneous impression that the 
French admiral would return to Toulon. He sent a brig home 
with despatches; on the 19th of June, in lat. 33 12' N. and 
long. 5 8° W., the French were seen by this vessel heading for 
the Bay of Biscay. Captain Bettesworth who commanded the 
brig hurried home, and the information he brought was at once 
acted on by Lord Barham, the First Lord of the Admiralty, 
who took measures to station a force to intercept Villeneuve 
outside Ferrol. On the 22nd of July, 35 leagues N.W. of Finis- 
terre, Villeneuve was met by the British admiral sent to intercept 
him, Sir Robert Calder. A confused action in a fog ended in the 
capture of 2 Spanish line-of-battle ships. But Sir R. Calder, 
who had only 15 ships to his opponent's 20 and was nervous 
lest he should be overpowered, did not act with energy. He 
retreated to join the blockading fleet off Brest. Villeneuve was 
now able to join the vessels at Ferrol. Nelson, who reached 
Gibraltar on the yery day the action off Ferrol was fought, was 
too far away to interfere with him. But Villeneuve, who was 
deeply impressed by the inefficiency of the ships of his fleet and 
especially of the Spaniards, and who was convinced that an 
overwhelming British force would be united against him in the 
Channel, lost heart, and on the 15th of August sailed south to 
Cadiz. By this movement he ruined the emperor's elaborate 
scheme. Napoleon at once broke up the camp at Boulogne and 
marched to Germany! The further movements of Villeneuve's 
fleet are told under Trafalgar, Battle of. 

With the collapse of the invasion scheme, the naval war 
between Napoleon and Great Britain entered on a new phase. 
It lost at once the unity given to it by the efforts of the emperor 
to effect, and of the British government to baffle the passage of 
the Channel by an army. In place of the movements of great 
fleets to a single end, we have a nine years' story (1805-18 14) 
of cruising for the protection of commerce, of convoy, of colonial 
expeditions to capture French, Dutch or Spanish possessions 
and of combined naval and military operations in which the 
British navy was engaged in carrying troops to various countries, 
and in supporting them on shore. Napoleon continued to build 
line-of-battle ships in numbers from Venice to Hamburg, but 
only in order to force the British government to maintain 
costly and wearing blockades. He never allowed his fleets to go 
to sea to seek battle. The operations of the British fleet were 
therefore divided between the work of patrolling the ocean roads 
and ancillary services to diplomacy, or to the armies serving in 
Italy, Denmark and, after 1808, in Spain. The remaining colonial 
possessions of France, and of Holland, then wholly dependent 
on her, were conquered by degrees, and the ports in which 
privateers were fitted out to cruise against British commerce 
in distant seas were gradually rendered harmless. Though 
privateering was carried on by the French with daring and a 
considerable measure of success, it did not put an appreciable 
check on the growth of British merchant shipping. The function 
of the British navy in the long conflict with Napoleon was of the 
first importance, and its services' were rendered in every sea, 
but their very number, extent and complexity render it impossible 
here to record them in detail.

NAPOLEONITE, also called Corsite because the stone is 
found in the island of Corsica, a variety of diorite which is 
characterized by orbicular structure. The grey matrix of the 
stone has the normal appearance of a diorite, but contains many 
rounded lumps 1 or 2 in. in diameter, which show concentric 
zones of light and dark colours. In these spheroids also a 
distinct and well-marked radial arrangement of the crystals is 
apparent. The centre of the spheroid is usually white or pale 
grey and consists mainly of felspar; the same mineral makes the 
pale zones while the dark ones are rich in hornblende and 
pyroxene. The felspar is a basic variety of plagioclase (anorthite 
or bytownite). Though mostly rounded, the spheroids may 
be elliptical or subangular; sometimes they are in contact with 
one another but usually they are separated by small areas of 
massive diorite. When cut and polished the rock makes a beauti- 
ful and striking ornamental stone. It has been used for making 
paper-weights and other small ornamental articles. 

Spheroidal structure is found in other diorites and in quite a 
number of granites in various^ places, such as Sweden, Russia, 
America, Sardinia, Ireland. It is by no means common, however, 
and usually occurs in only a small part of a granitic or dioritic mass, 
being sometimes restricted to an area of a few square yards. In 
most cases it is found near the centre of the outcrop, though ex- 
ceptionally it has beep found quite close to the margin. It arises 
evidently from intermittent and repeated crystallization of the rock- 
forming minerals in successive stages. Such a process would be 
favoured by complete rest, which would allow of supersatu ration of 
the magma byone of the components. Rapid crystallization would 
follow, producing deposits on any suitable nuclei, and the crystals 
then formed might have a radial disposition on the surfaces on 
which they grew. The magma might then be greatly impoverished 
in this particular substance, and another deposit of a different kind 
would follow, producing^ zone of different colour. The nucleus for 
the spheroidal growth is sometimes an early porphyritic crystal, 
sometimes an enclosure of gneiss, &c, and often does not differ 
essentially in composition from the surrounding rock. When spher- 
oids are in contact their inner zones may be distinct while the outer 
ones are common to both individuals having the outlines of a figure 
of eight. This proves that growth was centrifugal, not centripetal. 

Many varieties of spheroids are described presenting great differ- 
ences in composition and in structure. Some are merely rounded 
balls consisting of the earliest minerals of the rock, such as apatite, 
zircon, biotite and hornblende, and possessing no regular arrange- 
ment. Others have as centres a foreign fragment such as gneiss 
or hornfels, with one or more zones, pale or dark, around this. 
Radial arrangement of the crystals, though often very perfect, is 
by no means universal. The spheroids are sometimes flattened or 
ejjg-shaped, apparently by fluxion movements of the magma at a 
time when they were semi-solid or plastic. As a general rule the 
spheroids are more basic and richer in the ferromagnesian minerals 
than the surrounding rock, though some of the zones are often very 
rich inquartz and felspar. Graphic or perthitic intergrowths between 
the minerals of a zone are frequent. The spheroids vary in width 
up to 1 or 2 ft. m In some cases they contain abnormal constituents 
such as calcite, sillimanite or corundum, (J. S. F.) 

NAQUET, ALFRED JOSEPH (1834- ), French chemist 
and politician, was born at Carpentras (Vaucluse), on the 6th 
of October 1834. He became professor in the faculty of medicine 
in Paris in 1863, and in the same year professor of chemistry 
at Palermo, where he delivered his lectures in Italian. He lost 
his professorship in 1867 with his civic rights, when he was 
condemned to fifteen months' imprisonment for his share in a 
secret society. On a new prosecution in 1869 for his book 
Religion, propriiU, famille he took refuge in Spain. Returning 
to France under the government of Smile Ollivier he took an 
active share in the revolution of the 4th of September 1870, 
and became secretary of the commission of national defence. 
In the National Assembly he sat on the extreme Left, consistently 
opposing the opportunist policy of successive governments. 
Re-elected to the Chamber of Deputies he began the agitation 
against the marriage laws with which his name is especially 



connected. His proposal for the re-establishment of divorce was 
discussed in May 1879, and again in 1881 and 1882, and became 
law two years later. Naquet, although he disapproved in 
principle of a second chamber, secured his election to the senate 
in 1883 to pilot his measure through that body. In 1886 by his 
efforts divorce became legal after three years of definite separa- 
tion on the demand of one of the parties concerned. In 1890 he 
resigned from the senate to re-enter the Chamber of Deputies, 
this time for the 5th arrondissement of Paris, and took his seat 
with the Boulangist deputies. After Boulanger's suicide Ids 
political influence declined, and was further compromised by 
accusations (of which he was legally cleared) in connexion with 
the Panama scandals. 

The thesis written for his doctorate, Application de V analyse 
chimioue & la toxicologic (1859), was followed by many papers on 
chemistry contributed to learned journals, and his Principes de 
chimie fondes sur les theories modernes (1865) reached its 5th edition 
in 1890. Vie is better known by his political works, Socialisme 
coltectiviste et socialisme liberal (1890, Eng. trans., 1891), VHumanite 
et la patrie (1901), Lot du divorce (1903), L'Anarchie et le collectivisme 
(1904), Disarmament ou alliance anglaise (1908). 

NARA, an important water channel in Sind, India, probably 
representing a former bed of the Indus, though now traversing 
the desert far E. of the river. Its total length is 250 m.; and by 
means of cross cuts, weirs and embankments, it has been made 
to irrigate no less than 429 sq. m., with a navigable length of 
425 m. 

NARA, a town of Japan, in the province of Yamato, 25 \ m. 
from Osaka by rail. Pop. 32,000. It lies on the slope of a range 
of picturesque hills, beautifully wooded with cryptomerias, 
evergreen oaks, &c. This was the first permanent capital of 
Japan. Up to the beginning of the 8th century the imperial 
court changed its location at the accession of each sovereign, and 
the court's place of residence naturally became the official 
metropolis. But Nara remained the metropolis during seven 
consecutive reigns (709 to 784), and its seventy-five years of 
favoured existence sufficed for the building and furnishing of 
several imposing shrines and temples, for the laying out of a 
noble park, for the casting of a colossal image of Buddha, and 
for the execution of many other beautiful specimens of applied 
art. Not much is known of the Nara palace in its original form, 
but many of the articles and ornaments used by its inmates 
survive in a celebrated collection which, during nearly twelve 
hundred years, had been preserved in a store-house (Shoso-in) 
near the temple of Todai-ji. This collection cannot be visited 
by strangers more than once a year, and even then only by special 
permission. The vigorous growth of the Buddhist creed through- 
out the Nara epoch was remarkable, and found outward ex- 
pression in many striking architectural and artistic works. The 
best of these, namely, those dating from the first half of the 
8th century, show Indo-Grecian affinities, which gradually grow 
fainter as the end of the epoch approaches. The temple called 
Todai-ji was completed about 750. At present the buildings 
enclose a quadrangle 520 ft. by 620, the south side being mainly 
occupied by the huge, ungainly and no longer perpendicular hall 
containing the Dai Butsu, or colossal statue of Buddha. The 
casting of this wonderful piece of work was accomplished after 
eight failures in 749 by Takusho, an artist from Korea. On two 
occasions the head was melted during the burning of the temple 
(1180 and 1567) and from 1567 to 1697 the statue stood exposed 
to the weather. The height of the figure is 53 ft. On a hill to the 
east of the temple stands a bell-house with a huge bell, cast in 
732, 13^ ft. high, 9 ft. across the mouth and weighing 37 tons. 
The great Buddha is often spoken of as the most remarkable of 
the Nara relics; but restorations have so marred it that it can 
no longer be compared with many smaller examples of con- 
temporaneous and subsequent sculpture. More worthy of close 
attention are two effigies of Brahma and Indra preserved among 
the relics of Kobuku-ji, which, with Kasuga-no-Miya, Ni-gwatsu- 
do and Todai-ji, constitute the chief religious edifices. These 
figures, sculptured in wood, have suffered much from the ravages ' 
of time, but nothing could destroy the grandeur of their propor- 
tions or the majesty and dignity of their pose. Several other

works of scarcely inferior excellence may be seen among the 
relics, and at the shrine of Kasuga is performed a religious dance 
called Kagura, in which the costumes and gestures of the dancers 
are douhtless the same as those of twelve centuries back. Kasuga- 
no-Miya was founded in 767, and its chapels with their rough red- 
painted log-work afford fine examples of primitive Japanese 
architecture. In the temple-park are herds of tame deer; and 
little images of deer and trinkets from deer's horn are the favourite 
charms purchased by the pilgrims. Within the enclosure stands 
a curious old trunk of seven plants entwined, including a camellia, 
cherry and wistaria. Of the great Buddhist temple Kobuku-ji, 
founded in 710, and burnt for the third time in 1717, there 
remains little save two lofty pagodas. A railway now gives 
access to the town, but every effort is made to preserve all the 
ancient features of Nara. A museum has been formed, where 
many antique objects of great interest are displayed, as well as 
works from the hands of comparatively modern artists. Nara 
in the days of its prosperity is said to have had a population of 
a quarter of a million. 

NARAINGANJ, or Narayanganj, a town of India, in the 
Dacca district of eastern Bengal and Assam, situated near the 
junction of two rivers with the Meghna, 10 m. by rail S. of Decca 
city. Pop. ( 1 901) 24,472. As the port of Dacca, having steamer 
communication with both Calcutta and Chittagong, it has 
become the chief entrepot for the jute trade of eastern Bengal. 
There are 73 jute-presses, employing 6000 hands, and the annual 
export of jute exceeds 300,000 tons. It also ranks as the model 
municipality of Bengal. 

NARBONNE, a city of France, capital of an arrondissement 
in the department of Aude, situated in a vine-growing plain 
5 m. from the Mediterranean, on the railway from Toulouse to 
Cette, 37 m. E. of Carcassonne. Pop. (1906) 23,289. The Robine 
canal, a hranch of the Canal du Midi, divides Narbonne into two 
distinct portions, the bourg and the cite. The latter is one of the 
oldest and most interesting of French towns. The former 
cathedral (St Just), which consists only of a choir 130 ft. high 
and transept, was begun in 1272, and the transept was still un- 
finished at the end of the 15th century. The towers (194 ft. high) 
at each extremity of the transept were built about 1480. Some 
additions towards the west were made early in the 18th century. 
An unusual effect is produced by a double row of crenel! ation 
taking the place of balustrades on the roof of the choir chapels 
and connecting the pillars of the flying buttresses. Among the 
sepulchral monuments, which are the chief feature of the interior, 
may be noticed the alabaster tomb of Cardinal Guillaume 
Briconnet, minister of state under Charles VIII. The chapter- 
house, of the 15th century, has a vaulted roof supported on four 
free pillars. The treasury preserves many interesting relics. 
The apse of the cathedral was formerly joined to the fortifications 
of the archiepiscopal palace, and the two buildings are still con- 
nected by a mutUated cloister of the 14th and 15th centuries. 
On the front of the palace are three square towers of unequal 
height. Between the Tour des Telegraphes (1318), crenellated 
and turreted at the corners, and that of St Martial (1374), machj- 
colated and pierced by Gothic openings, a new facade was erected 
in the style of the 13th century after the plans of Viollet-le-Duc. 
This portion of the building now serves as h6tel de ville, and its 
upper stories are occupied by the Narbonne museum of art 
and archaeology, which includes a fine collection of pottery. 
The palace garden also contains many fragments of Roman work 
once built into the now dismantled fortifications; and the 
Musee Lapidaire in the Lamourguier buildings (formerly the 
church of a Benedictine convent) has a collection of Roman 
remains derived from the same source. The church of St Paul, 
though partly Romanesque, is in the main striking, and for the 
south of France a rare example of a building of the first half of 
the 13th century in the Gothic style of the north. It possesses 
some ancient Christian sarcophagi and fine Renaissance wood 
carving. Narbonne has a sub-prefecture, tribunals of first 
instance and of commerce, a board of trade arbitration, a chamber 
of commerce, a communal college for boys and a school of 
commerce and industry. It has a good trade in wine and 



spirituous liquors, and is famous for its honey. The industries 
include cooperage, sulphur-refining, brandy-distilling and the 
manufacture of hricks and tiles and verdigris. 

Long before the Roman invasion of Gaul Narbonne was a flourish- 
ing city, being capital of the Volcae Tectosages. It was there that 
the Romans in 118 B.C. founded their first colony in Gaul, which 
bore the name^ of Narbo Martins; they constructed great works 
to protect the city from inundation and to improve its port, situated 
on a lake now filled up but at that time communicating with the sea. 
Capital of Gallia Narbonensis, the seat of a proconsul and a station 
for the Roman fleet, Narbo Martius became the rival of Massilia. 
But in a.d. 150' it suffered greatly from a conflagration, and the 
division of Gallia Narbonensis into two provinces lessened its im- 
portance as a capital. Alans, Sueyi, Vandals, each held the city 
for a brief space, and at last, in 413, it was occupied by the Visigoths, 
whose capital it afterwards became. In 719, after a siege of two 
years, it was captured by the Saracens, and by them its fortifica- 
tions were restored and extended. Charles Martel, after the battle 
of Poitiers, and Pippin the Short, in 752, were both repulsed from 
its walls; but on a new attempt, after an investment of seven years, 
and by aid of a traitor, the Franks managed again to force their 
way into Narbonne. Charlemagne made the city the capital of the 
duchy of Gothia, and divided it into three lordships — one for the 
bishop, another for a Frankish lord, and the third for the Jews, who, 
occupying their own quarter, possessed schools, synagogues and a 
university famous in the middle ages. The viscounts who succeeded 
the Frankish lord sometimes acknowledged the authority of the 
counts of Toulouse, sometimes that of the counts of Barcelona. 
In the 13th century the crusade against the Albigenses spared the 
city, but the archbishopric was seized by the pope's legate, Arnaud 
Amaury, who took the title of viscount of Narbonne. Simon de 
Montfort, however, deprived him of this dignity, receiving from 
Philip Augustus the duchy of Narbonne along with the county of 
Toulouse. By his expulsion of the Jews Philip the Fair hastened 
the decay of the city; and about the same period the Aude, which 
had formerly been diverted by the Romans, ceased to flow towards 
Narbonne and the harbour, was silted up, tothe further disadvantage 
of the place. In 16^ Henri Marquis de_ Cinq-Mars was arrested at 
Narbonne for conspiring against Richelieu. United to the French 
crownin 1507, Narbonne was enclosed by a new line of walls under 
Francis I., but having ceased to be a garrison town it had the last 
portions of its ramparts demolished in 1870. The^ archbishopric 
was founded about the middle of the 3rd century, its first holder 
being Sergius Paulus; it was suppressed in 1790. 

NARBONNE-LARA, LOUIS MARIE JACQUES AMALRIC, 
comte de (1755-1813), French soldier and diplomatist, was born 
at Colorno, in the duchy of Parma, on the 24th of August 1755. 
He was the son of one of the ladies-in-waiting of Elizabeth, 
duchess of Parma, and his father was either a Spanish nobleman 
or — as has been alleged — Louis XV. himself. He was brought 
up at Versailles with the princesses of France, and was made 
colonel at the age of twenty-five. He became marichal-de- 
camp in 1791, and, through the influence of Madame de Stael, 
was appointed minister of war. But he showed incapacity in 
this post, gave in his resignation, and joined the Army of the 
North. Incurring suspicion as a Feuillant and also by his policy 
at the war office, he emigrated after the 10th of August 1792, 
visited England, Switzerland and Germany, and returned to 
France in 1801. In 1809 he re-entered the army as general of 
division, and was subsequently minister plenipotentiary at 
Munich and aide de camp to Napoleon. In 18 13 he was appointed 
French ambassador at Vienna, where he was engaged in an un- 
equal diplomatic duel with Metternich (q.v.) during the fateful 
months that witnessed the defection of Austria from the cause 
of Napoleon to that of the Allies. He died at Torgau, in Saxony, 
on the 17th of November 1813.

NARBOROUGH, SIR JOHN (d. 1688), English naval com- 
mander, was descended from an old Norfolk family. He received 
his commission in 1664, and in 1666 was promoted lieutenant 
for gallantry in the action with the Dutch fleet off the Downs 
in June of that year. After the peace he was chosen to conduct 
a voyage of exploration in the South Seas. He set sail from 
Deptford on the 26th of November 1669, and entered the Straits 
of Magellan in October of the following year, but returned home 
in June 1671 without accomplishing his original purpose. A 
narrative of the expedition was published at London in 1694 
under the title An Account oj sever al late Voyages and Discoveries 
to the South and North. During the second Dutch War Nar- 
borough was second captain of the lord high-admiral's ship the

" Prince," and conducted himself with such conspicuous valour 
at the battle of Solebay (Southwold Bay) in May 1672 that he 
won special approbation, and shortly afterwards was made rear- 
admiral and knighted. In 1675 he was sent to suppress the 
Tripoline piracies, and by the bold expedient of despatching 
gun-boats into the harbour of Tripoli at midnight and burning 
the ships he induced the dey to agree to a treaty. Shortly after 
his return he undertook a similar expedition against the Algerincs. 
In 1680 he was appointed commissioner of the navy, an office he 
held till his death in 1688. He was buried at Knowlton church, 
Kent, where a monument has been erected to his memory. 
See Charnock, Biog. Nov. i.; Hist. MSS. Comm. 12th Rept. 
NARCISSUS, in Greek mythology, son of the river god 
Cephissus and the nymph Leiriope, distinguished for his beauty. 
The seer Teiresias told his mother that he would have a long 
life, provided he never looked upon his own features. His 
rejection of the love of the nymph Echo (q.v.) drew upon him 
the vengeance of the gods. Having fallen in love with his own 
reflection in the waters of a spring, he pined away (or killed him- 
self) and the flower that bears his name sprang up on the spot 
where he died. According to Pausanias, Narcissus, to console 
himself for the death of a favourite twin-sister, his exact counter- 
part, sat gazing into the spring to recall her features by his own. 
Narcissus, representing the early spring-flower, which for a brief 
space beholds itself mirrored in the water Pnd then fades, is one 
of the many youths whose premature death is recorded in Greek 
mythology (cf. Adonis, Linus, Hyacinthus); the flower itself 
was regarded as a symbol of such death. It was the last flower 
gathered by Persephone before she was carried off by Hades, 
and was sacred to Demeter and Core (the cult name of Perse- 
phone), the great goddesses of the underworld. From its 
associations Wieseler takes Narcissus himself to be a spirit of 
the underworld, of death and rest. It is possible that the story 
may have originated in the superstition (alluded to by Arte- 
midorus, Oneirocritica, ii. 7) that it was an omen of death to 
dream of seeing one's reflection in water.

NARCISSUS, a genus of bulbous plants belonging to the 
family Amaryllidaceae, natives of central Europe and the 
Mediterranean region; one species N. Tazetta, extends through 
Asia to Japan. From these, or rather from some of these, by 

cultivation and hybridization, 
have arisen the very numerous 
modern varieties. The plants 
have long narrow leaves spring- 
ing from the bulb and a central 
scape bearing one or more' 
generally large, white or yellow, 
drooping or inclined flowers, 
which are enveloped, before 
opening in a membranous 
spathe. The flowers are regular, 
with a perianth springing from 
above the ovary, tubular below, 
with spreading segments and a 
central corona; the six stamens 
are inserted within the tube. 
The most interesting feature 
botanically is the " corona " or 
" cup," which springs from the 
Fig. 1. — Flowers of Narcissus base of the flower-segments. 
(Narcissus Tazetta) bursting from This gives the special char- 
the sheathing bract or spathe, 6. acter to the flowerj and the 

members of the genus are classified according to the length 
of this organ as compared with that of the segments. The 
most probable supposition is that the cup is simply an 
excrescence or " enation " from the mouth of the flower-tube, 
and is connected with the fertilization of the flowers by insect 
agency. 




There are five well-marked sections. 

1. The hoop-petticoat narcissi, sometimes separated as the genus 
Corbularia, are not more than from 3 to 6 in. in height, and have 
grassy foliage and yellow or white flowers. These have the coronet 
in the centre of the flower very large in proportion to the other parts, 
and much expanded, like the old hooped petticoats. They are now 
all regarded as varieties or forms of the common hoop-petticoat* 
N. Bulbocodium, which has comparatively large bright yellow 
flowers; N. tenuifolius is smaller and somewhat paler and with 
slender erect leaves ; ^ N. citrinus is pale lemon yellow and larger ; 
while N. monophyttus is white. The small bulbs should be taken up 
in summer and replanted in autumn and early winter, according 
to the state of the season. They bloom about March or April in the 
open air. The soil should be free and open, so that water may pass 
off readily. 

2. A second group is that of the Pseudonarcissi, constituting the 
genus Ajax of some botanists, of which the daffodil, N. Pseudo- 
narcissus is the type. The daffodil (fig. 2)js common in woods and 




Fig. 2. — Daffodil — (Narcissus Pseudonarctssus) — J nat. size. 
1, Flower cut open; 2, pistil; 3, horizontal plan of flower. 

thickets in most partsofthe north of Europe, but is rare in Scotland- 
Its leaves are five or six in number, are about 1 ft. in length and 1 in. 
in breadth, and have a blunt keel and flat edges. The stem is about 
18 in. long and the spathe single-flowered. The flowers are large* 
yellow, scented and a little drooping, with a corolla deeply cleft 
into six lobes and a bell-shaped corona which is crisped at the 
margin ; they appear in March or April. In this species the corona 
is also very large and prominent, but is more elongated and trumpet- 
shaped, while the other members are regarded as subspecies or 
varieties of this. Of this group the most striking one perhaps is 
N, bicolor, which has the perianth almost white and the corona 
deep yellow; it yields a number of varieties, some of the best known 
being Empress, Horsfieldi, Grandee, Ellen Willmott, Victoria, 
Weardale Perfection, &c. N. moschatus, a native of the Pyrenees 
and the Spanish peninsula, is a cream-coloured subspecies of great 
beauty with several forms. N. cyclamineus is a pretty dwarf sub- 
species, native of Portugal, with narrow linear leaves and drooping 
flowers with reflexed lemon-yellow segments and an orange-yellow 
corona N. major is a robust form with leaves ^-f in. broad and bright 
lemon-yellow flowers 2-2 J in. long; maximus is a closely-related but 
still finer form; obvallaris (the Tenby daffodil) is an early form with 



NARCOTICS 



239 



uniformly yellow flowers. N. miner and minimus are miniature 
repetitions of the daffodil. All these grow well in good garden soil, 
and blossom from March onwards, coming in very early in genial 
seasons. 

3. Another group, the mock narcissi or star daffodils, with coronets 
of medium size, includes the fine and numerous varieties of N. 
incomparabilis, one of which, with large, double flowers, is known 
as butter-and-eggs ; N. odorus, known as the campernelle jonquil, 
has two to four uniform bright yellow flowers, and is considered a 
hybrid between N. Jonquilla and N. Pseudonarcissus. A form with 
sweet-scented double flowers is known as Queen Ann's jonquil; 
N. juncifolius, a graceful little plant from Spain, Portugal and south 
France, has one to four small bright yellow flowers on each scape. 
The hardier forms of this set thrive in the open border, but the 
smaller sorts, like Queen Ann's ionquU. are better taken up in 
autumn and replanted in February; they bloom freely about April 
or May. N. triandrus — Ganymeae's Cup — is a pretty little species 
with white flowers about 1 in. long; in several of its varieties the 
flowers are a pale or deeper yellow; they make attractive pot plants. 

4. The polyanthus or bunch narcissi form another well-marked 
group, whose peculiarity of producing many flowers on the stem is 
indicated by the name. In these the corona is small and shallow 
as compared with the perianth. Some of the hardier forms, as 
AT. Tazetta itself, the type of the group, succeed in the open borders 
in light well-drained soil, but the bulbs should be deeply planted, 
not less than 6 or 8 in. below the surface, to escape risk of injury 
from frost. Many varieties of this form of narcissus, such as Grand 
Monarque, Paper white, Soleil d'or, are grown. They admit of 
being forced into early bloom, like the hyacinth and tulip. They 
vary with a white, creamy or yellow perianth, and a yellow, lemon, 
primrose or white cup or coronet; and, being richly fragrant, they 
are general favourites amongst spring flowers. Many tons of these 
flowers are exported from the Scilly Isles to the London markets in 
spring. The " Chinese sacred lily " or "joss flower " is a form of 
N. Tazetta. The jonquil, N. Jonquilla, with yellow flowers, a native 
of south Europe and Algeria, of which there are single and double 
flowered varieties, is also grown in pots for early flowering, but does 
well outside in a warm border. 

5. There remains another little group, the poet's or pheasant's- 
eye narcissi (N. poeticus), in which the perianth is large, spreading 
and conspicuous, and the corona very small and shallow. These 
pheasant s-eye narcissi, of which there are several well-marked 
varieties, as radiiflorus, poetarum, recurvus, &c, blossom in succession 
during April and May, and all do well in the open borders as perma- 
nent hardy bulbs. N. biflorus, the primrose peerless, a two-flowered 
whitish yellow-cupped species, equally hardy and easy of culture, is 
a natural hybrid between N. poeticus and Tazetta. N. gracilis, a 
yellow-flowered species, has also been regarded as a hybrid between 
N. Tazetta and N. juncifolius, and blooms later. 

Of late years some remarkably fine hybrids have been raised 
between the various distinct groups of narcissi, and the prices asked 
for the bulbs in many cases are exceedingly high. One of the most 
distinct groups is that known under the name of " Poetaz " — a 
combination of poeticus and Tazetta. The best forms of poeticus 
ornatus have been crossed with the bunch-flowered Tazettas, and 
have resulted in producing varieties with large trusses of exquisite 
flowers more or less resembling the ornatus parents, and varying in 
colour from the purest white to yellow, the rim of the corona being in 
most cases conspicuously and charmingly coloured with red or 
crimson. This is an excellent group for cutting purposes, but it will 
take a few more years to make the varieties common. 

For an account of the history and culture of the narcissus see 
F. W. Burbidge, The Narcissus (1875); a more recent scientific 
treatment of the genus will be found in J. G. Baker's Handbook of 
AmaryUideae (1888); see also Nicholson, Dictionary of Gardening 
(1886) ; and J. Weathers, Practical Guide to Garden Plants (1901). 

NARCOTICS (Gr. vapKuniKos, making numb), a general term 
for substances having the physiological action, in a healthy 
animal, of producing lethargy or stupor, which may pass into 
a state of profound coma or unconsciousness along with complete 
paralysis, terminating in death. Certain substances of this class 
are used in medicine for the relief of pain, and are then called 
anodynes, whilst another group produce profound sleep, and are 
consequently known as hypnotics. In one sense, anaesthetics, 
such as chloroform and ether, may be held to be narcotics, but, 
as they are usually volatile substances causing unconsciousness 
for a comparatively short time, they are conveniently separated 
from the true narcotics, the effects of which are much more 
lasting. These distinctions are to a great extent artificial, 
as it is evident that a substance capable of producing partial 
insensibility to pain, or sleep, will inevitably in larger doses 
cause profound coma ending in death. Hence we find the same 
substances sometimes classed as anodynes and at other times 
as hypnotics. For example, small doses of opium, or of one or 



other of its preparations, relieve pain, whilst larger doses act 
as hypnotics, causing deep sleep passing into coma. Cannabis 
Indica, belladonna and hyoscyamus, are also anodyne in their 
action. The chief narcotics are mentioned below. 



Opium is the inspissated juice of the Papaver somniferum, co 
lining 7-5 to 10*5% of anhydrous morphine. Besides morphi: 



con- 
taining 7-5 to 10*5 % of anhydrous morphine. Besides morphine 
some of the other alkaloids contained in it are of a narcotic nature, 
notably papaverine, narceine, meconine, cryptopine and narcotine, 
but the principal anodyne and narcotic effects are due to the mor- 
phine alkaloid. Though seasoned opium takers may take 20 to 30 
grs. without noticeable effects, I to 3 grs. produces marked symptoms 
in the western races. Idiosyncrasy is marked in regard to the 
amount of opium a person can safely take. The medicinal dose is 
up to 2 grs., and the smallest dose that has been known to cause 
death in an adult is £ gr. The narcotic properties of Morphine vary 
as to whether it is taken by the stomach or injected under the skin; 
2 jjrs. by the stomach is dangerous, and a safe medicinal dose by the 
skin is \ to \ gr. The smallest dose that has produced death in an 
adult was i gr. given hypodermically. The motor centres of the 
brain and spinal cord are first stimulated by opium and morphine 
and later depressed; death in fatal cases being from paralysis of 
the respiratory centre of the medulla. For the treatment of poisoning 
see under Opium. 

Cannabis indica or Indian Hemp (see Hemp). — The part used in 
medicine is the non-fertilized female spikes of the Cannabis^ sativa. 
The active constituent is the resin containing cannabin with the 
active^ principle cannabinol, the alkaloids cannabinene and tetano- 
canabine. Cannabis indica is sold in the East under various names. 
A confection of the drug made in Arabia is called hashisch. Churrus 
is the resin scraped off the leaves, and the dried leaf is called bang, 
gunga or ganga being the name given to the dried flowering tops sold 
for smoking. The medicinal dose is J to 1 gr. of the extract, 2 to 3 
grs. is a poisonous dose, but there is no recorded fatal case in man. 
In Eastern countries the smoking of Cannabis indica produces a 
form of mania. The effects of smaller doses are intoxication of a 
pleasant character, exaltation, hallucinations and delirium, later 
dilatation of the pupils, drowsiness, sleep and coma. Indian hemp 
is an uncertain anodyne and hypnotic. When large quantities have 
been taken an emetic should be given or the stomach pump used, 
and endeavour to allay excitement until the effects have passed off. 

Belladonna and Atropine. — The leaves of the A tropa Belladonna 
or deadly nightshade of which the active principle is atropine 
principally used as a sulphate. A small dose of belladonna or atro- 
pine causes dryness of the throat and mouth, dilatation of the pupils, 
dimness of vision except for distant objects and often double vision. 
The pulse becomes quick, rising, in an adult, from 80 to 120 or 160 
beats per minute; and there is often a bright red flush over the skin. 
The intellectual powers are at first acute and strong, but they soon 
become confused. There is giddiness, confusion of thought, excite- 
ment, a peculiar talkative wakeful restiveness, in which the person 
shows that his mind is occupied by a train of fancies or is haunted 
by visions and spectres. Often there is violent delirium before sleep 
comes on. The sleep after a large dose deepens into stupor, with 
great muscular prostration or paralysis. During all the time the 
pupils are widely dilated. Death occurs from failure both of the 
heart's action and of respiration. The minimum lethal dose is not 
known, but 80 grs. of the root have caused death ; A to ^ gr. 
hypodermically have caused dangerous symptoms and \ gr. would 
almost certainly be fatal. For the medicinal preparations and 
treatment of poisoning see Belladonna. 

Stramonium. — The part of the plant used is the leaves and seed 
of the Datum Stramonium or thorn apple, the alkaloidal constituent 
being daturine, a variable mixture of hyoscinc and atropine. The 
physiological action is almost identical with belladonna. Poisoning 
is usually due to children eating the seeds; the lethal dose is un- 
known. The symptoms produced are divided into three stages- 
delirium, sleep and deep coma. In case of slight poisoning a rash is 
one of the toxic symptoms. The treatment of poisoning is to give 
emetics, wash out the stomach and give stimulants^ and pilocarpine 
subcutaneously, also to apply warmth and to use artificial respiration 
if necessary. 

Hyoscyamus, the leaves of the Hyoscyamus niger or henbane (tf.v.). 
The active principle is hyoscyamine. " The physiological action is 
almost similar to belladonna, with excitement and cardiac stimu- 
lation and afterwardsdepression and stupor, but the action of hyos- 
cyamus on the heart is more powerful. In large doses it is a strong 
cerebral depressant, and produces dilatation of the pupil ; ^ gr. 
of hyoscamine produces marked effects, sleepiness and dryness of tKe 
mouth; \ gr. by subcutaneous injection has produced fatal results. 
The treatment of hyoscyamus poisoning is similar to that of stra- 
monium. 

Hops (the Humulus Lupulus), containing the active principle 
lupuhne, and Lactucarium, the juice of the Lactuca virosa (lettuce), 
containing an alkaloid lactucine, are very feeble narcotics, causing 
heaviness and sleep if taken in large doses. 

Chloral Hydrate is a pure hypnotic which in larger doses is a 
powerful narcotic, producing prolonged sleep with depression of the 
cardiac and motor centres. It is an intrinsic cardiac poison, the 



240 



NARDI— NARSES 



heart being arrested in diastole, with coincident respiratory failure. 
Chloral hydrate is not uniform in its action, some people manifesting 
great susceptibility to the drug. It is safe in small doses of 10 to 
20 grs. It is difficult to say what is a lethal dose. Cases are recorded 
of recovery after 336 grs. taken with an equal amount of potassium 
bromide and even after a dose of 595 grs., but in susceptible persons 
10 to 15 grs. have produced toxic symptoms and death has occurred 
after doses of from 30 to 45 grs. If seen early, the treatment is an 
emetic, but if the poison should have been already absorbed, stimu- 
lants, hot coffee, strychnine or digitalin hypodermically, with 
perhaps artificial respiration, may be required. 

Alcohol in large quantities is a strong narcotic, producing the 
typical stages of preliminary excitement followed by drowsiness 
and profound coma, during which death may occur. The treatment 
is washing out the stomach to prevent the absorption of the poison 
and the use of strychnine hypodermically. 

NARDI, JACOPO (b. 1476), Florentine historian, occupied 
various positions in the service of the Florentine republic after the 
expulsion of the Medici in 1494, and even on their return in 1512 
he continued in the public service. In 1527 he joined in the 
movement for the expulsion of the family and was instrumental 
in defeating the Medicean troops under Cardinal Passerini, who 
were attacking the Palazzo della Signoria. When the Medici 
again definitely became masters of Florence in 1530, Nardi was 
exiled from the city and his property confiscated. He spent the 
rest of his days in various parts of Italy, chiefly in Venice, and 
wrote a statement of the claims of the Florentine exiles against 
the Medici, addressed to the emperor Charles V. The exact 
date of his death is unknown. His chief work is his Istorie della 
Citld di Firenze, covering the period from 1498 to 1538, in part 
based on Biagio Buonaccorsi's Diario. 

L. Arbib's edition of Nardi's history (Florence, 1842) contains a 
biography of the author, and so does that of Agenore Gelli (Florence, 
1888). 

NARES, SIR GEORGE STRONG (1831- ), English Arctic 
explorer, son of a captain in the navy, was educated at the 
Royal Naval College at New Cross, and entered the navy in 
1846. After being employed for some time on the Australian 
station, in 1852 he became mate of the " Resolute " in the 
Arctic expedition which was sent out in that year. Serving in the 
Crimea upon his return, he was appointed lieutenant in charge 
of the naval cadets on the inauguration of the " Britannia " 
training ship, and was then employed in surveying work on the 
N.E. coast of Australia and in the Mediterranean, attaining the 
rank of captain in 1869. While in command of the " Challenger " 
(1872-1874), in the famous voyage of deep-sea exploration 
round the world, he was ordered home to take command of the 
Arctic expedition which set sail in the spring of 1875 in the ships 
" Alert " and " Discovery." He published a narrative of the 
voyage on his return, and for his services was made K.C.B. 
(1876). Two years later he was sent in command of the " Alert " 
to survey Magellan Strait. From 1879 to 1896 he was attached 
to the Harbour Department of the Board of Trade. He retired 
from active service in 1886, and became a vice-admiral in 
1892. (See Polar Regions.) 

NARGILE or Nargileh, the Persian and Turkish name for a 
" hookah," a tobacco pipe with a long flexible tube for stem 
passing through a vessel containing water, often perfumed. 
This bowl was originally made of a coco-nut (Persian ndrgil), 
whence the name, but now glass, metal or porcelain, are also 
used. 

NARNI (anc. Umbrian Nequinum, Rom. Narnia), a town and 
episcopal see of the province of Perugia, Italy, 65 m. N. of Rome 
by rail. Pop. (1901) 5200 (town), 12,773 (commune). It is 
picturesquely situated on a lofty rock (787 ft. above sea-level), 
480 ft. above the Nera valley, at the point where the river 
traverses a narrow ravine, and commands a fine view. The 
cathedral and the portico of S. Maria della Pensola are buildings 
of the nth century with flat arches; the former has some good 
Renaissance sculptures. There are other interesting 'churches; 
S. Francesco has a good doorway of the 14th century. In the 
town hall is a " Coronation of the Virgin " by D. Ghirlandaio. 
The town also contains some picturesque Gothic houses and 
palaces. Near the station, below the town, are factories of 
india-rubber and calcium carbide. 



The Umbrian Nequinum was taken by the Romans after a long 
sie^e in 299 B.C., and a colony planted there against the Umbrians, 
taking its name from the river. It was among the twelve colonies 
that were punished for refusing help to Rome in 209 B.C. It was 
considered a suitable point to oppose a threatened march of Has- 
drubal on Rome. It stood on the Via Flaminia, the great bridge 
of which over the river lies below the town. The original main road 
ran to Nuceria by Mevania; a branch by Interamna and Spoletium 
joined it at Forum Flaminii. According to some authors, the 
emperor Nerva was born at Narnia. The town is mentioned in the 
history of the Gothic wars. Procopius (B.G. i. 17) describes the 
site of the town, the river and the bridge — the latter as built by 
Augustus, and as having the highest arches that he knew. In the 
middle ages Narni was under the papal power. It was the birthplace 
of the well-known condottiere Erasmo Gattamelata.

1862), and other works by the same author. 

NARRAGANSETT, a township of Washington county, Rhode 
Island, U.S.A. on the W. shore of Narragansett Bay, about 25 m. 
S. of Providence and about 8 m. W.S.W. of Newport. Pop. 
(1890) 1408; (1900) 1523; (1905) 1469; (1910) 1250. Area 
about 15 sq. m. It is connected at Kingston Station (about 
9 m. N.W.) by the Narragansett Pier railway with the shore line 
of the New York, New Haven & Hartford railway; an electric 
line connects with Providence. The southern part of the town- 
ship is a peninsula, lying between the mouth of Narragansett 
Bay and an inlet separating this part of the township from 
South Kingstown. Narragansett Pier, within the township, has 
a fine bathing beach, which extends along the indented coast 
between the village and the mouth of the Pattaquamscutt river; 
the force of the surf is somewhat broken by Point Judith, about 
5 m. S. (also in the township), on which there is a lighthouse. 
On a ridge overlooking the ocean and commanding a fine view is 
the Point Judith Country Club, with golf courses, tennis courts 
and a polo-field, on which is held a horse show at the close of 
each season. Many of the summer visitors at Narragansett Pier 
are from New England, New York and Philadelphia, but there 
is a sufficient number from Baltimore, Washington, Richmond, 
Louisville and other Southern cities to give to its society a 
noticeably Southern tone. Narragansett Pier was so-named 
from the piers that were built here late in the 18th century and 
early in the 19th to provide a port for the Narragansett Country, 
or southern Rhode Island, and it still has a coal wharf, and a 
yacht landing at the Casino. The development of the place as a 
summer resort was begun about the middle of the 19th century 
by the erection of a bathing-house and the conversion of some 
farm houses into boarding houses. The erection of large hotels 
and private residences soon followed, and the completion of the 
railway to the pier in 1876 increased its popularity. The District 
of Narragansett (in the town of South Kingstown) was organized 
in 1888 and in 1901 was incorporated as a separate township. 

The town is named from the Narraganset Indians, a once- 
powerful Algonquian tribe, which occupied much of the shore of 
Narragansett Bay. Under their chief Canonicus (d. 1647) they 
were friendly to the early Rhode Island settlers, and under 
Miantonomo (q.v.) entered into a tripartite treaty with the 
Connecticut colonists and the Mohegans; but after the execu- 
tion of Miantonomo the Narragansets under Miantonomo's son, 
Canonchet or Nanuntenoo, were less friendly. Their loyalty 
to the whites was suspected at the time of King Philip's War, 
and on the 19th of December 1675, at the Great or Cedar Swamp- 
(Narragansett Fort) in the present town of South Kingstown 
(immediately west of the town of Narragansett), they were 
decisively defeated by the whites, under Governor Josiah Winslow 
of the Plymouth Colony. The site of the engagement is marked 
by a granite monument erected in 1906 by the Rhode Island 
Society of Colonial Wars. Canonchet escaped, but on the 2nd of 
August 1676 was captured near Stonington, Connecticut, and on 
the following day was executed. Most of the survivors of the 
tribe were later settled among the Niantic, to whom the name 
Narraganset has been transferred. There are now few survivors 
of pure Indian blood. 

NARSES, Narseh, Narseus, king of Persia, son of Shapur I. 
He rose as pretender to the throne against his grand-nephew 
Bahram III. in a.d. 292, and soon became -sole king. He attacked

the Romans, but after defeating the emperor Galerius near 
Cailinicum on the Euphrates in 296 was completely defeated in 
297, and forced to conclude a peace, by which western Meso- 
potamia and five provinces on the left bank of the upper Tigris 
were ceded to the Romans and their sovereignty over the 
kingdom of Armenia was acknowledged. This peace, concluded 
in 297, lasted for forty years. Narses died in 303 and was 
succeeded by his son Hormizd II. (Ed. M.) 

NARSES (c. 478-573) an important officer of Justinian, in 
the 6th century. He was a eunuch, but we are nowhere distinctly 
informed that he was of servile origin. A native of Persarmenia 
(that portion of Armenia which was allotted to Persia by the 
partition of 384), he may have been prepared and educated by 
his parents for service in an oriental court. If the statement that 
he died at the age of ninety-five be correct, he was born about 
478. He was probably brought young to Constantinople, and 
attained a footing in the officium of the grand chamberlain. He 
rose to be one of the three (spectabiles) " chartularii," a position 
implying some literary attainment, and involving the custody of 
the archives of the household. Hence, probably in middle life, he 
became " praepositus sacri cubiculi," an "illustris," and entitled 
along with the praetorian prefects and the generals to the highest, 
rank at the imperial court. In this capacity, in 530, he received 
into the emperor's obedience another Narses, a fellow-country- 
man, with his two brothers, Aratius and Isaac. These Pers- 
armenian generals, having formerly fought under the standard 
of Persia, now in consequence of the successes of Belisarius trans- 
ferred their allegiance to the emperor Justinian, came to Con- 
stantinople, and received costly gifts from' the great minister. 

In 532 the insurrection known as the Nika broke out in 
Constantinople, when for some hours the throne of Justinian 
seemed doomed to overthrow. It was saved partly by the 
courage of his wife, Theodora, and partly by the timely prodigality 
of Narses, who stole out into the capital, and with large sums 
of money bribed the leaders of the " blue " faction, which was 
aforetime loyal to the emperor, to shout as of old " Justiniane 
Auguste tu vincas." 

The African and Italian wars followed. In the fourth year 
of the latter war (538) the splendid successes of Belisarius 
had awakened both joy and fear in the heart of his master. 
Reinforcements were sent into Italy, and Narses was placed 
at their head. Belisarius understood that Narses came to serve 
under him like any other officer of distinguished but subordinate 
rank, and he received a letter from Justinian which seemed to 
support this conclusion. But the friends of Narses continually 
plied him with suggestions that he, a great officer of the house- 
hold, in the secrets of the emperor, had been sent to Italy, not 
to serve as a subaltern, but to hold independent command and 
win military glory for himself. The truth probably lay between 
the two. Justinian could not deprive his great general of the 
supreme command, yet he wished to have a very powerful 
emissary of the court constantly at his side. He would have 
him watched but not hampered." 

The two generals met (a.d. 538) at Fermo on the Adriatic 
coast. The first interference of Narses with the plans of Belisarius 
was beneficial. John, one of the officers highest in rank under 
Belisarius, had pressed on to Rimini, contrary to the instructions 
of his chief, leaving in his rear the difficult fortress of Osimo 
(Auximum) untaken. His daring march had alarmed the Goths 
for Ravenna, and induced them to raise the siege of Rome; 
but he himself was now shut up in Rimini, and on the point of 
being forced by famine to surrender. Belisarius and his followers 
were prepared to let him pay the penalty of his rashness and 
disobedience. But his friend Narses so insisted on the blow to 
the reputation of the imperial arms which would be produced 
by the surrender of Rimini that he carried the council of war 
with him, and Belisarius had to plan a brilliant march across 
the mountains, in conjunction with a movement by the fleet, 
whereby Rimini was relieved while Osimo was still untaken. 
When Belisarius and John met, the latter ostentatiously thanked 
Narses alone for his preservation. 

His next use of his authority was less fortunate. Milan, 



which was holding out for the Romans, was also hard pressed by 
famine. The two generals who were sent to relieve it loitered 
disgracefully over their march, and, when Belisarius wished to 
despatch further reinforcements, the commanders of these 
new troops refused to stir till Narses gave them orders. Belisarius 
wrote to the eunuch pointing out the necessity of unity of purpose 
in the imperial army. At length, grudgingly, Narses gave his 
consent, and issued the required orders; but it was too late. 
Milan had been compelled by extremity of famine to surrender, 
and with it the whole province of Liguria fell into the hands of 
the enemy. This event forced Justinian to recognize the dangers 
of even a partially divided command, and he recalled Narses 
to Constantinople. 

Twelve years elapsed before Narses returned to Italy. Mean- 
while there had been great vicissitudes of fortune both for the 
Romans and the Goths. Italy, which appeared to have been 
won by the sword of Belisarius, had been lost again by the 
exactions and misgovernment of Alexander. Totila had raised 
up a new army, had more than kept Belisarius at bay in five 
difficult campaigns (544-548) and now held nearly all the country. 
Belisarius, however, in this his second series of campaigns, had 
, never been properly seconded by his master. In the spring of 
552 Narses set sail from Salona on the Dalmatian coast with a 
large and well-appointed army. It was a Roman army only 
in name. Lombards, Heruli, Huns, Gepidae and even Persians 
followed the standard of Narses, men equal in physical strength 
and valour to the Goths, and inspired by the liberal pay which 
they received, and by the hope of plunder. 

The eunuch seems to have led his army round the head of 
the Adriatic Gulf. By skilfully co-operating with his fleet, 
he was able to cross the rivers of Venetia without fighting the 
Gothic general Teias, who intended to dispute their passage. 
Having mustered all his forces at Ravenna, he marched south- 
ward. He refused to be detained before Rimini, being determined 
to meet the Gothic king as soon as possible with his army un- 
diminished. The occupation of the pass of Furlo (Petra Pertusa) 
by the Goths prevented his marching by the Via Flaminia, 
but, taking a short circuit, he rejoined the great road near CaglL 
A little farther on, upon the crest of the Appenines, he was met 
by Totila, who had advanced as far as Tadini, called by Procopius- 
Tagina. Parleys, messages and harangues by each general 
followed. At length the line of battle was formed, and the 
Gothic army, probably greatly inferior in number to the Byzan- 
tine was hopelessly routed (July 552), the king receiving a 
mortal wound as he was hurrying from the battlefield. 

With Totila fell the last hopes of the Gothic kingdom of Italy. 
Teias, who was proclaimed his successor, protracted for a few 
months a desperate resistance in the rocky peninsula of Castella- 
mare, overlooking the bay of Naples. At length want of provisions 
forced him into the plain, and there by the river Sarno, almost 
in sight of Pompeii, was fought (553) a battle which is generally 
named from the overlooking range of Mons Lactarius (Monte 
Lettere). The actual site of the battle, however, is about half 
a mile from the little town of Angri, and its memory is still vaguely 
preserved by the name Pozzo dei Goti (well of the Goths). In 
this battle Teias was killed- He was the last king of the 
Ostrogoths. 

The task of Narses, however, was not yet ended. By the 
invitation of the Goths an army of 75,000 warlike Alamanni 
and Franks, the subjects of King Theudibald, crossed the Alps 
under the command of two Alamannic nobles, the brothers 
Lothair and Buccelin (553). The great strategic talents of 
Narses were shown even more conspicuously in this, than in his 
previous and more brilliant campaigns. Against the small but 
gallant bands of Totila and Teias he had adopted the policy 
of rapid marches and imperative challenges to battle. His 
strategy in dealing with the great host from Gaul was of the 
Fabian kind. He kept them as long as he could north of the 
Apennines, while he completed the reduction of the fortresses 
of Tuscany. At the approach of winter he gathered his troops 
into the chief cities and declined operations in the field, while 
the Alamannic brothers marched through Italy, killing and 



242 



NARSINGHGARH— NARVA 



plundering. When the spring of 554 appeared, Lothaire with 
his part of the army insisted on marching back to Gaul, there to 
deposit in safety the plunder which they had reaped. In an 
unimportant engagement near Pesaro he was worsted by the 
Roman generals, and this hastened his northward march. At 
Ceneda in Venetia he died of a raging fever. Pestilence broke 
out in his army, which was so wasted as to be incapable of 
further operations in Italy. Meanwhile his brother Buccelin, 
whose army was also suffering grievously from disease, partly 
induced by free indulgence in the grapes of Campania, encamped 
at Casilinum, the site of modern Capua. Here, after a time, 
Narses accepted the offered battle (554). The barbarians, whose 
army was in the form of a wedge, pierced the Roman centre. 
But by a most skilful manoeuvre Narses contrived to draw 
his lines into a curve, so that his mounted archers on each flank 
could aim their arrows at the backs of the troops who formed 
the otheY side of the Alamannic wedge. They thus fell in whole 
ranks by the hands of unseen antagonists. Soon the Roman 
centre, which had been belated in its march, arrived upon the 
field and completed the work of destruction. Buccelin and his 
whole army were destroyed, though we need not accept the 
statement of the Greek historian (Agathias ii. 9) that only five 
men out of the barbaric host of 30,000 escaped, and only eighty ' 
out of the Roman 18,000 perished. 

The only other important military operation of Narses which 
is recorded — and that indistinctly — is his defeat of the Herulian 
king Sindbal, who had served under him at Capua, but who 
subsequently revolted, was defeated, taken captive and hanged 
by the eunuch's order (565). In the main the thirteen years 
after the battle of Capua (554-567) were years of peace, and 
during them Narses ruled Italy from Ravenna with the title 
of prefect. 1 He rebuilt Milan and other cities destroyed in the 
Gothic War; and two inscriptions on the Salarian bridge at 
Rome have preserved to modern times the record of repairs 
effected by him in the year 564. 

His administration, however, was not popular. The effect 
of the imperial organization was to wring the last solidus out 
of the emaciated and fever-stricken population of Italy, and the 
belief of his subjects was that no small portion of their contribu- 
tions remained in the eunuch's private coffers. At the close of 
565 Justinian died, and a deputation of Romans waited upon 
his successor Justin II., representing that they found " the 
Greeks " harder taskmasters than the Goths, that Narses the 
eunuch was determined to reduce them all to slavery, and that 
unless he were removed they would transfer their allegiance 
to the barbarians. This deputation led to the recall of Narses 
in 567, accompanied, according to a somewhat late tradition, 
by an insulting message from the empress Sophia, who sent him 
a golden distaff, and bade him, as he was not a man, go and 
spin wool in the apartments of the women. " I will spin her 
such a hank," Narses is represented as saying, " that she shall 
not find the end of it in her lifetime "; and forthwith he sent 
messengers to the Lombards in Pannonia, bearing some of the 
fruits of Italy, and inviting them to enter the land which bore 
such goodly produce. Hence came the invasion of Alboin (568), 
which wrested the greater part of Italy from the empire, and 
changed the destinies of the peninsula. 2 

1 Gibbon's statement that Narses was " the first and most powerful 
of the exarchs " is more correct in substance than in form. The 
title of exarch does not appear to be given to Narses by any con- 
temporary writer. He is always " Praefectus Italiae," " Patncius " 
or ' Dux Italiae," except when he bears the style of his former 
offices in the imperial household. " Ex-Praepositus [Cubiculi]" or 
41 Chartularius." 

* This celebrated story seems to be unknown to strictly con- 
temporary authors. We find no hint of it in Agathias (who wrote 
between 566 and 582), in Marius (532-596), or in Gregory of Tours 
" (54 c >-594)- The possibly contemporary Liber Pontificalis and Isidore 
of Seville (560-636) hint at the invitation to the Lombards. Frede- 
garius (so-called), who probably wrote in the middle of the 7th 
century, and Paul the Deacon, towards the close of the 8th, supply 
the saga-like details, which become more minute the farther the 
narrators are from the action. On the whole, the transaction, 
though it is too well vouched for to allow us to dismiss it as entirely 
fabulous, cannot take its place among the undoubted facts of history. 



Narses, who had retired to Naples, was persuaded by the pope 
(John III.) to return to Rome. He died there about 573, and 
his body, enclosed in a leaden coffin, was carried to Constantinople 
and buried there. Several years after his death the secret of 
the hiding-place of his vast stores of wealth is said to have 
been revealed by an old man to the emperor Tiberius II., for 
whose charities to the poor and the captives they furnished an 
opportune supply. 

Narses was short in stature and lean in figure. His freehanded- 
ness and affability made him very popular with his soldiers. Eva- 
grius tells us that he was veryVeligious, and paid especial reverence 
to the Virgin, never engaging in battle till he conceived that she 
had given him the signal. Our best authorities for his life are his 
contemporaries Procopius and Agathias. See Gibbon, Decline and 
Fall, vols. iv. and v., edited by J. B. Bury (1898). (T. H.) 

NARSINGHGARH, a native state of Central India, in the 
Bhopal agency. Area, 741 sq. m.; pop. (1901) 92,093; esti- 
mated revenue, £33,000; tribute to Holkar, £4000. The chief, 
whose title is raja, is a Rajput of the Omat clan. The state was 
founded about 1681 by a minister of Rajgarh, who compelled 
the ruler of that state to transfer to him half his territory. 
The town of Narsinghgarh had a population in 1901 of 8778. 

NARSINGHPUR, a town and district of British India, in the 
*&&£udda division of the Central Provinces. The town is on the 
river Singri, and has a railway station 52 m. E. of Jubbulpore; 
pop. (1901) 11,233. The district has an area of 1976 sq. m. 
It forms a portion of the upper part of the Nerbudda valley. 
The first of those wide alluvial basins which, alternating with 
rocky gorges, give so varied a character to the river's course, 
opens out just below the famous marble rocks in Jubbulpore, and 
extends westward for 225 m., including the whole of Narsinghpur, 
together with the greater part of Hoshangabad. The Satpura 
hills to the south are here a generally regular range, nowhere 
more than 500 ft. above the plain, and running almost parallel 
to the river, at a distance of 15 or 20 m. In the intervening 
valley, the rich level of black wheat land is seldom broken, 
except by occasional mounds of gravel or nodular limestone, 
which afford serviceable village sites. Along the foot of the 
boundary hills the alluvium gives way to belts of red gravelly 
soil, rice and sugar-cane take the place of wheat, and forest trees 
that of mango groves. The population in 1901 was 315,518, 
showing a decrease of 14-5% in the decade, due to famine. 
The principal crops are wheat, millets, rice, pulses, oil-seeds 
and cotton. There are manufactures of cotton, silk, brass and 
iron-ware. At Mohpani are coal-mines. The Great Indian 
Peninsula railway runs through the district, with a branch to 
Mohpani. 

See Narsinghpur District Gazetteer (Bombay, 1906). 

NARTHEX (Gr. vap6i}£, the name of the plant giant-fennel, 
in Lat. ferula) , the name applied in architecture, probably from 
a supposed resemblance in shape to the reed-like plant, to the long 
arcaded porch forming the entrance into a Christian church, 
to which the catechumens and penitents were admitted. Some- 
times there was a second narthex or vestibule within the church, 
when the outer one was known as the exonarthex. In Byzantine 
churches this inner narthex formed part of the main structure 
of the church, being divided from it by a screen of columns. 
A narthex is found in some German churches, where, however, 
it had no ritual meaning but was introduced as a western 
transept to give more importance to the west end. One of the 
finest examples to be found in England is that of Ely cathedral, 
where -its northern portion, however, was apparently never 
completed. 

NARVA (Rugodiv of Russian annals, also Ivangorod), a seaport 
and fortress of Russia, in the government of St Petersburg, 
100 m. by rail W.S.W. of the city of St Petersburg. Pop. 
(1897) 16,577. It stands on the Narova river, which flows 
from Lake Peipus or Chudskoye, and enters the Gulf of Finland 
in Narva Bay, 8 m. below this town. The town was founded in 
1223 by Danes, and changed hands between the Teutonic 
knights, Danes, Swedes and Russians until it was taken by 
Peter the Great in 1704, after the Russians had suffered here a 
teriihle defeat at the hands of Charles XII. of Sweden four years

before. Its fortress, built on the right bank of the river, and 
known as Ivangorod, has lost its importance, and was abandoned 
in 1864. The cathedral and the town hall (1683) contain 
interesting antiquities. There are here an arsenal, a small 
museum and a school of navigation. Several manufactories 
utilize the waterfalls of the Narova, e.g. cotton-mills, woollen 
cloth mills, flax and jute mills, saw-mills and steam flour mills. 
The total trade falls short of half a million sterling annually. A 
watering-place has grown up at Ust-Narova, or Hungerburg, at 
the mouth of the Narova. 

NARVACAN, a town of the province of Ilocos Sur, Luzon, 
Philippine Islands, near the coast and on the main road 13 m. 
S.S.E. of Vigan, the capital. Pop. (1903) 19,575. It lies in a 
level valley surrounded by mountains, and has a cool and healthy 
climate. The soil, both in the valley and on the neighbouring 
mountain-sides, is very fertile, and produces rice, vegetables, 
Indian corn, indigo, cotton, tobacco, maguey and sugar-cane. 
Cotton fabrics are woven by the women and sold to the mountain 
tribes. The language of the town is Ilocano. 

NARVAEZ, PANFILO DE (c. 1480-1528), Spanish adventurer, 
was an hidalgo of Castile, born at Valladolid about 1480. He 
was one of the subordinates of Velazquez in the reduction of 
Cuba, and, after having held various posts under his governor- 
ship, was put at the head of the force sent to the Aztec coast to 
compel Cortes to renounce his command; he was surprised and 
defeated, however, by his abler and more active compatriot at 
Cempoalla, and made prisoner with the loss of an eye (1520). 
After his return to Spain he obtained from Charles V. a grant of 
Florida as far as the River of Palms; sailing in 1527 with five 
ships and a force of about 600 men, he landed, probably near 
Pensacola Bay, in April 1528, and, striking inland with some 300 
of his followers, reached " Apalache " on June 25. The prospects 
of fabulous wealth which had sustained them in their difficult 
and perilous journey having proved illusory a return to the 
coast was determined, and the Bahia de los Caballos, at or near 
St Mark's, was reached in the following month. Having built 
rude boats, the much-reduced company sailed hence for Mexico 
on September 22, but the vessel which carried Narvaez was 
driven to sea in a storm and perished. His lieutenant, Cabeza 
de Vaca, with three others who ultimately reached land, made his 
way across Texas to the Gulf of California. (See Florida.)

1890); and the Naufragio of Alvaro Nunez Cabeza de Vaca in the

NARVAEZ, RAMON MARIA (1800-1868), Spanish soldier and 
statesman, was born at Loja, Granada, on the 4th of August 1800, 
entered the army at an early age, and saw active service under 
Mina in Catalonia in 1822. He was in his sympathies a Con- 
servative, and could not go all lengths with the Radical opposi- 
tion to Ferdinand VII., whom he served after his restoration. 
When the king died, Narvaez became one of the Conservative 
supporters of Isabel II. He achieved great popularity by his 
victory over Gomez, the Carlist general, near Arcos, in November 
1836, and after clearing La Mancha of brigands by a vigorous 
policy of suppression in 1838 he was appointed captain-general 
of Old Castile, and commander-in-chief of the army of reserve. 
In 1840, for the part he had taken at Seville in the insurrection 
against Espartero and the Progresista party, he was compelled 
to take refuge in France, where, in conjunction with Maria 
Cristina, he planned the expedition of 1843 which led to the 
overthrow of his adversary. In 1844 he became prime minister, 
and was created field-marshal and duke of Valencia, but his 
policy was too reactionary to be tolerated long, and he was 
compelled to quit office in February 1846. He now held the post 
of ambassador at Paris, until again called to preside over the 
council of ministers in 1847; but misunderstandings with 
Maria Cristina led to his resignation in the following year. 
His ministry succeeded that of O'Donnell for a short time in 
1856-1857, and he again returned to power for a few months 
in 1864-1865. He once more replaced O'Donnell in July 1866, 
and was still in office when he died at Madrid on the 23rd of 
April 1868. 



Some very curious notices of Narvaez may be found in the letters 
of Prosper Merimee to Panizzi (i88i) ; For his general political 
career see Hermann Baumgarten, Geschichte Spaniens v. Ausbruch d. 
franzos. RevoL bis auf unsere Tage (1865-1 871); and the Historia 
Contemporanea of Antonio Pirala (187 1-1879). 

NARVIK or Victoriahavn, a seaport on the Ofoten Fjord of 
the north-west coast of Norway, in Nordland ami (county), 
68° 30' N. It is wholly modern, developed by the construction 
and completion (1903) of the Ofoten railway, the most northerly 
in the world. There are extensive quays, from which is shipped 
the iron ore from the rich districts traversed by the line. Narvik 
is 167 m. N.W. of Gellivara, and 982 N. by W. of Stockholm by 
the railway. In summer express trains cover the whole distance 
in two days. Narvik is a convenient point from which to visit 
the beautiful Lofoten Islands. 

NARWHAL, the Scandinavian name of a cetacean (Monodon 
monoceros), characterized by the presence in the male of a long 
horn-like tusk. In the adult of both sexes there are only two 
teeth, both in the upper jaw, which lie horizontally side by side, 
and in the female remain throughout life concealed in cavities 
of the bone. In the male the right tooth usually remains similarly 
concealed, but the left is immensely developed, attaining a length 
equal to more than half that of the entire animal. In a narwhal 
12 ft. long, from snout to end of tail, the exserted portion of the 
tusk may measure 6 or 7 and occasionally 8 ft. in length. It 
projects horizontally forwards from the head in the form of a 
cylindrical or slightly tapering, pointed tusk, composed of ivory, 
with a central cavity reaching almost to the apex, without 
enamel, and with the surface marked by spiral grooves and 
ridges, running in a sinistral direction. Occasionally both left 
and right tusks are developed, in which case the direction of the 
grooves is the same in both. No instance has ever been met 
with of the complete development of the right tusk associated 
with a rudimentary condition of the left. In young animals 
several small additional teeth are present, but these usually 
disappear soon after birth. 

The head is rather short and rounded; the fore limbs or 
paddles are small and broad compared with those of most 
dolphins; and (as in the beluga) a dorsal fin, found in nearly all 
other members of the group, is wanting. The general colour of 
the surface is dark grey ahove and white below, variously 
marbled and spotted with shades of grey. 

The narwhal is an Arctic whale, frequenting the icy circum- 
polar seas, and rarely seen south of 65 N. lat. Four instances 
have, however, been recorded of its occurrence on the British 
coasts, one on the coast of Norfolk in 1588, one in the Firth of 
Forth in 1648, one near Boston in Lincolnshire in 1800, while 
a fourth entangled itself among rocks in the Sound of Weesdale, 
Shetland, in September 1808. Like most cetaceans it is gregari- 
ous and usually met with in " schools " or* herds of fifteen or 
twenty individuals. Its food appears to be cuttlefishes, small 
fishes and crustaceans. The purpose served by the tusk — or 
" horn " — is not known; and little is known of the habits of 
narwhals. Scoresby describes them as " extremely playful, 
frequently elevating their horns and crossing them with each 
other as in fencing." They have never been known to charge and 
pierce the bottom of ships with their weapons, as the swordfish 
does. The name " sea-unicorn " is sometimes applied to the 
narwhal. The ivory of which the tusk is composed is of very 
good quality, but owing to the central cavity, only fitted for the 
manufacture of objects of small size. The entire tusks are 
sometimes used for decorative purposes, and are of considerable, 
though fluctuating, value. (See Cetacea.) (W. H. F.) 

NASCIMENTO, FRANCISCO MANOEL DE (1734-1819), 
Portuguese poet, better known by the literary name of Filinto 
Elysio, bestowed on him by the Marqueza de Alorna, was the 
reputed son of a Lisbon boat-owner. In his early years he 
acquired a love of national customs and traditions which his 
humanist education never obliterated, while, in addition, he 
learnt to know the whole range of popular literature (litter atur a 
de cordet) — songs, comedies, knightly stories and fairy tales, 
which were then printed in loose sheets (folhas volantes) and sold 
by the blind in the streets of the capital. These circumstances

explain the richness of his vocabulary, and joined to an ardent 
patriotism they fitted him to become the herald of the literary 
revival known as Romanticism, which was inaugurated by his 
distinguished follower Almeida Garrett. Nascimento began to 
write verses at the age of fourteen. m He was ordained a priest in 
1754, and shortly afterwards became treasurer of the Chagas 
church in Lisbon. He led a retired life, and devoted his time 
to the study of the Latin classics, especially Horace, and to the 
society of literary friends, among whom were numbered some 
cultivated foreign merchants. These men nourished the common 
ambition to restore Camoens, then half forgotten, to his rightful 
place as the king of the Portuguese Parnassus, and they pro- 
claimed the cult of the Quinhentistas, regarding them as the best 
poetical models, while in philosophy they accepted the teaching 
of the French Encyclopaedists. 

Nascimento's first publication was a version of one of 
Metastases operas, and his early work consisted mainly of 
translations. Though of small volume and merit, it sufficed 
to arouse the jealousy of his brother bards. At this time the 
Arcadia was working to restore good taste and purify the 
language of gallicisms, but the members of this society forgot 
the traditions of their own land in their desire to imitate the 
classics. Nascimento and other writers who did not belong 
to the Arcadia, formed themselves into a rival group, which met 
at the Ribeira das Naos, and the two bodies attacked one 
another in rhyme without restraint, until the " war of the poets," 
as it was called, ended with the collapse of the Arcadia. Nasci- 
mento now conceived a strong but platonic affection for D. 
Maria de Almeida, afterwards Condessa da Ribeira, sister of 
the famous poetess the Marqueza de Alorna. This lady sang 
the chansonnettes he wrote for her, and their poetical intercourse 
drew from him some lyrics of profound emotion. This was 
the happiest epoch of his life, but it did not last long. The 
accession of D. Maria I. inaugurated an era of reaction against 
the spirit and reforms of Pombal, and religious- succeeded to 
political intolerance. In June 1778 Nascimento was denounced 
to the Inquisition on the charge of having given vent to heterodox 
opinions and read " the works of modern philosophers who 
follow natural reason." The tribunal held a secret inquiry, and 
without giving him an opportunity of defence issued an order 
for his arrest, which was to take place early in the morning of 
the 14th of July. He had received a warning, and succeeded 
in escaping to the house of a French merchant, Verdier, where 
he lay hid for eleven days, at the end of which his friend the 
Marquez de Marialva put him on board a French ship which 
carried him to Havre. Nascimento took up his residence in 
Paris, and his first years there passed pleasantly enough. Soon, 
however, his circumstances changed for the worse. He received 
the news of the confiscation of his property by the Inquisition; 
and though he strove to support himself by teaching and writing 
he could hardly make both ends meet. In 1792 his admirer 
Antonio de Araujo, afterwards Conde de Barca, then Portuguese 
minister to Holland, offered the poet the hospitality of his house 
at the Hague, but neither the country, the people, nor the 
language were congenial, and when his host went to Paris on a 
diplomatic mission in 1797 Nascimento accompanied him, and 
spent the rest of his life in and near the French capital. He 
retained to the end an intense love of country, which made him 
wish to die in Portugal, and in 1796 a royal decree permitting 
his return there and ordering the restoration of his goods was 
issued, but delays occurred in its execution, and the flight of 
the court to the Brazils as a result of the French invasion finally 
dashed his hopes. Before this the Conde de Barca had obtained 
him a commission from the Portuguese government to translate 
the De Rebus Emanuelis of Osorio; the assistance of some 
-fellow-countrymen in Paris carried him through his last years, 
which were cheered by the friendship of his biographer and 
translator Alexandre Sane and of the Lusophil Ferdinand 
Denis. Lamartine addressed an ode to him; he enjoyed the 
esteem of Chateaubriand; and his admirers at home, who 
imitated him extensively, were called after him Os Filintistas. 
Exile and suffering had enlarged his ideas and given him a sense 



of reality, making his best poems those he wrote between the 
ages of seventy and eighty-five, and when he passed away, it 
was recognized that Portugal had lost her foremost contempo- 
rary poet. 

Garrett declared that Nascimento was worth an academy in 
himself by his knowledge of the language, adding that no poet 
since Camoens had rendered it such valuable services; but his 
truest title to fame is that he brought literature once more into 
touch with the life of the nation. By his life, as by his works, 
Nascimento links the 18th and 19th centuries, the Neo- Classical 
period with Romanticism. Wieland's Oberon and Chateau- 
briand's Martyrs opened a new world to him, and his conios 
or scenes of Portuguese life have a real romantic flavour; they 
are the most natural of his compositions, though his noble 
patriotic odes — those " To Neptune speaking to the Portuguese " 
and " To the liberty and independence of the United States " — 
are the most quoted and admired. On leaving Portugal, he 
abandoned the use of rhyme as cramping freedom of thought 
and expression; nevertheless bis highly polished verses are 
generally robust to hardness and overdone with archaisms. 
His translations from Latin, French and Italian, are accurate 
though harsh, and his renderings of Racine and the Fables of 
Lafontaine entirely lack the simplicity and grace of the originals. 
But Nascimento's blank verse translation of the Martyrs is in 
many ways superior to Chateaubriand's prose.

NASEBY, a village of Northamptonshire, England, 7 m. 
S.S.W. of Market Harborough, famous as the scene of the battle of 
June 14, 1645, which decided the issue of the first Civil War (see 
Great Rebellion). The army of King Charles I. was less tban 
10,000 strong, while the " New Model " army of the parliament, 
commanded by Sir Thomas Fairfax, numbered some 13,000, 
yet it was not without considerable hopes of victory that the 
Royalists drew up for battle, for although Lieutenant- General 
Cromwell had made the New Model cavalry formidable indeed, 
the Royalist foot had become professionalized in several years 
of war, whereas the Parliamentarian foot was newly organized, 
and in part at least but half-trained. Fairfax and Cromwell, 
however, were still more confident, and with better reason. 
The battlefield lies between Naseby and Sibbertoft (3 m. N. 
of Naseby) and is an undulating ridge which, near the centre 
of England, forms the " divide " between the Avon and the 
Welland rivers. Across this ridge the two armies were drawn 
up, the New Model facing north and the king's army south, 
the horse on the flanks and the foot in the centre in- each army. 

At the first shock the Royal foot asserted its superiority over 
the opposing infantry, four out of five regiments in the first 
line were broken, and Skippon, the major-general of the foot, 
was wounded. But Fairfax's regiment held its ground, until 
the second line of infantry advanced and re-established the front. 
Meantime the Royalist right wing of horse, led by Prince Rupert, 
had completely routed the horse of Colonel Ireton which opposed 
them. But the victors as usual indulged in a disorderly pursuit, 
and attempted to overpower the baggage guard of the enemy 
near Naseby village. Their incoherent attack was repulsed, 
and when Rupert, gathering as many of his men as he could, 
returned to the battlefield, the decisive stroke had been delivered 
by Cromwell and the right wing of Parliamentary horse. In 
front of him, in somewhat broken ground, was Sir Marmaduke 
Langdale's cavalry, which the lieutenant-general with his own 
well- trained regiments scattered after a short, fierce encounter. 
Cromwell's " godly " troopers did not scatter in pursuit. A 
few squadrons were ordered to keep the fugitives on the run, and 
with the rest, and such of Ireton's broken troops as he could 
gather, Cromwell attacked the Royalist centre in rear while 
Fairfax and his foot pressed it in front. Gradually the Royalist 
infantry, inferior in numbers, was disintegrated into small groups, 
which surrendered one after the other. But one brigade, called

the " Bluecoats," held out to the last, and was finally broken 
by a combined charge of Fairfax's regiment of foot, led by 
Cromwell, and the general's personal escort, led by Fairfax 
himself, who captured a colour with his'own hand. The remnant 
of the king's army, re-formed by Rupert, stood inactive and 
irresolute while its infantry was being destroyed and then fled. 
The spoils included 100 standards and colours and the king's 
private papers. But more important than trophies was the 
practical annihilation of the last field army of which the king 
disposed. Half the Royalists were captured, and about 1000 
fell, in the battle and the pursuit which followed it. In addition 
all the artillery and .the muskets (to the number of 8000) and 
ammunition without which the king could scarcely create a new 
army, fell into the hands of the victors. 

NASH, RICHARD (1674-1762), English dandy, better known 
as " Beau Nash," was born at Swansea on the 18th of October 
1674. He was descended from an old family of good position, 
but his father from straitened means had become partner in a 
glass business. Young Nash was educated at Carmarthen 
grammar school and at Jesus College, Oxford. He obtained a 
commission in the army, which, however, he soon exchanged for 
the study of law at the Temple. Here among " wits and men 
of pleasure " he came to be accepted as an authority in regard 
to dress, manners and style. When the members of the Inns of 
Court entertained William III. after his accession, Nash was 
chosen to conduct the pageant at the Middle Temple. This duty 
he performed so much to the satisfaction of the king that he 
was offered knighthood, but he declined the honour, unless 
accompanied by a pension. As the king did not take the hint, 
Nash found it necessary to turn gamester. The pursuit of his 
calling led him in 1705 to Bath, where he had the good fortune 
almost immediately to succeed Captain Webster as master of the 
ceremonies. His qualifications for such a position were unique, 
and under his authority reforms were introduced which rapidly 
secured to Bath a leading position as a fashionable watering-place. 
He drew up a new code of rules for the regulation of balls and 
assemblies, abolished the habit of wearing swords in places 
of public amusement and brought duelling into disrepute, 
induced gentlemen to adopt shoes and stockings in parades and 
assemblies instead of boots, reduced refractory chairmen to 
submission and civility, and introduced a tariff for lodgings. 
Through his exertions a handsome assembly-room was also 
erected, and the streets and public buildings were greatly 
improved. Nash adopted an outward state corresponding to his 
nominal dignity. He wore an immense white hat as a sign of 
office, and a dress adorned with rich embroidery, and drove in 
a chariot with six greys, laced lackeys and French horns. When 
the act of parliament against gambling was passed in 1745, he 
was deprived of an easy though uncertain means of subsistence, 
but the corporation afterwards granted him a pension of six score 
guineas a year, which, with the sale of his snuff-boxes and other 
trinkets, enabled him to support a certain faded splendour 
till his death on the 3rd of February 1762. He was honoured 
with a public funeral at the expense of the town. Notwith- 
standing his vanity and impertinence, the tact, energy and 
superficial cleverness of Nash won him the patronage and notice 
of the great, while the success of his ceremonial rule, as shown 
in the increasing prosperity of the town, secured him the gratitude 
of the corporation and the people generally. He was a man of 
strong personality, and considerably more able than Beau 
Brummell, whose prototype he was.

NASHE (or Nash), THOMAS (1567-1601), English poet, 
playwright and pamphleteer, was born at Lowestoft in 1567. 
His father belonged to an old Herefordshire family, and is 
vaguely described as a " minister." Nashe spent nearly seven 
years, 1582 to 1589, at St John's College, Cambridge, taking 
his B.A. degree in 1585-1586. On leaving the university he tried, 
like Greene and Marlowe, to make his living in London by 



literature. It is probable that his first effort was The Anatomic of 
Absurditie (1589) which was perhaps written at Cambridge, 
although he refers to it as a forthcoming publication in his 
preface to Greene's Menapkon (1589). In this preface, addressed 
to the gentlemen students of both universities, he makes boister- 
ous ridicule of the bombast of Thomas Kyd and the English 
hexameters of Richard Stanihurst, but does not forget the praise 
of many good books. Nashe was really a journalist born out of 
due time; he boasts of writing " as fast as his hand could trot "; 
he had a brilliant and picturesque style which, he was careful to 
explain, was entirely original; and in addition to his keen sense 
of the ridiculous he had an abundance of miscellaneous learning. 
As there was no market for his gifts he fared no better than the 
other university wits who were trying to live by letters. But 
he found an opening for his ready wit and keen sarcasm in 
the Martin Marprelate controversy. His share in this war of 
pamphlets cannot now be accurately determined, but he has, 
with more or less probability, been credited with the following: 
A Counter cuffe given to Martin Junior (1589), Martins Months 
Minde (1589), The Reiurntof the renowned Cavalier Pasquill 
and his Meeting with Marforius (1 589), The First Parte of Pasquils 
Apologie (1590), and An Almond for a Parrot (1500). He edited 
an unauthorized edition of Sidney's poems with an enthusiastic 
preface in 1 591, and A Wonderftdl Astrologicall Prognostication, 
in ridicule of the almanac-makers, by " Adam Foule weather," 
which appeared in the same year, has been attributed to him. 
Pierce Penilesse, His Supplication to the Divell, published in 1592, 
shows us his power as a humorous critic of national manners, and 
tells incidentally how hard he found it to live by the pen. It 
seems to Pierce a monstrous thing that brainless drudges wax 
fat while " the seven liberal sciences and a good leg will scarce 
get a scholar bread and cheese." In this pamphlet, too, Nashe 
began his attacks upon the Harveys by assailing Richard, 
who had written contemptuously of his preface to Greene's 
Menapkon. Greene died in September 1592, and Richard's 
brother, Gabriel Harvey, at once attacked his memory in his 
Foure Letters, at the same time adversely criticizing. Pierce 
Penilesse. Nashe replied, both for Greene and for himself, 
in Strange Newes of the intercepting certaine Letters, better known, 
from the running title, as Foure Letters Confuted (1592), in which 
all the Harveys are violently attacked. The autumn of 1592 
Nashe seems to have spent at or near Croydon, where he wrote 
his satirical masque of Summers Last Will and Testament at 
a safe distance from London* and the plague. He afterwards 
lived for some months in the Isle of Wight under the patronage 
of Sir George Carey, the governor. In 1593 he wrote Christs 
Teares over Jerusalem, in the first edition of which he made 
friendly overtures to Gabriel Harvey. These were, however, 
in a second edition, published in the following year, replaced 
by a new attack, and two years later appeared the most violent 
of his tracts against Harvey, Have with you to Sajfron-walden, 
or, Gabriell Harveys Hunt is up (1596). In 1599 the controversy 
was suppressed by the archbishop of Canterbury. After 
Marlowe's death Nashe prepared his friend's unfinished tragedy 
of Dido (1596) for the stage. In the next year he was in trouble 
for a play, now lost,, called The Isle of Dogs, for only part of 
which, however, he seems to have been responsible. The 
" seditious and slanderous matter " contained in this play 
induced the authorities to close for a time the theatre at which 
it had been performed, and the dramatist was put in the Fleet 
prison. Besides his pamphlets and his play- writing, Nashe 
turned his energies to novel-writing. He may be regarded as the 
pioneer in the English novel of adventure. He published in 
1594 The Unfortunate Traveller, Or the Life of Jack Wilton, the 
history of an ingenious page who was present at the siege of 
T6rouenne, and afterwards travelled in Italy with t the earl of 
Surrey. It tells the story of the earl and Fair Geraldine, 
describes a tournament held by Surrey at Florence, and relates 
the adventures of Wilton and his mistress Diamante at Rome 
after the earl's return to England. The detailed, realistic 
manner in which Nashe relates his improbable fiction resembles 
that of Defoe. His last work is entitled Lenten Stujfe{i 599)

and is nominally " in praise of the red herring," but really a 
description of Yarmouth, to which place he had retired after 
his imprisonment, written in the best style of a " special corre- 
spondent." Nashe's death is referred to in Thomas Dekker's 
Knight's Conjuring (1607), a kind of sequel to Pierce Penilesse. 
He is there represented as joining his boon companions in the 
Elysian fields " still haunted with the sharp and satirical spirit 
that followed him here upon earth." Had his patrons under- 
stood their duty, he would not, he said, have shortened his days 
by keeping company with pickled herrings. It may therefore 
be reasonably supposed that he died from eating bad and in- 
sufficient food. The date of his death is fixed by an elegy on him 
printed in Fitzgefirey's Affaniae (1601). 

The works of Thomas Nashe were edited by Dr A. B. Grosart in 
1883-1885, and more recently by Ronald B. McKerrow (1904)- 
An account of his work as a novelist may be found in the English 
Novel in the Time of Shakespeare, by J. J. Jusserand (Eng. trans., 
1890). The Unfortunate Traveller was edited with an introduction 
by Edmund Gosse in 1892. See also " Nash's Unfortunate Traveller 
und Head's English Rogue, die beiden Hauptvertreter des englischen 
Schelmenromans," by W. Kollmann in Anglia (Halle, vol. xxii., 1899,

NASHUA, a city and one of the county seats of Hillsboro 
county, New Hampshire, U.S.A., at the confluence of the Nashua 
and Merrimac rivers, 35 m. S.S.E. of Concord and 40 m. N.W. of 
Boston by rail. Pop. (1890) 19,311; (190°) 2 3> 8 9 8 > of whom 
8093 were foreign-born; (1910 census) 26,005. Nashua is 
served by the Boston & Maine railroad, whose several divisions 
centring here give the city commercial importance, and by 
electric lines to Hudson, Litchfield, Pelham, Dracut and 
Tyngsboro. The area of the city in 1906 was 30*71 sq. m. To the 
N.,W. and S.W. of the city there are beautiful hills and moun- 
tains. The church of Saint Francis Xavier and the First Con- 
gregational church are architecturally noteworthy. The city has 
a soldiers' monument, a public library, a court house and two 
hospitals. There is a United States fish hatchery here, and until 
after the close of the 18th century fishing was the principal 
industry of the place, as manufacturing is now. Water-power is 
furnished by the Nashua river and by Salmon Brook, and the 
city is extensively engaged in, manufactures, notably cotton goods, 
boots, shoes, and foundry and machine-shop products. The 
value of the city's factory products increased from $16,096,064 
in 1900 to $12,858,382 in 1905, or 27*4%, and in 1905 Nashua 
ranked second among the manufacturing cities of the state. 
Nashua is one of the oldest interior settlements of the state. The 
first settlement here was established about 1665; and in 1673 the 
township of Dunstable was incorporated by the General Court 
of Massachusetts. In 1741, when the boundary between Massa- 
chusetts and New Hampshire was settled, the jurisdiction of this 
portion of Dunstable was transferred to New Hampshire; five 
years later it was incorporated under the laws of that state; and 
in 1803 the settlement, originally known as Indian Head, was 
incorporated as a village under the name of Nashua, and in 1836 
the township of Dunstable also received the name Nashua. The 
town of Nashville was set apart from the town of Nashua in 1842, 
but the two towns were united under a city charter obtained in 
1853. In 1795 the first stage coach was run through here from 
Boston to Amherst, and at about the same time a canal was 
built around Pawtucket Falls on the Merrimac at Lowell. In 
1822 a manufacturing company was formed, which at once began 
to develop the water-power and in 1825 erected the first cotton 
mill. Thirteen years later the Nashua & Lowell railroad (now 
leased to the Boston & Maine) first reached Nashua.

(Nashua, 1897). 

NASHVILLE, the capital of Tennessee, U.S.A., and the 
county-seat of Davidson county, on the Cumberland river, 186 m. 
• S.S.W. of Louisville, Kentucky. Pop. (1890) 76,168; (1900) 
80,865, °f whom 3037 were foreign-born and 30,044 were negroes; 
(1910 census) 110,364. Nashville is served by the Tennessee 
Central, the Louisville & Nashville, and the Nashville, Chat- 
tanooga & St Louis railways, and by several steamboat lines. 
The Cumberland river is crossed here by four foot-bridges. 
Nashville is situated on and between hills and bluffs in an un- 



dulating valley; its streets are paved with brick or granite 
blocks in the business section and macadamized or paved with 
asphalt in the residential sections. The city has fine public 
buildings, many handsome residences, and several beautiful 
parks. The principal building is the State House, a fine example 
of pure Greek architecture, on the most prominent hill-top, with 
a tower 205 ft. in height. On the grounds about it are a bronze 
equestrian statue of Andrew Jackson, by Clark Mills (181 5-1883), 
and the tomb of President James K. Polk, who lived in Nashville. 
Other prominent buildings and institutions are the United 
States Government Building, the County Court House, the City 
Hall, the Tennessee School for the Blind, the Tennessee Industrial 
School, the State Library, the Library of the State Historical 
Society housed in Watkins Institute, a Carnegie library, park 
buildings, the State Penitentiary, Vend6me Theatre, the Board 
of Trade Building, the City Hospital, the St Thomas Hospital 
(Roman Catholic), and, near the city, a Confederate Soldiers* 
Home and a State Hospital for the Insane. Eleven miles east of 
the city is the " Hermitage," which was the residence of President 
Andrew Jackson. 

The grounds of the Tennessee Centennial Exposition of 1897 
(commemorating the admission of Tennessee into the Union) on 
the west border of the city now constitute Centennial Park, in 
which still stand the reproduced Parthenon of Athens, the 
History Building, which in general outline is a reproduction of 
the Erectheum and contains a museum and an art gallery, and a 
monument to the memory of James Robertson (1742-1814), the 
founder of the city. Besides this there are four other parks: Glen- 
dale Park in the south section, a place of much natural beauty; 
Shelby Park, in the eastern part of the city, fronting the river; 
Watkins Park, on the north; and Cumberland Driving Park. 
In Mount Olivet Cemetery is a beautiful Confederate Soldiers' 
monument surrounded by the graves of 2000 Confederate soldiers, 
and a little to the north of the city is a National Cemetery in 
which 16,643 Federal soldiers are buried, the names of 471 1 of 
them being unknown. 

Nashville is one of the foremost educational centres in the 
Southern states. In the western part of the city is Vanderbilt 
University. This institution, opened in 1875, is under the 
patronage of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South, and was 
named in honour of Cornelius Vanderbilt, who contributed 
$ 1, 000,000 to its funds, and whose son, W. H. Vanderbilt, and 
grandsons, W. K. Vanderbilt and Cornelius Vanderbilt, gave to 
the university about $820,000. It is coeducational and embraces 
an academic department, a biblical department, and departments 
of engineering, law, medicine, pharmacy and dentistry; in 1909 
it had 125 instructors and 959 students. The University of 
Nashville is a non-sectarian institution embracing a college 
department, a medical department, a preparatory department, 
and the George Peabody College for Teachers; it was incorporated 
under the laws of North Carolina as Davidson Academy in 1785 
and under the laws of Tennessee as Cumberland College in 1806, 
and the present name was adopted in 1 826. The George Peabody 
College for Teachers, an important part of the institution, was 
opened as a normal school in 1875; in 1907-1908 it had an 
enrolment (including the summer session) of 647 students. In 
1909 it received $1,000,000 from the Peabody Fund, later supple- 
mented by $250,000 from the state, $200,000 from the city and 
$100,000 from Davidson county. The University of Tennessee, 
located mainly at Knoxvillc, has at Nashville its medical and 
dental departments. Ward Seminary, opened in 1865, Boscobel 
College, opened in 1889, and Buford, Belmont and Radnor colleges 
are all non-sectarian institutions of Nashville for the higher educa- 
tion of women. For the education of negroes the city has Fisk 
University (opened in 1866, incorporated in 1867), under the 
auspices of the American Missionary Association and the Western 
Freedman's Aid Commission of the Congregational Church (noted 
since 1871 for its Jubilee Singers,who raised moneyfor Jubilee Hall, 
finished in 1876) ; it embraces a college department, a preparatory 
department, a normal department and departments of theology, 
music and physical training; and Walden University, founded as 
Central Tennessee College in 1866, under the auspices of the

Methodist Episcopal Church, and embracing a college depart- 
ment, a normal department, an industrial department, and 
departments of English, commerce, law, medicine, dentistry, 
pharmacy, music, bible training, nurse training and domestic 
science. The Baptist, the Methodist Episcopal (South), the 
Cumberland Presbyterian, and the African Baptist and the 
African Methodist Episcopal churches have publishing houses 
in Nashville. 

The leading manufactures of the city are flour and grist mill 
products (valued at $4,242,491 in 1905), lumber and timber 
products — Nashville is one of the greatest hard wood markets in 
the United States, and in 1005 the value of lumber and timber 
products was $1,1 19,162 and of planing-mill products, $1,299,066 
— construction and repair of steam railway cars ($1,724,007 in 
1 90s) j tobacco ($1,3 1 1,019 in 1905), fertilizers ($846,5 n in 1905), 
men's clothing ($720,227 in 1905), saddlery, harness, soap and 
candles. The total value of the products of the factories increased 
from $15,301,096 in 1900 to $23,109,601 (16-8% of the entire 
factory product of the state) in 1905, amounts greater than 
those of any other city in the state. Nashville has a large trade 
in grain, cotton, groceries, dry goods, drugs, and boots and shoes. 
The water-works and the electric lighting plant are owned and 
operated by the municipality. 

Nashville was founded in 1780 as " the advance guard of 
western civilization " by a company of two hundred or more 
pioneers under the leadership of James Robertson, the nearest 
settlement being at the time about three hundred miles distant. 
When first settled it was named Nashborough in honour of Abner 
Nash (17 16-1786), who was at the time governor of North Caro- 
lina, or more probably in honour of the Revolutionary general, 
Francis Nash (1720-177 7), a brother of Abner, killed at German- 
town; but when, in 1784, it was incorporated as a town by the 
North Carolina legislature the present name was substituted. 
In 1806 Nashville was chartered as a city. Although it was not 
made the capital of the state until 1843, the legislature met here 
from 1812 with the exception of the period from 1815 to 1826. 
Many of the pioneers of Nashville were slain by the Creek and 
Cherokee Indians, and at times the settlement was saved from 
destruction only by the heroism of Robertson, but in 1794 the 
savages were dealt a crushing blow at Nickojack on the lower 
Tennessee and much more peaceful relations were established. 
On the 3rd of June 1850 a convention, known as the Southern or 
Nashville Convention, whose action was generally considered 
a threat of disunion, met here to consider the questions at issue 
between the North and the South. Since such a meeting had 
first been proposed by a state convention of Mississippi, the 
famous Compromise Measures of 1850 had been introduced in 
Congress and the support of the movement had been greatly 
weakened thereby except in South Carolina and Mississippi. 
Nine states, however, were represented by about 100 delegates, 
mostly Democrats, and the convention denounced the Wilmot 
Proviso, and, as " an extreme concession on the part of the 
South," promised to agree that, W. of Missouri, there should be 
slavery only in the territory S. of 36 30' N. lat. At an adjourned 
meeting in November it expressed its dissatisfaction with the 
Compromise Measures of Congress, and asserted the right of the 
South to secede. 

During the Civil War Nashville was at first held by the Con- 
federates, but early in 1862 it was occupied by the Federals, 
who retained possession of it to the end. The battle of Nashville 
was fought on the 15th and 16th of December 1864 between 
the Union army under Major-General G. H. Thomas and the 
Confederates under Geneial J. B. Hood. The Union defences 
extended in a semicircle round Nashville, the flanks on the 
river above and below. Hood's army was to the south-east, 
lightly entrenched, with its flanks on two creeks which empty 
into the Cumberland above and below Nashville. This position 
he desired to maintain as long as possible so as to gather recruits 
and supplies in safety. If Thomas, whose army was of motley 
composition, attacked, he hoped to defeat him and to enter 
Nashville on his heels. Thomas, however, would not strike 
until he had his army organized. Then, on the 15th, he emerged 



from the entrenchments and by a vigorous attack on the Con- 
federate left forced back Hood's line to a second position i£ m. 
to the south. Hood, having detached a part of his army, desired 
to gain time to bring in his detachments by holding this line for 
another day. Thomas, however, gave him no respite. On the 
1 6th the Union army deployed in front of him, again over-lap- 
ping his left flank, and although a frontal attack was repulsed, 
the extension of the Federal right wing compelled Hood to 
extend his own lines more and more. Then the Federals broke 
the attenuated line of defence at its left centre, and Hood's 
army drifted away in disorder. The pursuit was vigorous, 
and only a remnant of the Confederate forces reassembled at 
Columbia, 40 m. to the south, whence they fell back without 
delay behind the Tennessee. 

NASI, JOSEPH (16th century), Jewish statesman and financier, 
was born in Portugal of a Jewish (Marano) family. Emigrating 
from his native land, he founded a banking house in Antwerp. 
Despite his financial and social prosperity there, he felt it irk- 
some to be compelled to wear the guise of Catholicism, and 
determined to settle in a Mahommedan land. After two troubled 
years in Venice, Nasi betook himself to Constantinople. Here 
he proclaimed his Judaism, and married his beautiful cousin 
Reyna. He rapidly rose to favour, the sultans Suleiman and 
Selim promoting him to high office. He founded a Jewish colony 
at Tiberias which was to be an asylum for the Jews of the Roman 
Campagna. In 1566 when Selim ascended the throne, Nasi was 
made duke of Naxos. He had deserved well of Turkey, for he 
had conquered Cyprus for the sultan. Nasi's influence was so 
great that foreign powers often negotiated through him for 
concessions which they sought from the sultan. Thus the 
emperor of Germany, Maximilian II., entered into direct corre- 
spondence with Nasi; William of Orange, Sigismund August II., 
king of Poland, also conferred with him on political questions 
of moment. On the death of Selim in r$74, Nasi receded from 
his political position, but retained his wealth and offices, and 
passed the five years of life remaining to him in honoured 
tranquillity at Belvedere (Constantinople). He died in 1579. 
His career was not productive of direct results, but it was of 
great moral importance. It was one of the tokens of the new 
era that was to dawn for the Jews as trusted public officials 
and as members of the state.

NASIK, a town and district of British India, in the central 
division of Bombay. The town is on the Godavari river, con- 
nected by a tramway (5 m.) with Nasik Road railway station, 
107 m. N.E. of Bombay. Pop. (1901) 21,490. It is a very holy 
place of Hindu pilgrimage, being 30 m. from the source of the 
Godavari. Shrines and temples line the river banks, and some 
stand even in the river. In the vicinity there are a number 
of sacred caves, among which those of Pandu Lena are the most 
noteworthy. They are ancient Buddhist caves dating from the 
3rd century before Christ to the 6th century after. There are 
numerous inscriptions of the highest historical value. Nasik 
has manufactures of cotton goods, brass-ware and mineral 
waters. 

The District of Nasik has an area of 5850 sq. m. With 
the exception of a few villages in the west, the whole district 
is situated on a tableland from 1300 to 2000 ft. above sea-level. 
The western portion is hilly, and intersected by ravines, and 
only the simplest kind of cultivation is possihle. The eastern 
tract is open, fertile and well cultivated. The Sahyadri range 
stretches from north to south; the watershed is formed by the 
Chander range, which runs east and west. All the streams 
to the south of that range are tributaries of the Godavari. To 
the north of the watershed, the Girna and its tributary the Mosam 
flow through fertile valleys into the Tapti. The district generally 
is destitute of trees, and the forests which formerly clothed the 
Sahyadri hills have nearly disappeared; efforts are now being 
made to prevent further destruction, and to reclothe some of 
the slopes. The district contains several old hill forts, the scenes 
of many engagements during the Mahratta wars. Nasik district

NASIR KHOSRAU— NASMYTH, A. 



became British territory in 1818 on the overthrow of the peshwa. 
The population in 1901 was 816,504, showing a decrease of 
3 % in the decade. The principal crops are millet, wheat, pulse, 
oil-seeds, cotton and sugar cane. There are also some vineyards 
of old date, and much garden cultivation. Yeola is an important 
centre for weaving silk and cotton goods. There are flour-mills 
at Malegaon, railway workshops at Igatpuri, and cantonments 
at Deolali and Malegaon. At Sharanpur is a Christian village, 
with an orphanage of the C.M.S., founded in 1854. The district 
is crossed by the main line and also by the chord line of the Great 
Indian Peninsula railway. 

NASIR KHOSRAU (Nasiri Khusru), Abu Mu'in-ed-din Nasir b. 
Khosrau (1004-1088), whose nom de plume was Hujjat, the first 
great didactic poet of Persia, was born, according to his own 
statement, a.h. 394 (a.d. 1004), at Kubadiyan, near Balkh in 
Khorasan. The first forty-two years of his life are obscure; 
we learn from incidental remarks of his that he was a Sunnite, 
probably according to the IJanifite rite, well versed in all the 
branches of natural science, in medicine, mathematics, astronomy 
and astrology, in Greek philosophy, and the interpretation of 
the Koran; that he was much addicted to worldly pleasures, 
especially to excessive wine drinking. He had studied Arabic, 
Turkish, Greek, the vernacular languages of India and Sind, 
and perhaps even Hebrew; he had visited Mult an and Lahore, 
and the splendid Ghaznavide court under Sultan Mahmud, 
Firdousl's patron. Later on he chose Merv for his residence, 
and was the owner of a house and garden there. In a.h. 437 
(a.d. 1045) he appears as financial secretary and revenue 
collector of the Seljuk sultan Toghrul Beg, or rather of his brother 
Jaghir Beg, the emir of Khorasan, who had conquered Merv 
in 1037. About this time, inspired by a heavenly voice (which 
he pretends to have heard in a dream), he abjured all the luxuries 
of life, and resolved upon a pilgrimage to the holy shrines of 
Mecca and Medina, hoping to find there the solution of all his 
religious doubts. The graphic description of this journey is 
contained in the Safarnarna, which possesses a special value 
among books of travel, since it contains the* most authentic 
account of the state of the Mussulman world in the middle of 
the nth century. The minute sketches of Jerusalem and its 
environs are even now of practical value. During the seven 
years of his journey (a.d. 1045-105 2) Nasir visited Mecca four 
times, and performed all the rites and observances of a zealous 
pilgrim; but he was far more attracted by Cairo, the capital 
of Egypt, and the residence of the Fatimite sultan Mostansir 
billah, the great champion of the Shf a, and the spiritual as well 
as political head of the house of 'All, which was just then waging 
a deadly war against the 'Abbaside caliph of Bagdad, and the 
great defender of the Sunnite creed, Toghrul Beg the Seljuk. 
At the very time of Nasir's visit to Cairo, the power of the 
Egyptian Fatimites was in its zenith; Syria, the Hejaz, Africa, 
and Sicily obeyed Mostansir's sway, and the utmost order, 
security and prosperity reigned in Egypt. At Cairo he became 
thoroughly imbued with Shf a doctrines, and their introduction 
into his native country was henceforth the sole object of his life. 
The hostility he encountered in the propagation of these new 
religious ideas after his return to Khorasan in 1052 and Sunnite 
fanaticism compelled him at last to flee, and after many wander- 
ings he found a refuge in Yumgan (about 1060) in the mountains 
of Badakshan, where he spent as a hermit the last decades of 
his life, and gathered round him a considerable number of devoted 
adherents, who have handed down his doctrines to succeeding 
generations. 

Most of Nasir's lyrical poems were composed^ in his retirement, 
and their chief topics are^— an enthusiastic praise of 'All, his de- 
scendants, and Mostansir in particular; passionate outcries against 
"Khorasan and its rulers, who had driven him from house and home; 
the highest satisfaction with the quiet solitude of Yumgan; and 
utter despondency again in seeing himself despised by his former 
associates and for ever excluded from participation in the glorious 
contest of life. But scattered through all these alternate outbursts 
of hope and despair we find precious lessons of purest morality, and 
solemn warnings against the tricks and perfidy of the world, the 
vanity of all earthly splendour and greatness, the folly and injustice 
of men, and the hypocrisy, frivolity and viciousness of fashionable 



society and princely courts in particular. It is the same strain 
which runs, although in a somewhat lower key, through his two 
larger mathnawls or double- rhymed poems, the Rushandindma, or 
" book of enlightenment," and the Sa'ddatndma, or " book of feli- 
city." The former is divided into two sections: the first, of a meta- 
physical character, contains a sort of practical cosmography, chiefly 
based on Avicenna's theories, but frequently intermixed both with 
the freer speculations of the well-known philosophical brotherhood 
of Basra, the Ikhwan-es-safa'i,, and purely Shi'ite or Isma'ilite 
ideas; the second, or ethical section of the poem, abounds in moral 
maxims and ingenious thoughts on man's good and bad qualities, 
on the necessity of shunning the company of fools and double-faced 
friends, on the deceptive allurements of the world and the secret 
snares of ambitious craving for rank and wealth. It concludes with 
an imaginary vision of a beautiful world of spirits who have stripped 
off the fetters of earthly cares and sorrows and revel in the pure 
light of divine wisdom and love. If we compare this with a similar 
allegory in Nasir's diwan, which culminates in the praise of Mostansir, 
we are fairly entitled to look upon it as a covert allusion to the 
eminent men who revealed to the poet in Cairo the secrets of the 
Isma'ilitic faith, and showed him what he considered the " heavenly 
ladder " to superior knowledge and spiritual bliss. The passage, thus 
interpreted, lends additional weight to the correctness of Dr Ethe"s 
reconstruction of the date of the Rushandinama, viz. a.h. 440 (a.d. 
1049), which, notwithstanding M. Scheftr's objections, is warranted 
both by the astronomical details and by the metrical requirements 
of the respective verses. That of course does not exclude the possi- 
bility of the bulk of the poem having been composed at an earlier 
period; it only ascribes its completion or perhaps final revision to 
Nasir's sojourn in Egypt. 

A similar series of excellent teachings on practical wisdom and 
the blessings of a virtuous life, only of a severer and more uncom- 
promising character, is contained in the Sa'ddatndma; and, judging 
from the extreme bitterness of tone manifested in the " reproaches 
of kings and emirs," we should be inclined to consider it a protest 
against the vile aspersions poured out upon Nasir's mora! and 
religious attitude during those persecutions which drove him at 
last to Yumgan. Of all the other works of our author mentioned 
by Oriental writers there has as >;et been found only one, the Zdd- 
elmusdjirtn or " travelling provisions of pilgrims " (in the private 
possession of M. Schefer, Paris), a theoretical description of his 
religious and philosophical principles; and we can very well dismiss 
the rest as being probably just as apocryphal as Nasir's famous auto- 
biography (found in several Persian tadhkiras or biographies of 
poets), a mere forgery of the most extravagant description, which is 
mainly responsible for the confusion in names and dates in older 
accounts of our author.

NASMYTH, ALEXANDER (1758-1840), Scottish portrait and 
landscape painter, was born in Edinburgh on the 9th of September 
1758. He studied at the Trustees' Academy under Runciman, 
and, having been apprenticed as an heraldic painter to a coach- 
builder, he, at the age of sixteen, attracted the attention of Allan 
Ramsay, who took the youth with him to London, and employed 
him upon the subordinate portions of his works. Nasmyth 
returned to Edinburgh in 1778, and was soon largely patronized 
as a portrait painter. He also assisted Mr Miller of Dalswinton, 
as draughtsman, in his mechanical researches and experiments; 
and, this gentleman having generously offered the painter a loan 
to enable him to pursue his studies abroad, he left in 1782 for 
Italy, where he remained two years. On his return he painted 



NASMYTH, J.— NASRIDES, THE 



the excellent portrait of Burns, now in the Scottish National 
Gallery, well known through Walker's engraving. Political 
feeling at that time ran high in Edinburgh, and Nasmyth's 
pronounced Liberal opinions, which he was too outspoken and 
sincere to disguise, gave offence to many of his aristocratic 
patrons, and led to the diminution of his practice as a portraitist. 
In his later years, accordingly, he devoted himself mainly to 
landscape work, and did not disdain on occasion to set his hand 
to scene-painting for the theatres. He has been styled, not 
unjustly, the " father of Scottish landscape art." His subjects 
are carefully finished and coloured, but are wanting in boldness 
and freedom. Nasmyth was also largely employed by noblemen 
throughout the country in the improving and beautifying of their 
estates, in which his fine taste rendered him especially skilful; 
and he was known as an architect, having designed the Dean 
Bridge, Edinburgh, and the graceful circular temple covering 
St Bernard's Well. Nasmyth died in his native city on the ioth 
of April 1840. His youngest son, James, was the well-known 
inventor of the steam-hammer. His six daughters all attained 
a certain local reputation as artists, but it was in bis eldest son, 
Patrick (1 787-1 83 1 ), that the artistic skill of his family was most 
powerfully developed. Having studied under his father, Patrick 
went to London at the age of twenty, and soon attracted atten- 
tion as a clever landscapist. He was a diligent student of the 
works of Claude and Richard Wilson, and of Ruysdael and 
Hobbema, upon whom his own practice was mainly founded. 
His most characteristic paintings are of English domestic scenery, 
full of quiet tone and colour, and detailed and minute expression 
of foliage, and with considerable brilliancy of sky effect. They 
were executed with his left hand, his right having in early life 
been injured by an accident. 

For an account of the Nasmyth family see James Nasmyth's 
Autobiography (1883). 

NASMYTH, JAMES (1808-1890), Scottish engineer, was born 
in Edinburgh on the 19th of August 1808, and was the youngest 
son of Alexander Nasmyth, the "father of Scottish landscape 
art." He was sent to school in his native city, and then attended 
classes in chemistry, mathematics and natural philosophy at the 
university. From an early age he showed great fondness for 
mechanical pursuits, and the skill he attained in the practical 
use of tools enabled him to make models of engines, &c, which 
found a ready sale. In' 1829 he obtained a position in Henry 
Maudslay's works in London, where he stayed two years, and 
then, in 1834, started business on his own account in Manchester. 
The beginnings were small, but they quickly developed, and in a 
few years he was at the head of the prosperous Bridgewater 
foundry at Patricroft, from which he was able to retire in 1856 
with a fortune. The invention of the steam-hammer, with which 
his name is associated, was actually made in 1839, a drawing of 
the device appearing in his note-book, or " scheme-book," as he 
called it, with the date 24th November of that year. It was 
designed to meet the difficulty experienced by the builders of 
the Great Britain steamship in finding a firm that would under- 
take to forge the large paddle-wheel shaft required for that 
vessel, but no machine of the kind was constructed till 1842. 
In that year Nasmyth discovered one in Schneiders' Creuzot 
works, and he found that the design was his own and had been 
copied from his " scheme-book." His title, therefore, to be 
called the inventor of the steam-hammer holds good against the 
claims sometimes advanced in favour of the Schneiders, though 
apparently he was anticipated in the idea by James Watt. 
Nasmyth did much for the improvement of machine-tools, and 
his inventive genius devised many new appliances — a planing- 
machine (" Nasmyth steam-arm "), a nut -shaping machine, 
steam pile-driver, hydraulic machinery for various purposes, &c. 
In his retirement he lived at Penshurst in Kent, and amused 
himself with the study of astronomy, and especially of the moon, 
on which he published a work, The Moon considered as a Planet, 
a World and a Satellite, in conjunction with James Carpenter in 
1874. He died in London on the 7th of May 1890. 

# His Autobiography, edited by Dr Samuel Smiles, was published 
in 1883.

NASR-ED-DIN [Nasiru'd-Din] (1829-1896), shah of Persia, 
was born on the 4th of April 1829. His mother, a capable princess 
of the Kajar family, persuaded Shah Mahommed, his father, to 
appoint him heir apparent, in preference to his elder brothers; 
and he was accordingly made governor of Azerbaijan. His 
succession to the throne, 13th October 1848, was vigorously 
disputed, especially by the followers of the reformer El Bab, 
upon whom he wreaked terrible vengeance. In 1855. he re- 
established friendly relations with France, and coming under the 
influence of Russia, signed a treaty of amity on the 17th of 
December with that power, but remained neutral during the 
Crimean war. In 1856 he seized Herat, but a British army under 
Outram landed in the Persian Gulf, defeated his forces and 
compelled him to evacuate the territory. The treaty of peace 
was signed at Paris, on the 4th of March 1857, and to the end of 
his reign he treated Great Britain and Russia with equal friend- 
ship. In 1866 the shah authorized the passage of the telegraph 
to India through his dominions and reminted his currency in the 
European fashion. In 1873, anc * again in 1889, he visited 
England in the course of his three sumptuous journeys to Europe, 
1873,1878,1889. The only results of his contact with Western 
civilization appear to have been the proclamation of religious 
toleration, the institution of a postal service, accession to the 
postal union and the establishment of a bank. He gave the 
monopoly of tobacco to a private company, but was soon com- 
pelled to withdraw it in deference to the resistance of his subjects. 
Abstemious in habits, and devoted to music and poetry, he was 
a cultured, able and well-meaning ruler, and his reign, already 
unusually long for an Eastern potentate, might have lasted still 
longer had it not been for the unpopular sale of the tobacco 
monopoly, which was probably a factor in his assassination at 
Teheran on the 1st of May 1896 by a member of the Babi faction. 
He was succeeded by his son Muzaffar-ed-din. 

NASRIDES, THE, of Granada, were the last of the Mahom- 
medan dynasties in Spain. They ruled from 1232 to 1492. They 
arose at the time when the king of Castile, Fernando the Saint, 
was conquering Andalusia. The dynasty was of remote Arabic 
origin, but its immediate source was the mountain range of the 
Alpujarra, and the founder was Yusuf (or Yahla) l'Nasr, a chief 
who was engaged in perpetual conflict with rival chiefs and in 
particular with the family of Beni-Hud, once kings at Saragossa, 
who held the fortress of Granada. Yusuf's nephew (or son) 
Mahommed completed the defeat of the Beni-Hud largely by the 
help of the king of Castile, to whom he did homage and paid 
tribute. Mahommed I., called el Ghalib, i.e. the Conqueror (r 238- 
1273), served the Christian king against his own co-religionists 
at the siege of Seville and contrived to escape in the general 
wreck of the Mahommedan power. The internal history of the 
dynasty is largely made up of civil dissensions, personal rivalries, 
palace and harem intrigues. The direct male line of Mahommed 
el Ghalib ended with the fourth sultan, Nasr, in 13 14. Nasr was 
succeeded by his cousin Imail (13 14-13 25), who is said to have 
been connected with the original stock only through women. 
From Mahommed el-Ghalib to Mahommed XL, called Boabdil, 
and also the little king " El Rey Cbico " by the Christians, who lost 
Granada in 1492, there are counted twenty-nine reigns of the 
Nasrides, giving an average of nine years. But there was not the 
same number of sultans, for several of them were expelled and 
restored two or three times. Nor did all the members of the 
house who were allowed to have been sultans reign over all the 
territory still in Mahommedan hands. There were .contemporary 
reigns in different parts, and tribal or local rivalries between 
plain and hill, and the chief towns, Granada, Malaga and Guadix. 
The dissensions of the Nasrides reached their greatest pitch of 
fury during the very years in which the Catholic sovereigns were 
conquering their territory piecemeal, 1482-1492. Their position 
imposed a certain consistency of policy on these sultans. They 
submitted and paid tribute to the kings of Castile when they 
could not help doing so, but they endeavoured to use the support 
of Mahommedan rulers of northern Africa whenever it was to be 
obtained. Granada became the recognized place of refuge for 
rebellious subjects of the kings of Castile, and on occasion

supported them against rebels. The end came when the weakness 
of Mahommedan rulers in Morocco coincided with the rule of 
strong sovereigns in Castile. Frontier wars between Mahom- 
medan and Christian borderers were incessant, and at long 
intervals the kings of Castile made invasions on a considerable 
scale, without, however, following up any successes they might 
gain. The comparative prosperity of Granada was due to the 
concentration of a large population driven from other parts of 
Spain, and the consequent necessity for the intensive cultivation 
of the rich valleys lying among the ranges of mountains which 
encircle the kingdom, and the extensive " Vega " or plain of 
Granada. The reputation for civilization which the agitated 
Mahommedan state enjoys in history is based on the surviving 
parts of the highly decorated fortress palace of the Alhambra, 
which was mainly the work of three of the sultans, the founder, 
Mahommed el Ghalib, and his two successors.

NASSARAWA, a province of the British protectorate of 
northern Nigeria, lying approximately between 6° 40' and 9 E. 
and between 7 40' and 9 40' N. It is situated on the northern 
bank of the river Benue, which in its windings forms the southern 
frontier of the province. Nassarawa is bounded E. by the 
province of Muri, N.E. by Bauchi, N. by Zaria and W. by Nupe 
and the trans-Nigerian portion of the province of Kabba. It 
has an area of 18,000 sq. m. and an estimated population of 
1,500,000. The province, like that of Bauchi, is traversed 
by mountainous regions. It possesses valuable forests and 
many fertile river valleys. Native products include rubber, 
palm kernels and beni seed. Cotton is grown extensively. 

Until the middle of the 18th century Nassarawa appears to have 
been peopled by many native tribes of a primitive type. About 
1750 an important pagan tribe, the Igbira, came from the south- 
west across the Niger and established two rival kingdoms in the 
western portion of the province. Later the native inhabitants 
of Zaria, driven before the Fula, came from the north and 
occupied the central portion of Nassarawa. Later still (about 
1840) certain Fula of Zaria themselves conquered portions of 
the province, founded Keffi, spread as far as the Benue in the 
south-west corner and occupied the town and district of Abuja 
in the west. Fula also made a settlement at the town of 
Nassarawa and at Darroro in the N.E. A colony from Bornu 
entered the province and founded the important town of Lafia 
Berebere in the eastern district. As a result of these movements 
the aboriginal tribes were driven into the hilly regions of the S.E. 
and N.E. The Munshi, a truculent and hardy people, hold a 
portion of the northern bank of the Benue, and the Kagoro and 
Attakar tribes hold the hilly country to the N.E., through 
which the road passes from Keffi and Lafia to the Bauchi high- 
lands. Before the British occupation the state of Nassarawa had 
become a partially subdued Fula emirate, exercising doubtful 
sway over the native pagans and paying a scarcely less doubtful 
allegiance on its own part to the Fula ruler of Zaria. The riverain 
tribes of Nassarawa were among the first to break into open 
aggression against the British administration established at 
Lokoja. In January 1900 they attacked a telegraph construc- 
tion party in the Munshi country on the banks of the Benue. 
The result was the occupation of Keffi by British troops and 
the gradual subjugation of the province. In 1902 the first 
British resident, Captain Moloney, was murdered at Keffi by 
an official of the emir's court. The emir repudiated all re- 
sponsibility for the crime, and the murderer fled to Kano, 
where his reception on friendly terms was among the incidents 
- which determined the Sokoto-Kano campaign of 1903. The 
British were now recognized as the rulers of Nigeria, and the 
emir of Nassarawa threw in his lot with the British government. 
Slave raiding was abolished and the slave trade made illegal. 
A British court of justice was established at the provincial head- 
quarters and native courts in every district. Roads have been 
opened and trade is steadily increasing. In 1905 an expedition 
was required against the Kagoro people, who occupy a vast open 



plateau having an elevation of about 1800 ft. through which a 
short road to the Bauchi tin mines passes from the Benue. 
These people had been raiding the Fula for cattle and murdering 
traders upon the road. A splendid grazing country, healthy 
and also rich in rubber, was opened. The road to the tin mines 
was rendered safe and is now the Bauchi mail route. There is a 
cart road from Loko on the Benue to Keffi. (F. L. L.) 

NASSAU, a territory of Germany, now forming the bulk of the 
government district of Wiesbaden, in the Prussian province of 
Hesse-Nassau, but until 1866 an independent and sovereign duchy 
of Germany. It consists of a compact mass of territory, 1830 
sq. m. in area, bounded on the S. and W. by the Main and Rhine, 
on the N. by Westphalia and on the E. by Hesse. This territory 
is divided into two nearly equal parts by the river Lahn, which 
flows from east to west into the Rhine. The southern half is 
almost entirely occupied by the Taunus Mountains, which 
attain a height of 2900 ft. in the Great Feldberg, while to the 
north of the Lahn is the barren Westerwald, culminating in 
the Salzburgerkopf (2000 ft.). The valleys and low-lying 
districts, especially the Rheingau, are very fertile, producing 
abundance of grain, flax, hemp and fruit; but by far the most 
valuable product of the soil is its wine, which includes several of 
the choicest Rhenish varieties, such as Johannisberger, Marco- 
brunner and Assmannshauser. Nassau is one of the most thickly 
wooded regions in Germany, about 42% of its surface being 
occupied by forests, which yield good timber and harbour large 
quantities of game. The rivers abound in fish, the salmon 
fisheries on the Rhine being especially important. There are 
upwards of a hundred mineral springs in the district, most of 
which formerly belonged to the duke, and afforded him a con- 
siderable part of his revenue. The best known are those of 
Wiesbaden, Ems, Soden, Schwalbach, Schlangenbad, Geilnau 
and Fachingen. The other mineral wealth of Nassau includes 
iron, lead, copper, building stone, coals, slate, a little silver 
and a bed of malachite. Its manufactures, including cotton 
and woollen goods, are unimportant, but a brisk trade is carried 
on by rail and river in wine, timber, grain and fruit. There are 
few places of importance besides the above-named spas; Hochst 
is the only manufacturing town. Wiesbaden, with 100,955 
inhabitants, is the capital of the government district as it 
was of the duchy. In 1864 the duchy contained 468,311 in- 
habitants, of whom 242,000 were Protestants, 215,000 Roman 
Catholics and 7000 Jews. The ecclesiastical jurisdiction was 
in the hands of the Protestant bishop of Wiesbaden and the 
Roman Catholic bishop of Limburg. Education was amply 
provided for in numerous higher and lower schools. The annual 
revenue of the dukedom was about £400,000 and it furnished a 
contingent of 6000 men to the army of the German Confederation. 

History. — During the Roman period the district enclosed by 
the Rhine, the Main and the Lahn was occupied by the Mattiaci 
and later by the Alamanni. The latter were subdued by the 
Franks under Clovis at the end of the 5th century, and at the 
partition of Verdun in 843 the country became part of the East 
Frankish or German kingdom. Christianity seems to have been 
introduced in the 4th century. The founder of the house of 
Nassau is usually regarded as a certain Drutwin (d. 1076), 
who, with his brother Dudo, count of Laurenburg, built a castle 
on a hill overlooking the Lahn, near the present town of Nassau. 
Drutwin's descendant Walram (d. 1198) took the title of count of 
Nassau, and placed his lands under the immediate suzerainty 
of the German king; previously he had been a vassal of the arch- 
bishop of Trier. Then in 1255 Walram's grandsons, Walram 
and Otto, divided between them their paternal inheritance, 
which had been steadily increasing in size. Walram took the 
part of Nassau lying on the left bank of the Lahn and made 
Wiesbaden his residence; Otto took the part on the right bank 
of the river and his capital was Siegen. The brothers thus founded 
the two branches of the house of Nassau, which have flourished 
to the present time. 

The fortunes of the Ottonian, or younger line, belong mainly 
to the history of the Netherlands. The family was soon divided 
into several branches, and in the 1 5th century one of its members,

Count Engelbert I. (d. 1442), obtained through marriage lands 
in Holland. Of his two sons one took the Dutch, and the other 
the German possessions of the house, but these were united again 
in 1504 under the sway of John, count of Nassau-Dillenburg, 
the head of a branch of the family which, in consequence of a 
series of deaths, the last of which took place in 1561, was a few 
years later the sole representative of the descendants of Count 
Otto. John's son was Count William the Rich (d. 1559), and his 
grandson was the hero, William the Silent, who inherited the 
principality of Orange in 1544 and surrendered his prospective 
inheritance. in Nassau to his brother John (d. 1606). William 
and his descendants were called princes of Orange-Nassau, and 
the line became extinct when the English king William III. 
died in 1702. Meanwhile the descendants of Count John, 
the rulers of Nassau, were flourishing. They were divided into 
several branches, and in 1702 the head of one of these, John 
William Friso of Nassau-Dietz (d. 1711), whose ancestor had been 
made a prince of the Empire in 1654, inherited the title of prince 
of Orange and the lands of the English king in the Netherlands. 
A few years later in 1743 a number of deaths left John William's 
son, William, the sole representative of his family, and as such 
he ruled over the ancestral lands both in Nassau and in the 
Netherlands. In 1806, however, these were taken from a 
succeeding prince, William VI., because he refused to join the 
Confederation of the Rhine. Some of them were given in 181 5 
to the other main line of the family, the one descended from 
Count Walram (see below). In 181 5 William VI. became king 
of the Netherlands as William I., and was compensated for this 
loss by the grant of parts of Luxemburg and the title of grand- 
duke. When in 1890 William's male line died out Luxemburg, 
like Nassau, passed to the descendants of Count Walram. In 
the female line he is now represented by the queen of the 
Netherlands. 

Adolph of Nassau, a son of Walram, the founder of the elder 
line of the house of Nassau, became German king in 1292, but 
was defeated and slain by his rival, Albert of Austria, in 1298. 
The territories of his descendants were partitioned several 
times, but these branch lines did not usually perpetuate them- 
selves beyond a few generations, and Walram's share of Nassau 
was again united in 1605 under Louis II. of Nassau-Weilburg 
(d. 1626). Soon, however, the family was again divided; three 
branches were formed, those of Saarbriicken, Idstein and Weil- 
burg, the heads of the first two becoming princes of the Empire 
in 1688. Other partitions followed, but at the opening of the 
19th century only two lines were flourishing, those of Nassau- 
Usingen and Nassau-Weilburg. In 1801 Charles William, 
prince of Nassau-Usingen, was deprived by France of his lands 
on the left bank of the Rhine, but both he and Frederick William 
of Nassau-Weilburg, who suffered a similar loss, received ample 
compensation. In 1806 both Frederick William and Frederick 
Augustus, the brother and successor of Charles William, joined 
the Confederation of the Rhine and received from Napoleon 
the title of duke, but after the battle of Leipzig they threw in 
their lot with the allies, and in 1815 joined the German Con- 
federation. As a result of the changes of 181 5 Frederick Augustus 
of Nassau-Usingen ceded some of his newly-acquired lands to 
Prussia, receiving in return the greater part of the German 
possessions of the Ottonian branch of the house of Nassau (see 
above). In March 18 16 he died without sons and the whole 
of Nassau was united under the rule of Frederick William of 
Nassau-Weilburg as duke of Nassau. Already in 18 14 Frederick 
William had granted a constitution to his subjects, which pro- 
vided for two representative chambers, and under his son William, 
who succeeded in 1816, the first landtag met in 1818. At once, 
however, it came into collision with the duke about the ducal 
domains, and* these dissensions were not settled until 1836. 
In this year the duchy took an important step in the develop- 
ment of its material prosperity by joining the German Zollverein. 
In 1848 Duke Adolph, the son and successor of Duke William, 
was compelled to yield to the temper of the times and to grant 
a more liberal constitution to Nassau, but in the following years 
a series of reactionary measures reduced matters to their former 



unsatisfactory condition. The duke adhered stedfastly to his 
conservative principles, while his people showed their sympathies 
by electing one liberal landtag after another. In 1866 Adolph 
espoused the cause of Austria, sent his troops into the field and 
asked the landtag for money. This was refused, Adolph was 
soon a fugitive before the Prussian troops, and on the 3rd of 
October 1866 Nassau was formally incorporated with the 
kingdom of Prussia. The deposed duke entered in 1867 into a 
convention with Prussia by which he retained a few castles and 
received an indemnity of about £1,500,000 for renouncing his 
claim to Nassau. In 1890, on the extinction of the collateral line 
of his house, he hecame grand-duke of Luxemburg, and he died 
on the 17th of November 1905. 

The town of Nassau (Lat. Nasonga) on the right bank of the 
Lahn, 15 m. above Coblenz, is interesting as the birthplace of 
the Prussian statesman, Freiherr von Stein. Pop. (1905) 2238. 
It has a Roman Catholic and an Evangelical church, while its 
main industries are brewing and mining. Near the town are 
the ruins of the castle of Stein, first mentioned in 1138, with a 
marble statue of Stein, while the ruins of the ancestral castle 
of the house of Nassau may also be seen.

NAST, THOMAS (1540-1902), American caricaturist, was born 
on the 27 th of September 1840, in the military barracks of 
Landau, Germany, the son of a musician in the Ninth regiment 
Bavarian band. His mother took him to New York in 1846. 
He studied art there for about a year with Theodore Kaufmann 
and then at the school of the National Academy of Design. 
At the age of fifteen he became a draughtsman for Frank 
Leslie 7 s Illustrated Newspaper; three years afterwards for 
Harper's Weekly. In i860 he went to England for the New 
York Illustrated News to depict the prize-fight between Heenan 
and Sayers, and then joined Garibaldi in Italy as artist for 
The Illustrated London News. His first serious work in caricature 
was the cartoon " Peace " in 1862, directed against those in 
the North who opposed the prosecution of the Civil War. This 
and his other cartoons during the Civil War and Reconstruction 
days were published in Harper's Weekly; they attracted great 
attention, and Nast was called by President Lincoln " our best 
recruiting sergeant." Even more able were Nast's cartoons 
against the Tweed Ring conspiracy in New York city; his 
caricature of Tweed being the means of the latter's identifica- 
tion and arrest at Vigo. In 1873, 1885 and 1887 Nast toured 
the United States as lecturer and sketch-artist, but with the 
advent of new methods and younger blood his vogue decreased. 
He had been an ardent Republican in his earlier years; had 
bitterly attacked President Johnson and his Reconstruction 
policy; had ridiculed Greeley's candidature, and had opposed 
inflation of the currency, notably with his famous " rag-baby " 
cartoons, but his advocacy of civil service reform and his distrust 
of Blaine forced him to become a Mugwump and in 1884 an open 
supporter of the Democratic party, from which in 1892 he re- 
turned to the Republican party and the support of Harrison. 
He had lost practically all of his earnings by the failure of Grant 
and Ward, and in May 1902 was appointed by President Roosevelt 
consul-general at Guayaquil, Ecuador, where he died on the 7th 
of December in the same year. He did some painting in oil 
and some book illustrations, but these were comparatively 
unimportant, and his fame rests on his caricatures and political 
cartoons. Nast introduced the donkey to typify the Democratic 
party, the elephant to typify the Republican party, and the 
tiger to typify Tammany Hall, and introduced into American 
cartoons the practice of modernizing scenes from Shakespeare 
for a political purpose.

NASTURTIUM— NATAL 



NASTURTIUM, or Indian cress, Tropaeolum majus, a 
perennial climber, native of Peru, but in cultivation treated 
as a hardy annual. It climbs by means of the long stalk of the 
peltate leaf which is sensitive to contact like a tendril. The 
irregular flowers have five sepals united at the base, the dorsal 
one produced into a spurred development of the axis; of the 
five petals the two upper are slightly different and stand rather 
apart from the lower three; the eight stamens are unequal and 
tbe pistil consists of three carpels which form a fleshy fruit 
separating into three one-seeded portions. The flowers are 
sometimes eaten in salads, and the leaves and young green fruits 
are pickled in vinegar as a substitute for capers. The pungency 
of the nasturtium officinale, the water-cress, gave it its name 
nasi-tortium, that which twists the nose. The plant should 
have a warm situation, and the soil should be light and well 
enriched; sow thinly early in April, either near a fence or wall, 
or in an open spot, where it will require stakes 6 to 8 ft. high. 

The dwarf form known as Tom Thumb (7\ w. nanum), is an 
excellent bedding or border flower, growing about a foot high. 
Sow in April in the beds or borders; and again in May for a 
succession. Other fine annual Tropaeolums are T. Lobbianum 
with long spurred orange flowers and numerous varieties; and 
r. minus, a kind of miniature T. majus with yellow, scarlet and 
crimson varieties. 

The genus Tropaeolum, native of South America and Mexico, 
includes about 35 species of generally climbing annual and 
perennial herbs with orange, yellow, rarely purple or blue, 
irregular flowers, 7\ peregrinum is the well-known canary 
creeper. The flame nasturtium with brilliant scarlet blossoms 
is r. speciosum from Chile; it has tuberous roots, as have also 
such well-known perennials as 7\ polyphyllum, 7 1 . pentaphyllum. 
Of these T. speciosum should be grown in England in positions 
facing north; it flourishes in Scotland. 

NATAL, a maritime province of the Union of South Africa, 
situated nearly between 27 and 31 S., 29 and 33 E. It is 
bounded S.E. by the Indian Ocean, S.W. by the Cape province 
and Basutoland, N.W. by tbe Orange Free State province, N. 
and N.E. by the Transvaal and Portuguese East Africa. It has a 
coast line of 376 m.; its greatest length N. to S. in a direct line 
is 247 m.; its greatest breadth E. to W., also in a direct line, 
200 m. Natal has an area of 35,371 sq. m., being nearly three- 
quarters the size of England. (For map see South Africa.) 
The province consists of two great " divisions, namely Natal 
proper and Zululand (q.v.) . Natal proper has a seaboard of 1 66 m. 
and an area of 24,910 sq. m., Zululand, in which is included 
Amatongaland, a seaboard of 210 m. and an area of 10,461 sq. m. 
It lies north-east of Natal. In this article the description of the 
physical features, &c. refers only to Natal proper. 

Physical Features. — The terrace formation of the land char- 
acteristic of other coast regions of South Africa prevails in Natal. 
The country may be likened to a steep and gigantic staircase 
leading to a broad and level land lying beyond its borders. 
The rocky barrier which shuts off this land is part of the Drakens- 
berg range. From the mountain sides flow many rivers which 
dash in magnificent waterfalls and through deep gorges to the 
. sea. Falling 8000 or more feet in little over 200 m., these streams 
are unnavigable. The south-eastern sides of the mountains are 
in part covered with heavy timber, while the semi-tropical 
luxuriance of the coast belt has earned for Natal tbe title of 
" the garden colony." 

The coast trends, in an almost unbroken line, from S.W.to N.E. 
It extends from the mouth of the Uintamvuna river (31 4' S., 
30 12' E.), which separates Natal from the Cape, to the mouth .of 
the Tugela (29 15' S., 31 30' E.), which marks the frontier 
between Natal and Zululand. The only considerable indentation 
is at Durban, about two-thirds of the distance from the Umtam- 
vuna to the Tugela, where there is a wide and shallow bay, 
• covering with its islands nearly 8 sq. m. The coast, though low 
and sandy in places, is for the most part rocky and dangerous. 
The warm Mozambique current sweeps down from the N.E., 
setting up a back drift close in shore. The southern entrance 
to Durban harbour is marked by a bold bluff, the Bluff of Natal, 



which is 250 ft. high and forested to the water's edge. Opposite 
the Bluff a low sandy spit called the Point forms the northern 
entrance to the harbour. North of Durban the coast belt, 
hitherto very narrow, widens out and becomes more flat. But 
the greater part of the coast region, which has an average depth 
of 15 m., is broken and rugged. Ranges of hills lead to the first 
plateau, which has an average elevation of 2000 ft. and is of 
ill-defined extent. Here the land loses its semi-tropical character 
and resembles more the plains of the Orange Free State and the ' 
Transvaal. The second plateau, reached by a steep ascent, 
has an elevation of from nearly 4000 to fully 5000 St. It is an 
undulating plain, grass-covered, but for the most part without 
trees or bush. It continues to the foot of the Drakensberg range, 
the mountains rising towards the S.W., with almost perpendicular 
sides, 6000 to 7000 ft. above the country at their base. North- 
west, towards the Transvaal, the mountains are of lower elevation 
and more rounded contours. 

Mountains. — Although the division of the country into terraces 
separated by ranges of hills is clearly marked in various districts, 
as for instance between Durban and Colenso, the province is traversed 
by many secondary chains, as well as by spurs of the Drakensberg. 
The highest points of that range, and the highest land in Africa south 
of Kilimanjaro, lie within the borders of Natal. The Drakensberg 
(q.v.), from Majuba Hill on the N.W. to Bushman's Nek in the S.W., 
form the frontier of the province, the crest of the range being gener- 
ally within Natal. This is the case in the Mont-aux-Sources (11,170 
ft.) and Cathkin Peak or Champagne Castle (10,357 ft.); the top of 
the third great height, Giant's Castle (9657 ft.), is in Basutoland, but 
its seaward slopes are in Natal. From Giant's Castle to Mont-aux- 
Sources, in which, forsaking their general direction, the Drakensberg 
run S.E. to N.W., the mountains attain an elevation of 10,000 to 
1 1,000 ft., with few breaks in their face. North of Mont-aux-Sources 
the mountain ridge sinks to 8000 and less feet, and here are several 
passes leading into the Orange Free State. Laing's Nek is a pass 
into the Transvaal. The chief heights in Natal between Mont-aux- 
Sources and Laing's Nek are Tintwa (7500 ft.), Inkwelo (6808 ft.) 
and the flat-topped Majuba (7000 ft.). Spurs from the Drakensberg, 
at right angles to the main range, cross the plateaus. The most 
northern, which runs E. from Majuba to the Lebombo Mountains, 
coincides roughly with the northern frontier of Natal. It is one of 
the transverse chains connecting the eastern coast range with the 
higher terraces and goes under a variety of names, such as Elands 
Berg and Ingome Mountains. A second range, the Biggarsberg, 
starts from the Drakensberg near Mount Malani and goes E.S.E. 
tothe junction of Mooi, Buffalo and Tugela rivers. This range con- 
tains, in Indumeni (7200 ft.), the highest mountain in Natal outside 
the main Drakensberg. A third range runs N.E. from Giant's Castle 
towards the Biggarsberg. It lies north of the Mooi river, and its 
most general name is Mooi River Heights. A fourth range also 
diverges from Giant's Castle and ramifies in various branches over 
a large tract of country, one branch running by Pietermaritzburg 
to the Berea hills overlooking Durban. The chief height in this 
fourth range is Spion Kop (7037 ft.), about 25 m. S.E. of Giant's 
Castle. This is not the Spion Kop rendered famous during the 
Anglo- Boer War of 1899-1902. That Spion Kop, with Vaal Kranz 
and Pieter's Hills, arc heights on the northern bank of the upper 
Tugela. 

Secondary ranges with heights of 5000 and more feet are numerous, 
whilst lofty isolated mountains rise from the plateaus. The greatest 
of these isolated masses is Mahwaqa (6834 ft.), in the south-west 
part of the country. Of many flat-topped hills the best known is the 
Table Mountain east of Pietermaritzburg. 

Rivers. — All the rivers of Natal not purely coast streams have 
their origin in the Drakensberg or its secondary ranges. The largest 
and longest, the Tugela, with the Buffalo, Mooi, Klip and other 
tri butanes is treated separately. The Tugela basin drains the 
whole country north of a line drawn in a direct line east from Giant's 
Castle. The Umkomaas (" gatherer of waters ") rises in Giant's 
Castle and flows in a south-easterly course to the sea. Though it 
makes no large sweeps it has so tortuous a course that its length 
(some 200 ml) is twice that of the valley through which it flows. 
Its banks in its upper course are wild and picturesque, with occasional 
wide deep vallevs, with climate and vegetation resembling the coast 
belt. The Umzimkulu river rises in Bamboo Castle, in the Drakens- 
berg, and, with bolder curves than the Umkomaas, runs in a course 
generally parallel with that stream S.E. to the sea, its mouth being 
about 40 m. south of that of the Umkomaas. The Ingwangwane 
rises in the Drakensberg south of the Umzimkulu, which it joins 
after a course of some 50 m. Below the junction the Umzimkulu 
forms for some distance the frontier between Natal and the Griqua- 
land East division of the Cape. The scenery along the river valley 
(120 m. long) is very striking, in turns rugged and desolate, verdant 
and smiling, with patches of dense forest and heights wooded to 
their summit. Port Shepstone is situated at the mouth of the river, 
which, like that of all others in Natal, is obstructed by a bar. As a 



NATAL 



253 



result of harbour works, however, a channel has been cleared and 
steamers can ascend the river for 6 m. 

The Pongola rises in the Transvaal in high ground N.E. of Wakker- 
stroom and flows E., forming, for the greater part of its course, the 
northern frontier of the province. After piercing the Lebombo 
Mountains, it turns N. and joins the Maputa, a river emptying into 
Delagoa Bay. The Umgeni, which rises in the Spion Kop hills some 
30 m. S.E. of Giant's Castle, passes through the central part of Natal 
and reaches the sea 4 m. N. of Durban. It flows alternately through 
mountainous and pastoral country, and is known for two magnificent 
waterfalls, both within 12 m. of Pietermaritzburg. The upper fall 
is close to the village of Howick. Here the Umgeni leaps in a single 
sheet of water down a precipice over 350 ft. high, pore than double 
the height of Niagara, forming, when the river is swollen by the 
rains, a spectacle of rare magnificence. Some 12 m. below are the 
Karkloof or Lower Falls, where in a series of beautiful cascades 
the water descends to the plain. Other rivers of Natal which rise 
in the spurs of the Drakensberg or in the higher terraces are the 
Umvoti, which runs south of the Tugela and gives its name to a 
county division, the Umlaas (which gives Durban its main water 
supply, the lllovo, which traverse the country between the 
Umgeni and Umkomaas, and the Umtamvuna, noteworthy as 
forming the boundary between Natal and Pondoland. There are 
also seventeen distinct coast streams in the colony. 

[Geology.* — The general geological structure of Natal and Zululand 
is simple. It consists of a series of plateaus formed of sedimentary 
rocks which mainly belong to three formations of widely separated 
ages, and which rest on a platform of granitic and metamorphic 
rocks. 

The geological formations represented include : — 



Post-Cretaceous 
and Recent 
Cretaceous . 

U. Karroo . 



L. Karroo . 
Cape System 
Pre-Cape Rocks 



Littoral of Zululand. 
'Plateau Basalts. 

Cave Sandstone. 

Red Beds. 

Stormberg Series.

Ecca Series. 

Ecca Glacial Series (Dwyka Conglomerate). 

Table Mountain Sandstone Series. 

Quartzites, Conglomerates and Shales of 
Nkandhla, Umfolosi river. 

Gneisses, Schists, Marbles, Granites (Swazi- 
{ land Series). 

Pre-Cape Rocks. — The granites and schists occur in close associa- 
tion. The series covers considerable areas in the lowest parts of the 
valleys and near the coast. The widest areas are in Zululand. In the 
Umzimkulu river and in the Tugela river below its junction with the 
Buffalo, metamorphic limestones are associated with schists, gneisses 
and granites. A group of highly inclined quartzites, altered con- 
glomerates and vasperoid rocks which crop out on the Umhlatuzi 
river, between Melmoth and Nkandhla and on the White Umfolosi 
river above Ulundi Plains, is considered by Anderson to represent 
some portion of the Lo^er Witwatersrand series. The conglomerates 
are true " banket " and are auriferous, but the gold has not been 
met with in payable quantities. 

Table Mountain Sandstone Series. — This rests unconformably 
on the pre-Cape rocks. Traced northwards, the series becomes 
thinner and finally dies out. As a rule denudation, which has acted 
on a magnificent scale, has removed all but a few hundred feet of 
the basement beds. The maximum thickness of 2000 ft. occurs near 
Melmoth. The beds are usually thin false-bedded sandstones with 
an almost complete absence of shales. A conglomerate at the base 
contains traces of gold. Griesbach mentions the occurrence of some 
small bivalves in the shales of Greytown, but Anderson failed to 
find any fossils. 

Ecca Glacial Series. — A great unconformity separates the Table 
Mountain and Ecca series. In the Cape this gap is represented by 
the Witteberg and Bokkeveld series. The Dwyka conglomerate 
rarely attains any great thickness though forming wide outcrops. 
It is usually a hard compact rock containing striated stones. The 
Umgeni quarries, where the rock is used for road-metal, furnish the 
best exposures. 

Ecca Series. — With the Beaufort series this occupies over two- 
thirds of the western portion of the province and has wide outcrops 
in Zululand and in the Vryheid districts. The Ecca shales contain 
some of the best coals of South Africa, but the seams contain much 
unmarketable coal. Around Dundee and Newcastle the coals are 
bituminous. In Zululand they are chiefly anthracitic. The fossils 
include several species of Glossopteris among them: Glossopteris

Beaufort Series. — The Ecca series graduates upwards into the 
highly coloured sandstones and shales of the Beaufort series. Fossil 
reptilian remains, chiefly Dicynodon, are abundant. 

Stormberg Series. — This consists of sandstones and shales with thin 
seams of coal. The chief outcrops occur around Biggarsberg and 
along the upper slopes of the Drakensberg. The fossil flora — Thinn- 
feldia odoniopter aides, Morr. and a Pterophyllum — indicate a Rhaetic 
age. No reptilian remains have been found. 

Upper Karroo. — The Red beds and Cave sandstones occur along 
the eastern flanks of the Drakensberg. 

Cretaceous. — Deposits of this age^ are confined to the littoral. 
They are exceedingly prolific in fossils which prove them to be of 
Upper Cretaceous age. A long list of fossils has been obtained from 
Umkivelane Hill, Zululand. W.G.*] 

Climate. — With a rise in level (not reckoning the mountain tops) 
of 5500 ft. in a distance of 170 m., Natal possesses several varieties 
of climate but is nowhere unhealthy. The climate is comparable 
to that of north Italy. The valleys and coast belt, though practically 
free from malarial fever, are hot and humid, and fires in dwelling 
houses are seldom required even in the coolest months; the lower 
plateaus are cool and the air dry; the uplands are bracing and 
often very cold, with snow on the ground in winter. The year is 
divided into two seasons, summer, which begins in October and ends 
in March, and winter, which fills up the rest of the year. Summer 
is the rainy season, and May, June and July the driest months of 
the year. Ttoe mean temperature at Durban, records taken at 26a 
ft. above the sea, is 70 F., varying from £2° in winter to 98 in 
summer. The average summer humidity is 76%, that of winter 
74 %. At Pietermaritzburg, 41 m. inland and 2200 ft. above the sea, 
the temperature is about 64 . In the uplands the heat of summer is 
often greater than on the coast, but the air is less humid and the 
nights are generally cool. Both the humidity and the temperature 
are increased by the great mass of water, the Mozambique current, 
flowing south from the equatorial regions. At Durban the annual 
rainfall is about 40 in., at Pietermaritzburg 38. The average for the 
province is believed to be about 30 in. In 1893, the year of highest 
recorded rainfall, 70 in. fell on the coast districts. Thunderstorms, 
averaging nearly one hundred in the year, and violent hailstorms, 
occur in summer, being most severe in the interior. The storms 
serve to modify the intense heat, though the lightning and hail 
cause considerable damage. The prevailing winds on the coast are 
north-east, warm and humid, and south-west, cool and bracing, 
though in summer the south-west wind brings rain. Inland, chiefly 
in early summer, a hot dry wind, often accompanied by a dust 
storm, blows from the north. These winds, which blow on an 
average twenty-five days in the year, seldom reach the coast and are 
generally followed by rain. Inhabitants of Natal are practically 
exempt from chest diseases. 

Flora. — Botanically, Natal is divided into three zones: (1) the 
coast belt, extending from the sea inland to heights of 1500 ft., 
and in some cases to 1800 and 2000 ft.; (2) the midland region, 
which rises to 4000 ft.; (3) the upper regions. In these zones the 
flora varies from sub-tropical to sub-alpine. The heaths and pro- 
teads common at the Cape peninsula, in Basutoland and other parts 
of South Africa, are rare in Natal, but almost any species of the flora 
of semi-tropical and temperatecountriesintroducedattains perfection. 
The trees and plants characteristic of each zone are not always 
confined to that zone, but in several instances, when common to the 
coast belt and the midlands, their character alters according to the 
elevation of the land. The dense bush or jungle of evergreen trees, 
climbers and flowering shrubs, which up to the middle of the 19th 
century covered the greater part of the coast belt, has largely dis- 
appeared. There are still, however, in the coast belt woods of 
leguminous evergreens bearing bright-coloured flowers. The trees 
in these woods are generally from 20 to 50 ft. in height and include 
the knob-thorn, water-boom, kafir-boom (with brilliant scarlet 
flowers)^ the Cape chestnut and milkwoods (Mimusops). But the 
most striking of the coast-belt flora are the tropical forms — the palm, 
mangrove, wild banana (Strelitzia augusta), tree-ferns, tree euphorbia, 
candelabra spurge and Caput medusae. Of palms there are two 
varieties, the ilala {Hyphaene crinita), found only by the sea shore 
and a mile or two inland, and the isundu {Phoenix reclinata), more 
widespread and found at heights up to 2000 ft. or even higher. 
The amatungulu or Natal plum, found chiefly near the sea, is one of 
the few wild plants with edible fruit. Its leaves are of a glossy dark 
green, its] flower white and star-shaped and its fruit resembles the 
plum. Other wild fruits are the so-called Cape gooseberry (not 
native to Natal) and the kaw apple or Dingaan apricot, which grows 
on a species of ebony tree. 

The midland region is characterized by grass lands (the Natal 
grasses are long and coarse) and by considerable areas of flat-topped 
thorn bush mimosa. The bush is not as a rule dense, nor is it of any 
great height. A tree peculiar to this, zone is the Alberta magna. 
It has dull pink flowers, succeeded by seed vessels, each of which is 
crowned by two scarlet-coloured leafy lobes. A grass belt separates 
the thorn bush from the districts carrying heavy timber, found 
mainly in the upland zone, along the sides of the mountains ex- 
posed to the rains and in kloofs. The indigenous timber trees are 



254 



NATAL 



principally the yellow wood (Podocarpus) , sneezewood (Pteroxylon 
utile), stinkwood {Oreodaphne bullata), black iron wood (plea lauri- 
folia), white ironwood (Vepris lanceolaia), and umtomboti (Exoecaria 
africana) ; all are very useful woods, and the yellow wood, sneeze- 
wood, stinkwood and ironwood when polished have grain and 
colour equal to maple, walnut and ebony. # The " rooibesje," red 
pear and milkwood trees are used for boatbuilding. The Australian 
Eucalyptus and Casuarina in great variety, and many other imported 
trees, including syringas, wattles, acacias, willows, pines, cypress, 
cork and oak all thrive when properly planted and protected from 
grass fires. The black wattle has been extensively planted and 
flourishes at elevations of from 1000 to 3000 ft. Its bark forms a 
valuable article of commerce. 

Flowers which bloom in the early spring are abundant, especially 
on the edges of forests. Among those found throughout the country 
are the Dierama pendula, the orchid and the " everlasting." As a 
rule flowers common to all zones are on the coast smaller and with 
paler colours than they are in the midlands. Aloes are common; 
in part of the midland zone they form when in bloom with abundance 
of orange and scarlet flowers a most picturesque sight. Of Cyca- 
daceae the Stangeria paradoxa is peculiar to Natal. There is but 
one cactus indigenous to Natal; it is found hanging from perpen- 
dicular rocks in the midlands. There are, however, several species of 
euphorbia of the miscalled cacti. Climbing plants with gorgeous 
flowers are common, and there are numerous species of Compositae 
and about a hundred cinchonaceous plants. Bulbous plants are 
also very numerous. The most common are the Natal lily with 
pink and white ribbed bells, the fire-lily, with flame-coloured blos- 
soms, ixias, gladiolas, the Ifafa lily, with fuchsia-like clusters, and 
the arum lily. A conspicuous veld plant is the orange and crimson 
leonotis, growing 6 ft. high. Geraniums are somewhat scarce. Fern 
life is abundant; 126 species are indigenous, two being tree-ferns. 
One of these, Cyathea dregei, found in moist places and open land, 
has a stem 20 ft. high; the stem of the other, Hemitelia capensis, 
sometimes reaches 30 ft. The ferns are most common in the midland 
zone and in the heavy timber forests. Sixty different species have 
been identified in one valley not more than 1 m. long and about 
100 yds. in breadth. Among fruit trees, besides the wild fruits 
already mentioned, are the pineapple, mango, papua, guava, grena- 
dilla, rose apple, custard apple, soursop, loquat, naartje, shaddock 
and citrous fruits. 

Fauna. — The larger animals which abounded in Natal in the first 
half of the 19th century have been exterminated or driven out of the 
country. This fate has overtaken the elephant, giraffe, the buffalo, 
quagga, gnu, blesbok, gemsbok and ostrich. If the Vryheid district 
be excluded, the lion < and rhinoceros may be added to this list; 
and the Vryheid district belongs geographically to Zululand. Hip- 
popotami are still found in the Umgeni river and crocodilesin several 
of the coast streams. Leopards and panthers are found in thickly 
wooded kloofs. Hyenas, jackals, wild pig, polecats and wild dogs 
{Cants pictus) of different species are still found in or about bush 
jungles and forest clumps; elands {Antilope oreas) are preserved on 
some estates, and there are at least ten distinct species of antelope 
(hartebeest, bushbok, duiker, rictbok, rhebok, rovibok, blauwbok, 
&c). In the Vryheid district the kudu, blue wildebeest, waterbuck, 
reedbuck, impala, steinbok and klipspringer are also found. Several 
of these species are now preserved. Ant-eaters (Orycteropus capensis) , 
porcupines, weasels, squirrels, rock rabbits, hares and cane rats are 
common in different localities. Baboons (Cynocephalus porcarius) 
and monkeys of different kinds frequent the mountains and rocky 
kloofs and bush and timber lands. The birds of Natal 1 are of 
many species; some have beautiful plumage, but none of them, 
with the exception of the canary, are to be considered as songsters. 
Among the larger birds are cranes, herons, the ibis, storks, eagles, 
vultures, falcons, hawks, kites, owls, the secretary birds, pelicans, 
flamingoes, wild duck and geese, gulls, and of game birds, the paauw, 
koraan, pheasant, partridge, guinea fowl and quail. The other birds 
include parrots, toucans, gaudily coloured cuckoos, lories, swallows, 
shrikes, sun-birds, kingfishers, weavers, finches, wild pigeons and 
crows. The otter is found in some of the rivers, which are also fre- 
quented, near their mouths, by turtles. These last are also found 
in the coast lagoons and sometimes are of great size. Iguanas, 4 and 
5 ft. long, are found on the wooded banks of the rivers; small 
lizards and chameleons are common, and there are several varieties 
oftortoise. 

Of snakes there are about forty distinct species or varieties. 
The most dreaded by the natives arc called *' tmamba,' 1 of which 
there are at least eight different kinds; these snakes elevate and 
throw themselves forward, and have been known to pursue a horse- 
man. One sortof imamba, named by the natives indhlondhlo" 
is crested, and its body is of a bright flame colour. The sluggish 

Euff -adder (Clotho arietans) is common and very dangerous. A 
ooded snake (Naja haemachates), the intfezi of the natives, is 
dangerous, and spits or ejects its poison; besides this there are a 
few other varieties of the cobra species. The largest of the serpent 
tribe, however, is^ the python (Hortulia natalensis), called inhlwati 
by the natives^ its usual haunts are by streams amongst rocky 
boulders and in jungles, and instances are recorded of its strangling

and crushing adult natives. It is common in the coast districts, 
and is sometimes 20 ft. long. Insects abound in great numbers, 
the most troublesome and destructive being the tick {Ixodes natal- 
ensis), which infests the pasturage, and the white ant (Termes 
tnordax). Occasionally vast armies of locusts or caterpillars advance 
over large tracts of country, devouring all vegetation in their line 
of march. The fish moth, a steel-grey slimy active fish -shaped 
insect, is found in every house and is very destructive. Fish of 
excellent quality and in great quantities abound on the coast. They 
include shad, rock cod, mackerel, mullet, bream and soles; sharks, 
stingrays, cuttlefish and the octopus are also common in the waters 
off the coast of Natal. Prawns, crayfish and oysters are also ob- 
tainable, and turtle (Chelonia mydas) are frequently captured. 
Freshwater scale-fish are mostly full of bones, but fine eels and 
barbel arc plentiful in the rivers. Trout have been introduced into 
some of the higher reaches of the rivers. 

Inhabitants. — At the census of 1904 the population of the 
province, including Zululand, was i,io8,754. 2 Of this total 
&'&%, or 97>i°9, ^ere Europeans, 9%, or 100,918, Asiatics and 
the rest natives of South Africa, mainly of Zulu-Kaffir stock. 
Of the 824,063 natives, 203,373 lived in Zululand. The white and 
Asiatic population nearly doubled in the thirteen years since 
the previous census, allowance being made for the Utrecht and 
Vryheid districts, which in 1891 formed part of the Transvaal. 
Of the total population 985,167 live in rural areas, the average 
density for the whole country being 31-34 per sq. m. The 
white population is divided into 56,758 males and 40,351 females. 
Of the white inhabitants the great majority are British. Some 
12,500 are of Dutch extraction; these live chiefly in the districts 
of Utrecht and Vryheid. There are also about 4500 Natalians of 
German extraction, settled mainly in the New Hanover and 
Umzimkulu districts. The Asiatics at the 1904 census were 
divided into 63,497 rnales and 37,421 females. They include a 
few high caste Indians, Arabs and Chinese, but the great majority 
are Indian coolies. The Asiatics are mainly congregated in the 
coast districts between the Umzimkulu and Tugela rivers. 
In this region (which includes Durban) the Asiatic population 
was 61,854. In none of the inland districts did the Asiatic 
inhabitants number 2000. The coolies are employed chiefly on 
the sugar, coffee, cotton and other plantations, a small proportion 
being employed in the coal-mines. 

The native inhabitants of Natal proper were almost exter- 
minated by the Zulus in the early years of the 19th century. 
Before that period the natives of what is now Natal proper were 
estimated to number about 100,000. In 1838 when the Zulu 
power was first checked the natives had been reduced to about 
10,000. The stoppage of intertribal wars by the British, aided 
by a great influx of refugees from Zululand, led to a rapid increase 
of the population. With the exception of a few Bushmen, 
who cling to the slopes of the Drakensberg, all the natives are of 
Bantu stock. Before the Zulu devastations the natives belonged 
to the Ama-Xosa branch of the Kaffirs and are said to have been 
divided into ninety-four different tribes; to-day all the tribes 
have a large admixture of Zulu blood (see Kaffirs, Zululand 
and Bantu Languages). The Natal natives have preserved 
their tribal organization to a considerable extent. Nearly 50% 
live in special reserves or locations, the area set apart for native 
occupation being about 4000 sq. m. exclusive of Zululand. 
Most of the remainder are employed on or live upon farms owned 
by whites, paying annual rents of from £1 to £$ or more. There 
were, however, in 1904, 69,746 male natives and 10,232 female 
natives in domestic service. Of the tribes who were in Natal 
before the Zulu invasion about 181 2, the two largest are the 
Abatembu (who are in five main divisions and number about 
30,000) and the Amakwabe (seven divisions and about 20,000 
people). Other large tribes are the Amanyuswa (ten divisions — 
38,000 people), the Amakunu (three divisions — 26,000 people), 
and the Amabomvu (five divisions — 25,000 people). The three 
last tribes are among those which sought refuge in Natal from 
Zulu persecution, before the establishment of British rule in 
1843. The number of half-castes is remarkably small, at the 
census of 1904 the number of " mixed and others," which

includes Griquas and Hottentots and non-aboriginal negroes, 
was only 6686. 

Chief Towns. — The seat of the provincial government is Pietcr- 
maritzburg (q.v.), commonly called Maritzbur^ (or P.M.B.), with a 
population (1904) of 31,199. It is 71 m. by rail N.N.W. of Durban 
(q.v.)> the seaport and only large city in Natal, pop. 67,842. Lady- 
smith (q.v.), pop. 5568, ranks next in size. It is in the north-west 
of the province, is famous for its investment by the Boers in 1899- 
1900 and is an important railway junction. North-east of Lady- 
smith are Dundee (281 1) and Newcastle (2950). Dundee is the centre 
of the coal-mining district. Newcastle is also a mining town, but 
depends chiefly on its large trade in wool. It is named after the 
duke of Newcastle who was secretary for the colonies in 1852 and 
1859. Vryheid (2287) is in the centre of a highly mineralized 
district. Utrecht (860) lies between Newcastle and Vryheid, and 
was one of the first towns founded by the Transvaal Boers. - There 
are coal-mines on the town lands. Greytown (2436), a wool and 
wattle trading centre, is in central Natal. Verulam (1325), 19 m. 
along the coast north of Durban, serves as centre for sugar, tobacco 
and fruit plantations. It was founded by emigrants from St Albans, 
England — whence the name. Port Shcpstone, at the mouth of the 
Umzimkulu river, is the natural outlet for south-west Natal. Est- 
court is a trading centre, 75 m. by rail N.N.W. of Pietermaritzburg 
and is 29 m. distant from the village of Weenen (" Weeping "), so 
named by the first Boer settlers in memory of a Zulu raid. Another 
village, Colcnso, on the south bank of the Tugela, 16 m. by rail 
south of Ladysmith, was the headquarters of Sir Redvers Buller 
at the battle of Colenso on the 15th of December 1899. 

Communications. — Durban (Port Natal) is in regular communica- 
tion with Europe via Cape Town and via Suez by several lines of 
steamers, the chief being the boats of the Union-Castle line, which 
sail from Southampton and follow the west coast route, those of 
the German East Africa line, which sail from Hamburg and go via 
the east coast route and those of the Austrian Lloyd from Trieste, 
also by the east coast route. By the Union-Castle boats there is a 
weekly mail service to England. There are also two direct lines of 
steamers between London and Durban (a distance of 6993 nautical 
miles), average passage about twenty-six days; the mail route taking 
twenty to twenty-two days. Durban is also in regular and frequent 
communication by passenger steamers with the other South African 
ports, as well as Mauritius, Zanzibar, &c, and with India, Australia, 
the United States and South America. The works which have made 
Port Natal the finest harbour in South Africa are described under 
Durban. 

The first railway built in South Africa was a 2-m. line from 
The Point (or harbour) to the town of Durban. It was opened for 
traffic in i860 and in 1874 was extended some 4 m. to the Umgeni 
river. This line was of 4 ft. 8? in. gauge and was^ privately owned, 
but, when in 1876 the Natal government determined to build and 
own a railway system which should in time cover the country, the 
existing line was bought out and the gauge altered to 3 ft. 6 in. 
On this, the normal South African gauge, all the Natal railways, 
save a few 2-ft. branch lines, are built. t The main line starts from 
Durban, and passing through Pietermaritzburg (71 m.), Ladysmith 
(190 m.) and Newcastle (268 m.) pierces the Drakensberg at Laing's 
Nek by a tunnel 2213 ft. long, and 3 m. beyond Charlestown reaches 
the Transvaal frontier at mile 307. Thence the railway is continued 
to Johannesburg, &c. The distances from Durban to the places 
mentioned by this route are: Johannesburg, 483 m.; Pretoria 
511 m.; Kimberley, 793 m.; Bulawayo, 1508 m.; Delagoa Bay, 
860 m. 

From Ladysmith a branch line runs north-west into the Orange 
Free State, crossing the Drakensberg at Van Reenen's Pass. This 
line is continued via Harrismith and Bethlehem to Kroonstad 
(393 m « from Durban) on the main Cape Town, Bloemfontein and 
Johannesburg railway and is the shortest route between Durban 
and Cape Town (1271 m.). It also affords via Bloemfontein the 
shortest route (622 m.) between Durban and Kimberley. From 
Glencoe Junction, 42 m. north of Ladysmith on the direct line to 
Johannesburg, a branch railway goes N.E. to the Dundee coal- 
fields, Vryheid (59 m.) and Hlobane (76 m.). Two lines branch off 
from Pietermaritzburg. One (62 m. long) goes N.E. to Greytown, 
serving the east-central part of the province; the other line (108 m. 
long) goes S.W. to Riverside Station, forming a link in the scheme 
for direct communication between Natal and East London and Port 
Elizabeth. 

Durban is the starting-point of two coast lines. The south coast 
line, which runs close to the sea, goes to Port Shepstone (79 m.). 
A 2-ft. gauge railway (102 m.), which leaves the south coast line at 
Alexandra Junction* (44 m. from Durban), runs N.W. by Stuarts- 
town and joins the Pietermaritzbur^-Riverside line. The north coast 
railway (167 m. long) crosses the Tugela 70 m. from Durban and 
continued through Zululand to Somkcle, the centre of the Santa 
Lucia coal-fields. 

As might be expected in a country possessing the physical features 
of Natal, the gradients and curves are exceptionally severe. Not 
less than 43 m. are upon grades of 1 in 30 and 1 in 35, and curves of 
300 to 350 ft. radius, while on over 100 m. more there are grades 
under 1 in 60 and curves of less than 450 ft. radius. The main trunk 



line reaches an altitude of 3054 ft. at a point 58 m. distant from 
Durban; after falling 1000 ft. in its farther progress to Pieter- 
maritzburg, it again rises, 12 m. after leaving that city, to a height 
of 3700 ft. above the sea; at a point 134 m. from Durban it has 
reached an altitude of 5152 ft., but on reaching Ladysmith, 191 m. 
from Durban, the altitude has decreased to 3284 ft. The summit 
of the Biggarsbcrg chain is crossed at a point 233 m. from the port, 
at a height of 4800 ft., and at Laing's Nek the altitude is 5399 ft. 
The Orange Free State line, after leaving Ladysmith, ascends by 
steep gradients the whole of its own course in Natal territory, and 
when it gains the summit at Van Reenen's Pass it is 5500 ft. above 
the sea. The mileage open in 1910 was 1173. The cost of construc- 
tion, to the same year, exceeded £14,000,000, the interest earned per 
cent since 1895 not being less than £3, 12s. in any one year. In out- 
lying districts post carts and ox wagons are the usual means of con- 
veyance. There are about 5000 m. of high roads kept in repair by 
the government. 

There is a well-organized postal and telegraphic service. Land 
lines connect Natal with every part of South Africa and with Nyasa- 
land and Ujiji. A submarine cable from Durban goes to Zanzibar 
and Aden, whence there is communication with every quarter of the 
globe. The first telegraph line in Natal was opened in 1873; * n 
1878 communication was established with Cape Town and in the 
following year with Delagoa Bay. 

Agriculture and Allied Industries. — The diversity of soil and climate 
leads to a great diversity in the agricultural produce. The chief 
drawback to farming in the midland and upper districts is the con- 
siderable proportion of stony ground, and, in some cases, the lack 
of running water. The area of land under tillage is less than a 
twentieth of the whole surface, the crop most extensively grown 
being maize or " mealies." This is universally grown by the natives 
and forms their staple food; it is also grown by the Indians, and 
by the white farmers for export. Besides maize the crops cultivated 
by the natives are Kaffir corn or amabele (Sorghum caffrorum) — 
used in the manufacture of utyuala, native beer — imfi {Sorghum 
saccharatum) f tobacco, pumpkins and sweet potatoes. The chief 
wealth of the natives consists, however, in their large herds of cattle 
(see infra). While maize thrives in every part of the country, 
wheat, barley and oats — cultivated by the white farmers — flourish 
only in the midlands and uplands. More important than the cereal 
crops are the tropical and sub-tropical products of the coast zone. 
Besides fruits of nearly all kinds there are cultivated in the low 
moist regions the sugar-cane, the tea, coffee and tobacco plants, 
arrowroot, cayenne pepper, cotton, &c. The area under sugar in 
1905 was 45,840 acres and the produce 532,067 cwt. (a large quantity 
of sugar-cane is grown for feeding stock). In the same year the 
production of tea was 1,633,178ft); of coffee, 24,859ft); of maize, 
2,101,470 bushels; of potatoes, 419,946 bushels; and of sweet 
potatoes, 181,195 bushels. The tea plant was first introduced in 
Natal in 1850, but little attention was paid to it until the failure of 
the coffee plantations about 1875, since when only small quantities 
of coffee have been produced. In 1877 renewed efforts were made 
to induce tea cultivation, and by 1881 it had become an established 
industry. The variety chiefly grown is the Assam indigenous. 
Most of the tea estates are situated in the coast belt north of Durban. 
The sugar cane, like tea, was first introduced in 1850, the first canes 
being brought from Mauritius. The industry is steadily growing, 
as arc the dependent manufactures of molasses and rum. The fruit 
industry is of considerable importance and by 1905 had reached a 
turnover of over £100,000 a year. 

Extensive areas in the midland and upland districts are devoted 
to the raising of stock. Horse-breeding is successfully carried on 
in the upper districts. The higher the altitude the healthier the 
animals and the greater their immunity from disease. Horse- 
sickness, a kind of malarial fever, which takes an epidemic form in 
very wet seasons, causes considerable loss. The Natal horse is small, 
wiry, and has great powers of endurance. Cattle-breeding is probably 
the most lucrative branch of stock-farming, the country being 
pre-eminently adapted for horned cattle. Rinderpest in 1 896-1 897 
swept through South Africa, and probably carried off in Natal from 
30 to 40 % of the stock of Europeans, while the natives' losses were 
even heavier. Serum and bile inoculation were the means of saving 
a considerable percentage of the herds. The farmers soon began to 
recover from their losses, but in 1908-1909 another serious loss of 
stock resulted from the ravages of East Coast fever. The cattle 
consist chiefly of the Zulu and Africander breeds, but attention 
has been given to improving the breed by the introduction of Short- 
horn, Devon and Holstein (or Friesland) stock. The chief market 
for cattle is Johannesburg. The principal breed of sheep is the 
merino, which does well in the higher altitudes. A Scab Act is in 
force, and is stringently carried out by government inspectors 
with most satisfactory results. The Angora goat thrives well in 
certain districts. Ostriches do well in the dry, arid valleys of the 
Tugela and Mooi rivers. In 1908 Europeans were returned as 
owning 32,000 horses, 220,000 horned cattle, 765,000 sheep, 68,000 
goats, 25,000 pigs, 960 ostriches and 384,000 poultry. Large herds 
of cattle — over 500,000 in the aggregate — are owned by the 
natives, who also possess vast flocks of goats and sheep. The 
dairy industry is well established, and Natal butter commands a- 
I ready sale.

Valuable timber is obtained from the forests. Stinkwood is 
largely employed in the making of wagons, and isalso used for making 
furniture. Black ironwood is likewise used in building wagons, 
while sneezewood is largely utilized for supports for piers and other 
marine structures, being impervious to the attacks of the Teredo 
navalis. More important is the cultivation of the black" wattle 
(Acacia mollissima), which began in 1886, the bark being exported for 
tanning purposes, the wood also commanding a ready sale. This 
wattle thrives well in most localities, but especially in the highlands 
of central Natal. In 1905 the production of wattle bark was 13,620 
tons, and the area planted with the tree over 60,000 acres. Aloes 
and ramie are cultivated to some extent for their fibre. 

The government maintains experimental farms and forestry 
plantations and a veterinary department tocope with lung sickness, 
rinderpest, East Coast fever and such like diseases. It also conducts 
campaigns against locusts and other pests and helps irrigation 
settlements. By means of an Agricultural Bank it affords assistance 
to farmers. 

Mining. — There are several highly mineralized areas in the 
country. The existence of coal in the north-east districts on or near 
the surface of the ground was reported as early as 1839, but it was 
not until 1880 that steps were taken to examine the coalfields. 
This was done by F. W. North, who reported in 1881 that in the 
Klip river (Dundee) district there was an area of 1350 sq. m. that 
might be depended upon for the supply of coal, which is of all 
characters from lignite to anthracite. In 1889 the extension of the 
railway from Ladysmith through the coal area, first made coal- 
mining profitable. In 1896 the total output of coal was 216,106 
tons (valued at £108,053 at tne pit's mouth), in 1908 it had increased 
to 1,669,774 tons (valued at the pit's mouth at £737,169). There is a 
considerable trade in bunker and export coal at Durban, the coal 
bunkered having increased from 118,740 tons in 1900 to 710,777 in 
1.908. In the last-named year 446,915 tons of coal were exported. 
Besides the mines in the Newcastle and Dundee district there are 
extensive coal-fields at Hlobane in the Vryheid district and in Zulu- 
land (q.v.). Iron ore is widely distributed and is found in the neigh- 
bourhood of all the coal-fields. There are extensive copperand gold- 
yielding areas, and in some districts these metals are mined. On 
the lower Umzimkulu, near Port Shepstone, marble is found in great 
quantities. 

Commerce. — The chief exports, not all products of the province, 
are coal, wool, mohair, hides and skins, wattle bark, tea, sugar, 
fruits and jams. The import trade is of a most varied character, 
and a large proportion of the goods brought into the country are in 
transit to the Transvaal and Orange Free State, Natal affording, next 
to Delagoa Bay, the shortest route to the Rand. Textiles, largely 
cotton goods, hardware, mining and agricultural machinery, tobacco 
and foodstuffs form the bulk of the imports. In 1896 the value 
of exports was £1,785,000; in 1908 the value was £9,622,000. In 
1896 the imports were valued at £5,437.000, in 1908 at £8,330,000 
(a decrease of £2,300,000 compared with^ 1905). _ The bulk of these 
exports are to the Transvaal and neighbouring countries, and 
previously figure as imports, other exports, largely wool and hides, 
are first imported from the Transvaal. Over three-fifths of the 
imports are from Great Britain, and about one-seventh of the 
exports go to Great Britain. The shipping, which in 1874 was 
126,000 tons, was in 1884 1,013,000; in 1894, 1, 463^000; in 1904 
4,263,000; and in 1908, 5,028,000. Over six-sevenths of the shipping 
is British. 

Government and Constitution. — Natal was from 1893 to 1910 
a self-governing colony. It is now represented in the Union 
Parliament by eight senators and seventeen members of the 
House of Assembly. The qualifications for electors and members 
of the Assembly are the same, namely men of full age owning 
houses or land worth £50, or who rent sucb property of the yearly 
value of £10; or who, having lived three years in the province, 
have incomes of not less than £96 a year. 

Coloured persons are not, by name, excluded from the franchise, 
but no persons " subject to special laws and tribunals," x in which 
category all natives are included, are entitled to vote. Another 
law, 2 directed against Indians, excludes from the franchise, 
natives, or descendants of natives in the male line, of countries 
not possessing elective representative institutions. Exemption 
from the scope of these provisions may be granted by the 
governor-general and under such exemption a few Kaffirs are 
on the roll of electors. 

At the head of the provincial government is an administrator, 
appointed by the Union Ministry, who holds office for five 
years. He is assisted by an executive committee of four members 
elected by the provincial council. This council to which is 

1 Act No. 2 (of the Natal Legislature) of 1883. 

1 Act No. 8 of 1896. The Indians whose names were " rightly 
contained " in the voters' rolls at the date of the act retain the 
franchise. 



entrusted the management of affairs purely provincial consists 
of 25 members, elected by the parliamentary voters and each 
representing a separate constituency. The council sits for a 
statutory period of three years. For local government purposes 
the province is divided into counties or magisterial divisions; 
Zululand being under special jurisdiction. The chief towns — 
Durban, Maritzburg, Ladysmith, Newcastle and Dundee — are 
governed by municipal corporations and minor towns by local 
boards. 

Revenue and Expenditure. — Revenue is derived chiefly from 
customs and excise, railways, land sales, posts and telegraphs and a 
capitation tax. The expenditure is largely on reproductive works 
(railways, harbours, post office, &c), on the judiciary and police, 
education and military defence. _ The majority of these services are, 
since 1910, managed by the Union Government, but the provincial 
council has power to levy direct taxation, and (with the consent 
of the Union Government) to raise loans for purely provincial 
purposes. Its revenues and powers are those pertaining to local 
government. Some particulars follow as to the financial position of 
Natal previous to the establishment of the Union. 

In 1846, the first year of Natal's separate existence, the revenue 
was £3073 and the expenditure £6905. In 1852 the revenue was 
£27,158 and the expenditure £24,296, and in 1862 the conesponding 
figures were £98,799 and £85,928. In 1872 revenue had risen to 
£180,499 and expenditure to £132,978. Ten years later the figures 
were, revenue £657,738, expenditure £659,031. The rise of Johannes- 
burg and the opening up of the Dundee coal-fields, as well as the 
development. of agriculture, now caused a rapid increase on both 
sides of the account. In 1888 the revenue for the first time exceeded 
a million, the figures for that year being, revenue £1,130,614, ex- 
penditure £781,326; in 1 898-1 899 the figures were £2,081,349 and 
£1,914,725. The Anglo-Boer War (1 899-1902) caused both revenue 
and expenditure to rise abnormally, while the depression in trade 
which followed the war adversely affected the exchequer. In 1903- 
1904 there was a slight credit balance, the figures being, revenue 
£4,160,145, expenditure £4,071,439. For the next four years 
there were deficits, but in 19081-1909 a surplus was realized, the 
revenue being £3,569,275 and the expenditure £3,530,576. For 
1909-19 10, the last year of Natal's existence as a colony, the revenue, 
£4,035,000, again exceeded the expenditure. The public debt, 
£2,101,500 in 1882, had risen at the close of the Boer War in 1902 
to £12,519,000, and was in June 1909, £21,420,000. 

Defence. — A small garrison of imperial troops is quartered at 
Maritzburg. The provincial force consists of a militia, fully equipped 
and armed with modern weapons. It is divided into mounted rifle- 
men, about 1900 strong, four field batteries of 3^0 men and two 
infantry battalions, each of over 800 men. There is also an armed 
and mounted police force of 870 Europeans. Military training is 
compulsory on all lads over ten attending government schools. 
The boys are organized in cadet corps. A senior cadet corps is 
formed of youths between sixteen and twenty. There are also many 
rifle associations, the members of which are liable to be called out 
for defence. Durban harbour is defended by batteries with heavy 
modern guns. The batteries are manned by the naval corps (150 
strong) of the Natal militia. Natal makes an annual contribution of 
£35iOOO towards the upkeep of the British navy. 

Law and Justice. — The South Africa Act 1909 established a 
Supreme Court of South Africa, the former supreme court of Natal 
becoming a provincial division of the new supreme court. The 
Roman-Dutcn law, as accepted and administered by the courts of 
Cape Colony up to 1845 (the date of the separation of Natal from the 
Cape), is the law of the land, save as modified by ordinances and 
laws enacted by the local legislature, mostly founded upon imperial 
statute law. The law of evidence is the same as that of the courts 
of England. Natives, however, are not justiceable under the Roman- 
Dutch law, but by virtue of letters patent passed in 1848 they are 
judged by native laws and customs, except so far as these may be 
repugnant to natural equity. The native laws were first codified in 
1878, in 1887 a board was appointed for their revision, and the new 
code came into operation in 1901. Provision is made whereby a 
native can obtain relief from the operation of native^ law and be 
subject to the colonial law (Law No. 28 of 1865). Special laws have 
been passed for the benefit of the coolie immigrants. The ad- 
ministration of justice is conducted by magistrates' courts, circuit 
courts and the provincial division of the supreme court. The magi- 
strates have both civil and criminal jurisdiction in minor cases. 
Appeals can be made from the magistrates* decisions to the pro- 
vincial or circuit court.^ The provincial court, consisting of a judge 
president and three puisne judges, sits in Pietermaritzburg and has 
mrisdiction over all causes whether affecting natives or Europeans. 
The judges also hold circuit courts at Durban and other places. 
Appeals from the circuit courts can be made to the provincial court; 
and from the provincial court appeals lie to the appellate division 
of the Supreme Court of South Africa, sitting at Bloemfontein. 
Criminal cases are tried before a single judge and a jury of nine — 
of whom not fewer than seven determine the verdict. There is a 
vice-admiralty court, of which the judge-president is judge and 



NATAL 



257 



commissary. In native cases the chiefs have civil jurisdiction in 
disputes among their own tribesmen and criminal jurisdiction over 
natives except in capital cases, offences against the person or 
property of non-natives, pretended witchcraft, cases arising out of 
marriages by Christian rites, &c. An appeal lies to a magistrates' 
court from every judgment of a native chief, and from the magis- 
trates' judgment on such appeal to a native high court. This native 
high court consists of a judge-president and two other judges, and sits 
in full court at Maritzburg not less than three months and at Eshowe 
not less than once in the year. There is no jury in this tribunal 
and single judges may hold circuit courts. _ With certain exceptions 
reserved for the provincial court (such as insolvency, ownership of 
immovable property and divorce), the native high court exercises 
jurisdiction when all parties to the suit are natives; it also has 
jurisdiction when the complainant is not a native, but all other 
parties to the suit are natives. 

Religion. — The majority of the white inhabitants are Protestants, 
the bodies with the largest number of adherents being the Anglicans, 
Dutch Reformed Church, Presbyterians and Wesleyans. The 
Anglicans are divided into two parties — those belonging to " the 
Church of the Province of South Africa," the body in communion 
with the Church of England, and those who act independently and 
constitute " the Church of England in Natal/* The schism arose 
out of the alleged heterodox views of Bishop Colenso (<?.».), who had 
been created bishop of Natal by letters patent in 1853. In 1863 
the metropolitan of Cape Town, as head of the Church of the Province 
of South Africa, excommunicated Dr Colenso and consecrated a rival 
bishop for Natal, who took the title of bishop of Pietermaritzburg. 
Dr Colenso, who obtained a decision of the privy council confirming 
his claim to be bishop of Natal and possessor of the temporalities 
attached to the bishopric, died in 1883, After his death those 
members of the Anglican community who objected to the constitu- 
tion of the provincial church maintained their organization while the 
temporalities were placed in the hands of curators. Reunion in 
spiritual matters has, however, been practically effected. Moreover, 
an act of the Natal parliament passed in 1909 placed the temporalities 
into commission in the persons of the bishop and other trustees of 
the Natal diocese of the Provincial Church ; reservations being made 
in favour of four congregations at that time unwilling to unite with 
the main body of churchmen. 1 At the census of 1904 the Anglicans 
numbered 40,880, The Presbyterians numbered 12,184, the Wes- 
Icyan Methodists 11,992, the Dutch Reformed Church 11,340, the 
Lutherans 4852, and the Baptists 2193. The Roman Catholics, at 
whose head is a vicar-apostolic, numbered 10,419. All these figures 
are exclusive of natives, of whom the churches named — notably the 
-Anglicans and Wesleyans — have many converts. The Jewish com- 
munity in 1904 numbered 1496. Of the Asiatics, 87,234 were classed 
as Hindus and 10,111 as Mahommedans. 

Education. — Education other than elementary is controlled by the 
Union government. Public schools, and private schools aided by 
provincial grants provide elementary education for white children. 
Education is neither compulsory nor free; but the fees are low 
(is. to 5s. a month) and few children are kept away from school. 
There are government secondary and art schools at Durban and 
Maritzburg, and a Technical Institute at Durban. For higher edu- 
cation provision was made by the affiliation of Natal to the Cape of 
Good Hope University and by exhibitions tenable at English universi- 
ties. An act of the Natal legislature, passed December 1909, provided 
for the establishment at Maritzburg of the Natal University College, 
the course of studies to be such as from time to time prescribed by 
the Cape University. In 1910 £30,000 was voted for the University 
College buildings. State aid and inspection is given to private 
schools for natives. In the native schools — almost all maintained by 
Christian missions — Zulu and English are taught, the subjects taken 
being usually reading, writing, arithmetic, grammar, geography 
and history. The state provides elementary and higher grade 
schools for Indian children. In 1908 there were 52 government 
schools and 472 schools under inspection; 304 European, 21 coloured, 
168 native and 31 Indian, with an aggregate attendance of 30,598 
scholars. There are in addition many private and denominational 
schools and colleges not receiving state aid. Of these, two of the 
best known are Hilton College and Hermansberg College, many 
prominent Natalians having been educated at one or the other of 
these establishments. To encourage the instruction of children 
who by reason of distance^ cannot attend a government or govern- 
ment-aided school, grants-in-aid are made for each pupil attending 
farm schools. 

The Press. — The first newspaper in Natal was the Natalier, a 
Dutch print published at Maritzburg; it was succeeded by the 
Patriot. The first English paper was the Natal Witness, started in 
1845 and still one of the leading organs of public opinion. In 1851 
the Natal Times appeared, and is now continued as the Times of 
Natal. Another leading paper, the Natal Mercury, dates from 1852. 
It is a morning newspaper and is issued at Durban. The Natal 
Advertizer is a Durban evening paper. Sir John Robinson, the first 
premier of Natal under responsible government, was the editor of 
the Mercury from i860 until he became prime minister in 1893.

(London March 11, 1910).

In 1886 a new Dutch paper, De Afrikaner, was started at Maritzburg. 
The Kaffirs have their own organ, Ipipa lo Hlunga (the paper of 
grievances), issued at Maritzburg, and the Asiatics, Indian Opinion, 
a weekly paper started in 1903 and printed in English, Gujarati, 
Hindi and Tamil. Local papers are published weekly at Ladysmith, 
Dundee and Greytown. The Agricultural Journal, a government 
publication issued fortnightly, is of great service in the promotion of 
agricultural knowledge. 

History. 

Vasco da Gama on his voyage to India sighted the bluff at 
the entrance to the bay now forming the harbour of Durban 
on Christmas Day 1497 and named the country Terra 
Natalis, Da Gama made no landing here and, like Discover y 
the rest of South Africa, Natal was neglected by the Jtetom^ 
Portuguese, whose nearest settlement was at Delagoa 
Bay. In 1576 Manuel de Mesquita Perestrellp, commanded by 
King Sebastian to explore the coast of South Africa and report 
on suitable harbours, made a rough chart, even then of little use 
to navigators, which is of value as exhibiting the most that was 
known of the country by its discoverers before the advent of their 
Dutch rivals, who established themselves at Cape Town in 1652. 
Perestrello states that Natal has no ports but otherwise he gives 
a fairly accurate description of the country — noting particu- 
larly the abundance of animals and the density of the population. 
The first detailed accounts of the country were received from 
shipwrecked mariners. In 1683 the English ship " Johanna " 
went ashore near Delagoa Bay and the crew made a remarkable 
journey overland to Cape Town, passing through Natal, where 
they were kindly received by the natives. About the same time 
(in 1684) an English ship put into Port Natal (as the bay came 
to be known) and purchased ivory from the natives, who, how- 
ever, refused to deal in slaves. In May 1685 another English 
ship the " Good Hope " was wrecked in crossing the bar at Port 
Natal and in February 1686 the " Stavenisse," a Dutch East 
Indiaman, was wrecked a little farther south. Survivors of 
both vessels lived for nearly a year at Port Natal and there built 
a boat in which they made the voyage to Cape Town in twelve 
days. They brought with them 3 tons of ivory. This fact 
and their reports of the immense herds of elephants which roamed 
the hush led Simon van der Stell, then governor at Cape Town, 
to despatch (1689) the ship " Noord " to Port Natal, with instruc- 
tions to her commander to open up a trade in ivory and to acquire 
possession of the bay. From the chief of the Amatuli tribe, 
who inhabited the adjacent district, the bay was " purchased " 
for about £50 worth of goods. No settlement was then made 
and in 1705 the son of the chief repudiated the bargain. In 
1 721 the Cape government did form a settlement at the bay, 
but it was soon afterwards abandoned. Thereafter for nearly 
a hundred years" Natal was again neglected by white men. 
A ship now and again put into the bay, but the dangerous bar 
at its entrance militated against its frequent use. When in 
1824 the next attempt was made by Europeans to form a settle- 
ment at the bay, Cape Colony had passed from the Dutch 
into the possession of Great Britain, while in Natal great 
changes had come over the land as a result of wars between the 
natives. 

From the records of the 17th and 18th centuries it is apparent 
that the people then inhabiting Natal were Bantu-negroes of 
the Kaffir (Ama Xosa) branch. There is no mention of Hotten- 
tots, and the few Bushmen who dwelt in the upper regions by the 
Drakensberg did not come into contact with Europeans. The 
sailors of the " Stavenisse " reported the most numerous and 
most powerful tribe to be the Abambo, while that which came 
most in contact with the whites was the Amatuli, as it occupied 
a considerable part of the coast-land. These Kaffirs appear to 
have been more given to agriculture and more peaceful than 
their neighbours in Kaffraria and Cape Colony, But the quiet of 
the country was destroyed by the inroads of Chaka, the chief of 
the Zulus (see Zululand). Chaka between 1818 and 1820 
ravaged the whole of what is now known as Natal, and after 
beating his foes in battle, butchered the women, children and 
old men, incorporating the young men in his impis. The popula- 
tion was greatly reduced and large areas left without a single 



2 5 8 



NATAL 



inhabitant. By right of conquest Chaka became undisputed 
master of the country. 

Such was the situation when the first British settlement was 
made in Natal. In 1823 Francis George Farewell, formerly a 
lieutenant in the British navy, with other merchants of Cape 
Town, formed a company to trade with the natives of the south- 
east coast. In the brig " Salisbury," commanded by James S. 
King, who had been a midshipman in the navy, Farewell visited 
Port Natal, St Lucia and Delagoa Bays. The voyage was not 
successful as a trading venture, but Farewell was so impressed 
with the possibilities of Natal both for trade and colonization that 
he resolved to establish himself at the port. He went thither with 
ten companions, among them Henry Francis Fynn. All the rest 
save Farewell and Fynn speedily repented of their adventure and 
returned to the Cape, but the two who remained were joined by 
three sailors, John Cane, Henry Ogle and Thomas Holstead, a 
lad. Farewell, Fynn and the others went to the royal kraal of 
Chaka, and, having cured him of a wound and made him various 
presents, obtained a document, dated the 7th of August 1824, 
ceding to " F. G. Farewell & Company entire and full possession 
in perpetuity " of a tract of land including " the port or harbour 
of Natal." On the 27th of the same month Farewell hoisted the 
The first Union Jack at the port and declared the territory he 
British had acquired a British possession. In 1825 he was 
settle' joined by King, who had meantime visited England 
meaU and had obtained from the government a letter of 
recommendation to Lord Charles Somerset, governor of the Cape, 
granting King permission to settle at Natal. Farewell, King and 
Fynn made independent settlements at various parts of the 
bay, where a few Amatuli stiD lingered. They lived, practically, 
as Kaffir chiefs, trading with Chaka and gathering round them 
many refugees from that monarch's tyranny. Early in 1828 
King, accompanied by two of Chaka's indunas, voyaged in the 
" Elizabeth and Susan," a small schooner built by the settlers, 
to Port Elizabeth. He appears to have been coldly received by 
the authorities, who were even unable to ascertain the nature of 
Chaka's embassy. Soon after his return to Natal King died, and 
in the same month (September 1828) Chaka was murdered by 
his brother Dingaan. In the December following Farewell went 
in the " Elizabeth and Susan " to Port Elizabeth. On this 
occasion the authorities were more hostile than before to the 
Natal pioneers, for they confiscated the schooner on the ground 
that it was unregistered and that it came from a foreign port. 
Farewell was not daunted, and in September 1829 set out to 
return overland to Port Natal. He was, however, murdered in 
Pondoland by a chief who was at enmity with the Zulus. Fynn 
thus became leader of the whites at the port, who were much at 
the mercy of Dingaan. In 1831 that chief raided their settle- 
ments, the whites all fleeing south of the Umzimkulu; but at 
Dingaan's invitation they soon returned. Dingaan declared 
Fynn his representative and " great chief of the Natal Kaffirs." 
In 1834, however, Fynn accepted a post under the Cape govern- 
ment and did not return to Natal for many years. It was in this 
year that a petition from Cape Town merchants asking for the 
creation of a British colony at Natal was met by the statement 
that the Cape finances would not permit the establishment of 
a new dependency. The merchants, however, despatched an 
expedition under Dr Andrew Smith to inquire into the possibilities 
of the country, and the favourable nature of his report induced a 
party of Dutch farmers under Piet Uys to go thither also. Both 
Dr Smith and Uys travelled overland through Kaffraria, and 
were well received by the English living at the bay. The next 
step was taken by the settlers at the port, who in 1835 resolved 
to lay out a town, which they named Durban, after Sir Benjamin 
d'Urban, then governor of Cape Colony. At the same time the 
settlers, who numbered about 50, sent a memorial to the governor 
calling attention to the fact that they were acknowledged rulers 
over a large tract of territory south of the Tugela, and asking 
that this territory should be proclaimed a British colony under 
the name of Victoria and that a governor and council be appointed. 
To all these requests* no official answer was returned. The 
settlers had been joined in the year named (1835) by Captain 



voor* 
trekkers* 



Gardiner, a naval officer, whose chief object was the evangeliza- 
tion of the natives. With the support of the traders he founded 
a mission station on the hill overlooking the bay. In 1837 
Gardiner was given authority by the British government to 
exercise jurisdiction over the traders. They, however, refused 
to acknowledge Gardiner's authority, and from the Cape govern- 
ment he received no support. 1 It was not until their hand was 
forced by the occupation of the interior by Dutch farmers that 
the Cape authorities at length intervened. 

The British settlers had, characteristically, reached Natal 
mainly by way of the sea; the new tide of immigration was by 
land — the voortrekkers streamed through the passes of A H . 
the Drakensberg, bringing with them their wives and ofthe 
children and vast herds of cattle. The reasons which Dutch 
caused the exodus from the Cape are discussed else- 
where (see South Africa and Cape Colony), here it is 
only necessary to point out that those emigrants who entered 
Natal shared with those who settled elsewhere an intense desire 
to be free from British control. The first emigrant Boers to enter 
the country were led by Pieter Retief (c. 1 780-1838), a man of 
Huguenot descent and of marked ability, who had formerly lived 
on the eastern frontier of Cape Colony and had suffered severely 
in the Kaffir wars. Passing through the almost deserted upper 
regions Retief arrived at the bay in October 1837. He went 
thence to Dingaan's kraal with the object of securing a formal 
cession of territory to the Dutch farmers. Dingaan consented 
on condition that the Boers recovered for him certain cattle 
stolen by another chief; this task Retief accomplished, and with 
the help of the Rev. F. Owen, a missionary then living at 
Dingaan's kraal, a deed of cession was drawn up in English and 
signed by Dingaan and Retief on the 4th of February 1838. 
Two days after the signature of the deed Retief and all of his 
party, 66 whites, besides Hottentot servants, were treacherously 
murdered by Dingaan's orders. The Zulu king then commanded 
his impis to kill all the Boers who had entered Natal. The Zulu 
forces crossed the Tugela the same day, and the most advanced 
parties of the Boers were massacred, many at a spot near where 
the town of Weenen now stands, its name (meaning wailing or 
weeping) commemorating the event. Other of the farmers 
hastily laagered and were able to repulse the Zulu attacks; the 
assailants suffering serious loss at a fight near the Bushman's 
river. Nevertheless in one week after the murder of Retief 
600 Boers — men, women and children — had been killed by the 
Zulus. The English settlers at the bay, hearing of the attack on 
the Boers, determined to make a diversion in their favour, and 
some 20 men under the command of R. Biggar and with a 
following of 700 friendly Zulus crossed the Tugela near its mouth. 
In a desperate fight (April 17) with a strong force of the 
enemy the English were overwhelmed and only four Europeans 
escaped to the bay. Pursued by the Zulus, all the surviving 
inhabitants of Durban were compelled for a time to take refuge 
on a ship then in harbour. After the Zulus retired, less than a 
dozen Englishmen returned to live at the port; the missionaries, 
hunters and other traders returned to the Cape. Meantime the 
Boers, who had repelled the Zulu attacks on their laagers, had been 
joined by others from the Drakensberg, and about 400 men under 
Hendrik Potgieter and Piet Uys advanced to attack Dingaan. 
On the nth of April, however, they fell into a trap laid by the 
Zulus and with difficulty cut their way out. Among those slain 
were Piet Uys and his son Dirk, aged 15, who rode by his side. 
The Boer farmers were now in a miserable plight, but towards the 
end of the year they received reinforcements, and in December 
460 men set out under Andries Pretorius to avenge themselves 
on the Zulus. On Sunday the 16th of December, while laagered 
near the Umslatos river, they were attacked by over 10,000 
Zulus. The Boers had firearms, the Zulus their assegais only, 
and after a three hours' fight the Zulus were totally defeated, 
losing thousands killed, while the farmers' casualties were under

a dozen. (This memorable victory is annually commemorated 
by the Boers as Dingaan's Day, while the Umslatos, which ran 
red with the blood of the slain, was renamed Blood river.) 
Dingaan fied, the victorious Boers entered the royal kraal, gave 
decent burial to the skeletons of Retief and his party, and regarded 
themselves as now undisputed masters of Natal. They had 
recovered from a leather pouch which Retief carried the deed by 
which Dingaan ceded " to Retief and his countrymen the place 
called Port Natal together with all the lands annexed ... as 
far as the land may be useful and in my possession." This was 
the 5th or 6th cession made by Chaka or Dingaan of the same 
territory to different individuals. In every case the overlordship 
of the Zulus was assumed. 

Returning south, Pretorius and his commando were surprised 
to learn that Port Natal had been occupied on the 4th of December 
by a detachment of the 72nd Highlanders sent thither from the 
Cape. The emigrant farmers had, with the assent of the few 
remaining Englishmen at Port Natal, in May 1838 issued a 
proclamation taking possession of the port. This had been 
followed by an intimation from the governor of the Cape (Major- 
General Sir George Napier) inviting the emigrants to return to the 
colony, and stating that whenever he thought it desirable he 
should take military possession of the port. In sanctioning the 
occupation of the port the British government of the day had no 
intention of making Natal a British colony, but wished to prevent 
the Boers establishing an independent republic upon the coast 
with a harbour through which access to the interior could be 
gained. After remaining at the port just over a year the 
Highlanders were withdrawn, on Christmas Eve 1839. Mean- 
time the Boers had founded Pietermaritzburg and made it the 
seat of their volksraad. They rendered their power in Natal 
absolute, for the time, in the following month, when they joined 
with Panda, Dingaan 's brother, in another attack on the Zulu 
king. Dingaan was utterly defeated and soon afterwards 
perished, Panda becoming king in his stead by favour of the Boers. 

At this time, had the affairs of the Boer community been 
managed with prudence and sagacity they might have estab- 
lished an enduring state. But their impatience of control, 
reflected in the form of government adopted, led to disastrous 
consequences. Legislative power was vested, nominally, in the 
volksraad (consisting of twenty-four members), while the president 
and executive were changed every three months. But whenever 
any measure of importance was to be decided a meeting was 
called of het publiek, that is, of all who chose to attend, to 
sanction or reject it. " The result," says Theal, " was utter 
anarchy. Decisions of one day were frequently reversed the 
next, and every one held himself free to disobey any law that he 
did not approve of. . . . Public opinion of the hour in each 
section of the community was the only force in the land" 
(History of South Africa 1834-1854, chap. xliv.). While such 
was the domestic state of affairs during the period of self-govern- 
ment, the settlers cherished large territorial views. They were 
in loose alliance with and in quasi-supremacy over the Boer 
communities which had left the Cape and settled at Winburg 
and at Potchefstroom. They had declared themselves a free 
and independent state under the title of " The Republic of 
Port Natal and adjacent countries," 1 and sought (September 
1840) from Sir George Napier at the Cape an acknowledgment 
of their independence by Great Britain. Sir George, being 
without definite instructions from England, could give no decisive 
answer, but he was friendly disposed to the Natal farmers. 
This feeling was, however, changed by what Sir George (and many 
of the Dutch in Natal also) thought a wilful and unjustifiable 
attack (December 1840) on a tribe of Kaffirs on the southern, 
or Cape Colony, frontier by a commando under Andries Pretorius, 
which set out, nominally, to recover stolen cattle. Having 
at length received an intimation from London that the queen 
f could not acknowledge the independence of her own subjects, 
but that the trade of the emigrant farmers would be placed 
on the same footing as that of any other British settlement, 
upon their receiving a military force to exclude the interference 
1 Commonly called the Republic of Natalia or Natal. 



with or possession of the country by any other European power," 
Sir George communicated this decision to the volksraad in 
September 1841. Under the arrangement proposed the Boers 
might easily have secured the benefits of self-government, 
subject to an acknowledgment of British supremacy, together 
with the advantage of military protection, for the British govern- 
ment was then extremely reluctant to extend its colonial re- 
sponsibilities. The Boers, however, strongly resented the conten- 
tion of the British that they could not shake off British nationality 
though beyond the bounds of any recognized British possession, 
nor were they prepared to see their only port garrisoned by 
British troops, and they rejected Napier's overtures. Napier, 
therefore, on the 2nd of December 1841, issued a proclamation 
in which he stated that in consequence of the emigrant farmers 
refusing to be treated as British subjects and of their attitude 
towards the Kaffir tribes he intended resuming military occupation 
of Port Natal. This proclamation was answered in a lengthy 
minute, dated the 21st of February 1842, drawn up by J. N. 
Boshof (afterwards president of the Orange Free State), by far 
the ablest of the Dutch who had settled in Natal. In this minute 
the farmers ascribed all their troubles to one cause, British 
namely, the absence of a representative government, *«rf 
which had been repeatedly asked for by them while Dat ^J a 
still living in Cape Colony and as often denied or 
delayed, and concluded by a protest against the occupation 
of any part of their territory by British troops. An incident 
which happened immediately after these events greatly en- 
couraged the Boers to persist in their opposition to Great Britain. 
In March 1842 a Dutch vessel sent out by G. G. Ohrig, an 
Amsterdam merchant who sympathized warmly with the cause 
of the emigrant farmers, reached port Natal, and its supercargo, 
J. A. Smellekamp (a man who subsequently played a part in 
the early history of the Transvaal and Orange Free State), con- 
cluded a treaty with the volksraad assuring them of the pro- 
tection of Holland. The Natal Boers believed the Netherlands to 
be one of the great powers of Europe, and were firmly persuaded 
that its government would aid them in resisting England. 

On the 1st of April Captain T. C. Smith with a force of 263 men 
left his camp at the Umgazi,on the eastern frontier of Cape Colony, 
and marching overland reached Durban without opposition, and 
encamped, on the 4th of May, at the base of the Berea hills. 
The Boers, cut off from their port, called out a commando of some 
300 to 400 men under Andries Pretorius and gathered at Congella 
at the head of the bay. On the night of the 23rd of May Smith 
made an unsuccessful attack on the Boer camp, losing his guns 
and fifty men killed and wounded. On the 26th the Boers 
captured the harbour and settlement, and on the 31st blockaded 
the British camp, the women and children being removed, on the 
suggestion of Pretorius, to a ship in the harbour of which 'the 
Boers had taken possession. Meantime, an old Durban resident, 
Richard (commonly called Dick) King, had undertaken to convey 
tidings of the perilous position of the British force to the com- 
mandant at Graham's Town. He started on the night of the 
24th, and escaping the Boer outposts rode through the dense bush 
and across the bridgeless rivers of Kaffraria at peril of his life 
from hostile natives and wild beasts, and in nine days reached 
his destination — a distance of 360 m. in a direct line, and nearly 
600 by the route to be followed. This remarkable ride was 
accomplished with one change of mount, obtained from a mis- 
sionary in Pondoland. A comparatively strong force under 
Colonel A. J. Clocte was at once sent by sea to Port Natal, and on 
the 26th of June Captain Smith was relieved. The besieged had 
suffered greatly from lack of food. Within a fortnight Colonel 
Cloete had received the submission of the volksraad at Pieter- 
maritzburg. The burghers represented that they were under 
the protection of Holland, but this plea was peremptorily rejected 
by the commander of the British forces. 

The British government was still undecided as to its policy 
towards Natal. In April 1842 Lord Stanley (afterwards 14th 
earl of Derby), then secretary for the colonies in the second Peel 
Administration, wrote to Sir George Napier that the establishment 
of a colony in Natal would be attended with little prospect of 



26o 



NATAL 



advantage, but at the same time stated that the pretensions of 
the emigrants to be regarded as an independent community 
could not be admitted. Various measures were proposed which 
would but have aggravated the situation. Finally, in deference 
to the strongly urged views of Sir George Napier, Lord Stanley, 
in a despatch of the 13th of December, received in Cape Town 
on the 23rd of April 1843, consented to Natal becoming a 
British colony. The institutions adopted were to be as far as 
possible in accordance with the wishes of the people, but it was 
a fundamental condition " that there should not be in the eye of 
the law any distinction or disqualification whatever, founded 
on mere difference of colour, origin, language or creed." Sir 
George then appointed Mr Henry Cloete (a brother of Colonel 
Cloete) a special commissioner to explain to the Natal volksraad 
the decision of the government. There was a considerable party 
of Natal Boers still strongly opposed to the British, and they 
were reinforced by numerous bands of Boers who came over the 
Drakensberg from Winburg and Pot chef stroom. Commandant 
Jan Mocke of Winburg (who had helped to besiege Captain Smith 
at Durban) and others of the " war party " attempted to induce 
the volksraad not to submit, and a plan was formed to murder 
Pretorius, Boshof and other leaders, who were now convinced 
that the only chance of ending the state of complete anarchy 
into which the country had fallen was by accepting British 
sovereignty. In these circumstances the task of Mr Henry 
Cloete was one of great difficulty and delicacy. He behaved with 
the utmost tact and got rid of the Winburg and Potchefstroom 
burghers by declaring that he should recommend the Drakensberg 
as the northern limit of Natal. On the 8th of August 1843 
Natal the Natal volksraad unanimously agreed to the terms 

annexed proposed by Lord Stanley. Many of the Boers who 
fcrOrea* would not acknowledge British rule trekked once 
more over the mountains into what are now the Orange 
Free State and Transvaal provinces. At the end of 1843 there 
were not more than 500 Dutch families left in Natal. Cloete, 
before returning to the Cape, visited Panda and obtained from 
him a valuable concession. Hitherto the Tugela from source to 
mouth had been the recognized frontier between Natal and 
Zululand. Panda gave up to Natal all the territory between 
the Buffalo and Tugela rivers, now forming Klip River county. 

Although proclaimed a British colony in 1843, and in 1844 
declared a part of Cape Colony, it was not until the end of 1845 
that an effective administration was installed with Mr Martin 
West as lieutenant-governor, and the power of the volksraad 
finally came to an end. In that year the external trade of Natal, 
almost entirely with Cape Colony, was of the total value of 
£42,000 — of which £32,000 represented imported goods. 

The new administration found it hard to please the Dutch 
farmers, who among other grievances resented what they con- 
sidered the undue favour shown to the Kaffirs, whose numbers 
had been greatly augmented by the flight of refugees from Panda. 
In 1843, f° r instance, no fewer than 50,000 Zulus crossed the 
Tugela seeking the protection of the white man. The natives 
were settled in 1846 in specially selected locations and placed 
under the general supervision of Sir (then Mr) Theophilus Shep- 
stone (q.v.). Sir Harry Smith, newly appointed governor of the 
Cape, met, on the banks of the upper Tugela, a body of farmers 
preparing to recross the Drakensberg, and by remedying their 
grievances induced many of them to remain in Natal. Andries 
Pretorius and others, however, declined to remain, and from this 
time Pietorius (q.v.) ceased his connexion with Natal. Although 
by this migration the white population was again considerably 
reduced, those who remained were contented and loyal, and 
through the arrival of 4500 emigrants from England in the years 
1848-1851 and by subsequent immigration from oversea the 
colony became overwhelmingly British in character. From the 
time of the coming of the first considerable body of British 
settlers dates the development of trade and agriculture in the 
colony, followed somewhat later by the exploitation of the 
mineral resources of the country. At the same time schools were 
established and various churches began or increased their work 
in the colony. Dr Colenso, appointed bishop of Natal, arrived in 



1854. In 1856 the dependence of the country on Cape Colony was 
put to an end and Natal constituted a distinct colony with a 
legislative council of sixteen members, twelve" elected by the 
inhabitants and four nominated by the crown. At the time the 
white population exceeded 8000. While dependent on the Cape, 
ordinances had been passed establishing Roman-Dutch law as 
the law of Natal, and save where modified by legislation it 
remained in force. . 

The British settlers soon realized that the coast lands were 
suited to the cultivation of tropical or semi-tropical products, and 
from 1852 onward sugar, coffee, cotton and arrow-root Indian 
were introduced, tea being afterwards .substituted for coolies 
coffee. The sugar industry soon became of importance, l f tr0 j 
and the planters were compelled to seek for large numbers 
of labourers. The natives, at ease in their locations, did not 
volunteer in sufficient numbers, and recourse was had to coolie 
labour from India. The first coolies reached Natal in i860. They 
came under indentures, but at the expiration of their contract 
were allowed to settle in the colony. 1 This proved one of the 
most momentous steps taken in the history of South Africa, for 
the Indian population rapidly increased, the " free " Indians be- 
coming market gardeners, farmers, hawkers, traders, and in time 
serious competitors with the whites. But in i860 and for many 
years afterwards these consequences were not foreseen, and alone 
among the South Africa states Natal offered a welcome to Asiatics. 

In 1866 the borders of the colony were extended on the south- 
west by the annexation of part of Kaffraria that had formerly 
been under the sway of the Pondo chief Faku, who 
found himself unable to maintain his authority in Ke * te 
a region occupied by many diverse tribes. The newly awards. 
acquired territory was named Alfred county in memory 
of a visit paid to Natal by Prince Alfred (afterwards duke of 
Saxe-Coburg-Gotha). In 1867 R. W. Keate (1814-1873) became 
lieutenant-governor, a post which he filled until 1872. His 
administration is notable, not so much for internal affairs but 
from the fact that he twice acted as arbitrator in disputes in 
which the Boer states were involved. In a dispute between the 
Transvaal and the Orange Free State he decided (February 1870) 
that the Klip river and not the upper Vaal was the frontier 
stream. A more famous decision, that known as the Keate 
Award, was given in October 1871. It concerned the south- 
western frontiers of the Transvaal, and the award, which was 
against the Transvaal pretensions, had important effects on 
the history of South Africa (see Transvaal and South Africa). 

During all this time little was done to alter the condition of 
the natives. There was scarcely an attempt to copy the policy, 
deliberately adopted in Cape Colony, of educating and civilizing 
the black man. Neither was Natal faced with the Cape problem 
of a large half-caste population. The Natal natives were left 
very much in the state in which they were before the advent of 
the white men. While this opportunity of educating and training 
a docile people was in the main neglected, savage abuse of power 
by their chiefs was prevented. Under the superintendence 
of Shepstone the original refugees were quiet and contented, 
enjoying security from injustice and considerable freedom. 
This ideal lot, from the native point of view, drew such numbers 
of immigrants from disturbed districts that with the natural 
increase of population in thirty years the native inhabitants 
increased from about 100,000 to fully 350,000. New generations 
grew up almost as ignorant as their fathers, but not with the 
same sense of dependence upon the white men. In this way was 
sown the seed of future trouble between the two races. The 
first serious collision between the natives and the government 
occurred in 1873. The Amahlubi, one of the highest in rank 
of the Bantu tribes of South Africa, fleeing from the cruelties of 

1 Between i860 and 1866 some 5000 Indians entered the colony. 
Immigration then ceased, and was not resumed until 1874. By that j 
year the natives from Portuguese territory and elsewhere who had 
Found employment in Natal had been attracted to the Kimbcrley 
diamond mines, and the Natal natives not coming forward (save under 
compulsion), the importation of Indian coolies was again permitted 
(see the Natal Blue Book, Report of the Indian Immigration Com- 
mission, 1909).

Panda, had been located by the Natal government under their 
chief Langalibalele (i.e. the great sun which shines and burns) 
in 1848 at the foot of the Drakensberg with the object of prevent- 
ing the Bushmen who dwelt in the mountains plundering the 
upland farmers. Here the Amahlubi prospered, and after the 
diamond fields had been discovered many of the young men 
who had been to Kimberley brought back firearms. These 
Langalibalele refused to register, and entered into negotiations 
with several tribes with the object of organizing a general revolt. 
Prompt action by Sir Benjamin Pine, then lieutenant-governor 
of the colony, together with help from the Cape and 
bSefc'a Basutoland, prevented the success of Langalibalele's 
rebellion, plan, and his own tribe, numbering some 10,000 persons, 
was the only one which rebelled. The chief was 
captured, and exiled to Cape Colony (August 1874). Permitted 
to return to Natal in 1886, he died in 1889. 

This rebellion drew the attention of the home government to 
the native question in Natal. The colonists, if mistaken in 
their general policy of leaving the natives in a condition of 
mitigated barbarism, had behaved towards them with uniform 
kindness and justice. They showed indeed in their dealings both 
with the natives within their borders and with the Zulus beyond 
the Tugela a disposition to favour the natives at the expense 
of their white neighbours in the Transvaal and Orange Free 
State, and their action against Langalibalele was fully justified 
and the danger of a widespread native revolt real. But there 
were those, including Bishop Colenso, who thought the treatment 
of the Amahlubi wrong, and their agitation induced the British 
government to recall Sir Benjamin Pine, Sir Garnet Wolseley 
being sent out as temporary governor. Sir Garnet reported 
the natives as " happy and prosperous — well off in every sense." 
As a result of consultations with Shepstone certain modifications 
were made in native policy, chiefly in the direction of more 
European supervision. 

Meantime the colony had weathered a severe commercial 
crisis brought on in 1865 through over-speculation and the 
neglect of agriculture, save along the coast belt. But 
Colenso tne tra( ^ e over berg largely developed on the dis- 
affain covery of the Kimberley diamond mines, and the 
progress of the country was greatly promoted by the 
substitution of the railway for the ox wagon as a means of 
transport. There already existed a short line from the Point 
at Durban to the Umgeni, and on the 1st of January 1876 Sir 
Henry Bulwer, who had succeeded Wolseley as governor, turned 
the first sod of a new state-owned railway which was completed 
as far as Maritzburg in 1880. At this date the white inhabitants 
numbered ahout 20,000. But besides a commercial crisis the 
colony had been the scene of an ecclesiastical dispute which 
attracted widespread attention. Bishop Colenso (q. v.), condemned 
in 1863 on a charge of heresy, ignored the authority of the court 
of South African bishops and was maintained in his position by 
decision of the Privy Council in England. This led to a division 
among the Anglican community in the colony and the consecra- 
tion in 1869 of a rival bishop, who took the title of bishop of 
Maritzburg. Colenso's bold advocacy of the cause of the natives 
— which he maintained with vigour until his death (in 1883) — 
attracted almost equal attention. His native name was Usobantu 
{father of tlte people). 

For some years Natal, in common with the other countries of 
South Africa, had suffered from the absence of anything resem- 
bling a strong government among the Boers of the Transvaal, 
neighbours of Natal on the north. The annexation of the 
Transvaal to Great Britain, effected by Sir Theophilus Shepstone 
in April 1877, would, it was hoped, put a period to the disorders 
in that country. But the new administration at Pretoria in- 
herited many disputes with the Zulus, disputes which were in 
large measure the cause of the war of 1879. For years the 
Zulus had lived at amity with the Natalians, from whom they 
received substantial favours, and in 1872 Cetywayo (q.v.) f 
on succeeding his father Panda, had given assurances of good 
behaviour. These promises were not kept for long, and by 1878 
his attitude had become so hostile towards both the Natal and 



Transvaal governments that Sir Bartle Frere, then High Com- 
missioner for South Africa, determined on his reduction. During 
the war (see Zululand) Natal was used as the British base, 
and the Natal volunteers rendered valuable service in the 
campaign, which, after opening with disasters to the British 
forces, ended in the breaking of the Zulu power. (F. R. C.) 

Scarcely had the colony recovered from the shock of the 
Zulu War than it was involved in the revolt of the Transvaal 
Boers (1880-1881), an event which overshadowed all satal 
domestic concerns. The Natalians were intensely ***d the 
British in sentiment, and resented deeply the policy YxxthJit 
adopted by the Gladstone administration. At In- 
gogo, Majuba and Laing's Nek, all of them situated within 
the colony, British forces had been defeated by the Boers. 
And the treaty of retrocession was never regarded in Natal as 
anything but a surrender. It was clearly understood that the 
Boers would aim to establish a republican government over the 
whole of South Africa, and that the terms of peace simply meant 
greater bloodshed at no distant date. The protest made by 
the Natalians against the settlement was in vain. The Transvaal 
Republic was established, but the prediction of the colonists, 
ignored at the time, was afterwards fulfilled to the letter. In 
justice, however, to the colonists of Natal it must be recorded 
that, finding their protest with regard to the Transvaal settle- 
ment useless, they made up their minds to shape their policy 
in conformity with that settlement. But it was not long before 
their worst fears with regard to the Boers began to be realized, 
and their patience was once more severely taxed. The Zulu 
power, as has been recorded, was broken in 1879. After the 
war quarrels arose among the petty chiefs set up by Sir Garnet 
Wolseley, and in 1883 some Transvaal Boers intervened, and 
subsequently, as a reward for the assistance they had rendered 
to one of the combatants, demanded and annexed 8000 sq. m. 
of country, which they styled the " New Republic." As the 
London Convention had stipulated that there should be no 
trespassing on the part of the Boers over their specified boundaries, 
and as Natal had been the basis for those operations against 
the Zulus on the part of the British in 1879, which alone made 
such an annexation of territory possible, a strong feeling was 
once more aroused in Natal. The " New Republic," reduced in 
area, however, to less than 2000 sq. m., was nevertheless recog- 
nized by the British government in 1886, and in 1888 its consent 
was given to the territory (the Vryheid district) being incor- 
porated with the TransvaaL Meantime, in 1887, the remainder 
of Zululand had been annexed to Great Britain (see Zululand). 

In 1884 the discovery of gold in De Kaap Valley, and on 
Mr Moodie's farm in the Transvaal, caused a considerable rush 
of colonists from Natal to that country. Railways were still 
far from the Transvaal border, and Natal not only sent her own 
colonists to the new fields, but also offered the nearest route for 
prospectors from Cape Colony or from Europe. Durban was 
soon thronged; and Pietermaritzburg, which was then practi- 
cally the terminus of the Natal railway, was the base from which 
nearly all the expeditions to the goldfields were fitted out. 
The journey to De Kaap by bullock-waggon occupied about 
six weeks. " Kurveying " (the conducting of transport by 
bullock-waggon) in itself constituted a great industry. Two 
years later, in 1886, the Rand goldfields were proclaimed, and 
the tide of trade which had already set in with the 
Transvaal steadily increased. Natal colonists were Q ™ w 
not merely the first in the field with the transport industries. 
traffic to the new goldfields; they became some of 
the earliest proprietors of mines, and for several years many of 
the largest mining companies had their chief offices at Pieter- 
maritzburg or Durban. In this year (1886) the railway reached 
Ladysmith, and in 1891 it was completed to the Transvaal 
frontier at Charlestown, the section from Ladysmith northward 
opening up the Dundee and Newcastle coalfields. Thus a new 
industry was added to the resources of the colony. 

The demand which the growing trade made upon the one 
port of Natal, Durban, encouraged the colonists to redouble 
their efforts to improve their harbour. The question of a fairway

from ocean to harbour has been a difficult one at nearly every 
port on the African coast. A heavy sea from the Indian Ocean 
is always breaking on the shore, even in the finest weather, 
and at the mouth of every natural harbour a bar occurs. To 
deepen the channel over the bar at Durban so that steamers 
might enter the harbour was the cause of labour and expenditure 
for many years. Harbour works were begun in 1857, piers and 
jetties were constructed, dredgers imported, and controversy 
raged over the various schemes for harbour improvement. In 
1 88 1 a harbour board was formed under the chairmanship of 
Mr Harry Escombe. It controlled the operations for improving 
the sea entrance until 1893, when on the establishment of re- 
sponsible government it was abolished. The work of improving 
the harbour was however continued with vigour, and finally, in 
1904, such success w T as achieved that vessels of the largest class 
were enabled to enter port (see Durban). At the same time 
the railway system was continually developing. 

For many years there had been an agitation among the 
colonists for self-government. In 1882 the colony was offered 
Self- self-government coupled with the obligations of 

govern- self-defence. The offer was declined, but in 1883 the 
meat legislative council was remodelled so as to consist of 

granted, 23 elected and 7 nominated members. In 1890 
the elections to the council led to the return of a majority in 
favour of accepting self-government, and in 1893 a bill in favour 
of the proposed change was passed and received the sanction 
of the Imperial government. At the time the white inhabitants 
numbered about 50,000. The electoral law was framed to 
prevent more than a very few natives obtaining the franchise. 
Restrictions in this direction dated as far back as 1865, while in 
1896 an act was passed aimed at the exclusion of Indians from 
the suffrage. The leader of the party which sought responsible 
government was Sir John Robinson (1 830-1903) who "had gone 
to Natal in 1850, was a leading journalist in the colony, had 
been a member of the legislative council since 1863, and had 
filled various official positions. He now became the first premier 
and colonial secretary with Mr Harry Escombe (q.v.) as attorney- 
general and Mr F. R. Moor as secretary for Native Affairs. The 
year that witnessed this change in the constitution was also 
notable for the death of Sir Theophilus Shepstonc, Natal's 
most prominent citizen. In the same year Sir Walter Hely- 
Hutchinson became governor. His immediate predecessors 
had been Sir Charles Mitchell (1880-1893) and Sir Arthur 
Havelock (1 886-1 889). Sir John Robinson remained premier 
until 1897, a year marked by the annexation of Zululand to 
Natal. In the following year Natal entered the Customs Union 
already existing between Cape Colony and the Orange Free 
State. Sir John Robinson had been succeeded as premier by 
Mr Harry Escombe (February-October 1897) and Escombe 
by Sir Henry Binns, on whose death in June 1899 Licut.-Colonel 
(afterwards Sir) Albert Hime formed a ministry which remained 
in office until after the conclusion of the Anglo-Boer War. Mean- 
time (in 1 901) Sir Henry McCallum had succeeded Sir Walter 
Hely-Hutchinson as governor. 

For some years Natal had watched with anxiety the attitude 
of increasing hostility towards the British adopted by the 
Pretoria administration, and, with bitter remembrance of the 
events of 1881, gauged with accuracy the intentions of the Boers. 
So suspicious had the ministry become of the nature of the 
military preparations that were being made by the Boers, that 
in May 1899 they communicated their apprehensions to the 
High Commissioner, Sir Alfred Milner, who telegraphed on the 
25th of May to Mr Chamberlain, informing him that Natal was 
uneasy. The governor expressed his views to the prime minister 
that the Natal government ought to give the British government 
every support, and Colonel Hime replied that their support 

would be given, but at the same time he feared the 
If!899- r consec l ucnces to Natal if, after all, the British govern- 
1902. ment should draw back. In July the Natal ministry 

learnt that it was not the intention of the Imperial 
government to endeavour to hold the frontier in case hostilities 
arose, but that a line of defence considerably south of the frontier 



would be taken up. This led to a request on their part that if 
the Imperial government had any reason to anticipate the 
breakdown of negotiations, " such steps may be at once taken 
as may be necessary for the effectual defence of the whole 
colony." Sir William Pcnn Symons, the general commanding 
the British forces in Natal in September, decided to hold Glencoe. 
On the arrival of Lieut. -General Sir George White from India, 
he informed the governor that he considered it dangerous to 
attempt to hold Glencoe, and urged the advisability of with- 
drawing the troops to Ladysmith. The governor was strongly 
opposed to this step, as he was anxious to protect the coal supply, 
and also feared the moral effect of a withdrawal. Eventually 
Sir Archibald Hunter, then chief of staff to Sir Redvers Bullcr, 
was consulted, and stated that in his opinion, Glencoe being 
already occupied, " it was a case of balancing drawbacks, and 
advised that, under the circumstances, the troops be retained 
at Glencoe." This course was then adopted. 

On the nth of October 1899 war broke out. The first act was 
the seizure by the Boers of a Natal train on the Free State border. 
On the 1 2th Laing's Nek was occupied by the Boer forces, who 
were moved in considerable force over the Natal border. New- 
castle was next occupied by the Boers unopposed, and on the 
20th of October occurred the battle of Talana Hill outside 
Dundee. In this engagement the advanced body of British 
troops, 3000 strong, under Symons, held a camp called Craigside 
which lay between Glencoe and Dundee, and from this position 
General Symons hoped to be able to hold the northern portion 
of Natal. There is no doubt that this policy strongly 
commended itself to the governor and ministers of Natal, 
and that they exercised considerable pressure to have it 
adopted. But from a military point of view it was not at all 
cordially approved by Sir George White, and it was after- 
wards condemned by Lord Roberts. Fortunately Symons was 
able to win a complete victory over one of the Boer columns at 
Talana Hill. He himself received a mortal wound in the action. 
Brigadier-General Yule then took command, and an overwhelm- 
ing force of Boers rendering the further occupation of Dundee 
dangerous, he decided to retire his force to Ladysmith. On the 
21st of October General Sir George White and General (Sir John) 
French defeated at Elandslaagte a strong force of Boers, who 
threatened to cut off General Yule's retreat. He again attacked 
the Boer forces at Rietfontein on the 24th of October, and. on 
the 26th General Yule reached Ladysmith in safety. Ladysmith 
now became for a time the centre of military interest. The Boers 
gradually surrounded the town and cut off the communications 
from the south. Various engagements were fought in the 
attempt to prevent this movement, including the actions of 
Farquhar's Farm and Nicholson's Nek on the 30th (see Trans- 
vaal). The investment of Ladysmith continued till the 28th of 
February 1900, when, after various attempts to relieve the 
beleaguered garrison, Sir Redvers Buller's forces at last entered 
the town. During the six weeks previous to the relief, 200 
deaths had occurred from disease alone, and altogether as many 
as 8424 were reported to have passed through the hospitals. 
The relief of Ladysmith soon led to the evacuation of Natal by 
the Boer forces, who trekked northwards. 

During the Boer invasion the government and the loyal 
colonists, constituting the great majority of the inhabitants of 
the colony, rendered the Imperial forces every assistance. A 
comparatively small number of the Dutch colonists joined the 
enemy, but there was no general rebellion among them. As the 
war progressed the Natal volunteers and other Natal forces took 
a prominent part. The Imperial Light Horse and other irregular 
corps were recruited in Natal, although the bulk of the men in 
the forces were Uitlanders from Johannesburg. As the nearest 
colony to the Transvaal, Natal was resorted to by alargenumber 
of men, women and children, who were compelled to leave the 
Transvaal on the outbreak of the war. Refugee and Uitlander 
committees were formed both at Durban and Maritzburg, and, 
in conjunction with the colonists, they did all in their power to 
assist in recruiting irregular corps, and also in furnishing relief 
to the sick and needy.

As one result of the war, an addition was made to the territory 
comprised in Natal, consisting of a portion of what had previously 
been included in the Transvaal. The Natal government origin- 
ally made two proposals for annexing new territory: — 

1. It was proposed that the following districts should be trans- 
ferred to Natal, viz. the district of Vryheid, the district of Utrecht 
and such portion of the district of Wakkerstroom as was comprised 
by a line drawn from the north-eastern corner of Natal, east by 
Volksrust in a northerly direction to the summit of the Drakensberg 
Range, along that range, passing just north of the town of Wakker- 
stroom, to the head waters of the Pongola river, and thence follow- 
ing the Pongola river to the border of the Utrecht district. In 
consideration of the advantage to Natal from this addition of terri- 
tory, Natal should take over £700,000 of the Transvaal debt. 

2. It was proposed to include in Natal such portions of theHarri- 
smith and Vrede districts as were comprised by a line following the 

Elands river north from its source on the Basutoland 
*/*/*" border to its junction with the Wilge river, and thence 
th0 S ° drawn straight to the point where the boundaries of Natal, 
.. the Transvaal and the Orange River Colony meet on the 

frrtt'rf 11 Drakensberg. In consideration of this addition to her 
es. terr i torVj N a tal should take over a portion of the Orange 
River Colony debt, to be raised at the end of the war, to the amount 
of £200,000. 

The Imperial government decided to sanction only the first 
of these two proposals. For this course there were many reasons, 
the Transvaal territory annexed, or the greater part of it (the 
Vryheid district), having been only separated from the rest of 
Zululand in 1883 by a raid of armed Boers. " In handing over 
this district to the administration which controls the rest of 
Zululand, His Majesty's government," wrote Mr Chamberlain, 
under date March 1902, " feel that they are reuniting what ought 
never to have been separated." 

With regard, however, to the proposed transfer of territory 
from the Orange River Colony, the circumstances were different. 
" There is," said Mr Chamberlain, " no such historical reason 
as exists in the case of Vryheid for making the transfer. On the 
contrary, the districts in question have invariably formed part 
of the state from which it is now proposed to sever them, and 
they are separated from Natal by mountains which form a well- 
defined natural boundary. In these circumstances, His Majesty's 
government have decided to confine the territory to be trans- 
ferred to the districts in the Transvaal." 

The districts added to Natal contained about 6000 white 
inhabitants (mostly Dutch), and some 92,000 natives, and had 
an area of nearly 7000 sq. m., so that this annexation meant an 
addition to the white population of Natal of about one-tenth, 
to her native population of about one-tenth also, and to her 
territory of about one-fourth. An act authorizing the annexation 
was passed during 1902 and the territories were formally trans- 
ferred to Natal in January 1903. (A. P. H.; F. R. C.) 

The period following the war was succeeded by commercial 
depression, though in Natal it was not so severely felt as in other 
states of South Africa. The government met the crisis 
menial by renewed energy in harbour works, railway construc- 
depressioa tions and the development of the natural resources 
And of the country. A railway to the Zululand coalfields 

ItbeUlon was com Pl ete< i * n I 9°3> an d in the same year a line 
was opened to Vryheid in the newly annexed territories. 
Natal further built several railway lines in the eastern half of 
the Orange River Colony, thus opening up new markets for her 
produce and facilitating her transit trade. Mr Chamberlain on 
his visit to South Africa came first to Natal, where he landed in 
the last days of 1902, and conferred with the leading colonists. 
In August 1903 the Hime ministry resigned and was succeeded 
by a cabinet under the premiership of Mr (afterwards Sir) George 
Sutton, the founder of the wattle industry in Natal and one of 
the pioneers in the coal-mining industry. In May 1905 Sir 
George Sutton was replaced by a coalition ministry under Mr 
C. J. Smythe, who had been colonial secretary under Sir Albert 
Hime. These somewhat frequent changes of ministry, char- 
acteristic of a country new to responsible government, reflected, 
chiefly, differences concerning the treatment of commercial 
questions and the policy to be adopted towards the natives. 
Towards those Dutch colonists who had joined the enemy 
during the war leniency was shown, all rebels being pardoned. 



The attitude of the natives both in Natal proper and in Zululand 
caused much disquiet. As early as July 1903 rumours were 
current that Dinizulu (a sOn of Cetywayo) was disaffected and 
the power he exercised as representative of the former royal house 
rendered his attitude a matter of great moment. Dinizulu, 
however, remained at the time quiescent, though the Zulus were 
in a state of excitement over incidents connected with the war, 
when they had been subject to raids by Boer commandoes, and 
on one occasion at least had retaliated in characteristic Zulu 
fashion. Unrest was also manifested among the natives west of 
the Tugela, but it was not at first cause for alarm. The chief 
concern of the Natal government was to remodel their native 
policy where it proved inadequate, especially in view of the 
growth of the movement for the federation of the South African 
colonies. During 1903-1904 a Native Affairs' Commission, 
representative of all the states, obtained much evidence on the 
status and conditions of the natives. Its investigations pointed 
to the loosening of tribal ties and to the corresponding growth 
of a spirit of individual independence. Among its recommenda- 
tions was the direct political representation of natives in the 
colonial legislatures on the New Zealand model, and the imposi- 
tion of direct taxation upon natives, which should not be less 
than £1 a year payable by every adult male. The commission 
also called attention to the numerical insufficiency of magistrates 
and native commissioners in certain parts of Natal. With some 
of the recommendations the Natal commissioners disagreed; 
in 1905, however, an act was passed by the Natal legislature 
imposing a poll-tax of £1 on all males over 18 in the colony, 
except indentured Indians and natives paying hut-tax (which 
was 14s. a year). Every European was bound to pay the tax. 
In 1906 a serious rebellion broke out in the colony, attributable 
ostensibly to the poll-tax, and spread to Zululand. It was 
suppressed by the colonial forces under Colonel (afterwards Sir) 
Duncan McKenzie, aided by a detachment of Transvaal 
volunteers. An incident which marked the beginning of this 
rebellion brought the Natal ministry into sharp conflict with 
the Imperial government (the Campbell-Bannerman administra- 
tion). Early in the year a farmer who had insisted that the 
Kaffirs on his farm should pay the poll-tax was murdered, and on 
the 8th of February some forty natives in the Richmond district 
forcibly resisted the collection of the tax and killed a sub- 
inspector of police and a trooper at Byrnetown. Two of the 
natives implicated were court-martialled and shot (February 1 5) ; 
others were subsequently arrested and tried by court martial. 
Nineteen were sentenced to death, but in the case of seven of the 
prisoners the sentence was commuted. On the day before that 
fixed for the execution Lord Elgin, then Secretary of c _.. 
State for the Colonies, intervened and directed the w uh the 
governor to postpone the execution of the sentence, home 
Thereupon the Natal ministry resigned, giving as their x° ven " 
reason the importance of mamtaining the authority of mea * 
the colonial administration at a critical period, and the con- 
stitutional question involved in the interference by the imperial 
authorities in the domestic affairs of a self-governing colony. 
The action of the British cabinet caused both astonishment and 
indignation throughout South Africa and in the other self- 
governing states of the empire. After a day's delay, during which 
Sir Henry McCallum reiterated his concurrence, already made 
known in London, in the justice of the sentence passed on the 
natives, Lord Elgin gave way (March 30). The Natal ministry 
thereupon remained in office. The guilty natives were shot on 
the 2nd of April. 1 It was at this time that Bambaata, a chief 
in the Greytown district who had been deposed for misconduct, 
kidnapped the regent appointed in his stead. He was pursued 
and escaped to Zululand, -where he received considerable help. 
He was killed in battle in June, and by the close of July the 
rebellion was at an end. As has been stated, it was ostensibly 
attributable to the poll-tax, but the causes were more deep- 
seated. Though somewhat obscure they may be found in the

court, were condemned and executed for their share in the Byrne- 
town murders.

growing sense of power and solidarity among all the Kaffir 
tribes of South Africa — a sense which gave force to the " Ethio- 
pian movement," which, ecclesiastical in origin, was political 
in its development. There were moreover special local causes 
such as undoubted defects in the Natal administration. 1 Those 
Africans whose " nationalism " was greatest looked to Dinizulu 
as their leader, and he was accused by many colonists of having 
incited the rebellion. Dinizulu protested his loyalty to the 
British, nor was it likely that he viewed with approval the action 
of Bambaata, a comparatively unimportant and meddlesome 
chief. As time went on, however, the Natal government, 
alarmed at a series of murders of whites in Zululand and at the 
evidences of continued unrest among the natives, became con- 
vinced that Dinizulu was implicated in the rebellious movement. 
When a young man, in 1889, he had been convicted of high 
treason and had been exiled, but afterwards (in 1897) allowed to 
return. Now a force under Sir Duncan McKenzie entered 
Zululand. Thereupon Dinizulu surrendered (December 1907) 
without opposition, and was removed to Maritzburg. His trial 
was delayed until November 1908, and it was not until March 
1909 that judgment was given, the court finding him guilty only 
on the minor charge of harbouring rebels. Meantime, in February 
1908, the governor — Sir Matthew Nathan, who had succeeded 
Sir Henry McCallum in August 1907 — had made a tour in 
Zululand, on which occasion some 1500 of the prisoners taken 
in the rebellion of 1906 were released. 

The intercolonial commission had dealt with the native 
question as it affected South Africa as a whole; it was felt that 
Native a more local investigation was needed, and in August 
Affairs 9 1906 a strong commission was appointed to inquire 
Com ' into the condition of the Natal natives. The general 
m ss on, e i ec tion which was held in theiollowing month turned 
on native policy and on the measures necessary to meet the 
commercial depression. The election, which witnessed the return 
of four Labour members, 'resulted in a ministerial majority of a 
somewhat heterogeneous character, and in November 1966 Mr 
Smythe resigned, being succeeded by Mr F. R. Moor, who in 
his election campaign had criticized the Smythe ministry for 
their financial proposals and for the " theatrical " manner in 
which they had conducted their conflict with the home govern- 
ment. Mr Moor remained premier until the office was abolished 
by the establishment of the Union of South Africa. In August 
1007 the report of the Native Affairs' Commission was published. 
The commission declared that the chasm between the native 
and white races had been broadening for years and that the 
efforts of the administration — especially since the grant of 
responsible government — to reconcile the Kaffirs to the changed 
conditions of rule and policy and to convert them into an element 
of strength had been ineffective. It was not sufficient to secure 
them, as the government had done, peace and ample means of 
livelihood. The commission among other proposals for a more 
liberal and sympathetic native policy urged the creation of a 
native advisory Board entrusted with very wide powers. " Per- 
sonal rule," they declared, " supplies the keynote of successful 
native control " — a statement amply borne out by the influence 
over the natives exercised by Sir T. Shepstone. The unrest in 
Zululand delayed action being taken on the commission's report. 
But in 1909 an act was passed which placed native affairs in the 
hands of four district commissioners, gave to the minister for 
native affairs direct executive authority and created a council 
for native affairs on which non-official members had seats. 
While the district commissioners were intended 'to keep in close 
touch with the natives, the council was to act as a " deliberative, 
consultative and advisory body." 

Concurrently with the efforts made to reorganize their native 
policy the colony also endeavoured to deal with the Asiatic 
question. The rapid growth of the Indian population from 
about 1890 caused much disquiet among the majority of the 
white inhabitants, who viewed with especial anxiety the activities

Book, Cd. 3247. 



of the " free," i.e. unindentured Indians. An act of 1895, which 
did not become effective until 1901, imposed an annual tax of £3 
on time-expired Indians who remained in the colony 
and did not reindenture. In 1897 an Indian a£nsoii 
Immigration Restriction Act was passed with the Indians. 
object of protecting European traders ; in 1 903 
another Immigration Restriction Act among other things, per- 
mitted the exclusion of all would-be immigrants unable to write 
in the characters of some European language. Under this act 
thousands of Asiatics were refused permission to land. In 1906 
municipal disabilities were imposed upon Asiatics, and in 1907 
a Dealers' Licences Act was passed with the object, and effect, 
of restricting the trading operations of Indians. In 1908 the 
government introduced a bill to provide for the cessation of 
Indian emigration at the end of three years; it was not pro- 
ceeded with, but a strong commission was appointed to inquire 
into the whole subject. This commission reported in 1909, its 
general conclusion being that in the interests of Natal the 
importation of indentured Indian labour should not be dis- 
continued. For sugar, tea and wattle growing, farming, coal- 
mining and other industries indentured Indian labour appeared 
to be essential. B ut the evidence was practically unanimous that 
the Indian was undesirable in Natal other than as a labourer 
and the commission recommended compulsory repatriation. 
While desirous that steps should be taken to prevent an increase 
in the number of free Asiatic colonists, the commission pointed 
out that there were in Natal over 60,000 " free " Indians whose 
rights could not be interfered with by legislation dealing with the 
further importation of coolies. But these Indians by reindentur- 
ing might come under the operation of the repatriation proposal. 
Nothing further was done in Natal up to the establishment of 
the Union of South Africa, when all questions specially or 
differentially affecting Asiatics were withdrawn from the com- 
petence of the provincial authorities. 

Not long after the conclusion of the war of 1899-1902 the 
close commercial relations between the Transvaal and Natal 
led to suggestions for a union of the two colonies, but 
these suggestions were not seriously entertained. The

ment tor 



divergent interests of the various colonies threatened union, 
indeed a tariff and railway war when the Customs 
Convention (provisionally renewed in March 1906) should 
expire in 1908. But at the close of 1906 the Cape ministry formally 
reopened the question of federation, and at a railway con- 
ference held in Pretoria in May 1908 the Natal delegates 
agreed to a motion affirming the desirability of the early union 
of the self-governing colonies. The movement for union rapidly 
gained strength, and a National Convention to consider the 
matter met in Durban in October 1908. In Natal, especially 
among the older colonists, who feared that in a united South 
Africa Natal interests would be overborne, the proposals for 
union were met with suspicion and opposition, and the Natal 
ministry felt bound to submit the question to the people. A 
referendum act was passed in April 1909, and in June following 
the electors by 11,121 votes to 3701 decided to join the Union. 
(See South Africa.) 

Natal was concerned not only with the political aspects of 
union, and with its natives and Indian problems, but had to 
safeguard its commercial interests and to deal with a revenue 
insufficient for its needs. In 1908 an Income Tax and a Land 
Tax Act was passed; the land tax being a halfpenny in the £ 
" on the aggregate unimproved value " — it brought in £30,000 
in 1 908-1909. Meantime it was agreed by the Cape, Transvaal 
and Natal governments that, subject to Natal entering the 
Union, its share of the Rand import trade should be 25% before 
and 30% after the establishment of the Union. Previously 
Natal had only 22^% of the traffic, and this agreement led to a 
revival in trade. Moreover, the development of its coal-mines 
and agriculture was vigorously prosecuted, and in 19 10 it was 
found possible to abolish both the Income Tax and Land Tax 
and yet have a surplus in revenue. The closing months of 
Natal's existence as a separate colony thus found her peaceful 
and prosperous. The governor, Sir Matthew Nathan, had

returned to England in December 1909, and Lord Methuen was 
governor from that time until the 31st of May 1910. On that 
date the Union of South Africa was established, Natal becoming 
one of the original provinces of the Union.

NATAL, a city and port of Brazil and capital of the state of 
Rio Grande do Norte, on the right bank of the Rio Potengy, 
or Rio Grande do Norte, about 2 m. above its mouth. Pop. of 
the municipality (1890) 13,725. Natal is the starting-point of 
the Natal and Nova Cruz railway, and is a port of call for coast- 
wise steamers, which usually anchor outside the bar. It is a 
stagnant, poorly built town of one-storeyed houses and mud- 
walled cabins, with few public edifices and business houses of 
a better type. The only industry of note is the manufacture 
of cotton. The exports are chiefly sugar and cotton. Natal was 
founded in 1597 as a military post to check an illicit trade in 
Brazil-wood. In 1633 it was occupied by the Dutch, who 
remained tuitil 1654. It hecame the capital of a province in 
1820. In early works it is sometimes termed Cidade dos Reis 
(City of the Kings). 

NATANZ, a minor province of Persia, situated in the hilly 
district between Isfahan and Kashan, and held in fief by the 
family of the Hissam es Saltaneh (Sultan Murad Mirza, d. 1882). 
It contains eighty-two villages and hamlets, has a revenue of 
about £4000, and a population of about 23,000. It is divided 
into four districts: Barzrud, Natanzrud, Tarkrud and Badrud. 
Natanz pears are famous throughout the country. The western 
part of the province is traversed from north to south by the 
old high-road between Kashan and Isfahan, with the well-known 
stations of Kuhrnd (7140 ft.) and So (7560 ft.). This road was 
practically abandoned when the Indian government telegraph 
line, which ran along it, was removed to a road farther east in 
1906. The capital of the little province is Natanz, a large village 
with a population of about 3000, situated 69 m. north of Isfahan, 
at an elevation of 5670 ft. It has an old mosque, with a minaret 
123 ft. in height, built in 1315. 

NATCHEZ, a city and the county-seat of Adams county, 
Mississippi, U.S.A., on the Mississippi river, about 100 m. S.W. 
of Jackson. Pop. (1890) 10,101, (1900) 12,210, of whom 7090 



were negroes, (1910 census) 11,791. It is served by the 
Yazoo & Mississippi Valley, the St Louis, Iron Mountain & 
Southern, the New Orleans & North-Western and the Mississippi 
Central railways, and by steamboats on the Mississippi river. 
The city, which has an area of 2-19 sq. m., is mostly on a hluff 
that rises 200 ft. above the river, the wharfs and landings, and a 
few old buildings being the only reminders of what was before 
the Civil War the principal business section. Among the city's 
institutions are the Fisk Public Library, a charity hospital, 
two sanatoriums, three orphan asylums, Stanton College for 
girls (non-sectarian; opened in 1894 and lodged in the old Fisk 
mansion), St Joseph's College for girls, the Jefferson Military 
College (1802), 6 m. from the city, and Natchez College for 
negroes. The city has four puhlic parks, three on the river 
front, and one, Memorial Park, in honour of Confederate dead, 
in the heart of the city. On a neighbouring bluff is a national 
cemetery. Just outside the city timits, at Gloster, the former 
estate of Winthrop Sargent, first governor of the Territory of 
Mississippi, are the graves of Sargent and S. S. Prentiss, who lived 
in Natchez for some years. In and near the city are many 
handsome old residences typical of ante-bellum Natchez, among 
them being: Monmouth, General Quitman's estate; Somerset 
and Oakland, long in the Chotard family; and The Briars, 
the home during girlhood of Varina Howell, the wife of Jefferson 
Davis. A Roman Catholic cathedral (1841), Trinity Protestant 
Episcopal Church (1825) and a Presbyterian church (1829) 
are the principal church buildings. The Prentiss and the Elk 
are the leading clubs. Mardi Gras is annually celebrated. The 
leading industries are the shipment of cotton (70,000 to 90,000 
bales are handled annually) and the manufacture of cottonseed 
oil and cake — the first cottonseed-oil mill in the country was 
built here in 1834 — cotton goods, rope and yarns, lumher, 
brick, drugs and ice. Natchez was the first city in the state to 
own municipal water- works and sewage system. 

The city was named from the Natchez Indians who lived on 
its site when the country was first settled. In 1 716 on the bluff 
Le Moyne de Bienville built Fort Rosalie for the protection of 
some French warehouses, and later the French demanded a 
neighbouring hill for another settlement. This offended the 
Natchez, and on the 28th of November 1729 they massacred the 
French and destroyed the fort, which was immediately rebuilt, 
and in 1764 was handed over to the English in accordance with 
the treaty of Paris, and became Fort Panmurej'in 1779 it was 
turned over to the Spanish, who held it until 1798, when they 
withdrew and United States troops occupied the place. Under 
Spanish rule Natchez was the seat of government of a large district, 
and from 1798 to 1802 and from 1817 to 1821 it was the capital of 
Mississippi. It was chartered as a city in 1803. On the 7th of 
May 1840 a large part of the city was destroyed by a tornado, 
but it was soon rebuilt, and at the outbreak of the Civil War was 
a place of considerable wealth and culture. For several years it 
was the home of General John Anthony Quitman (1 790-1858). 
Natchez surrendered to Union forces during the Vicksburg 
campaigns, first on the 12th of May 1862, and again on the 
13th of July 1863. On the 2nd of September 1862 the 
Union iron-clad " Essex," commanded by William David 
Porter, bombarded the city and put an end to the commercial 
importance of the river front section. 

NATHANAEL, a character in the New Testament, who appears 
in John i. 45 sqq. as one of the first disciples of Jesus. In John 
xxi. 2 he is described as belonging to Cana of Galilee. The 
account of his call reveals to us a man of a deeply spiritual 
and sincere nature. Otherwise we know nothing beyond the 
mention of his name as one of the seven to whom, after the 
Resurrection, Christ revealed himself at the sea of Tiberias 
(John xxi. 2). But the interest he has evoked is shown by the 
attempts to identify him with other New Testament characters. 
Of these the one which has found most favour sees in him 
the apostle Bartholomew (q-v.). The actual identification must 
however remain a matter of pure conjecture. Still less can 
be said for the attempts to find in Nathanael another 
name for the apostle Matthew, or for Matthias, or for Paul " the

NATHUBHOY, SIR MANGALDAS (1832-1890), Seth or head 
of the Kapol Bania caste, well known for their thrift and keen 
commercial instincts. He was horn on the 15th of October 
1832, of a family whose ancestors emigrated from Diu to 
Bombay soon after Bombay came into British possession. His 
grandfather, Ramdas Manordas, amassed a considerable fortune, 
which, owing to the premature death of his father, came into 
the sole possession of Mangaldas at the age of eleven. He had 
to take charge of the business in early life, though he gave some 
time to English studies. On the death of his wife he established 
a dispensary at Kalyan in her memory and also a special female 
ward in connexion with the David Sassoon hospital in Poona. 
As a merchant Mangaldas was upright and successful. In social 
matters he stood forth as a reformer, and to him the change to 
election from hereditary succession to the headship of the caste 
is due. In 1862 he founded a fellowship in Bombay university 
to allow graduates to spend some years in Europe. A bequest 
in his will enabled the university to establish seven similar 
scholarships. He took keen interest in learning, and in such 
institutions as the Asiatic and geographical societies. In 1866 
he was nominated to the legislative council and sat till 1874. 
In 1867 he revived the Bombay association, a political body, 
over which he presided for a time. In 1872 he was made C.G.I. , 
and in 1875 the dignity of Knight Bachelor was conferred on 
him. Besides a large donation to the Indian Famine Fund, 
Sir Mangaldas is known to have expended £500,000 on charities. 
He died at Bombay on the 9th of March 1890. 

NATICK, a township of S.E. Middlesex county, Massachusetts, 
U.S.A., on the S.E. end of Cochituate Lake. Pop. (1890) 9118; 
(1900) 9488, of whom 1788 were foreign-born; (1910 census) 
9866. The area of the township is 1 2-375 sq. m. The township's 
largest village, also named Natick, lying 18 m. W.S.W. of Boston, 
is served by the Boston & Albany railroad; it has the Walnut 
Hill preparatory school, the Leonard Morse hospital, and a public 
library, the Morse institute, which was given by Mary Ann 
Morse (1825-1862) and was built in 1873. In the village of 
South Natick is the Bacon Free Library (1880), in which is 
housed the Historical, Natural History and Library Society. 
In 1905 the factory product was valued at $3>453>°94; the 
boots and shoes manufactured in 1005 were valued at $2,896,110 
or 83-9% of the town's total, the output of brogans being 
especially important. Other distinctive manufactures are shirts 
and base-balls. Natick is the Indian name, signifying "our 
land,'\or " hilly land/' of the site (originally part of Dedham) 
granted in 1650 to John Eliot, for the " praying " Indians. 
There was an Indian church in Natick, at what is now called 
South Natick or " Old town," from 1660 to 17 16; and for some 
years the community was governed, in accordance with the 
eighteenth chapter of Exodus, by " rulers of tens," " rulers 
of fifties," and " rulers of hundreds." Until 1719 the Indians 
held the land in common. In 1735 the few Indians remaining 
were put under guardianship. The township owns a copy 
of Eliot's Indian Bible. An Eliot monument was erected in 
1847 on the Indian burying-ground near the site of the Indian 
church, now occupied by a Unitarian church. Of the Eliot 
oaks, made famous by Longfellow's sonnet, one was cut down 
in 1842, the other still stands. Henry Wilson learned to make 
shoes here, and in the presidential campaign in 1840 gained the 
sobriquet of the " Natick cohbler." By the colonial authorities 
Natick was considered as a " plantation " until the establishment 
of the church; in 1762 the parish (erected in 1745) became a 
district, and in 1 78 1 this was incorporated as a town.

NATIONAL ANTHEMS OR HYMNS. The selection of some 
particular songs, words and music, as the formal expression 
of national patriotism, is a comparatively modern development 



of ceremonial usage. In Europe the chief national anthems 
are: The United Kingdom: " God save the king " (see below); 
France: "The Marseillaise," by Rouget de Lisle; Germany: 
" Heil dir im Siegeskranz," words by Balthasar Gerhard 
Schumacher, music of " God save the King "; Switzerland: 
" Rufst du, mein Vaterland," music of " God save the King "; 
Italy: the " Royal March " by G. Gabetti; Austria: " Gott 
erhalte unsern Kaiser," words by L. L. Haschka, music by 
Haydn; Hungary: " Isten aid meg a Magyart "; Belgium: 
"La Brabanconne," by F. Campenhout; Holland: " Wien 
Nierlansch "; Denmark: "Heil dir, dem Liebenden," words 
by H. Harries, music of "God save the King," and "King 
Kristian stod ved hojen mast," words by Ewald, music by 
Hartman; Sweden: M Ur Svenska hjertans "; Russia: 
" Bozhe Zaria chrany," words by J. J. Canas, music by D. 
Jenko; Rumania: " Traeasca Regale," words by V. Alexandri, 
music by E. A. Hiibsch; Spain: " Himno de Riego," music 
by Herta. In the United States, the " Star Spangled Banner " 
(1814; words by F.S. Key, music by J. S. Smith) and "Hail 
Columbia " (1798; words by Joseph Hopkinson, music by 
Fyles) share the duties of a national anthem, while the tune

of " God save the King " is sung to words beginning 
country, 'tis of thee," by Samuel F. Smith (1808-1895). 



My 



The most celebrated of all national anthems is the English 
" God save the King." which is said to have been first sung 
as his own composition by Henry Carey in 1740; and a version 
was assigned by W. Chappell (Popular Music) to the Harmonia 
Anglicana of 1742 or 1743, but no copy exists and this is now 
doubted. Words and music were printed in the Gentleman's 
Magazine for October 1745. There has been much controversy 
as to the authorship, which is complicated by the fact that 
earlier forms of the air and the words are recorded. Such are 
an " Ayre " of 1619, attributed to John Bull, who has long been 
credited with the origin of the anthem; the Scottish carol, 
" Remember, O thou man," in Ravenscroft's Melismata, 161 1; 
the ballad " Franklin is fled away " (printed 1669; and a 
piece in Purcell's Choice Collection for the Harpsichord (1696). 
The words or part of them are also found in various forms from 
the 16th century. The question was discussed in Richard 
Clarke's Account of the National Anthem (1822), and has been 
reinvestigated by Dr W. H. Cummings in his God save the 
King (1902). Carey and Bull, in the general opinion of musical 
historians, divide the credit; but in his Minstrelsy of England 
(1901) Frank Kidson introduced a new claimant, James Oswald, 
a Scotsman who settled in London in 1742, and worked for 
John Simpson, the publisher of the early copies of God save the 
King] and who became chamber composer to George III. What 
appears to be certain is that 1745 is the earliest date assignable 
to the substantial national anthem as we know it, and that 
both words and music had been evolved out of earlier forms. 
Bull's is the earliest form of the air; Carey's claim to the re- 
modelling of the anthem rests on an unauthoritative tradition; 
and, on general probabilities, Oswald is a strong candidate. 
The tune was adopted by Germany and by Denmark before 
the end of the 18th century. 

NATIONAL DEBT. Details as to the recent figures of the 
national debts of individual countries are given under the 
heading of each country, and the reader is also referred to the 
article Finance. Here the subject is considered in its technical 
aspects — including the special character of the institution, the 
different classes of debt, the various methods of raising loans, 
interest, funding systems, comparative statistics of national 
debts and other points. 

National debt is so universal that it has been described as 
the first stage of a nation towards civilization. A nation, so 
far as its finances are concerned, may be regarded as a corporate 
body or even as an individual. Like the one or the other it may 
borrow money at rates of interest, and with securities, general 
or special, proportionate to its resources, credit and stability. 
But, while in this respect' there are certain points of analogy 
between a state and an individual, there are important points of 
difference so far as the question of debt is concerned. A state, 



NATIONAL DEBT 



267 



for example, may be regarded as imperishable, and its debt as a 
permanent institution which it is not bound to liquidate at any 
definite period, the interest, unless specially stipulated, being 
thus of the nature of transferable permanent annuities. While 
an individual who borrows engages to pay interest to the lender 
personally, and to reimburse the entire debt by a certain date, 
a state may have an entirely different set of creditors every six 
months, and may make no stipulation whatever with regard to 
the principal. A state, moreover, is the sole judge of its own 
solvency, and is not only at liberty either to repudiate its debts 
or compound with its "creditors, but even when perfectly solvent 
may materially alter the conditions on which it originally 
borrowed. These distinctions explain many of the peculiarities 
of national debts as contrasted with those of individuals — 
though a nation, like an individual, may by reckless bad faith 
utterly destroy its credit and exhaust its borrowing powers. 

A well-organized state ought to have within itself the means of 
meeting all its ordinary expenses; where this is not the case, 
either through insufficiency of resources or maladministration, 
and where borrowing is resorted to for what may be regarded as 
current expenses, a state imperils, not only its credit, but, when 
any crisis occurs, its very existence; in illustration of this we need 
only refer to the cases of Turkey in Europe and some of the states* 
of Central and South America. Even for meeting emergencies 
it is not always inevitable that a state should incur debt; its 
ordinary resources, from taxation or from state property, may 
so exceed its ordinary expenses as to enable it to accumulate 
a fund for extraordinary contingencies. This, it would seem, was 
a method commonly adopted in ancient states. The Athenians, 
for example, amassed 10,000 talents in the interval between the 
Persian and the Peloponnesian wars, and the Lacedaemonians 
are said to have done the same. At Susa and Ecbatana Alexander 
found a great treasure which had been accumulated by Cyrus. 
In the early days of Rome the revenue from certain sources was 
accumulated as a sacred treasure in the temple of Saturn; 
and we know that when Pompey left Italy he made the mistake 
of leaving behind him the public treasury, which fell into the 
hands of Caesar. In later times, also, the more prudent emperors 
were in the habit of amassing a hoard. We find that the method 
of accumulating reserves prevailed among some of the early 
French kings, even down to the time of Henry IV. This system 
long prevailed in Prussia. Frederick II., when he ascended the 
throne, found in the treasury a sum of 8,700,000 thalers, and 
it is estimated that at his death he left behind him a hoard of 
from 60 to 70 million thalers. And similarly, in our own time, 
of the five milliards of indemnity paid by France as a result of 
the Franco-German War, 150 millions were set apart to recon- 
stitute the traditional war-treasury. The German empire, 
apart from the individual states which comprise it, had in 1882 
a debt of about £24,000,000, while its invested funds amounted 
t0 £37)39o,ooo, including a war-treasure of £6,000,000. The 
majority of economists disapprove of such an accumulation of 
funds by a state as a bad financial policy, maintaining that the 
remission of a proportionate amount of taxation would be much 
more for the real good of the nation. At the same time the 
possession of a moderate war-fund, it must be admitted, could 
not but give a state a great advantage in the case of a sudden 
war. In the case of England, apart from the private hoardings 
of a few sovereigns, there does not seem to have existed any 
deliberately accumulated public treasure; before the time of 
William and Mary English monarchs borrowed money occasion- 
ally from Jews and from the city of London, but emergencies 
were generally met by " benevolences " and increased imposts. 

All modern states, it may be said, have been compelled to 
have recourse to loans, either to meet war expenses, to carry out 
great public undertakings or to make up the recurrent deficits of 
a mismanaged revenue. Resources obtained in this way are 
what constitute national debt proper. Loans have been divided 
into forced and voluntary. Forced loans can, of course, only be 
raised within the bounds of the borrowing country; and, apart 
from the injustice which is sure to attend such an impost, it is 
always economically mischievous. The loans which the kings 



of England were wont to exact from the Jews were really of 
the character of forced loans, though the method has never been 
used in England in modern times so extensively as on the 
continent. There the sum sought to be obtained in this way has 
never been anything like realized. In 1793, for example, a loan 
of this class was imposed in France, on the basis of income; 
and of the milliard (francs) which it was sought to raise only 
100 millions were realized. In Austria and Spain, also, recourse 
has been had at various times to forced loans, but invariably 
with unsatisfactory results. Other methods of a more or less 
compulsory character have been and are made use of in various 
states for obtaining money, which, as they involve the payment 
of interest, may be regarded as of the nature of loans; but the 
debt incurred by such methods is comparatively insignificant, 
and some of the methods adopted are peculiarly irritating and 
mischievous. On the other hand, it has occasionally been 
attempted to raise voluntary loans by appeals to a nation's 
patriotism; the method has been confined almost exclusively 
tb France. After the revolutions of 1830 and 1848 appeals were 
thus made to the patriotism of French capitalists to buy 5% 
direct from the government at par, at a time when the French 5 % 
were selling at 80; but the results were quite insignificant. 
In short, the only economically sound method of meeting ex- 
penses which the ordinary resources of a state cannot meet is 
by borrowing in the open market on the most advantageous terms 
obtainable. On this normal method of borrowing, loans are 
divided into different categories, though there are really only 
two main classes, which may be designated perpetual and 
terminable. Borrowing in quasi-perpetuity has hitherto been 
the mode adopted by most states in the creation of the bulk of 
their debt. Not that any state ever borrows with the avowed 
intention of never paying off debts; but either no definite 
period for reimbursement is fixed, or the limit has been so 
extended as to be practically perpetual, or in actual practice 
the debt has been got rid of by the creation of another of equal 
amount under similar or slightly differing conditions as to interest. 
Of course a state is not bcund to retain any part of its debt as 
a perpetual burden ; it is at liberty to liquidate whenever it suits 
its convenience. This quasi-perpetuity of debt in the case of a 
state in a sound financial condition involves no hardship upon its 
creditors, who may at any moment realize their invested capital 
by selling their titles as creditors in the open money market, it 
may be at the price they paid, or it may be a little below or a 
little above it, according to the state of the market at the time. 
Loans, again, contracted on the terminable principle are of 
various classes; the chief of these are (1) life annuities, (2) 
terminable annuities, (3) loans repayable by instalments at 
certain intervals, (4) loans repayable entirely at a fixed date. 

From the time of William III. life and terminable annuities 
have been a favourite mode in England either of borrowing 
money or of commuting, and thus gradually paying off, the 
existing funded debt. At first, and indeed until comparatively 
recent times, the system of life annuities resulted in serious loss 
to the country, owing to the calculation of the rate of annuity 
on too high a scale, a result arising from imperfect data on which 
to base estimates of the average duration of life. The system of 
life annuities was sometimes combined in England with that of 
perpetual annuities, or interest on the permanent debt — the 
life annuity forming a sort of additional inducement to lenders 
of limited means to invest their money. At one time the form 
of life annuities known as tontine was much in vogue both in 
England and France, the principle of the tontine being that the 
proceeds of the total amount invested by the contributors 
should be divided among the survivors, the last survivor receiving 
the whole interest or annuity. The results of this system were 
not, however, encouraging to the state. In England, at least, 
the terminable annuity has been a favourite mode of borrowing 
from the time of William III.; it has been generally conjoined 
with a low rate of permanent interest on the sum borrowed. 
Thus in 1700 the interest on the consolidated debt amounted 
to only £260,000, while the terminable annuities payable 
amounted to £308,407. In 1780 a loan of 12 millions was raised 



268 



NATIONAL DEBT 



at 4% at par, with the additional benefit of an annuity of 
£i, 16s. 3d.% for eighty years. Even so late as the Crimean 
War in 1855, a loan of 16 millions at 3% at par was contracted, 
the contributors receiving in addition an annuity of 14s. 6d.% 
for thirty years. 

The third method of contracting terminable loans, that of 
gradual repayment or amortization within a certain limit of 
years, has been a favourite one among certain nations, and 
specially commends itself to those whose credit is at a low ebb. 
When the final term of repayment is fixed upon, a calculation is 
easily made as to how much is to be paid half-yearly until the 
expiry of the term, so that at the end the whole, principal and 
interest, will have been paid. At first, of course, the amount 
paid will largely represent interest, but, as at each half-yearly 
drawing of the numbers of the bonds to be finally paid off the 
principal will be gradually reduced, there will be more and more 
money set free from interest for the reduction of the actual debt. 
This method, as we have said, has its advantages, and when 
conjoined with stipulations as to liberty of conversion to debt 
bearing a lower rate of interest than that originally offered, and 
when the bonds are not issued at a figure much below par, 
might be the most satisfactory method of raising money for a 
state under certain emergencies. What is known as the " Morgan 
loan " of France in 1870 was contracted on such conditions. 

The last form of temporary loan,* that repayable in bulk at a 
fixed date, is one which, when the sum is of considerable amount, 
is apt to be attended with serious disadvantages. The repayment 
may have to be made at a time when a state may not be in a 
position to meet it, and so to keep faith with its creditors may 
have to borrow at a higher rate in order to pay their claims. 
It has, however, worked well in the United States, most of the 
debt of which has been contracted on the principle of optional 
payment at the end of a short period, say five years, and com- 
pulsory payment at the end of a longer period, say twenty years. 
Thus the loan of 515 millions of dollars contracted in 1862 was 
issued on this principle, at 6 %, and so with other loans between 
that year and 1868. In European states, however, the risks 
of embarrassment are too great to permit of the application 
of this method on an extensive scale; and for loans of great 
amount the methods most likely to yield satisfactory results 
are loans bearing quasi-perpetual interest, or those repayable 
by instalments on the basis of half-yearly drawings within a 
certain period. 

What are known as lottery loans are greatly favoured on the 
continent, either as an independent means of raising money, or 
as an adjunct to any of the methods referred to above. These 
must not be confounded with the lottery pure and simple, in 
which the contributors run the risk of losing the whole of their 
investment. The lottery loan has been found to work well for 
small sums, when the interest is but little below what it would 
have been in an ordinary loan, and when the percentage thus 
set aside to form prizes of varying amounts forms but a small 
fraction of the whole interest payable. The principle is that 
each contributor of such a loan has a greater or less chance of 
drawing a prize of varying amount, over and above the repayment 
of his capital with interest. 

What are known in England as exchequer bills and treasury 
bills may be regarded as loans payable at a fixed period of short 
duration, from three months upwards, and bearing very in- 
significant interest, even so low as \%. They are a useful 
means of raising money for immediate wants and for local loans, 
and form handy investments for capitalists who are reserving 
their funds for a special purpose. Exchequer bonds are simply 
a special form of the funded debt, to be paid off generally within 
a certain period of years. 

There are two principal methods of issuing or effecting a loan. 
Either the state may appeal directly to capitalists and invite sub- 
scriptions, or it may delegate the negotiation to one or more bankers. 
The former method has been occasionally followed in France and 
Russia, but in practice it has been found to be attended with so 
many disadvantages to the borrowing state or city that the best 
financial authorities consider it unsound. The great banking- 
houses have such a command over the money-market that it is 



difficult to keep even a direct loan out of their hands. The majority 
pi loans, therefore, are negotiated by one or more of these houses, 
and the name of Rothschild is familiar to every one in connexion 
with such transactions. By this method a borrowing state can 
assure itself of having the proceeds of the loan with the least possible 
delay and with the minimum of trouble. A lean may be issued at, 
above, or below par, though generally it is either at or below par — 
" par " being the normal or theoretical price of a single share in the 
loan, the sum which the borrowing government undertakes to pay 
back for each share on reimbursement, without discount orpremium. 
Very generally, as an inducement to investors, a loan is offered at a 
greater or less discount, according to the credit of the borrowing 
government. Sometimes a state may offer a loan to the highest 
bidders; for example, the city of Auckland in 1875 invited sub- 
scriptions through the Bank of New Zealand to a loan of £100,000 
at 6%; offers were made of six times the amount, but only those 
were accepted which were at the rate of 98% or above. The rate of 
interest offered generally depends on the credit of the state issuing 
the loan. England, for example, would have no difficulty in raising 
any amount at 3 % or even less, while less stable states may have to 
pay 8 or 9 %. The nominal percentage is by no means, however, 
always an index of the cost of a loan to a state, as the history of 
the debt of England disastrously shows. During the 18th century 
various expedients were employed, besides that of terminable 
annuities already referred to, to raise money for the great wars 
of the period, at an apparently low percentage. For example, from 
3 to 5% would be offered for a loan, the actual amount of stock 
.per cent, allotted being sometimes 107 J or even m; so that 
between 1776 and 1785, for the £91,763,842 actually borrowed by 
the government, £115,267,993 was to be paid back. In 1797 a loan 
of £1,620,000 was contracted, for every £100 of which actually 
subscribed, at 3%, the sum of £219 was allotted to the lender. 
In 1793 a 3% loan of 45 millions was offered at the price of £72 %, 
the government thus making itself liable for £6,250,000. Greatly 
owing to this reckless method the debt of Great Britain in 1815 
amounted to over 900 millions. France in this respect has been 
quite as extravagant as England; many of her loans during the 
19th century were issued at from 52 J to 84%, one indeed (1848) 
so low as 45% — as a rule with 5% interest. The enormous and 
embarrassing increase of the French debt during the 19th century 
was doubtless greatly due to this disastrous system. Nearly every 
European state and most of the Central and South American states 
have at one time or another aggravated their debts by this method 
of borrowing, and got themselves into difficulty^ with their creditors. 
Financiers almost unanimously maintain that in the long run it is 
much better for a state to borrow at high interest at or near par, 
than at an apparently low interest much below par. A state of even 
the highest rank may find itself in the midst of a crisis that will for 
a time shake its credit; but when the crisis is past and its credit 
revives it will be in a much more sound position with a. high interest 
for a debt contracted at par than with a comparatively low interest 
on a debt much in excess of what it really received. If a state, for 
example, borrows at par at 6 % when its credit is low, it may easily 
when again in a flourishing condition reduce the interest on its debt 
to 4 or even 3 %. The United States government actually did so 
with the debt it had to contract at the time of the Civil War. This 
method of reducing the burden of a debt is evidently no injustice to 
the creditors of a government, when used in a legitimate way. A 
state is at liberty at any time to pay off its debts, and, if it can 
borrow at 3% to pay off a 6% debt, it may with perfect justice 
offer its creditors the option of payment of the principal or of holding 
it at a reduced interest. Government debts are, however, sometimes 
reduced after a fashion by no means so legitimate as this. Other 
states have been even more unprincipled, and have got rid of their 
debts at one sweep by the simple method of repudiation. 

When a state has a variety of loans at varying rates of interest, 
it may consolidate them into a single debt at a^ uniform interest. 
For example, in 1751 several descriptions of English debt were con- 
. solidated into one fund bearing a uniform interest of 3 %, an opera- 
tion which gave origin to the familiar term " consols " (" consoli- 
dated annuities "). In the earlydays of the English national debt, 
a special tax or fund was appropriated to the payment of the interest 
on each particular loan. This was the original meaning of " the 
funds," a term which has now come to signify the national debt 
generally. So also the origin of the term " funded " as applied to a 
debt which has been recognized as at least quasi-permanent, and for 
the payment of the interest on which regular provision is made. 
Unfunded or floating debt, on the other hand, means strictly loans 
for which no permanent provision requires to be made, which have 
been obtained for temporary purposes with the intention of paying 
them off within a brief period. Exchequer and treasury bills are 
included in this category, and such other moneys in the hands of a 
government as it may be required to reimburse at any moment. 
Where a government is the recipient of savings banks deposits, these 
may be included in its floating debt, and so also may the paper- 
money which has been issued so largely by some governments. A 
state with an excessive floating debt must be regarded as in a very 
critical financial condition. 

National debt, again, is divided into external and internal, accord- 
ing as the loans have been raised within or without the country —

some states, generally the smaller ones, having a # considerable 
amount of exclusively internal debt, though it is obvious that the 
bulk of national debts are both external and internal. 

We referred above to various ways of reducing the burden of a 
debt, and also to methods of contracting loans by which within a 
certain period they are amortized or extinguished. Most states, 
however, are burdened with enormous quasi- permanent debts, the 
reduction or extinction of which gives ample scope for the financial 
skill of statesmen. A favourite method of accomplishing this is by 
the establishment of what is known as a sinking fund, formed by 
the setting aside of a certain amount of national revenue for the 
reduction of the principal of the debt. 0* S. K.) 

The following table shows the general state of the world's 
public indebtedness at the beginning of the 20th century, divided 
according to the more important countries, the bracketed 
figures in black type indicating the position of the country 
referred to under each heading in the list. The figures are given 
by preference for the year 1900, as more representative, in a case 
like this, than for some later years; for the Boer War, as regards 
the United Kingdom, and also the Russo-Japanese War, intro- 
duced new debt and new considerations, hardly fair to the 
comparison, while this stands at the end of a long period of 
peace. The figures in every case are not to be supposed to be 
absolutely accurate; statistics of national debts differ, often 
remarkably, and it is practically impossible to give a perfectly 
satisfactory comparison, owing partly to difficulties of computing 
the exchange, partly to inaccurate accounts, and partly to the 
varieties of debt (reproductive or non-reproductive, &c). 



Kingdom (756 millions) stood second to that of France (1000 
millions), in 1900 it stood third to France and Russia; whereas 
in 1883 its weight per head of population was third, in 1900 it 
was eleventh; whereas in 1883 its annual charge stood second, 
in. 1900 it stood fourth; and whereas the weight of the charge 
per head of population in 1883 was fifth, in 1900 it was eleventh. 
The indebtedness of the great British dependencies, on the 
other hand, had increased from 302 millions to 544 millions 
sterling, or by 242 millions; and the local (municipal) debt of 
Great Britain had risen from about 100 millions to upwards of 
300 millions. 

It is interesting to recall the history of the British national 
debt during the 19th century. The debt at the close of the 
Napoleonic war (1816) was nearly 887 millions sterling, History 
and at the beginning of 1900 this debt had been of 
reduced to 621 millions, 1 or a decrease of 266 millions — British 
notwithstanding interim additions of about 367 atbL 
millions, which made the gross reduction during that period 
633 millions sterling, an amount actually larger than the whole 
(dead- weight 2 ) debt at the end of the century. No country 
(except the United States, to a smaller amount) has ever 
redeemed its obligations on such a scale, and this was done 
while all other European countries of similar standing were 
piling up debt. 

This enormous reduction was effected at different rates of 
speed. Between 181 7 and 1830, when what was known as

The total indebtedness of the countries named in the table 
amounted to £6,311,017,478, and the total indebtedness of the 
world (i.e. including countries not here mentioned) for the year 
1898 was computed by Lord Avebury (Joum. Roy. Stat. Soc. 
vol. briv. part i.) as £6,432,757,000, as against £5,097,910,000 
in 1888. This compares (taking figures compiled by Mr Dudley 
Baxter in Joum. Roy. Stat. Soc, March 1874) with a total indebted- 
ness of 4680 millions sterling in 1874 and 1700 millions sterling 
in 1848. The United Kingdom had diminished its total debt 
since 1883 by 127 millions, the amount per head by £6, the annual 
charge by 6 millions, and the charge per head by 5s. 8d. The 
United States debt was lower by nearly a hundred millions. 
Japan, Egypt and Brazil had sensibly improved their positions. 
But the following countries had increased their debts: France 
(by 86 millions), Russia (by some 240 millions), Italy (by 140 
millions), Austria-Hungary (by 70 millions), Spain (by 190 
millions), Prussia (by 227 millions), Portugal (by 80 millions), 
Holland (by 18 millions), Belgium (by32 millions), and Argentina 
(by 73 millions). 

The result is that, whereas in 1883 the total debt of the United 



Pitt's sinking fund was in operation (depending upon the 
devotion of surplus income to the repayment of debt, but much 
complicated by the raising of fresh loans), a net reduction was 
made of £29,488,072 — an annual average of £2,268,313. From 
1830 to 1876 the system of using surplus revenue — the so-called 
old sinking fund — for redeeming debt, was steadily applied, 
together with the creation of terminable annuities, by which 
definite blocks of debt were cancelled and the whole amount 
paid off in a term of years. During this period the debt was 
reduced by £85,175,782, an annual average of £1,851,647. In 
1876 Sir Stafford Northcote's (Lord Iddesleigh/s) new sinking 
fund came into operation, in addition to previous methods of 
redeeming debt. By this system a definite annual sum was set 
aside for the service of the debt, the difference between it and 

1 Leaving out of account 8 millions of unfunded debt raised for 
the Boer War. 

2 The " dead-weight " debt, or national debt proper, excludes what 
are treated in the public accounts as "other capital liabilities," the 
interest on which is not included in the fixed charge; but it is taken 
to include the new debt of all sorts raised in 1900, 1901 and 1902 
for the Boer War.

the amount required for payment of interest forming a (new) 
sinking fund devoted to repayment of capital. This fixed charge 
was gradually reduced from about 29 millions to 26 millions in 
1888, to 25 millions in 1890, and to 23 millions in 1899. 
The amount paid off during this period by means of old 
sinking fund, terminable annuities and new sinking fund, down 
to March 1900, was £155,238,639, or an annual average of 
£6,468,276. 

It will be observed that the burden of the debt incurred 
previously to 18 17 has thus been borne very unequally by 
different ages of " posterity." While the generations immedi- 
ately succeeding the Napoleonic war paid off about £2,000,000 
a year, the taxpayers between 1876 and 1900 paid at three 
times that rate. They did so largely without knowing it, since 
a large part of the amount was wrapped up in the terminable 
annuities; but it is very questionable justice that so large a 
proportion of the burden should have been imposed upon 
them. 

The great bulk of the funded national debt consists of what 
are known as "consols." This name dates from 1751, when 
nine different government annuities at 3% were 
consolidated into one, amounting to £9,137,821. 
These " consolidated annuities " formed the germ of what has 
since become the type of British government stock. At the same 
time some of the annuities at a higher rate of interest were 
combined and the interest reduced to 3%, and this stock 
was known as "reduced," the two 3% stocks remaining 
side by side, until in 1854 the $\% government stock was 
also converted into 3%, under the style of "new threes." 
"Consols," "reduced" and "new threes" formed thenceforth 
a solid body of British 3% stock, until in 1888 the whole 
amount was converted (see Conversions below) by Mr (after- 
wards Lord) Goschen into 2f%. "Consols" were added to 
from time to time when fresh loans were needed: from 
39 millions in 1771 they rose to 71 millions 
in 1781, to 101 millions in 1783, 278 
millions in 1801, 334 millions in 1811, 
and 400 millions in 1858; but in 1888 
they had decreased, by redemptions, to 
£322,681,035. " Reduced " were also added 
to: from 17 millions in 1751 they rose to 
164 millions in 181 5, and then gradually 
diminished to 102 millions in 1869, and to £68,912,433 in 
1887, when they were converted with " consols " into the 
new consols (or " Goschens ") at 2$ %, to be reduced to z\% 
in 1003. 

The lowest price ever quoted for " consols " was 47I on 20th 
September 1797, owing to the mutiny at the Nore; the highest 
was 114 in 1896 owing t& scarcity of stock, the operation of the 
sinking funds, and the demand for investment of savings bank 
moneys. 

The high premium to which consols rose towards the end of 
the century may be briefly explained. Pari passu with the re- 
duction of the debt went a dwindling of the^ amount of consols 
open to investors, and hence occurred a continued normal appre- 
ciation of the stock. In 1817 the amount of British government 
stock per head of the population was £40, 10s.; in 1896 this figure 
had decreased to £14, 12s. The ordinary law of supply and demand 
would therefore in any case tend to increase the price of govern- 
ment stock. This has always happened. The amount of 3% 
diminished from 528 millions in 181 7 to 498 in 1827, and to 407 in 
1837, and the average prices in these years were 73, 83 and 90; 
additions were made to the stock, and in 1847 (the amount being 
j$io millions) the price was 86f; again the amount decreased, and 
in 1852 (500 millions) the price was 98 ; then a great conversion raised 
the amount to 734 millions in 1854, and the price went down to 90 J; 
but by 1887 the amount decreased by about 200 pillions, and the 
price rose well above par; and though the reduction in interest in 
1888 set back the price, it rose again as the amount of available 
stock diminished. Many causes, into which it is not necessaryto 
enter, operated no doubt in keeping up the demand for British 
government credit. Moreover, apart from the- fact that in 1882 
there were 689 millions of 3% and in 1900 only 501 millions 
of 2f % in existence, the amount held by government departments 
and therefore practically^ locked up from the market, gradually 
increased, until from this cause alone the amount of available 
stock was diminished by upwards of 200 millions; and a large 



amount more was practically locked up by being held by trustees, 
or by banks, insurance societies, &c. The savings banks deposits, 
increasing as they did by about £1,000,000 per month (owing partly 
to the raising in 1894 of the maximum limit), had to be invested 
in government securities; and the compulsory activity of the 
government as a buyer of consols, both on this account and also 
For sinking fund purposes (in order to obtain stock to redeem debt 
on the increased scale already indicated) operated as an abnormal 
cause for sending the price of consols high above par. Even at that 
figure (the average prices for consols being 101 r\ in 1894, 106J in 
1895, II 9* in l8 9 6 » II2 H in I ?97, nof| in 1898 and io6J—having 
fallen owing to war prospects — in 1899) it was difficult for the govern- 
ment brokers to obtain consols, and it was principally owing to this 
state of things that in 1899 Sir Michael Hicks-Beach reduced the 
fixed annual charge for the debt (and pro tanto the new sinking fund) 
from £25,000,000 to £23,000,000. 

It may be useful to give the figures for the British natipnal 
debt in 1902, after the disturbance due to the South African 
War. During the years 1900 and 1901 the new sinking fund was 
suspended, as well as the payments on the terminable annuity 
debt applicable to repayment of capital (except in so far as 
annuities to individuals were concerned) ; so that the debt was 
not reduced, as it would otherwise have been, by £4,547,000 in 
1900 and by £4,681,000 in 1901. On the contrary, it was 
increased by fresh borrowings. Consols were raised (in 1901 and 
1902) to the extent of £92,000,000; a " War Loan " of 2! % 
stock and bonds, redeemable in 1910, was raised (1900) to the 
amount of £30,000,000; 2\% exchequer bonds were raised 
(in 1900) to the amount of £24,000,000, and treasury bills (in 
1899 and 1900), £13,000,000. The total war borrowing amounted 
accordingly to £159,000,000, raised at a discount of (£6,585,000) 
4-14%. This includes the whole new borrowing in 1902, a 
portion of which was intended after the peace to be paid back 
in the current year; but for this no allowance can here be made. 
The accompanying table shows the totals for the " dead- weight 
debt " in 1900, 1901 and 1902, and, for convenience, also the

" Other liabilities " it must be remembered, represent money 
advanced (generally by terminable annuity) on reproductive 
objects — telegraphs, barracks, public works, Uganda railway, 
&c. — and they could not, obviously, be properly included in 
the national debt unless at the same time a set-off were made 
for the valuable assets held by the British government, such as 
the Suez canal shares, which in 1902 were alone worth upwards 
of £26,000,000. (H. Ch.) 

British National Debt Conversions. — The great bulk of the 
funded debt of the United Kingdom consists of annuities, which 
are described as perpetual, because the state is under no obliga- 
tion to pay off at any time the capital debt which they represent. 
All that the public creditor can claim is to receive payment of 
the instalments of annuity as they fall due. On the other hand, 
the government has the right to redeem the annuities ultimately 
by payment of the capital debt; though it may, and frequently 
does, bind itself not to exercise that right as regards a particular 
stock of annuities until after a definite period. So long as a 
stock is thus guaranteed against redemption, the only way in 
which the annual charge for that portion of the debt can be 
reduced is by the government buying back the annuities in the 
open market at their current price, which may be more or may 
be less than the nominal debt, according to general financial 
conditions and to the state of the national credit. The liability 
of the stock to redemption at par, when the period of guarantee 
has expired, prevents its market price from rising materially 
above that level. To enable the right of compulsory redemption 
to be enforced, it is only necessary that the government should

value of terminable annuities and minor treasury operations.

have command of sufficient funds for the purpose of paying off 
the stockholders, or should be able to raise those funds by 
borrowing at a rate of interest lower then that borne by the 
stock. Any circumstances which might tend to raise the price 
of the stock above par would also assist the government in 
raising its redemption money on more favourable terms. When 
the amount of stock to be dealt with is large, the raising by a 
fresh loan of the amount required for redemption would occasion 
great disturbance. A more convenient method is the conversion 
of the existing stock to a lower rate of interest by agreement 
with the stockholders, whose reluctance to accept a reduction 
of income is overborne by their knowledge that the power of 
redemption exists and will be put in force if necessary. The 
opportunity for conversion may be looked for when the price of a 
redeemable stock stands steadily at or barely above par. Observa- 
tion of the movements* in the price of other securities will serve 
to show whether this stationary price represents the real market 
value of the stock, or whether that value is subject to depression 
owing to an expectation of the stock being converted or redeemed. 
Accordingly, the course of prices of other government stocks 
which are free from the liability to redemption, of the stocks of 
foreign countries and the colonies, and of the large municipalities, 
must be watched by government in order to determine, first, 
whether the conversion of a redeemable stock is feasible, and, 
secondly, to what extent the reduction of the interest in the 
stock may be carried. 

The credit for the first measure of conversion belongs to Walpole, 
though it was carried through by Stanhope, his successor as chan- 
cellor of the exchequer. In 1714 the legal rate of interest 
1717* for. private transactions, which had been fixed at 6% 

in the year of the Restoration, was reduced to 5% by the act 12 
Anne, stat. 2, c. 16, But the bulk of the national debt still bore 
interest at 6%, the doubtful security of the throne and the too 
frequent irregularities in public payment having hitherto precluded 
any considerable borrowing at lower rates. Walpole saw that the 
first requirement was to give increased confidence to the public 
creditors. Three acts were passed dealing respectively with debts 
due to the general public, to the Bank of England and to the South 
Sea Company. Three separate funds — the general fund, the aggre- 
gate fund and the South Sea fund — were assigned to the service 
of the several classes of debt, each of these funds being credited 
with the produce of specified taxes, which were made permanent 
for the purpose; and it was further provided that any surplus of 
the funds, after payment of the interest of the debts, should be 
applied in reduction of the principal. Such was the success of this 
measure that, in spite of the reduction of interest from 6 to 5% 
which was also enacted, the passing of the acts was followed by a 
rise in the price of stocks. A curious preliminary to the introduction 
of these measures was the passing 01 a resolution by the House of 
Commons, which invited advances not exceeding £600,000, to be 
repaid with interest at 4% out of the first supplies of the year. 
The result showed that the time was not ripe for such a reduction 
of interest, as only a sum of £45,000 was offered on those terms. A 
further resolution was then passed, substituting 5% as the rate of 
interest, and the whole sum was at once subscribed. Besides accept- 
ing the reduction of interest on their own debts, the Bank of England 
and the South Sea Company agreed to assist the government by 
advancing 4J millions at the reduced rate, to be employed in paying 
off any of the general creditors who might refuse assent to the con- 
version. The assistance was not required, as all the creditors 
signified assent. The debts thus dealt with amounted altogether 
to about 25J millions, and the annual saving of interest effected 
(including that upon a large quantity of exchequer bills for which 
the Bank had been receiving over 7 %) was £329,000. 

Walpole had a further opportunity of effecting a conversion in 
1737* In the meantime much of the 5% debt had been reduced to 
1749 4% by arrangements with the Bank of England and the 

South Sea Company, and further borrowings had taken 
place at that rate and even at 3%. In 1737 the 3% stood above 
par, and Sir John Barnard proposed to the House of Commons a 
scheme for the gradual reduction of the 4 %. As a financial measure 
the scheme would doubtless have succeeded; but Walpole, moved 
apparently by consideration for his capitalist supporters, opposed 
and for the time defeated it. A scheme on similar lines was carried 
through by Pelham as chancellor of the exchequer in 1 749 and em- 
bodied in the act 23 Geo. II. c. 1. By that act holders of the 4% 
securities, amounting to nearly £58,000,000, were offered a con- 
tinuance of interest at 4% for one year, followed by 3!% for seven 
years, during which they were guaranteed against redemption, with 
a final reduction to 3% thereafter. It was necessary to continue 
the rate of 4 %^ for the first year, as any objecting stockholders 
could not belaid off without a year's notice. Three months were 
allowed for signifying assent to the proposal. At first it was viewed 



with disfavour, and both the Bank and the East India Company 
opposed it. But the pens of the government pamphleteers were 
busily occupied in showing the advantages of the offer, and at the 
close of the three months acceptances had been received from the 
holders of nearly £39,000,000 of the stocks, or more than two-thirds 
of the whole. A further opportunity was afforded to waverers by a 
second act (23 Geo. II. c. 22), which allowed three months more for 
consideration; but for holders accepting under this act the inter- 
mediate period of 3§ % interest was reduced from seven years to 
five. These terms brought in an additional £15,600,000 of stock; 
and the balance left outstanding, amounting to less thanj 3 \ millions, 
was paid off at par by means of a new loan. The annual saving of 
interest on the stock converted was at first £272,000, increasing to 
£544,000 after seven years. 

For nearly three-quarters of a century no further conversion was 
attempted. In that period the total debt had been increased tenfold, 
and the practice of borrowing in times of war by the issue 
of an inflated capital, bearing nominally a low rate of tS22% 

interest, prevented recourse to conversion as a means of reducing 
the burden after peace was restored. But in 1822 Mr Vansittart — 
who four years earlier had effected a conversion in the opposite 
direction, turning £27,000,000 of stock from 3 inio 3! %, in order to 
obtain from the holders an advance of £3,000,000 without adding to 
the capital of the debt — was able to deal with the 5 %. These stocks 
amounted to £152,000,000 out of a total funded debt of £795,000,000. 
The prices at which the chief denominations of government stocks 
stood in the market in the early part of 1822 indicated a normal rate 
of interest ot more than 4 but considerably less than 4!%. In these 
circumstances, to propose the conversion of the 5 % stocks to 4§ % 
would probably have been futile, unless the new stock were guaran- 
teed for a long period, as holders would have stood in fear of a 
speedy further reduction. Nor could the government hope to suc- 
ceed in a reduction to 4%. Mr Vansittart's plan was to offer £105 
of stock bearing 4 % in exchange for £100 of 5 % stock, thus adding 
slightly tojthe capital of the debt, but effecting a large annual saving 
in interest. These terms were highly successful. Holders of nearly 
£150,000,000 accepted, leaving less than £3,000,000 of the stock to 
be paid off, and the annual saving obtained was £1,197,000. The 
new 4 % stock was made irredeemable for seven years (act 3, Geo. 
IV c-9). 

There were, however, other 4% stocks, amounting to £76,000,000, 
which were not secured against redemption. Two years later, the 
conditions being favourable for their conversion, the act 
5 Geo. IV. c. 2^. was passed, offering holders in exchange 
a 3I % stock, irredeemable for five years. The offer was accepted 
as regards £70,000,000, and^ the remaining £6,000,000 paid off, the 
annual saving on interest being £381,000. 

In 1830 the guarantee given to the 4% stock of 1822 had expired, 
and the stock stood at a price of 102 }. Mr Goulbum decided to 
attempt its conversion without delay, and accordingly by 
the act n Geo. IV. c. 13 holders were offered in exchange 'S30, 

for each £100 of the stock, either £100 of a 3!% stock, irredeemable 
for ten years, or £70 of a 5 % stock, irredeemable for forty-two years, 
these two options being considered of approximately equal value. 
No difficulty was found in securing assent. Over £150,000,000 of the 
stock was converted, almost wholly into the 3!% stock; the balance 
of less than £3,000,000 was paid on, and an annual saving of £754,000 
in interest was the result. 

It was again Mr Goulburn's fortune to carry out a large and 
successful conversion in 1844. At that date the funded debt was 
made up of 3% and $h% stocks in the proportions of 
about two to one, the only other denomination being the ,S44 * 

trifling amount of 5% stock created in connexion with the conver- 
sion of 1830. The price of 3% consols ranged about 98, and that 
of the new 3i%, created in 1830, about 102. A reduction straight- 
way from 3i to 3 % was not to be looked^ for, but it was hoped to 
ensure that reduction ultimately by offering 3} % for the first few 
years and a guarantee against redemption for a long term. Accord- 
ingly the holders of the^ several 3^% stocks were offered an exchange 
to a new stock bearing interest at 3} % for ten years and at 3 % for 
the following twenty years. Practically the whole of the stock, 
amounting to £249,000,000, was converted on these terms, only 
£1 03,000 being left to be paid off at par. The immediate saving of 
interest was £622,000 a year for ten years, and twice that rate in 
subsequent years (acts 7 & 8 Vict. cc. 4 and 5). 

Mr Gladstone's only attempt at the conversion of the debt was 
made in his first year as chancellor of the exchequer. His primary 
purpose was to extinguish some small remnants of 3% 
stocks which stood outside the main stocks of that de- *** 

nomination. The act 16 Vict. c. 23 offered to holders of these 
minor stocks, amounting altogether to about 9} millions, the option 
of exchanging every £100 for either £82, ios. of a 3i % stock guaran- 
teed for 40 years, or £1 10 of a 2 J % stock guaranteed for the same 
period, or else for exchequer bonds at par. In the result stock to the 
amount of only about £1,500,000 was converted, and the remaining 
£8,000,000 had to be paid off at par, with some apparent loss of 
capital, as the current market price of the 3 % was less than par. 
The failure w?s largely owing to the fact that, between the initiation 
and the execution of the scheme, the train of events leading up to 
the Crimean War had become manifest, with unfavourable results

to the public credit. Mr Gladstone had also included, as an optional 
portion of his plan, liberty to holders of the larger 3% stocks to 
exchange into the new 3J and 2\%. Very little advantage was 
taken of this permission, but the small amount of 2j% stock then 
created has been largely added to in later years by the conversion 
of stocks of higher denominations held by the national debt com- 
missioners for the savings banks and other government funds. 

Little better was the result of a more ambitious attempt made by 
Mr Childers in 1884. His offer (act 47 & 48 Vict. c. 23) extended 
1884 t0 tne holders °f a ^ tne 3% stocks, amounting to more 

than 600 millions, but no attempt was made to compel 
acceptance. There was offered in exchange for each £100 of 3% 
stock either £102 of a stock at 2 J % or £108 of a stock at 2 J %, both 
irredeemable for twenty-one years. But the amount exchanged 
into the new stocks was only 22 millions, of which more than one- 
half was stock held by government departments. 

The most important of all the conversions of the British debt was 
effected by Mr Goschen in 1888. It applied to the whole of the 3 % 
1888* stocks, amounting to a total of £558,000,000, made up as 

follows: £323,000,000 of consols, a stock which dated 
from 1752, when it was formed by the consolidation of a number of 
minor stocks; £69,000,000 of reduced 3%, of which the nucleus 
was the stock reduced from 4 to 3% by Pelham's conversion in 
1749; £166,000,000 of new 3% resulting from the conversion of 
1844. All the three stocks were, and had been for a considerable 
time, well over par. But for the past few years they had remained 
in almost a stationary position, relatively to the upward movement 
shown in the prices of the government 2§% stock, and of the stocks 
of foreign governments, of British colonies and of the leading munici- 
palities. It was clear that the anticipation of a conversion or re- 
demption scheme was weighing down consols. Direct evidence of 
this fact was afforded by the course of a new 3% stock, the local 
loans stock, which Mr Goschen had created in 1887. Though bearing 
the same interest and resting upon the same ultimate security as 
consols, this stock, which had been made irredeemable for twenty- 
five years, rose at once to a higher level of price. The opportunity 
for a great scheme of conversion had evidently come. The risk to 
be incurred by government in undertaking the liability to Day off 
such an enormous body of stock, though less in comparison with the 
resources of the nation than that which Mr Goulburn had faced in 
1844, was still very great, and it was rendered more formidable by 
the fact that holders of consols and of reduced 3 % were entitled 
at law to a year's notice before their stocks could be redeemed. 
If that right of notice were to be enforced as regards any large pro- 
portion of the stocks, no precaution could adequately guard against 
the risk of untoward^ circumstances arising to affect the operation 
before the year expired. Mr Goschen proposed to offer to the 
holders of each of the three stocks an exchange at par into a new 
stock bearing interest at 3% for the first year, at 2j% for the next 
fourteen years and at 2^% for twenty years thereafter, the stock 
to be irredeemable for the whole of that period, namely till 1923. 
Acceptance was made compulsory for holders of the new 3 %, with 
the alternative of being paid off at par, as they had no claim to 
receive notice ; but it was- made optional for the holders of the other 
two stocks, and a bonus of 5s. % was offered to them as an induce- 
ment to forgo their right of notice. These provisions were duly 
embodied in the act 51 Vict. c. 2. The terms were accepted by 
practically all the holders of the new 3 % and by the great majority 
of the holders in consols and reduced 3 s, the amount left outstanding 
being only £42,000,000. To enable that balance to be dealt with, an 
act was passed providing for the compulsory redemption or conver- 
sion of the outstanding stock at the expiry of the statutory notice. 
The funds required for this further operation were raised by the 
issue of treasury bills and exchequer bonds, by temporary advances 
from the bank and from the national debt commissioners, and by the 
creation of an additional half-million of the new stock. In the 
result it was only necessary to find cash for paying off dissentients 
to the_ amount of £19,000,000. The final outcome of the whole 
operation was a saving in the annual charge of interest of £1,412,000, 
increasing to twice that amount after fourteen years. 

The conversion of the consols and reduced 3% was greatly 
facilitated by^ the exercise of a power, which the act conferred, to 
pay to recognized agents, such as stockbrokers, bankers and solicitors, 
a commission of is. 6d. % on stocks in respect of which they lodged 
their clients' assents. These agents were thus afforded an induce- 
ment to give their clients explanation and advice, without which 
many of the fundholders would probably not have moved in the 
matter. The commissions paid amounted to more than £234,000, 
representing stocks to the amount of over £312,000,000. The 
government^ would not again be confronted with this difficulty of 
Raving to give long preliminary notice of the intention to convert 
or redeem a large portion of the debt, as it was provided by the 
Conversion Act 1 888 that the present consols should be redeemable 
after 1923 on such notice and in such manner as parliament might 
direct. (W. Bl.; E. W. H.*)

NATIONALITY, a somewhat vague term, used strictly in 
international law (see International Law, Private) for the 
status of membership in a nation or state (for the conditions of 
which see State, Allegiance, Naturalization, Alien), and 
in a more extended sense in political discussion to denote an 
aggregation of persons claiming'to represent a racial, territorial 
or some other bond of unity, though not necessarily recognized 
as an independent political entity. In this latter sense the word 
has often been applied to such people as the Irish, the Armenians 
and the Czechs. A " nationality " in this connexion represents 
a common feeling and an organized claim rather than distinct 
attributes which can be comprised in a strict definition. 

NATIONAL WORKSHOPS (Fr. Ateliers Nationaux), the term 
applied to the workshops established to provide work for the 
unemployed by the French provisional government after the 
revolution of 1848. 1 The political crisis which resulted in the 
abdication of Louis Philippe was naturally followed, in Paris, 
by an acute industrial crisis, and this, following the general 
agricultural and commercial distress which had prevailed through- 
out 1847, rendered the problem of unemployment in Paris very 
acute. The provisional government under the influence of one of 
its members, Louis Blanc, and on the demand of a deputation 
claiming to represent the people passed a decree (Feb. 25, 
1848) from which the following is an extract: — 

The provisional government of the French Republic undertakes 
to guarantee the existence of the workmen by work. It undertakes 
to guarantee work for every citizen. 

For the carrying out of this decree, Louis Blanc wanted the 
formation of a ministry of labour, but this was shelved by his 
colleagues, who as a compromise appointed a government labour 
Commission, under the presidency of Louis Blanc, with power of 
inquiry and consultation only. The carrying out of the decree 
of Feb. 25th was entrusted to the minister of public works, 
M. Marie, and various public works 2 were immediately started. 
The earlier stages of the national works are sufficiently interesting 
to justify the following detailed account: — 

11 The workman first of all obtained a certificate from the landlord 
of his house, or furnished apartments, showing his address, whether 
in Paris or the department of the Seine. This certificate was vis£d 
and stamped by the police commissary of the district. The work- 
man then repaired to the office of the maire of his ward, and, on 
delivering this document, received in exchange a note of admission 
to the national works, bearing his name, residence and calling, and 
enabling him to be received by the director of the workplaces in 
which vacancies existed. All went well while the number of the un- 
employed was less than 6000, but as soon as that number was 
exceeded the workmen of each arrondissement, after having visited 
all the open works in succession without result, returned to their 
maire's offices tired, starving and discontented. The workmen had 
been promised bread when work was not to be had, which was reason- 
able and charitable; the great mistake was, however, then committed 
of giving them money, and distributing it in public at the offices of 
the maires instead of distributing assistance in kind, which might 
have been done so easily through the agency of the bureaux de bien- 
faisance. Each maire s office was authorized to pay every un- 
employed workman 1 -50 f rs. per day on production^ of a ticket 
showing that there was no vacancy for him in the national works. 
The fixed sum of 2 francs was paid to any workman engaged on the 
public excavation work, without regard to his age, the work done 
or his calling. . „ . The workman made the following simple calcu- 
lation, and he made it aloud: * The state gives me 30 sous for doing 
nothing, it pays me 40 sous when I work, so I need only work to the 
extent of 10 sous.' This was logical. . . . 

11 The works opened by the minister of public works being far 
distant from each other, and the workmen not being able to visit 
them all in turn to make certain that there were no vacancies for 
them, two central bureaux were established, one at the Halle-aux- 
Veaux under M. Wissocq, the other near the maire's office in the 

x The term is also incorrectly applied to the proposed ateliers 
sociauxoi Louis Blanc (g.fl.), state-supported co-operative productive 
societies.

5th arrondissement in the Rue'de Bondy, entrusted to M. Higonnet. 
. . . The workmen went to have their tickets examined at one of 
these bureaux; and the absence of employment having been 
proved, they returned to get their 30 sous at their maires' offices/' 1 

Owing to the increase in the number of those claiming work or 
relief, disorganization set in, and both the bureaux and the 
maires became the centres of disturbances, those in charge of the 
offices being unable to control the crowds. As a consequence 
M. Marie commissioned fimile Thomas, a chemist connected 
with the ficole Centrale to reorganize the works. When Thomas 
took the work in hand on the 5th of March, the number of 
unemployed had increased to 14,000 in addition to some 4000 
or 5000 employed on public works, and it was steadily on the 
increase. On the 16th of March the daily pay of the workmen 
who were not working was reduced to 1 franc; work was 
guaranteed for at least every other day, in which case the pay 
was to be 2 francs for the day. The possible usefulness of this 
order was stultified by the near approach of the elections, 
the moderate and extreme sections both trying to exploit the 
•dissatisfied workmen. Private industry, too, was paralysed, 
the workpeople for the most part preferring 1 franc a day and 
idleness, with the possibility of future benefits. Thomas, left 
practically to his own resources, endeavoured to organize some 
special workshops where artisans could be employed at their own 
trades; but it was found almost impossible to persuade them 
to do serious work, as they knew that many of their fellows 
were being paid for loafing. On the 19th of May the number 
enrolled had increased to 87,942. The National Assembly had 
in the meanwhile been elected, and met on the 4th of May. The 
Executive Commission was elected a few days later; Louis Blanc 
was excluded, but all the other members of the provisional 
government were on it. Blanc renewed his motion for a ministry 
of labour; this was rejected. On the 15th the mob invaded the 
Assembly, and from that time the government abated their 
socialist tendencies, and cast about for means to put an end to 
what had become a serious danger to the state as well as an 
exhausting drain on the treasury. On the 24th of May Thomas 
received instructions to dismiss all unmarried men under 25 
years of age who would not enlist in the army, all men who could 
not prove six months' residence in Paris, and all who refused offers 
of private employment. Piece-work was to be established instead 
of time-work, and men were to be prepared to be drafted into the 
provinces. Thomas foretold trouble as a consequence of the 
order, and it was for a time withdrawn. On the 26th of May 
Thomas was superseded by M. Lalanne, and on the 30th the 
National Assembly decreed the substitution of piece-work for 
time-work. On the 20th of June the remainder of the proposals 
were approved, and the sequel was the insurrection of the 23rd 
of June and following days (see French History). How far 
the real socialistic scheme of Louis Blanc would have been 
successful if it had been put in practice must remain a matter of 
speculation. It was entered upon hastily, without any organiza- 
tion, was looked upon coldly by those servants of the govern- 
ment who ought to have assisted it, and, in the circumstances, 
was foredoomed to failure from the start.

NATROLITE, a mineral species belonging to the zeolite group. 
It is a hydratcd sodium and aluminium silicate with the formula 
Na2Al2Si30io*2H 2 0, and containing sodium (Na20, 16-3%), 
was named natrolite by M. H. Klaproth in 1803. " Needle- 
stone " or " needle- zeolite " are other names, alluding to the 
common acicular habit of the crystals, which are often very 
slender and are aggregated in divergent tufts. Larger crystals 
have the form of a square prism terminated by a low pyramid : 
the prism angle being nearly a right angle (88° 4$¥), tne crystals 
are tetragonal in appearance, though actually orthorhombic. 
There are perfect cleavages parallel to the faces of the prism. 
1 E. Thomas, Histoire des ateliers nationaux, p. 29. 



The mineral also often occurs in compact fibrous aggregates, 
the fibres having a divergent or radial arrangement (hence the 
name radiolite for one variety). From other fibrous zeolites 
natrolite is readily distinguished by its optical characters: 
between crossed nicols the fibres extinguish parallel to .their 
length, and they do not show an optic figure in convergent 
polarized light. Natrolite is usually white or colourless, but some- 
times reddish or yellowish. The lustre is vitreous, or in finely 
fibrous specimens sometimes silky. The spec. grav. is 2-2, 
and the hardness 5^. The mineral is readily fusible, melting in 
a candle-flame, to which it imparts a yellow colour owing to the 
presence of sodium. It is decomposed by hydrochloric acid 
with separation of gelatinous silica. 

Natrojite occurs with other zeolites in the amygdaloidal cavities 
of basic igneous rocks. The best specimens are the diverging groups 
of white prismatic crystals found in compact basalt at the Puy-ae- 
Marman, Puy-de D6me, France. The largest crystals are those from 
Brevig in Norway. The walls of cavities in the basalt of the Giant's 
Causeway, in Co. Antrim, are frequently encrusted with slender 
needles of natrolite, and similar material is found abundantly in the 
volcanic rocks (basalt and phonolite) of Salesel, Aussig and several 
other places in the north of Bohemia. 

Several varieties of natrolite have been distinguished by special 
names. Fargite is a red natrolite from Glenfarg in Perthshire. 
Bergmannite or Spreustein is an impure variety which has resulted 
by the alteration of other minerals, chiefly sodalite, in the augite- 
syenite of southern Norway. 

NATTIER, JEAN MARC (1685-1766), French painter, was 
born in Paris in 1 685, the son of Marc Nattier, a portrait painter, 
and of Marie Court ois, a miniaturist. He received his first 
instruction from his father, and having applied himself to copying 
pictures at the Luxembourg Gallery, he refused to proceed to 
the French Academy in Rome, though he had taken the first 
prize at the Paris Academy at the age of fifteen. In 171 5 he 
went to Amsterdam, where Peter the Great was then staying, 
and painted portraits of the tsar and the empress Catherine, but 
declined an offer to go to Russia. Between 17 15 and 1720 he 
devoted himself to compositions like the " Battle of Pultawa," 
which he painted for Peter the Great, and the " Petrification of 
Phineus and of his Companions," which led to his election to 
the Academy. The financial collapse of 1720 caused by the 
schemes of Law all but ruined Nattier, who found himself forced 
to devote his whole energy to portraiture. He became the 
painter of the artificial ladies of Louis XYVs court. The most 
notable examples of his straightfprward portraiture are the 
" Marie Leczinska " at the Dijon Museum, and a group of the 
artist surrounded by his family, dated 1730. He died in Paris 
in 1 766. Many of his pictures are in the public collections of 
France. Thus at the Louvre is his " Magdalen "; at Nantes the 
portrait of " La Camargo " and " A Lady of the Court of Louis 
XV." At Orleans a " Head of a Young Girl," at Marseilles a 
portrait of " Mme de Pompadour," at Perpignan a portrait of 
"'Louis XV., " and at Valenciennes a portrait of " Le Due de 
BoufHers." The Versailles Museum owns an important group of 
two ladies, and the Dresden Gallery a portrait of the " Marechal 
de Saxe." At the Wallace collection Nattier is represented by 
" The Comtesse de Dillieres," " The Bath (Mdlle de Clermont)," 
" Portrait of a Lady in Blue," " Marie Leczinska " and " A 
Prince of the House of France." In the collection of Mr Lionel 
Phillips are the duchess of Flavacourt as " Le Silence" and the 
duchess of Chateauroux as " Le Point du jour" A portrait of 
the " Comtesse de Neubourg and her Daughter " formed part 
of the Vaile Collection, and realized 4500 gs. at the sale of this 
collection in 1903. Nattier's works have been engraved by 
Leroy, Tardieu, Lepicie, Audran, Dupin and many other noted 
craftsmen.

above sea-level, is the great natural curiosity from which it 
derives its name — a bridge of natural rock 90 ft. long and from 
50 to 150 ft. wide, which spans Cedar Creek at a height of 215 ft. 
above that stream. It consists of horizontal limestone strata, 
and is the remains of the roof of a cave or underground tunnel 
through which the creek once flowed. It is crossed by a public 
road. In the village are magnesia and Iithia springs and a salt- 
petre cave, which was worked during the War of 18 12 and the 
Civil War. A royal grant dated the 5th of July 1774 conveyed to 
Thomas Jefferson a tract of 157 acres, " including the Natural 
Bridge on Cedar Creek," and it did not pass from his estate until 

1833. 

NATURAL GAS, the name given to the inflammable gas occur- 
ring in petroliferous formations. It consists mainly of hydro- 
carbons of the paraffin series, principally marsh gas, which 
constitutes from 50 to 90 % of the Pennsylvanian gas. Members 
of the olefine series are also present, especially in the gas of Baku. 
Varying amounts of carbon dioxide, sometimes as much as 10% 
or more, and small quantities of carbon monoxide, nitrogen, 
hydrogen and oxygen are also found. For particulars of the 
geological occurrence, and the collection and distribution, of 
natural gas, see Petroleum. 

NATURALISM. " Nature " is a term of very uncertain 
extent, and the " natural " has accordingly several antitheses, 
often more or less conflicting, and only to be learnt from the 
context in which they occur. Thus, though Man and the World 
are often opposed as respectively subject and object, yet the 
word nature is applied to both: hence Naturalism is used in 
both a subjective and an objective sense. In the subjective 
sense the natural, as the original or essential, is opposed to what 
is acquired, artificial, conventional or accidental. On this 
opposition the casuistry and paradoxes of the Sophists largely 
turned; it determined also, at least negatively, the conduct of 
the Cynics in their contempt for the customary duties and 
decencies; and it led the Stoics to seek positive rules of life in 
" conformity to nature." This deference for the " natural " 
generally, and distrust of traditional systems of thought and 
«ven of traditional institutions, has played a large part in 
modern philosophy, especially British philosophy. It was 
perhaps the inevitable outcome of the reaction, which began 
with the Renaissance, against the medieval domination of mere 
authority. " L'homme qui medite est un animal depraveV' 
said Rousseau; and again, " Tout est bien sortant des mains de 
Fauteur des choses,tout degenere entre les mains de Fhomme." 1 
' In psychology and epistemology, " no one," as Green has said, 
" is more emphatic than Locke in opposing what is real to what 
we ' make for ourselves ' — the work of nature to the work of the 
mind. Simple ideas or sensations we certainly do not ' make 
for ourselves.' They therefore, and matter supposed to cause 
them, are, according to Locke, real. But relations are neither 
simple ideas nor their material archetypes. They therefore, 
as Locke explicitly holds, fall under the head of the work of the 
mind, which is opposed to the real." 2 This opposition again led 
Hume, in the first place, to distinguish between natural and 
philosophical relations — the former determined simply by associa- 
tion, the latter by an abitrary union of two ideas, which we 
may think proper tc compare — and then, in the next, to reduce 
identity and causality, the two chief " philosophical relations," 
to fictions resulting from " natural relations," that i%to say, from 
associations of similarity and contiguity. Subjective naturalism 
thus tended to become, and in the end became, what is more 
commonly called Sensationalism or Associationism, thereby 
approximating towards that objective naturalism which reduces 
the external world to a mechanism describable in terms of matter 
and motion — a result already foreshadowed when Hartley 
connected ideas and their association with brain vibrations and 
vibratiuncles. In ethics, also, the striving to get back to the 
natural entailed a similar downward trend. From the Cambridge 
Platonists, from Locke and Clarke, we hear much of rational 

1 Quoted by Eisler, Worterbuch der philosophischen Begriffe (1899), 
s.v. " NaturaHsmus." 

* T. H. Green, Prolegomena to Ethics (1883), § 20. 



principles of conduct, comparable in respect of intelligibility 
with the truths of mathematics; but already we find that in 
Shaftesbury the centre of ethical interest is transferred from the 
Reason, conceived as apprehending either abstract moral dis- 
tinctions or laws of divine legislation, to the " natural affections " 
that prompt to social duty; 3 and when we reach Bentham, 
with pleasure and pain as " sovereign masters," and the Mills, 
with love of virtue explained by the laws of association, all 
seems to be non-rational. 4 There is much resemblance, as well 
as some historical connexion, between the naturalism of moralists 
such as Shaftesbury and Hutcheson and the Common-Sense 
metaphysics of Reid and his school. 6 Hence Kant, distinguishing 
between a " naturalistic " and " scientific " or critical method 
in metaphysics, styles Reid and his followers " naturalists of pure 
reason," satirically comparing them to people who think they can 
settle the size and distance of the moon by direct eyesight better 
than by the roundabout calculations of mathematics. 

So far we have seen the natural approximating to the non- 
rational. But when used in a subjective sense in opposition to 
the supernatural, it means the rational as opposed to what is 
above reason, or even contrary to reason. It is in this sense that 
the term Naturalism most frequently occurs; and it was so 
applied specially to the doctrines of the English Deists and the 
German Illuminati of the 17th and 18th centuries: those of 
them who held that human reason alone was capable of attaining 
to the knowledge of God were called theological naturalists 
or rationalists, while those who denied the possibility of revela- 
tion altogether were called philosophical naturalists or naturalists 
simply. 6 In these controversies the term Naturalist was also 
sometimes used in an objective sense for those who identified 
God and Nature, but they were more frequently styled Spinozists, 
Pantheists or even Atheists. But it is at once obvious that 
dispute as to what is natural and what supernatural is vain and 
hopeless till the meanings of reason and nature are clearly defined. 
" The onlydistinct meaning of the word " [natural], said Butler, 
" is stated, fixed or settled; since what is natural as much requires 
and presupposes an intelligent agent to render it so, i.e. to effect 
it continually, or at stated times, as what is supernatural or 
miraculous does to effect it for once. And from hence it must 
follow that persons' notion of what is natural will be enlarged 
in proportion to their greater knowledge. . . . Nor is there any 
absurdity in supposing that there may he beings in the universe, 
whose capacities . . . may be so extensive, as that the whole 
Christian dispensation may to them appear natural, i.e. analogous 
or conformable to God's dealings with other parts of His creation; 
as natural as the visible known course of things appears to us." 7 

The antithesis of natural to spiritual (or ideal) has mainly 
determined the use of the term Naturalism in the present 
day.^ But current naturalism is not to be called materialism, 
though these terms are often used synonymously, as by Hegel, 
Ueberweg and other historians of philosophy; nor yet pan- 
theism, if by that is meant the immanence of all things in one 
God. We know only material phenomena, it is said; matter is 
an abstract conception simply, not a substantial reality. It is 
therefore meaningless to describe mind as its effect.. Moreover, 
mind also is but an abstract conception; and here again all 
our knowledge is confined to the phenomenal. To identify the 
two classes of phenomena is, however, impossible, and indeed 
absurd; nevertheless we find a constant concomitance of 
psychosis and neurosis; and the more sensationalist and associa- 
tionist our psychology, the easier it becomes to correlate the

8 In aesthetics we find Naturalism used in a cognate sense: the 
Flemish painters, such writers as Flaubert or Zola, for example, being 
called naturalistic or realistic, in contrast to the Italian painters or 
writers like George Sand or the Brontes. 



NATURALIZATION 



275 



psychical and the physical as but " two aspects " of one and the 
same fact. It is therefore simplest and sufficient to assume an 
underlying, albeit unknown, unity connecting the two. A 
monism — so far neutral, neither materialistic nor spiritualistic — 
is thus a characteristic of the prevailing naturalism. But when 
the question arises, how best to systematize experience as a 
whole, it is contended that we must begin from the physical side. 
Here we have precise conceptions, quantitative exactness and 
thoroughgoing continuity; every thought that has ever stirred 
the hearts of men, not less than every breeze that has ever 
rippled the face of the deep, has meant a perfectly definite re- 
distribution of matter and motion. To the mechanical principles 
of this redistribution an ultimate analysis brings us down; 
and — beginning from these — the nebular hypothesis and the 
theory of natural selection will enable us to explain all subsequent 
synthesis. 1 Life and mind now clearly take a secondary place; 
the cosmical mechanism determines them, while they are powerless 
to modify it. The spiritual becomes the " epiphenomenal," a 
merely incidental phosphorescence, so to say, that regularly 
accompanies physical processes of a certain type and complexity. 
(See also Psychology.) 

This absolute naturalism, as we may call it, the union, that 
is, of psychological and cosmolegical naturalism, is in fact a 
species of Fatalism, as Kant indeed entitled it. 2 It is the logical 
outcome of a sensationalist psychology, and of the epistemology 
which this entails. As long as association of ideas (or sensory 
residua) is held to explain judgment and conscience, so long may 
naturalism stand. 

The naturalistic work of chief account at the present day is 
E. Haeckel's Die Weltratsel, gemeinverstandtiche Studien fiber 
monistische Philosophie (5th ed., 1900), of which an English trans- 
lation has appeared. Effective refutations will be found in the works 
of two of Haeckel's colleagues, O. Liebmann, Zur Analysis der 
Wirklichkeit (3rd ed., 1900) ; R. Eucken, Die Einheit des Geisteslebens 
in Bewusstsein und That der Menschheit (1888, Eng. trans.); Der 
Kampf um einen geisligen Lebensinhalt (1898). See also A. J. 
Balfour, Foundations of Belief (8th ed., 1901); J. Ward, Naturalism 
and Agnosticism (1899). (J. W.*) 

NATURALIZATION, the term given in law to the acquisition 
by an alien of the national character or citizenship of a certain 
state, always with the consent of that state and of himself, 
but not necessarily with the consent of the state to which he 
previously belonged, which may refuse to its subjects the right 
of renouncing its nationality, called il expatriation," or may 
allow the right only on conditions which have not been fulfilled 
in the particular case. Hence although nationality in strict 
theory is always single, as liege homage was and allegiance in its 
proper sense is, it often happens that two states claim the same 
person as their national or subject. This conflict arises not only 
from naturalization having, been granted without the corre- 
sponding expatriation having been permitted, but also from the 
fact that birth on the soil was the leading determinant of nation- 
ality by feudal law, and still is so by the laws of England and the 
United States (jus soli), while the nationality of the father is its 
leading determinant in those countries which have accepted 
Roman principles of jurisprudence (jus sanguinis). The conflict 
is usually solved for practical purposes by an understanding 
which is approximately general, namely that, in cases not pro- 
vided for by treaty, no state shall protect those whom it claims 
as its nationals while residing in the territory of another state 
which claims them as its own nationals by any title, whether 
jus soli, jus sanguinis, naturalization, or the refusal to allow 
expatriation. On this footing the British foreign office, while 
it grants passports for travel to naturalized persons, will extend 
no protection to them against a claim of their former country, if 
they return to it, to exact military service due to it. The United 
States, asserting that expatriation is an inalienable right of man, 
maintains that, to lose his right to American protection, the 
emigrant who has been naturalized in the United States must 
have done that for which he might have been tried and punished 
at the moment of his departure; it claims to protect him against 
the exaction of what at that moment was merely a future liability 

1 Cf. Spencer, First Principles (1867), p. 398. 

1 Cf. Prolegomena, § 60. 



to military service, and this doctrine has been practically accepted 
by France in her dealings with America. Germany also accepted 
it by the treaty of 1868 between the United States and the 
North German Confederation, now in force for the German 
empire, subject to provisions that the emigrant's fixing his 
domicile in the old country shall be deemed a renunciation 
of his naturalization in the new, and that his living in the old 
country for more than two years may be deemed to imply the 
absence of an intention to return to the new. Between the 
United States and Great Britain the convention of the 13th of 
May 1870 provides that naturalization in either is to be valid 
for all purposes immediately on its completion, but that if the 
resident shall renew his residence in his old country he may be 
readmitted to his old nationality, on his application and on such 
conditions as the readmitting government may impose. 

The Naturalization Act 1870, which now governs the matter 
for England, does not say that the person naturalized becomes 
thereby a British subject, to which, if it had been said, a proviso 
might have been added saving the above-mentioned policy of 
the foreign office as to not protecting him in his old country, 
although even without such a proviso the foreign office would 
have been free to follow that policy. The act in question (s. 7) 
gives him the rights and imposes on him the duties of a natural- 
born British subject in the United Kingdom, and provides that, 
when within the limits of his old country, he shall not be deemed 
a British subject unless he has ceased to be a subject of that 
country, by its laws or in pursuance of a treaty. On this wording 
it has been maintained that British naturalization is not really 
naturalization at all; but leaves the naturalized person as he 
was with the addition of a certain quality within the United 
Kingdom; and on that ground it has been considered in France 
that a Frenchman, obtaining naturalization in England, does not 
fall within the French law (Code Civil, Art. 17) which pronounces 
the expatriation of citizens who cause themselves to be naturalized 
abroad. This is the Bourgoise Case, 41 Ch. D. 310, in which, 
when it came before the English courts, Mr Justice Kay inclined 
to the same view, but the court of appeal avoided giving an 
opinion on the point. Professor Dicey leans to the same view 
(5 Law Quarterly Review, 438) ; but Sir Thomas Barclay (4 L.Q.R. 
226), Sir Malcolm Mcllwraith (6 L.Q.R. 379), and Professor West- 
lake ' (International Law — Peace, 2nd ed. p. 234; Private Inter- 
national Law, 4th ed. p. 356) adopt the view that the Naturaliza- 
tion Act 1870 makes the naturalized person a full British subject, 
only to be treated in his old country in accordance with the 
international principles recognized by the British executive. 
And the foreign office, by granting passports to naturalized 
persons, acts on the same view. The point is important with 
reference to the question whether the naturalization of the father 
in the United Kingdom confers the character of British subjects 
on his children afterwards born abroad. (See Alien.) 

An analogous question arises on the provision in the Naturaliza- 
tion Act 1870, sec. 16, that the legislature of any British posses- 
sion may make laws " for imparting to any person the privileges 
of naturalization, to be enjoyed by such person within the limits 
of such possession." This, in accordance with the wider view 
of the effect of naturalization in the United Kingdom, may mean 
that naturalization in pursuance of a colonial law confers the 
full character of a British subject, only without removing 
disabilities, such as that to hold land, under which the naturalized 
person may have lain as an alien in any other British possession. 
On that footing the foreign office grants passports to the holders 
of colonial certificates of naturalization, and protects them in all 
foreign countries but that of their origin; and the Merchant 
Shipping Act 1894, sec. 1, allows persons naturalized in British 
possessions to be owners of British ships. On the other hand, 
those who maintain the narrower view of the effect of natural- 
ization in the United Kingdom naturally hold that colonial 
naturalization has no effect at all outside the British possession 
in which it is granted. 

Naturalization in India is regulated by the British Indian 
Naturalization Act, No. 30 of 1852, under which it may be 
granted to subjects of the several princes and states in India

NAUARCHIA— NAUCRATIS 



as well as to those who are entirely aliens to the British empire. 
The former, however, are treated for several purposes as British 
subjects even without being so naturalized. 

In most countries a lengthened sojourn is a condition precedent 
to naturalization. In Belgium, the United Kingdom, North 
America and Russia the period of such sojourn is fixed at five 
years, in France, Greece and Sweden at three, in the Argentine 
Republic two, while in Portugal a residence of one year is 
sufficient. In Germany, Austria and Italy no period of residence 
is prescribed, while in Austria a ten years' residence confers 
per se the rights of citizenship. In the United States an alien 
desiring to be naturalized must declare on oath his intention 
to become a citizen of the United States; two years afterwards 
must declare on oath his intention to support the constitution 
of the United States and renounce allegiance to every foreign 
power, including that of which he was before a subject; must 
prove residence in the United States for five years, and in the 
state where his application is made for one year, as a good 
citizen; and must renounce any title of nobility. In France 
an alien desiring naturalization, if he has not resided continuously 
in the country for ten years, must obtain permission to establish 
his domicile in France; three years after (in special cases one 
year) he is entitled to apply for naturalization, which involves 
the renunciation of any existing allegiance.

NAUARCHIA (Gr. vavs, ship, &pxv> command), the supreme 
command of the Spartan navy. The office was an annual one 
and could not be held more than once by the same man (Xen. 
Hell. ii. 1. 7). This law might be evaded in special cases; the 
new admiral might not be sent to take over the command until 
some time after his election, which took place at midsummer 
(Beloch in Pkilologus, xliii. p. 272 sqq.), and meanwhile his pre- 
decessor remained de facto admiral; or the retiring admiral 
might, after the expiry of his term, hold an appointment as 
secretary (eiriGTo'Kevs) to one who, though titular admiral, 
was really placed under his orders or even kept at Sparta alto- 
gether. Being independent of the kings and hampered by no 
colleague, the nauarch wielded such power that Aristotle is 
hardly going too far when he says (Politics , ii. 9. 22), rj vavapxlo. 
cxeddv irkpa fiaaiKela KaOearqicev. He was subject only to the 
ephors, who, if he proved incompetent, could depose him (Thuc. 
viii. 39), though they usually preferred to send out an advisory 
committee (aifxpovKoi). An admiral might appoint his emarokevs 
to command a portion, or even the whole, of the fleet, and if 
the former died in office the secretary succeeded to his post.

list of nauarchs known to us will be found; regarding the time of 
the election this is corrected by a later article of the same writer

NAUCK, JOHANN AUGUST (1822-1892), German classical 
scholar and critic, was born at Auerstadt in Prussian Saxony 
on the 18th of September 1822. After having studied at Halle 
and held educational posts in Berlin, he migrated in 1859 to 
St Petersburg, where he was professor of Greek at the imperial 
historico-philological institute (1860-1883). He died on the 
3rd of August 1892. Nauck was one of the most distinguished 
textual critics of his day, although, like P. H. Peerlkamp, he 
was fond of altering a text in accordance with what he thought 
the author must, or ought to, have written. 

The most important of his writings, all of which deal with Greek 
language and literature (especially the tragedians) are the following:

NAUCRARY, a subdivision of the people of Attica, which 
was certainly among the most primitive in the Athenian state. 
The word is derived either (1) from vavs (a ship) and describes 
the duty imposed upon each naucrary, of providing one ship 
and two (or, more probably, ten) horsemen; or (2) from 
valav (to dwell), in which case it has to do with a householder 
census. The former is generally accepted in view of the fact 
that the naucraries were certainly the units on, which the Athenian 
fleet was based. The view once held (on the strength of a 
fragment of Aristotle, quoted carelessly by Photius) that the 
naucrary was invented by Solon may now be regarded as obsolete 
(see the Aristotelian Constitution, viii. 3). Each of the four 
Ionian tribes was divided into three trittyes (" thirds "), each 
of which was subdivided into four naucraries; there were 
thus 48 naucraries. The earliest mention of them is in Herodotus 
(v. 71), where it is stated that the Cylonian conspiracy was 
put down by the " Prytaneis (chief men) of the Naucraries." 
Although it is generally recognized that in this passage we can 
trace an attempt to shift the responsibility for the murder of 
the suppliants from the archon Megacles, it is highly improbable 
that the Prytaneis of the Naucraries did not play a part in the 
tragedy. Thucydides is probably right, as against Herodotus, in 
asserting that the nine archons formed the Athenian executive at 
this period. It may be conjectured, however, that the military 
forces of Athens were organized on the basis of the naucraries, 
and that it was the duty of the presidents of these districts 
to raise the local levies. It is certainly remarkable that the 
Aristotelian Constitution of Athens does not connect the naucrary 
with the fleet or the army; from chapter viii. it would appear 
that its importance was chiefly in connexion with finance 
{apxh Ttrarnikvq Tpos re to\s ela<f>opas ical t(L$ 6aw6.vas). The 
naucrary consisted of a number of villages, and was, therefore, 
a local unit very much in the power of the naucraros, who was 
selected by reason of wealth. The naucraros superintended 
the construction of, and afterwards captained, the ship, and 
also assessed and administered the taxes in his own area. In 
the reforms of Cleisthenes, the naucraries gave place to the 
demes as the political unit. In accordance with the new decimal 
system, their number was increased to fifty. Whether they 
continued (and if so, how long) to supply one ship and two ' (or 
ten) horsemen each is not certainly known. Cheidemus in 
Photius asserts that they did, and his statement is to a certain 
extent corroborated by Herodotus *(vi. 89) who records that, 
in the Aeginetan War before the Persian Invasion, the Athenian 
fleet numbered only fifty sail.

NAUCRATIS, an ancient Greek settlement in Egypt. The 
site was discovered by Professor W. M. Flinders Petrie in 1884, 
on the eastern bank of a canal, about 10 m. W. of the present 
Rosetta branch of the Nile. In ancient times it was approached 
by the Canopic mouth, which was farther to the west. The 
identification of the site is placed beyond doubt by the discovery 
of inscriptions, with the name of the town, and of great masses 
of early Greek pottery, such as could not have existed anywhere 
else. The site was excavated in 1884-1886 by the Egypt Ex- 
ploration Fund, and a supplementary excavation was made by 
the British School at Athens in 1899. A list of the temples of 
Naucratis is given by Herodotus (ii. 178); they were the 
Hellenion, common to all the colonizing cities, and those dedicated

by the Aeginetans to Zeus, by the Samians to Hera, and by the 
Milesians to Apollo. A temple of Aphrodite is also mentioned 
by Athenaeus. Traces of all these temples, except that of 
Zeus, or at least dedications coming from them, have been found 
in the excavations, and another has been added to them, the 
temple of the Dioscuri. The two chief sites to be cleared were 
the temples of Apollo and of Aphrodite, in both of which succes- 
sive buildings of various date were found. Both were remarkable 
for the great mass of early painted pottery that was found; 
in the temple of Apollo this had been buried in a trench; in 
that of Aphrodite it was scattered over the whole surface in 
two distinct strata. A great deal of it was local ware, but there 
were also imported vases from various Greek sites. In addition 
to these temples, there was also found a great fortified enclosure, 
about 860 ft. by 750, in the south-eastern part of the town; 
within it was a square tower or fort; a portico of entrance and 
an avenue of rows of sphinxes was added in Ptolemaic times, 
as is shown by the foundation deposits found at the corners 
of the portico; these consisted of models of the tools and materials 
used in the buildings, models of instruments for sacrifice or 
ceremonies, and cartouches of King Ptolemy Philadelphus. 
Professor Petrie naturally supposed this great enclosure to be 
the Hellenion or common sanctuary of the Greeks, but Mr. 
Hogarth subsequently found traces of another great walled 
enclosure to the north-east of the town, together with pottery 
dedica ted rots robv^EWrjvwv 0eots,and he claims with reason that 
this enclosure is more likely than the other to be the Hellenion, 
since no early Greek antiquities have been found in the southern 
part of the town, which seems rather to have been a native 
settlement. The cemetery of the ancient town was found 
on two low mounds to the north, but was mostly of Ptolemaic 
date. 

Apart from the historic interest of the site, as the only Greek 
colony in Egypt in early times, the chief importance of the 
excavations lies in the rich finds of early pottery and in the 
inscriptions upon them, which throw light on the early history 
of the alphabet. The most flourishing period of the town was 
from the accession of Amasis II. in 570 B.c to the Persian 
invasion of 520 B.C., when the contents of the temples must 
have been destroyed. The earlier chronology has been much 
disputed. There are clear traces of a settlement going back 
to the 7th century, including a scarab factory, which yielded 
numerous scarabs, not of native Egyptian manufacture, bearing 
the names of the kings that preceded Amasis. Among these 
were fragments of early Greek pottery. It seems a fair inference 
that the makers of these were Greeks, and that they probably 
represent the early Milesian colony, settled here in the time 
of Psammetichus I., before the official assignment of the site 
by Amasis to the Greek colonists of various cities. The most 
important of the antiquities found are now in the British Museum.

NAUD&, GABRIEL (1600-1653), French librarian and scholar, 
was born in Paris on the 2nd of February 1600. He studied 
medicine at Paris and Padua, and became physician to 
Louis XIII. In 1629 he became librarian to Cardinal Bagni at 
Rome, and on Bagni's death in 1641 librarian to Cardinal 
Barberini. At the desire of Richelieu he began a wearisome 
controversy with the Benedictines, denying Gerson's authorship 
of De Imitalione Christu Richelieu intended to make Naude 
his librarian, and on his death Naude accepted a similar offer on 
the part of Mazarin, and for the next ten years devoted himself 
to bringing together from all parts of Europe the noble assemblage 
of books known as the Bibliotheque Mazarine. Mazarin's 
library was sold by the parlement of Paris during the troubles 
of the Fronde, and Queen Christina invited Naude to Stockholm. 
He was not happy in Sweden, and on Mazarin 's appeal that he 
should re-form his scattered library Naude returned at once. 
But his health was broken, and he died on the journey at Abbe- 
ville on the 30th of July 1653. The friend of Gui Patin, of Pierre 



Gassendi and all the liberal thinkers of his time, Naude was no 
mere bookworm; his books show traces of the critical spirit 
which made him a worthy colleague of the humorists and 
scholars who prepared the way for the better known writers of 
the " siecle de Louis XIV." 

Including works edited by him, a list of ninety-two pieces is 
given in the Noudaeana. The chief are Le Marfore, on discours 
contre les libeUes (Paris, 1620), very rare, reprinted 1868; Instruction 
a la France sur la virile de Vhistoire des Frhres]de la Roze-Croix 
(1623, 1624), displaying their impostures; Apologie pour tons les 
grands personnages faussement soupgonnez de magie (1625, 1652, 
1669, 1712), Pythagoras, Socrates, Thomas Aquinas and Solomon 
are among those defended; Advis pour dresser une bibliotheque (1627, 
J 644, 1676; translated by J. Evelyn, 1661), full of sound and liberal 
views on librarianship ; Addition d, Vhistoire de Louys XI. (1630), 
this includes an account of the origin of printing; Bibliographia 
toolitica (Venice, 1633, &c; in French, 1642), a mere essay or no 
bibliographical value; De studio liberali syntagma (1632, 1654), a 
practical treatise found in most collections of directions for studies; 
De studio militari syntagma (1637), esteemed in its day; Considera- 
tions politiques sur les coups d'etat (Rome [Paris], 1639; first edition 
rare, augmented by Dumay, 1752), this contains an apology for the 
massacre of St Bartholomew; Biblioth. Cordesianae Catalogue (1643), 
classified; Jugement de taut ce qui a Ste itnprime contre le Card. 
Mazarin (1649), Naude's best work, and one of the ablest defences 
of Mazarin ; it is written in the form of a dialogue between Saint- 
Ange and Mascurat, and is usually known under the name of the 
latter.

NAUGATUCK, a township and borough of New Haven 
county, Connecticut, U.S.A., on the Naugatuck river, 5 m. S. 
of Waterbury, with an area of 17 sq. m. in 1006. Pop. (1800) 
6218, (1900) 10,541, of whom 3432 were foreign-born, (1910 
census) 12,722. It is served by the New York, New Haven 
& Hartford railroad and by interurban electric railways. 
Among the principal pubtic buildings are the Whittemore 
Memorial Public Library (1892), a fine high school and the 
large Salem school (part of the public school system), all given 
to the borough by John Howard Whittemore of Naugatuck, 
who in addition endowed the library and the high school. The 
river furnishes water-power. Among the manufactures are 
rubber goods, chemicals, iron castings, woollen goods, cutlery, 
&c. The value of the factory products increased from $8,886,676 
in 1900 to $11,009,573 in 1905, or 23-9%. The prominence of 
the rubber industry here is due to Charles Goodyear (q.v.) t who 
in 1821 entered into partnership with his father Amasa Goodyear 
for the manufacture of hardware. Vulcanized rubber overshoes 
were first made in Naugatuck, and in 1843 the Goodyear's 
Metallic Rubber Shoe Company was established here. The 
township was formed from parts of Waterbury, Bethany and 
Oxford, and was incorporated in 1 844 ; the borough was 
chartered in 1893; and the two were combined in 1895. 

NAUHEIM, or Bad-Nauheim, a watering-place of Germany, 
in the grand-duchy of Hesse-Darmstadt, situated on the north- 
east slope of the Taunus Mountains, 24 m. by rail N. of Frankfort- 
on-Main on the main line of railway to Cassel. Pop. (1905) 
5054. It has three Evangelical, a Roman Catholic and an 
English church. Its thermal waters (84 to 95 F.), although 
known for centuries, were, prior to 1835, only employed for the 
extraction of salt. They now yield about 2000 tons annually. 
The town has several parks, the largest being the Kurpark, 
125 acres in extent, in which are the Kurhaus and the two chief 
springs. The waters, which are saline, strongly impregnated 
with carbonic acid, and to a less extent with iron, are principally 
used for bathing, and are specific in cases of gout and rheumatism, 
but especially for heart affections. Three smaller springs, 
situated outside the Kurpark, supply water for drinking. In 
1890-1900 a new spring (saline) was tapped at a depth of 682 ft. 
Another attraction of the place is the Johannisberg, a hill 
773 ft. high, immediately overlooking the town. 

Nauheim, which was bestowed by Napoleon upon Marshal 
Davout, became a town in 1854. From 1815 to 1866 it. belonged 
to the electorate of Hesse-Cassel, but in 1866 it was ceded to

NAULETTE, a large cavern on the left bank of the Lesse, 
which joins the Meuse above Dinant, Belgium. Here in 1866 
Edouard Dupont discovered an imperfect human lower jaw, 
now in the Brussels Natural History Museum. It is of a very 
ape-like type in its extreme projection and that of the teeth 
sockets (teeth themselves lost), with canines very strong and 
large molars increasing in size backward. It was found associated 
with the remains of mammoth, rhinoceros and reindeer. The 
Naulette man is now assigned to the Mousterian Epoch.

NAUMACHIA, the Greek word denoting a naval battle (vavs, 
ship, and judx*?, battle), used by the Romans as a term for a mimic 
sea-fight. These entertainments took place in the amphitheatre, 
which was flooded with water, or in specially constructed 
basins (also called naumachiae). The first on record, representing 
an engagement between a Tyrian and an Egyptian fleet, was given 
by Julius Caesar (46 B.C.) on a lake which he constructed in the 
Campus Martius. In 2 B.C. Augustus, at the dedication of the 
temple of Mars Ultor, exhibited a naumachia between Athenians 
and Persians, in a basin probably in the horti Caesaris, where 
subsequently Titus gave a representation of a sea-fight between 
Corinth and Corcyra. In that given by Claudius (a.d. 52) on 
the lacus Fucinus, 19,000 men dressed as Rhodians and Sicilians 
manoeuvred and fought. The crews consisted of gladiators and 
condemned criminals; in later times, even of volunteers.

marriage it has been conjectured that the author was a Christian.

NAUMANN, GEORG AMADEUS CARL FRIEDRICH (1797- 
1873), German mineralogist and geologist, was born at Dresden 
on the 30th of May 1797, the son of a distinguished musician 
and composer. He received his early education at Pforta, studied 
at Freiberg under Werner, and afterwards at Leipzig and Jena. 
He graduated at Jena, and was occupied in 1823 in teaching in 
that town and in 1824 at Leipzig. In 1826 he succeeded Mohs 
as professor of crystallography, in 1835 he became professor 
also of geognosy at Freiberg; and in 1842 he was appointed 
professor of mineralogy and geognosy in the university of Leipzig. 
At Freiberg he was charged with the preparation of a geological 
map of Saxony, which he carried out with the aid of Bernhard 
von Cotta in 1846. He was a man of encyclopaedic knowledge, 
lucid and fluent as a teacher. Early in life (1821-1822) he 
travelled in Norway, and his observations on that country, and 
his subsequent publications on crystallography, mineralogy and 
geology established his reputation. He was awarded the 
Wollaston Medal by the Geological Society of London in 1868. 
He died at Leipzig on the 26th of November 1873. 

He published Beitrage zur Kenntniss Norwegens (2 vols., 1824); 
Lehrbuch der Mineralogie (1*828); Lekrbuck der reinen und ange- 
wandten Krystallograpkie (2 vols, and atlas, 1830); Elemente der

Lehrbuch der Geognosie (2 vols, and atlas, 1 849-1 854, ed. 2, 1858- 
1872). 

NAUMBURG, a town of Germany, in the province of Prussian 
Saxony, the seat of the provincial law courts and court of appeal 
for the province and the neighbouring districts. It is situated 
on the Saale, near its junction with the Unstrut, in the centre 
of an amphitheatre of vine-clad hills, 29 m. S.W. from Halle, 
on the railway to Weimar and Erfurt. Pop. (1905) 25,137. 



The cathedral, an imposing building in the Romanesque Transi- 
tion style (1 207-1 242), has a Gothic choir at each end, and 
contains some interesting medieval sculptures. It is remarkable 
for its large crypt and its towers, a fourth having been added 
in 1894, the gift of the emperor William II. There are also 
four other Protestant churches (of which the town church, 
dedicated to St Wenceslaus and restored in 1 892-1 894, possesses 
two pictures by Lucas Cranach the elder), a Roman Catholic 
church, a gymnasium, a modern school, an orphanage and three 
hospitals. A curious feature of the town is the custom, which has 
not yet died out, of labelling the houses with signs, such as the 
" swan," the " leopard " and the " lion." The industries of the 
place mainly consist in the manufacture of cotton and woollen 
fabrics, chemicals, combs, beer, vinegar and leather. On the 
hills to the north of the town, across the Unstrut, lies Schenkel- 
burg, once the residence of the poet Gellert, and noticeable 
for the grotesque carvings in the sandstone rocks. 

In the 10th century Naumburg was a stronghold of the mar- 
graves of Meissen, who in 1029 transferred to it the bishopric of 
Zeitz. In the history of Saxony it is memorable as the scene of 
various treaties; and in 1561 an assembly of Protestant princes 
was held there, which made a futile attempt to cement the 
doctrinal dissensions of the Protestants. ~~ In 1564 the last bishop 
died, and the bishopric fell to the elector of Saxony. In 1631 
the town was taken by Tilly, and in 1632 by Gustavus Adolphus. 
It became Prussian in 1814. An annual festival, with a pro- 
cession of children, which is still held, is referred to an apocryphal 
siege of the town by the Hussites in 1432, but is probably con- 
nected with an incident in the brothers' war (1447-51), between 
the elector Frederick II. of Saxony and his brother Duke William. 
Karl Peter Lepsius (1775-1853), the antiquary and his more 
distinguished son Richard the Egyptologist, were born at 
Naumburg.

NAUNTON, SIR ROBERT (1 563-1635), English politician, the 
son of Henry Naunton of Alderton, Suffolk, was educated at 
Trinity College, Cambridge, becoming a fellow of his college in 
1585 and public orator of the university in 1594. Walter 
Devereux, earl of Essex, enabled him to spend some time abroad, 
sending information about European affairs. Having returned 
to England, he entered parliament in 1606 as member for 
Helston, and he sat in the five succeeding parliaments; in 161 4 
he was knighted, in 1616 he became master of requests and later 
surveyor of the court of wards. In 161 8 his friend Buckingham 
procured for him the position of secretary of state. Naunton's 
strong Protestant opinions led him to favour more active inter- 
vention by England in the interests of Frederick V., and more 
vigorous application of the laws against Roman Catholics. 
Gondomar, the Spanish ambassador, complained to James, who 
censured his secretary. Consequently in 1623 Naunton resigned 
and was made master of the court of wards. He died at Lether- 
ingham, Suffolk, on the 27th of March 1635. Naunton's valuable 
account of Queen Elizabeth's reign was still in manuscript when 
he died. As Fragmenla regalia, wrillen by Sir Robert Naunton, 
it was printed in 1641 and again in 1642, a revised edition, 
Fragmenta Regalia, or Observations on Die late Queen Elizabeth, 
her Times and Favourites, being issued in 1653. It was again 
published in 1824, and an edition edited by A. Arber was brought 
out in 187c. It has also been printed in several collections and has 
been translated into French and Italian. There are several 
manuscript copies extant, and some of Naunton's letters are in 
the British Museum and in other collections.

NAUPACTUS (Ital. Lepanlo, mod. Gr. Epakto), a town in 
the nomarchy of Acarnania and Aetolia, Greece, situated on a 
bay on the north side of the straits of Lepanto. The harbour, 
once the best on the northern coast of the Corinthian Gulf, is now

almost entirely choked up, and is accessible only to the smallest 
craft. Naupactus is an episcopal see; pop. about 2500. In 
Greek legend it appears as the place where the Heraclidae built 
a fleet to invade Peloponnesus. In historical times it belonged 
to the Ozolian Locrians; but about 455 B.C., in spite of a partial 
resettlement with Locrians of Opus, it fell to the Athenians, 
who peopled it with Messenian refugees and made it their chief 
naval station in western Greece during the Peloponnesian war. 
In 404 it was restored to the Locrians, who subsequently lost 
it to the Achaeans, but recovered it through Epaminondas. 
Philip II. of Macedon gave Naupactus to the Aetolians, who held 
it till 191, when after an obstinate siege it was surrendered to the 
Romans. It was still flourishing about a.d. i 70, but in Justinian's 
reign was destroyed by an earthquake. In the middle ages it fell 
into the hands of the Venetians, who fortified it so strongly that 
in 1477 it successfully resisted a four months' siege by a Turkish 
army thirty thousand strong; in 1499, however, it was taken 
by Bayezid II. The mouth of the Gulf of Lepanto was the scene 
of the great sea fight in which the naval power of Turkey was 
for the time being destroyed by the united papal, Spanish and 
Venetian forces (October 7, 157O. See Lepanto, Battle or*. In 
1678 it was recaptured by the Venetians, but was again restored 
in 1699, by the treaty of Karlowitz to the Turks; in the war of 
independence it finally became Greek once more (March 1829).

NAUPLIA, a town in the Peloponnesus, at the head of the 
Argolic Gulf. In the classical period it was a place of no import- 
ance, and when Pausanias lived, about a.d. 150, it was deserted. 
At a very early time, however, it seems to have been of greater 
note, being the seaport of the plain in which Argos and Mycenae 
are situated, and several tombs of the Mycenaean age have been 
found. A hero Nauplius took part in the Argonautic expedition; 
another was king of Euboea. The mythic importance of the town 
revived in the middle ages, when it became one of the chief cities 
of the Morea. It was captured in 1 2 1 1 by Godfrey Villehardouin 
with the help of Venetian ships; a French dynasty ruled in it for 
some time, and established the feudal system in the country. In 
1388 the Venetians bought Argos and Nauplia. In the wars 
between Venice and the Turks it often changed masters. It 
was given to the Turks at the peace concluded in 1540; 
it was recaptured by Venice in 1686, and Palamidhi on the hill 
overhanging the town was made a great fortress. In 1715 it was 
taken by the Turks; in 1770 the Russians occupied it for a short 
time. The Greeks captured it during the War of Independence 
on the 12th of December r822, and it was the seat of the Greek 
administration till 1833, when Athens became the capital of 
the country. It is the chief town of the department of Argolis 
(pop. in 1907, 81,943). Pop. a*bout 6000. 

NAUSEA (from Gr." paOs, a ship), sea-sickness, or generally 
any disposition to vomit; also used figuratively to denote 
feelings of strong aversion or dislike. 

NAUSICAA, in Greek legend, daughter of Alcinous, king of 
the Phaeacians in* the island of Scheria (Odyssey, vi. 15-315, 
viii. 457.) When Odysseus (Ulysses) was swept into the sea from 
the raft on which he had left the home of Calypso, he swam 
ashore to Scheria, where he fell asleep on the bank of a river. 
Here he was found by Nausicaa, who supplied him with clothes 
and took him to her father's palace, where he was hospitably 
entertained. She is said to have become the wife of Telemachus. 
The incident of Odysseus and Nausicaa formed the subject of a 
lost play by Sophocles and was frequently represented in ancient 
art. 

NAUTCH (Hindostani nach), an Indian ballet-dance. The 
nautch is performed by nautch-girls, who move their feet but 
little, and the dance consists of swaying the body and posturing 
with the arms. 

NAUTILUS. The term nautilus, meaning simply " the sailor," 
was applied by the ancient Greeks to the genus of eight-armed 
cuttlefishes or octopods which is now known as the paper nautilus, 
ancf whose scientific name is Argonauta (see Cephalopoda). 



This animal is not uncommon in the Mediterranean, and from 
its habit of floating at the surface attracted the attention of the 
fishermen and sailors of the Aegean Sea from the earliest times. 
The popular belief that the expanded arms are raised above the 
water to act as sails and that the other arms are used as oars 
was not based on any actual observation of the living animal, and 
it is now known that although the animal floats at the surface 
it does not sail, the expanded arms being applied to the exterior 
surface of the shell, which is secreted by them. The eggs are 
carried in the shell, and as this structure is entirely absent in the 
males, there is good reason to conclude that the habit of carrying 
the eggs and using one pair of arms for that purpose gave rise 
to the modification of those arms and the secretion of the shell 
by them. Huxley once expressed the truth of the matter with 
characteristic felicity in the remark that if the shell of the 
Argonaut is to be compared to anything of human invention or 
construction at all, it should be compared, not to a ship or boat, 
but to a perambulator. 

The shell of Argonauta (see fig. 1) is spirally coiled and sym- 
metrical, and thus bears a remarkable resemblance to the shell 
of the pearly nautilus and the extinct ammonites, especially

as it is like that of the pearly nautilus coiled towards the dorsal 
or anterior surface of the animal. It is ornamented by ridges 
and furrows which pass in transverse curves from the inner to 
the outer margin of the coils. The outer margin or keel is some- 
what flattened and the whole shell is compressed from side to side. 
It differs entirely from the shell of the pearly nautilus in the 
absence of internal septa and siphuncle and in the absence of 
any attachment between it and the body. It is in fact entirely 
different in origin and relations to the body from the typical 
molluscan shell secreted by the mantle in other Cephalopods and 
other types of Mollusca. It is a structure sui generis, unique 
in the whole phylum of Mollusca. 

The only description of the living animal by a competent 
observer which we have is that of Lacaze Duthiers, made on a 
single specimen on the Mediterranean coast of France, and pub- 
lished in 1892, and even this is in some respects incomplete. 
The specimen after capture was carried in a bucket, and became 
separated from its shell. When placed with the shell in a large 
aquarium tank the animal resumed possession of the shell and 
assumed the attitude shown in fig. 1. The shell floated at 
the surface, doubtless in consequence of « the inclusion of some 
air in the cavity of the shell. It is not known with certainty 
that the animal is able in its natural state to descend below the 
surface; the specimen here considered never did so of its own 
accord, and when pushed down always rose again.

The siphon or funnel is unusually large and prominent, and is the 
chief or only organ of locomotion, the water which is expelled from 
it driving the animal backwards. The arms are usually turned 
backwards and carried inside the shell, to the inner surface of which 
the suckers adhere, but one or two arms are from time to time 
extended in front. This does not apply to the dorsal arms which are 
applied to the outside of the shell, and the expanded membrane 
of these arms covers the greater part of its surface. The dorsal arms 
are turned backwards, and each is twisted so that the oral surfaces 
face each other and the suckers are in contact with the shell. The 
membrane or velum is thin, and is really a great expansion of a dorsal 
membrane similar to that which is found along the median dorsal 
line of the two posterior arms. The suckers of the originally posterior 
series of each dorsal arm lie alone the external border of the shell, 
and tha arm with its two rows of suckers extends round the whole 
border of the membrane, the arm being curved into a complete loop, 
so that its extremity reaches almost to the origin of the membrane 
near the base of the arm, the extremity being continued on to the 
internal surface of the membrane. The external row of suckers, 
originally the posterior row, are united by membrane which is con- 
tinuous with the velum. The smaller suckers on the more distal 
part of the arm, which extends along the edge of the shell-aperture, 
are quite sessile. In the figure of Lacaze-Duthiers (fig. i) the suckers 
appear to be turned away from the shell, but this is erroneous. 
A figure showing the natural position is given in the Monograph of 
the Cephalopoda in the series of Monographs issued by the Zoological 
Station of Naples. 

The animal described by Lacaze-Duthiers lived a fortnight in 
captivity, during which time it devoured with avidity small fishes 
which were presented to it, seizing them, not by throwing out all 
the ventral arms, but by means of the suckers near the mouth. 

Judging from these observations, Argonauta is a pelagic animal 
which lives and feeds near the surface of the ocean. Several 
species of Argonauta are known, distributed in the tropical parts 
of all the great oceans. The male is much smaller than the 
female, not exceeding an inch or ,so in length. It secretes no 
shell and its dorsal arms are not modified. The third arm on 
the left side, however, is modified in another way in connexion 
with reproduction. 

Argonauta is one of the Cephalopods in which the process known 
as hectocotylization of one arm is developed to its extreme degree, 
the arm affected becoming ultimately detached and left by the male 
in the mantle cavity of the female where it retains for some time its 
life and power of movement. The hectocotylus or copulatory arm in 
the Argonaut is developed at first in a closed cyst (fig. 2), which

Muller). 6, Hectocotylus of Tremoctopus violaceus (after Kolliker). 

afterwards bursts, allowing the arm to uncoil; the remains of the 
cyst form a sac on the back of the arm which serves to contain the 
spermatophores. 

The animal known as the Pearly Nautilus was unknown to the 
ancient Greeks, since its habitat is the seas of the far East, 
but in the middle ages, when its shell became known in Europe, 
it was called, from its superficial similarity to that of the original 
nautilus, by the same name. It was Linnaeus who, in order to 
distinguish the two animals, took the name " nautilus " from 
the animal to which it originally belonged and bestowed it upon 
the very different East Indian Mollusc, giving to the original 
nautilus the new name Argonauta. Zoological nomenclature 
dates from Linnaeus, and thus the nautilus is now the name of the 



only living genus of Tetrabranchiate Cephalopods. A detailed 
description of this animal is given in the article Cephalopoda 
(q.v.); it is only necessary to add here a brief account of its mode 
of life and habits. 

Four species are known from the Indian and Pacific oceans; they 
are gregarious and nocturnal animals living at some depth and 
apparently always on the bottom. The natural attitude of the 
animal as represented by Dr Willey is with the oral surface down- 
wards, the tentacles spread out, and the shell vertical. The chambers 
of the shell have no communication with one another nor with the 
siphuncle ; they are air-tight cavities and filled, not with water, but 
with a nitrogenous gas. ^ This necessarily very much reduces the 
specific gravity of the animal, but it is still heavier than the water 
and does not seem capable of rising to the surface any more than an 
octopus. Nautilus is rather abundant at some localities in the East 
Indian Archipelago, for example at Amboyna in the Moluccas. In 
190 1-1902 Dr Arthur Willey of Cambridge University spent some 
time in that region for the purpose of investigating the reproduction 
and development of the animal. He stationed himself at New 
Britain, known to the Germans as Neu Pommern, an island of the 
Bismarck Archipelago off the coast of Papua. The natives of this 
island use the nautilus for food, capturing them by means of a large 
fish-trap similar in construction to the cylindrical lobster-traps used 
by British fishermen. Fish is used for bait. Dr Willey found the 
males much more numerous than the females; of fifteen specimens 
captured on one occasion only two were females. He kept specimens 
alive both in vessels on shore and in large baskets moored at the 
bottom of the sea. He found that when they were placed in a vessel 
of sea water numbers of a small parasitic Crustacea issued from the 
mantle cavity. Some of the females laid eggs in captivity, but 
these were found not to be fertilized; they were about 3-5 centi- 
metres long and attached singly by a broad base to the sides of the 
cage in which the animals were confined.

NAUVOO, a city of Hancock county, Illinois, U.S.A., on the 
Mississippi river at the head of the lower rapids and about 50 m. 
aboveQuincy. Pop. (1900) 1321; (1910) 1020. On the opposite 
bank of the river is Montrose, Iowa (pop. in 1910, 708), served 
by the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy railway. Nauvoo is the 
seat of St Mary's Academy and Spalding Institute (1907), 
two institutions of the Benedictine Sisters. " Commerce City " 
was laid out here in 1834 by Connecticut speculators; but the 
first settlement of importance was made by the Mormons (q.v.) 
in 1 839- 1840; they named it Nauvoo, 1 in obedience to a 
" revelation " made to Joseph Smith, and secured a city charter 
in 1 840. Four years later its population was about 1 5,000, and 
a large Mormon temple had been built, but internal dissensions 
arose, "gentile" hostility was aroused, the charter of Nauvoo 
was revoked in 184s, two of the leaders, Joseph Smitb and his 
brother Hyrum, were killed at Carthage, the county-seat, by 
a mob, and in 1846 the sect was driven from the state. Traces of 
Mormonism, however, still remain in the ruins of the temple 
and the names of several of the streets. Three years after the 
expulsion of the Mormons Nauvoo was occupied by the remnant 
(some 250) of a colony of French communists, the Icarians, 
who had come out under the leadership of fitienne Cabet (q.v.). 
For a few years the colony prospered, and by 1855 its membership 
had doubled. It was governed under a constitution, drafted 
by Cabet, which vested the legislative authority in a general 
assembly composed of all the males twenty years of age or over 
and the administrative authority in a board of six directors, 
three of whom were elected every six months for a term of one 
year. Each family occupied its own home, but property was 
held in common, all ate at the common table, and the children 
were taught in the community school. In December 1855 
Cabet proposed a revision of the constitution to give him greater ■ 
authority. This resulted in rending the colony into two irrecon- 
cilable factions, and in October 1856 Cabet with the minority 
(172) withdrew to St Louis, Mo., where he died on the 8th of 
November. In May 1858 the surviving members of his faction 
together with a few fresh arrivals from France established a new

Icarian colony at Cheltenham near St Louis, but this survived 
only for a brief period. Nauvoo was never intended to be more 
than a temporary home for the Icarians. Soon after the schism 
of 1856 those who had rebelled against Cabet began to prepare 
a permanent home in Adams county, Iowa. There too in 1879 
the community split into two factions, the Young Party and the 
Old Party. Some time before this separation a few members 
of the colony removed to the vicinity of Cloverdale, Sonoma 
county, California, and here most of the members of the Young 
Party joined them early in 1884 in forming the Icaria-Speranza 
Community. This society tried a government quite different 
from that first adopted at Nauvoo, but it ceased to exist after 
about three years. The Old Party also adopted a new constitu- 
tion, but it too was dissolved in 1895.

NAVAN, a market town of county Meath, Ireland, situated at 
the confluence of the Blackwater with the Boyne. Pop. (1901) 
3839. It is a railway junction of some importance, where the 
Clonsilla and Kingscourt branch of the Midland Great Western 
railway crosses the Drogheda and Oldcastle branch of the Great 
Northern. By the former it is 30 m. N.W of Dublin. Navan 
is the principal town of county Meath (though Trim is the county 
town), and has considerable trade in corn and flour, some manu- 
facture of woollens and of agricultural implements, and a tannery. 
Navan was a barony of the palatinate of Meath, was walled and 
fortified, and was incorporated by charter of Edward IV. It 
suffered in the civil wars of 1641, and returned two members to 
the Irish parliament until the Union in 1800. It is governed by 
an urban district council, and is a favourite centre for rod-fishing 
for trout and salmon. 

NAVARINO, BATTLE OF, fought on the 20th of October 1827, 
the decisive event which established the independence of Greece. 
By the treaty signed in London on the 6th of July 1827 (see 
Greece, History) , England, France and Russia agreed to demand 
an armistice, as preliminary to a settlement. Sir Edward 
Codrington, then commander-in-chief in the Mediterranean, 
received the treaty and his instructions on the night of the 
loth/nth of August at Smyrna, and proceeded at once to Nauplia 
to communicate them to the Greeks. His instructions were to 
demand an armistice, to intercept all supplies coming to the 
Turkish forces in the Morea from # Africa or Turkey in general, 
and to look for directions to Stratford Canning (Lord Stratford 
de Redcliffe), the British ambassador at Constantinople. The 
ambassador's instructions reached Codrington on the 7th of 
September. He was accompanied to Nauplia by his French 
colleague, Rear-Admiral de Rigny. The Greek government 
agreed to accept the armistice. Admiral de Rigny left for a 
cruise in the Levant, and Sir Edward Codrington, hearing that an 
Egyptian armament was on its way from Alexandria, and 
believing that it was bound for Hydra, steered for that island, 
which he reached on the 3rd of September, but on the 12th of 
September found the Egyptians at anchor with a Turkish squadron 
at Navarino. The Turkish government refused to accept the 
armistice. On the 19th of September, seeing a movement among 
the Egyptian and Turkish ships in the bay, Codrington informed 
the Ottoman admiral, Tahir Pasha, that he had orders to prevent 
hostile movements against the Greeks. Admiral de Rigny joined 
him immediately afterwards, and a joint note was sent by them 
on the 22nd of September to Ibrahim Pasha, who held the 
superior command for the sultan. On the 25th an interview 
took place, in which Ibrahim gave a verbal engagement not to act 
against the Greeks, pending orders from the sultan. The allies, 
who were in want of stores, now separated, Codrington going to 
Zante and de Rigny to Cervi, where his store ships were. Frigates 



were left to watch Navarino. The British admiral had barely 
anchored at Zante before he was informed that the sultan's 
forces were putting to sea. On the 29th of September a -Greek 
naval force, commanded by an English Philhellene, Captain 
Frank Abney Hastings, had destroyed some Turkish vessels in 
Salona Bay, on the north side of the Gulf of Corinth. From 
the 3rd to the 5th of October Codrington, who had with him 
only his flagship the " Asia " (84) and some smaller vessels, 
was engaged in turning back the Egyptian and Turkish vessels, 
a task in which he was aided by a violent gale. He resumed his 
watch off Navarino, and on the 13th was joined by de Rigny 
and the Russian rear-admiral Heiden with his squadron. 
By general agreement among the powers the command was 
entrusted to Codrington, and the allied force consisted of three 
British, four French and four Russian sail of the line, if the 
French admiral's flagship the " Sirene " (60), which was technic- 
ally " a double banked frigate," be included. There were four 
British, one French and four Russian frigates, and six British 
and French brigs and schooners. The Egyptians and Turks had 
only three line of battleships and fifteen large frigates, together 
with a swarm of small craft which raised their total number 
to eighty and upwards. Ibrahim Pasha, though unable to 
operate at sea, considered himself at liberty to carry on the war 
by land. His men were actively employed in burning the 
Greek villages, and reducing the inhabitants to slavery. The 
flames and smoke of the destroyed villages were clearly seen 
from the allied fleet. On the 17th of October, a joint letter of 
expostulation was sent in to Ibrahim Pasha, but was returned 
with the manifestly false answer that he had left Navarino, and 
that his officers did not know where he was. The admirals, 
therefore, decided to stand into the bay and anchor among the 
Egyptian and Turkish ships. A French officer in the Egyptian 
service, of the name of Letellier, had anchored the vessels of 
Ibrahim and the Turkish admiral in a horseshoe formation, of 
which the points touched the entrance to the bay, and there were 
forts on the lands at both sides of the entry. The allies entered in 
two lines — one formed of the French and British led by Codrington 
in the " Asia," the other of the Russians, — and began to anchor 
in the free water in the midst of Ibrahim's fleet. The officer 
commanding the British frigate " Dartmouth " (42), Captain 
Fellowes, seeing a Turkish fireship close to windward of him, 
sent a boat with a demand that she should be removed. The 
Turks fired, killing Lieutenant G. W. H. Fitzroy, who brought 
the message, and several of the boat's crew. The " Dartmouth " 
then opened " a defensive fire," and the action became general 
at once. The allies, who were all closely engaged, were anchored 
among their enemies, and the result was obtained by their heavier 
broadsides and their better gunnery. Three-fourths of the 
Turkish and Egyptian vessels were sunk by the assailants, or fired 
by their own crews. On the allied side the British squadron 
lost 75 killed and 197 wounded; the French 43 killed and 183 
wounded; the Russians 59 killed and 139 wounded. In the 
British squadron Captain Walter Bathurst of the " Genoa " (74) 
was slain. The loss of the Turks and Egyptians was never 
accurately reported, but it was certainly very great. 

In its effects on the international situation Navarino may be 
reckoned one of the decisive battles of the world. It not only 
made the efforts of the Turks to suppress the Greek revolt hope- 
less, but it made a breach difficult to heal in the traditional 
friendship between Great Britain and Turkey, which had its 
effect during the critical period of the struggle between Mehemet 
Ali and the Porte (1831-1841). It precipitated the Russo- 
Turkish war of 1 828-1 829, and, by annihilating the Ottoman 
navy, weakened the resisting power of Turkey to Russia and 
later to Mehemet Ali.

and Logrono and W. by Alava. It is traversed from east to 
west by the Pyrenees and the Cantabrian Mountains, and almost 
the whole of the province is overrun by the ramifications of these 
ranges. From Navarre there are only three practicable roads for 
carriages into France — those by the Puerta de Vera, the Puerta dc 
Maya and Roncesvalles. The highest summit in the province 
is the Monte Adi (4931 ft.). The chief river flowing towards the 
Atlantic is the Bidasoa, which rises near the Puerta de Maya, 
and after flowing southwards through the valley of Baztan takes 
a north-easterly course, and for a short distance ahove its outfall 
at Fuenterrahia constitutes the frontier between France and 
Spain (Guipuzcoa); by far the larger portion of Navarre is 
drained to the Mediterranean through the Ebro, which flows 
along the western frontier and crosses the extreme south of the 
province. The hilly districts consist almost entirely of forest 
and pasture, the most common trees being the pine, beech, oak 
and chestnut. Much of the lower ground is well adapted for 
agriculture, and j yields grain in abundance; the principal 
fruit grown is the apple, from which cider is made in some 
districts; hemp, flax and oil are also produced, and mulherries 
are cultivated for silkworms. The wine trade is active, and the 
products of the vineyards are in great demand in south-west 
France and at Passages in Guipuzcoa for mixing with French 
wines. Navarre is one of the richest provinces of Spain in live 
stock. Game, both large and small, is plentiful in the mountains, 
and the streams abound with trout and other fish. Gypsum, 
limestone, freestone and marble are quarried; there are also 
mines of copper, lead, iron, zinc and rock salt. Mineral and 
thermal springs are numerous, but none is of more than local 
fame. The other industries include manufactures of arms, 
paper, chocolate, candles, alcohol, leather, coarse linens and 
cloth. The exports both by rail and by the passes in the 
Pyrenees consist of live stock, oil, wine, wool, leather and paper. 

The Ebro Valley railway, which traverses southern Navarre 
and skirts the western -frontier, sends out a branch line from 
Castejon to Pamplona and Alsasua junction, where it connects 
with the Northern railways from Madrid to France. Narrow- 
gauge railways convey timber and ore from the mountains to 
these main lines. Pamplona, the capital (pop., 1000, 28,886), 
and Tudela (9449) arc described in separate articles. The only 
other towns with more than 5000 inhabitants are Baztan (9234), 
Corella (6793), Estella (5736) and Tafalla (5494). 

History. — The kingdom of Navarre was formed out of a part 
of the territory occupied by the Vascones, i.e. the Basques and 
Gascons, who occupied the southern slope of the western Pyrenees 
and part of the shore of the Bay of Biscay. In the course of the 
6th century there was a considerable emigration of Basques to 
the north of the Pyrenees. The cause is supposed to have been 
the pressure put upon them by the attacks of the Visigoth kings 
in Spain. Yet the Basques maintained their independence. 
The name of Navarre is derived by etymologists from " nava " 
a flat valley surrounded by hills (a commonplace name in Spain; 
cf. Navas de Tolosa to the south of the Sierra Morena) and "crri " 
a region or country. It began to appear as the name of part of 
Vasconia towards the end of the Visigoth epoch in Spain in the 
7th century. Its early history is more than obscure. In recent 
times ingenious attempts have been made to trace the descent 
of the first historic king of Navarre from one Semen Lupus, duke 
of Aquitaine in the 6th century. The reader may consult La 
Vasconie by Jean de Jaurgain (Paris, 1898) for the latest example 
of this reconstruction of ancient history from fragmentary and 
duhious materials. Jaurgain has been subjected to very damag- 
ing criticism by L. Barrau-Dihigo (Revue Hispanique, t. vii. 
141). The first historic king of. Navarre was Sancho Garcia, 
who ruled at Pamplona in the early years of the 10th century. 
Under him and his immediate successors Navarre reached the 
height of its power and its extension* (see Spain: History j for 
the reign of Sancho cl Mayor, and the establishment of the 
Navarrese line as kings of Castile and Leon, and of Aragon). 
When the kingdom was at its height it included all the modern 
province of the name; the northern slope of the western Pyrenees 
called by the Spaniards the " Ultra-pucrtos " or country beyond 



the passes, and now known as French Navarre; the Basque 
provinces; the Bureba, the valley between the Basque Mountains 
and the Montes de Oca to the north of Burgos; the Rioja and 
Tarazona in the upper valley of the Ebro. In the 12th century 
the kings of Castile gradually annexed the Rioja and Alava. 
While Navarre was reunited to Aragon — 1076-1 134 — (see 
Spain: History) it was saved from aggression on the east, but 
did not recover the territory taken by Castile. About the year 
1200 Alfonso VIII. of Castile annexed the other two Basque 
provinces, B iscay ( Vizcaya) and G uipuzcoa . Tarazona re- 
mained in possession of Aragon. After 1234 Navarre, though the 
crown was claimed by the kings of Aragon, passed by marriage 
to a succession of French rulers. In 15 16 Spanish Navarre 
was finally annexed by Ferdinand the Catholic. French Navarre 
survived as an independent little kingdom till it was united to 
the crown of France by Henry IV. founder of the Bourbon 
dynasty. From 1510 until 1833, when it was fully incorporated 
with Spain, Navarre was a viceroyalty. 

As originally organized, Navarre was divided into Merindades, or 
districts, governed by a Merino (mayorino) as representative of the 
king. They were the Ultrapuertos (French Navarre), Pamplona, 
Estella, Judela, Sanguesa. In 1407 Olite was added. The Cortes of 
Navarre began with the king's council of churchmen and nobles. 
Butin the course of the 14th century the burgesses were added. 
Their presence was due to the fact that the king had need of their 
co-operation to raise money by grants and aids. When fully con- 
stituted, the Cortes consisted of the churchmen, the nobles and the 
representatives of twenty-seven " good towns " — that is to say, 
towns which had no feudal lord, and, therefore, held directly of the 
king. In the later stages of its history the Cortes of Navarre included 
the representatives of thirty-eight towns. The independence of the 
burgesses was better secured in Navarre than in other parliaments of 
Spain by the constitutional rule which required the consent of a 
majority of each order to every act of the Cortes. Thus the bui jesses 
could not be outvoted by the nobles and the Church. Even in the 
1 8th century the Navarrese successfully resisted the attempt of the 
kings of the^ Bourbon dynasty to establish custom houses on the 
French frontier. Yet they were loyal to their Spanish sovereigns, 
and no part of the country offered a more aetermined or more skilful 
resistance to Napoleon. Navarre was much under clerical influence. 
This, and the resentment felt at the loss of their autonomy when they 
were incorporated with the rest of Spain in 1833, account for the 
strong support given by many Navarrese to the Carlist cause.

NAVARRETE, JUAN FERNANDEZ (1526-1579), surnamed 
EI Mudo (The Mute), Spanish painter of the Madrid school, 
was born at Logrono in 1526. An illness in infancy deprived him 
of his hearing, but at a very early age he began to express his 
wants by sketching objects with a piece of charcoal. He received 
his first instructions in art from Fray Vicente dc Santo Domingo, 
a Hieronymite monk at Estella, and afterwards he visited Naples, 
Rome, Florence and Milan. According to the ordinary account 
he was for a considerable time the pupil of Titian at Venice. In 
1 568 Philip II. summoned him to Madrid with the title of king's 
painter and a salary, and employed him to execute pictures for 
the Escorial. The most celebrated of the works he there pro- 
duced are a "Nativity" (in which, as in the well-known work on 
the same subject by Correggio, the light emanates from the 
infant Saviour), a "Baptism of Christ" (now in the Madrid Picture 
Gallery), and " Abraham Receiving the Three Angels " (one of his 
last performances, dated 1576). He executed many other 
altarpieces, all characterized hy boldness and freedom in design, 
and by the rich warm colouring which has acquired for him the 
surname of " the Spanish Titian." He died at Toledo in February 

1579. 

NAVARRETE, MARTIN FERNANDEZ DE (1765-1844), 
Spanish historian, was born at Abalos on the 9th of November 
1765, and entered the navy in 1780. He was engaged in the 
unsuccessful operations against Gibraltar in 1782, and afterwards 
in the suppression of Algerine pirates. Ill-health compelled him 
for a time to withdraw from active service, but he devoted this 
forced leisure to historical research, and in 1789 he was appointed 
by the crown to examine the national archives relating to the 
maritime history of Spain. Rejoining the navy in 1793, he was 
present at the siege of Toulon, and afterwards received command 
of a frigate. From 1797 to 1808 he held in succession various

important posts in the ministry of marine. In 1808 the French 
invasion led to his withdrawal to Andalusia, and the rest of his 
life was entirely devoted to literature. In 18 19 appeared, as an 
appendix to the Academy's edition of Don Quijote, his Vida de 
Cervantes, and in 1825 the first two volumes of the Coleccion de 
los Viajes y Deseubrimientos que hicieron por Mar los Espafwles 
desde fines del Siglo XV. (3rd vol., 1829; 4th vol., 1837). In 
1837 he was made a senator and director of the academy of 
history. At the time of his death, on the 8th of Octoher 1844, 
he was assisting in the preparation of the Coleccion de Docu- 
mentos Ineditos para la Historia de Espaha. His Disertacion 
sobre la Historia de la Nautica (1846) and Biblioteca Maritima 
Espaflola (1851). were published posthumously. 

NAVARRO, PEDRO (c. 1460-1528), Spanish military engineer 
and general, of obscure parentage, was born probably about 1460. 
He began life as a sailor; and was employed later as mozo de 
espuela, or running footman, by the Cardinal Juan de Aragon; 
on the death of his employer in 1485 he enlisted as a 
mercenary in a war between Florence and Genoa; and was sub- 
sequently engaged for some years in the warfare he t ween the 
Genoese corsairs and the Mahommedans of Northern Africa. 
Navarro was not more scrupulous than others, for in 1499 he was 
at Civitavecchia, recovering from a gunshot wound in the hip 
received in a piratical attack on a Portuguese trading ship. 
When Gonsalvo de C6rdoha was sent to Sicily, to take part with 
the French in the partition of Naples, Navarro enlisted under 
him; and in the expulsion of the Turkish garrison from Cepha- 
lonia in 1500 he helped by laying mines to hreach the walls, 
though not at first with much success. The Spanish commander 
gave him a captain's commission. During the campaigns of 
1502 and 1503 he came to the front among the Spanish officers 
by the defence of Canosa and of Taranto, by his activity in 
partisan warfare on the French lines of communication, and 
by the part he took in winning the battle of Cerinola. But his 
great reputation among the soldiers of the time was founded 
on the vigour and success of his mining operations against the 
castles of Naples, held by French garrisons, in 1503, and he was 
undoubtedly recognized as the first military engineer of his age. 
When the French were expelled from Naples he received from 
Gonsalvo a grant of land and the title of count of Olivette 
In 1506 he was in Spain, and for several years he was employed 
in wars on the north coast of Africa. In 1508 he took Velez de 
Gomera, largely by means of a species of floating battery which 
he invented. In 1509 he accompanied Ximenez in the conquest 
of Oran, and did excellent service. Till 1511 he continued in 
service in Africa, and took Bougie and Tripoli in 15 10. The 
disasters at Gerba and Kerkenna did not materially affect his 
reputation. There was some talk of appointing him to command 
the army of the league formed against the French in 1512; 
but his humble birth was thought to disqualify him. He was, 
however, sent as a subordinate general. At the battle of Ravenna 
he covered the orderly retreat of the Spanish foot, and was 
struck from his horse by a shot which failed to pierce his armour. 
Being taken prisoner by the French, he was sent to the Castle 
of Loches. Ferdinand, whom the soldiers called an Aragonese 
skinflint, would not pay his ransom, and after three years of 
imprisonment he entered the service of Francis I. in a pique. 
The rest of his life was spent as a French officer. He distin- 
guished himself in the passage of the Alps, at the battle of 
Marignano, by the taking of the citadel of Milan, and in the long 
siege of Brescia. He was at the battle of Pavia, and in 1522 
was taken prisoner at Genoa by his own countrymen. He was 
confined at Naples till the peace of 1 526, but beyond the confisca- 
tion of his estate at Olivetto no punishment was inflicted for his 
treason. His last service was in the disastrous expedition of 
Lautrec to Naples in 1527, which was ruined by the plague. He 
died near the end of 1528. 

A life of Navarro by Don Martin de los Heros, is published in the 
Documentos iniditos para la Historia de Espana, vol. xxv. (Madrid, 
1854). 

NAVE, ecclesiastically considered, that part of a church 
appropriated to the laity as distinguished from the chancel, 



the choir or the presbytery, reserved for the clergy. In a 14th- 
century letter (quoted in Gasquet's Parish Lije in Medieval 
England, 1906, p. 45) from a bishop of Coventry and Lichfield 
to one of his clergy, the reason for this appropriation is given. 
" Not only the decrees of the • holy fathers but the approved 
existing customs of the Church order that the place in which 
the clerks sing and serve God according to their offices be 
divided by screens from that in which the laity devoutly pray. 
In this way the nave of the church ... is alone to be open to 
lay people, in order that, in the time of divine service, clerics 
be not mixed up with lay people, and more especially with women, 
nor have communication with them, for in this way devotion 
may be easily diminished." The word " nave " has been 
generally derived from Lat. navis, ship. Du Cange (Glossarium, 
s.v. " Navis ") quotes from the Chronicon Moriniacense, of the 
1 2th century, as to the popular origin of the name, Exterius 
etiam tabernaculum, quod ecclesiae navis a poptilo vocatur .... 
Salmasius in his commentary on Solinus (1629) finds the origin 
in the resemblance of the vaulted roof to the keel of a ship, and 
refers to Sallust (Jugurtha, 18. 8) where is noticed a similar 
.resemhlance in the huts (mapalia) of the Numidians. The use 
of the word navis may, however, be due to the early adoption 
of the " ship " as a symbol of the church (see Skeat's note on 
Piers Plowman, xl. 32). The Greek vaos, Attic ve&s (vaieiv, 
to dwell), the inner shrine of a Greek temple, the cella, has also 
been suggested as the real origin of the word. This derivative 
must presume a latinized corruption into navis, for the early 
application of the word for ship to this part of a church building 
is undoubted. 1 

Architecturally considered the nave is the central and principal 
part of a church, extending from the main front to the transepts, 
or to the choir or chancel in the absence of transepts. When 
the nave is flanked by aisles, light is admitted to the church 
through clerestory windows, some of the most ancient examples 
being the basilica at Bethlehem and the church of St Elias, 
at Thessalonica, both of the 5th century; numerous churches 
in Rome; and in the 6th century the two great hasilicas at 
Ravenna; in all these cases the sills of the clerestory windows 
were raised sufficiently to allow of a sloping roof over the side 
aisles. When, however, a gallery was carried above the side 
aisles, another division was required, which is known as the 
triforium, and this subdivision was retained in the nave even 
when it formed a passage, only in the thickness of the wall. 
In Late Gothic work in England, the triforium was suppressed 
altogether to give more space for the clerestory windows, and 
roofs of low pitch were provided over the side aisles. 

The longest nave in England is that of St Albans (300 it.), in 
which there are thirteen nave arches or bays on each side; in 
Winchester (264 ft.) there are twelve bays; in Norwich (250ft.) 
fourteen; Peterborough (226 ft.) eleven; and Ely (203 ft.) twelve 
bays. Most of these dimensions are in excess of those of the French 
cathedrals; Bourges is 300 ft. long, but as there are no transepts 
this dimension includes nave and choir. Cluny was 230 ft. with 
eleven bays; Reims is 235 ft. with ten bays; Paris 170 ft. with ten 
bays; Amiens 160 with ten bays; and St Ouen, Rouen, 200 ft. with 
ten bays. In Germany the nave of Cologne cathedral is only 190 ft., 
including the two bays between the towers. The cathedral at 
Seville in Spain is 200 ft. long, with only five bays. In Italy the 
cathedral at Milan is 270 ft. long with nine bays; at Florence, 250 it. 
long with only four bays; and St Peter's in Rome 300 ft. long with 
four bays. On the other hand, the vaults in the nave of the con- 
tinental cathedrals are far higher than those in England, that of 
Westminster Abbey being only 103 ft. high, whilst the choir of 
Beauvais is 150 ft. The result is that the^ naves of the English 
cathedrals not only are longer in actual dimensions, but appear 
much longer in consequence of their inferior height. 

1 Vessels resembling boats or shins are familiar in medieval art 
and later. Thus " Incense-boats " (navettes) somewhat of this shape 
are found in 12th-century sculptures. By the 16th century they 
approximated still more closely to a model of a ship. A large vessel, 
also in the shape of a boat or ship, and known as a nef, was used at 
the table of princes and great personages to contain the knives, 
spoons, &c. Some very elaborate examples of these survive, such as 
the 15th-century nef of St Ursula in the treasure of the cathedral at 
Reims, and that of Charles V. of France in the Musee Cluny. A 
16th-century nef, adapted for use as a cup, is in the Franks Collection 
at the British Museum. (See Drinking Vessels.)

NAVEL— NAVIGATION 



NAVEL ( O. Eng. nafela, a word common to Teutonic languages; 
cf. Ger. Nabel y Swed. nafvel; the Sanskrit is ndbhlla; the 
English root is also seen in " nave," the hub of a wheel), in 
anatomy, the umbilicus (Gr. 6fx<j>ahbs), the depression in the 
abdomen which indicates the point through which the embryo 
mammal obtained nourishment from its mother (see Anatomy: 
section Superficial and Artistic). 

NAVIGATION (from Lat. navis, ship, and agere, to move), the 
science or art of conducting a ship across the seas. The term 
is also popularly used by analogy of boats on rivers, &c, and of 
flying-machines or similar methods of locomotion. Navigation, 
as an art applied properly to ships, is technically used in the 
restricted sense dealt with below, and has therefore to be 
distinguished from " seamanship " (q.v.) y or the general 
methods of rigging a ship (see Rigging), or the management 
of sails, rudder, &c. 

History. 

The early history of the rise and progress of the art of naviga- 
tion is very obscure, and it is more easy to trace the gradual 
advance of geographical knowledge by its means than the 
growth of the practical methods by which this advance was 
attained. Among Western nations before the introduction of 
the mariner's compass the only practical means of navigating 
ships was to keep in sight of land, or occasionally, for short 
distances, to direct the ship's course by referring it to the sun 
or stars; this very rough mode of procedure failed in cloudy 
weather, and even in short voyages in the Mediterranean in 
such circumstances the navigator generally became hopelessly 
bewildered as to his position. 

Over the China Sea and Indian Ocean the steadiness in direc- 
tion of the monsoons was very soon observed, and by running 
directly before the wind vessels in those localities were able to 
traverse long distances out of sight of land in opposite directions 
at different seasons of the year, aided in some cases by a rough 
compass (q.v.). But it is surprising when we read of the progress 
made among the ancients in fixing positions on shore by practical 
astronomy that so many years should have passed without its 
application to solving exactly the same problems at sea, but 
this is probably to be explained by the difficulty of devising 
instruments for use on the unsteady platform of a ship, coupled 
with the lack of scientific education among those who would 
have to use them. 

The association of commercial activity and nautical progress 
shown by the Portuguese in the early part of the 15th century 
marked an epoch of distinct progress in the methods of practical 
navigation, and initiated that steady improvement which in 
the 20th century has raised the art of navigation almost to the 
position of an exact science. Up to the time of the Portuguese 
exploring expeditions, sent out by Prince Henry, generally 
known as the " Navigator," which led to the discovery of the 
Azores in 1419, the rediscovery of the Cape Verde Islands in 
1447 and of Sierra Leone in 1460, navigation had been conducted 
in the most rude, uncertain and dangerous manner it is possible 
to conceive. Many years had passed without the least improve- 
ment being introduced, except the application of the magnetic 
needle about the beginning of the 14th century (see Compass 
and Magnetism). Prince Henry did all in his power to bring 
together and systematize the knowledge then obtainable upon 
nautical affairs, and also established an observatory at Sagres 
(near Cape St Vincent) in order tc obtain more accurate tables 
of the declination of the sun. John II., who ascended the throne 
of Portugal in 1481, followed up the good work. He employed 
Roderick and Joseph, his physicians, with Martin de Bohemia, 
from Fayal, to act as a committee on navigation. They calcu- 
lated tables of the sun's declination, and improved the astrolabe, 
recommending it as more convenient than the cross-staff. The 
Ordenanzas of the Spanish council of the Indies record the course 
of instruction prescribed at this time for pilots; it included the 
De Sphaera Mundi of Sacrobosco, the spherical triangles of 
Regiomontanus, the Almagest of Ptolemy, the use of the astrolabe 
and its mechanism, the adjustments of instruments, cartography 
and the methods of observing the movements of heavenly bodies. 



The then backward state of navigation is best understood from a 
sketch of the few rude appliances which the mariner had, and even 
these were only intended for the purpose of ascertaining the latitude. 
The mystery of finding the longitude proved unfathomable for many 
years after the time of the Armada, and the very inaccurate know- 
ledge existing of the positions of the heavenly bodies themselves fully 
justified the quaintly expressed advice given in a nautical work of 
repute at the time, where the writer observes, " Now there be some 
that are very inquisitive to have a way to get the longitude, but that 
is too tedious for seamen, since it requireth the deep knowledge of 
astronomy, wherefore I would not have any man think that the 
longitude is to be found at sea by any instrument; so let no seamen 
trouble themselves with any such rule, but (according to their 
accustomed manner) let them keep a perfect account and reckoning 
of the way of their ship." Such record of the " way of the ship 
appears to have been then and for many years later recorded in 
chalk on a wooden board (log board), which folded like a book, and 
from which each day a position for the ship was deduced, or from 
which the more careful made abstracts into what was termed the 
14 journal." 

A comoass, a cross-staff^ or astrolabe, a. fairly good table of the 
sun's declination, a correction for the altitude of the pole star, and 
occasionally a very incorrect chart formed all the appliances of a 
navigator in the time of Columbus. For a knowledge of the speed of 
the ship one of the earliest methods of actual measurement in use 
was by what was known as the " Dutchman's log," which consisted 
in throwing into the water, from the bows of the ship, something 
which would float, and noting the interval between its apparently 
drifting past two observers standing on the deck at a known distance 
apart. No other method is mentioned until 1577, when a line was 
attached to a small log of wood, which was thrown overboard, and 
the length measured which was carried over in a certain interval of 
time; this interval of time was, we read, generally obtained by the 
repetition of certain sentences, which were repeated twice if the ship 
were only moving slowly. It is unfortunate that the words of this 
ancient shibboleth are unknown. This is mentioned by Purchas as 
being in occasional use in 1607, but the more usual method (as we 
incidentally see in the voyages of Columbus) was to estimate or guess 
the rate of progress. It was customary by one or other of these 
methods to determine the speed of a ship every two hours, " royal " 
ships and those with very careful captains doing so every hour. 
When a vessel hadbeen on various courses during the two hours, a 
record of the duration on each was usually kept by the helmsman on 
a traverse board, which consisted of a board having 32 radial lines 
drawn on it representing the points of the compass, with holes at 
various distances from the centre, into which pegs were inserted, the 
mean or average course being that entered^ on the log board. 

Some idea of the speed of ordinary ships in those days may be 
gathered from an observation in 1551 of a "certain shipp which, 
without ever striking sail, arrived at Naples from Drepana, in Sicily, 
in 37 hours" (a distance of 200 m.); the writer accounting for 
" such swift motion, which to the common sort of man scemeth 
incredible," by the fact of the occurrence of " violent floods and 
outrageous winds." In 1578 we find in Bourne's Inventions and 
Devices a description of a proposed patent log for recording a vessel's 
speed, the idea (as far as we can gather from its vague description) 
being to register the revolutions of a wheel enclosed in a case towed 
astern of a ship (see Log). 

Whether the property of the lodestone was independently dis- 
covered in Europe or introduced from the East, it does not appear to 
have been generally utilized in Europe earlier than about A.D. 1400 
(see Compass). In Europe the card or " flie " appears to have been 
attached to the magnet from the first, and the whole suspended as 
now in gimbal-rings within the " bittacle," or, as we now spell the 
word, " binnacle." The direction of a ship's head by compass was 
termed how she " capes." From the accounts extant of the stores 
supplied to ships in 1588, they appear to have usually had two 
compasses, costing 3s. 4d. each, which were kept in charge by the 
boatswain. The fact that the north point of a compass does not, jn 
most places, point to the true pole but eastward or westward of it, 
by an amount which is termed by sailors " variation," appears to 
have been noticed at an early date; but that the amount of variation 
varied in different localities appears to have been first observed by 
either Columbus or Cabot about 1490, and we find it used to be the 
practice to ascertain this error when at sea either from a bearing of 
the pole star, or by taking a mean of the compass bearings of the sun 
at both rising and setting, the deviation of the compass in the ships 
of those days being too small a quantity to be generally noticed, 
though there is a very suggestive remark on the effect of moving the 
position of any iron placed near a compass, by a Captain Sturmy of 
Bristol in 1679. In order, partially to obviate the error of the 
compass (variation), the magnets, which usually consisted of two 
steel wires joined at both ends and opened out in the middle, were not 
placed under the north and south line of the compass card, but with 
the ends about a point eastward of north and westward of south, the 
variation in London when first observed in 1580 being about n° E.; 
the change of the variation year by year at ttie same base was first 
noted by Gellibrand in 1635. 

The ' cross-staff " appears to have been used by astronomers at a 
very early period, and subsequently by seamen for measuring

altitudes at sea. It was one of the few instruments possessed by 
Columbus and Vasco da Gama. The old cross-staff, called by the 
Spaniards " ballestilla," consisted of two light battens. The. part 
we may call the staff was about ii in. square and 36 in. long. The 
cross was made to fit closely and to slide upon the staff at right 
angles ; its length was a little over 26 in., so as to allow the " pinules " 
or sights to be placed exactly 26 in. apart. A sight was also fixed on 
the end of the staff for the eye to look through so as to see both those 
on the cross and the objects whose distance apart was to be measured. 
It was made by describing the angles on a table, and laying the staff 
upon it (fig. 1). The scale of degrees was marked on the upper face. 
Afterwards shorter crosses were introduced, so that smaller angles 

could be m taken by 
the same instrument. 
These angles were 
marked on the sides 
of the staff. 

To observe with 
this instrument a 
meridian altitude of 
the sun the bearing 
was taken by com- 
pass, to ascertain 
when it was near 
the meridian; then 
the end of the long 
staff was placed close 
to the observer's eye, 
and the transver- 
sary, or cross, moved 
until one end exactly 
touched the horizon, 
and the other the sun's centre. This was continued until the sun 
dipped, when the meridian altitude was obtained. 

Another primitive instrument in common use at the beginning 
of the 1 6th century was the astrolabe (q.v.) t which was more con- 
venient than the cross-staff for taking altitudes. Fig. 2 represents 
an astrolabe as described by Martin Cortes. It was made of 
copper or tin, about i in. in thickness and 6 or 7 in. in diameter, 
and was circular except at one place, where a projection was provided 
for a hole by which it was suspended. Weight was ^considered 
desirable in order to keep it steady when in use. The face of the 
metal having been well polished, a plumb line from the point of 
suspension marked the vertical line, from which were derived the 
horizontal line and centre. The upper left quadrant was divided 
into degrees. The second part was a pointer pt of the same metal 
and thicknesses the circular plate, about 1 \ in. wide, and in length 
equal to the diameter of the circle. The centre was bored, and a line 
was drawn across it the full length, which was called the line of 
confidence. On the ends of that line were fixed plates, s % s, having 
each a small hole, both exactly over the line 
of confidence, as sights for the sun or stars. 
The pointer moved upon a centre the size of 
a goose quill. When the instrument was sus- 
pendedthe pointer was directed by hand to 
the object, and the angle read on the one 
quadrant only. Some years later the opposite 
quadrant was also graduated, to give the 
benefit of a second reading. The astrolabe was 
used by Vasco da Gama on his first voyage 
round the Cape of Good Hope in 1497; but 
the movement of a ship rendered accuracy 
impossible, and the liability to error was increased by the necessity 
for three observers. One held the instrument by a ring passed 
over the thumb, the second measured the altitude, and the third 
read off. 

For finding latitude at night by altitude of the pole star taken by 
cross-staff or astrolabe, use was made of an auxiliary instrument 
calledthe "nocturnal." From the relative positions of the two 
stars in the constellation of the '* Little Bear " farthest from the 
pole (known as the Fore and Hind guards) the position of the pole 
star with regard to the pole could be inferred, and tables were drawn 
up termed the " Regiment of the Pole Star," showing for eight 
positions of _ the guards how much should be added or subtracted 
from the altitude of the pole star; thus, " when the guards are in the 
N.W. bearing from each other north and south add hall a degree," 
&c. The bearings of the guards, and also roughly the hour of the 
night, were found by the nocturnal, first described by M. Coienct in 
1581. 

The nocturnal (fig. 3) consisted of two concentric circular plates, 
the outer being about 3 in. in diameter, and divided into twelve equal 
parts corresponding to the twelve months, each being again sub- 
divided into groups of five days. The inner circle was graduated into 
twenty-four eaual parts, corresponding to the hours of the day, and 
again subdivided into quarters; the handle was fixed to the outer 
circle in such a way that the middle of it corresponded with the day 
of the month on which the guards had the same right ascension as 
the sun— or, in other words, crossed the meridian at noon. From the 
^ common centre of the two circles extended a long index bar, which, 
together with the inner circle, turned freely and independently 




about this centre, which was pierced with a round hole. To use the 
instrument, the projection at twelve hours on the inner plate was 
turned until it coincided with the day of the month of observation, 
and the instrument held with its plane roughly parallel to the equi- 
noctial or celestial equator, the observer looking at the pole star 
through the hole in the centre, and turning the long central index bar 
until the guards were seen just 
touching itsedge; the hour in 
line with this edge read off on 
the inner plate was, roughly, the 
time. Occasionally the nocturnal 
was constructed so as to find 
the time by observations of the 
pointers in the Great Bear. 

The rough charts used by a few 
of the more expert navigators at 
the time we refer to will be more 
fully described later(see also Map 
andGEOGRAPHY). Nautical maps 
or charts first appeared in Italy at 
the end of the 13th century, but 
it is said that the first seen in 
England was brought by Bar- 
tholomew Columbus in 1489. 

Among the earliest authors 
who touched upon navigation 
was John Werner of Nurem- 
berg, who in 1514, in his notes 
upon Ptolemy's geography, de- 
scribes the cross-staff as a very

that it was only then beginning to be generally introduced 
among seamen. He recommends measuring the distance 
between the moon and a star as a means of ascertain- 
ing the longitude; but this (though developed many years 
after into the method technically known as " lunars ") was at 
this time of no practical use owing to the then imperfect know- 
ledge of the true positions of the moon and stars and the non- 
existence of instrumental means by which such distances could 
be measured with the necessary accuracy. 

Thirty-eight years after the discovery of America, when 
long voyages had become comparatively common, R. Gemma 
Frisius wrote upon astronomy and cosmogony, with the use 
of the globes. His book comprised much valuable information 
to mariners of that day, and was translated into French fifty 
years later (1582) by Claude de Bossiere. The astronomical 
system adopted is that of Ptolemy. The following are some 
of the points of interest relating to navigation. There is a good 
description of the sphere and its circles; the obliquity of the 
ecliptic is given as 23 30'. The distance between the meridians 
is to be measured on the equator, allowing 15 to an hour of time; 
longitude is to be found by eclipses of the moon and conjunctions, 
and reckoned from the Fortunate Islands (Azores). Latitude 
should be measured from the equator, not from the ecliptic, 
" as Clarean says." The use of globes is very thoroughly and 
correctly explained. The scale for measuring distances was 
placed on the equator, and 15 German leagues, or 60 Italian 
leagues, were to be considered equal to one degree. The Italian 
league was 8 stadia, or 1000 paces, therefore the degree is taken 
much too small. We are told that, on plane charts, mariners 
drew lines from various centres (i.e. compass courses), which 
were very useful since the virtue of the lodestone had become 
recognized; it must be remembered that parallel rulers were 
unknown, being invented by Mordente in 1 584. Such a confusion 
of lines has been continued upon sea charts till comparatively 
recently. Gemma gives rules for finding the course and distance 
correctly, except that he treats difference of longitude as 
departure. For instance, if the difference of latitude and 
difference of longitude are equal, the course prescribed is between 
the two principal winds — that is, 45 . He points out that the 
courses thus followed are not straight lines, but curves, because 
they do not follow the great circle, and that distances could be 
more correctly measured on the globe than on charts. The tide is 
said to rise with the moon, high water being when it is on the 
meridian and 12 hours later. From a table of latitudes and 
longitudes a few examples are here selected, by which it appears 
that even latitude was much in error. The figures in brackets

In 1534 Gemma produced an " astronomical ring," which he 
dedicated to the secretary of the king of Hungary. He admitted 
that it was not entirely his own invention, but asserted that 
it could accomplish all that had been said of quadrants, cylinders 
and astrolabes — also that it was a pretty ornament, worthy 
of a prince. As it displayed great ingenuity, and was followed 
by many similar contrivances during two centuries, a sketch 
with brief description is here given (fig. 4). 

The outer and principal sustaining circle EPQ represents the 
meridian, and is about 6 in. in diameter; Px, are the poles. The 

upper quadrant is divided 
into degrees. It is sus- 
pended by fine cord or 
wire placed at the sup- 
posed latitude. The 
second circle EQ is fixed 
at right angles to the 
first, and represents the 
equinoctial line. The 
upper side is divided into 
twenty-four parts, repre- 
senting the hours from 
noon or midnight. On 
the inner side of that 
circle are marked the 
months and weeks. The 
third ring CC is attached 
to the first at the poles, 
and revolves freely within 
it. On the interior are 
marked the months, and 
on another side the cor- 
responding signs of the 
zodiac; another is gradu- 
ated in degrees. It is 
fitted with a groove 
On the fourth side are

which carries two movable sights, 

twenty-four unequal divisions (tangents) for measuring heights. 
Its use is illustrated by twenty problems, showing it capable of 
doing roughly all that any instrument for taking angles can. Thus, to 
find the latitude, set the sights C, C to the place of the sun in the 
zodiac, and shut the circle till it corresponds with 12 o'clock. Look 
through the sights and alter the point of suspension till the greatest 
elevation is attained; that time will be noon, and the point of sus- 
pension will be the latitude. The figure is represented as slung at 
fat. 40 , either north or south. To find the hour of theday, the 
latitude and declination being known: the sights C, C being set to 
the declination as before, and the suspension on the latitude, turn the 
ring CC freely till it points to the sun, when the index opposite the 
equinoctial circle will indicate the time, while the meridional circle 
will coincide with the meridian of the place. 

There is in the museum attached to the Royal Naval College 
at Greenwich an instrument described as Sir Francis Drake's 
astrolahe. It is not an astrolabe, but may be a combination 
of astronomical rings as invented by Gemma with additions, 
probably of a later date. It has the appearance of a large gold 
watch, about i\ in. in diameter, and contains several parts 
which fall back on hinges. One is a sun-dial, the gnomon being 
in connexion with a graduated quadrant, by which it could 
be set to the latitude of the place. There are a small compass 
and an hour circle. It is very neat, but too small for actual 
use, and may he simply an ornament representing a larger 
instrument. There is a table of latitudes engraved inside one 
lid; that given for London is 51° 34', about 3 m. too much. 

Though clocks are mentioned in 1484 as recent inventions, 



watches were unknown till about 1 530, when Gemma seized the 
idea of utilizing them for the purpose of ascertaining the difference 
of longitude between two places by a comparison between their 
local times at the same instant. They were too inaccurate, 
however, to be of practical use, and their advocate proposed 
to correct them by water-clocks cr sand-clocks. For rough 
purposes. of keeping time on board ship sand glasses were em- 
ployed, and it is curious to note that hour and half-hour glasses 
were used for this purpose in the British Navy until 1839. The 
outer margin of the compass card was early divided into twenty- 
four equal parts numbered as hours until the error of thus 
determining time by the bearings of tbe sun was pointed out 
by Davis in 1607. 

In 1537 Pedro Nunez (Nonius), cosmographer to the king 
of Portugal, published a work on astronomy, charts and some 
points of navigation. He recognized the errors in plane charts, 
and tried to rectify them. Among many astronomical problems 
given is one for finding the latitude of a place by knowing the 
sun's declination and altitude when on two bearings, not 
less than 40 apart. Gemma did a similar thing with two stars; 
therefore the problem now known as a " double altitude " is 
a very old one. It could be mechanically solved on a large 
globe within a degree. To Nunez has been erroneously attributed 
the present mode of reading the exact angle on a sextant, the 
scale of a barometer, &c, the credit of which is due, however, 
to Vernier nearly a hundred years later. The mode of dividing 
the scale which Nunez published in 1542 was the following. 
The arc of a* large quadrant was furnished with forty-five con- 
centric segments, or scales, the outer graduated to oo°, the 
others to 89, 88, 87, &c, divisions. As the fine edge of tbe 
pointer attached to the sights passed among those numerous 
divisions it touched one of them, suppose the fifteenth division 
on the sixth scale, then the angle was \fc of 9o° = i5° 52' 56*. 
This was a laborious method; Tycho Brahe tried it, but aban- 
doned it in favour of the diagonal lines then in common use, 
and still found on all scales of equal parts. 

In 1545 Pedro de Medina published Arte de navigar at Valla- 
dolid, dedicated to Don Philippo, prince of Spain. This appears 
to be the first book ever published professedly entirely on naviga- 
tion. It was soon translated into French and Italian, and many 
years after into English by John Frampton. Though this pre- 
tentious work came out two years after the death of Copernicus, 
the astronomy is still that of Ptolemy. The general appearance 
of the chart given of the Mediterranean, Atlantic, and part of 
the Pacific is in its favour, hut examination shows it to be very 
incorrect. A scale of equal parts, near the centre of the chart, 
extends from the equator to what is intended to represent 
75 of latitude; by this scale London would be in 55 instead 
of 5i£°, Lisbon in 37^° instead of 38 42'. The equator is made 
to pass along the coast of Guinea, instead of being over four 
degrees farther south. The Gulf of Guinea extends 14 too 
far east, and Mexico is much too far west. Though there are 
many vertical lines on the chart at unequal distances they do 
not represent meridians; and there is no indication of longi- 
tude. A scale of 600 leagues is given (German leagues, fifteen 
to a degree). By this scale the distance between Lisbon and 
the city of Mexico is 1740 leagues, or 6960 miles; by the vertical 
scale of degrees it would be about the same; whereas the actual 
distance is 4820 miles. Here two great wants become apparent — 
a knowledge of the actual length of any arc, and the means 
of representing the surface of the globe on flat paper. There 
is a table of the sun's declination to minutes; on June 12th and 
December nth (o.s.) it was given as 23 33'. The directions 
for finding the latitude by the pole star and pointers appear 
good. For general astronomical information the book is inferior 
to that of Gemma. 

In 1556 Martin Cortes published at Seville Arte de navigar. 
He gives a good drawing of the cross-staff and astrolabe, also 
a table of the sun's declination for four years (the greatest value 
heing 23 33'), and a calendar of saints' days. The motions 
of the heavens are described according to the notions then 
prevalent, the earth being considered as fixed. He recommends

the altitude of the pole being found frequently, as the esti- 
mated distance run was imperfect. He devised an instrument 
whereby to tell the hour, the direction of the ship's head, and 
where the sun would set. A very correct table is given of the 
distances between the meridians at every degree of latitude, 
whereby a seaman could easily reduce the difference of longitude 
to departure. In the rules for finding the latitude by the 
pole star, that star is supposed to be 3 from the pole. Martin 
Cortes attributes the tides entirely to the influence of the moon, 
and gives instructions for finding the time of high water at Cadiz, 
when by means of a card with the moon's age on it, revolving 
within a circle showing the hours and minutes, the time of high 
water at any other place for which it was set would be indicated. 
Directions are given for making a compass similar to those then 
in common use, also for ascertaining and allowing for the varia- 
tion. The east is here spoken of as the principal point, and 
marked by a cross. 

The third part of Martin Cortes's work is upon charts; he 
laments that wise men do not produce some that are correct, 
and that pilots and mariners will use plane charts which are 
not true. In the Mediterranean and " Channel of Flanders" 
the want of good charts is (he says) less inconvenient, as they 
do not navigate by the altitude of the pole. 

As some subsequent writers have attributed to Cortes the credit 
of first thinking of the enlargement of the degrees of latitude on 
M creator's principle, his precise words may be cited. In making a 
chart, it is recommended to choose a well-known place near the 
centre of the intended chart, such as Cape St Vincent, which call 
37 , " and from thence towards the Arctic pole the degrees increase; 
and from thence to the equinoctial line they go on decreasing, and 
from the line to the Antarctic pole increasing. " It would appear 
at first sight that this implied that the degrees increased in length as 
well as being called by a higher number, but a specimen chart in the 
book does not justify that conclusion. It is from 34 to 40 , and the 
divisions' are unequal, but evidently by accident, as the highest and 
lowest are the longest. He states that the Spanish scale was formed 
by counting the Great Berling as 3 from Cape St Vincent (it is under 
2j°). Twenty English leagues are equal to 17J Spanish or 25 French, 
and to i° of latitude. Cortes was evidently at a loss to know the 
length of a degree, and consequently the circumference of the globe. 
The degrees of longitude are not laid down, but for a first meridian 
we are told to draw a vertical line " through the Azores, or nearer 
Spain, where the chart is less occupied." It is impossible^ in such 
circumstances to understand or check the longitudes assigned to 
places at that period. Martin Cortes's work was held in high estima- 
tion in England for many years, and appeared in several translations. 
A reprint, with additions, of Richard Eden's (1561), by John 
Tapp and published in 1609, gives an improved table of the 
sun's declination from 1609 to 1625 — the maximum value being 
23 to 30'. The declinations of the principal stars, the times of their 
passing the meridian, and other improved tables, are given, with 
a very poor traverse table for eight points. The cross-staff, he 
said, was in most common use; but he recommends Wright's sea 
quadrant. 

William Cuningham published in 1559 a book called his 
Astronomical Glass, in which he teaches the making of charts 
by a central meridional b'ne divided into equal parts, with other 
meridians on each side, distant at top and bottom in proportion 
to the departure at the highest and lowest latitude, for which 
purpose a table of departures is given very correctly to the third 
place of sexagesimals. The chart would be excellent were it not 
that the parallels are drawn straight instead of being curved. 
In another example, which shows one-fourth of the sphere, the 
meridians and parallels are all curved; it would be good were 
it not that the former are too long. .The hemisphere is also 
shown upon a projection approaching the stereographic; but 
the eighteen meridians cut the equator at equal distances apart 
instead 'of being nearer together towards the primitive. He 
gives the drawing of an instrument like an astrolabe placed 
horizontally, divided into 32 points and 360 degrees, and carrying 
a small magnetic needle to be used as a prismatic compass, 
or even as a theodolite. 

In 1581 Michael Coignet of Antwerp published sea charts, and 
also a small treatise in French, wherein he exposes the errors of 
Medina, and was probably the first who said that rhumb lines 
form spirals round the pole. He published also tables of declina- 
tion of the sun and observed the gradual decrease in the obliquity 



of the ecliptic. He described a cross-staff with three transverse 
pieces, which was then in common use at sea. Coignet died in 
1623. 

The Dutch published charts made up as atlases as early as 
1584, with a treatise on navigation as an introduction. 

In 1585 Roderico Zamorano, who was then lecturer at the naval 
college at Seville, published a concise and clearly-written com- 
pendium of navigation; he follows Cortes in the desire to obtain 
better charts. Andres Garcia de Cespedes, the successor of 
Zamorano at Seville, published a treatise on navigation at Madrid 
in 1606. In 1592 Petrus Plancius published his universal map, 
containing the discoveries in the East and West Indies and 
towards the north pole. It possessed no particular merit; the 
degrees of latitude are equal, but the distances between the 
meridians are varied. He made London appear in 51 32' N. 
and long. 22 , by which his first meridian should have been 
more than 3 east of St Michael. 

For Mercator's great improvements in charts at about this date 
see Map; from facsimiles of his early charts in Jomard, Les 
Monuments de la geographie, the following measurements have 
been made. A general chart in 1569 of North America, from 
lat. 25 to lat. 79 , is 2 ft. long north and south, and 20 in. wide. 
Another of the same date, from the equator to 6o° south lat. 
is 15-8 in. long. The charts agree with each other, a slight 
allowance being made for remeasuring. As compared with 
J. Inman's table of meridional parts, the spaces between the 
parallels are all too small. Between o° and io° the error is 8' ; at 
20 it is 5'; at 30 , 16'; at 40 , 39'; at 50 , 6i'; at 6o°, 104'; 
at 70 , 158' ; and at 79 , 182' — that is, over three degrees upon 
the whole chart. As the measures are always less than the 
truth it is possible that Mercator was afraid to give the whole. 
In a chart of Sicily by Romoldus Mercator in 1589, on which 
two equal degrees of latitude, 36 to 38 , extend 9^ in., the 
degree of longitude is quite correct at one-fourth from the top; 
the lower part is 1 m. too long. One of the north of Scotland, 
published in 1595, by Romoldus, measures 10J in. from 58 20' 
to 6i° ; the divisions are quite equal and the lines parallel; 
it is correct at the centre only. A map of Norway, 1595, lat. 6o° 
to 70°= g\ in., has the parallels curved and equidistant, the 
meridians" straight converging lines; the spaces between the 
meridians at 6o° and 70 are quite correct. 

In 1594 Blundeville published a description of Mercator's 
charts and globes; he confesses to not having known upon what 
rule the meridians were separated by Mercator, unless upon such 
a table as that given by Wright, whose table of meridional parts 
is published in the same book, also an excellent table of sines, 
tangents and secants — the former to seven figures, the latter 
to eight. These are the tables made originally by Regiomontanus 
and improved by Clavius. 

In 1594 the celebrated navigator John Davis published a 
pamphlet of eighty pages, in black letter, entitled The Seaman's 
Secrets, in which he proposes to give all that is necessary for 
sailors — not for scholars on shore. He defines three kinds of 
sailing: horizontal, paradoxical and great circle. His horizontal 
sailing consists of short voyages which may be delineated upon 
a plain sheet of paper. The paradoxical or cosmographical 
embraces longitude, latitude and distance — the combining many 
horizontal courses into' one " infallible and true," i.e. what is 
now called traverse and Mercator's sailings. His " paradoxical 
course " he describes correctly as a rhumb line which is straight 
on the chart and a curve on the globe. He points out the errors 
of the common or plane chart, and promises if spared to publish 
a " paradoxall chart." It is not known whether such appeared 
or not, but he assisted Wright in producing his chart on what 
is known as Mercator's projection a few years later. Great 
circle sailing on a globe is clearly described by Davis, and to 
render it more practicable he divides a long distance into several 
short rhumb lines quite correctly. From the practice of 
navigators in using globes the principles of such sailing were not 
unknown at an earlier date; indeed it is said that S. Cabot 
projected a voyage across the North Atlantic on the arc of a 
great circle in 1495.

NAVIGATION 



The list of instruments given by Davis as necessary to a skilful 
seaman comprises the sea compass, cross-staff, chart, quadrant, 
astrolabe, an " instrument magnetical " for finding the variation of 
the compass, a horizontal plane sphere, a globe and a paradoxical 
compass. The first three are said to be sufficient for use at sea, the 
astrolabe and quadrant being uncertain for sea observations. The 
importance of knowing the times of the tides when approaching tidal 
or barred harbours is clearly pointed out, also the mode of ascertain- 
ing them by the moon's age. A table of the sun's declination is given 
for noon each day during four years 1 593-1 597, from the ephemerides 
of J. Stadius. The greatest given value is 23 28'. Several courses 
and distances, with the resulting difference of latitude and de- 
parture, "are correctly worked out. A specimen log-book provides one 
fine only for each day, but the columns are arranged similarly to 
those of a modern log. Under the head of remarks after leaving 
Brazil, we read, " the compass varied 9 , the south point westward." 
He states that the first meridian passed through St Michael, because 
there was no variation at that place, and therefore that this meridian 
passed through the magnetic pole as well as the pole of the earth. 
He makes no mention of Mereator's chart by name nor of Cortes or 
other writers on navigation. Rules are given for finding the latitude 
by two altitudes of the sun and intermediate azimuth, also bytwo 
fixed stars, using a globe. There is a drawing of a quadrant, with a 
plumb line, for measuring the zenith distance, and one of a modifica- 
tion of a cross-staff using which the observer stands with his back to 
the sun, looking at the horizon through a sight on the end of the 
staff, while the shadow of the top of a movable projection, falls on the 
sight; this, known as the back-staff, was an improvement on the 
cross-staff. It was fitted with a reflector, and was thus the first 
rough idea of the principle of the quadrant and sextant. This 
remained in common use till superseded in 1731 by Hadley's quad- 
rant. The eighth edition of Davis's work was printed in 1657. 

Edward Wright, of Caius College, Cambridge, published in 
1599 a valuable work entitled Certain Errors in Navigation 
Detected and Corrected. One part is a translation from Roderico 
Zamorano; there is a chapter from Cortes and one from Nunez. 
A year later appeared his chart of the world, upon which both 
capes and the recent discoveries in the East Indies and America 
are laid down truthfully and scientifically, as well as his know- 
ledge of their latitudes and longitudes would admit. Just the 
northern extremity of Australia is shown. 

Wright said of himself that he had striven beyond his ability to 
mend the errors in chart, compass, cross-staff and declination of sun 
and stars. He considered that the instruments which had then 
recently come in use " could hardly be amended," as they were 
growing to " perfection " — especially the sea chart and the compass, 
though he expresses a hope that the latter may be " freed from that 
rude and gross manner of handling in the making." He gives a table 
of magnetic declinations (variation) and explains its geometrical 
construction. He states that Medina utterly denied the existence of 
variation, and attributed it to bad construction and bad observa- 
tions. Wright expresses a hope that a right understanding of the dip 
of the needle would lead to a knowledge of the latitude, " as the 
variation did of the longitude." He gives a table of declination of 
the sun for the use of English manners during four years — the 
greatest given value being 23 31' 30'. The latitude of London he 
made 51 32'. For these determinations a quadrant over 6 ft. in 
radius was used. He also treats of the " dip " of the sea horizon, 
refraction, parallax and the sun's motions. With all this knowledge 
the earth is still considered as stationary — although Wright alludes 
to Copernicus, and says that he omitted to allow for parallax. 
Wright ascertained the declinations of thirty-two stars, and made 
many improvements or additions to the art of navigation, considering 
that all the problems could be performed trijpnometrically, without 
globe or chart. He devised sea rings for taking observations, and a 
sea quadrant to be used by two persons, which is in some respects 
similar to that by Davis. While deploring the neglected state which 
navigation had been in, he rejoices that the worshipful society at the 
Trinity House (which had been established in 1514), under the favour 
of the king (Henry VI II.) ■ had removed " many gross and dangerous 
enormities." He joins the brethren of the Trinity House in the 
desire that a lectureship should be established on navigation, as at 
Sevilleand Cadiz; also that a grand pilot should be appointed, as 
Sebastian Cabot had been in Spain, to examine pilots (i.e. mates) and 
navigators. ^ Wright's desire was partially fulfilled in 1845, when an 
Act of Parliament paved the way for the compulsory qualification 
of masters and mates of merchant ships ; but such was the opposition 
by shipowners that it was even then left voluntary for a few years. 
England was in this respect more than a century behind Holland. 
It has been said that Wright accompanied the carl of Cumberland to 
the Azores in 1589, and that he was allowed £50 a year by the East 
India Company as lecturer on navigation at Gresham College, Tower 
Street. 

The great mark which Wright made was the discovery of a 
correct and uniform method of dividing the meridional line and 
making charts which are still called after the name of Mercator. 




He considered such charts as true as 'the globe itself; and so 
they were for all practical purposes. He commenced by dividing 
a meridional line, in the proportion of the secants of the latitude, 
for every ten minutes of arc, and in the edition of his work 
published in 16 10 his calculations are for every minute. His 
method was based upon the fact that the radius bears the same 
proportion to the secant of the latitude as the difference of 
longitude does to the meridional difference of latitude — a rule 
strictly correct for small arcs only. One minute is taken as the 
unit upon the arc and 10,000 as the corresponding secant, 2' 
becomes 20,000, 3' = 30,000, &c, increasing uniformly till 49', 
which is equal to 490,001; i° is 600,012. The secant of 20 
is 12,251,192, and for 20 1' it will be 12,251,192+10,642 — 
practically the same as that used in modern tables. 

The principle is simply explained by fig. 5, where b is the pole and 
bf the meridian. At any point a a minute of longitude: a min. of 
lat.: : ea (the semi-diameter of the parallel): kf 
(the radius). Again ea : kf : : kf : ki : : radius : sec. 
akf (sec. of lat). To keep this proportion on the 
chart, the distances between points of latitude 
must increase in the same proportion as the 
secants of the are contained between those points 
and the equator, which was then to be done by the 
" canon of triangles." 

Wright gave the following excellent popular de- 
scription of the principle of Mereator's charts. 
" Suppose a spherical globe (representing the 
world) inscribed in a concave cylinder to swell 
like a bladder equally in every part (that is as 
much in longitude as in latitude) until it joins 
itself to the concave surface of the cylinder, each parallel in- 
creasing successively from the equator towards either pole until 
it is of equal diameter to the cylinder, and consequently the 
meridians widening apart until they are everywhere as distant 
from each other as they are at the equator. Such a spherical surface 
is thus by extension made cylindrical, and consequently a plane 
parallelogram surface, since the surface of a cylinder is nothing else 
but a plane parallelogram surface wound round it. Such a cylinder 
on being opened into a flat surface will have upon it a representation 
of a Mereator's chart of the world." 

This great improvement in the principle of constructing charts 
was adopted slowly by seamen, who, putting it as they supposed 
to a practical test, found good reason to be disappointed. The 
positions of most places in the world had been originally laid 
down erroneously, by very rough courses and estimated distances 
upon the plane chart, and from this they were transferred 
to the new projection, so that errors in courses and distances, 
really due to erroneous positions, were wrongly attributed to the 
new and accurate form of chart. 

When Napier's Canon Mirificus appeared in 1614, Wright at 
once recognized the value of logarithms as an aid to navigation, 
and undertook a translation of the book, which he did not live to 
publish (see Napier). Gunter's tables (1620) made the applica- 
tion of the new discovery to navigation possible, and this was 
done by Addison in his Arithmetical Navigation (1625), as well as 
by Gunter in his tables of 1624 and 1636, which gave logarithmic 
sines and tangents, to a radius of 1,000,000, with directions for 
their use and application to astronomy and navigation, and also 
logarithms of numbers from 1 to 10,000. Several editions 
followed, and the work retained its reputation over a century. 
Gunter invented the sector, and introduced the meridional line 
upon it, in the just proportion of Mereator's projection. 

The means of taking observations correctly, either at sea or 
on shore, was about this time greatly assisted by the invention 
bearing the name of Pierre Vernier, the description of which was 
published at Brussels in 163 1. As Vernier *s quadrant was 
divided into half degrees only, the sector, as he called it, spread 
over 14J degrees, and that space carried thirty equal divisions, 
numbered from o to 30. As each division of the sector contained 
29 min. of arc, the vernier could be read to minutes. The verniers 
now commonly adapted to sextants can be read to 10 sees. 
Shortly after the invention it was recommended for use by P. 
Bouguer and Jorge Juan, who describe it in a treatise entitled 
La Construction, &c. t du quadrant nouveau. About this period 
Gascoigne applied the telescope to the quadrant as used on 
shore; and Hevelius invented the tangent screw, to give slow 
and steady motion when near the desired position. These

practical improvements were not applied to the rougher nautical 
instruments until the invention of Hadley's sextant in 1731. 

In 1635 Henry Gellibrand published his discovery of the annual 
change in variation of the needle, which was effected by compar- 
ing the results of his own observations with those of W. Borough 
and Edmund Gunter. The latter was his predecessor at Gresham 
College. 

In 1637 Richard Norwood, a sailor, and reader in mathematics, 
published an account of his most laudable exertions to remove 
one of the greatest stumbling-blocks in the way of correct 
navigation, that of not knowing the true length of a degree or 
nautical mile, in a pamphlet styled The Seaman's Practices. 
Norwood ascertained the latitude of a position near the Tower 
of London in June 1633, and of a place in the centre of York 
in June 1635, with a sextant of more than 5 ft. radius, and, 
having carefully corrected the declination of the sun and allowed 
for refraction and parallax, made the difference of latitude 
2 28'. He then measured the distance with a chain, taking 
horizontal angles of all windings, and made a special table for 
correcting elevations and depressions. A few places which he 
was unable to measure he paced. His conclusion was that a 
degree contained 367,176 English feet; this gives 2040 yds. 
to a nautical mile — only about 12 yds. too much. Norwood's 
work went through numerous editions, and retained its popularity 
over a hundred years. In a late edition he says that, as there 
is no means of discovering the longitude, a seaman must trust 
to his reckoning. He recommends the knots on the log-line 
to be placed 51 ft. apart, as the just proportion to a mile when 
used with the half-minute glass. To Norwood is also attributed 
the discovery of the " dip " of the magnetic needle in 1576. 

The progress of the art of navigation was and is still of course 
inseparably connected with that of map and chart drawing and 
the correct astronomical determinations of positions on land. 
While as we have seen at an early period simple practical astro- 
nomical means of finding the latitude at sea were known and in 
use, no mode could be devised of finding longitude except by 
the rough method of estimating the run of the ship, so that the 
only mode of arriving at a port of destination was to steer so as to 
get into the latitude of such a port either to the eastward or west- 
ward of its supposed position, and then approach it on the parallel 
of its latitude. The success of this method would of course greatly 
depend upon the accuracy with which the longitude of such 
port was known. Even with the larger and more accurate 
instruments used in astronomical observatories on shore the 
means of ascertaining latitude were far in advance of those by 
which longitude could be obtained, and this equally applied 
to the various heavenly bodies themselves upon which the 
terrestrial positions depended, the astronomical element of 
declination (corresponding to latitude) being far more accurately 
determined than that of right ascension (corresponding to 
longitude). 

Almanacs were first published on the continent of Europe in 
1457, but the earliest printed work of that kind in England is 
dated 1497. The only portions of their contents of use to seamen 
were tables of the declination of the sun, rough elements of the 
positions of a few stars, and tables for finding latitude by the 
pole star. 

No accurate predictions of the positions of the moon, stars 
and planets could, however, be made until the laws governing 
their movements were known, such laws of course involving a 
knowledge of their actual positions at different widely separated 
epochs. 

In 1699 Edmund Halley (subsequently astronomer royal), in 
command of the " Paramour," undertook a voyage to improve 
the knowledge of longitude and of the variation of the compass. 
The results of his voyage were the construction of the first 
variation chart, and proposals for finding the longitude by 
occultations of fixed stars. 

The necessity for having more correct charts being equalled by 
the pressing need of obtaining the longitude by some simple and 
correct means available to seamen, many plans had already been 
thought of for this purpose. At one time it was hoped that the 
longitude might be directly discovered by observing the variation 
xrx. 10 



of the compass and comparing it with that laid down on charts. 
In 1674 Charles II. actually appointed a commission to investigate 
the pretensions of a scheme of this sort devised by Henry Bond, and 
the same idea appears as late as 1777 in S. Dunn's Epitome. But the 
only accurate method of ascertaining the longitude is by knowing the 
difference of time at the same instant at the meridian of the observer 
and that of Greenwich; and till the invention and perfecting of 
chronometers this could only be done by finding at two such places 
the apparent time of the same celestial phenomenon. 

A class of phenomena whose comparative frequency recommended 
them^ for longitude observations, viz. the eclipses of Jupiter's 
satellites, became known through Galileo's discovery of these bodies 
(1610). Tables for such eclipses were published by Dominic Cassini 
at Bologna in 1688, and repeated in a more correct form at Paris in 
1693 by his son, who was followed by J. Pound, J. Bradley, P. W. 
Wargentin, and many other astronomers. But this method, though 
useful on land, is not suited to mariners; when W. Whiston, lor 
example, in 1737 recommended that the satellites should be ob- 
served by a reflecting telescope, he did not sufficiently consider the 
difficulty of using a telescope at sea. 

Another method proposed was that of comparing the local time 
of the moon's crossing the meridian of the observer with the predicted 
time of the same event at Greenwich, the difference of the two de- 
pending upon the moon's motion during the time represented by the 
longitude; thus Heme's Longitude Unveiled (1678), proposes to find 
the time of the moon's meridian passage at sea by equal altitudes with 
the cross-staff, and then compare apparent time at ship with London 
time. The accuracy of this, as in the case of lunar problems, would 
obviously depend upon a more perfect knowledge of the laws of the 
moon's motion than then existed. 

The celebrated problem of finding longitude by lunars (or by 
measurement of lunar distances ") occupied the attention of 
astronomers and sailors for many years before being superseded by 
the mere simple and accurate modern method by the use of chrono- 
meters, and was the principal reason for establishing the Royal 
Observatory at Greenwich and the subsequent publication of the 
Nautical Almanac^ The principle was simple^ depending upon the 
comparatively rapid movement of the moon with regard to the 
heavenly bodies lying in her immediate path in the heavens. It is 
evident that if the theory of this movement were perfectly under- 
stood and the positions of such heavenly bodies accurately deter- 
mined, the distances of the moon from those at any instant of time at 
Greenwich could be accurately foretold so that if such predictions 
were published in advance, an observer at any place in the world, by 
simply measuring such distances, could accurately determine the 
Greenwich time, a comparison of which with the local time (which in 
clear weather can be frequently and simply determined) would give 
the longitude. This, as previously mentioned, was foreseen by J. 
Werner as early as 1 5 14, but very great difficulties attendee! its 
practical application for many years. Until the establishment of 
national astronomical observatories it was impossible to accumulate 
the vast number of observations necessary to fulfil the astronomical 
conditions, and until the invention of the sextant no instrument 
existed capable of use at sea which would measure the distances 
required with the necessary accuracy, while even up to the time when 
the problem had attained its greatest practical accuracy the calcula- 
tions involved were far too intricate for general use among those for 
whom it was chiefly intended. The very principles of a theory of the 
movements of the moon were unknown before Newton's time, when 
the lunar problem begins to have a chief place in the history of 
navigation; the places of stars were formerly derived from various 
and widely discrepant sources. 

The study of the lunar problem was stimulated by the reward of 
1000 crowns offered by Philip IILof Spain in 1598 for the dis- 
covery of a method of finding longitude at sea; the States-general 
followed with an offer of 10,000 florins. But for a long time nothing 
practical came of this; a proposal by J. B. Morin, submitted to 
Richelieu in 1633, was pronounced by commissioners appointed to 
judge of it to be impracticable through the imperfection of the lunar 
tables, and the same objection applied when the question was raised 
in England in 1674 by a proposal of St Pierre to find the longitude by 
using the altitudes of the moon and two stars to find the time each 
was from the meridian. When the kingwas pressed by St Pierre, 
Sir J. Moore and Sir C. Wren to establish an observatory for the 
benefit of navigation, and especially that the moon's exact position 
might be calculated a year in advance, Flamsteed gave his judgment 
that the lunar tables then in use were quite useless, and the positions 
of the stars erroneous. The result was that the king decided upon 
establishing an observatory in Greenwich Park, and Flamsteed was 
appointed astronomical observer on March 4, 1675, upon a salary of 
£100 a year, for which also he was to instruct two boys from Christ's 
Hospital. While the small building in the Park was in course of 
erection he resided in the Queen's House (now the central part of 
Greenwich Hospital school), and removed to the house on the hill 
on the 10th of July 1676, which came to be known as " Flamsteed 
House." The institution was placed under the surveyor-general of 
ordnance — perhaps because that office was then held by Sir Jonas 
Moore, himself an eminent mathematician. Though this was not the 
first observatory in Europe, it was destined to become the^ most 
useful, and has amply fulfilled the important duties for which it was

designed. It was established to meet the exigencies of navigation, 
as was clearly stated on the appointment of Flamsteed, and on 
several subsequent occasions; we see now what an excellent foster- 
mother it has been to the higher branches of that science. This has 
been accomplished by much labour and patience; for, though 
originally the most suitable man in the kingdom was placed in 
charge, it was so starved and neglected as to be almost useless during 
many years. The government did not provide a single instrument. 
Flamsteed entered upon his important duties with an iron sextant of 
7 ft. radius, a quadrant of 3 ft. radius, two telescopes and two clocks, 
the last given by Sir Jonas Moore. Tycho Brahe's catalogue of 777 
stars, formed in about 1590, was his only guide. In 1681 he fitted a 
mural arc which proved a failure. Seven years after another mural 
arc was erected at a cost of £120, with which he set to work in 
earnest to verify the latitude, and to determine the position of the 
equinoctial point, the obliquity of the ecliptic and the right ascen- 
sions and declinations of the stars; he obtained the positions of 
2884 which appeared in the " British catalogue " in 1723 (see 
Flamsteed, and Astronomy). 

Flamsteed died in 1719, and was succeeded by Halley, who paid 
particular attention to the motions of the moon with a view to the 
longitude problem. A paper which he published in the Phil. Trans. 
(1731) shows what had been accomplished up to that date, and 
proves that it was still impossible to find the longitude correctly by 
any observation depending upon the predicted position of the moon. 
He repeats what he had published twenty years before in an appendix 
to Thomas Street's Caroline tables, which contained observations 
made by him (Halley) in 1 683-1 684 for ascertaining the moon's 
motion, which he thought to be the only practical method of 
" attaining " the longitude at sea. The Caroline tables of Street, 
though better than those before his time as well as those of Tycho, 
Kepler, Bullialdus and Horrox, were uncertain; sometimes the 
errors would compensate one another; at others when they fell the 
same way the result might lead to a position being 100 leagues in 
error. He hopes that the tables will be so amended that an error 
may scarce ever exceed 3 minutes of arc (equal to i£° of longitude). 
Sir Isaac Newton's tables, corrected by himself (Halley) and others 
up to 1713, would admit of errors of 5 minutes, when the moon was 
in the third and fourth quarters. He blames Flamsteed for neglecting 
that portion of astronomical work, as he was at the observatory more 
than two periods of eighteen years. He himself had at this time seen 
the whole period of the moon s apogee — less than nine years — during 
which he observed the right ascensions at her transit, with great 
exactness, almost fifteen hundred times, or as often as Tycho Brahe, 
Hevelius and Flamsteed together. He hoped to be able to compute 
the moon's position within 2 minutes of arc with certainty, which 
would reduce errors of position to 20 leagues at the equator and 15 in 
the Channel; he thought Hadley's quadrant might be applied to 
measure lunar distances at sea with the desired accuracy. 1 

The rise of modern navigation may be fairly dated from the 
invention of the sextant in 1731 and of the chronometer in 1735; 
the former a complete nautical observatory in itself, and the 
latter an instrument which in its modern development has 
become an almost perfect time-keeper. It was a curious co- 
incidence that these two invaluable instruments were invented 
at so nearly the same time. Until 1731 all instruments in use 
at sea for measuring angles either depended on a plumb line or 
required the observer to look in two directions at once. 

Their imperfections are clearly pointed out in a paper by Pierre 
Bouguer (1729) which received the prize of the Paris Academy of 
Sciences for the best method of taking the altitude of stars at sea. 
Bouguer himself proposes a modification of what he calls the English 
quadrant, probably the one suggested by Wright and improved by 
Davis. t Fig. 6 represents the instrument as proposed, capable of 
measuring Fully 90 from E to N. A fixed pinule was recommended 
to be placed at E, through which a ray from the sun would pass to 
the sight C. The sight F was movable. The observer, standing with 
his back to the sun would look through Fand C at the horizon, shifting 
the sight F up or down till the ray from the sun coincided with the 
horizon. The space from E to F would represent the altitude, and 
the remaining part F to N the zenith distance. The English quad- 
rant which this was to supersede differed in having about half the 
arc from E towards N, and, instead of the pinule being fixed at E, 
it was on a smaller arc represented by the dotted line eB f and 
movable. It was placed on an even number of degrees, considerably 
less than the altitude; the remainder was measured on the larger arc, 
as described. 

1 Halley's observations were published posthumously in 1742, and 
in 1765 the commissioners of longitude paid his daughter £100 for 
MSS. supposed to be useful to navigation. As the moon passes the 
stars lying in her course through the heavens at the mean rate of 33* 
in one minute of time, it is obvious that an error to that amount in 
measuring the distance from a star would produce an error of 15 m. 
in longitude. As the moon's motion with regard to the sun is nearly 
one degree a day less, a similar error in the distance would produce 
still more effect.

Hadley's instrument, on the other hand, described to the 
Royal Society in May 1731 (Phil. Trans.), embodies Newton's 
idea of bringing the reflection of one object to coincide with the # 
direct image of the other. He calls it an octant, as the arc is* 
actually 45 , or the eighth part of a circle; but, in consequence 
of the angles of incidence and 
reflection both being changed 
by a movement of the index, 
it measures an angle of 90 , and 
is graduated accordingly; the 
same instrument has therefore 
been called a quadrant. It was 
very slowly adopted, and no 
doubt there were numerous 
mechanical difficulties of cen- 
tring, graduating, &c, to be 
overcome before it reached per- 
fection. In August 1732, in 
pursuance of an order from the 
Admiralty, observations were 
made with Hadley's quadrant 
on board the " Chatham " 
yacht of 60 tons, below Sheer- 
ness, in rough weather, by persons — except the master attendant 
— unaccustomed to the motion; still the results were very satis- 
factory. A year later Hadley published (Phil. Trans., 1733) the 
description of an instrument for taking altitudes when the 
horizon is not visible. The sketch represents a curved tube or 
spirit-level, attached to the radius of the quadrant, since which 
time many attempts have been unsuccessfully made to construct 
some form of artificial horizon adapted to use at sea on board 
ship, a discovery which would greatly facilitate observations at 
night and at the many times when the natural or sea horizon is 
imperfectly visible. 

From the year 17 14 the history of navigation in England is 
closely associated with that of the " Commissioners for the 
discovery of longitude at sea," a body constituted in that year 
with power to grant annually sums not exceeding £2000 to 
assist experiments and reward minor discoveries, and also to 
judge on applications for much greater rewards which* were 
from time to time offered to open competition. For a method . 
of determining the longitude within 60 geographical miles, to 
be tested by a voyage to the West Indies and back, the sum of 
£10,000 was offered; within 40 m., £15,000; within 30 m., 
£20,000. £ 10,000 was also to be given for a method that would 
determine longitude within 80 m. near the shores of greatest 
danger. No action seems to have been taken before 173 7 ; 
the first grant made was in that year, and the last in 1815, but 
the board continued to exist till 1828, having disbursed in the 
course of its existence £101,000 in all. 2 In the interval a number 
of other acts had been passed either dealing with the powers, 
constitution and funds of the commissioners or encouraging 
nautical discovery; thus the act 18 George II. (1745) offered 
£20,000 for the discovery by a British ship of the North-West 
Passage, and the act 16 George III. (1776) offered the same 
reward for a passage to the Pacific either north-west or north- 
east, and £5000 to any one who should approach by sea within 
one degree of the North Pole. All these acts were swept away 
in 1828, when the longitude problem had ceased to attract 
competitors, and voyages of discovery were nearly over. 

The suggestions and applications sent in to the commissioners were 
naturally very numerous and often very trifling; but they some- 
times furnish useful illustrations of the state of navigation. Thus, 
in a memorial by Captain H. Lanoue (1736), he records a number of 
recent casualties, which shows how carelessly the largest ships were 
then navigated. Several men-of-war off Plymouth in 1691 were 

2 This total comprises the large sums awarded to Harrison and to 
the widow of Mayer, the cost of surveys and expeditions in various 
parts of the globe, large outlays on the Nautical Almanac and on 
subsidiary calculations and tables, rewards for new methods and 
solutions of problems, and many minor grants to watchmakers or for 
improvements in instruments. Thus Jesse Ramsden received in 
1775 and later about £1600 for his improvements in graduation 
(q.v.), and E. Massey in 1804 got £200 for his log (see Log).

wrecked through mistaking the Dead man for Berry Head. Admiral 
Wheeler's squadron in 1694, leaving the Mediterranean, ran on 
Gibraltar when they thought they had passed the Strait. Sir 
Cloudesley Shovel's squadron, in 1707, was lost on the rocks off 
Scilly, by erring in their latitude. Several transports, in 171 1, were 
lost near the river St Lawrence, having erred 15 leagues in the 
reckoning during twenty-four hours. Lord Bel haven was lost on 
the Lizard on the 17th of November 1721, the same day on which he 
sailed from Plymouth. 

Many rewards were paid by the commissioners for methods by 
which the tedious calculations involved in " clearing the lunar 
distance " could be abbreviated; thus Israel Lyons (i739". I 775) 
received £10 for his solution of this problem from the commissioners 
in 1769; and in 1772 he and Richard Dunthorne (1711-1775) 
each obtained £50. George Whichell, master of the Royal Naval 
Academy, Portsmouth, conceived a plan whereby the correction 
could be taken from a table by inspection. In October 1765 the 
commissioners of longitude awarded him £100 to enable him to 
complete and print 1000 copies of his table. On the following 
April they gave him £200 more. The work was continued on the same 
plan by Antony Shepherd, the Plumian professor of astronomy, 
Cambridge, with some additions by the astronomer-royal. The total 
cost of the ponderous 4to volume up to the time of publication in 
June 1772 was £3100, after which £200 more was paid to the Rev. 
Thomas Parkinson and Israel Lyons for examining the errata. It 
was a very large and expensive volume — ill-adapted for ship's use. 
Considerable sums were paid by the commissioners from time to 
time for other tables to facilitate navigation — not always very 
judiciously. It is sufficient to mention here the tables of Michael 
Taylor and those of Mendoza, published in 1815. The proposals 
submitted to the board to find the longitude by the time of the 
moon's meridian passage are very numerous. 4 

One of the first points to which the attention of the com- 
missioners was directed was the survey of the coasts of Great 
Britain, which was pressed on them by Whiston in 1737. He 
was appointed surveyor of coasts and headlands, and in 1741 
received a grant for instruments. An act passed in 1740 
enabled the commissioners to spend money on the survey of 
the coasts of Great Britain and the " plantations." At a later 
date they bore part of the expenses of Cook's scientific voyages, 
and of the publication of their results. Indeed it is to them 
that we owe all that was done by England for surveys of coasts, 
both at home and abroad, prior to the establishment of the 
hydrographk department of the Admiralty in 1795. But their 
chief work lay in the encouragement they gave on the one hand 
to the improvement of timepieces, and on the other to the 
perfecting of astronomical tables and methods, the latter being 
published from time to time in the Nautical Almanac. Before 
we pass on to these two important topics we may with advantage 
take a view of the state of practical navigation in the middle 
of the 1 8th century as shown in two of the principal treatises 
then current. 

John Robertson's Elements of Navigation passed through six 
editions between 1755 and 1796. It contains good teaching on 
arithmetic, geometry; spherical trigonometry, astronomy, geography, 
winds and tides, also a small useful table for correcting the middle 
time between the equal altitudes of the sun-^all good, as is also the 
remark that " the greater the moon's meridian altitude the greater 
generally the tides will be." He states that Lacaille recommends 
equal altitudes being observed and worked separately, in order to 
find the time from noon, and the mean of the results taken as the 
truth. There is a sound article on chronology, the ancient and 
modern modes of reckoning time. A long list of latitudes, longitudes 
and times of high water finishes vol. i. The second volume is said 
by the author to treat of navigation mechanical and theoretical ; by 
the former he means seamanship. He gives instructions for all kinds 
of sailings, for marine surveying and making Mercator's chart. 
There are two good traverse tables, one to quarter points, the other 
to every 15 minutes of arc; the distance to each is 120 m. There is 
a table of meridional parts to minutes, which is more minute than 
customary. Book ix., upon what is now called " the day's work," 
or dead-reckoning, appears to embrace all that is necessary. A great 
many methods, we are told, were then used for measuring a snip's 
rate of sailing, but among the English the log and line with a 
half-minute glass were generally used. Bouguer and Lacaille pro- 
posed a !o£ with a diver to avoid the drift motion (1753 and 1760). 
Robertson s rule of computing the equation of equal altitudes is as 
good as any used at the present day. He gives also a description 
of an equal- altitude instrument, having three horizontal wires, 
probably such as was used at Portsmouth for testing Harrison's 
timekeeper. The mechanical difficulties must have been great in 
preserving a perpendicular stem and a truly horizontal sweep for the 
telescope. It gave place to the improved sextant and artificial 
horizon. The second edition of Robertson's work in 1764 contains an 
excellent dissertation on the rise and progress of modern navigation 



by Dr James Wilson, which has been greatly used by all subsequent 
writers. 

Don Jorge Juan's Compendio de Navegacton, for the use of mid- 
shipmen, was published at Cadiz in 1757. Chapter i. explains what 
pilotage is, practical and theoretical. He speaks of the change of 
variation, " which sailors have not believed and do not believe now." 
He describes the lead, log and sand-glass, the latter corrected by 
a pendulum, charts plane and spherical. Supposing his readers to 
be versed in trigonometry, he explains what latitude and longitude 
are, and shows a method for finding the latter different from what has 
been taught. He explains the error of middle latitude sailing, and 
shows that the longitude found by it is always less than the truth. 
(It is strange that while reckoning was so rough and imperfect in 
many respects such a trifle as that is in low latitudes should be 
noticed.) After speaking of meridional parts, he offers to explain the 
English method, which was discovered by Edmund Halley, but omits 
the principles upon which Hal ley founded his theory, as it was " too 
embarassing." He gives instructions for allowing for currents and 
leeway, tables pi declination, positions of a few stars, meridional 
parts, &c. It is worthyof remark that, after giving a form for a 
log-book, he adds that this had not been previously kept by any one, 
but he thought it should not be trusted to memory. He only re- 
quires the knots, fathoms, course, wind and leeway to be marked 
every two hours. He gives a sketch of Halley's quadrant, but 
without a clamping screw or tangent screw. 

To ascertain local time at sea by astronomical observations 
by the altitude of suitably-situated heavenly bodies was an old, 
well-known and frequently practised operation, so that a 
comparison could thus be easily made between such local time 
and the Greenwich time if known at the same instant. The 
introduction of timekeepers by which Greenwich time can be 
carried to any part of the world, and the longitude found with 
ease, simplicity and certainty is due to the invention of John 
Harrison. 

The idea of keeping time at sea by watches was no novelty, but the 
practical difficulty arose from their very irregular rates owing to 
changes of temperature and the motion of the ship. Huygens had 
applied pendulums to the regulation of clocks on snore in 1656, and 
in 1675 his application of spiral springs as regulators of watches 
made them available for use at sea. William Derham published a 
scientific description of various kinds of timekeepers in The Artificial 
Clock-Maker, in 1700, with a table of equations from Flamsteed to 
facilitate comparison of mean time with that shown by the sun-dial 
or apparent time. In 1714 Henry Sully, an Englishman, published 
a treatise at Vienna, on finding time artificially. He went to France, 
and spent the rest of his life in trying to make a timekeeper for the 
discovery of the longitude at sea. In 1716 he presented a watch of 
his own make to the Academy of Sciences, which was approved; 
and ten years later he went to Bordeaux to try his marine watches, 
but died before embarking. Julien le Roy was his scholar, and 
perfected many of his inventions in watchmaking. 

Harrison's great invention was the principle of compensation 
through the unequal contraction of two metals, which he first applied 
in the invention in 1726 of the compensation (gridiron) pendulum, 
still in use, and then modified so as to fit it to a watch, devising at the 
same time a means by which the watch retains its motion while being 
wound up. With regard to the success of the trial journey (see 
Harrison, John) to Jamaica in 1 761-1762, it may be noted that 
by the journal of the House of Commons we find that the error of 
the watch was ascertained by equal altitudes at Portsmouth and 
Barbados, the calculations being made by Short ; these errors came 
greatly within the limits of the act. At Jamaica the watch was only 
in error five seconds (assuming that the longitude previously found 
by the transit of Mercury could be closely depended on, which as we 
now know, was not the case, the observations being too few in number, 
and taken with an untrustworthy instrument). Short at Portsmouth 
found the whole unallowed-for error from November 6th, 1761, till 
April 2nd, 1762, to be i m 54 , .5 = i8 geographical miles in the latitude 
of Portsmouth. During the passage home in the " Merlin" sloop-of- 
war the timekeeper was placed in the after part of the ship, because 
it was the dryest place, and there it received violent shocks which 
retarded its motion. It lost on the voyage home i m 49* — 16 geo- 
graphical miles. 

One might have supposed that Harrison had now secured the 

Erize; but there were powerful competitors who hoped to gain it 
y lunars, and a bill was passed through the House in 1763 which 
left an open chance for a lunarian during four years. A second West 
Indies trial of the watch took place between November 1763 and 
March 1764, in a voyage to Barbados, which occupied four months; 
during which time it is said, in the preamble to act 5 Geo. III. 1765, 
not to have erred 10 geographical miles in longitude. We only find 
in the public records the equal altitudes taken at Portsmouth and 
at Bridgetown, Barbados. William Harrison assumed an average 
rate of i 1 a-day gaining, and he anticipated that it would go slower 
by I 8 for every 10° increase in temperature. The longitude of 
Bridgetown was determined by N. Maskelyne and C. Green by nine 
emersions of Jupiter's first satellite, against five of Bradley s and

two at Greenwich Observatory, to be 3 h 54° 20" west of Greenwich. 
In February 1765 the commissioners of longitude expressed an 
opinion that the trial was satisfactory, but required the principles 
to be disclosed and other watches made. t Half the great reward was 
paid to Harrison under act of parliament in this year, and he and his 
son g^ave full descriptions and drawings, upon oath, to seven persons 
appointed by the commissioners of longitude. 1 The other half of the. 
great reward was promised to Harrison when he had made other 
timekeepers to the satisfaction ot the commissioners, and provided 
he gave up everything to them within six months. The second half 
was not paid till 1773, after trials had been made with five watches. 
These trials were partly made at Greenwich by Maskelyne, who, as 
we shall see, was a great advocate of lunars, and was not ready to 
admit more than a subsidiary value to the watch. A bitter contro- 
versy arose, and Harrison in 1767 published a book in which he 
charges Maskelyne with exposing his watch to unfair treatment. 
The feud between the astronoiner-royal and the watchmakers con- 
tinued long after this date. 

Even after Harrison had received his £20,000, doubts were felt 
as to the certainty of his achievement, and fresh rewards weie 
offered in 1774 both for timekeepers and for improved lunar tables 
or other methods. But the tests proposed for timekeepers were very 
discouraging, and the watchmakers complained that this was due to 
Maskelyne. A fierce attack on the astronomer's treatment of himself 
and other watchmakers was made by Thomas Mudge in 1792, in 
A Narrative of Facts, addressed to the first lord of the Admiralty, 
and^ Maskelyne's reply does not convey the conviction that full 
justice was done to timekeepers. Maskelyne at this date still says 
that he would prefer an occultation of a bright star by the moon and 
a number of correspondent observations of transits of the moon 
compared with those of fixed stars, made by two astronomers at 
remote places, to any timekeeper. The details of these controversies, 
and of subsequent improvements in timekeepers, need not detain us 
here. In England the names of John Arnold and Thomas Earnshaw 
as watchmakers are prominent, each of whom received, up to 1805, 
£3000 reward from the commissioners of longitude. It was Arnold 
who introduced the name chronometer. The French emulated the 
English efforts for the production of good timekeepers, and favour- 
able trials were made between 1768 and 1772 with watches by Le 
Roy and F. Berthoud. 

The marvellous accuracy with which the modern chronometer 
is constructed is doubtless greatly stimulated by the annual 
competition at Greenwich, from which the Admiralty purchase 
for the British navy. These chronometers are all fitted with 
secondary compensation balances, and it is therefore unusual 
in the navy to apply any temperature correction to the rate. 
The perfection obtainable in compensation may be illustrated 
by the performance of a chronometer at the Royal Observatory 
in 1S86, which at a mean temperature of 50° F. had a weekly 
rate of i-6 sees, losing; and on being further tested at a mean 
temperature of 02 F., it only changed its weekly rate to 2-9 sees, 
losing. In the mercantile marine cheaper chronometers without 
secondary compensation are more commonly used, and tempera- 
ture corrections applied, calculated from a formula originally 
proposed by Hartnup, formerly of the Liverpool Observatory. 
Great success attends this mode of procedure, as illustrated by 
the following facts. From the discussion of the records of per- 
formance of the chronometers of the Pacific Steam Navigation 
Company during twenty-six voyages from London to Valparaiso 
and back, by giving equal weight to each of the three chrono- 
meters carried by each ship, the mean error of longitude for an 
average voyage of 101 days was less than three minutes of arc. 
As a single instance, in the s.s. Orellana> on applying temperature 
rates during a voyage of 6$ days, the mean accumulated error 
of the three chronometers was only 2-3 sec. of time. 

While chronometers were thus rapidly approaching their 
present perfection the steady progress of astronomy both by the 
multiplication and increased accuracy of observations, and 
by corresponding advances in the theory, had made it possible 
to construct greatly improved tables. In observations of the 
moon Greenwich still took the lead; and it was here that Hailey's 
successor Bradley made his two grand discoveries of aberration 
and nutation which have added so much to the precision of 
modern astronomy. Kepler's Rudolphine tables of 1627 and 
Street's tables of j66j, which had held their ground for almost 

x The explanations and drawings are at the British Museum; 
and two of his watches, one of which was used by Captain Cook in the 
" Resolution," are at Greenwich Observatory. In 1767 Harrison 
estimates that a watch could be made for £100, and ultimately for 
£70 or £80. 



a century, were rendered obsolete by the observations of Halley 
and his successor. At length, in 1753, in the second volume of 
the Commentarii of the Academy of Gottingen, Tobias Mayer 
printed his new solar and lunar tables, which were to have so 
great an influence on the history of navigation. Mayer after- 
wards constructed and submitted to the English government in 
1755 improved MS. tables. Bradley found that the moon's 
place by these tables was generally correct within 1', so that the 
error in a longitude found by lunar would not be much more than 
half a degree if the necessary observations could be taken 
accurately at sea. Thus the lunar problem seemed to have at 
length become a practical one for mariners, and in England it 
was taken up with great energy by Nevil Maskelyne — " the 
father," as he has been called, " of lunar observations." 

In 1761 Maskelyne was sent to St Helena to observe the 
transit of Venus. On his voyage out and home he used Mayer's 
printed tables for lunar determinations of the longitude, and 
from St Helena he wrote a letter to the Royal Society {Phil. 
Trans. t 1762), in which he described his observations made with 
Hadley's quadrant of 20 in. radius, constructed by John Bird, 
and the glasses ground by Dollond. He took the observations 
both ways to avoid errors. The arc and index were of brass, 
the frame mahogany; the vernier was subdivided to minutes. 
The telescope was 6 in. long, magnified four times, and inverted. 
Very few seamen in that day possessed so good an instrument. 
He considered that ship's time should be ascertained within 
twelve hours before or after observing the lunar distance, as a 
good common watch will scarcely vary above a minute in that 
time. This shows that he must have intended the altitudes to 
be calculated — which would lead to new errors. He considered 
that his observations would give the longitude within i\ degrees. 
On the nth of February he took ten observations; the extremes 
were a little over one degree apart. 

On his return to England Maskelyne prepared the British 
Mariner's Guide (1763), in which he undertakes to furnish 
complete and easy instructions for finding the longitude at sea 
or on shore,within a degree, by observing the distance between 
the moon and sun, or a star, by Hadley's quadrant. How far that 
promise was fulfilled, and the practicability of the instructions, 
are points worth consideration, as the book took a prominent 
place for some years. The errors which he said were inseparable 
from the dead-reckoning " even in the hands of the ablest and 
most skilful navigators," amounting at times to 15 degrees, 
appear to be overestimated. On the other hand, the equations 
to determine the moon's position at time of observation from 
Mayer's tables, would, he believed, always determine the longi- 
tude within a degree, and generally to half a degree, if applied 
to careful observations. He recommends the two altitudes and 
distance being taken simultaneously when practicable. The 
probable error of observation in a meridian altitude he estimated 
at one or two minutes, and in a lunar distance at two minutes. 
He then gave clear rules for finding the moon's position and 
distance by ten equations, too laborious for seamen to undertake. 
Admitting the requisite calculations for finding the moon's 
place to be difficult, he desired to see the moon's longitude 
and latitude computed for every twelve hours, and hence 
her distance from the sun and from a proper star on each side of 
her carefully calculated for every six hours, and published 
beforehand. 

In 1765 Maskelyne became astronomer-royal, and was able 
to give effect to his own suggestion by organizing the publication 
of the Nautical Almanac. The same act of 1765 which gave 
Harrison his first £10,000 gave the commissioners authority 
and funds for this undertaking. Mayer's tables, with his MS. 
improvements up to his death in 1762, were bought from his 
widow for £3000; £300 was granted to the mathematician L. 
Euler, on whose theory of the moon Mayer's later tables were 
formed; and the first Nautical Almanac, that for 1767, was 
published in the previous year, at the cost and under the authority 
of the commissioners of longitude. In 1696 the French nautical 
almanac for the following year appeared, an improvement on 
what had been before issued by private persons, but it did not

attempt to give lunar distances. 1 In the English Nautical 
Almanac for 1767 we find everything necessary to render it 
worthy of confidence, and to satisfy every requirement at sea. 
The great achievement was that of giving the distance from the 
moon's centre to the sun, when suitable, and to about seven fixed 
stars, every three hours. The mariner has only to find the 
apparent time at ship, and clear his own measured lunar distance 
from the effects of parallax and refraction (for which at the end 
of the book are given the methods of Lyons and Dunthorne), 
and then by simple proportions, or proportional logarithms, find 
the time at Greenwich. The calculations respecting the sun and 
moon were made from Mayer's last manuscript tables under the 
inspection of Maskelyne, and were so continued till 1804. 2 The 
calculations respecting the planets are from Halley's tables, 
and those of Jupiter's satellites from tables made by Wargentin 
and published by Lalande in 1759 (except those for the fourth 
satellite). The original Nautical Almanac contained all the 
principal points of information which the seaman required, but 
the great value of such an authentic publication to the whole 
astronomical world led soon to a considerable increase to its 
contents. As much of this was unnecessary for the ordinary 
requirements of navigation, since 1903 it has been issued in two 
forms, the larger for observatory purposes, the smaller for the 
class for whom it was originally intended. 

Various useful rules and tables were appended to early volumes 
of the Almanac. Thus that for 1771 contains a method and table for 
determining the latitude by two altitudes and the elapsed time (first 
published by Cornelius Downes of Amsterdam in 1740). At the 
end of the Almanac for 1772 Maskelyne and Whichell gave three 
special tables for clearing the lunar distance; still their rule is 
neither short nor easily remembered. An improvement of Dun- 
thorne's solution is also jpven. In the edition lor 1773 a new table 
for equations of equal altitude was given by W. Wales. In those for 
1797 and 1800 tables were added by John Brinkley for rendering 
the calculations for double altitudes easier. 

The plan of the Nautical Almanac was soon^ imitated by other 
nations. In France the Acade*mie Royale de Marine had all the lunar 
distances translated from the British Nautical Almanac for 1773 and 
following years, retaining Greenwich time for the three-hourly 
distances. The tables were considered excellent, and national pride 
was satisfied by their having been formed on the plan proposed 
by Lacaille. They did not imitate the mode given for clearing the 
lunar distance, considering their own better. 

Though the Spaniards were leaders in the art of navigation during 
the 16th and 17th centuries, it was not till November 4, 1791, that 
their first nautical almanac was printed at Madrid, having been 
previously calculated at Cadiz for the year 1792. They acknowledge 
borrowing from the English and French. The excellent Berlin 
Astronomisches Jahrbuch began to appear in 1776, the American 
Ephemeris in 1849. These two ephemerides and the French Con- 
naissance des temps are independent and valuable works. 

A book of Tables Requisite to be Used with the Nautical Ephemeris 
was published by Maskelyne at the same time as the first Almanac. 
and ten thousand copies were quickly sold. A second edition, pre- 
pared by Wales, appeared in 1781, an octavo of 237 pages, in the 
preface of which it is stated that it contains everything necessary for 
computing the latitude and longitude by observation. There are in 
all twenty-three tables, the traverse tableland table of meridional 
parts alone being deficient as compared with modern works of the 
kind; dead-reckoning Maskelyne did not touch. He gave practical 
methods for working several problems; that for computing the lunar

Mayer's tables were printed at London under Maskelyne's 
superintendence in 1770. 



especially is an improvement on those by Lyons and Dunthorne, and 
a rule given for clearing the distance, called Dunthorne's improved 
method, is remarkably short. Maskelyne's rule for finding the 
latitudes by two altitudes and the elapsed time is also good. The 
third edition of the Tables was issued in 1802. 

The publication of the Requisite Tables met a great want, and the 
existence of such accurate and conveniently-arranged mathematical 
tables for the special purposes of nautical calculations led to the more 
general use of many refinements which had been previously neglected. 
They formed the original of many subsequent and greatly extended 
collections, of which those by J.\V. Norie are the more generally used 
in modern times in the mercantile marine, and the very accurate and 
comprehensive tables by James I nman (originally published in 1823) 
are constantly used in the British navy. 

Until the middle of the 17th century mariners generally employed 
small collections of Dutch charts, known as waggoners from 
Waghenair, the name of a celebrated Dutch hydrographer in 1584. 
In 1671 appeared the English Pilot by John Sellers, who is styled the 
" Hydrographer Royal." It forms a collection of rude sketches of 
the coasts of England, the North Sea, France and Spain, with safling 
directions, and on its appearance the importation of Dutch charts 
was prohibited. Private enterprise, for many years after that, 
supplied both the British navy and the British mercantile marine 
with constantly improving charts, especially latterly, under the 
powerful patronage of the East India Company, whose hydrographer 
(Alexander Dairy mple), in 1795, was selected as the first hydro- 
grapher of the Admiralty. This post has since been occupied by a 
succession of distinguished naval officers under whom have grown 
up a large school of able nautical surveyors, the results of whose 
labours are now published in the well-known Admiralty charts. 

Prior to the issue of charts by the Admiralty, the instructions to 
masters of vessels in the British navy enjoined them to " provide such 
charts and instruments as they considered necessary for the safe 
navigation of the ship," while on the completion of a voyage of 
discovery it was customary for the results to be published for the 
Admiralty by private firms. 

The establishment of the Admiralty Hydrographic Office in 
1 79S marked a great step in the advancement of the art of naviga- 
tion. On the 1 2th of August of that year an order in council 
placed all such nautical documents as were^tben in the possession 
of the Admiralty in charge of Dalrymple, whose catalogue, 
compiled for the use of the East India Company in 1786, contained 
347 charts between England, the Cape, India and China; thus 
the germ of the present hydrographic department was estab- 
lished. The expense was then limited to £650 a year. The first 
official catalogue of Admiralty charts was issued in 1830, the 
total number being then 962. 

After the close of the long devastating war in 181 5 both trade 
and science revived, and several governments besides that of 
Great Britain saw the necessity of surveying the coasts in various 
parts of the globe; the greater portion of the work fell to the 
English hydrographical department, which took under its charge 
nearly every place where the inhabitants were not able to do it 
for themselves. Since that time its career of usefulness has 
steadily developed, and it not merely undertakes the constant 
improvement of the charts of the whole world, but periodically 
issues for the use of the seafaring community a vast amount of 
most accurate and practical nautical information on the various 
closely allied subjects of navigation, tides, compass adjustment 
and ocean meteorology. 

A knowledge of the times and heights of high and low water and 
the directions of the tidal streams due to those phenomena are in 
many^ parts of the world (and especially round our own coasts) of 
vital importance to navigation. The theory of the tides was first 
laid down by Newton and Laplace, and in Phil. Trans. , 1683, there 
is an account of Flamsteed's tide table for London Bridge, which 
gave the times of each high tide on every day in the year. For a 
long subsequent period empirical tide tables for a few places in 
England were published by private individuals, but in 1832 the 
researches of Dr W. Whewell and Sir J. W. Lubbock enabled official 
tide tables to be issued by the Admiralty. These have steadily 
advanced in detail and accuracy, being now in many cases based on 
continuous tidal observations for a whole lunar period of 18} years, 
and represent the practical epitome of our knowledge of the tides 
and tidal currents of the whole world. The formulae and tables on 
which these predictions are based are given in the introduction to 
each annual volume (see TinE).

from an early period to the present time, we will now describe

referring our readers for more technical information to \he 
professional text-books enumerated at the end of this article. 
The great development in both size and speed of modern ships 
enormously increases the responsibilities of those who command 
and navigate them, and has led to a careful examination of 
the existing modes of determining a ship's position at all times 
by day or night, both when in sight of land and on the open ocean. 
An examination of the present text-books on the subject of 
navigation shows how problems and methods which were formerly 
considered chiefly as theoretical exercises have now, from the 
altered conditions of the navigation of very fast ships, become 
methods of frequent practice, while corresponding improvements 
have been made in the instruments, such as compasses, charts 
and chronometers, by the aid of which more satisfactory results 
are now attained. Much has also been done to advance the 
study of this and its numerous allied subjects by the development 
of the Royal Naval College at Greenwich and the United Seivice 
Institution; also by the establishment of shipmasters' societies 
(of which the well-known society in London is typical), where 
during the year valuable papers are read and useful discussions 
take place among those actually carrying out the practice of 
navigation. 

In planning out in advance a long ocean voyage the experienced 
navigator would first, by laying down the track from port to 
port on a great circle chart, ascertain the shortest route between 
them, remembering that the greatest saving in distance over 
other routes is when the ports are far apart in longitude and 
both in high latitudes of the same name. On examining such 
a track in conjunction with the wind and current charts it will 
be seen what modifications the intervention of land, unfavourable 
currents or winds, ice or unduly high latitude render necessary, 
and such modified route would be finally adopted subject to 
possible change as the voyage progressed. The judgment 
formed on the best route to follow would also be largely influenced 
by the remarks in the volumes of Sailing directions or " Pilots " 
relating to the region about to be traversed,while among the 
many excellent modern publications of the Hydrographic 
Office of the Admiralty perhaps the Ocean Passage Book is one 
of the most generally useful, since, when used in combination 
with the admirable charts of suggested full-powered and auxiliary 
tracks, it very greatly assists all navigators in planning out 
a successful voyage. Finally the intended route would be trans- 
ferred from the great circle chart to one on Mercator's projection, 
which is the more convenient for purposes of navigation since 
in constructing the former for the sake of simplicity a projection 
of the coast's surface is adopted on which great circles are 
correctly shown as straight lines (gnomonic), while for practical 
purposes in navigation such a representation on which a ship's 
track when steering a continuous course (technically termed a 
rhumb line) is truly shown as a straight line (Mercator) is the 
most convenient, although in high latitudes giving a very 
distorted representation of the surface depicted. It is well to 
remember that on great circle charts rhumb lines become curves 
and great circles straight lines, and, vice versa, on Mercator 
charts, the rhumb line on each projection being that nearer 
to the equator, all meridians and the equator on both projections 
are shown as straight lines. 

Ships rarely steer on great circles, which would generally 
theoretically involve continually altering course, but a scries 
of chords of such circles are described of lengths such as involve 
a practical change of course of one or two degrees on the com- 
pletion of each. 

Great circle charts are very useful for drawing what is known 
as a composite track where if the great circle route would lead 
into too high a latitude the shortest route to and from the highest 
desirable parallel is readily laid down, the intervening track 
being pursued on that parallel. 

A method of drawing approximate great circles directly 
on Mercator charts was proposed by Airy in 1858, and is some- 
times very useful. The excellent idea, originally suggested 
by M. F. Maury, of establishing steam " lanes " in localities 
where there is much ocean traffic, so as to minimize the risks of 



collision between outward and homeward bound ships, has been 
successfully carried out in the North Atlantic. The leading 
transatlantic steamship companies now agree to follow great 
circle routes from the Irish coast to points on the Banks of 
Newfoundland, which vary somewhat in position with the 
season of the year, but are published in advance. These " lanes " 
being avoided by sailing vessels, risks of collision are materially 
lessened. 

Having thus planned the most desirable general track to 
pursue, three methods are employed to ascertain the position 
of the ship at. any time during such voyage: these are (1) pro- 
jecting the track on charts; (2) simple trigonometrical calcula- 
tions where the data are the course steered and distance run; 
and (3) astronomical observations, which form an entirely 
independent method. 

Of these the first is the least trustworthy, owing to the usual 
difficulties attending accurate graphic methods and the small 
scales on which ocean charts are necessarily drawn. When 
near the land the larger scale coast charts are used, and in the 
approaches to harbours still larger scale plans give increasing 
accuracy to this record of a ship's position. Index charts of 
all parts of the world are provided, by referring to which the 
navigator ascertains which chart or plan to employ, always 
preferably using that on the largest scale. 

On leaving harbour, and while near the coast, the position 
is not found by calculation but by frequently observing (when 
a variety of objects is in sight) (1) simultaneous sextant angles 
between suitably situated objects subsequently laid down on 
the chart by a station pointer; (2) simultaneous compass 
bearings of two or more objects (technically known as cross 
bearings) ; or (3) a combination of both methods by employing 
one bearing and one angle. All such methods are capable of 
considerable accuracy if the observations are made simultane- 
ously. Should only a small number of objects, or sometimes 
only one, be visible (as frequently occurs at night) other and 
rougher methods are practised, depending upon the change 
of bearing of an object while a certain distance in a certain 
direction is traversed by the ship, such knowledge being based 
in many cases on an estimate of the action of the tide. When 
a ship is steaming at the rate of 20 knots the navigator remembers 
that a mile is passed over in three minutes, and that if in sight 
of land and fixing positions by objects on shore, it is essential to 
adopt some rapid method; otherwise when laid down on the 
chart the position shows where the ship was, and not where 
she is. This difficulty has led to the more general use of methods 
of obtaining positions by angles instead of bearings, and laying 
thein down on the chart by the aid of the station pointer. Many 
advantages accrue from this, as the observer is not restricted 
in position on board, as is the case when using the compass, 
and especially if a double sextant (having two index glasses 
and one horizon glass) is employed two angles can be measured 
simultaneously, the result on the chart being very rapidly 
arrived at. An ingenious combination of sextant and station 
pointer in one has been proposed, and most simply carried out 
by attaching vertical sights to the legs of a station pointer, 
which is put on a suitable horizontal stand, and the legs moved 
until the sights are in line with the objects observed. To assist 
the navigator in the choice of suitable objects between which 
to measure the angles, a very useful pamphlet is issued by the 
Admiralty, from the diagrams in which* it can be seen at a glano 
which combination of objects in sight gives the most favourable 
result, always remembering as a broad principle that nearei 
objects are more suitable than distant ones, and that the accurac; 
of position determined depends on the relative distances of tin 
objects as well as on the magnitude of the angles between them 

In these circumstances, which render these rougher methods 
those only available, and especially in hazy weather in many 
known localities (such as the English Channel), a continuous 
line of deep sea soundings at fairly even distances apart affords 
an additional verification of position, remembering that only 
an occasional sounding might prove very misleading.

incomplete without reference to the extended use of Lord 
Kelvin's sounding machines, either in the original form, where 
the increased pressure at different depths is recorded by dis- 
coloration of chemical tubes, or in the later form known as the 
" depth recorder," where similar results are obtained hy the 
automatic record of the position of a piston forced upwards 
in a tube by this increased pressure. Very satisfactory results 
can be obtained at speeds of 15 or 16 knots, enabling that great 
safeguard of navigation in many places, viz. a continuous line 
of soundings, to be accurately and rapidly obtained. In con- 
nexion with this should be mentioned a most ingenious invention 
known as the " suhmarine sentry," which on being set for any 
desired depth and towed overboard remains at that depth what- 
ever the speed of the ship may be. On striking bottom it at once 
floats to the surface and rings a warning hell. Such an instru- 
ment is of obvious value in ships where, owing to the small 
number of available men, it is difficult to maintain a continuous 
line of soundings. To avoid an unnecessarily wide detour in 
rounding points and shoals, extensive use is now made of both 
horizontal and vertical danger angles ; the former is the angle 
on the arc of a horizontal circle passing through a point at the 
required distance from the danger, and through two previously 
selected, easily recognized, fixed objects. Should circumstances 
enable the selection to be made of an angle of about oo°, the 
ship hy continually measuring the angle may he steered on the 
arc of such a circle with great precision, and may even be safely 
taken through a channel between two dangers. The vertical 
danger angle enahles similar results to be attained by measuring 
the vertical angle subtended by a known height; but except 
where the selected object is one whose height is well determined, 
such as a lighthouse, this method is not so trustworthy as the 
former. 

Before losing sight of land the latitude and longitude of the last 
well-determined position found by the methods referred to is 
taken from the coast chart, transferred to the ocean or small scale 
chart, and considered to be the " departure " or starting-point of 
the ocean voyage, and from that point the course and distance 
run by the ship is laid down, heing rectified on every occasion 
when the position is more accurately determined by astronomical 
means. To obviate the inevitable inaccuracies attending this 
graphic method and as a corroboration of the ship's position, 
the changes of latitude and longitude involved in each alteration 
of course are daily calculated by plane trigonometry, such 
calculations being materially abbreviated by the use of the 
Traverse Table, which is a tabulated expression of the solutions 
of right-angled plane triangles. 

The foregoing modes of keeping account of a ship's position are 
technically known as " dead reckoning." The general introduc- 
tion of compasses with short needles and slow periods of vibration 
has done very much towards improving the accuracy with which 
a ship's " dead reckoning " is kept. The original model of these 
was that patented by Lord Kelvin in 1876, and since adopted in 
the British navy as the standard. In this instrument we have 
a compass specially designed to enahle the principles of com- 
pensation or correction proposed by Sir G. B. Airy in 1837 to 
be accurately carried out, while its slow period of swing renders, 
it in all circumstances extremely steady. 

The record of distance run is always obtained from the patent 
log, usually in the form of the Cherub or Taffrail log introduced 
in 1878. The common or hand log has ceased to be regarded as 
anything but the very roughest of guides, and the patent log 
in its original form, in which it recorded the revolutions of a small 
screw towed by the ship, docs not give satisfactory results at 
great speeds, nor can anything more favourable be said of those 
forms where pressure on known areas is employed. The revolu- 
tions of the engines, with due allowance made for the condition 
of the ship's hottom, afford now perhaps the best means of 
estimating speed (see Log). 

Astronomical observations afford the most accurate means 
of ascertaining positions at sea, other methods (dead reckoning) 
being only relied upon when the weather does not admit of the 
practice of these, though hy utilizing twilight and night observa- 



tions of moon, stars and planets, the navigator in most parts 
of the world need seldom proceed far without the means of 
astronomically rectifying his position either in latitude, longitude 
or both at the same time. 

The practical problems involved are precisely those employed 
at astronomical observatories, but it is not possible to attain 
similar accuracy of results, for though the sextant (the instru- 
ment always employed at sea in making such observations) 
is capable of marvellous accuracy, yet, as practically all such 
observations depend directly upon altitudes measured ahove 
the sea horizon, the uncertainty and variability of the true 
position of this, due to the changing effects of refraction, much 
affect observations made at any one time. This error in practice 
is greatly reduced by methods of combining several observations 
made at different times and using their mean or average result. 

A notahle feature of the progress of the art of modern navigation 
is the greatly increased practice of star navigation, and many of 
the supposed difficulties of night observations are found to be 
removed by experience. Determinations of positions at sea by 
twilight observations, when the brighter stars become visihle 
while the horizon is still well defined, are probably the most 
accurate means we possess; and the careful navigator, by 
combining for latitude stars passing north and south of the zenith, 
and for longitude those near the prime vertical hoth east and west, 
can generally depend upon a good result, especially if suitable 
stars can be found for each pair at about the same altitudes. 
For these purposes the armillary sphere is extremely useful: 
this is a small celestial globe on which are depicted the principal 
stars visible to the naked eye. On elevating the pole to the 
approximate latitude of the observer, and turning the sphere 
until the sidereal time is under the fixed meridian, a correct 
representation of the heavens at the time of observation is 
ohtained; the stars a^e then easily identified by their bearings 
and altitudes. This valuahle instrument is not merely useful 
when at twilight, only a few of the brighter stars being visible, the 
constellations to which they belong are" difficult of recognition, 
but it enables arrangement to he made in advance for such 
observations as are desired to he taken during the night. By 
marking in pencil on the globe the positions of the planets in 
right ascension and declination, the same sphere is also available 
for their identification. The heavenly bodies commonly observed 
at sea are: The Sun, Moon, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, the 
Pole star, and the larger (or first magnitude) fixed stars, the 
positions of all of which in the heavens are given in the Nautical 
Almanac for fixed epochs at Greenwich, with the requisite data 
for computing their positions at all other times in all other places. 

The chief astronomical observations made at sea are those for 
ascertaining (1) latitude, (2) time and thence longitude, (3) error of 
compass, and (4) latitude and longitude simultaneously. 

To ascertain latitude by itself altitudes of heavenly bodies are 
measured above the horizon when they are on or near the meridian 
and therefore exactly or nearly north or south of the observer; in 
the case of the sun, of course, this means at or near noon, and in the 
case of other bodies such local times are previously accurately 
ascertained by a simple calculation made from the Nautical Almanac 
or more roughly found from an armillary sphere. The principle 
involved is the simple one that by subtracting the observed altitude 
when on the meridian from 90° the distance of the zenith or point 
overhead north or south of the heavenly body is found; then by 
combining with this the distance, obtained from the Nautical 
Almanac , of the body considered north or south of the celestial 
equator at the same instant, it is found how far the zenith is north 
or south of the celestial equator, and this js exactly the same as rhe 
latitude of the observer since the celestial equator is merely the 
imaginary extension of that of the earth. Such observations are not 
necessarily restricted to that which can be taken at the instant when 
the body observed is on the meridian (meridian altitude); equally 
accurate and multiplied observations can be made on either or both 
sides of the meridian if the body is somewhat near it (ex-meridian 
and circum-meridian altitudes), and a simple calculation or reference 
to a specially constructed table or graphic curve gives the required 
result. 

Errors arising from uncertainty as to the true position of the 
horizon are with twilight and night observations largely counter- 
acted by taking the means of results obtained from observations 
made of heavenly bodies crossing the meridian both north and 
south of the observer, taken as nearly at the same time as convenient. 
In northern latitudes the pole star is so near to the pole that 



296 



NAVIGATION 



observations of it can be taken at any time when it is visible, and 
from a convenient table given in the Nautical Almanac the altitude 
of the pole itself (which equals the latitude) is readily obtained. 

Longitude at sea is in modern navigation always found by com- 
paring local or ship mean time with Greenwich mean time, the latter 
being accurately known from the chronometers and the former from 
astronomical observations of suitably placed heavenly bodies. It 
may be assumed in all well found modern ships that on applying the 
known errors and accumulated rates to the times shown by the 
chronometers the Greenwich time at any instant is practically 
accurately known, and as the distance east or west of any place is 
merely the difference between the two local times at any instant ex- 
pressed in degrees, so also is the distance east or west of Greenwich 
(longitude) the difference between time at place and Greenwich time 
at any one instant. The connexion between time and degrees depends 
upon the complete rotation of the earth in twenty-four hours, causing 
meridians 15 apart to pass under the same fixed point in the heavens 
at intervals of one hour, those east of Greenwich passing earlier and 
those west later, resulting in local time being in advance of Greenwich 
time in cast longitude and vice versa in west longitude. 

The errors and rates of gaining or losing of the chronometer re- 
ferred to are known from observations made on shore prior to the 
beginning of the voyage with a sextant and artificial horizon, and 
these observations are capable of almost as great accuracy as those 
taken at fixed astronomical observatories. As this knowledge is 
absolutely essential every opportunity is taken at each principal port 
visited of either repeating such observations or obtaining the infor- 
mation from time balls dropped from observatories on shore at the 
Greenwich times indicated in the Time-ball pamphlet. Local or ship 
time can only be found with fair accuracy from calculations based on 
altitudes of heavenly bodies, when they are nearly east or west of the 
observer or technically on the prime vertical. Such times can be 
approximately seen from the azimuth diagrams or from tables of true 
bearings of heavenly bodies, and the error involved by uncertainty 
as to the position of the horizon can be greatly obviated in twilight or 
at night by taking the mean of results arising from nearly simultane- 
ous observations of bodies bearing both east and west. In the usual 
case of determining time by observations of the sun the results arising 
from morning observations are compared with those similarly ob- 
tained in the afternoon. It will of course be remarked that should 
any unallowed-for error in the chronometer exist it will affect the 
resulting longitude by its full amount. 

In considering the foregoing methods of astronomically fixing a 
ship's position we notice that always when the two elements of 
latitude and longitude are determined at different times, and gener- 
ally, as we shall presently see, when they are determined together 
(though usually for a shorter time) the navigator has to depend for 
some time on the accuracy of the course steered and estimated 
distance run; also when cloudy weather prevails he has to depend 
entirely on those elements for a knowledge of the ship's position. 
The frequent astronomical observation of the error of the compass is 
therefore a most important and fortunately simple duty. In practice 
the error is found by a comparison between the compass bearing of a 
heavenly body and its true bearing, obtained either by calculation, or 
more generally from a graphic diagram (Weir's azimuth diagram) or 
tables from which at practically any time when above the horizon the 
true bearings of the principal heavenly bodies are taken by in- 
spection. These important observations are most accurately made 
when the body observed is bearing nearly east or west true, if not 
too high, but if clouds prevent observations at such times, fairly good 
results can be obtained by observing the compass bearing when the 
object is on the meridian (if not too high) and therefore lying north 
or south true. 

The causes of the changing errors of a compass in an iron ship 
are described elsewhere (see Compass), but by making comparisons 
as above the navigator can at once ascertain what is termed the 
" total " error, and if he takes from that the portion of error due to 
the earth, or what is termed variation (known from a chart of such 
elements), the remaining error is that caused by the iron of- the ship, 
technically known as deviation. The latter method of procedure has 
the great advantage of enabling the navigator to ascertain during a 
voyage whatever magnetic changes in the ship are taking place other 
than those he would expect to occur on change of position. The 
total error is that applied to compass courses. 

Deviations greater than a few degrees are not merely inconvenient 
but in modern compasses produce unsteadiness or oscillation of the 
compass card, so that, especially in uew ships, the skilful navigator 
reduces such errors by adjusting the compensating magnets when 
favourable occasions offer. Recognizing the great value of a sound 
knowledge of compass adjustment, the British Board of Trade have 
included this among the compulsory subjects of examination for the 
rank of master, thus following the example of the navy, where all 
navigating officers have to attend a practical course of study on the 
subject. 

The practical problem of finding both latitude and longitude at the 
same time is the most important of all in modern navigation, and is 
rapidly superseding other modes of ascertaining a ship's position. 
The principle involved depends upon the fact that every heavenly 
body is at each particular instant of time directly overhead or in the 
zenith of some place on the earth. Thus, if we take the sun as an 



instance, it is noon at all places on the meridian of 60 ° W. when it is 
exactly 4 p.m. at Greenwich, and at the one spot on that meridian 
where the observer is as far north or south of the terrestrial equator 
as the sun is north or south of the celestial equator (declination) it will 
not only be noon but the sun will be immediately overhead and will 
have an altitude of 90 °. This, therefore, at any instant defines the 
position where the sun is vertical; its latitude must equal the sun's 
declination and its longitude in time equal the time since noon at 
Greenwich. Now at a distance of 60 m. in every direction on the 
surface of the earth from the point thus defined the sun will have an 
altitude of Sg° and in all directions at a distance of 1200 m. its 
altitude will be 70 ( = 90°— 20 ), so that on a globe, by marking the 
position where at a certain instant the sun is vertical and taking 
that as a centre, a series of concentric circles may be drawn, on all 
points of each of which the sun's altitude will be the same. When, 
therefore, at sea we measure with a sextant at any time the altitude 
of the sun (say 6o° io'J we at once know we are somewhere on the arc 
of a circle having for its centre the spot where the sun is vertical at 
that instant, and for radius a distance equal to 1790' ( = 90°— 6o° 10'). 
Such information, combined with the best and most recent knowledge 
we have of the ship's latitude at the time, will of itself afford valuable 
information as to the position, but by making two such observations, 
separated by a sufficiently long interval for the position having the 
sun vertical to have moved considerably (owing to the rotation of 
the earth), we are able to consider with certainty that we must be at 
one or other of the widely separated intersections of two such 
circles, the movement of the ship in the interval between the two 
observations being duly allowed for. The dead reckoning affords 
information as to which of these intersections is the true position. 

Now even on a large globe it would be practically impossible to 
obtain very accurate results from this problem by drawing such 
circles, but on a large scale chart (or ordinary squared paper) much 
greater accuracy is obtainable. The method commonly used on a 
Mercator chart involves two suppositions: (1) that the concentric 
circles we have referred to will be correctly represented as circles on 
the chart, and (2) that these are of such diameters, that a portion of 
say 100 m. of arc may be considered to be a straight line coincident 
with the tangent to the circle and therefore at right angles to the 
direction of the sun. Except in high latitudes (above 60 °) Mercator's 
projection fulfils the first condition sufficiently well for practical 
purposes, and, except when the altitude is greater than 70 °, the 
second condition is also approximately true since the radii of such 
circles will exceed 1200 m. 

Premising these conditions, suppose that on a certain day at 9 a.m. 
when the ship's approximate position, known from previous observa- 
tions and laid down on the ♦ 
chart, is supposed to be at A 
(fig. y), an observation of the 
sun is made from which the 
longitude is calculated, the 
result being that on the sup- 
position that the latitude of 
A is correct, the ship's position 
is probably at B. Now by 
drawing a straight line ab 
through B at rignt angles to 
the true bearing of the sun 
at the time of observation 
(which is most readily known 
from the azimuth tables) we , p 
are obviously right in assum- a' * ' 
ing the ship's position tc be somewhere on that line if we consider 
it as approximately an arc of a large circle having the place where 
the sun is then vertical as a centre, the direction of such place being 
indicated by an arrow. 

If our supposed latitude be right the position will be at B, but if 
not correct it must still be on the line ab, and if near land or any 
danger the direction of this line, even if no subsequent observation 
be available, will often give most valuable information. If, while 
waiting for the sun to change its bearing, the ship runs from B toC, 
a line cd drawn through C parallel to ab will represent an arc on which 
the position lies when she is probably at C, which at tnis instant 
(10*30 a. m.) is the most probable position of the ship. 

If another observation of the sun for longitude is now made and 
the resulting position is D (lying of course in the same latitude as C), 
on drawing through D a line ef at ri^ht angles to the bearing of the 
sun (indicated by an arrow) we are right in assuming the position to 
be somewhere on such an arc as is represented by this line. 

Hence E, the intersection of the two arcs on which the position lies 
at the same instant, must be the true place when the last observation 
was taken at the supposed position D, the discrepancies being entirely 
due to the original unknown error in the assumed latitude of A, for 
had that been accurate the position on the original line ab would 
have been such that on laying off the course and distance from that 
position C would have coincided with E. 

Errors in the assumed latitude of as much in many cases as 30 m. 
will often be found to produce no practical difference in the resultant 
position, but of course the accuracy of the longitude found is entirely 
•dependent upon the chronometer, and in such cases as arise when the 
intersecting arcs make a small angle with each other 'great accuracy

is required in the course and distance run between the times of 
observation. 

This method of finding both latitude and longitude at the same 
time is commonly known as " Sumner's " method from the publicity 
given to it in 1847 by the publication of an excellent pamphlet on the 
subject by a master of that name in the American mercantile marine, 
although in a modified form it was practised at a much earlier date 
in the British navy under the name of " cross bearings of the sun." 
Prior to the publication of azimuth tables in 1866 the calculation 
was more lengthy and troublesome, the work being practically 
doubled. 

We have taken an illustration from observations of the sun, but 
the method is^ obviously applicable to all heavenly bodies provided 
they are so^ situated that the arcs drawn will intersect at a good 
angle; this in twilight or at night-time is readily done by selecting 
two heavenly bodies whose bearings differ considerably, and in such 
cases the small complication of allowing for the run of the ship is 
often obviated by making the observations simultaneously. The 
armillary sphere or star globe is useful in selecting objects suitably 
situated. _ - 

The principle of Sumner's method has of recent years received a 
very important and valuable development under the name of the 
" new navigation." In this method, originally {proposed by Marc St 
Hilaire, a comparison is made between the altitude of a heavenly 
body as actually observed and that calculated from the supposed 
position of the ship. For instance, the position of an observer at the 
instant of observing a (true) altitude of the sun of 40 ° io' must be 
somewhere on a portion of the circumference of a circle (usually of 
such size that the portion considered may be represented on a chart 
by a straight line) having its centre in latitude equal to the sun's 
declination, and in longitude equal to the Greenwich apparent time 
at the instant, the radius of such a circle being equal to the sun's 
zenith distance of 49 50'. If at the same time the true altitude of 
the sun is from the estimated position of the ship calculated to be 
40 5', it is evident that the greater observed altitude must be owing 
to the ship being nearer to the centre of the circle than was supposed, 
and a line of position drawn through the estimated position at right 
angles to the bearing of the sun must be transferred parallel to itself 
through a distance of 5' towards the direction of the sun's bearing. 
The second line of position, obtained when the sun's bearing has 
altered some 25 , is dealt with in a similarway, and the intersection 
of the two lines so obtained gives the position of the ship at the time 
of second observation. This mode of procedure enables all observa- 
tions, whether near or far from the meridian, to be similarly dealt 
with; in all cases the altitude the heavenly body should have is 
computed and compared with what it actually has. The practice of 
problems such as the foregoing is greatly facilitated by the extended 
means of finding at any moment the azimuth or true bearing of a 
heavenly^ body. When the azimuth was only required for the de- 
termination of compass error, the valuable tables from which the 
computed results could be obtained by inspection were limited to 
those cases of most practical importance, but from the ingenious and 
simple graphical form known as Weir's azimuth diagram azimuths 
of all heavenly bodies, whose declinations extend from 6o° N. to 
6o° S., can be obtained during the whole time they are above the 
horizon, thus greatly facilitating the laying down lines of oosition. 

A careful record of everything pertaining to the navigation of the 
ship, with the results of all observations and calculated positions, is 
kept in the ship'slog, an official book of great importance, a rough 
original of which is kept on deck with entries made in it of all such 
events at the time of their occurrence. A copy of the headings of a 
page of this as transferred into the official log is here given :

u The course entered here is that which would be indicated by the 
" standard " compass of the ship (placed in the most favourable 
magnetic position on board); that actually steered by is the one 
most conveniently seen by the helmsman. Comparisons between 
the latter and the " standard " are frequently made, their indications 
generally varying somewhat owing to the difference of deviation in 
different positions on the ship. The compass card is usually gradu- 
ated into points and degrees, but the course is always estimated in 
degrees. The speed is ascertained from the indication of the patent 
log, the hand log being generally only used as a rough check on this. 
Wind direction and force are the result of estimation ; as the speed 
and course of the ship so greatly affect the apparent direction and 
velocity no practical anemometer for use on board ship exists. Wind 
force is estimated in terms of what is known as the " Beaufort " 
scale, based on the supposed amount of sail a vessel could carry at 
the time. The height of the mercurial barometer is carefully read at 
the end of each watch, as also is the thermometer; the more sensitive 
aneroid barometer is kept in a very accessible position and more 
Jrequcntly referred to by the officer of the watch. When navigating 
in localities and during seasons at which circular storms or hurricanes 



may be expected (as known from the Barometer Manual) the baro- 
meter is anxiously and frequently watched, and at all times its indi- 
cation is compared with that normally experienced in the locality 
traversed as shown on the barometer charts, due allowance being 
made in the tropics for the ordinary daily movement. All observa- 
tions relating to ocean meteorology are of great service in the com- 
pilation and improvement of wind and current charts, and in many 
ships more extensive meteorological journals are voluntarily kept 
on forms supplied by the Meteorological Office. A knowledge of tnc 
temperature of the surface of the sea is often of great practical use in 
navigation as giving^ warning of _ change in direction of the surface 
ocean current, especially in localities where there exist near to each 
other warm and ccld currents setting in different directions, as, for 
instance, near the edge of the Gulf Stream. As an indication of the 
vicinity of ice such observations are usually much less trustworthy. 
On the completion of the calculations giving the ship's position 
at noon each day the results are tabulated in the ship's log on the

The course and distance made good each day are calculated by 
trigonometry betweenthe best determined positions at two successive 
noons, such positions in fine weather being always those determined 
astronomically, and the current being considered the difference in the 
positions at noon as determined astronomically and as calculated by 
dead reckoning since the previous noon; such differences, however, 
obviously include the errors of all kinds. The latitude and longitude 
found by dead reckoning are entered under that heading (D.R.). 
The astronomical positions of latitude and longitude (entered as 
" obs." or "by observation ") are very seldom both determined at 
noon, but are carried up or back to that instant by calculation from 
the intervening dead reckoning. The variation, allowed is taken 
from the published variation chart, on which the latest results of such 
observations are embodied at intervals of about ten years with the 
annual changes (as far as known) in different localities, thus enabling 
the navigator to obtain its value at intermediate dates. Finally the 
course and distance are calculated from the position of the ship at 
noon to either the port of destination or some prominent position or 
danger near to which the vessel must pass. This is enterea under the 
heading " true bearings and distance."

NAVIGATION LAWS. The laws grouped under this title are 
a branch rather of municipal law than of the general maritime 
law. They are based upon the right of a state to regulate the 
navigation of its own waters and to protect its own commerce. 
One of the most curious early books on the subject is Captain G. 
St Lo, England's Safetie or a Bridle lo Ike French King, proposing 
a sure Melhod for encouraging Navigalion (London, 2nd ed. 
1693). Navigation laws may be divided into two classes. The 
first class includes all laws designed to secure a commercial 
monopoly to the state which enacted them. In Great Britain 
the object was attained by the Navigation Acts, the earliest of 
which were those of 138 r and 1390, ordaining that no merchandise 
should be shipped out of the realm except in British ships on 
pain of forfeiture. The principal Navigation Act was that of 
1660 (Scottish, 1661, c. 45). Up to 1854 coasting trade was 
wholly restricted to British ships, and a British ship must have 
been navigated by a master who was a British subject, and by 
a crew of whom a certain proportion must have been British 
subjects. After 1854 the only relics of such restrictions were 
found in the provisions of the Customs Consolidation Act 1853, 
§ 324, by which, in order to secure reciprocity, prohibitions or 
restrictions may by order in council be imposed upon the ships 
of any country in which British ships are liable to similar pro- 
hibitions or restrictions. Subject to these exceptions, a foreign 
ship is in the same position as a British ship with regard to 
British trade. This right of foreign ships is expressly recognized 
by the Customs Law Consolidation Act 1876; by § 141 of that 
act foreign ships engaged in the coasting trade are not to be 
subject to higher rates than British ships. Any advantages 
which a British ship has, e.g. the right of claiming protection 
for her flag, the non-attachment to her of a maritime hen for 
necessaries supplied in a British port, are not directly connected 
with the policy under which the Navigation Acts have become 
obsolete. These advantages are not secured to a British ship 
until she is registered. United States law agrees with British ' 
in this respect. " The United States have imitated the policy 
of England and other commercial nations in conferring peculiar 
privileges upon American-built ships and owned by our own 
citizens. . . . The object of the Registry Acts is to encourage 
our own trade, navigation and shipbuilding by granting peculiar 
or exclusive privileges of trade to the flag of the United States, 
and by prohibiting the communication of those immunities 
to the shipping and mariners of other countries " (Kent, 
Comm. iii. 139). It may be noticed that an alien is generally 
incapable of becoming the owner of a ship. This incapacity was 
specially preserved in the case of British ships by the Naturaliza- 
tion Act 1870, § 14. 

The second class of navigation laws includes those which deal 
with the navigation of any waters over which a state has any 
control, and embraces all that is necessary for the due use of such 
waters, as rules of the road, management of harbours and light- 
houses, and licensing and control of pilots. Such laws may deal 
with (1) the high seas, (2) tidal waters other than the high seas, 
(3) non-tidal waters. 

1. The claims of various nations to dominion over parts of the high 
seas have now become matters of merely historical interest. Such 
claims have been at different times advanced by Great Britain, 
Holland, Spain and Portugal, and were once sufficiently important 



to evoke the Mare Liberum of Grotius and the Mare Clausum of 
John Selden. It may be noted that in 1893 the Court of Arbitration 
on the Bering Sea Fisheries found that Russia had never claimed or 
exercised exclusive jurisdiction over the Bering Sea outside terri- 
torial waters and that the United States had no further right than 
had Russia at the time of the cession of Alaska in 1867. Rules for 
the navigation of the high seas may still be promulgated by any 
government. In Great Britain such rules, generally known as the 
" Sailing Rules," have been made by order in council under the 
powers of the Merchant Shipping Act 1862; the rules at present in 
Force are those contained in the order of the 27th of November 1896, 
L.G. No. 1082, as amended by subsequent orders in council. The 
order of 1896 was extended by the order of 1897, L.G. No. 572, to the 
ships of most foreign countries, with a special provision as to China. 
In the case of a state which has not assented to them, the only rules 
enforceable are the general rules of the sea, gradually ascertained by 
individual cases before courts of admiralty. 

2. For the navigation of its tidal waters — as far as they are 
territorial — a state ma^ legislate without the assent of other states. 
An example of such legislation is afforded by the Territorial Waters 
Jurisdiction Act 1878, a measure passed in consequence of the 
celebrated case of R. v. Keyn, L.R. 2 Ex. D., 126 (the *' Franconia " 
case), in 1876. Under the head of territorial waters would fall the 
" narrow seas " (as the Bristol Channel, Great Belt or Straits of 
Messina), bays and harbours, estuaries and arms of the sea, navigable 
tidal rivers, and the sea for. the distance of a marine league from the 
shore. Such waters being res publicae though not res communes, as 
are the high seas, are prima facie subject to the jurisdiction of the 
state. In England the soil under such waters, or at least under all but 
the last kind, is prima facie vested in the crown, subject to the public 
rights of fishery and anchorage. For the distance of a marine league 
from low-water mark the crown has certainly jurisdiction for police 
and revenue purposes. This is a rule of general international law. 
It may be noted that the Institut de Droit International proposed to 
double this limit. See Hall, International Law Qjth ed.), p. 154. In 
England the navigation of most of the principal tidal waters is 
governed by rules contained in acts of parliament and orders in 
council, the latter for the most part promulgated under the authority 
given by the Merchant Shipping Act 1862. For instance, there are 
numerous orders relating to the Thames, Mersey, Tees and other 
important rivers. 

3. Non-tidal waters, even though navigable, are in Great Britain 
prima facie private waters, in which the right of navigation does not 
exist as a public franchise, but can only be acquired by prescription 
founded on a presumed grant by an owner. In Roman law and in 
the Code Napoleon it is otherwise. Navigable rivers in those systems 
are always publici juris, whether tidal or norf-tidal. Navigation of 
non-tidal waters in the United Kingdom, whether natural or artificial, 
is now almost entirely regulated by various Navigation and Con- 
servancy Acts, e.g, the Thames Conservancy Acts, the Shannon, 
Trent, Lee, &c, Navigation Acts, and the various Canal Acts, 
especially the Manchester Ship Canal Act 1885. It may be noticed 
that the crown is empowered by the Merchant Shipping Act 1862 
to make rules for the navigation of inland waters, even when artificial, 
on the application of the proprietors. Examples of such rules are 
the orders in council regulating the Mersey and Irwell navigation and 
the Bridgewater navigation, 18th May 1870. Such waters being 
private property, the application for the rules by the proprietors is 
recited in the order in council. 

The distinction drawn in the United States between navigable and 
boatable rivers seems to be peculiar to that country, unless indeed it 
is analogous to the " fleuves et rivieres navigables ou fiottables " of 
the Code Napoleon, § 538. It is at least unknown in Great Britain. 

Remedies for Obstruction and Pollution. — These^ may be either 
criminal or civil — the criminal by indictment or information, the 
civil by action for damages or for an injunction, in addition to the 
criminal remedy, where special damage has been sustained. Pollu- 
tion is expressly provided for by the Rivers Pollution Prevention 
Act 1876, which gives jurisdiction to county courts in cases within 
the act. 

International Law. — The international law as to the navigation of 
the high seas has been sketched above. Reference should also be 
made to what is known as the " Rule of the War of 1756 " to the 
effect that where a colonial or coasting trade is prohibited to other 
nations in time of peace, a neutral by engaging in this trade by 
permission of a belligerent in time of war is liable to the other 
belligerent. The leading case is The Immanuel (1799). 2 C. 
Robinson's Rep. 186. Regulations for the coasting trade may be 
made by the government of India under the powers of the Customs 
Consolidation Act 1853, § 329, and by the legislature of a British 
possession under the Merchant Shipping Act 1894, § 736. Asto 
territorial waters, it is the general though not the universal opinion 
of jurists that the state to which the territorial waters belong has a 
right to forbid their navigation by foreigners. The free navigation of 
rivers has often been the subject of treaties, almost necessarily so 
where a river is the boundary between two states. In such a case, 
if a state were to maintain the strict letter of its rights, navigation 
would be almost impossible, as each state is proprietor down to the 
middle line of the bed of the river, the medium filum aquae or thalweg.

By* the treaty of Vienna in 1815 it was provided that the navigation 
of all rivers separating or traversing the states that were parties 
thereto should be open for commercial purposes to the vessels of all 
nations, subject to a uniform system of police and tolls. The treaty 
of Paris, 1856, extended this principle to the Danube. In America 
the cases of the Mississippi and the St Lawrence are important. ' By 
the treaty of Versailles, 1783, it was provided that " the navigation of 
the Mississippi shall for ever remain free and open to the subjects 
of Great Bntain and the citizens of the United States." But the 
United States afterwards acquired Louisiana and Florida; and, the 
stipulation as to British subjects not being renewed in the treaty of 
Ghent, 1814, the United States maintains that the right of navigat- 
ing the Mississippi is vested exclusively in its citizens. As to the St 
Lawrence, after disputes for a long period between Great Britain and 
the United States, the right of free navigation for purposes of 
commerce was secured to the United States by the treaty of Washing- 
ton, 1871. There are some waters, such as the Suez Canal and the 
Panama Canal, which are subject to peculiar engagements by treaty 
or convention. The former depends on the Convention of Con- 
stantinople, 29th of October 1888, the latter — as far as regards the 
United Kingdom and the United States — on the Hay-Pauncefote 
Treaty, 18th of November 1901. But as a rule it may be said that in 
time of peace the territorial waters of a state are open to foreigners 
for commercial purposes, subject to observance of any rules as to 
police, pilotage, &c, imposed by the state. Tolls may be imposed by 
the state upon foreigners. This right is expressly recognized in most 
commercial treaties. A notable instance was the claim of Denmark 
to charge what were called the " Sound dues " from all vessels passing 
Elsinore, though the Sound was not strictly her territorial water. 
The right was not universally recognized, though it had prescription 
in its favour and was invariably paid. In 1857 the dues were 
abolished, and compensation paid to Denmark for the loss of her 
alleged right. (J. W.) 

NAVIUS, ATTUS, in Roman legendary history, a famous 
augur during the reign of Tarquinius Priscus. When the latter 
desired to double the number of the equestrian centuries, Navius 
opposed him, declaring that it must not be done unless the 
omens were propitious, and, as a proof of his powers of divination, 
cut through a whetstone with a razor. Navius's statue with 
veiled head was afterwards shown in the comitium; the whet- 
stone and razor were buried in the same place, and a puteal 
placed over them. Hard by was a sacred fig-tree, called after 
him the Navian fig-tree. It was reported that Navius was subse- 
quently put to death by Tarquinius. According to Schwegler, 
the puteal originally indicated that the place had been struck 
by lightning, and the story is a reminiscence of the early struggle 
between the state and ecclesiasticism. 

See Livy 1. 36; Dion. Halic. iii. 70; Aurelius Victor,* De viris 
illuslribus, 6; Schwegler, Romische Geschichte, bk. xv. 16. 

NAVVY, a labourer employed in the digging and excavating 
of earth, &c, in the construction of railways, docks, canals or 
other engineering operations. The word is a shortened form of 
" navigator," applied, during the 18th and early part of the 19th 
centuries to a labourer at work on canals, to which the name 
" navigation " is often applied. Power-machines (excavators) 
for performing such work are consequently known as " steam- 
navvies." 

NAVY and NAVIES. The navy of a country was in its 
original meaning the total body of its shipping, whether used 
for war, for oversea and coasting traffic, or for fishing — the 
total in fact of its ships (Lat. naves). By custom, however, the 
word has come to be used only of that part of the whole which 
is set aside for purposes of war and police. Every navy consists 
of a material part (see Ship), i.e. the vessels, with their means 
of propulsion and their armament, and of a human organization, 
namely the crews of all ranks, by which the vessels are handled. 
Ships and men are combined in divisions, and are ruled by an 
organ of the government to which they belong (see Admiralty 
Administration). 

Personnel 

The personnel of the British navy is composed of two different 
bodies of men, the seamen and the marines, each of which has its 
appropriate officers. The marines are the subject of a separate 
article. 

The officers of the navy are classed as follows in the order of their 
rank^ flag-officers (see Admiral), commodores, captains, staff 
captains, commanders, staff commanders, lieutenants, navigating 
lieutenants, sub-lieutenants, chief gunners, chief boatswains, chief 
carpenters, gunners, boatswains, carpenters, midshipmen, naval 

Flag-officers are divided into three ranks, viz. rear-admiral, vice- 



admiral, admiral. There is also the rank of " admiral of the fleet ": 
such an officer, if in command, would carry the union flag at the main. 

All flag-officers, commanders-in-chief, are considered as responsible 
for the conduct of the fleet or squadron under their command. They 
are bound to keep them in perfect condition for service; to exercise 
them frequently in forming orders of sailing and lines of battle, and 
in performing all such evolutions as may occur in the presence of an 
enemy; to direct the commanders of squadrons and divisions to 
inspect the state of each ship under their command ; to see that the 
established rules for good order, discipline and cleanliness are ob- 
served; and occasionally to inquire into these and other matters 
themselves. They are required to correspond with the secretary of 
the admiralty, and report to him all their proceedings. 

Every flag-officer serving in a fleet, but not commanding it, is 
required to superintend all the ships of the squadron or division 
placed under his orders — to see that their crews are properly 
disciplined, that all orders are punctually attended to, that the 
stores, provisions and water are kept as complete as circumstances 
will admit, that the seamen and marines are frequently exercised, 
and that every precaution is taken for preserving the health of their 
crews. When at sea, he is to take care that every ship in his division 
preserves her station in whatever line or order of sailing the fleet 
may be formed; and in battle he is to observe attentively the 
conduct of every ship near him, whether of the squadron or division 
under his immediate command or not; and at the end of the battle 
he is to report it to the commander-in-chief, in order that commenda- 
tion or censure may be passed, as the case may appear to merit; and 
he is empowered to send an officer to supersede any captain who may 
misbehave in battle, or whose ship is evidently avoiding the en- 
gagement. If any flag-officer be killed in battle his flag is to be kept 
flying, and signals to be repeated, in the same manner as if he were 
still alive, until the battle shall be ended; but the death of a flag- 
officer, or his being rendered incapable of attending to his duty, is to 
be conveyed as expeditiously as possible to the commander-in-chief. 

The captain of the fleet is a temporary rank, where a commander- 
in-chief has ten or more ships of the line under his command ; it may 
be compared with that of adjutant-general in the army. He may 
either be a flag-officer or one of the senior captains; in the former 
case, he takes his rank with the flag-officers of the fleet ; in the latter, 
he ranks next to the junior rear-admiral, and is entitled to the pay 
and allowance of a rear-admiral. All orders of the commander-in- 
chief are issued through him, all returns of the fleet are made through 
him to the commander-in-chief, and he keeps a journal of the pro- 
ceedings of the fleet, which he transmits to the admiralty. He is 
appointed and can be removed from this situation only by the lords 
commissioners of the admiralty. 

A commodore is a temporary rank, and of two kinds — the one 
having a captain under him in the same ship, and the other without a 
captain. The former has the rank, pay and allowances of a rear- 
admiral, the latter the pay and allowances of a captain and special 
allowance as the lords of the admiralty may direct. They both carry 
distinguishing pennants. 

When a captain is appointed to command a ship of war he com- 
missions the ship by hoisting his pennant; and if fresh out of the 
dock, and from the hands of the dockyard officers, he proceeds im- 
mediately to prepare her for sea, by demanding her stores, provisions, 
guns and ammunition from the respective departments, according 
to her establishment. He enters such petty officers, leading seamen, 
able seamen, ordinary seamen, artificers, stokers, firemen and boys 
as may be sent to him from the flag or receiving ship. If he be 
appointed to succeed the captain of a ship already in commission, he 
passes a receipt to the said captain for the ship's books, papersand 
stores, and becomes responsible for the whole of the remaining stores 
and provisions. 

The duty of the captain of a ship, with regard to the several books 
and accounts, pay-books, entry, musters, discharges, &c, is regulated 
by various acts of parliament; but the state of the internal discipline, 
the order, regularity, cleanliness and the health of the crews will 
depend mainly on himself and his officers. In all these respects the 
general printed orders for his guidance contained in the King's 
Regulations and Admiralty Instructions are particularly precise and 
minute. And, for the information of the ship's company, he is 
directed to cause the articles of war, and abstracts of all acts of 
parliament for the encouragement of seamen, and all such orders and 
regulations for discipline as may be established, to be hung up in 
some public part of the ship, to which the men may at all times have 
access. He is also to direct that they be read to the ship's company, 
all the officers being present, once at least in every month. He is 
desired to be particularly careful that the chaplain have shown to 
him the attention and respect due to his sacred office by all the 
officers and men, and that divine service be performed every Sunday. 
He is not authorized to inflict summary punishment on any com- 
missioned or warrant-officer, but he may place them under arrest, 
and suspend any; officer who shall misbehave, until an opportunity 
shall offer of trying such officer by a court-martial. He is enjoined 
to be very careful not to suffer the inferior officers or men to be 
treated with cruelty and oppression by their superiors. He is the 
authority who can order punishment to be inflicted, which he is 
never to do without sufficient cause, nor ever with greater severity 
than the offence may really deserve, nor until twenty-four hours after

the crime has been committed, which must be specified in the warrant 
ordering the punishment. He may delegate this authority to a 
limited extent to certain officers. All the officers and the whole 
ship's company are to be present at every punishment, which must 
be inserted in the log-book, and an abstract sent to the admiralty 
every quarter. 

The commander has the chief command in small vessels. In larger 
vessels he is chief of the staff to the captain and assists him in main- 
taining discipline, and in sailing and fighting the ship. 

The lieutenants take the watch by turns, and are at such times 
entrusted, in the absence of the captain, with the command of the 
ship. The one on duty is to inform the captain of all important 
occurrences which take place during his watch. He is to see that the 
whole of the duties of the ship are carried on with the same punctu- 
ality as if the captain himself were present. In the absence^ of the 
captain, the commander or senior executive officer is responsible for 
everything done on board. 

The navigating officer receives his orders from the captain or the 
senior executive officer. He is entrusted, under the command of the 
captain, with the charge of navigating the ship, bringing her to 
anchor, ascertaining the latitude and longitude of her place at sea, 
surveying harbours, and making such^ nautical remarks and observa- 
tions as may be useful to navigation in general. 

The warrant-officers of the navy may he compared with the non- 
commissioned officers of the army. They take rank as follows, viz. 
gunner, boatswain, carpenter; and, compared with other officers, 
they take rank after sub-lieutenants and before midshipmen.- 

The midshipmen are the principal subordinate officers, but have no 
specific duties assigned to them. In the smaller vessels some of the 
senior ones are entrusted with the watch; they attend parties of 
men sent on shore, pass the word of command on board, and see that 
the orders of their superiors are carried into effect ; in short, they are 
exercised in all the duties of their profession, so as, after five years' 
service as cadets and midshipmen, to qualify them to become 
lieutenants, and are then rated sub-lieutenants provided they have 
passed the requisite examination. 

The duties and relative positions of these officers remain practi- 
cally unaffected by recent changes; but a profound modification was 
made in the constitution of the corps of officers at the close of 1902. 
Up to the end of that year, officers who belonged to the " executive " 
branch, ue. from midshipmen to admiral, to the marines and the 
engineers, had entered at different ages, had been traineo*in separate 
schools, and had formed three co-operating but independent lines. 
For reasons set forth in a memorandum by Lord Selborne (December 
16, 1902) — from the desire to give a more scientific .character 
to naval education, and to achieve complete unity among all classes 
of officers — it was decided to replace the triple by a single system of 
entry, and to coalesce all classes of officers, apart from the purely 
civil lines — surgeons and paymasters (formerly " pursers ") — into 
one. Lads were in future to be entered together, and at ope training 
establishment at Osborne in the Isle of Wight, on the distinct under- 
standing that it was to be at the discretion of the admiralty to assign 
them to executive, marine or engineer duties at a later period. After 
two years' training at Osborne, and at the Naval College at Dart- 
mouth, all alike were to go through the rank of midshipman and to 
pass the same examination for lieutenant. When in the intermediate 
position of sub-lieutenant, they were to be assigned to their respec- 
tive branches as executive officer, marine or engineer. The engineers 
under this new system were to cease to be a civil branch, as they had 
been before, and become known as lieutenant, commander, captain 
or rear-admiral E. (Engineer). 

The crew of a ship of war consistsof leading seamen, able seamen, 
ordinary seamen, engine-room artificers, other artificers, leading 
stokers, stokers, coal-trimmers, boys and marines. The artificers 
and stokers and the marines are always entered voluntarily, the 
latter in the same manner as soldiers, by enlisting into the corps, the 
former at some rendezvous or on board particular ships. The supply 
of boys for the navy, from whom the seamen class of men and petty 
officers is recruited, is also obtained by voluntary entry. 

Merchant seamen arc admitted into the royal naval reserve, receive 
an annual payment by way of retainer, perform drill on board His 
Majesty's ships, and are engaged to serve in the navy in case of war 
or emergency. 

There are two schemes for forming reserves. The Royal Naval 
Reserve^ scheme draws men from the mercantile marine and fishing 
population of the United Kingdom. The Royal Fleet Reserve 
scheme, introduced in 1901, whileit gave a better system of training 
to the pensioners, was mainly designed to obtain the services in war 
of the men who had quitted the navy after the expiration of their 
twelve years' service. 

So far as other countries are concerned, the staff of officers does not 
differ materially from one navy to another. In all it consists of 
admirals, captains, lieutenants, midshipmen and cadets receiving 
their training in special schools. With the exception of the navy of 
the United States, all the important naval forces of the world are 
raised by conscription. 

The strength and general condition of navies at any given time 
must be learnt from the official publications of the various powers, 
and from privately composed books founded on them. The yearly 
statements of the First Lord of the Admiralty in Great Britain, the 



Reports of the Secretary of the Navy in the United States, and the 
Reports of the Budget Committees of the French-Chamber contain 
masses of information. The Naval Annual, founded by Lord Brassey 
in 1886, is the model of publications which appear in nearly every 
country which possesses a navy. MrF. T. jane's All the World's 
Fighting Ships is a survey of the materiel of navies since 1898. 

History of Navies 

Every navy was at its beginning formed of the fighting men 
of the tribe, or city, serving in the ship or large boat, which was 
used indifferently for fishing, trade, war or piracy. The develop- 
ment of the warship as a special type, and the formation of 
organized bodies of men set aside for military service on the sea 
came later. We can follow the process from its starting-point 
in the case of the naval powers of the dark and middle ages, 
the Norsemen, the Venetians, the French, the English fleet and 
others. But centuries, and indeed millenniums, before the 
modern world emerged from darkness the nations of antiquity 
who lived on the shores of the Mediterranean had formed 
navies and had seen them culminate and decline. The adven- 
tures of the Argonauts and of Ulysses give a legendary and 
poetic picture of an " age of the Vikings " which was coming 
to an end two thousand years before the Norsemen first vexed 
the west of Europe. At a period anterior to written history 
necessity had dictated the formation of vessels adapted to the 
purposes of the warrior. Long ships built for speed {fxaKpal jjtjcs, 
naves longae) as distinguished from round ships for burden 
(orpoyyvkat Wjes, naves onerariae) are of extreme antiquity 
(see Ship). Greek tradition credited the Corinthians with the 
invention, but it is probable that the Hellenic peoples, in this 
as in other respects, had a Phoenician model before them. So 
little is known of the other early navies, whether Hellenic or 
non-Hellenic, that we must be content to take the Athenian 
as our example of them all, with a constant recognition of the 
fact that it was certainly the most highly developed, and that 
we cannot safely argue from it to the rest. 

The Athenian navy began with the provision of warships 
by the state, because private citizens could not supply them 
in sufficient numbers. The approach of the Persian 
attack in 483 B.C. drove Athens to raise its establish- 
ment from 50 to 100 long ships, which were paid for out of 
the profits of the mines of Moroneia (see Themistocles). The 
Persian danger compelled the Greeks to form a league for their 
common naval defence. The League had its first headquarters 
at Delos, where its treasury was guarded and administered by 
the % EXh}vorafjLiai (Hellenotamiai), or trustees of the Hellenic 
fund. Her superiority .in maritime strength gave Athens a 
predominance over the other members of* the League like that 
which Holland enjoyed for the same reason in the Seven United 
Provinces. The Hellenotamiai were chosen from among her 
citizens, and Pericles transferred the fund to Athens, which 
became the mistress of the League. The allies sank in fact to 
subjects, and their contributions, aided by the produce of the 
mines, went to the support of the Athenian navy. The hundred 
long ships of the Persian War grew to three hundred by the end 
of the 5th century b.c. (see Peloponnesian War), and at a 
later period (when, however, the quality of ships and men alike 
had sunk) to three hundred and sixty. The ancient world did 
not attain to the formation of a civil service — at least until the 
time of the Roman Empire — and Athens had no admiralty 
or navy office. In peace the war-vessels were kept on slips under 
cover in sheds. In war a slralegos was appointed to the general 
command, and he chose the trierarchs, whose duty it was to 
commission them partly at their own expense, under supervision 
of the state exercised by special inspectors (dTroaroXets). The 
hulls, oars, rigging and pay of the crews were provided by the 
state, but it is certain that heavy charges fell upon the trierarchs, 
who had to fit the ships for sea and return them in good condi- 
tion. The burden became so heavy that the trierarchies were 
divided, first between two citizens in the Peloponnesian War, 
and then among groups (synleleiai) consisting of from five to 
sixteen persons. Individual Athenians who were wealthy and 
patriotic or ambitious might fit out ships or spend freely on

their command. But these voluntary gifts were insufficient 
to maintain a great navy. The necessity which compelled 
modern nations to form permanent state navies, instead of 
relying on a levy of ships from the ports, and such vessels as 
English nobles and gentlemen sent to fight the Armada, prevailed 
in Athens also. The organization of the crews bore a close 
resemblance in the general lines to that of the English navy as 
it was till the 16th and even the 17th century. The trierarch v 
either the citizen named to discharge the duty, or some one whom 
he paid to replace him, answered to the captain. There was 
a sailing master (Kv&epvfjrris) , a body of petty officers, mariners 
and oarsmen (inrrjpeaia), with the soldiers or marines (e7rt/3drat). 
As the ancient warship was a galley, the number of rowers 
required was immense. A hundred triremes would require 
twenty thousand men in all, or more than the total number of 
crews of the twenty-seven British line of battleships which 
fought at Trafalgar. And yet this would not have been a great 
fleet, as compared with the Roman and Carthaginian forces, 
which contended with hundreds of vessels and multitudes of 
men, numbering one hundred and fifty thousand or so, on each 
side, in the first Punic War. 

Until the use of broadside artillery and the sail became 
universal at the end of the 16th century, all navies were forcibly 
organized on much the same lines as the Athenian, even in the 
western seas. In the Mediterranean the differences were in 
names and in details. The war fleets of the successors of 
Alexander, of Carthage, of Rome, of Byzantium, of the Italian 
republics, of the Arabs and of Aragon, were galleys relying on 
their power to ram or board. Therefore they present the same 
elements — a chief who is a general, captains who were soldiers, 
or knights, sailing masters and deck hands who navigate and 
tend the few sails used, marines and rowers. A few words may, 
however, be said of Rome, which transmitted the tradition of 
the ancient world to Constantinople, and of the Constantino- 
politan or Byzantine navy, which in turn transmitted the tradi- 
tion to the Italian cities, and had one peculiar point of interest. 

As a trading city Rome was early concerned in the struggle 
for predominance in the western Mediterranean between the 
Etruscans, the Greek colonies and the Carthaginians. 
Its care of its naval interests was shown by the appoint- 
ment of navy commissioners as early as 31 1 B.C. (Duoviri novates) . 
In the first Punic War it had to raise great fleets from its own 
resources, or from the dependent Greek colonies of southern Italy. 
After the fall of Carthage it had no opponent who was able to force 
it to the same efforts. The prevalence of piracy in the 1st century 
B.C. again compelled it to attend to its navy (see Pompey). The 
obligation to keep the peace on sea as well as on land required 
the emperors to maintain a navy for police purposes. The 
organization was very complete. Two main fleets, called the 
Praetorian, guarded the coasts of Italy at Ravenna and Misenum 
(classes Praetorian), other squadrons were stationed at Forum 
Julii (Frejus), Seleucia at the mouth of the Orontes (Nahr-el-Asy), 
called the classis Syriaca, at Alexandria (classis Augusta Alex- 
andrine), at Carpathos (Scarpanto, between Crete and Rhodes), 
Aquileia (the classis Venettim at the head of the Adriatic), 
the Blac^ Sea (classis Pontica), and Britain (classis Britannica). 
River flotillas were maintained on the Rhine (classis Germanica), 
on the Danube (classis Pannonica and Maesica) and in later days 
at least on the Euphrates. All these squadrons did not exist 
at the same time. The station at Forum Julii was given up 
soon after the reign of Augustus, and the classis Venetum was 
formed later. But an organized navy always existed. A body 
of soldiers, the classici, was assigned for its service. The 
commander was the Praefectus Classis. 

When Constantine founded his New Rome on the site of 
Byzantium, the navy of the Eastern Empire may be said to have 
Byzantine ^ )e ? un * * ts history is obscure and it suffered several 
* eclipses. While the Vandal kingdom of Carthage 
lasted (428-534), the eastern emperors were compelled to 
attend to their fleet. After its fall their navy fell into neglect 
till the rise of the Mahommedan power at the end of the 7th 
century again compelled them to guard their coasts. The 



eastern caliphs had fleets for purposes of conquest, and so had 
the emirs and caliphs of Cordova. The Byzantine navy reached 
its highest point under the able sovereigns of the Macedonian 
dynasty (867-1056). It was divided into the imperial fleet, 
commanded by the Great Drungarios, the first recorded lord high 
admiral, and the provincial or thematic squadrons, under their 
strategoi. Of these there were three, the Cibyrhaeotic (Cyprus 
and Rhodes), the Samian and the Aegean. The thematic 
squadrons were maintained permanently for police purposes. 
The imperial fleet, which was more powerful when in commission 
than all three, was kept for war. A peculiar feature of the 
Byzantine navy was the presence in it of a corps answering to the 
seaman gunners and gunnery officers of modern navies. These 
were the siphonarioi, who worked the siphons (vup&vts) used for 
discharging the " Greek fire." When the Turkish invasions 
disorganized the Eastern Empire in the 12th century, the 
Byzantine navy withered, and the emperors were driven to rely 
on the help of the Venetians. 

The Italian republics of the middle ages, and the monarchical 
states bordering on the Mediterranean, always possessed fleets 
which did not differ in essential particulars from that 
of Athens. There is, however, one fact which must not 
be overlooked. It is that the seamen of some of them, and 
more especially of Genoa, served the powers of western Europe 
from a very early date. Diego Gelmirez, the first archbishop of 
Santiago in Galiicia, employed Genoese to construct a dockyard 
and build a squadron at Vigo in the 12th century. 

Edward III. of England employed Genoese, and others were 
engaged to create a dockyard for the French kings at Rouen. 
By them the naval science of the Mediterranean was carried 
to the nations on the shores of the Atlantic. The Mediterranean 
navies made their last great appearance in history at the battle 
of Lepanto (1571). Thenceforth the main scene of naval activity 
was on the ocean, with very different ships, other armaments 
and organizations. 

The great navies of modern history may best be discussed by 
taking first certain specially important national navies in their 
earlier evolution, and then considering those which are of present 
day interest in their relations to one another. 

The British Navy. 

The Royal Navy of Great Britain stands at the head of the 
navies of the modern world, not only by virtue of its strength, 
but because it has the longest and the most consistent historical 
development. The Norse invasions of the 9th century forced the 
English people to provide for their defence against attack from 
oversea. Though their efforts were but partially successful, 
and great Norse settlements were made on the eastern side of 
the island, a national organization was formed. Every shire was 
called upon to supply ships " in proportion to the number of 
hundreds and from the produce of what had been the folkland 
contained in it " (Stubbs, Const. Hist. i. 116). Alfred and his 
successors had also ships of their own, maintained out of the 
royal revenue of which they had complete control. Before the 
Conquest the system of contribution by the shires had largely 
broken down. Yet in its main lines the method of providing a 
navy adopted by Alfred and his immediate successors remained 
in existence. There were the people's ships which represented the 
naval side of the fyrd — i.e. the general obligation to defend the 
realm; and there were the king's own vessels which were his 
property. By the nth century a third source of supply had 
been found. This was the feudal array. Towns on the sea coast 
were endowed with privileges and franchises, and rendered 
definite services in return. 

The Norman Conquest introduced no fundamental difference. 
In the 1 2th century the kings of the Angevine dynasty made the 
military resources of their kingdom available in three ways; 
the feudal array, the national militia and the mercenaries. 
Dover, Sandwich, Romney, and the other towns on the south- 
east coast which formed the Cinque Ports represented the naval 
part of the feudal array. In the reign of Henry III. (1216-1272) 
their service was fixed at 57 ships, with 1197 men and boys, for 



302 



NAVY AND NAVIES

fifteen days in any year, to count from the time when they weighed 
anchor. During these fifteen days they served at the expense 
of the towns. Beyond that date they were maintained by the 
king. The Cinque Ports Squadron has been spoken of as the 
foundation of the Royal Navy. But a feudal array is wholly 
alien in character to a national force. The Cinque Ports, after 
playing a prominent part in the 13th century, sank into in- 
significance. They were always inclined to piracy at the expense 
of other English towns. In 1297, during one of the expeditions to 
Flanders, they attacked and burnt twenty ships belonging to 
Yarmouth under the eyes of Edward I. (1 272-1307). The 
national militia had a longer life. The obligation of the coast 
towns and counties to provide ships and men for the defence 
of the realm was enforced till the 17th century. Nor did the 
method of enforcing that obligation differ materially. In the 
reign of King John (1100-1216), when the records began to be 
regularly kept, but when there was no radical change in system, 
the reeves and bailiffs of the seaports were bound to ascertain 
by a juryjhejiumber, size and quality of all ships belonging to 
the port. When the ships were required for the king's service 
they were embargoed. The local authorities were then bound 
to see that they were properly equipped and manned. It was 
the duty of the reeves and bailiffs to arrange that they should 
reach the place named by the king as rendezvous at the tune 
fixed by him. These embargoes inflicted heavy loss even when 
they were honestly imposed, and loud complaints were heard 
in Parliament from the later years of Edward III. (13 2 7-13 7 7) 
that they afforded the king's officers many openings for oppression 
and corruption. 

The true ancestors of the modern navy must be sought in 
the third element of the navy of the middle ages — the king's 
ships and his " mercenaries." Under King John we find the 
full record of a regular organization of a Royal Navy as apart 
from the feudal array of the Cinque Ports or the/y/J. In 1205 
he had in all 50 " galleys " — long ships for war-distributed in 
various ports. William of Wrotham, archdeacon of Taunton, 
one of the king's " clerks," or ecclesiastical persons who formed 
his civil service, is named, sometimes in combination with 
others, as " keeper of the king's ships," " keeper of the king's 
galleys " and " keeper of the king's seaports." The royal 
vessels cannot have differed from the 57 warships of the Cinque 
Ports, and at first his navy was preferable to the feudal array, 
or the levy from the counties, mainly because it was more fully 
under his own control. They were indeed so wholly his that 
he could hire them out to the counties, and at a much later 
period the ships of Henry V. (14 13-14 2 2) were sold to pay his 
personal debts after his death. Yet though the process by which 
the king's ships became the national navy was slow, the affilia- 
tion is direct from them to the fleet of to-day, while the permanent 
officials at Whitehall are no less the "direct descendants of 
William of Wrotham and the king's clerks of the 13th century. 
When on active service the command was exercised by repre- 
sentatives of the king, who were not required to be bred to the 
sea or even always to be laymen. In the crusade of 1190 the 
fleet of Richard the Lion Hearted (1180-1199), drawn partly 
from England and partly from his continental possessions, was 
governed by a body of which two of the members were church- 
men. They and their lay colleagues were described as the 
ductores et gubernatorcs totius navigii Regis. The first commanders 
of squadrons were known as justiciarii navigii Regis, ductores et 
constabularii Regis. 

The crusade of 11 90 doubtless made Englishmen acquainted 
with the title of "admiral"; but it was not till much later 
that the word became, first as " admiral and captain," then as 
" admiral " alone, the title of an officer commanding a squadron. 
The first admiral of all England was Sir John Beau champ, 
appointed for a year in 1360. The permanent appointment 
of a lord admiral dates from 1406, when John Beaufort, natural 
son of John of Gaunt, and marquess of Somerset and Dorset, 
was named to the post. The crews consisted of the two elements 
which, in varying proportions and under different names, have 
been and are common to all navies — the mariners whose business 



it was to navigate the ship, and the soldiers who were put in 
to fight. Until the vessel had been developed and the epoch of 
ocean voyages began, the first were few and subordinate. As 
the seas of Britain were ill adapted for the use of the galley 
in the proper sense, though the French employed them, English 
ships relied mainly on the sail. They used the oar indeed but 
never as a main resource, and had therefore no use .for the 
" turma " (ciurma in Italian, chiourme in French, and chusma 
in Spanish) of rowers formed in the Mediterranean craft. Crews 
were obtained partly by free enlistment, but also to a great 
extent, by the press (see Impressment). The code of naval 
discipline was the laws of Oleron (see Sea Laws), which embodied 
the general " custom of the sea." By the reign of Edward III. 
(13 27-1377) the duties and jurisdiction of the admiral were 
fixed. He controlled the returns of the ships made by the 
reeves, selected them for service, and chose his officers, who 
had their commission from him. A rudimentary code of signals 
by lights or flags was in use. 

The history of the middle ages bears testimony to the general 
efficiency and energy of the navy. Under weak kings, and at 
certain periods, for instance in the latter years of Edward III. 
and the reign of his grandson Richard II. (1377-1399), it fell 
into decay, and the coast was ravaged by the French and their 
allies the Basque seamen, who manned the navy of Castile. 
Henry IV. (1390-1413), though an astute and vigorous ruler, 
was driven to make a contract with the merchants, mariners 
and shipowners, to take over the duty of guarding the coast 
in 1 406-1 407. Their admirals Richard Clitherow and Nicholas 
Blackburne were appointed, and exercised their commands. 
But the experiment was not a success, and was not renewed. 
Apart from these periods of eclipse, the navy in all its elements, 
feudal, national and royal, was more than a match for its enemies. 
The destruction of the fleet prepared by Philip Augustus, the 
French king, for the invasion of England in 12 13 at Damme, 
the defeat of Eustace the Monk in 1217 off Dover, the victory 
over the French fleet at Sluys in 1340, and the defeat of the 
Spaniards off Winchelsea in 1350, were triumphs never quite 
counterbalanced by any equivalent overthrow. Still better 
proofs of the ability of any navy to discharge its duties 
\vere the long retention of Calais, and the constant success 
of the rulers of England in their invasions of France. The 
claim to the sovereignty of the seas has been attributed on 
insufficient evidence to King John, but it was enforced by 
Edward III. 

Under the sovereigns of the Tudor dynasty (1485-1603) the 
development of the navy was steady. Though Henry VII. 
(1485-1509) made little use of his fleet in war, he huilt ships. 
His son Henry VIII. (1 500-1 547) took a keen interest in his 
navy. Shipbuilding was improved by the. importation of Italian 
workmen. The large resources he obtained by the plunder of 
the Church enabled Henry VIII. to spend on a scale which had 
been impossible for his predecessors, and was to be impossible 
for his successors without the aid of grants from Parliament. 
But the most vital sendee which he rendered to the navy was the 
formation of, or rather the organization of existing officials 
into, the navy office. This measure was taken at the very end 
of his reign, when the board was constituted by letters patent 
dated 24th of April 1546. It consisted of a lieutenant of the 
admiralty, a treasurer, a comptroller, a surveyor, a clerk of the 
ships, and two officials without special title. A master of the 
ordnance for the ships was also appointed. Henry's board, 
commonly known as the navy board, continued, with some 
periods of suspension,' and with the addition of different de- 
partments — the victualling board, the transport board, the 
pay office, &c, added at various times — to be the administrative 
machinery of the navy till 1832. They were all theoretically 
subject to the authority of the lord high admiral, or the com- 
missioners for discharging his office, who had the military and 
political control of the navy and issued all commissions to its 
officers. In practice the boards were very independent. The 
double government of the navy, though it lasted long, was 
undoubtedly the cause of much waste — partly by the creation

of superfluous officials, hut more by the opening it provided 
for corruption. 

The 1 6th century in England as elsewhere saw a great develop- 
ment in the size and capacity of ships, in the length of voyages, 
and consequently in the sciences of navigation and seamanship, 
which brought with them the predominance of the seaman 
element hitherto subordinate. In the reign of Henry VIII., 
when a squadron was commissioned in 1512, out of a total of 
3000 men, 1750 were soldiers. By the end of the reign of his 
daughter Elizabeth (1558-1603) it was calculated that of the 
8 $46 men required to man her fleet 5534 were seamen, 804 
were gunners, and only 2008 were soldiers. In the early years 
of his reign Henry VIII. equipped his squadrons on a system 
which bears some resemblance to the Athenian trierarchies. 
He made a contract with his admiral Sir Edward Howard (1477- 
1513)? by which the king supplied ships, guns and a sum of 
money. The admiral, who had full power to " press," named the 
officers and collected the crews. Among them are named 
contingents from particular towns — the representatives of the 
fyrd. With the exception of the captain, who received eighteen 
pence a day, all were paid at the same rate, 5s. wages and 5s. for 
rations per month. Extra sums called " dead shares," the 
wages of so many imaginary men, and rewards, were provided 
for the master and warrant officers. Until the regular returns 
known as the " weekly progress of the dockyards" and the 
" monthly lists of ships in sea pay " were established in 1773, 
no constant strict account of the strength of the navy was kept. 
The figure must therefore be accepted as subject to correction, 
but King Henry's navy is estimated to have consisted of 53 
vessels of 11,268 tons, carrying 237 brass guns and 1848 of iron. 
It sank somewhat during the agitated reigns of his successors 
Edward VI. (1547-1553) and Mary (1553-1558). By Elizabeth 
it was well restored. In mere numbers her navy never equalled 
her father's. At the end of her reign it was composed of 42 
vessels, but they were of 17,055 tons, and therefore on the average 
much larger. The military services rendered by the great 
queen's fleet were brilliant. No organic change was introduced, 
and fleets continued to be made up by including vessels belonging 
to the different ports. 

The two most notable advances in organization were the 
establishment of a graduated scale of pay by rank in 1582, and 
the formation of a fund for the relief of sick and wounded 
seamen. This was not a grant from the state but a species of 
compulsory insurance. All men employed by the navy, including 
shipwrights, were subject to a small deduction from their pay. 
The amount was kept in the chest at Chatham, from which the 
fund took its name, and was managed by a committee of five, 
each of whom had a key, and of whom four were elected by the 
contributors. The commissioner of the dockyard presided. 

It was between the accession and the fall of the House of 
Stuart (1 603-1688) that the navy became a truly national force, 
maintained out of the revenue voted by parliament, and acting 
without the co-operation of temporary levies of trading ships. 
The reign of James I. (1603-1625) is a period of great importance 
in its history. The policy of the king was peaceful, and he only 
once sent out a strong fleet — in 1620 when an expedition was 
despatched against the Barbary pirates. He took, however, 
a lively interest in shipbuilding, and supported his master ship- 
wright Phineas Pett (1 507-1647) against the rivals whom he 
offended by disregarding their rules of thumb. Under the lax 
administration of the lord high admiral Nottingham, better 
known as Lord Howard of Effingham, many abuses crept into 
the navy. Though more money was spent on it than in the 
reign of the queen, it had sunk to a very low level of effective 
strength in 1618. In 1619 the old lord admiral was persuaded 
to retire, and was succeeded by George Villiers, duke of Bucking- 
ham, the king's favourite. Nottingham's retirement was made 
compulsory by the report of a committee appointed to inquire 
into the condition of the navy in 1618. They reported that 
while numbers of new offices had been created at a cost treble 
the whole expense of the permanent staff of Queen Elizabeth's 
time, the dockyards had become nests of pilfering and corruption. 



Ships were rotting, and money was yearly drawn for vessels 
which had ceased to exist. The committee undertook to meet 
the whole ordinary and extraordinary charges of the navy 
(upkeep and new building) for £30,000 a year. The ships in 
commission at that time during peace were confined to the 
diminutive winter and summer guards, whose duty was to 
transport ambassadors to and fro across the Channel and to 
hunt the pirates who still swarmed on the coast. Buckingham 
left the administration of the navy in the hands of the com- 
missioners, who by dismissing superfluous officers and paying 
better salaries had by 1624 fulfilled their promise to restore 
the fleet. The establishment they proposed was only of 30 ships, 
but they were larger in aggregate tonnage by 3050 tons than 
Queen Elizabeth's. 

Charles I. (162 5-1 649) carried on the work of his father as far 
as his limited resources allowed. The pay of the sailors, fixed 
in 1585 at 1 os., was increased to 15s. A captain received from 
£4, 6s. 8d. a month of 28 days (the standard of the navy) to £14, 
according to the size of his ship. Lieutenants, who were only 
carried in the larger ships, received from £2, 16s. to £3, 10s., the 
sailing-master from £2, 6s. 8d. to £4, 13s. 9d., and the warrant 
officers from £1, 3s. to £2, 4s. The rating of ships by the number 
of men carried was introduced in this reign. Vessels of good 
quality were built for the king, and he showed a real understand- 
ing of the necessity for maintaining a strong fleet. 

But the time was coming when the hereditary royal revenue 
was no longer adequate to meet the expense of a navy. By the 
middle of the 17th century a costly warship, far larger than the 
trading-ship in size and much more strongly built, had been 
developed. The extension of British commerce called for 
protection which an establishment of 40 to 50 vessels could not 
give. When the Great Rebellion broke out in 1641 the navy 
of King Charles consisted of only 42 vessels of 22,411 tons. At 
the Restoration (1660) it had grown to 154 ships for sea service, 
of 57,463 tons. Such a force could only be maintained out of 
taxes granted by the parliament. The efforts of King Charles 
to obtain funds for his navy had a large influence in provoking 
the rebellion (see Ship Money). The government of the navy 
during this reign remained in the hands of the committee of 
1618, under the lord high admiral Buckingham, till he was 
murdered in 1628. It was then entrusted to a special commission, 
who were to have held it till the king's second son James, duke 
of York, was of age. In 1638 the king restored the office of lord 
high admiral " during pleasure " in favour of Algernon Percy, 
10th earl of Northumberland, by whom the fleet was handed 
over to the parliament. 

During the Great Rebellion and the Protectorate the navy 
was governed by parliamentary committees, or by a committee 
named by the Council of State, or by Cromwell. The need, 
first for cutting the king off from foreign support, and then for 
conducting successive struggles in Ireland, or with the king's 
partisans on the sea, with the Dutch and with the Spaniards 
during the Protectorate, led to a great increase in its size. These, 
too, were years of much internal development. Blake and the 
other parliamentary officers found that the pressed or hired 
merchant ships were' untrustworthy in action. The ships were 
not strong enough, and the officers had no military spirit. 
Parliament therefore provided its own vessels and its own 
officers. The staff was strengthened by the appointment of 
second lieutenants. The Dutch War of 1652-53 may be said 
to have seen the last of the national militia, fyrd or levy of ships 
from the ports for warlike purposes. After the war a code of 
" fighting instructions " was issued. During it a cede of discipline 
in 39 articles was established. Both embodied ancient practices 
rather than new principles, yet it marked a notable advance in 
the progress of the navy towards complete organization that 
it should pass from the state of being governed by traditional 
use and wont, or by the will of the commander for the time 
being, to the condition of being ruled by fixed and published 
codes to which all were subject. The high military command 
during the interregnum 1640-1660 was entrusted to committees 
of admirals and generals at sea.

NAVY AND NAVIES 



[BRITISH 



With the restoration of Charles II. (1660-1685) the modern 
period in the history of the navy began. The first steps were 
taken to form a corps of officers. Lads of gentle birth were 
sent on board ships in commission with a letter of service — from 
which came their popular name of " king's letter boys " — to 
the captain, instructing him to treat them on the footing of 
gentlemen and train them to become officers. After the Dutch 
War of 1664-67 a body of flag-officers were retained by fixed 
allowances from the crown. This was the beginning of the half- 
pay list, which was extended by successive steps to include 
select bodies of captains and lieutenants, and then all com- 
missioned officers. The process of forming the corps was not 
complete till the end of the reign of Queen Anne (1702-1714). 
Special training and a right to permanent payment are the 
essentials of a state service. The fleet was, at least in the earlier 
part of the reign, used for the promotion of British interests and 
the protection of trade in distant seas. One squadron was sent 
to take possession of Bombay, which formed part of the dower 
of Queen Catherine. Tangier, which was acquired in the same 
way, was occupied as a naval station till the cost of maintaining 
it proved excessive and it was evacuated in 1685. A series 
of effective attacks was made on the Barbary pirates, and ships 
were stationed in the West Indies to check piracy and buccaneer- 
ing. Until 1673, when he was driven out of office by the Test 
Act, the king's brother James, duke of York, afterwards James 
II., held office as lord high admiral. He proved an able admini- 
strator. The navy office was thoroughly organized on the lines 
laid down by the earl of Northumberland, and revised " sailing 
and fighting instructions," as well as a code of discipline, were 
issued. During the latter years of the reign of Charles II. the 
administrative corruption of the time affected the navy severely. 
The fixed charge for ordinary and extraordinary expenses which 
had risen to £300,000 a year was mostly wasted, under the lax 
or dishonest supervision of the commission appointed by the 
king after his brother left office. James II. (1685-1688), who 
kept the admiralship in his own hands and governed largely 
through his able secretary, the diarist Samuel Pepys, did much 
to restore its efficiency. The navy he left was estimated to 
consist of 173 ships of 101,892 tons carrying when in commission 
42,003 men and armed with 6930 guns. 

The evolution of the navy was completed by the Revolution 
of 1688. It now, though still called royal, became a purely 
national force, supported by the yearly votes of parliament, 
and governed by parliamentary committees, known as the com- 
mission for discharging the office of lord high admiral. A lord 
high admiral has occasionally been appointed, as in the case 
of Prince George of Denmark, husband of Queen Anne, or the 
duke of Clarence, afterwards King William IV. But these were 
formal restorations. As no organic change was made till 1832, 
it will now be enough to describe the organization as it was 
during this century and a half. 

The discipline of the navy was based on the Navy Discipline 
Act of 1660 (13th of Charles II.). The act was found to require 
amending acts, and the whole of them were combined, and 
revised by the 22nd of George II., passed in 1749. Some scandals 
of the previous years had caused great popular anger, and the 
alternative to death was taken from the punishment threatened 
against officers who failed to show sufficient zeal in the presence 
of the enemy. It was under this severe code that Admiral Byng 
was executed. In 1780 an amending act was passed which 
allowed a court martial to assign a lighter penalty. 

The government, political and military, was in the hands of the 
admiralty. The administration was carried on in subordination 
to the admiralty by the navy board and the other civil depart- 
ments, the victualling board, the board of transport, the pay 
office, the sick and hurt office and some others. At the head 
were the flag-officers, who were divided as follows: — 



Admiral of the Fleet. 
White. 
Blue. 



Vice-Admiral Red. I 
White, 
tt ., Blue. I 



Rear-Admiral Red. 
„ White. 
Blue. 



The Red, White and Blue squadrons had been the divisions of the 
great fleets of the 17th century, but they became formal terms 



indicating only the seniority of the flag-officers. It was the 
intention of parliament to confine the flag list to these nine 
officers, but as the navy grew this was found to be impossible. 
The rank of admiral of the fleet remained a solitary distinction. 
The captains, commanders and lieutenants were the com- 
missioned officers and received their commissions from the 
admiralty. Promotion from them to flag rank was not at first 
limited by strict rules, but it tended to be by seniority. During 
the war of the Austrian Succession, in 1747, a regular system 
was introduced by which when a captain was promoted for 
active service — to hoist his flag, as the phrase went — he was made 
rear-admiral of the Blue squadron. Captains senior to him 
were promoted rear-admiral in general terms, and were placed on 
the retired list. They were familiarly called " yellow " admirals, 
and to be promoted in this way was to be " yellowed." Pro- 
motion to a lieutenant's commission could be obtained by any one 
who had served, or whose name had been on the books of a sea- 
going ship, for five years. Whether he entered with a king's letter 
of service or from the naval academy at Portsmouth, as a sailor 
or as a ship's boy, he was equally qualified to hold a commission 
if he had fulfilled the necessary conditions and could pass an 
examining board of captains, a test which in the case of lads who 
had interest was generally a pure formality. He was supposed 
to show that he knew some navigation, and was a practical sea- 
man who could hand, reef and steer. As captains were allowed 
a retinue of servants, a custom arose by which they put the 
names of absent or imaginary lads on the books as servants 
and drew the pay allowance for them. It was quite illegal, 
and constituted the offence known as " false musters," punish- 
able by dismissal from the service. But this regulation was even 
less punctually observed than the rule which forbade the carry- 
ing of women. Till the beginning of the 19th century many 
distinguished officers were borne on a ship's books for two or 
three years before they went to sea. The navigation was en- 
trusted to the sailing-master and his mates. He had often been 
a merchant captain or sailor. The captains and lieutenants 
were supposed to understand navigation, but it was notorious 
that many of them had forgotten the little they had learnt in 
order to pass their qualifying examination. As the navy was 
cut down to the quick in peace, the supply of officers was in- 
sufficient at the beginning of a war, and it was found necessary 
to give commissions to men who were illiterate but were good 
practical seamen. Officers who had not begun as gentlemen 
" on the quarter deck " were said to have come in " through 
the hawse hole " — the hole by which the cable runs out at the 
bow. Some among them rose to distinction. The accountant's 
work was done by' the purser, who in bad times was said to be 
often in league with the captain to defraud both the government 
and the crew. The medical service in the navy during the 
1 8th century was bad. The position of the surgeons who were 
appointed by the navy office was not an enviable one, and the 
medical staff of the navy was much recruited from licentiates 
of Edinburgh, or Apothecaries Hall. Finally it is to be observed 
that when a ship was paid off only the commissioned officers, 
masters and surgeons were entitled to half-pay, or had any 
further necessary connexion with the navy. 

The crews were formed partly by free enlistment and partly 
by impressment. When these resources failed, prisoners, 
criminal and political, were allowed to volunteer or were drafted 
from the jails. The Patriotic Society, formed at the beginning 
of the Seven Years' War, educated boys for the navy. During 
the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars the counties were called 
upon to supply quotas, which they commonly secured from the 
debtors' prison or the workhouse. A ship was supposed to 
be well manned when she had one-fifth of her crew of marines, 
and one-third of men bred to the sea. This proportion of seamen 
was rarely reached. As the navy did not train its men from 
boyhood in peace, the genuine sailors, known as " prime seamen " 
and " sailormen," who were the skilled artificers of the time, 
had to be sought for among those who had served their apprentice- 
ship in the merchant service. They never enlisted voluntarily, 
for they disliked the discipline of the navy, and the pay was 



FRENCH1 



NAVY AND NAVIES 



305 



both bad and given in an oppressive way. The pay of a seaman 
was 22s. 6d. a month for able seamen, the rate fixed in the reign 
of Charles II., and 19s. for ordinary seamen. This sum was not 
paid at fixed dates, but at first only at the end of a commission, 
and after 1758 whenever a ship which had been a year in com- 
mission returned home — up to six months before the date of her 
arrival, the balance being kept as a security against desertion, 
which was then incessant and enormous. As men were often 
turned over from ship to ship they had a sheaf of pay notes to 
present on reaching home. The task of making up accounts 
was slow, and the men were often driven to sell their pay notes 
to low class speculators at a heavy discount. Discipline was 
mainly enforced by the lash, and the abuse of their power by 
captains was often gross. 

These grievances led to a long series of single ship mutinies, 
which culminated in the great mutiny of 1797. The fleets at 
Spithead, the Nore, Plymouth, the South of Ireland and Cape of 
Good Hope mutinied one after another. The government had 
aggravated the danger by drafting numbers of the United 
Irish into the fleet, and the quotas from the counties contained 
many dangerous characters. The crisis which seemed to threaten 
the country with ruin passed away. Concessions were made 
to the just claims of the men. When political agitators en- 
deavoured to make use of the discontent of the sailors for treason- 
able ends, the government stood firm, and the patriotism of the 
great bulk of the men enabled it to restore discipline. The 
I breeze at Spithead," as the mutiny was nicknamed in the navy, 
was the beginning of the reforms which made the service as 
popular as it was once hateful. 

The administration of the navy throughout the 18th century, 
and in a less degree after 1806 up to 1832, was in many respects 
slovenly, and was generally corrupt. The different hranches, 
military and civil, were scattered and worked in practical 
independence, though the hoard of admiralty was supposed to 
have absolute authority over all. The admiralty was at White- 
hall, the navy office in Seething Lane near the Tower, and after 
1780 at Somerset House. The victualling office was on Tower 
Hill, the pay office in Broad Street, where also was the Sick and 
Hurt office. In 1749, when the state of the navy excited just 
discontent, the admiralty first established regular visitations 
of the dockyards which in a time of general laxity had become 
nests of corruption. These visitations were, however, not 
regularly made. By the end of the century, and in spite of 
sporadic efforts at reform, the evil had become so generally 
recognized that Earl St Vincent, then first lord, persuaded 
parliament in 1802 to appoint a parliamentary commission of 
inquiry. Its reports, thirteen in number, were given between 
1804 and 1806. They revealed much waste, bad management 
and corruption. The tenth report showed that money voted 
for the navy was used by the then treasurer, Henry Dundas 
(Lord Melville), for purposes which he refused to reveal. In 
1806 another commission was appointed to revise and digest the 
civil affairs of the navy, and a considerable improvement was 
effected. Much remained to be done. There was no strict 
appropriation of money. Accounts were kept in complicated, 
old-fashioned ways which made it impossible to strike a balance. 

In 1832 Sir James Graham, first lord in Earl Grey's adminis- 
tration, obtained the support of parliament for his policy of 
sweeping away the double administration of the navy, by 
admiralty and navy office, and combining them into one divided 
into five departments. With this great organic change the navy 
entered on its modern stage. 

Subject to the warning that for the reason given above, the figures 
do not deserve absolute confidence, the material strength of the 
British navy from the death of Queen Anne to the fall of Napoleon 
was : Ships. Tons.

The^ figures for 1783, and for 1816, are swollen by prizes and worn 
out ships. All the figures include vessels unfit for service, or useful 



only for harbour work, or ordered to be built, but not actually in 
existence. The number of men varied enormously from a peace to 
war establishment. Thus in 1755 on the eve of the Seven Years* 
War parliament voted 12,000 seamen. In 1762 the vote was for 
70,000 men, including 19,061 marines — the corps having been created 
in the interval. In 1775, on the eve of the American War of Inde- 
pendence, the vote was for 18,000 men for the sea service, including 
4354 marines. At the close of the war in 1 783 the vote was for 1 10,000 
men, including 25,291 marines, from which it fell in 1784 to 26,000 
(marines 4495 included) and in 1786 to 18,000 men, of whom 3860 
were marines. In 18 12, when the navy was at the highest level of 
strength it reached, the vote was for 113,000 seamen and 31,400 
marines. From this level it fell in 1816 to 24,000 seamen and 9000 
marines. These figures represent paper strength. ^ Owing to the 
prevalence of desertion, and the difficulty of obtaining men, the 
actual strength was always appreciably lower. 

The French Navy. 

Before the French monarchy could possess a fleet, its early kings, 
whose rule was effective only in the centre of the country, had 
first to conquer their sea coast from their great vassals. Philip 
Augustus (1 180-1223) began by expelling King John of England 
from Normandy and Poitou. The process was not completed 
until Louis XII. (1498-1515) united the duchy of Brittany to the 
crown by his marriage with the duchess Anne. Long before the 
centralization of authority had been completed the French kings 
possessed a fleet, or rather two fleets of very distinct character. 
Her geographical position has always compelled France to draw 
her navy from two widely different sources — from the Channel 
and the coast of the Atlantic on the north and west and on 
the south from the Mediterranean. This separation has imposed 
on her the difficult task of concentrating her forces at times of 
crisis, and the concentration has always been hazardous. Like 
their English rivals, the French kings of the middle ages drew 
their naval forces from the feudal array, the national levy and 
their own ships. But the proportion of the elements was not the 
same. Many of the great vassals owed the service of ships, and 
their obedience was always less certain than that of the Cinque 
Ports. The trading towns were less able, and commonly less 
willing, than the English to supply the king with ships. He was 
thus driven to trust mainly to his own vessels — and they were 
drawn at first exclusively, and always to a great extent, from the 
Mediterranean seaboard. His own territories in the south were 
insufficiently provided with seamen, and the French king had 
therefore to seek his captains, his men and his vessels by purchase 
or by subsidies from Genoa, or in a less degree from Aragon. 
When Saint Louis (1 226-1 270) sailed on his first crusade in 1249, 
he formed the first French royal fleet, and created the first French 
dockyard at Aigues Mortes. Ships and dockyard were bought 
from, or were built by, the Genoese at the king's expense. His 
admirals, the first appointed by the French crown, Ugo Lercari 
and Jacobo di Levante, were Genoese. Saint Louis created the 
office of admiral of France. When in later times Aigues Mortes 
was cut off from the sea by the encroachment of the land, 
Narbonne and Marseilles were used as ports of war. This fleet 
was purely Mediterranean in character. It consisted of galleys, 
and though the sail was used it was dependent on the oar, and 
therefore on the " turma " (ckiourme) of rowers, who in earlier 
times were hired men, but from the middle of the 15th century 
began to be composed of galley slaves — prisoners of war, slaves 
purchased in Africa, criminals and vagabonds condemned by the 
magistrate to the chain and the oar. Philip IV. le Bel (1285- 
13 14) was led by his rivalry with Edward I. of England to create 
a naval establishment on the Channel. He found his materials 
in the existing Mediterranean fleet. A dockyard was built for 
him at Rouen, again by the Genoese Enrico Marchese, Lanfranc 
Tartaro and Albertino Spinola. It was officially known as the 
Tersenal or Dorsenal, but was commonly called the clos des gallies 
or galley yard, and it existed from 1294 to 1419. The French 
navy has always suffered from alternations of attention and 
neglect. In times of disastrous wars on land it has fallen into 
confusion and obscurity. Except when Francis I. (1515-1547) 
made a vigorous attempt to revive it at the very close of his. 
reign, the French navy languished till the 1 7th century. Its very 
unity of administration disappeared in the 15th century, when

NAVY AND NAVIES 



[SPANISH 



the jurisdiction of the admiral of France was invaded and defied 
by the admiralties of Guyenne, Brittany and the Levant. These 
local admiralties were suppressed by Francis I. 

Richelieu, the great minister of Louis XIII., found the navy 
extinct. He was reduced to seeking the help of English ships 
against the Huguenots. From him dates the creation of the 
modern French navy. In 1626 he abolished the office of admiral 
of France, which had long been no more than a lucrative place held 
by a noble who was too great a man to obey orders. He himself 
assumed the title of grand maitre et surirttendant de la navigation, 
and the military command was entrusted to the* admirals du 
Ponant, i.e. of the west or Atlantic and Channel, and du Levant, 
i. e. of the Mediterranean. But Richelieu's establishment 
shrivelled after his death. It was raised from its ruins by the 
pride and policy of Louis XIV. (1643-1715). Under his direc- 
tion a numerous and strongly organized navy was created. A 
very full code of laws — the ordonnance — was framed by Colbert 
and Lyonne with the advice of the ablest officers, and was 
promulgated on the 5th of April 1689. Though modified by other 
ordonnances in 1765, 1772, 1774, 1776 and 17S6, in the main lines 
it governed the French navy till the Revolution. 

By this code the French navy was based on the Inscription 
maritime, a very severe law of compulsory service, affecting the 
inhabitants of the coast and of the valleys of rivers as far up as 
they were capable of floating a lighter. The whole body of 
officials and officers was divided into the civil branch known as 
la plume, and the military branch called Vepie. The first had 
the entire control of the finances, and the dockyards of Toulon, 
Brest and Rochfort, with an intendant de la marine at the head 
of each. The general chief was the sous secretaire au departement 
de la marine, the title of the French minister of marine till the 
Revolution. Under Louis XIV. a civil officer, the intendant des 
armies navales, who ranked as an admiral, sat on councils of war 
and reported on the conduct of the naval officers. He must not 
be confused with the intendant de la marine. The military branch 
had at its head the admiral of France, the office having been 
re-created in 1669 by Louis XIV. in favour of his natural son the 
due de Vermandois. In theory the admiral was the administra- 
tive military and judicial head of the admiralty. In practice 
the admirals were princes of the blood, who drew pay and fees, 
but who never went to sea, with the one exception of the count 
of Toulouse, another natural son of Louis XIV. Two vice- 
admirals of France du Ponant and du Levant commanded in the 
Mediterranean and on the ocean. A third office of vice-admiral 
of France was created for Suffren, The lieutenant giniral (vice- 
admiral) came next, and below him4he chef d'escadre (rear- 
admiral), capitaine de vaisseau (post captain), capitaine de br&lol 
(fircship) or de frigate (commander), and the major, a chief of the 
staff on beard who commanded all landing parties. There was 
no permanent body of marines in the French navy, the infanterie 
de la marine being troops for service in the colonies, which were 
administratively connected with the navy and governed by 
naval officers. The lieutenant needs no explanation, and the 
enseigne was a sub-lieutenant. The corps of officers was recruited 
from les gardes de la marine, answering more or less to the English 
midshipmen — who received a careful professional education and 
were required to be of noble birth. Besides the grand corps 
de la marine there was a fleet of galleys with a general at its head, 
and a staff of officers also of noble birth. It was suppressed in 
1748 as being a useless expense. Officers not belonging to the 
grand corps were sometimes taken in from the merchant service. 
They were known as officiers bleus, because their uniform was 
all blue, and not, as in the case of the noble corps, blue and red. 
On paper the organization of the French royal navy was very 
thorough. In reality it worked ill; the severity of the inscription 
maritime made it odious, and owing to the prevailing financial 
embarrassment of the crown after 1692 the sailors were ill-paid, 
ill-fed and defrauded of the pensions promised them. They fled 
abroad, or went inland and took up other trades. The military 
and civil branches were always in a state of hostility to one 
another, and their pay also was commonly in arrears. The noble 
corps was tenacious of its privileges, and extremely insolent 



towards the officiers bleus. By Louis XV. (1715-1774) the navy 
was neglected till the last years of his reign, when it was revived 
by the due de Choiseul. Under Louis XVI. (1774-1792) when 
the Revolution broke out the long accumulated hatred felt for 
the noble officers had free play. Louis XVI. had indeed relaxed 
the rule imposing the presentation of proofs of nobility on all 
naval officers, but the change was made only in 1786 and it came 
too late. The majority of the noble officers were massacred by 
the Jacobins or driven into exile. 

The Revolution subjected the French navy to a series of. 
disorganizations and reorganizations by which all tradition and 
discipline were destroyed. Old privileges and the office of Grand 
Admiral were suppressed. The attempt to revive the navy in 
the face of the superior power of England was hopeless. Neither 
the Republic nor the Empire was able to create an effective navy. 
They had no opportunity to form a new body of officers out of 
the lads they educated. 

m The strength of the French Royal Navy is difficult to estimate, 
since for long periods of the 18th century it was rotting in harbour 
and its ships were rarely commissioned. Louis XIV. is credited with 
95 ships of the line and 29 frigates, together with many smaller 
vessels, in 1692. At the close of the Seven Years' War it had sunk 
to 44 ships of the line and 9 frigates. By 1778 the French navy 
had risen to 78 of the line with frigates and femallcr vessels which 
brought the total to 264. In 1793 on the outbreak of the revolution- 
ary war, it was estimated to consist of 82 ships of the line, mostly 
fine vessels, and of frigates with lesser craft which brought it to a 
total of 250. Under Napoleon the mere number was very much 
more considerable and included ships built in the annexed territories, 
but they were largely constructed of green timber, were meant 
merely to force England to maintain blockades, and were never sent 
to sea. 

Spanish Navy. 

The administrative history of the Spanish navy is singularly 
confused and broken. It might almost be said that the country 
had no navy in the full sense of the word — that is to say, no 
organized maritime force provided and governed by the state 
for warlike purposes only — until one was created on the French 
model by the sovereigns of the Bourbon dynasty i.e. after 1700. 
Yet the kings of the Spanish peninsula, whether they wore the 
crown of Castile and Leon or of Aragon, had fleets, formed, like 
all the others of the middle ages, partly of ships supplied by the 
coast towns and populations, partly of the royal vessels. Aragon 
was a purely Mediterranean power. Its fleets, which were chiefly 
supported by Barcelona, a flourishing commercial city, were 
composed of galleys. With the union of the crown in 1479 
Aragon fell into the background, and its navy continued to be 
represented only by a few galleys, for service in the Mediterranean 
against the pirates. The dominions of Castile stretched from 
the Bay of Biscay to the Mediterranean. Its kings, therefore, 
had need both of ships (naos) and galleys. The first beginnings 
of the Castilian navy were not due to the king, but to the foresight 
and enterprise of Diego Gelmirez, bishop and afterwards first 
archbishop of Santiago in Gallicia. In or about 1 1 20 he employed 
the Genoese Ogerio to form a dockyard at Iria, and to build 
vessels. The naval activity of the coast of the Bay of Biscay 
developed so rapidly that in 1 147 a squadron from the northern 
ports took part in the conquest of Almeria by Alfonso VII. 
(11 20-1 1 57) in alliance with the Pisans. A century later (1248) 
another squadron constructed at the expense of the king 
Fernando III. El Santo (1217-1252), and commanded by Count 
Ramon Bonifaz of Burgos, the first admiral of Castile, took a 
decisive part in the conquest of Seville. The annexation of Anda- 
lucia and the necessity for guarding against invasions from Africa 
called for a great extension of the navy of Castile. Alfonso X. 
El Sabio (1 252-1 284) founded the great galley dockyards of 
Seville — the arenal. It was also the work of Genoese builders 
and administrators. In the course of the 13th century the 
towns of the northern coast formed one of the associations so 
common in Spanish history, and known as hermandades (brother- 
hoods). The first meeting of its delegates took place at 
Castrourdiales near Bilbao in 1 296, when the towns of Santander, 
Laredo, Bermeo, Guetaria, San Sebastian and Vitoria were 
represented. The hermandad de la marisma (of the seafarers)

NAVY AND NAVIES 



307 






of Castile supplied the squadrons which took an active part 
in the wars of the 14th and 15th centuries between France and 
England as allies of the French. Its history is obscure, and 
it came to an end with the establishment of the full authority 
of the crown by the Catholic sovereigns Ferdinand and Isabel. 

The discovery of America, the acquisition by marriage or 
conquest of Sicily, Naples and Flanders, gave the kings of 
Spain a yet stronger motive for maintaining a powerful navy. 
The maxim that their ships were the bridges which joined their 
widely scattered dominions was fully accepted by them and 
their servants. But neither the Catholic sovereigns nor the 
Habsburgs who held the throne till 1700, made any attempt 
to organize a common navy. The sources from which the naval 
armaments of Spain were drawn during the greatness and 
decline of the country were these. Galleys were maintained 
in the Mediterranean, but they were mainly found by Sicily 
and Naples, or by the contracts which the kings of Spain made 
with the Genoese house of Doria. On the ocean the chief object 
of the Spanish government was to conduct and protect the severely 
regulated trade with America. Thus it was mainly concerned 
for long to obtain the lumbering and roomy vessels called 
"galleons," first designed by Alvaro de Bazan, marquess of 
Santa Cruz, which were rather armed traders than real warships. 
The crown did not build its own ships, but contracted for 
them with its admirals. The American convoys sailed from and 
returned to the Bay of Cadiz. One squadron, the flota, 
carried the trade, was navigated by the admiral, with whom was 
associated a general, who commanded the few warships proper, 
and was answerable for the protection of the whole. Another 
squadron, called of Cantabria, was maintained on the north 
coast, and was employed to see the convoy on its way and meet 
it on its return home. It had its own admiral and general,,. 
The ships were always treated as if they were transports for 
carrying soldiers. The seamen element was neglected. The 
command was divided between the capitan de mar (sea captain) 
who was responsible for the navigation and the capitan de guerra 
(soldier captain) who fought the ship. The same division went 
through all ranks. The soldiers would neither help to work 
the ship nor fight the guns. They used musketry only, or 
relied on a chance to board with sword and pike. Properly 
speaking there was no class of naval officers, and the overworked 
and depressed seamen could not supply good gunners. No 
general naval administration existed. The office of admiral 
of Castile became purely ornamental and hereditary in the 
family of Henriquez. It was not replaced by a navy office. 
One of the innumerable juntas or boards, through which the 
Spanish kings governed, looked after the making of contracts, 
and co-operated with the council of the Indes which was specially 
concerned with the American convoys. After the disasters 
of the later years of Philip II. (see Armada) some efforts at 
improvement were made. Better ships were built, and something 
was done to raise the condition of the seamen. But no thorough- 
going organization was ever created, and in the utter decadence 
of the 17th century the Spanish navy and seafaring population 
alike practically disappeared. 

Under the Bourbon dynasty which attained the throne in 
1700 the Spanish navy was revived, or rather a navy was created 
on the French model. Don Jose Patino, a very able man, was 
named intendente de la marina in 171 5, and in 1717 he drew up 
a draft naval organization and code, founded on the French 
ordonnance of 1689. Patino J s draft was the basis of the 
ordenanzas generates (general code) issued in 1 748. The Spaniards 
even set up a squadron of galleys with a separate staff of officers, 
also on the French model, which was, however, suppressed in 
the year of the issue of the ordenanzas generates. Fine arsenals 
were organized at Ferrol and Carthagena. The navy thus 
created produced some distinguished officers, and fought some 
brilliant single ship actions. But the embarrassments of the 
treasury, the tendency of several of the kings to sacrifice their 
navy to political schemes requiring mainly the employment 
of troops and the ruin of the seafaring population during the 
17th century, prevented it from ever attaining to a high level 






of efficiency. During the Peninsular War the new navy all 
but disappeared as the old had done. The want of pecuniary 
resources and internal instability have prevented its revival 
on any considerable scale. 

The navy created by Patino consisted in 1737 of 56 ships in all, of 
which 28 were of the line, of from 50 to 80 guns, with one of 114 

funs. In 1746 the number of ships of the line had increased to 37. 
n 1759 the list of line of battle ships was 50— of which the majority, 
if not all, had been constructed by English shipbuilders, in the service 
pf the Spanish government. In 1778, when at the height of its power, 
it contained 62 ships of the line. 

Dutch Navy. 

The Dutch fleet arose out of the great struggle with Spain in 
the 1 6th century. The Netherlanders had been a maritime 
people from the earliest antiquity. Under their medieval 
rulers, the counts of Holland and of Flanders and the House of 
Burgundy, they had rendered service at sea. The freemen 
owed the service known as the riemtal (riem, an oar). An 
admiralty office was established in 1397. But during the revolt 
against Philip II. of Spain, new naval forces were formed which 
had no connexion with the medieval navy, save in so far as the 
governments established in the different states which afterwards 
formed the Seven Provinces took possession of the jurisdiction 
and the dues of the medieval admiralty. The naval part of 
the war with Spain was for long conducted by the adventurers 
known as the " beggars of the sea," and was mainly confined 
to the coasts and rivers. In 1597, when the Confederation was 
formed and had provided itself with a common government 
in the states-general, the need for a regularly organized sea- 
going fleet was felt. In that year the banner of the states- 
general, the red lion with the arrows in its paw, was first hoisted 
during the expedition to Cadiz in alliance with England. On 
the 13th of August 1597 the states-general issued the decree 
(Instructie) which regulated the naval administration of the 
Republic until 1795. The attachment of the Netherlanders 
to their local franchises was too strong to permit of trie establish- 
ment of a central authority with absolute powers. It was 
therefore necessary to make a compromise by which some 
measure of unity was secured while the freedom of the various 
confederate states was effectually guarded. Five boards of 
admiralty (Admiraliteits collegien) were recognized. They were: 
South Holland, or the Maas, sitting at Rotterdam; North 
Holland, or Amsterdam; Westfriesland (the western side of 
the Zuyder Zee), at Hoorn or Enkhuizen on alternate years; 
Zealand at Middleburg; and Friesland at Dokhum, or after 
1645 at Harlingen. These-bodies enjoyed all the rights of the 
admiralty and collected the port dues, out of which they provided 
for the current expenses of their respective squadrons. Extra- 
ordinary charges for war were met by grants from the province 
to which each board belonged. Some measure of unity was 
secured among these five independent authorities by three 
devices. Each board consisted of seven persons, of whom four 
were named by the province and required confirmation by the 
states-general, while three were chosen from other provinces 
to secure a representation of the common wealt h J The members 
of the boards took an oath of fealty to the states-general. The 
stadtholdcr was admiral-general. He presided at the board, 
and commanded the squadron. In his absence his place was 
taken by his lieutenant admiral -general. An oath of fealty 
was also taken to him, and all armed ships whether men-of-war 
or privateers sailed with his commission. He chose the captains 
from two candidates presented to him by the board. Delegates 
from the boards met twice a year to consult on the general 
interest. When the stadtholdership was suspended in 1650 
the powers of the admiral-general were absorbed by their high 
mightinesses (Hunne Hogen Mogen) of the states-general. 
The staff of officers began with the lieutenant admiral-general 
and descended through the vice-admiral, the quaintly named 
Sckout-Mj-nacktj who was and is the rear-admiral, and whose 
title means " commander by night." These flag officers were 
named by the admiral-general or states-general. The captain 
(ZeecapitUn) was selected from the provincial list. The lieutenants

NAVY AND NAVIES 



[UNITED STATES 



were appointed by the local boards. No regular method of 
recruiting the corps of officers existed. 

This compromise was in itself a bad system. With the 
exception of the board of North Holland, which was supported 
by the wealth of Amsterdam, the admiralties were commonly 
distressed for money. Unity of action was difficult to obtain. 
Much of the work of convoy which the state squadrons should 
have performed was thrown in the 17th century on directorates 
(Directien) of merchants who fitted out privateers at their own 
expense. When there was no stadtholder, the local governing 
bodies trenched on the authority of the states-general, and 
indulged in a great deal of favouritism. In one respect the navy 
of the Dutch republic might have been taken as a model by its 
neighbours. The feeding of the crews was contracted for by the 
captains, who were required to enter into securities for the 
execution of the contract, and who had a reputation for probity. 
The Dutch crews, being better fed and looked after than the 
English, suffered less from disease. The clumsy organization 
of the Dutch navy put it at a disadvantage in its wars with 
England, but the seamanship of the crews, their good gunnery, 
and the great ability of many of their admirals made them at 
all times formidable enemies. No organic change was made 
till 1795, when the victories of the French revolutionary armies 
led to the formation of the Batavian republic. The five 
admiralties were then swept away and replaced by a committee 
for the direction of naval affairs, with a unified administration, 
organized by Pieter Paulus, a former official of the board of the 
Maas. As Holland was now swept into the general convulsion 
of the French Revolution, it followed the fortunes of France. 
Its navy, after belonging to the Batavian republic, passed to 
the ephemeral kingdom of Holland, created by Napoleon in 
favour of his brother Louis in 1806 and annexed to France in 
1 810. The Dutch navy then became absorbed in the French. 
After the fall of Napoleon a navy was created for the kingdom 
of the Netherlands out of the Dutch fragments of the Imperial 
force. 

- The United States. 

The American navy came into existence shortly after the 
Declaration of Independence. As early as October 1775 Congress 
authorized the construction of two national cruisers, and, at the 
same time, appointed a marine committee to administer naval 
affairs. The first force, consisting of purchased vessels, badly 
fitted and built, and insufficiently equipped and manned, 
embraced two ships of 24 guns each, six brigs carrying from 
10 to 12 guns, two schooners each with 8 guns, and four sloops, 
three of 10 guns and one of 4 guns. On December 22nd a 
personnel of officers was selected, one of the lieutenants being 
the well-known Paul Jones. Esek Hopkins was made com- 
mander-in-chief, but, having incurred the censure of Congress, 
he was dismissed early in 1777, and since then the title has never 
been revived except in the person of the president. In November 
1776 the grades of admiral, vice-admiral, rear-admiral and 
commodore were assimilated in rank and precedence to relative 
army titles, but they were never created by law until 1862. 
During the war a number of spirited engagements occurred, 
but there was a great lack of efficient material at home, and 
agents. abroad were not able to enlist the active sympathies 
of nations or rulers. Benjamin Franklin did manage to equip 
one good squadron, but this was rendered almost useless by 
internal dissensions, and it required the victory of Paul Jones 
in the " Bon Homme Richard " over the " Serapis " to bring 
about any tangible result for the risk taken. During the war 
800 vessels of all classes were made prizes, but the navy lost 
by capture n vessels of war and a little squadron of gunboats 
on the lakes; and, with 13 ships destroyed to avoid capture 
by the British, 5 condemned, and 3 wrecked at sea, the country 
was practically without a naval force between 1780 and 1785. 

Owing to the depredations upon commerce of the Barbary 
powers, Congress in 1794 ordered the construction of six frigates, 
prescribing that four of them should be armed with 44 guns 
and two with 36 guns; but, the Berbers having made peace, 



the number of vessels was reduced one-half, and no additious 
were made until 1797, when the " Constitution," " United 
States " and " Constellation " were built. The navy was at 
first placed under the war department, but a navy department 
with a secretary of its own was created in 1798. From 181 5 
to 1842 the secretary was aided by a board of commissioners 
chosen from among the naval officers, but in the latter year the 
department was reorganized into five bureaus, which were 
increased to eight in 1862. Each has a naval officer at its head. 
They deal with navigation, ordnance, equipment, navy yards, 
medicines, provisions, steam engineering and construction. 
The excellent naval academy at Annapolis was founded in 1845 
by the then secretary of the navy, G. Bancroft. The war college 
for officers at -Coasters Harbor, Newport, R.I., dates from 1884. 

The Balance oj Navies in History. 

The five navies above discussed claim special notice on various 
grounds: the British, Dutch and French because they have 
been leaders and models; the Spanish because it has been 
closely associated with the others; the American because it 
was the first of the extra-European sea forces. But these great 
examples by no means exhaust the list of navies, old and new, 
which have played or now play a part. Every state which has - 
a coast has also desired to possess forces on the sea. Even the 
papacy maintained a fighting force of galleys which took part 
in the naval transactions of the Mediterranean for centuries. 
The Turkish sultans have fitted out fleets which once were a ■ 
menace to southern Europe. But in a survey of general naval 
history it is not necessary to give all these navies special mention, 
even though some of them have a certain intrinsic interest. 
Some, the Scandinavian navies for instance, have been confined 
to narrow limits, and have had no influence either by their 
organization, nor, save locally, by action. Others again have 
been the purely artificial creation of governments. Instances of 
these on a small scale are the navies of the grand duchy of 
Tuscany, or of the Bourbon kings of Naples. 

A much greater instance is the navy of Russia. Founded by 
Peter the Great (1680-17 2 5), it has been mainly organized and 
has been most successfully led by foreigners. When „ . 
the Russian government has desired for political 
reasons to make a show of naval strength, it has been numerous. 
In 1770, during the reign of Catherine II. (1762-1796), a Russian 
fleet, nominally commanded by the empress's favourite Orloff, 
but in reality directed by two former officers of the British 
navy, John Elphinston (1722-1785) and Samuel Greig (1735- 
1788), gained some successes against the Turks in the Levant. 
But when opposed to formidable enemies, as in the Crimean 
War, it has either remained in port, or. has, as in the case of the 
war with Japan (1904-1905), proved that its vitality was not 
in proportion to its size. 

The innumerable navies of South American repubh'cs are 
small copies of older forces. 

The 19th century did indeed see the rise of three navies, which 
are of a very different character — the Italian, which was the result 
of the unification of Italy, the German, which followed /M/ 
the creation of the German Empire, and the Japanese. Germany, 
But all three are contemporary in their origin, and Japan, \ 
have inevitably been modelled on older forces — the Au9tri ** 
British and the French. With them must go the Austrian navy, 
excellent but unavoidably small. 

If we look set the relations which the navies of the modern 
world have had to one another, it will be seen that the great 
discoveries of the later 15th century shifted the seat 
of naval power to the ocean for two reasons. In the ^f™*** 
first place they imposed on all who wished to sail the power. 
wider seas opened to European enterprise by Vasco 
de Gama and Columbus the obligation to use a vessel which 
could carry water and provisions sufficient for a large crew during 
a long voyage. The Mediterranean states and their seamen 
were not prepared by resources or habit to meet the call. But 
there was a second and equally effective reason. The powers 
which had -an Atlantic coast were incomparably better placed

than the Italian states, or the cities of the Baltic, tc take 
advantage of the maritime discoveries of the great epoch which 
stretches from 1402 to 1 526. In the natural course the leadership 
fell to Portugal and Spain. Both owed much to Italian science 
and capital, but the profit fell inevitably to them. The reasons 
why Spain failed to found a permanent naval power have been 
given, and they apply equally to Portugal. Neither achieved 
the formation of a solid navy. The claim of both to retain a 
monopoly of the right to settle in, or trade with, the New World 
and Asia was in due course contested by neighbouring nations. 
France was torn by internal dissensions (the Wars of Religion and 
the Fronde) and could not compete except through a few private 
adventurers. England and Holland were able to prove the 
essential weakness of the Spaniards at sea before the end of the 
1 6th century. In the 17th century the late allies against Spain 
now fought against one another. Her insular position, her 
security against having to bear the immense burden of a war 
on a land frontier, and the superiority of her naval organization 
over the divided administration of Holland, gave the victory to 
Great Britain. She was materially helped by the fact that the 
French monarch attacked Holland on land, and exhausted its 
resources. Great Britain and France now became the com- 
petitors for superiority at sea, and so remained from 1689 till 
the fall of Napoleon in 181 5. 

During this period of a century and a quarter Great Britain 
had again the most material advantage : that her enemy was not 
only contending with her at sea, but was engaged in endeavouring 
to establish and maintain a military preponderance over her 
neighbours on the continent of Europe. Hence the necessity for 
her to support great and costly armies, which led to the sacrifice 
of her fleet, and drove Holland into alliance with Great Britain 
(Wars of the League of Augsburg, of the Spanish Succession, 
of the Austrian Succession and the Seven Years' War). During 
the War of American Independence France was in alliance with 
Spain and Holland, and at peace on land. She and her allies 
were able to impose terms of peace by which Great Britain 
surrendered positions gained in former wars. But the strength 
of the British navy was not broken, and in quality it was shown 
to be essentially superior. 

The French Revolution undid all that the government of 
France had gained between 1778 and 1783 by attention to its 
navy and abstinence from wars on land. The result of the 
upheaval in France was to launch her into schemes of universal 
conquest. Other nations were driven to fight for existence with 
the help of Great Britain. In that long struggle all the navies 
of Europe disappeared except the French, which was broken 
by defeat and rendered inept by inaction, and the victorious 
British navy. When Napoleon fell, the navy of Great Britain 
was not merely the first in the world; it was the only powerful 
navy in existence. 

The pre-eminent position which the disappearance of possible 
rivals had given to Great Britain lasted for several years un- 
challenged. But it was too much the consequence of a com- 
bination of circumstances which could neither recur nor endure. 
The French navy was vigorously revived under the Restoration 
and the government of Louis Philippe (the periods from 18 15 
to 1830 and 1830 to 1848). The emperor Nicholas I. of Russia 

((1825-1855) built ships in considerable numbers. As early as 
1838 the fear that the naval superiority of Great Britain would 
be destroyed had already begun to agitate some observers. 
The " extremely reduced state " of the British navy, and the 
danger that an overwhelming force would be suddenly thrown 
on the English coast, were vehemently set forth by Commander 
W. H. Craufurd, and by an anonymous flag-officer. The peril 
to be feared, it was argued, was an alliance* between France and 
Russia. In 1838 the British navy contained, built and building, 
00 ships of the line, 93 frigates and 1 2 war steamers ; the French, 
49 of the line, 60 frigates and 37 war steamers, including armed 
packets; Russia, 50 of the line, 25 frigates and 8 steamers; the 
United States, 15 of the line, 35 frigates and 16 war steamers. 
The agitation of 1838 passed away, and the Crimean War, 
entailing as it did the destruction of a great part of the Russian 






fleet at Sebastopol, and proving the weakness of the Baltic 
fleet, and having, moreover, been conducted by an alliance of 
France and Great Britain against Russia, would seem to have 
shown that the anxieties of 1838 were exaggerated. But the 
rivalry which is inherent in the very position of states possessing 
sea coasts and maritime interests could not cease. The French 
imperial government was anxious to develop its navy. By the 
construction of the armoured floating batteries employed in 
bombardment of Kinburn in October 1855, and by the launch 
of the first seagoing ironclad " La Gloire " in 1859, it began a 
new race for superiority at* sea, which has shown no sign of 
slackening since. The launch of the " Gloire " was foDowed by 
political events in Europe which brought forward new com- 
petitors, while great navies were developed in America and Asia. 

The year 187 1 was the beginning of a vast growth of naval 
armaments. It saw the completion of the unity of Italy and the 
formation of the German empire, two powers which a . 
could not dispense with strong fleets. But for some modern 
years the Italian and German navies, though already rivalry in 
in existence, were still in a youthful stage. The rapid armam 
growth of the United States navy dates from about ments% 
1890, and the Japanese is a few years younger. France, Russia 
and Great Britain, in answer to them, began the race in which 
the efforts of each had a stimulating effect on the others. Though 
the alliance between France and Russia was not formed till 
later, their common interests had marked them out as allies 
from the first, and it will be no less convenient than accurate to 
treat Great Britain and the partners in the Dual Alliance as for 
some time opposed to one another. 

In the general reorganization of her armaments undertaken 
by France after the war of 1870-71, her navy was not neglected. 
Large schemes of construction were taken in hand. « tan - 
The instability of French ministries, and the differences and the 
of principle which divided the authorities who favoured Oust 
the construction of battleships from those who were Alliance. 
partisans of cruisers and torpedo-vessels, militated against a 
coherent policy. Yet the French navy grew in strength, and 
Russia began to build strong vessels. As early as 1874 the 
approaching launch of a coast-defence ironclad at Kronstadt 
(the " Peter the Great " designed by the English constructor 
Sir E. J. Reed) caused one of the successive " naval scares " 
which recurred frequently in the coming years. It was, however, 
largely fictitious, and passed away without producing much 
effect. In 1878 the prospect of a war arising out of the Russian 
and Turkish conflict of that year, again stirred doubts as to the 
sufficiency of her naval armaments in England. Yet it was not 
till about 1885 that an agitation for the increase of the British 
fleet was begun in a consistent and continuous way. The con- 
troversy of the succeeding years was boundless, and was perhaps 
the more heated because the controversialists were not con- 
trolled by the necessity for using terms of definite meaning, and 
because the lists published for the purpose of making comparisons 
were inevitably of doubtful value; when ships built, building 
and ordered to be built, but not begun, were counted together — 
or as not infrequently happened, were all added on one side, 
but not on the other. The belief that the British navy was not 
so strong as it should be, in view of the dependence of the British 
empire on strength at sea, spread steadily. Measures were first 
taken to improve the opportunities for practice allowed to the 
fleet by the establishment of yearly naval manoeuvres in 1885, 
and the lessons they afforded were utilized to enforce the necessity 
for an increase of the British fleet. In 1888 a committee of three 
admirals (Sir W.Dowell, Sir Vesey Hamilton and Sir R. Richards), 
appointed to report on the manoeuvres of that year, gave it as 
their opinion that " no time should be lost in placing the British 
navy beyond comparison with that of any two powers." This 
verdict met a ready acceptance by the nation, and in 1889 
Lord George Hamilton, then first lord of the admiralty, intro- 
duced the Naval Defence Act, which provided for the addition to 
the navy within four and a half years of 70 vessels of 318,000 tons 
at a cost of £21,500,000. The object was to obviate the risk of 
sudden reductions for reasons of economy in the building vote.

NAVY AND NAVIES 



[BALANCE OF NAVIES 



Later experience proved that the practice of fixing the amount to 
be spent for a period of years operated to restrict the freedom of 
government to make Additions, for which the necessity had not 
been foreseen when the money was voted. But the act of 1889 
did effect an immediate addition to the British fleet, while as was 
inevitable it stimulated other powers to increased efforts. 

The rivalry between Great Britain and the states composing 
the Dual Alliance may be said to have lasted till 1904, when the 
course of the war in the Far East removed Russia from the field. 
It must be borne in mind that during the latter part of these 
twenty years Russia was largely influenced by the desire to arm 
against the growing navy of Japan. Comparisons between the 
additions to the fleets made on cither side, even when supported 
by a great display of figures, are of uncertain value. Number 
is no sufficient test of strength when taken apart from quality, 
distribution, the command of coaling stations — which are of 
extreme value to a modern fleet — and other considerations. 
But the respective lists of battleships supply a rough and ready 
standard, and when taken with the number of men employed 
and the size of the budgets (both subject to qualifications to 
be mentioned) does enable us to see with some approximation to 
accuracy how far the rivals have attained their desired aims. 
In 1889, before the passing of the Naval Defence Act, the British 
navy contained 32 battleships of 262,340 tons. The united 
French and Russian fleets had 22 of 150,653 tons: of these 17 
were French, 7 being vessels of wood plated with iron and 
therefore of no value when exposed to the fire of modern ex- 
plosives. This is but one of many examples which might be 
given of the fallacious character of mere lists of figures. In 1894, 
when the Naval Defence Act had produced its effect, the com- 
parative figures were: for Great Britain, 46 ironclads (or battle- 
ships) of 441,640 tons, and for the Dual Alliance 35 of 270,953 — in 
which, however, the seven wooden vessels were still included. 
France and Russia had then large schemes of new construction — 
60,300 tons of ships over 10,000 tons for France, and 78,000 tons 
for Russia. The British figure was 70,000 tons. But the French 
and Russian list included mere names of vessels, of which the 
plans were not then drafted. 

The rivalry in building went on as eagerly after 1894 as before. 
At the beginning of 1904 Great Britain had 67 battleships of 
^95)370 tons, as against 57 of 635,500 belonging to the powers 
of the Dual Alliance. The difference in favour of Great Britain 
was therefore 10 battleships, and 259,870 tons. Vessels not 
ready for service were included in the list, which therefore in- 
cludes potential as well as actual strength. The balance in favour 
of Great Britain was less in 1904 than it had been in 1885 in mere 
numbers. During this period the naval budget of Great Britain 
had risen from £12,000,000 in 1885 to £34,457,500 in 1 903-1904. 
The number of men employed had grown from 57,000 to 127,000. 
The figures for the Dual Alliance cannot be given with equal 
confidence. France had transferred the troupes de la marine or 
colonial troops from the navy to the army, which introduced 
a confusing element into the comparison, and the figures for 
Russian expenditure are very questionable. The total credit 
demanded for the Frerurh navy in 1890, the year after the passing 
of the British Naval Defence Act, was frs. 217,147,462. By 
1903 the sum had risen to frs. 351,471,524. The Russian figures 
for 1890 are not attainable, but her budget for 1903 was 
£1 1,067,889 sterling. A comparison in numbers of men available 
is wholly misleading, since the British navy contains a large 
number o{ voluntarily enlisted men who serve for many years, 
and a small voluntary reserve, while France and Russia include 
all who are liable to be called out for compulsory service during 
a short period. There is no equality between them and the highly 
trained men of the British navy. The immense increase in its 
staff represents an addition to real power to which there is 
nothing to correspond in the case of continental states. 

While this vast growth of naval power was going on in Great 
Britain, France and Russia, other rivals were entering into the 
lists with various fortunes. Italy may be said to have been the 
first comer. Her national navy, formed out of the existing 
squadrons of Sardinia, Tuscany and Naples, had stood the strain 



of war in 1866" very ill. The conditions in which the unity of 
the country had been achieved during the Franco-Prussian War 
of 1870-71, together with the obvious need for a navy competi- 
in the case of a nation with a very extended sea coast, tJoa / 
animated the Italians to great and even excessive ' new 
efforts. Their policy was controlled by the knowledge navies: 
that they could not hope to rival France in numbers, iUly * 
and they therefore aimed at obtaining individual vessels of a 
high level of strength. Italy may be said to have set the example 
of building monster ships, armed with monster guns. But she 
was unable to maintain her position in the race. The too hopeful 
finance in which she had indulged in the first enthusiasm of 
complete political unification led to serious embarrassment in 
1894. Her naval budget sank from £4,960,000 in 1891 to 
£31776,845 in 1897-1898, and only rose slowly to £5,037,642 in 
1 905-1 906. As a candidate in the race for naval strength she 
necessarily held a subordinate place, though always to be ranked 
among the important sea powers. In 1903, when the rivalry of 
Great Britain and the Dual Alliance was at its height, her 
strength in battleships was 18, of 226,630 tons. In number, 
therefore, they did more than cover the balance in favour of 
Great Britain as against the Dual Alliance, but not in tonnage, 
in which the difference in favour of Great Britain was 259,870. 
The history of the German navy is one of foresight, calculation, 
consistency and therefore steady growth. The small naval force 
maintained by Prussia became the navy of the North 
German Federation after the war of 1866, and the 
Imperial navy after 187 1. Until 1853 it had been wholly de- 
pendent on the war office. In that year an admiralty was created 
in favour of Prince Albrecht, but this office was abolished in 1861, 
and the navy was again placed under the war office. The first 
ministers of the navy under the North German Federation were 
generals; so was the first imperial minister, General Stosch (1871). 
Admiral Tirpitz, appointed in 1897, was the first minister who 
was bred a seaman. His predecessor, General Stosch, had been 
an excellent organizer and had done much for the efficiency of 
the service. It has been the rule of the German government, 
both before and since the foundation of the empire, to advance 
by carefully framed plans, without adhering to them pedantically 
when circumstances called for a modification of their lines. As 
early as 1867 a scheme had been formed for the construction of 
a navy of 16 ironclads and 50 smaller vessels, at a cost of 
£5,395,833. It was not sufficiently advanced in execution to 
allow Germany to make any efforts at sea in the war of 1870-71. 
In 1872 a supplementary grant of £3,791,666 was made for 
construction in view of the increased cost of armour and arma- 
ments. In 1882 a revised scheme was made which contemplated 
the construction of 100 vessels, and it was completed in 1888 
by another which provided for the construction of 28 vessels, 
of which 4 should be battleships of the largest size, within the 
next six years. In 1894 and for some years afterwards the Reich- 
stag showed itself hostile to a heavy expenditure on the navy, 
and refused many votes asked for by the government. Under 
the pressure of ambition and of the real needs of a nation with 
an extensive and growing maritime commerce, the expenditure 
grew in spite of the opposition of the Reichstag. Between 1874 
and 1889 it rose from £1,950,000 to £2,750,000, and was increased 
in the following year to £3,600,000, from which figure it advanced 
by 1898 to £5,756,135. Another building scheme was framed 
in that year, but it was swept aside in 1000, under the combined 
influence of the exhortations of the emperor William II., and of 
the anger caused in Germany through the arrest by a British 
cruiser of a German steamer (the " Bundesrath ") on the coast of 
Africa on a charge of carrying contraband of war to the Boers. 
The emperor was now able to obtain the consent of the Reichstag 
to an extended Naval Defence Act. By the terms of this measure 
it was proposed to spend £74,000,000 on construction, and 
£20,000,000 on the dockyards. With this money, by the year 
191 7 Germany was to be provided with a fleet of 38 battleships, 
together with a proportionate number of cruisers and other 
smaller vessels. Rapid progress was made not only with the 
programme itself but with the equipment of German dockyards

and other establishments for providing the materiel of a great 
navy. In the spring of 1909 the serious menace to British 
supremacy at sea, represented by the growth of the new German 
fleet of battleships, led in England to a " scare " which recalled 
that of 1888, and to an energetic campaign for additional 
expenditure on the British navy. 

During the years following on the American Civil War (1862- 
66) the United States paid small attention to the navy. In 

1 881 a board was appointed to advise on the needs 
spates. °i t ^ ie navv > anc ^ in 1890, the board recommendecl 

the formation of a fleet of 100 vessels of which 20 
should be battleships of the largest class. The reviving interest 
in the navy was greatly stimulated by the diplomatic difference 
with Great Britain which arose over the frontier question between 
her and the republic of Venezuela in 1896. Resolutions were 
passed in -congress approving of an increase of the navy. The 
war with Spain in 1898 completed the revival of American 
interest in the navy. The acquisition of Porto Rico, and the 
protectorate of Cuba in the West Indies, together with the annexa- 
tion of the Philippines, and the visible approach of the time 
when the relations of the powers interested in the Pacific would 
call for regulation, confirmed the conviction that a powerful 
fleet must be maintained. In 1889 the United States possessed 
no modern battleship. In 1899 there were 4 built and 8 building. 
At the close of 1903 there were built and building 27 of 353,260 
tons, only two of them being of less than 10,000 tons. From 
£5,119,850 in 1890 the expenditure grew to £16,355,380 in 1903. 
The navy of Japan, the last comer among the great naval 
forces of the world, may be said to date from 1895, from, in 

r„ „- f act > the eve of the war with China. As an insular 
Japan, ' . , 

power with a large seafaring population, Japan is 
called upon to possess a fleet. Even in the days of its voluntary 
isolation it had a known capacity for maritime warfare. Its 
capacity for assimilating the ideas and mastering the mechanical 
skill of Europe have been in no respect better shown than in 
naval matters. From the moment it was compelled to open 
its ports it began not only to acquire steamers but to apply 
itself under European guidance to learning how to make and 
use them. A navy on the western model was already organized 
by 1895, but it was still of trifling proportions. In 1896 the 
Japanese navy had become an object of serious attention to 
the world. A plan was drafted in that year, and confirmed 
in the next, by which Japan arranged to supply itself, mainly 
by purchase in Europe, with a fleet containing 4 of the most 
powerful battleships. The scheme was modified in detail in 
1898, when the decision was taken to increase the tonnage of the 
vessels. A little later additions were arranged for, and vessels 
building for South America states in English ports were purchased. 
The British model was carefully followed in naval organization, 
the alliance with England giving special facilities for this. And 
by 1904, when the war with Russia began, the unknown Japanese 
fleet proved its competence by victories at sea which put the 
seal on her position as a naval power. 

Conclusion. — When we look over the whole period from 
the end of the Napoleonic wars, one great fact is patent to our 
view. It is that this was an epoch of revival or development 
in the naval power of the whole world, in the course of which 
the position held by Great Britain in 1816 was partially lost 
simply by the growth of other powers. The situation in that 
year was by its very nature temporary, and a quotation of the 
respective numbers of warships then possessed by the world 
would have no value. An instructive comparison can, however, 
be made between the year 1838, when Great Britain began to 
be seriously concerned with the rise of possible enemies at sea, 
1 and the eve of the war between Russia and Japan. Battleships 
may again be taken as the test of strength, since nothing happened 
in the Russo-Japanese War to show that they do not still form 
the most vital element of naval power. We may also leave 
aside the many small fleets which cannot act collectively, and 
which individually do not weigh in the balance. The figures 
for 1838 are given above, but may be repeated for comparison. 
In that year Great Britain possessed, built and building, 90 



ships of the line; France 49; Russia 50; the United States 
15. In 1903 the number of vessels recognized as battleships, 
possessed by the great powers, was for Great Britain 67; for 
France 39; for Russia 18; for the United States 27; for Germany 
27; for Italy 18; for Japan 5. At the first date the British 
fleet was among great powers as 90 to 114. At the latter it 
was as 67 to 134. 

Such comparisons, however, as these become much more 
complicated in later years, when the importance of the preponder- 
ance of " Dreadnoughts " — the new type of battleship — (see 
Ship and Shipbuilding) — was realized. By the invention 
of this type Great Britain appeared to obtain a new lead; and 
in 1907, when it was calculated that by 1910 there would be 
ten British " Dreadnoughts " actually in commission while 
neither in Europe nor America would a single similar ship have 
been completed by any foreign power, the situation seemed 
to be entirely in favour of complete supremacy at sea for the 
British fleet. But the progress of German and American con- 
struction, and particularly the experience gained of German 
ability to build and equip much more rapidly than had been 
supposed, showed by 1909 that, so far as " Dreadnoughts " 
were concerned at all events, the lead of Great Britain could only 
be maintained by exceptional effort and exceptional expenditure. 
It was admitted in parliament by the prime minister, first lord 
of the admiralty and foreign secretary — themselves Liberals 
who had flirted with proposals for disarmament, and who de- 
pended for office on the support of more extreme "pacifists" who 
objected on principle to heavy military and naval expenditure — 
that, while for the moment the British " two-power standard " 
was still in existence, the revelations as to German shipbuilding 
showed that it could only be maintained in the future by the 
creation of a new fleet on a scale previously not contemplated. 
The supremacy of Great Britain in ships of the older types 
would be of no avail as years went by and other powers were 
equalling her in the output of ships of the new type, and a new 
race thus began, of which it is impossible here to indicate more 
than the start. It was no longer a question of completed ships, 
but one still more of programmes for building and of the rate 
at which these programmes could be accomplished. At the 
beginning of 1910, while Great Britain had her ten " Dread- 
noughts," it was not the case that other powers had none: 
Germany already had four and the United States two; and 
a knowledge of the naval programmes of both these countries, 
to speak of no others, showed that, unless either their policy 
changed or the British shipbuilding programme was modified 
so as to keep up with their progress, it would not take many 
years before the theory of the equality of the British fleet in 
" capital ships " to those of the next two naval powers would 
have to be abandoned. In England this situation created a pro- 
found sensation in 1909, since it was common ground that her 
fleet was her all in all, on which her empire depended; and the 
result was seen, not only in a considerable increase in the Naval 
Estimates of 1910-1911, but also in the beginning of a serious ■ 
attempt to organize their fleets on the part of the British colonial 
dominions, which should co-operate with the mother country.

Bibliography. — Ancient and General: — Accounts of the naval 
organizations of the ancient world, and of the sea fighting of the time 
are to be found in the historians of Greece and Rome: Signor 
G. Corazzini has written a Storia delta marina militare antica (Livorno, 
1882). Valuable details of the Imperial Roman navy and of the 
Byzantine naw will be found in Professor Bury's appendices to his 
edition of Gibbon's Decline and Fall, vol. i. apx. 5, and vol. vi. 
apx. 5. General histories of the navies of the world have been 
written, but they are inevitably apt to be little more than jejune 
reviews of the dates, and results of battles. This is certainly the 
case with the great folio of the English writer Josiah Burchett, A 
Complete History of the most remarkable transactions at Sea, from the 
earliest accounts of time to the conclusion of the last war with France, 
wherein is given an account of the most considerable Naval Expeditions, 
Sea Fights, Stratagems, Discoveries and otJier Maritime Occurrences 
that have happened among all nations that have flourished at Sea; and 
in a more particular manner of Great Britain from the time of the 
Revolution %n 1688 to the aforesaid period (1720). The later part is 
however valuable, for Burchett, who was secretary to the admiralty, 
had access to good authorities for his own time, and had served at 
sea as secretary to Russell, Lord Orford. There is an Histoire de la 
marine de tous les peuples, by M._A. du Sein (Paris, 1879) which is of 
no great value. 

Medieval : — As regards the medieval navies the first place may be 
allowed to the Italians. A general bibliography of Italian nautical 
literature, Saggio de una bibliografia martttima italiana, occupying 
fifty-eight pages, drawn up by Signor Enrico Celani, will be foundin 
the Revista maritiima, supplement for 1894 (Rome). The histories 
of the different Republics of the middle ages record their maritime 
enterprises. An excellent book, which gives far more than its title 
promises, is the Storiadella marina pontificia of A.puglielmotti.O.P., 
in 10 volumes published at different times, and in two editions, at 
Florence 1856, &c. The general maritime history of the Mediter- 
ranean in the middle ages is well illustrated in the Memorias sobre 
la marina comercio y artes de Barcelona (1779-1792) by Don A. 
Capmany. The naval enterprises of the^ Norsemen are dealt with in 
a scholarly fashion by M. G. B. Depping, Histoire des expeditions 
maritimes des Normands (1826); and with newer knowledge by Mr 
C. F. Keary, The Vikings of Western Christendom (1891). The 
medieval periods of Western navies are treated in their respective 
naval histories. 

Great Britain: — The History of the Royal Navy to the French 
Revolution , by Sir N. Harris Nicolas (1847), is unfortunately in- 
complete. It ends at the year 1422, but is the work of a most labori- 
ous and exact antiquary, who had been a naval officer in his vouth. 
The administrative history of the British navy until 1660 is the 
subject of the History of the Administration of the Navy and of 
Merchant Shipping in relation to the Navy (1896) by Mr M. Oppenheim 
— a most valuable collection of materials. The campaigns and battles 
of the navy are told, generally from the public letters of the admirals, 
and with no great measure of criticism in several compilations. 
The Naval History of England (1735) by Mr T. Lediard, is copious and 
useful. The Naval Chronology, or an Historical Summary of Naval 
and Maritime Events from the Time of the Romans to the Treaty of 
Peace 1802, by Captain Isaac Schomberg (1802), contains a mass of 
valuable information, lists of ships, dates of construction, &c, and 
some administrative details. Less comprehensive, but still useful, is 
such a compilation as The General History of the Late War (that is, 
the Seven Years' War), by Dr John Entick " and other gentlemen " 
(1763). A much better book is The Naval and Military Memoirs of 
Great Britain 1727 to 1783 (1804) by Mr R. Beatson, a very careful 
and well-informed writer who had seen some service as a marine 
officer. The Lives of the British Admirals, containing a new and 
accurate Naval History from the earliest periods, by Dr T. Campbell 
( J 779)» ma Y be profitably consulted, with caution, for it by no means 
justifies its claim to novelty and accuracy in all parts. The Naval 
History of Great Britain, from 1793 to the accession of George IV., 
by Mr W. James (1827), republished with a continuation by Captain 
Chamier in 1837, is a standard authority. A far less useful work, 
which, however, is in parts written from first-hand knowledge, is The 
Naval History of Great Britain by Captain W. P. Brenton, first 
published in 1823, and republished in 1836. The Field of Mars, a 
compilation in dictionary form published in 1781, with an enormous 
title-page, is not without value for some of the naval transactions of 
the 1 8th century. The History of tlie British Navy from the Earliest 
Period to tlie Present Time (1863) by Dr C. D. Yonge, contains some 
original matter for the naval transactions of the 19th century. t The 
Royal Navy, in 7 large volumes (1897-1903), edited and partly written 
by Sir W. L. Clowes, is a compilation of unequal value. Some of 



Sir W. L. Clowes's coadjutors, notably Captain Mahan and Sir C. R. 
Markham, are of high standing and authority. The book is copiously 
illustrated. The Naval Chronicle, 1799-1818, a magazine, contains 
masses of useful matter, for the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. 
The Royal Naval Biography of Captain John Marshall, giving the 
lives of all officers on the list in 1823 or promoted later (1 823-1 835), 
with a supplement (1827-1830), may be consulted, but is too un- 
critical and too uniformly laudatory. The Naval Biographical 
Dictionary; life and services of every living officer (1846), by Lieutenant 
W. R. O'Bryne, is a solid book of reference. The publications of the 
Navy Record Society (1894 and subsequent years) contain large and 
valuable publications of original matter, with some reprints of old 
authorities, such as Sir W. Monson's Tracts, which were difficult of 
access. See also A Short History of the Royal Navy, by David 
Hannay. 

France: — The naval history of France has been much written 
about since i8ao. Not many of the books published have been of 
considerable value. The Histoire maritime de la France of M. L£on 
Guerin (1844), was meant to meet a popular demand and satisfy 
national vanity. The Histoire de la marine frangaise of M. Eugene 
Sue (1845-1846) is mainly a romance, but it contains some useful 
evidence. The Histoire de la marine francaise of Le Comte de Bonfils 
Lablenie (1845), a naval officer, is of more value, but is somewhat 
wanting in criticism. The Precis historique de la marine francaise 
of M. Chasseriau (1845); the Histoire ginerale de la marine (1853); 
the Histoire de la marine franchise of M. le Saint (1877); and the 
Histoire nationale de la marine francaise depuis Jean Bart (1878) 
of M. Trousset are compilations. La Marine de guerre, ses institu- 
tions militaires depuis son origine jusqu'ti nos jours, by Cap™ 
Gougeard (1877); the Essai sur Vhistoire de V administration de la 
martne francaise of M. Lambert de Sainte Croix (1892); and the 
excellent little book of M. Loir on La Marine ro'yale, 1789 (n.d.), 
may be consulted with pleasure and profit. The three books of 
M. Jal, Archiologie novate (1840), Glossaire nautique (1848) and 
Abraham du Quesne et la marine de son temps (1872) are all of high 
value. Les Batailles navales de la France of Cap™ Troude (1867), 
is a carefully written account of naval actions. The Histoire de la 
marine frangaise, pendant la guerre de Vindependence amhicaine 
(1877); Sous la premiere ripublique (1886); Sous le consulat et 
Vempire (1886); De 1815 b\ 1870 (1900); and La Marine francaise et 
la marine allemande, 1870-1871 (1873) of Cap™ Chevalier, are 
thorough and critical. M. G. Lacour-Gayet, Professor at L'Ecole 
supeneure de la Marine, has published two books of serious research, 
but marked by some national prejudice, La Marine militaire de la 
France sous le regne de Louis XV. (1902), and La Marine militaire de 
la France sous le regne de Louis XVL (1905). The Recherches sur 
Vancien clos des galees de Rouen (1864) of M. C. de Robillard de 
Beaurepairc, and the life of Jean de Vienne by the Marquis Terrier de 
Loray (1878), are valuable monographs on passages of early French 
naval history. The Projets et tentatives de debarquement aux lies 
britanniques by Cap™ Desbrierc (1900 seq.) is a most valuable 
authority. A' very scholarly Histoire de la marine francaise was 
begun in 1899 by M. C. de la Ronciere. 

Miscellaneous : — The standard authorities for Spanish naval history 
are, La Marina de Costilla (1892), and La Armada Espanola desde la 
union de Castilla y Aragon (1895-1901), of Captain Cesareo Fernandez 
Duro. The Geschienes van het Nederlandsche Zeewezen of Mr J. C. de 
Jonghe (1858), is an admirable and exhaustive history of the Dutch 
navy. The History of the Maritime Wars of the Turks, by Haji 
Khalfa (or Hugji Chalifa), translated by Mr J. Mitchell for the 
Oriental Translation Fund (1831), may be read with curiosity and 
some profit. There are two general histories of the navy of the 
United States by Fenimore Cooper (1839), and by Mr E. S. Maclay 
(1894); the second is the fuller, and the more critical. Captain 
Mahan's Influence of Sea Power on History 1660-1783 (1890), and his 
Influence of Sea Power upon the French Revolution and Empire 1703- 
1812 (1892), must be classed apart as studies of the general inter- 
action of navies on one another and on international relations. 
The long series of readable monographs by Admiral Jurien de la 
Graviere, covering the whole field of naval warfare from the 
Peloponnesian War to his own time, contain much information and 
sound criticism. (D. H.) 

Naval Strategy and Tactics 

Historical Evolution. — That the methods of conducting war 
at sea have been conditioned by the capacity of the ships and 
their armament, and that capacity and armament have interacted 
upon one another, may appear to be platitudes. But they are 
none the less truths which must always be borne in mind when 
we are considering the history of naval strategy, that is, of the 
large movements by which a commander secures the advantage 
of fighting at a place convenient to himself, or of tactics — which 
are the movements he makes in battle. Throughout antiquity 
and the middle ages till the 16th century, the weapons relied 
on were — (1) the ship itself, used as a ram, (2) the swords of the 
crew, (3) such missile weapons as bolts from heavy crossbows

a yard or pole rigged out, and the various means of setting an 
enemy alight; by shooting arrows with burning tow or by 
Greek fire or wild fire, blown through tubes (cannae, whence 
f cannon "). The nature of the " Greek fire " is still an unsettled 
question, and it is believed by some authorities that the Byzan- 
tines of the middle ages were acquainted with the use of gun- 
powder. However that may be, it is certain that even after 
the introduction of artillery in the 14th century, the 
means of injuring an enemy at a distance were nil, or 
were very feeble. All actions, therefore, were fought 
at close quarters, where ramming and boarding were possible. 
But the use of the ram was only available for a vessel driven by 
oars. A sailing vessel could not ram unless she were running 
before a good breeze. In a light wind her charge would be 
ineffective, and it could not be made at all from leeward. There- 
fore, while fleets depended on the methods of battle at close 
quarters, two conditions were imposed on the warship. She 
must be small and light, so that her crew could row her with 
effect, and she must carry a v numerous crew to work her oars 
and board or repel boarders. Sails were used by the triremes 
and other classes of warship, ancient and medieval, when going 
from point to point — to relieve the rowers from absolutely 
exhausting toil. They were lowered in action, and when the 
combatant had a secure port at hand, they were left ashore 
before battle. These conditions applied alike to Phormio, the 
Athenian admiral of the 5th century B.C., to the Norse king Olaf 
Tryggveson of the 10th century a.d., and to the chiefs of the 
Christian and Turkish fleets which fought the battle of Lepanto 
in a.d. 1571. There might be, and were, differences of degree 
in the use made of oar and sail respectively. Outside the 
Mediterranean, the sea was unfavourable to the long, narrow 
and light galley of 120 ft. long and 20 ft. of beam. But the Norse 
ship found at Gokstad, though her beam is a third of her length, 
and she is well adapted for rough seas, is also a light and shallow 
craft, to be easily rowed or hauled up on a beach. Some medieval 
vessels were of considerable size, but these were the exception; 
they were awkward, and were rather transports than warships. 
Given a warship which is of moderate size and crowded with 
men, it follows that prolonged cruises, and blockade in the full 
sense of the word, were beyond the power of the sea commanders 
of antiquity and the middle ages. There were ships used for 
trade which with a favourable wind could rely on making six 
knots an hour — that is to say, twice the average speed attained 
by Captain Cook in his voyages of exploration. But a war fleet 
could not provide the cover, or carry the water and food, needed 
to keep the crews efficient during a long cruise. So long as galleys 
were used, that is to say, till the middle of the 18th century, they 
were kept in port as much as possible, and a tent was rigged over 
the deck to house the rowers. The fleet was compelled to hug 
the shore in order to find supplies. ' It always endeavoured to 
secure a basis on shore to store provisions and rest the crews. 
Therefore the wider operations were slowly made. Therefore 
too, when the enemy was to be waited for, or a port watched, 
some point on shore was secured and the ships were drawn up. 
It was by holding such a point that the Corinthian allies of the 
Syracusans were able to pin in the Athenians. The Romans 
watched Lilybeum in the same way, and Hannibal the Rhodian 
could run the blockade before they were launched and ready to 
stop him. The Norsemen hauled their ships on shore, stockaded 
them and marched inland. The Greeks of Homer had done the 
same and could do nothing else. Roger di Lauria, in a.d. i 285, 
waited at the Hormigas with his galleys on the beach till the 
French were seen to be coming past him. Edward III. in 
a.d. 1350, stayed at Winchelsea till the Spaniards were sighted. 
The allies at Lepanto remained at anchor near Dragon era till 
the last moment. 

Given again that the fighting was at close quarters with ram, 
stroke of sword, crossbow bolt, arrow, pigs of iron or lead and 
wild fire blown through tubes, it follows that the formations 
and tactics were equally imposed on the combatants. The 
formation was inevitably the line abreast — the ships going side

by side — for the object was to bring all the rams, or all the 
boarders into action at once. It was quite as necessary to strike 
with the prow when boarding as when ramming. If the vessels 
were laid side by side the oars would have prevented them 
from touching. It may be added that this rule prevailed equally 
with the sailing ship of later times, since they were built with 
what is technically called " a tumble home," that is to say, their 
sides sloped inwards from the water line, and the space from 
the top of the bulwarks of one to the other was too great to be 
jumped. The extent to which ramming or boarding would be 
used respectively would depend on the skill of the rowers. The 
highly trained Athenian crews of the early Pelopon- 
nesian War relied mainly on the ram. They aimed at « nc/ l fl * 
dashing through an enemy's line, and shaving off the m€ thods. 
oars from one side of an opponent. When successfully 
practised, this manoeuvre would be equivalent to the dismasting 
of a sailing line of battle ship. It was the 5ukit\ov$, and it 
enabled the assailant to turn, and ram his crippled enemy in 
the stern (7repi7r\ovs) But an attack with the ram might be 
exceedingly dangerous to the assailant, if he were not very 
solidly built. His ram might be broken off in the shock. The 
Athenians found this a very real peril, and were compelled to 
construct their triremes with stronger bows, to contend with the 
more heavily built Peloponnesian vessels — whereby they lost 
much of their mobility. In fact success in ramming depended 
so much on a combination of skill and good fortune that it 
played a somewhat subordinate part in most ancient sea fights. 
The Romans baffled the ramming tactics of the Carthaginians 
by the invention of the corva or crow, which grappled the prow 
of the rammer, and provided a gangway for boarders. After 
the introduction of artillery in the 14th century, when guns 
were carried in the bows of the galley, it was considered bad 
management to fire them until the prow was actually touching 
the enemy. If they were discharged before the shock there 
was always a risk that they would be fired too soon, and the guns 
of the time could not be rapidly reloaded. The officer-like course 
was to keep the fire for the last moment, and use it to clear the 
way for the boarders. As a defence against boarding, the ships 
of a weaker fleet were sometimes tied side to one another, in the ■ 
middle ages, and a barrier made with oars and spars. But this 
defensive arrangement, which was adopted by Olaf Tryggveson of 
Norway at Swolder (a.d. iooo), and by the French at Sluys 
(a.d. 1340), could be turned by an enemy who attacked on the 
flank. To meet the shock of ramming and to ram, medieval 
ships were sometimes " bearded," i.e. fortified with iron bands 
across the bows. 

The principles of naval warfare known to the ancient world 
descended through Byzantium to the Italian Republics and from 
them to the West. With the growth of ships, the 
development of artillery, and the beginning of the great S hipsf 
sailing fleets capable of keeping the sea for long 
periods together, came the need for a new adaptation of old 
principles. A ship which depended on the wind for its motive 
power could not hope to ram. It could still board, and the 
Spaniards did for long make it their main object to run their 
bow over an enemy's sides, and invade his deck. In order to 
carry out this kind of attack they would naturally try to get 
to windward and then bear down before the wind in line abreast 
ship upon ship. But an opponent to leeward could always baffle 
this attack by edging away, and in the meantime fire with his 
broadside to cripple his opponent's spars. Experience soon 
showed the more intelligent sea officers of all nations, that a 
ship which relied on broadside fire, must present her broadside 
to the enemy; it was also soon seen that in order to give full 
play to the guns of the fleet, the ships must follow one another. 
Thus there arose the practice of arranging ships in the line 
ahead j one behind the other. For a time sea-officers were 
inclined to doubt whether order could be maintained among 
vessels subject to the forces of wind and tide. But in the very 
first years of the 16th century, a Spanish writer of the name of 
Alonso de Chaves argued with force that even an approach to 
order is superior to none — and that, given the accidents of

[STRATEGY AND TACTICS 



wind and tide, the advantage would rest with him who took 
his precautions. The truth was so obvious that it could not but 
be universally accepted. The line ahead then became 
btttie."* " the Kne o* "battle." This term has a double mean- 
ing. It may mean the formation, but it may also 
mean the ships which are fit to form parts of the line in action. 
The practice of sorting out ships, so as to class those fit to be 
in a line of battle apart from others, dates from the second 
half of the 17th century. Its advantages had been seen before, 
but the classification was not made universal till then. The 
excessive number of ships collected in those naval wars, their 
variety in size, and the presence in the fleets of a large proportion 
of pressed or hired merchant ships had led to much bad execu- 
tion. But in the final battles of the first war between England 
and the Dutch Republic (1652-53), the Parliamentary admirals 
enforced the formation of the line by strong measures. On the 
conclusion of the war, they drew up the first published code of 
fighting instructions. These give the basis of the whole tactical 
system of the 17th and 18th centuries in naval warfare. The 
treatises of Paul Hoste, Bigot de Morogues and Bourde de 
Villehuet, which were the text-books of the time, all French in 
origin but all translated into other languages, are commentaries 
•upon and developments of this traditional code of practice. 

The governing principles were simple and were essentially 
sound. The ships were arranged in a line, in order that each 
should have her broadside free to fire into the enemy 
^ifi^htl* w ^ tnout running the risk of firing into her own friends. 
tactfcs. ° g I n order to remove the danger that they would 
touch each other, a competent space, to allow for a 
change of course in case of need, was left between them. It 
was fixed at two cables — that is, 200 fathoms, or 400 yds. 
— though less room was occasionally taken. To reduce the 
number of men required to handle the sails, and leave them 
free to fight the guns, the ships fought under reduced canvas. 
But it was necessary to retain the power to increase the speed of 
a ship rapidly. This was secured by not sheeting home one of the 
sails — that is to say, it was left loose, and the wind was "spilt 
out of it." When the vessel was required to shoot ahead it was 
easy to sheet the sail home, and " let all draw." The fleets would 
fight " on the wind " — that is to say, with the wind on the side, 
because they were then under better control. With the wind 
blowing 'from behind they would take the wind out of one 
another's sails. When the course had to be altered, the ships 
turned by tacking — that is, head to wind — or by wearing — 
that is, stern to wind, cither together or in succession. To tack 
or wear a large fleet in succession was a very lengthy operation. 
The second ship did not tack, or wear, till she had reached the 
place where the first had turned, and so on, down the whole line. 
By tacking or wearing together the order of a fleet was reversed, 
the van becoming the rear, and the rear the van. It must be 
remembered that a fleet was divided into van, centre and rear, 
which kept their names even when the order was reversed. 
Orders were given by signals from the flag-ship, but as they 
could not be seen by the ships in a line with her, frigates were 
stationed on the side of the line opposite to that facing the 
enemy " to repeat signals." 

A main object which the admirals who drafted the orders 
had before them was to obviate the risk that the enemy would 
double on one end of the line and put it between two fires. 
It is obvious that if two fleets, A and B, are sailing, both with 
the wind on the right side, and the leading ship of A comes 
into action with the seventh or eighth of B, then six or seven 
leading ships of B's line will be free to turn and surround the 
head of A's line. This did actually happen at the battle of 
Beachy Head. Therefore, the orders enjoin on the admiral the 
strict obligation to come into action in such a way that his leading 
ship shall steer with the leading ship of the enemy, and his rear 
with the rear. The familiar expression of the British navy was 
" to take every man his bird." 

The regular method of fighting battles was thus set up. In 
itself it was founded on sound principles. As it was framed when 
the enemies kept in view were the Dutch, who in seamanship 



and gunnery were fully equal to the British, its authors were 
justified in prescribing the safe course. Unhappily they added 
the direction that a British admiral was to keep his fleet, through- 
out the battle, in the order in which it was begun. Therefore 
he could take no advantage of any disorder which might occur 
in the enemy's lines. When therefore the conflict came to be 
between the British and the French in the 18th century, battles 
between equal or approximately equal forces were for long 
inconclusive. The French, who had fewer ships than the British, 
were anxious to fight at the least possible cost, lest their fleet 
should be worn out by severe action, leaving Great Britain 
with an untouched balance. Therefore, they preferred to engage 
to leeward, a position which left them free to retreat before the 
wind. They allowed the British fleet to get to windward, and, 
when it was parallel with them and bore up before the wind to 
attack, they moved onwards. The attacking fleet had then to 
advance, not directly before the wind with .its ships moving 
along lines perpendicular to the line attacked, but in slanting 
or curving lines. The assailants would be thrown into " a bow 
and quarter line " — that is to say? with the bow of the second 
level with the after part of the first and so on from end to end. 
In the case of a number of ships of various powers of sailing, it 
was a difficult formation to maintain. The result was that the 
ships of the assailing line which were steering to attack the 
enemy's van came into action first and were liable to be crippled 
in the rigging. If the same formation was to be maintained, 
the others were now limited to the speed of the injured vessels, 
and the enemy to leeward slipped away. At all times a fleet 
advancing from windward was liable to injury in spars, even if 
the leeward fleet did not deliberately aim at them. The leeward 
ships would be leaning away from the wind, and their shot would 
always have a tendency to fly high. So long as the assailant 
remained to windward, the ships to leeward could always slip 
off. 

The inconclusive results of so many battles at sea excited 
the attentions of a Scottish gentleman, Mr Clerk of Eldin (1728- 
181 2), in the middle of the 1 8th century. He began a 
series of speculations and calculations, which he em- ttJorhs* 
bodied in pamphlets and distributed among naval 
officers. They were finally published in book form in 1790 and 
1797. The hypothesis which governs all Clerk's demonstrations 
is that as the British navy was superior in gunnery and seaman- 
ship to their enemy, it was their interest to produce a melee. 
He advanced various ingenious suggestions for concentrating 
superior forces on parts of the enemy's line — by preference on 
the rear, since the van must lose time in turning to its support. 
They are all open to the criticism that an expert opponent could 
find an answer to each of them. But that must be always the 
case, and victory is never the fruit of a skilful movement alone, 
but of that superiority of skill or of moral strength which enables 
one combatant to forestall or to crush another by more rapid 
movement or greater force of blow. Clerk's theories had at 
least this merit that they must infallibly tend to make battles 
decisive by throwing the combatants into a furious mingled 
strife. 

The unsatisfactory character of the accepted method of 
fighting battles at sea had begun to be obvious to naval officers, 
both French and English, who were Clerk's contemporaries. 
The great French admiral Suffren condemned naval tactics as 
being little better than so many excuses for avoiding a real 
fight. He endeavoured to find a better method, by concentrating 
superior forces on parts of his opponent's line in some of his 
actions with the British fleet in the East Indies in 1782 and 1783. 
But his orders were ill obeyed, and the quality of his fleet was 
not superior to the British. Rodney, in his first battle in the 
West Indies in 1780, endeavoured to concentrate a superior 
force on part of his enemy's line by throwing a greater number 
of British ships on the rear of the French line. But his directions 
were misunderstood and not properly executed. Moreover he 
did not then go beyond trying to place a larger number of ships 
in action to windward against a smaller number to leeward by 
arranging them at a less distance than two-cables length. But

an enemy who took the simple and obvious course of closing his 
line could baffle the attack, and while the retreat to leeward 
remained open could still slip away. On the 12th of April 1782 
(battle of Dominica) Rodney was induced, by the disorder in the 
French line, to break his own formation and pass through the 
enemy. He took the French flag-ship and five other vessels. 
The favourable result of this departure from the old practice of 
keeping the formation intact throughout the battle ruined the 
moral authority of the orthodox system of tactics. In the French 
war which began in 1793 Lord Howe (battle of 1st of June) 
ordered his fleet to steer through the enemy, and to put them- 
selves on his line only as a means of bringing his fleet into action, 
and then played to produce a melee in which the individual 
superiority of his vessels would have free play. Throughout the 
war, which lasted, with a brief interval of peace, from 1793 
to 18 1 5, British admirals grew constantly bolder in the method 
they adopted for producing the desired mel6e (battles of St 
Vincent, Camperdown, Trafalgar). It has sometimes been argued 
that their line of attack was rash and would have proved 
disastrous if tried against more skilful opponents. But this 
is one of those criticisms which are of value only against those 
who think that there can be a magic efficacy in any particular 
attack, which makes its success infallible. That the tactics of 
British admirals of the great wars of 1793-1815 had in themselves 
no such virtue was amply demonstrated at the engagement 
off Lissa in 181 1. They were justified because the reliance of 
admirals on the quality of their fleets was well founded. It 
should be borne in mind that a vessel while bearing down on an 
enemy's line could not be exposed to the fire of three enemies 
at once when at a less distance than 750 yds., because the guns 
could not be trained to converge on a nearer point. The whole 
range of effective fire was only a thousand yards or a very little 
over. The chance that a ship would be dismasted and stopped 
before reaching the enemy's line was small. 

The improvements in the construction of ships, which had so 
much influence on the development of tactics, had its effect also 
influence on strate &y- The great aims of a fleet in war must be 
otim» to keep the coast of its own country free from attack, 
proved to secure the freedom of its trade, and to destroy 
A^z/rf/ *^e enem y ,s A ee t or confine it to port. The first and 
second of these purposes can be attained by the 
successful achievement of the third — the destruction or paralysis 
of the hostile fleet. But till after the end of the 17th century 
it was thought impossible, or at least very rash, to keep the great 
ships out of port between September and May or June. Therefore 
continuous watch on an enemy by blockading his ports was 
beyond the power of any navy. Therefore too, as the opponent 
might be at sea before he could be stopped, the movements of 
fleets were much subordinated to the need for providing convoy 
to the trade. It was not till the middle of the 18th century that 
the continuous blockade first* carried out by Lord Hawke in 
"1758-59, and then brought to perfection by Earl St Vincent 
and other 3ritish admirals between 1793 and 181 5, became 
possible. 

Modern Times. — The interval of ninety years between 181 5 
and 1904 (the opening of the Russo-Japanese conflict) was 
marked by no naval war. There was fighting at sea, and there 
were prolonged blockades, but there were no encounters between 
large and well appointed navies. During this period an entire 
revolution took place in the means of propulsion, armament and 
material of construction of ships. Steam was applied to war- 
« ships, at first as an auxiliary force, in the second quarter of the 
19th century. The Crimean War gave a great stimulus to the 
development of the guns. It also brought about the application 
of iron to ships as a cuirass. Very soon metal was adopted as the 
material out of which ships were made. The extended use of 
shells, by immensely increasing the danger of fire, rendered so 
inflammable a substance as wood too dangerous for employment 
in a war-ship. France has the honour of having set the example 
of employing iron as a cuirass, while England was the first to 
take it as the sole material. Changes so sweeping as these could 
not take place without affecting all the established ideas as to 



the conduct of war at sea. The time of revolution in means of 
propulsion, armament and construction was also a time of much 
speculation. Doubts and obscurities remained unsolved because 
they had never been brought to the test of actual fighting on 
an adequate scale. As the 19th century drew to a close, another 
element of uncertainty was introduced by the development of 
the torpedo. A weapon which is a floating and moving mine, 
capable up to a certain point of being directed on its course, 
invisible or very hard to trace, and able to deliver its blow 
beneath the water-line, was so complete a novelty that its action 
was hard indeed to foresee and therefore particularly liable to 
be exaggerated. From the torpedo sprang too the submarine 
vessel, which aims at striking below the surface, where it itself 
is, like its weapon, invisible, or nearly so. 

How to solve the problems which science has set has been the 
task of thoughtful naval officers — and of the governments which 
the military seaman serves. The questions to be solved may be 
stated in the following order. What would be the effect: 1st, 
of the employment of steam, or of any substitute for steam other 
than the wind or the oar; 2nd, of the development of the gun; 
3rd, of the use of metal as a material of construction; 4th, of 
the use of a weapon and a vessel acting below the surface of the 
water, and if not wholly invisible at least very much hidden? r 

The belief that steam had given the lesser fleet an advantage 
over the greater — that it had, in a phrase once popular among 
Englishmen, " bridged the Channel," — need only be touched 
on for its historical interest. It was an intelligible, perhaps 
pardonable, example of the confusion produced by a novelty of 
improved capacity on the minds of those who were not prepared 
to consider it in all its bearings. A moment's thought ought to 
have shown that where both sides had the command of steam, 
the proportion between them would remain what it was before. 
The only exception would be that the fleet which was steering in 
a direction already laid down would have a somewhat greater 
advantage than of old, over another which was endeavouring to 
detect its presence and course. Its movements would be more 
rapid, and it could steam through a fog by which it would be 
hidden in a way impossible for a sailing ship. On the other 
hand, such a fleet could be much more rapidly pursued and" 
interrupted when once its course was known. The influence 
which the freedom and certainty of movement conferred by 
steam would have on the powers of fleets and ships presented 
a problem less easy to dispose of. Against the advantage they 
conferred was to be set the limitation they imposed. The 
necessity for replacing indispensable fuel was a restriction 
unknown to the sailing ship, which needed only to renew its 
provisions and water — stores more easily obtained all the world 
over than coal. Hence doubts naturally arose as to how far a 
state which did not possess coaling stations in all parts of the 
world could conduct extensive operations over great distances. 
The events of the recent Russo-Japanese War lead to the con- 
clusion that the obligation to obtain coal has not materially 
limited the freedom of movement of fleets. By carrying store 
vessels with him, by coaling at sea, and taking advantage of the 
friendly neutrality of certain ports on his route, the Russian 
admiral, Rojdesvensky, reached the Far East in 1905 in less time 
and with less difficulty than he could have done in days when 
he would have been liable to delay by calms, contrary winds and 
loss of spars in gales. The amount of skill on the part of the 
crews required to carry a fleet a" long distance would even appear 
to be less than it was of old. From this it would seem to follow 
that modern fleets possess no less capacity than the old sailing 
fleets for the great operations of war at a distance, or for main- 
taining blockades. Advantage and disadvantage counterbalance 
one another, and the proportion remains the same. Blockade 
is only another name for the maintenance of a watch on an 
enemy's squadron in port by a force capable of fighting him if 
he comes out. Admiral Togo blockaded the Russian squadron at 
Port Arthur in 1904 as effectually as any admiral has done the 
work in the past. The mobility given to the blockaded fleet by 
steam has been exactly counterbalanced by the increased 
mobility of the watch. The proportions remain the same.

[STRATEGY AND TACTICS 



But if the power to undertake far-ranging operations, and to 
confine an enemy to port by keeping him under observation, 
and driving him back when he comes out remains the same, the 
strategy of war at sea cannot have undergone any material altera- 
tion. The possession of ports where stores can be accumulated 
and repairs effected is an advantage as it always was. But a 
powerful fleet when operating far from its own country can supply 
itself with a store-house (a base) on the enemy's coast, or can be 
served at sea by store-ships, as of old. If beaten, it will suffer 
from the want of places of refuge as it always did. 

Among the speculations of recent years, a good deal has been 
heard of the " fleet in being." If this phrase is only used to 

mean that, so long as any part of an enemy's navy 
ihriar"* 8 * s ca P a ^ e °* actm S w * tn effect, its existence cannot be 

ignored with the certainty of safety, then the words 
convey a truth which applies to all war whether by land or 
sea. If it means, as it was at least sometimes clearly intended 
to mean, that no such operation as the transport of troops 
oversea can be undertaken with success, so long as the naval 
forces of an opponent are not wholly destroyed, it is con- 
trary to ancient experience. The Japanese in' the beginning of 
1904 hegan transporting troops to Korea before they had beaten 
♦the Russians, and they continued to send them in spite of the 
risk of interruption by the Vladivostok squadron. There was a 
risk, but risk is inseparable from war. The degree which can be 
incurred with sanity depends on the stake at issue, the nature of 
the circumstance and the capacity of the persons, which vary 
infinitely and must be separately judged. 

The war of 1904-05 may also be said to have shown that the 
vast change in the construction of ships, together with the develop- 

ment of old and the invention of new weapons, has 
amm ng. ^ QnG £ ar j ess tQ a j ter ^ e course of battles at sea than 

had been thought likely. Two calculations have been successively 
made and have hcen supported with plausibility. The first was 
that steam would enable the ship herself to be used as a projectile 
and that the use of the ram would again become common. 
The sinking of the " Re d 'Italia " by the Austrian ironclad 
Ferdinand Max at the battle of Lissa in 1866 seemed to give 
force to this supposition. Accidental collisions such as those 
between the British war-ships " Vanguard " and " Iron Duke," 
" Victoria " and " Camperdown " have also shown how fatal a 
wound may be given by the ram of a modern ship. But the 
sinking of the " Re d'ltalia " was largely an accident. As 
between vessels both under full control, a collision is easily 
avoided where there is space to move. In a melee, or pell-mell 
battle, to employ Nelson's phrase, opportunities would occur for 
the use of the ram. But the activity of science has developed 
one weapon to counterbalance another. The torpedo has made 
it very dangerous for one fleet to rush at another. A vessel 
To does cannot nre torpedoes ahead, and when charging home 
* at an opponent presenting his broadside would be liable 
to be struck by one. The torpedo may be said therefore to have 
excluded the pell-mell battle and the use of the ram except 
on rare occasions. But then arose the question whether the 
torpedo itself would not become the decisive weapon in naval 
warfare. It is undoubtedly capable of producing a great effect 
when its power can be fully exerted. A school arose, having 
its most convinced partisans in France, which argued that, as a 
small vessel could with a torpedo destroy a great battle-ship, the 
first would drive the second off the sea. The battle-ship was to 
give place to the torpedo-boat or torpedo-boat-destroyer which 
was itself only a torpedo-boat of a larger growth. But the 
torpedo is subject to close restrictions. It cannot be used with 
effect at more than two thousand yards. It ^passes through 
a resisting medium, which renders its course uncertain and 
comparatively slow, so that a moving opponent can avoid it. 
The vessel built to use it can be easily sunk by gun-fire. By 
night the risk from gun-fire is less, but science has nullified 
what she had done. The invention of the search-light has made 
it possible to keep the waters round a ship under observation 
all night. In the war between Russia and Japan the torpedo 
was at first used with success, but the injury it produced fell 



below expectations, even when allowance is made for the fact that 
the Russian squadron at Port Arthur had the means of repair close 
at hand. In the sea fights of the war it was of subordinate use, 
and indeed was not employed except to give the final stroke to, 
or force the surrender of, an already crippled ship. This war 
(and as much may be said for the war hetween the United States 
and Spain) confirmed an old experience. A resolute attempt 
was made by the Americans to block or hlind (in the modern 
phrase to " bottle-up ") the entrance to Santiago de Cuba by 
sinking a ship in it. The Japanese renewed the attempt on a 
great scale, and with the utmost intrepidity, at Port Arthur; 
but though a steamer can move with a speed and precision im- 
possible to a sailing ship, and can therefore be sunk more surely 
at a chosen spot, the experiment failed. Neither Americans 
nor Japanese succeeded in preventing their enemy from coming 
out when he wished to come. 

Since neither ram nor torpedo has established the claim made 
for it, the cannon remains " the queen of battles at sea." It 
can still deliver its blows at the greatest distance, and Q Unm fi re 
in the greatest variety of circumstances. The change 
has hcen in the method in which its power is applied. Now, 
as in former times, the aim of a skilful officer is to concentrate 
a superior force on a part of his opponent's formation. When 
the range of effective fire was a thousand or twelve hundred 
yards, and when guns could only be trained over a small segment 
of a circle because they were fired out of ports, concentration 
could only be effected by bringing a larger number of ships into 
close action with a smaller. To-day when gun-fire is effective even 
at seven thousand yards, and when guns fired from turrets and 
barbettes have a far wider sweep, concentration can be effected 
from a distance. The power to effect it must be sought by a 
judicious choice of position. It is true that greater rapidity and 
precision of fire produce concentration in one way. If of two 
forces engaged one can bring forty guns to bear on a chosen 
point of its opponent's formations, while that opponent can 
bring fifty guns to bear on a part of it, the superiority would 
seem to-be with the larger number. But this is by no means 
necessarily the case. The smaller number of guns may give 
the greater number of blows if fired with greater speed and 
accuracy. Yet no commander has a right to rely on such a 
superiority as this till it has been demonstrated, as it had been 
in the case of the British fleet by the time that Trafalgar was 
fought. Therefore an able chief will always play for position. 
He will do so all the more because an advantage of position adds 
to any other which he may possess. He may dispense with it 
for a particular reason at a given moment and in reliance on 
other sources of strength, but he will not throw it away. 

When position is to be secured the first condition to be thought 
of is the order in which it is to be sought for. The " line ahead " 
was imposed on the sailing fleets by the peremptory p m 
need for bringing, or at least retaining the power to 
bring, all their broadsides into action. Experiments made during- 
manoeuvres by modern navies, together with the experience 
gained in the war of 1904-05 in the Far East, have combined to 
show that no material change has taken place in this respect. 
It is still as necessary as ever that all the guns should he so placed 
as to be capable of being brought to bear, and it is still a condition 
imposed by the physical necessities of the case that this freedom 
can only be obtained when ships follow one another in a line. 
When in pursuit or flight, or when steaming on the look-out for 
a still unseen enemy, a fleet may be arranged in the " line 
abreast." A pursuing fleet would have to run the risk of being 
struck by torpedoes dropped by a retreating enemy. But it 
would have the advantage of being able to bring all its guns 
which can fire ahead to bear on the rear-ship of the enemy. 
When an opponent is prepared to give battle, and turns his broad- 
side so as to bring the maximum of his gun-fire to bear, he must 
be answered by a similar display of force — in other words, 
the line ahead must be formed to meet the line ahead. 

Both fleets being in this formation, how is the concentration 
of a superior force to be effected? If the opponents are equal 
in number, speed, armament, gunnery and the leadership of the 






NAWAB— NAWANAGAR 



3i7 



chiefs, accident alone can confer an advantage on either of them. 
Where equal weights are tried on accurate scales one cannot 
force up the other, but this evenness of power is rarely met 
in war by land or sea. The knowledge that it existed would 
probably prevent an appeal to arms between nations, since 
no decisive result could be hoped for. It is needless to insist 
that superior numbers make the task of concentrating com- 
paratively easy, unless counterbalanced by a great inferiority 
in speed. Speed is the quality which an admiral will wish his 
fleet to possess, in order that he may have the power to choose 
his point of attack. The swifter of two forces, otherwise equal, 
can always get ahead of its opponent, and then by 
turning inwards bring the leading ship of the force 
it is attacking into a curve of fire. The leader of the slower 
fleet can avoid the danger by also turning inwards. By so doing 
he will keep the assailant on his beam, opposite his side. Then 
the two fleets will tend to swing round in two circles having 
a common centre, the swifter going round the outer circumference 
and the slower round the inner. As the difference in length 
of these two lines would be always great and perhaps immense, 
the less speedy fleet could easily avoid the risk of being headed. 
On the other hand the outer fleet will be in a concave formation, 
and therefore able to bring all its guns to bear on the same point, 
while the inner fleet will be in a convex line, so that it will be 
unable to bring the guns of both van and rear to bear on the 
same mark. The advantage is obvious, but it may perhaps 
be easily exaggerated. The swifter fleet on the larger circle can 
in theory concentrate all its fire on one point, but all" its ships 
will still be under fire, and in practice it is found very difficult 
to make men neglect the enemy who is actually hitting them, 
and apply their attention entirely to another. Moreover the 
ships on the outer circle, having the larger line to cover, cannot 
allow themselves the same margin of steam-power to make 
good loss of speed by injury from shot. A fleet would not go 
at its maximum rate of common speed in action. A blow on 
the water-line might fill part of the ship's watertight compart- 
ments and reduce her speed. She must be able to make good 
the loss by putting on a greater pressure of steam, which she 
would not be able to do if already going at her maximum rate. 
In actual battle very much will depend on the respective skill 
of the gunnery. The swifter fleet might well find its superiority 
neutralised by the crippling of two or three of its leading ships. 
In such an action as this it will be, if not impossible, at least 
exceedingly difficult to give orders by signal. An admiral will 
therefore have to direct by example, which he cannot do except 
by placing his flag-ship at the head of the line. In that place 
he will be marked out as a target for the enemy's concentrated 
fire. He may indeed decide to direct the battle by signal from 
outside the line. Yet the difficulty he will find in seeing what 
is happening, as well as the difficulty the captains will find 
in seeing the signals, will always be so great, that in all probability 
the admirals of the future, will, like Nelson, be content to lay 
down the general principles on which the battle is to be fought, 
and trust the captains to apply them as circumstances arise. 
A large measure of independence must needs be allowed to the 
captains in the actual stress of battle. Ships must be placed 
at such a distance apart as will allow them room to manoeuvre 
so as to avoid collision with their own friends. The interval 
cannot be less than 800 yds. When the length of the vessels 
themselves is added, it will be seen that a line of twelve vessels 
will stretch six miles. c Modern powder is nominally smokeless, 
and it certainly does not create the dense bank of smoke produced 
by the old explosives. Yet it does create a sufficient haze to 
obscure the view from the van to the rear of an extended line. 
The movements must be rapid, and there will be little time 
indeed in which to take decisions. The torpedo may not be 
used during the actual battle. Its part will be to complete the 
destruction or enforce the surrender of a beaten enemy, and to 
cover retreats. 

The submarine and submergible vessel were brought into 
prominence by France in the hope that by diminishing the 
value of battleships they would reduce the superiority of the 



British navy. The example of France was followed by other 
powers, and particularly by Great Britain; but their value 
as weapons of war is necessarily a matter of speculation. 

Bibliography. — Naval strategy can hardly be said to have been 
dealt with at all till Captain Mahan published his Influence of Sea 
Power on History. The tactics of the ancient world are only very 
briefly dealt with in the De re Militari of Vegctius, in book iv. 
Vegetius was much copied and read in the middle ages, and was 
translated in 1284 by Jean de Meung, one of the authors of the Roman 
de la Rose. His translation is printed, together with the verse 
paraphrase of Priorats, in the Anciens Textes francais. Naval 
tactics are dealt with in the treatise of Leo VI. the Tactician, and 
his son Constantine VII., or perhaps Constantine VIII., printed in 
Mcursius' Opera Omnia, vol. vi. They were emperors of the Mace- 
donian dynasty. The tactics of the medieval galleys are described, 
with references to authorities, both by A. Guglielmotti in Marine 
Pontificia, and by Admiral Jurien de la Graviere in Les Derniers 
jours de la marine d rames (1885). The chief writers on the tactics 
of the sailing fleets were French. At the head of them, in time and 
in merit, must be put Paul Hoste, whose folio on Naval Evolutions 
appeared in 1697. Hoste was a Jesuit who was secretary to the Count 
of Tourville. Hoste's treatise was translated into English and 
published in Edinburgh in 1834 with numerous and excellent illustra- 
tions by Captain J. D. Boswall, A Treatise on Naval Tactics. Captain 
Boswall also made use of the passages relating to naval tactics in the 
History of Ike Art of War by J. G. Hoyer, an officer in the Prussian 
army (1797-1800). Another excellent French treatise is Le 
Manceuvrier of Bourde de Villehuet (1765), translated into English 
in 1788 under the title of The Mamsuvrer, or Skilful Seaman. 
Particular attention is due to the Essay on Naval Tactics by Mr Clerk 
of Eldin, first published in a collected form in 1804, but known in 
parts since 1780. Clerk was original in speculation and lucid in 
exposition. A French treatise, L Art de la guerre sur mer, by the 
Vicomte de Grenier (1787), was less famous or influential, but was 
able and original. An exhaustive collection of " Fighting Instruc- 
tions " and other material necessary to an intelligent understanding 
of the naval tactics of sailing fleets is the Fighting Instructions 1530- 
i8i6 t edited by Mr Julian S. Corbett for the Navy Record Society 
(1905)" Admiral Ekin's Naval Battles (1824) has some passages of 
value. It is comparatively easy to give authorities for the warfare 
of galleys and sailing ships. The case is altered when we have to 
deal with the tactics of steam fleets. Vast quantities of speculation 
have 'been written in every country which possesses a fleet, but, no 
test having been applied on a sufficient scale till the Russo-Japanese 
War of 1904, little of it can be said to possess approved authority. 
The facts 01 such wars as there have been are collected in Captain 
Mahan's Life of Farragut (1893) and Lessons of the War with Spain 
(1899), and in Mr H. W. Wilson's Ironclads in Action, i8$$-i89$. A 
standard work on evolutions and formations is Elementary Naval 
Tactics, by Captain Wm. Bainbridge Hoff of the United States navy, 
first published in 1894, but reprinted since with enlargements. 
The Naval Warfare of Admiral P. H. Colomb is a collection of 
historical examples meant to illustrate the principles of naval 
strategy for application in modern conditions. The third edition, 
revised and corrected, with additions, appeared in 1899. (D. H.) 

NAWAB, a Mahommedan title for a native ruler in India, 
answering to the Hindu raja. Nawab originally means a deputy, 
being the honorific plural of the Arabic naib, and it was applied 
to a delegate of a supreme chief, the viceroy or governor under 
the Great Mogul, e.g. the nawab of Oudh. From this use it 
became a title of rank, without office, and is now sometimes 
conferred by the British government on Mahommedan gentlemen 
for distinguished service. 

NAWABGANJ, the name of three towns of British India. 
(1) The most important is the headquarters of Bara Banki 
district in the United Provinces, on the Oudh and Rohilkhand 
railway, 17 m. E. of Lucknow; pop. (1001) 14,478. It has 
a considerable trade in sugar and cotton goods. It was the 
scene of a victory by Sir Hope Grant during the Mutiny. (2) A 
town in Malda district, Eastern Bengal and Assam, on the 
Mahananda near its junction with the Ganges, a centre of river 
trade; pop. (1901) 17,016. (3) A town in Gonda district, 
United Provinces, on the Bengal and Nortb-Western railway; 
pop. (1901) 7047. 

NAWANAGAR, or Jamnagar, a native state of India, in 
Kathiawar, within the Gujarat division of Bombay, situated 
on the south of the Gulf of Cutch. Area, 3791 sq. m. Pop. 
(1001) 336,779, showing a decrease of 11% in the decade due to 
famine. Estimated revenue, £170,000; tribute, £8000. The 
chief, whose title is Jam, is a Jareja Rajput of the same clan 
as the rao of Cutch. Prince Ranjitsinjhi (b. 1872), well known 
in England as a cricketer, was educated at the Rajkumar College,

Rajkot, and Trinity College, Cambridge. He had been adopted 
by his uncle, the Jam Shri Vibhaji, but the adoption was set 
aside, with British sanction, in favour of a son by a Mahommedan 
mother. This son succeeded, but died in 1906 aged twenty-four, 
and Ranjitsinjhi obtained the throne in March 1907. A branch 
railway, constructed at the expense of the state, was opened 
in 1 898 from Rajkot to Nawanagar town. 

The town of Nawanagar is about 5 m. from the seaport of 
Bedi. Pop. (1901) 53,844. Founded by Jam Rawal in 1540, 
it is built of stone, and has manufactures of silk and gold 
embroidery, and perfumed oils and red powder for ceremonial 
purposes. Its water is supplied from a reservoir covering 600 
acres and an aqueduct 8 m. long. 

NAWiWl [AbC ZakarIyya ibn Sharaf un-Nawawt] (1233- 
1278), Arabian writer, was born at Nawa near Damascus. In 
the latter city he studied from his eighteenth year, and there, 
after making the pilgrimage in 1253, he settled as a private 
scholar until 1267, when he succeeded Abu Shama as professor 
of tradition at the Ashraflyya school. He died at. Nawa from 
overwork. 

His manual of Moslem law according to the Shafi'ite school has been 
edited with French translation by van den Bergh, 2 vols., Batavia 
(1882-1884), and published at Cairo (1888). The Tahdhtb ul-Asma'i 
has been edited as the Biographical Dictionary of Illustrious Men 
chiefly at the Beginning of Islam by F. Wustenfeld (Gottingen, 1842- 
1847). The Taqrtb wa Taistr, an introduction to the study of 
tradition, was published at Cairo, 1890, with Suyutl's commentary. 
It has been in part translated into French by M. Marcais in the 
Journal asiatique, series ix., vols. 16-18 (1900-1901). NawawPs 
collection of the forty (actually forty-two) chief traditions has been 
frequently published with commentaries in Cairo. For other works

1898), pp. 395-397- (G. W. T.) 

NAXOS, the largest of the Cyclades (about 22 m. by 16 m.), 
a fertile island in the Aegean Sea, east of Faros, with which, and 
adjacent smaller islands, it forms an eparchia. In ancient times 
it was also called Dia or Strongyle. It was rich in vines and 
famous for its wine, and a centre of the worship of Bacchus. 
The god found Ariadne asleep on its shore, when she was deserted 
by Theseus. The sculptors of Naxos formed an important 
school of early Greek art; several unfinished colossal statues 
are still to be seen in the quarries, notably one in Apollona Bay, 
to the N.E. of the island. A tyrant Lygdamis ruled Naxos in 
alliance with Peisistratus of Athens during the 6th century B.C. 
In 501 a Persian fleet unsuccessfully attacked it, but in 490 it 
was captured and treated with great severity. Four Naxian 
ships took part in the expedition of Xerxes, but deserted and 
fought on the Greek side at Salamis in 480. Naxos was a member 
of the Delian League (q.v.)\ it revolted in 471, was captured 
by Athens, and remained in her possession till her empire was 
destroyed. In later times the most remarkable event was its 
capture, in a.d. 1207, by the Venetian Marco Sanudo, who 
founded the duchy of Naxos, which flourished till the Turks took 
the island in 1566. Since the War of Independence it has 
belonged to the Greek kingdom. The only ancient remains of 
any importance are those of a temple (Palati), supposed to be 
that of Dionysus, on an island just oil the town. Naxos is still 
rich in fruit trees, and also exports corn, wine and oil, as well 
as emery, its richest and most important mineral product. Pop. 
(1907) 25,185 (province), 2064 (commune). 

NAXOS, the earliest Greek colony in Sicily, was founded by 
Theocles from Chalcis in 735 B.C., on the E. coast, S. of Tauro- 
menium (mod. Taormina), in a low-lying situation just N. of the 
mouth of the river Alcantara, where the castle of Schiso now 
stands. The adoption of the name of Naxos, the island in the 
Aegean Sea, seems to indicate that there were Naxians among 
its founders. Within a few years it became strong enough to 
found Leontini and Catana. Naxos was the warmest ally of 
Athens in the Sicilian expedition. In 403 B.C. it was destroyed 
by Dionysius and handed over to the Sicels, but was never 
rebuilt. Its place was supplied in 358 by Tauromenium. Scanty 
traces of its walls are to be seen, of irregular blocks of lava, 
especially on the south, parallel to the river (E. A. Freeman, 
HisL of Sic. i. 323). Without the city stood the altar of Apollo 



Archegetes, at which all sacred embassies that left Sicily sacrificed 
before their departure (Thuc. vi. 3). 

NAY, or Ney, the long flute of the ancient Egyptians, held 
obliquely and played by directing the breath, as in the pipes 
of the syrinx, across the open end, which had no embouchure 
of any kind. Performers on the nay are represented on many 
of the frescoes which decorated the tombs at Thebes, their 
flutes reaching nearly to the ground while they are in the familiar 
half-kneeling posture. The acoustic principles involved in the 
production of sound are the same as for the flute. The narrow- 
ness of the bore in proportion to the length would facilitate the 
production of harmonics and so give the nay an extended 
compass. Victor Loret 1 has compiled a list of all the real pipes 
of ancient Egypt which have survived, having for the most 
part been preserved in mummy cases. The nay was not restricted 
to ancient Egypt, but has remained in general use in various 
parts of the East until the present day. (K. S.) 

NAYAGARH, a native state in India, in the Orissa division 
of Bengal. Area, 588 sq. m.; pop. (1901) 140,779; revenue, 
£8000. It contains hills rising to 5000 ft.; and exports much 
agricultural produce. In 1894 a revolt of the hill tribe.of Khonds 
against the raja required the intervention of British military 
police. Nayagarh village (pop. 3340) is connected by road with 
Khurda in Puri district. 

NAYAR, or Nair, a caste or tribe on the W. coast of S. India, 
who form the dominant race in Malabar. Traditionally they are 
soldiers, but many have taken to professions, and one was in 
1910 a judge of the high court at Madras. Their total number in 
all India in 1901 was just over one million. Their most peculiar 
customs are: (1) marumakkaltayam—" descent through sister's 
children," or inheritance in the female line; and (2) sambandham, 
a loose form of union, taking the place of marriage, without any 
responsibility of the husband towards either wife or children. 
In 1896 an act of the Madras legislature enabled a sambandham 
to be registered, and have the force of a legal marriage. Little 
advantage has been taken of this act, while it is alleged that 
the sambandham now usually lasts for a lifetime.

NAYLER (or Naylor), JAMES (1618-1660), English Puritan, 
was born at Andersloe or Ardsley, in Yorkshire, in 1618. In 
1642 he joined the parliamentary army, and served as quarter- 
master in John Lambert's horse. In 165 1 he adopted Quakerism, 
and gradually arrived at the conviction that he was a new 
incarnation of Christ. He gathered round him a small band of 
disciples, who followed him from place to place. At Appleby 
in 1653 and again at Exeter in 1655 he suffered terms of imprison- 
ment. In October 1655, in imitation of Christ's procession into 
Jerusalem, he entered Bristol on horseback riding single — " a 
rawboned nude figure, with lank hair reaching below his cheeks " 
— attended by seven followers, some on horseback, some on foot, 
he in silence and they singing "Hosannal Holy, holy! Lord 
God of Sabaoth!" At the High Cross he and his followers 
were arrested. His trial occupied the second parliament of 
Cromwell for several days, and on the 16th of December 1656 
he was convicted of blasphemy and sentenced to be whipped 
from the Palace Yard to the Old Exchange, to be branded in 
the forehead with " B" (for blasphemer), to have his tongue 
bored with a red-hot iron, to be whipped through the streets 
of Bristol, and to suffer imprisonment with hard labour for two 
years. On his release he was readmitted into the communion 
of the Quakers, and spent some time in Westmorland with 
George Whitehead (1636?-! 7 23). In October 1660 Nayler 
set out to visit his long-forsaken family in Yorkshire, but died 
on the journey in Huntingdonshire. 

A collected edition of the Tracts of Nayler appeared in 1716.

Sentence of James Nayler (1657); a Memoir of the Life, Ministry, 
Trial, and Sufferings of James Nayler (1719) ; and a Refutation of

commonly called Quakers, with a Life of James Nayler, by Joseph 
Gurney Bevan (1800).

NAZARENES— NEAGH 



3i9 



NAZARENES (Nafcopacot), an obscure Jewish-Christian sect, 
existing at the time of Epiphanius (fl. a.d. 370) in Coele-Syria, 
Decapolis (Pella) and Basanitis (Cocabe). According to that 
authority {Parianon, xxix. 7) they dated their settlement in 
Pella from the time of the flight of the Jewish Christians 
from Jerusalem, immediately before the siege in a.d. 70; he 
characterizes them as neither more nor less than Jews pure and 
simple, but adds that they recognized the new covenant as well as 
the old, and believed in the resurrection, and in the one God and 
His Son Jesus Christ. He cannot say whether their christologieal 
views were identical with those of Cerinthus and his school, or 
whether they differed at all from his own. But Jerome {Ep. 79, 
to Augustine) says that they believed in Christ the Son of God, 
born of the Virgin Mary, who suffered under Pontius Pilate, and 
rose again, but adds that, " desiring to be both Jews and 
Christians, they are neither the one nor the other." They used 
the Aramaic recension of the Gospel according to Matthew, 
which they called the Gospel to the Hebrews, but, while adhering 
as far as possible to the Mosaic economy as regarded circumcision, 
sabbaths, foods and the like, they did not refuse to recognize the 
apostolieity of Paul or the rights of heathen Christians (Jer., 
Comm. in Isa., ix. 1). These facts, taken along with the name 
(cf. Acts xxiv, 5) and geographical position of the sect, lead 
to the conclusion that the Nazarenes of the 4th century are, in 
spite of Epiphanius's distinction, to be identified with the 
Ebionites (q.v.). 

NAZARETH (mod. en-Ndsira), a town in Galilee, in a hollow 
of the hills on the southern border of the plain of Esdraelon. 
It first appears as a village (John i. 46) in which Joseph and Mary 
lived (Luke i. 26) and to which they returned from Egypt 
(Matt. ii. 23). Here the unrecorded years of Christ's boyhood 
were spent. From the name of the town comes nasdra {i.e. 
" Nazarenes "), the ordinary oriental word for " Christians." 
There was here a synagogue (Matt. xiii. 54) in which Christ 
preached the sermon that led to his rejection by his fellow towns- 
men. The growth of legends and traditional identifications can 
be traced in the writings of the pilgrims who have visited the 
town from Jerome's time till our own. For none of these can 
anything be said, save that it is possible that the village spring 
(called " St Mary's Well ") is the same as that used in the time of 
Christ. A large basilica stood here about a.d. 600: the crusaders 
transferred here the bishopric of Scythopolis. It was taken by 
Saladin in 11 87. In 151 7 it was captured by the Turks. The 
population is now estimated at about 3500 Moslems and 6500 
Christians; there are numerous schools, hospitals, &c, conducted 
by Greeks, Latins and Protestants. Visitors are shown the 
" Church of the Annunciation " with caves (including a fragment 
of a pillar hanging from the ceiling, and said to be miraculously 
supported) which are described as the scene of the annunciation, 
the " workshop of Joseph," the " synagogue," and a stone table, 
said to have been used by Christ. 

NAZARITE, or rather Nazirite, the name given by the 
Hebrews to a peculiar kind of devotee. The characteristic 
marks of a Nazarite were unshorn locks and abstinence from 
wine (Judges xiii. 5; 1 Sam. i. 11; Amos ii, 11 seq.); but full 
regulations for the legal observance of the Nazarite vow are 
given in Num. vi., where every product of the grape-vine is 
forbidden, and the Nazarite is enjoined not to approach a dead 
body, even that of his nearest relative. The law in question is 
in its present form post-exilic, and is plainly directed to the 
regulation of a known usage. It contemplates the assumption 
of the vow for a limited period only, and gives particular details 
as to the atoning ceremonies at the sanctuary by which the vow 
must be recommenced if broken by accidental defilement, and the 
closing sacrifice, at which the Nazarite on the expiry of his vow 
cuts off his hair and burns it on the altar, thus returning to 
ordinary life. Among the later Jews the Nazarite vow, of course, 
corresponded with the legal ordinance, which was further 
developed by the scribes in their usual manner (Mishna, tractate 
Ndzir; cf. 1 Mace. iii. 49; Acts xxi. 23 seq.; Joseph. Anl. xix. 
6. 1, Wars ii. 15. 1). On the other hand, in the earliest historical 
case, that of Samson, and in the similar case of Samuel (who, 



however, is not called a Nazarite), the head remains unshorn 
throughout life, and in these times the ceremonial observances 
as to uncleanness must have been less precise. Samson's mother 
is forbidden to eat unclean things during pregnancy, but Samson 
himself touches the carcass of a lion and is often in contact with 
the slain, nor does he abstain from giving feasts. 1 

In the cases of Samuel and Samson the unshorn locks are a 
mark of consecration to God (Judges xiii. 5) for a particular 
service — in the one case the service of the sanctuary," in the other 
the deliverance of Israel from the Philistines. Since, moreover, 
the Hebrew root n-z~r is only dialectically different from n-d-r y 
" to vow," both corresponding to the same original Semitic root 
(Arab, it-dh-r), it would seem that the peculiar marks of the 
Nazarite are primarily no more than the usual sign that a man is 
under a vow of some kind. To leave the locks unshorn during an 
arduous undertaking in which the divine aid was specially 
implored, and to consecrate the hair after success, was a practice 
among various ancient nations, but the closest parallel to the 
Hebrew custom is found in Arabia. 2 There the vow was generally 
one of war or revenge, and, till it was accomplished, the man who 
vowed left his hair unshorn and unkempt, and abstained from 
wine, women, ointment and perfume. Such is the figure of 
Shanfara as described in his Ldmiya. The observances of the 
ihrdm (period of consecration) belong to the same usage (see 
Mecca), and we find that at Taif it was customary to shear the 
hair at the sanctuary after a journey. The consecration of Samuel 
has also its Arabic parallel in the dedication of an unborn child 
by its mother to the service of the Ka'ba (Ibn Hisham, p. 76; 
Azraki, p. 1 28). The spirit of warlike patriotism that character- 
ized the old religion of Israel could scarcely fail to encourage such 
vows (cf. 2 Sam. xi. 11, and perhaps 1 Sam. xxi. 4 seq.), and from 
the allusion in Amos we are led to suppose that at one time the 
Nazarites had an importance — perhaps even an organization — 
parallel to that of the prophets, but of a very different religious 
type from the Canaanite nature-worship.

NAZARIUS (4th century A.D.), Latin rhetorician and pane- 
gyrist, was, according to Ausonius, a professor of rhetoric at 
Burdigala (Bordeaux). The extant speech of which he is un- 
doubtedly the author (in E. Bahrens, Panegyrici Latini, No. 10) 
was delivered in 321 to celebrate the fifteenth anniversary of the 
accession of Constantiue the Great, and the fifth of his son 
Constantine's admission to the rank of Caesar. The preceding 
speech (No. 9), celebrating the victory of Constantine over 
Maxentius, delivered in 313 at Augusta Trevirorum (Trier), 
has often been attributed to Nazarius, but the difference in style 
and vocabulary, and the more distinctly Christian colouring of 
Nazarius's speech, are against this.

NEAGH, LOUGH, the largest lake (Irish, " lough ") in the 
British Isles, situated in the north-east of Ireland, in the province 
of Ulster, its waters being divided between counties Antrim 
(N. and E.), Down (S.E.), Armagh (S.), Tyrone and Londonderry 
(W.). Its shape is an irregular oblong, its extreme measurements 
being iS m. from N.E. to S.W. 16 from N. to S., and 11 from E. 
to W. Its circumference, without including minor indentations, 
is about 64 m., and its area 98,255 acres or about 153 sq. m. The 
shores are generally flat and marshy, or very gently sloping, but 
flat- topped hills rise near the northern shore, where the lake 
reaches its extreme depth of 102 ft. The mean height above sea- 
level is 48 ft. Though the lough receives a large number of

tradition as to James the Just (Euseb. H.E. ii. 23).

streams, the river Bann alone carries off its waters, flowing 
northward. The principal feeders are the Main on the north, 
the Crumlin (whose waters have petrifying powers) on the east, 
the Bann and Blackwater on the south, and the Ballinderry and 
Moyola on the west. Antrim and Toome, at the N.E. and N.W. 
respectively, are the only towns immediately on the shores. 
The islands are few and near the shores; namely, Skady Tower 
on the north, Ram's Island (with a ruined round tower) on the 
east, Ready and Coney Islands on the southwest. The lough 
abounds in fish, including gillaroo trout, char and pullen or 
fresh-water herring. A tradition that the lough rose suddenly 
from a fountain, inundating a populous district, and that remains 
of buildings may be seen below the waters, finds place in T ^ >mas

NEAL, DANIEL (167S-1743), English historian, born in 
London on the 14th of December 1678, was educated at the 
Merchant Taylors' School, and at the universities of Utrecht 
and Leiden. In 1704 he became assistant minister, and in 1706 
sole minister, of an independent congregation worshipping in 
Aldersgate Street, and afterwards in Jewin Street, London, 
where he remained almost until his death on the 4th of April 
1743. He married Elizabeth Lardner (d. 1748), by whom he had 
one son, Nathanael, and two daughters. In 1720 Neal published 
his History of New England, which obtained for its author the 
honorary degree of M.A. from Harvard college. He 
also undertook to assist Dr John Evans in writing a history of 
Nonconformity. Evans, however, died in 1730, and, making 
use of his papers for the period before 1640, Neal wrote the 
whole of the work himself. This History of the Puritans deals 
with the time between the Reformation and 1689; the first 
volume appearing in 1732, and the fourth and last in 1738. 
The first volume was attacked in 1733 for unfairness and in- 
accuracy by Isaac Maddox, afterwards bishop of St Asaph and 
of Worcester, to whom Neal replied in a pamphlet, A Review of 
the principal facts objected to in the first volume of the History of 
the Puritans; and the remaining volumes hy Zachary Grey 
(1 688-1 766), to whom the author made no reply. 

The History of the Puritans was edited, in five volumes, by Dr 
Joshua Toulmin (1 740-1815), who added a life of Neal in 1797. 
This was reprinted in 1822, and an edition in two volumes was 
published in New York in 1844. 

NEAL, DAVID DALHOFF (1838- ), American artist, was 
born at Lowell, Massachusetts, on the 20th of Octoher 1838. 
He was a pupil of the Royal Academy, Munich, under Max. 
E. Ainmiller, whose daughter he subsequently married. Later 
he entered the studio of Piloty, with whom he remained from 
1869 to 1876. His picture, " The First Meeting of Mary Stuart 
and Rizzio," won for him the great medal of the Royal Bavarian 
Academy of Art. Besides portraits his canvases include " James 
Watt," a large historical composition shown at the Royal 
Academy, 1874, " Chapel of the Kings at Westminster " (collec- 
tion of F. Cutting, Boston) and " Cromwell visiting Milton " 
(Hurlbut collection, Cleveland, Ohio). 

NEALE, EDWARD VANSITTART (1810-1892), English 
co-operator and Christian Socialist, was born at Bath on the 
'2nd of April 1810, the son of a Buckinghamshire clergyman. 
After receiving his earlier education at home he went to Oriel 
College, Oxford. In 1837 he was called to the bar at Lincoln's 
Inn. He became a member of the Christian Socialists in 1850 
and also joined the council of the Society for Promoting Working 
Men's Associations. His wealth enabled him to carry out 
experiments in co-operation on a larger scale than had been 
previously attempted. He founded the first co-operative store 
in London, and advanced the capital for two builders' associations, 
both of which failed. In 1851, though strongly opposed by other 
members of the promoting " Council," he started on his own 
initiative the Central Co-operative Agency, similar in many 
respects to the Co-operative Wholesale Society of a later day. 
The failure of this scheme, together with that of the operatives' 
cause in the engineering lock-out of 1852 is said to have cost him 
£40,000. It is certain that until in later life he inherited the 
estate of Bisham Abbey in Berkshire he was, comparatively 



NEAL, D.— NEANDER, JOACHIM 



speaking, a poor man. He was closely associated with the 
movement which resulted in the Industrial and Provident 
Societies Act of 1876, and the passing of the Consolidation Act of 
1862 was almost entirely due to his efforts. Besides publishing 
pamphlets on co-operation he served on the executive com- 
mittee which afterwards developed into the Central Co-operative 
Board, and took an active part in the formation of the North of 
England Co-operative Wholesale Society in 1863. One of the 
founders of the Cohden mills in 1866, and the Agricultural and 
Horticultural Association in 1867, he also promoted the annual 
co-operative congress, afterwards becoming general secretary 
of the Central Board. He was also a director of the Co-operative 
Insurance Company and a member of the Co-operative News- 
paper Society for many years. He visited America in 1875 with 
a deputation whose object was to open up a direct trade between 
the farmers of the western states and the English co-operative 
stores. After resigning the post of secretary to the congress 
board in 1891, he became a member of the Oxford University 
branch of the Christian Social Union. He died on the 16th of 
September 1892. 

NEALE, JOHN MASON (1818-1866), English divine and 
scholar, was born in London on the 24th of January 1818, and 
was educated at Trinity College, Cambridge. Here he was 
affected by the Oxford movement, and helped to found the 
Camden (afterwards the Ecclesiological) Society. Though he 
took orders in 1841, ill-health prevented his settling in England 
till 1846, when he became warden of Sackville College, an alms- 
house at East Grinstead, an appointment which he held till his 
death on the 6th of August 1866. 

Neale was strongly high-church in his sympathies, and had to 
endure a good deal of opposition, including a fourteen years' 
inhibition by his bishop. In 1855 he founded a nursing sisterhood 
named St Margaret's. He occupies a high place as a hymn- 
ologist, but principally as a translator of ancient and medieval 
hymns, the best known being probably " Brief life is here our 
portion," "To thee, O dear, dear country," and "Jerusalem, 
the golden," which are included in the poem of Bernard of 
Cluny, De Contemptu Mundi, translated by him in full. He also - 
published An Introduction to the History of the Holy Eastern 
Church (1850, 2 vols.); History of the so-called Jansenist Church 
of Holland (1858); Essays on Liturgiology and Church History 
(1863); and many other works.

NEAMTZU (Neamtu), a town in Rumania, situated among 
the lower slopes of the Carpathian Mountains, and on the left 
bank of the river Neamtzu, an affluent of the Moldova. Pop. 
(1900) 8578, about half being Jews. Neamtzu gives its name 
to the Department of which Piatra is the capital. Lying 15 m. 
S. by E. of Falticheni, the nearest railway station, it has little 
trade. Near it is the ruined fortress of Neamtzu, constructed 
early in the 13th century by the Teutonic knights of Andrew U., 
king of Hungary, in order to repel the incursions of the 
Cumanians. An hour's drive to the west of the town is the 
monastery of Neamtzu, founded in the 14th century, and con- 
taining two churches and many ancient and interesting relics. 
Before the secularization of the monastic lands in 1864, it was one 
of the richest and most important of the Rumanian monasteries. 
Baltzatesti, 10 m. W. by S. of Neamtzu, is locally famous for its 
mineral springs and baths. 

NEANDER, JOACHIM (1 650-1680), German hymnwriter, was 
born at Bremen. The family name, originally Neumann, had, 
according to the prevailing fashion a century earlier, been 
Graecized as Neander. After studying at Heidelberg and 
Frankfort, where he formed friendships with Friedrich Spanheim 
(1632-1701) and Philipp Jakob Spener (1635-1705), he settled 
at Diisseldorf as rector of the Latin school in connexion with 
the Reformed Church. In 1676 he incurred church censure 
for abstaining and inducing others to abstain from joining 
in the celebration of the communion. It was during the term of

his suspension from his teaching office that many of his hymns 
were written. He ultimately renounced his connexion with the 
separatists, and in 1679 returned to Bremen as one of the 
preachers of St Martin's church. In the same year he published 
the Bundeslieder and Dankpsalmen, a collection of 71 hymns, 
of which many are still in use. He died on the 31st of May 
1680. The Neanderthal, near Diisseldorf, takes its name from 
him. For his place in hymnology see Hymns. 

See J. F. Iken, Joachim Neander, sein Leben und seine Lieder 
(1880). 

NEANDER, JOHANN AUGUST WILHELM (1789-1850), 
German theologian and church historian, was born at Gottingen 
on the 17th of January 1789. His father, Emmanuel Mendel, 
is said to have been a Jewish pedlar, but August adopted the 
name of Neander on his baptism as a Christian. While still 
very young, he removed with his mother to Hamburg. There, 
as throughout life, the simplicity of his personal appearance 
and the oddity of his manners attracted notice, but still more, 
his great industry and mental power. From the grammar-school 
(Johanneum) he passed to the gymnasium, where the study of 
Plato appears especially to have engrossed him. Considerable 
interest attaches to his early companionship with Wilhelm 
Neumann and certain others, among whom were the writer 
Karl August Varnhagen von Ense and the poet Adelbert von 
Chamisso. 

Baptized on the 25th of February 1806, in the same year 
Neander went to Halle to study divinity. Here Schleiermacher 
was then lecturing. Neander found in him the very impulse which 
he needed, while Schleiermacher found a pupil of thoroughly 
congenial feeling, and one destined to carry out his views in a 
higher and more effective Christian form than he himself was 
capable of imparting to them. But before the year had closed 
the events of the Franco-Prussian War compelled his removal 
to Gottingen. There he continued his studies with ardour, 
made himself yet more master of Plato and Plutarch, and 
became especially advanced in theology under the venerable 
G. J. Planck (l 751-1833). The impulse communicated by 
Schleiermacher was confirmed by Planck, and he seems now 
to have realized that the original investigation of Christian 
history was to form the great work of his life. 

Having finished his university course, he returned to Hamburg, 
and passed his examination for the Christian ministry. After 
an interval of about eighteen months, however, he definitively 
betook himself to an academic career, " habilitating " in 
Heidelberg, where two vacancies had occurred in the theological 
faculty of the university. He entered upon his work here as a 
theological teacher in i3ii; and in 181 2 he became a professor. 
In the same year (1812) he first appeared as an author by the 
publication of his monograph Vber den Kaiser Julianus und sein 
Zeitalter. The fresh insight into the history of the church 
evinced by this work at once drew attention to its author, and 
even before he had terminated the first year of his academical 
labours at Heidelberg, he was called to Berlin, where he was 
appointed professor of theology. 

In the year following his appointment he published a second 
monograph Der Heilige Bemhard und sein Zeitalter (Berlin, 1813) , 
and then in 181S his work on Gnosticism {Genettsche Entwickelung 
der vornehmsten gnostischen Systeme). A still more extended 
an elaborate monograph than either of the preceding followed 
in 1822, Der Heilige Johannes Chrysostomus and die Kirche, 
besonders des Orients in dessen Zeitalter, and again, in 1824, 
another on Tertullian (Antignostikus). He had in the meantime, 
however, begun his great work, to which these several efforts 
were only preparatory studies. The first volume of his 
Allgemcine Geschichte der christlichen Religion und Kirche 
embracing the history of the first three centuries, made its 
appearance in 1825. The others followed at intervals— the 
fifth, which appeared in 1842, bringing down the narrative 
to the pontificate of Boniface VIII. A posthumous volume, 
edited by C. F. T. Schneider in 1852, carried it on to the period 
of the council of Basel. Besides this great work he published 
in 1832 his Geschichte der Pflanzung und Leitung der christlichen 

xix. n 



Kirche, and in 1837 his Das Leben Jesu Christi, in scinem 
geschichtlichen Zusammenhang und seiner geschichtlichen Ent- 
wickelungy called forth by the famous Life of David Strauss. 
In addition to all these he published Denkwiirdigkeiten aus der 
Geschichte des Chiistentums (1823- 1824, 2 vols., 1825, 3 vols., 
1846); Das Eine und Mannichjaltige des christlichen Lebens 
(1840); papers on Plotinus, Thomas Aquinas, Theobald Thamer, 
Blaise Pascal, J. H. Newman, Blanco White and T. Arnold, 
and other occasional pieces (Kleine Gelegenheitsschriften ) x&2g), 
mainly of a practical, exegetical and historical character. He 
died on the '14th of July 1850, worn out and nearly blind with 
inces/^t study. After his death a succession of volumes, 
representing his various courses of lectures, appeared (1856- 
1864), in addition to the Lectures on the History of Dogma (Theo- 
logische Vorlesungen), admirable in spirit and execution, which 
were edited by J. L. Jacobi in 1857. 

Meander's theological position can only be explained in connexion 
with Schleiermacher, and the manner in which while adopting he 
modified and carried out the principles of his master. Character- 
istically meditative, he rested with a secure footing on the great 
central truths of Christianity, and recognized strongly their essential 
reasonableness and harmony. Alive to the claims of criticism, he no 
less strongly asserted the rights of Christian feeling. " Without it," 
he emphatically says, " there can be no theology; it can only thrive 
in the calmness of a soul consecrated to God." This explains his 
favourite motto: " Pectus est quod theologum facit." 

His Church History (Allgemetne Geschichte der christlichen Religion 
und Kirche) remains the greatest monument of his genius. In this 
" Neander's chief aim was everywhere to understand what was 
individual in history. In the principal figures of ecclesiastical 
history he tried to depict the representative tendencies of each age, 
and also the types^ of the essential tendencies of human nature 
generally. His guiding principle in treating both of the history and 
of the present condition of the church was — that Christianity has 
room for the various tendencies of human nature, and aims at per- 
meating and glorifying them all; that according to the divine plan 
these various tendencies are to occur successively and simultaneously 
and to counterbalance each other, so that the freedom and variety 
of the development of the spiritual life ought not to be forced into 
a single dogmatic form " (Otto Pfleiderer, Development of Theology , 
p. 280). Several of his books have passed into new and revised 
editions and have been translated into English. Among these 
English versions may be mentioned General History of the Christian 
Religion and Church, translated by J. Torrev (1850-1858); History 
of the Planting and Training of the Church by the Apostle , by J. E. 
Ryland (1851); Julian and his Generation, by G. V. Cox (1850); 
Life of Jesus, by J. IvTClintock and C. E. Blumenthal (1848); and 
Memorials of Christian Life in the Early and Middle Ages, by J. E. 
Ryland (1852).

NEANDERTHAL, a ravine near the village of Hochdal between 
Diisseldorf and Elberfeld, Rhenish Prussia. Here in 1856 were 
discovered in a Quaternary bed in the Feldhofen Cave human 
remains which have been referred to a type commenly called 
Neanderthal Man. The bones found were a brain-cap, two 
femora, two humeri and other fragments, now in the Fuhlrott 
Collection, Elberfeld. The cranium, pronounced by Huxley to 
be the most ape-like yet discovered, was remarkable for its 
enormous superciliary ridges. Professor Virchow and others 
contended that the remarkable shape was pathological or caused 
by disease during the lifetime of the individual. The subsequent 
discovery of two other skulls, almost identical in form, at Spy 
in Belgium, have helped to prove its typical character. The now 
generally accepted view is that the Neanderthal skull represents 
'the oldest known dolichocephalic race of Europe. 

NEAP, a word only used of tides in which the high-water mark 
is at its lowest, there being the least difference in level between 
high and low water, opposed to " spring tides " (see Tide). 
The word is obscure in origin. It appears in O. Eng. in ntpjldd, 
and only once alone in the expression forthganges nSp, " without 
power of advancing." It may possibly be connected with " nip," 
in the sense of " pinched," " scanty."

NEARCHUS— NEBO 



NEARCHUS, one of the officers in the army of Alexander the 
Great. A native of Crete, he settled at Amphipolis in Macedonia. 
In 325, when Alexander descended the Indus to the sea, he 
ordered Nearchus to conduct the fleet to the head of the Persian 
Gulf. The success with which Nearchus accomplished this 
arduous enterprise led to his selection by Alexander for the more 
difficult task of circumnavigating Arabia from the mouth of the 
Euphrates to the Isthmus of Suez. But this project was cut 
short by the illness and death of the king (323). In the troubles 
that followed Nearchus attached himself to Antigonus, under 
whom he held the government of his old provinces of Lycia and 
Pamphylia, and probably therefore shared in the downfall (301) 
of that monarch. 

He wrote a detailed narrative of his expedition, of which a full 
abstract was embodied by Arrian in his Indica — one of the most 
interesting geographical treatises of antiquity. 

The text, with copious geographical notes, is published in C. 
M Ciller's Geographi Graeci Minores, i. (1856); on the topography see

NEATH (Welsh, Castell-NMd), a municipal and contributory 
parliamentary borough, seaport and market-town of Glamorgan- 
shire, south Wales, prettily situated near the mouth of the 
Neath or Nedd, on the Great Western and the Rhondda and 
Swansea Bay railways, 75 m. E.N.E. of Swansea and 183 J m. 
by rail from London, via Badminton. The Neath and Brecon 
railway has a terminus in the town. Pop. (1901) 13,720. The 
principal buildings are the parish church of St Thomas (restored 
1874), the church of St David (1866), a Roman Catholic 
church, and Baptist, Calvinistic, Methodist, Congregational 
and Wesleyan chapels; the intermediate and technical schools 
(1895), Davies's endowed (elementary) school (1789), the Gwyn 
Hall (1888), the town hall, with corn exchange in the basement 
storey, and the market-house. According to tradition Iestyn- 
ap-Gwrgan, the last prince of Glamorgan, had a residence 
somewhere near the present town, but Fitzhamon, on his con- 
quest of Glamorgan, gave the district between the Neath and 
the Tawe to Richard de Granaville (ancestor of the Granvilles, 
marquesses of Bath), who built on the west banks of the Neath 
first a castle and then in 1 1 29 a Cistercian abbey, to whose monks 
he later gave all his possessions in the district. All traces of 
this castle have disappeared. Another castle, built in the same 
century, on the east bank, was held direct by the lords of 
Glamorgan, as the westernmost outpost of their lordship. It was 
frequently attacked by the Welsh, notably in 1231 when it was 
taken, and the town demolished by Llewelyn ab Iorwerth. The 
portcullis gate and a tower are all that remain of it; of the abbey 
which was at one time the finest in Wales, there still exist the 
external walls, with parts of the chapel, vaulted chapter-house, 
refectory and abbot's house. This abbey was the spot where 
Edward II. found shelter after his escape from Caerphilly. At 
the dissolution the abbey and the manor of Cadoxton (part of 
its possessions) were sold to Sir Richard Williams or Cromwell. 
Its cartulary has been lost. Copper smelting has been carried on 
in or near the town since 1584 when the Mines Royal Society set 
up works at Neath Abbey; the industry attained huge propor- 
tions a century later under Sir Humphrey Mackworth, who from 
1695 carried on copper and lead smelting at Melincrythan. 
Besides its copper works the town at present possesses extensive 
tinplate, steel and galvanized sheet works as well as iron and 
brass foundries, steam-engine factories, brick and tile works, 
engineering works, flannel factories and chemical works. In 
the neighbourhood there are numerous large collieries, and coal 
is shipped from wharves on the riverside, vessels of 300 or 400 
tons being able to reach the quays at high tide. The Neath 
Canal, from the upper part of the Vale of Neath to Briton Ferry 
(13 m.) passes through the town, which is also connected with 
Swansea by another canal. There is a large export trade in coal, 



copper, iron and tin, mostly shipped from nieghbouring ports, 
while the principal imports are timber and general merchandise. 
Neath is included in the Swansea parliamentary district of 
boroughs. 

The town perhaps occupies the site of the ancient Nidus or 
Nidum of the Romans on the Julia Maritima from which a vicinal 
road branched off here for Brecon. No traces of Roman anti- 
quities, however, have been found. Neath is a borough by 
prescription and received its first charter about the middle of 
the 1 2th century from William, earl of Gloucester, who granted 
its burgesses the same customs as those of Cardiff. Other charters 
were granted to it by successive lords of Glamorgan in 1200, 1340, 
l 359i 1 397i I 4 21 an d 1423. By the first of these (1290) the town 
was granted a fair on St Margaret's Day (July 20) and as the 
abbey had extensive sheep walks the trade in wool was consider- 
able. In 1685 James II. granted a charter, which, however, 
was not acted upon except for a short time. 

NEBO, or Nabu (" the proclaimer "), the name of one of the 
chief gods of the Babylonian pantheon, the main seat of whose 
worship was at Borsippa — opposite the city of Babylon. It is 
due to the close association of Borsippa with Babylon after 
the period when Babylon became the centre of the Babylonian 
empire that the cult of Nebo retained a prominence only some 
degrees less than that of Marduk. The amicable relationship 
between the two was expressed by making Nebo the son of 
Marduk. In this case the expression of the relationship in this 
form was intended to symbolize the superiority of Marduk, 
different, therefore, from the view involved in making Marduk 
the son of Ea (q.v.), which meant that the prerogatives of Ea 
were transferred to Marduk by the priests of Babylon. 

Borsippa became in the course of time so completely a mere 
adjunct to Babylon that* one might fairly have expected the 
Nebo cult to have been entirely absorbed by that of Marduk. 
Since that did not happen, the legitimate inference is that 
other deterrent factors were at play. One of these factors was 
the position that Nebo had acquired as the " god of wisdom " 
to whom more particularly the introduction of writing was 
ascribed. He takes his place, therefore, by the side of Ea as 
a cultural deity. The wisdom associated with him had largely 
to do with the interpretation of the movements in the heavens, 
and the priests of Nebo at an early age must have acquired 
widespread fame as astrologers. Assuming now, for which 
there is a reasonable amount of confirmatory evidence, that the 
priestly school of Nebo had acquired a commanding position 
before Babylon rose to political importance we can understand 
why the worshippers of Marduk persisted in paying homage to 
Nebo, and found a means of doing so without lowering the 
dignity and standing of their own god. If Assur-bani-pal, the 
king of Assyria (668-626 B.C.), in the subscripts to the copies 
of Babylonian iiterary tablets invokes as he invariably does 
Nebo and his consort Tashmit as the gods of writing to whom 
all wisdom is traced, it is fair to assume that in so doing he was 
following ancient tradition and that the priests of Marduk 
likewise were dependent upon the school at Borsippa for their 
knowledge and wisdom. 

Nebo is therefore an older god than Marduk in the sense 
that his specific prerogative as the god of wisdom was too firmly 
recognized when Marduk became the head of the Babylonian 
pantheon to be set aside. 

The temple school at Borsippa continued to flourish until 
the end of the neo-Babylonian empire, and school texts of 
various contents, dated in the reigns of Artaxerxes, Cambyses 
and Darius, furnish the evidence that the school survived even 
the conquest of Babylonia by Cyprus (538 B.C.). The original 
character of Nebo can no longer be determined with any degree 
of definiteness. He may have been a solar deity, but there are 
also decided indications which point to his being a water-deity — 
like Ea. It may be, therefore, that if he shows the traits of a 
solar deity, this may be due to the influence of the neighbouring 
Marduk cult, just as in return Marduk takes on attributes that 
belong of right to Nebo. Thus, as the god of writing, Nebo 
has charge of the tables of fate on which he inscribes the names

of men and decides what their lot is to be. If in the systematized 
religious system, Marduk appears as the arbiter of human 
fates, the conclusion is warranted that Marduk is here imbued 
with the authority which originally was in the hands of his son. 
A reconciliation between the rival claims was effected by con- 
tinuing Nebo in the r61e of scribe, but as writing at the dictation 
of the gods, thus recording what the divine assembly, gathered 
in the " chamber of fates " (known as Ubshu Kinakku) within 
the precincts of E-Saggila — Marduk's temple at Babylon — under 
the presidency of Marduk, had decided. 

Nebo also does homage to his father by paying him an annual 
visit during the New Year celebration, when the god was solemnly 
carried across to Babylon, and in return Marduk accompanied 
his son part way back to his shrine at Borsippa. Within E- 
Saggila, Nebo had a sanctuary known, as was his chief temple 
at Borsippa, as E-Zida, " the legitimate (or * firm ') house," and 
the close bond existing between father and son was emphasized 
by providing for Marduk within the precinct of E-Zida, a sanctuary 
which bore the same name, E-Saggila, " the lofty house," as 
Marduk's temple at Babylon. The kings, and more particularly 
those of the neo-Babylonian dynasty, devote themselves assidu- 
ously to the worship and embellishment of both E-Saggila and 
E-Zida. In their inscriptions Marduk and Nebo are invoked 
together and the names of the two temples constantly placed 
side by side. The symbols of the two gods are similarly combined. 
On boundary stones and cylinders, when Marduk's symbol — 
the lance — is depicted, Nebo's symbol — the stylus — is generally 
found adjacent. The dragon, though of right belonging to 
Marduk (q.v.), as the conqueror of Tiamat, also becomes the 
symbol of Nebo, and similarly in other respects the two form 
a close partnership. Such is the relation between the two 
that occasionally, as in the official reports of astrologers and 
in official letters, Nebo is even mentioned before Marduk without 
fear of thereby offending the pride of the priests of Marduk. 

In Assyria the Nebo cult likewise enjoyed great popularity, 
and there is a record of one Assyrian ruler who made Nebo his 
specific deity and called upon his subjects to put their whole trust 
in him. One may discern, indeed, a tendency in Assyria to take 
advantage of the almost equal plane on which Nebo stands 
with Marduk in Babylonia, to play off Nebo as it were against 
Marduk. The Assyrian kings in this way, by glorifying at 
times Nebo at the expense of Marduk, paid their debt of homage 
to the south without any risk of lowering the grade of their 
own chief deity Assur. Marduk was in a measure Assur's rival. 
This was not the case, however, with Nebo, and they accordingly 
showed a desire to regard Nebo rather than Marduk as the 
characteristic representative of the southern pantheon. In the 
astral-theological system Nebo was identified with the planet 
Mercury. His consort, known as Tashmit, plays no independent 
part, and is rarely invoked except in connexion with Nebo.

NEBRASKA, a state just N. of the centre of the U.S.A., lying 
approximately between 40 and 43 N. and between 18 18' W., 
and 2 7 W. from Washington. It is bounded on the N. by South 
Dakota, on the E. by Iowa and a corner of Missouri, on the 
S. by Kansas, on the S. and W. by a corner of Colorado, and 
on the W. by Wyoming. The Missouri river extends along the 
eastern and north-eastern border. The extreme length of the 
state is about 430 m., and extreme breadth about 210 m. The 
area is 77,520 sq. m., of which 712 are water surface. 

Physical Features. — The state lies partly in the physiographic 
province of the Great Plains (covering more than four-fifths of its 
area) and partly in that of the Prairie Plains, and slopes gently from 
the N.W. to the S.E. The altitudes of extreme geographical points 
are as follows: Rulo, in the S.E. corner of the state, 842 ft.; Dakota 
city, in the N.E., 1102; Benkelman, in the S.W in Dundy county, 
2968; Kimball, in the S.W. in Kimball county, 4697; Harrison, in 
the N.W. corner, 4849 ft. There are three physiographic sub- 
divisions; the foot-hills (and Bad Lands), the sand-hills and the 
prairie — all three being portions of three great corresponding regions 
of the Great Plains and Prairie Plains provinces. 

The western portion of the state lies in the foot-hills of the Rocky 
Mountain system, and is much rougher than western Kansas. The 
surface of western Nebraska is characterized by high, barren table- 



lands, broken by canyons, dotted with buttes, and dominated by 
some bold and lofty ridges. Pine Ridge, a picturesque escarpment 
of the Great Plains, cuts across the N.W. corner of Nebraska from 
Wyoming into South Dakota. A ridge of low hills and bluffs, often 
precipitous, marked by buttes and deeply cut in places by canons, it is 
the^ most striking surface feature of the state. The altitude in this 
region varies from 3500 to 5000 ft. In the fork of the North and 
South Platte are the Wild Cat Mountains with contours rising to 
5300 ft., in which Wild Cat Mountain, long reported as the highest 
point in the state, attains 5038 ft., Hogback Mountain 5082 ft., and 
various other hills — Gabe Rock (5006), Big Horn Mountain (4718), 
Coliseum Rock (5050), Scotts Bluff (4662) &c. — rise to heights of 
4500 to 5000 ft. In the extreme N.W. the White river and Hat 
Creek have carved canyons in deep lacustrine deposits, creating 
fantastic cliffs and buttes, bare of vegetation, gashed with drainage 
channels, and baked by the sun. The buttes — bare, pyramidal or 
conical, flat-topped, precipitous hills, and often fantastic, towering 
pinnacles — are rather widely distributed through the foot-hill 
region. They are never more than 600 to 1000 ft. above the sur- 
rounding country. Nature is not grand in any part of Nebraska, 
but the Bad Lands are imposing, and in the wooded foot-hills there 
is an abundance of bold and attractive scenery, particularly in Sioux 
county, and in Cherry county around Valentine and on the canyon oi 
the Snake river. East of the Bad Lands is the sand-hill region, which 
includes an area of possibly 20,000 sq. m. The sand-hills proper are 
scattered over an area of perhaps 15,000 sq. m., between the meridians 
of 98 and 103 W. long., lying mainly N. of the Platte; though there 
are some along the Republican river. In places they rise in tiers, 
one above another, like miniature mountains, and are 200 to 300 ft. 
high; but in general they are very low (25-50 ft. high) and are 
scattered over a plain. Their present contours are wholly the result 
of wind action. Save in rare instances, however, they have long 
ceased to be shifting dunes; for, with the cessation of prairie fires 
and the increase of settlement, they have become well grassed over 
and stable; although sand-draws, and even occasional '* blow-outs" 
scooped by the winds in the summits or sides of the hills are still 
characteristic landmarks. All about and inter-penetrating the foot- 
hill and sand-hill regions are the prairies, which include three-fourths 
of the state. They are sometimes characteristically flat over wide 
areas, but are usually gently rolling. Stream valleys and bottom 
lands are the conspicuous modifying feature of the prairie region; 
but in general, owing to the gentle slope of the streams and the great 
breadth of the plains, erosion has been slight; and indeed the 
streams, overloaded in seasonal^ freshets, are building up their 
valley floors. The water-partings are characteristically level 
uplands, often with shallow depressions, once lakes, and some of them 
still so. The valleys of the greatest streams are huge shallow troughs. 
The valley floor of the North Platte in the foot-hills, the flood-plain 
of an older river, is in places 700 ft or more below the bounding 
tableland, and 10 to 15 m. wide; the present flood-plain being from 
1 to 4 m. in width. Hundreds of small tributaries to the greater 
streams (especially along the Republican and the Logan) complicate 
and beautify the landscape. No farming country is richer in quiet 
and diversified scenic charm than the prairies of the eastern half of 
the state. The Missouri is noteworthy for high bluffs cut by ravines, 
which border it almost continuously on at least one side. In the foot- 
hills there are typical canyons, as along the Platte forks, and in the 
northern edge of the sand-hills Those of the upper Republican are 
the largest, those of the Bad Lands are the most peculiar; and the 
Niobrara tributary system is the most developed. 

Rivers. — The Missouri skirts the eastern border for perhaps 500 m. 
It is not navigated, and save at Sioux City and Omaha serves 
practically no economic purposes, irrigation being unnecessary in the 
counties on which it borders. Its bluffs, cut for the most part in the 
loess but at places in the rock, are frequently from 100 to 200 ft. 
high. At Vermilion, South Dakota, Its alluvial plain, 1131 ft. above 
the sea, is 330 ft. above the mouth of the Nemaha. Thecurrent is 
always rapid and heavily loaded with sediment, 1 and its axis is 
forever shifting. Large areas of soil are thus shifted back and forth 
between Nebraska and the bordering states, to the encouragement 
of border lawlessness and uncertainty of titles; some portions E. of 
the thread and apparently well within Iowa remain under the 
jurisdiction of Nebraska, or vice versa; and Yankton has been 
seriously threatened with a sudden transler from the South Dakota 
to the Nebraska side. The Platte system is also heavily loaded with 
sediment in Nebraska. The North and South forks both rise in 
Colorado; each, especially the latter, has a rapid primary descent, 
and a very gradual fall down the foot-hills of the Great Plains.' 
Across Nebraska it maintains a remarkably straight course and an 
extraordinarily even gradient (about 6 ft. per mile). In the spring 
freshets it is a magnificent stream, but in summer its volume greatly 
shrinks, and it is normally a broad, shallow, sluggish, stream, flowing 
through interlacing channels among the sand-bars it heaps athwart 
its course. The underflow is probably much greater than the summer

8 The North Platte falls 3700 ft. in 510 m., the South. 7?oo ft. in 
427 m., above their junction; the latter falling 2692 ft. iu 30S m.

surface flow in volume. The Loup system is remarkable for the even 
dip of its parallel feeders, which once joined the Platte separately, 
until the latter banked up its deposits across the mouths of their 
more sluggish currents. The Republican and South Platte — the 
former an intermittent stream — suffer in their flow from the drain 
made upon their waters in Colorado for irrigation. The upper course 
of the Niobrara above the Keya Paha is in a narrow gorge. Its 
immediate bluffs and the shores of some of its tributaries, notably 
the Snake, arc modified by canons. This system is also notable 
among Nebraska streams for a number of pretty water-falls. The 
White river, heading on Pine Ridge, falls nooft. in 20 m. Some 
streams wholly dry up in the dry seasons, and in the foot-hills and 
sand-hills there arc a lew that disappear by sinking or evaporation. 

Surface Water, — Swamps and bogs, apart from purely^ temporary 
weather ponds, are confined to a few restricted regions of the 
Missouri river bottoms and the prairies of the S.E. There are some 
cut-offs or oxbow lakes along the Missouri, and many lakelets origin- 
ally such are scattered along the Platte, Elkhorn, Big Blue and other 
rivers. Scores of lakes are scattered about the heads of streams 
rising in the sand-hills, especially in Cherry county. Sope of them 
are fresh and some alkaline. Springs also are numerous in the sand- 
hills, where they form considerable streams. They often flow with 
force and are known locally from this peculiarity as " artesian " 
springs, or sometimes, from this and their large size, as " mound " 
springs. The state fish-hatchery is on springs at South Bend; at 
Long Pine springs of large flow supply the town and railway shops 
with water, and led to the establishment here of Chautauqua grounds. 

Underground Water. — The so-called blowing- wells are peculiar. 
They occur over much of the state, but most frequently S. of the 
Platte, and are evidently sensitive to barometric conditions; alter- 
nately "blowing" or "' sucking " as these vary; so that, in cold 
weather water-pipes may be frozen 100 or more feet below the surface 
of the ground. Atmospheric pressure is probably the principal cause 
of their action ; they arc therefore termed ' weather wells " in 
some localities. Nearly all counties have a practically inexhaustible 
supply of ground water. Well-depths vary from 15 to 20 ft. in the 
stream valleys and from 30 to 35 ft. on the loess prairies to 100-400 ft. 
in the western foot-hill region and isolated prairie areas. Artesian 
water is also available in many parts of the state. At Niobrara, in 
Knox county, a well 656 ft. deep, drilled in 1896, yielded for a time 
2500 gallons per minute at 95-lt) pressure (in 1903 1900 gallons at 
65-lb pressure), and furnishes power for a flour-mill and municipal 
water and electric lighting works; the pressure forces the water 
about 210 ft. above the mouth of the well, i.e. to a height of 1450 ft. 
Another (1430 ft. deep), in the environs of Omaha, supplies a daily 
flow of 1,160,000 gallons under a pressure of 15 lb. In some small 
and exceptional regions the water is very alkaline, and in the counties 
of the south-east it is^ so generally saline that it is difficult, below 
150 ft., to avoid an inflow of salt water. Saline wells at Lincoln 
(2463, 1050 and 570 ft. deep) and at Beatrice (1260 ft.) are notable 
in this regard. 

Geology. — The eastern part of the state is covered with a thick 
mantle of Quaternary (Pleistocene), and the greatest part of the 
western portion with very thick deposits of Miocene and Pliocene 
(Tertiary). To the Pleistocene belong the alluvium, loess and glacial 
drift, and in part the sand-hills. The drift covers the eastern fifth 
of the state. In striking contrast to Iowa, the Nebraska deposit is 
very thin, seldom thicker than 1 or 2 ft. Above the drift there is 
usually a heavy covering of loess or " bluff deposit " (particularly 
typical in the neighbourhood^ Omaha and Council Bluffs). Though 
thin and worn out in places, it averages probably 100 ft., and is often 
as much as 200 ft. in thickness, and runs diagonally across the state 
from the N.E. to the Colorado inset. The opinion that it is of 
aqueous origin (and probably dates from the close of the glacial time) 
has the weight of authority. It was spread by the rivers: some 
evidences of wind action may be attributed to a later period. The 
sand-hills, which overlap the loess N. of the Platte, are probably 
mainly derived from the Arikaree, but probably also in part from the 
early Pleistocene. West of 102 long, there are beds several hundred 
feet thick of late Tertiary sands and clays. The Arikaree (Miocene) 
and Ogallala (Pliocene) formations of the North Loup beds are super- 
ficial over much of the western half of the state, the former to the N., 
the latter to the S. The buttes are characteristically Arikaree or 
Gering formations topping Brule clay. The same is true of at least 
considerable parts of Pine Ridge. In the Bad Lands there arc 
scanty outcrops of the Chadron formation (known also as " Titano- 
therium beds ), the oldest of the Tertiary beds. The thick super- 
ficial coverings over the state make difficult the determination of the 
underlying strata. There are only very scanty^ outcrops except 
along the rivers. No Archcan roclcs are exposed in Nebraska, and 
the sedimentary formations are undisturbed in situ. The Palaeozoic 
era is represented only by the Pennsylvanian series of the Upper 
Carboniferous and a scanty strip of Kansas- Nebraska Permian, and 
is confined to the S.E. counties. But, though small in area, the 
Carboniferous is by far the most important formation as regards 
mineral resources within the state. It is buried probably 2000 or 
3000 ft. in central Nebraska, outcropping again only in the Rocky 
Mountains. Upon it, in the trough thus formed, rest conformably 
the basal strata of the Cretaceous; the Jurassic and Triassic being 
wholly absent (unless in the extreme north-west). The E. limit of 



the Cretaceous extends across the state from N. to S. between 98 ° 
and 99 W. long. Its groups include the Dakota formation, char- 
acterized by a very peculiar rusty sandstone, and the Benton, both 
of which are rather widely accessible and heavy; the Niobrara; the 
Pierre shales, which apparently underlieabout three-quarters of the 
state in a deep and heavy bed; and, in the extreme west, the 
Laramie. There are almost no Cretaceous outcrops except on the 
streams, especially the Niobrara, Republican and Platte rivers — 
and in the Bad Lands. The superficial Miocene and Pliocene 
deposits in the west, above referred to, are underlaid by the White 
river groups of the Oligoccne, whose outcrops of Brule clay and 
Chadron formation also have been mentioned. b The Bad Lands are 
essentially nothing but fresh-water mud excessively weathered and 
eroded. They are often intersected by dikes of chalcedony, formerly 
mistaken for lava. The Bad Lands and the Arikaree are famous 
fossil fields, the latter being the source of the Daemonelix, or " Devil's 
cork-screw," a large spiral fossil, apparently a lacustrine alga. It 
was once generally supposed that the Pliocene epoch in Nebraska 
was distinguished by the activity of geysers; but the so-called 
11 geyseritc " now known commonly and correctly as "natural 
pumice " and " volcanic ash," which is found inthe Oligocene and 
later formations, has no connexion whatever with geysers, but is 
produced by the shattering of volcanic rock. It occurs widely in 
Nebraska and adjoining states. 

Minerals. — Mineral resources are decidedly limited; the total 
value of the mineral output (excluding coal) in 1907 was $1,383,916, 
of which $953,432 was the value of clay products, $324,239 of stone, 
and $54,227 of sand and gravel. The state, however^ is particularly 
rich in good clays, which are probably its greatestmineral resource. 
Calcite of excellent quality is the commonest mineral. Gravel is 
widely obtainable, and sand of the finest quality is available in 
inexhaustible quantities, and is an important article of export. 
Flint (valuable for railway ballast) occurs in immense quantities 
about Wymore and Blue Springs. The underground salt water flow 
promised once to be a resource of value, especially in the vicinity 
of Lincoln, but has proved of little or no value in comparison with 
the great salt-beds of Kansas. A native plaster is^ yielded by the 
Arikaree and Ogallala rocks, but though otherwise of excellent 
qualities it is ruined by slight exposure to the water. A diatomaceous 
earth in central Nebraska, occurring especially in the region of Loup, 
is a good polishing powder, and is used for_ packing steam pipes. 
Limonite in the form of ochre occurs in considerable quantity. Of 
building stones limestones are the most abundant and important, 
the best comes from the Benton beds and when " green " can be 
sawed into blocks. The Dakota formation, though its sand-stones 
are in general coarse or otherwise inferior, yields some of splendid 
ouality. Its clays, which are of all colours, arc the most valuable of 
the state. The finest building stone is a beautiful green quartzite 
rock of dense, fine texture and lasting quality. It is related to the 
Ogallala beds and occurs only in small areas. The quarries and clay 
pits of the state are mainly in the Carboniferous region of the S.E. 
Cretaceous lignite occurs in small quantities in the N.E., and peat 
more widely. The Carboniferous formations carry only thin seams 
of coal, never thicker than about 2 ft., and rarely readily accessible, 
and they can never be of more than small and merely local import- 
ance. 

Flora. — Nebraska lies partly in the arid, or Upper Sonoran, and 
partly in the humid, or Carolinian, area of the Upper Austral life- 
zone; the divisional line being placed by the United States Biological 
Survey at about ioo° W. long. The most marked characteristic cf 
Nebraskan vegetation is its immigrant character, and the state has 
been called " one of the finest illustrations of the commingling of 
contiguous species to be found anywhere in America " (C. E. Bessey). 
Immigrant species have even come from Texas and New Mexico, 
from the Dakotas and the Rockies. From the last-named various 
species have crept two-thirds of the way across the state, one (the 
buffalo berry) wholly covers it, and some have barely crossed into 
the border foot-hills from Wyoming. A very few trees and shrubs, 
and some grasses, arcstrictly endemic to the plains and to Nebraska. 
Four floral regions^ lying in north to south belts across the state, and 
closely corresponding to — though in boundaries by no means coincid- 
ing with — its great topographic divisions are distinguished in the 
regions of the Missouri border, the prairies, sand-hills and foot-hills. 
In 1896 some 3196, and by 1905 fully 3300 species had been listed, 
11 representing every branch and nearly every class of the vegetahle 
kingdom " (C. E. Bessey). There are at least 64 trees and at least 
77 shrubs growing native in the state ; but of their joint number a 
mere half-dozen or so can be classed as strictly endemic. Small 
woods of broad-leaf trees (and red cedars) grow very generally along 
all the water-courses of the state; and coniferous species grow along 
Pine Ridge and the Wild Cat Mountains. In the East, various trees 
are readily grown on the uplands ; in the West the honey-locust, the 
Osage orange and Russian mulberry for windbreaks; the green ash, 
and red cedar are perhaps the most valuable drought resisting 
species. The conifers are spreading naturally. In the sand-hills the 
sand-bar willow of the rivers and the cottonwoo.d growing naturally, 
evidence the good conditions of moisture; and the forestation of 
much of the region is undoubtedly possible. Forest reserves were 
established on the Dismal river in 1902 and millions of seedlings had 
been grown by 1906 for transplantation in Nebraska and other states

of the Great Plains. Arbor Day (the 10th of April) was instituted 
by the Nebraska State Board of Agriculture in 1872 at the instance of 
J. Sterling Morton, later secretary of agriculture of the United 
States (see Ajibor Day). It has been yearly observed by the public 
schools of the state, and no state has done more than Nebraska for 
the forestation of its waste and prairie lands. In such a purely 
agricultural state a large wooded area is not desired. Plums, grapes 
and the dwarf " sand-cherry " (Prunus demissa) oi the sand-hills 
are prominent among many wild fruits. The flora is decidedly rich 
in species as compared with other states, but less so in the number 
of individuals. Grasses are perhaps the most noteworthy vegetable 
forms. Nebraska claims a greater variety of native hay and forage 
species than grow in any other state of the Union. No less than 
200 grasses, at least 154 being wild or commonlycultivated, had been 
listed in 1904. Of the total 200 species 150 (130 indigenous) are valu- 
able for forage, 34 (20 indigenous) are classed economically as weeds, 
10 are non-indigenous cereals and 6 are ornamental. The short 
buffalo-grass was originally everywhere abundant, but it had practi- 
cally disappeared by 1890 from the eastern half of the state, and since 
then has steadily become more restricted in habitat. The native 
prairie grasses have been in considerable part displaced by grasses 
introduced from more humid regions. Weeds are very numerous 
(about 125) ; and some, notably the sand-bur (Solonum rostratum) 
cockle-bur, and tumble-weeds among indigenous, and the Russian 
thistle (Salsola tragus) and purslane among non-indigenous species, 
are agricultural pests. Nothing can surpass in beauty the rank 
grasses and bright flowers that grow on the lowlands and rolling 
uplands of a virgin prairie — now hardly to be found in the state. 
The common sunflower (the most conspicuous weed of the state) 
and allied flowers, which spring up in myriads even in the midst of 
unbroken prairie wherever this is disturbed, line the roads with 
yellow bands from horizon to horizon, enclose the broken fields 
and choke waste places. 

Fauna. — The fauna of the state is not known with the same 
thoroughness and detail as the flora, but it too is varied. This is 
notably true of birds and of insects. Of the latter there are 
probably 12,000 to 15,000 species, including 140 butterflies, at least 
180 grasshoppers, several hundred bees/ &c. The so-called " grass 
hoppers," true locusts, have done great damage at times in Nebraska. 
About a third of all the species known in the United ^States are found 
within the state or close to its borders, and of these, 9 or 10 are so 
common that their increase under conditions favourable to^ their 
development may be a danger ^ Such conditions are found in dry 
years, unfavourable to their chief parasitic enemies, favourable to 
their own breeding, and the cause of their migrations. There were 
locust plagues in 1874, 1876 and 1877. Fungus parasites have been 
used with some, but on the whole rather slight, success, and 
mechanical appliances with perhaps greater success, in combating 
these pests. Birds are more effective. As in the case of plants, 
western, eastern, northern and southern avian species meet in 
Nebraska. In 1905 some 415 to 420 species had been found within 
its borders, and more than half of these were known to nest in the 
state; 120 had been counted in the winter. The lakes of the sand- 
hills are the breeding-place — less so as settlement increases — of 
myriads of water-fowl. Before the advent of the white man Neb- 
raska was full of wild mammals, the buffalo ,. elk, black and white 
tailed deer, antelope, bears, timber wolves, panthers (pumas), lynx, 
otter and mink being common. Almost all that remain are black 
bears, foxes, coyotes (prairie wolves), mink, musk-rats, raccoons and 
prairie dogs (or gophers). Antelope were not uncommon in the west 
and northwest until after 1890. The coyote is still so common even 
in the east as to be a nuisance to the farmer; in 1907 a bounty law 
was in force which provided for the payment of a state bounty of $5, 
on every grey wolf, $1*25 on every coyote and $1 on every lynx 
(wild cat). A few rodents have increased in numbers; the prairie 
dog especially is a pest inthe alfalfa fields of the arid lands (as are 
pocket-gophers at places in the east). 

Climate.— -The climate of Nebraska is typically inland or contin- 
ental; i.e. it is characterized by " winters of considerable severity, 
summers of unusual warmth, rainfall in limited quantities, marked 
and sudden changes of temperature, large seasonal and daily tempera- 
ture ranges, and dry, salubrious atmosphere, with a small percentage 
of cloudiness, and a large percentage of sunshine." 1 The average 
wind velocity for the High Plains of Nebraska and adjoining states 
is about 10 to 12 m. ; 25 m. is not uncommon ; and a velocity of 40 m. 
and over is recorded a half-dozen or more times every year. In 
spring velocities of 15 to 20 m. are common. The average velocity 
of winds for the entire state for 11 years preceding 1906 was 9*8 m. 
per hour. The prevailing^ directions are those common to a large part 
of the western Mississippi valley. The prevailing wind of the year is 
N.W.; but in the spring, the summer and much of the autumn its 
predominance is greatly reduced or overcome by S. and S.W. winds 
blowing from the Gulf of Mexico (but deflected by the rotation of the 
earth). Sometimes these winds blow in the winter — causing the 
curious phenomenon of melting snows oh the coldest days of the 
year; in the summer in seasons of drought, especially in the western 
part of the state, this wind from the Gul f sometimes reaches Nebraska

Session (1890), Climate of Nebraska. 



wrung dry of its moisture and so hot that in a day or two it shrivels 
and ruins the crops in its path. Such calamities are, however, 
uncommon, and the belief that Nebraska is often visited by tornadoes 
is erroneous. 

The normal mean-annual temperature of the state is about 48-7° F, 
and the normals for the six approximately equal weather sections into 
which the state is divided by the National Weather Service are 
respectively about 48 , 50-5°, i8-6°, 50-4°, 47-9° and 46-6° F. This 
illustrates the extraordinary homogeneity of climatic conditions. 
But there is a considerable difference in the averages for different 
months — the normal means of January and July through 30 years 
being 20-9° and 74*6° F., and the means of spring, summer, autumn 
and winter respectively about 48 , 72 , 53 and 23*5° F. Thus there 
is for any particular locality a wide range in absolute temperature 
through the year, which averages for the state probably about 120 
(1897- 1 905). Similarly, the range is large through theday, especially 
in the higher altitudes, where the nights are almost invariably cool 
and refreshing after even the hottest day. The number of continu- 
ous days with a mean temperature above §0° F., averages probably 
about 175 for the state. The actual growing-season between frosts 
is, however, not so great. Temperature is of course lower as one 
moves to the N. and N.W., the initial planting and harvesting of each 
crop progressing wave-like across the state in from one to two weeks. 
Especially in the W. and N.W. there are in some winters occasional 
anti-cyclonic or high-area storms known as blizzards — wind-storms 
preceded or accompanied by snow-fall — which are very severe. 
They continue from one to three days, and are habitually followed 
by very low temperature. They are the cause of great loss to 
the cattle owners. Such storms are, however, rare. In the S.E. 
portion of the state the winters are characteristically mild and open. 
Temperatures below zero are rare for any locality; and the same 
may be said of temperatures above 95 ° in summer. 

The normal mean-annual precipitation for the whole state is about 
23*84 in. in rain and melted snow, the actual yearly fall varying 
through 30 years between 13*30 and 31*65 in. Such rainfall might 
seem inadequate for an agricultural country: moreover, the eastern 
half of the state is pore favoured than the western, which belongs, 
indeed, to the semi-arid Great Plains on which the Reclamation 
Service of the United States Government is active. But aridity is a 
matter of the efficiency rather than of the mere quantity of rainfall, 
and in this regard Nebraska is very fortunately situated. Rain is 
most plenteous in the critical months of the year. Seven-tenths of 
all precipitation falls in the growing season, giving the state, especi- 
ally in the east, a greater amount at this time than many other states 
whose aggregate yearly rainfall is greater; so that Nebraska has an 
abundance for the safest cultivation. Moreover, nine-tenths of the 
rainfall is absorbed by the loess and sandy soils, only one-tenth being 
" run-off." It is a widely spread but unfounded belief in Nebraska 
that the rainfall has been increasing since the settlement of the 
state. That its storage has very greatly increased as cultivation has 
been extended (the prairie sod sheds water like a roof) is true; 
moreover, the spread of scientific principles^ farming has increased 
the advantage derived from the ground-water stored. Efficient 
rainfall has thus been greatly increased. Intermittent streamlets 
may well become perennial, and many are probably, as reported, 
becoming so. It is even conceivable that the settlement of the state 
may affect the seasonal distribution of precipitation; and that an 
advantageous alteration has in fact resulted is believed by many. 

The climate of Nebraska is exceptionally healthy. Its beneficial 
qualities must be attributed to the state's inland situation, its dry 
and pure air, constant winds and splendid drainage, to which its 
even slope and peculiar soil alike contribute. In some people, 
however, nervousness is induced ; and the winds, in particular, often 
have this effect. Autumn is perhaps the finest season ; the fields are 
green into the winter, the air is pure and fresh, though dry and 
warm, and the long season is delightfully mild and beautiful. The 
arid portion, as compared with the eastern portion, of the state has 
alike the advantages and disadvantages of a climate more sharply 
characterized. 

Soil. — Geologically Nebraska is one of the most typical agricultural 
states of the Union; although in the present distribution of industrial 
interests agriculture is by no means so predominant as in some 
southern states. The basis of the soils is sands (coarse, fine or silt) ; 
clay beds, though economically important, are in quantity relatively 
scant. In the eastern half silt, and in the western fine sand, form the 
bulk of the soil. There are five well-defined soil regions correspond- 
ing to the geologic-topographic divisions already indicated of drift 
loess, sand-hills, foot-hills and Bad Lands. The loess is a " salt, fine 
sandy loam with a large percentage of sand or silt, and considerable 
calcareous matter, and usually a small amount of clay." It contains 
considerable humic matter, discolouring rapidly in the air (when 
exposed it is characteristically a bright buff). It is of extraordinary 
fertility, and its great depth (in Lincoln and Dawson counties bluffs 
200 ft. thick are found) is a guarantee of almost inexhaustible re- 
sources.^ The glacial drift is also a useful deposit, coarse ingredients 
in it being of small amount (rare boulders, and some gravel). The 
superficial soil over most of the state, and everywhere in the E. except 
rarely where the loess or drift is bare, is a rich, black vegetable mould, 
1 to 5 ft. thick on the uplands. The sand-hills are not inherently 
infertile; the soil never bakes, is always receptive of moisture,

absorbing water like a sponge and holding it well. There is a great 
amount of fertile valley land, adequately watered. Alfalfa and other 
cultivated grasses are encroaching on the whole region, and even the 
natural arid-land bunch grasses make excellent grazing. The 
" butte " soil of the W. is a fine sandy ?jil, characteristically cal- 
careous, derived from the Arikaree. With it also moisture is a great 
factor in its productivity. The Bad Lands are by no means infertile 
(their name, it should be noted, was originally Mauvaises terres d 
traverser) ; but they are almost destitute of ground water, though 
containing many green " pockets " where surface water can be 
stored. They contain much clay and mails, non-absorbent and 
subject to such excessive wash that vegetation cannot gain a foot- 
hold. In various parts of the west are small tracts of so-called 
11 gumbo " soil; they are due to the Pierre shale, are poorly drained 
and characteristically alkaline. Small alkaline areas also occur about 
lakes in the sand-hills. Where surface water is adequate the regions 
of the Pierre shale make splendid grazing lands; but in general they 
are not very useful for agriculture. Salt lands occur about Salt Creek 
notably around Lincoln. The stream bottoms of alluvium are modi- 
fied by loess and humic deposits, and are of course very fertile; 
but hardly more so than the loess of the uplands. 

Agriculture. — Agriculture is not only the chief industry but is 
also the foundation of the commerce and manufactures of the state. 
In 1900, of the total area 6o-8% was reported as included in farms, 
and 37*5% as actually improved. The rank of the state in the 
Union was 13th in value of farm property, and 10th in value of farm 
products. The farm value was $747,950,057, an increase since 1890 
of 46-1%; while the total product-value was $162,696,386 — an 
increase (partly factitious) of 143*4% * n tne same period. A greater 
part of the state was reported improved in 1890 than in 1900; the 
change was due to the increase of stock-raising in the West. Simi- 
larly, the size of the average farm increased from 156*9 acres in 1880 
to 190-1 in 1890, and 246-1 in 1900, although in eastern Nebraska 
there was a contrary tendency. Under the^ Kincaid law, which 
permits entire sections instead of quarter sections (160 acres) to be 
homesteaded, this movement has been fostered. In the years 1880- 
1900 the number of farms operated by cash tenants rose from 3-1 to 
9-6%; of share tenants from 14-9 to 27-3% of the total. There is 
no appreciable tendency toward management for absentee owners. 
The census of 1900 showed that not less than two-fifths of the total 
net income came from live stock or from hay, grain and forage on 
farms representing together 96% of the farm-value of the state — 
live stock being a trifle more important; dairying was similarly 
predominant for 1*6%, and beet-sugar for o-i %. Other crops were 
unimportant sources of revenue. Sugar-beet culture has developed 
since about 1889; it is localized largely in Lincoln county, near 
North Platte, though beets are raised over a large part (especially the 
western part) of the state. In 1907 about 11,000 acres were planted 
to sugar beets. The principal factory for the slicing of the beets 
is one built at Grand Island, Hall county, in 1890. The dairy 
interest is rapidly growing, but is still exceeded in other states. 
Omaha is a great dairy market. Nebraska ranks very high in the 
production of cattle and hogs. A fourth of all animal products are 
represented by milk, butter and cheese, eggs and poultry; the rest 
by animals killed on the farm or sold for slaughter, most of them 
going to supply the meat-packing industry of South Omaha. Wild, 
salt and prairie grasses make up the bulk of the forage acreage, but 
the cultivated crops — especially millet and Hungarian grasses and 
alfalfa — are more important. Holt county in the Elkhorn valley, 
and Sheridan county in the foot-hills, produce more than half the 
hay-crop of the state. Alfalfa can be grown with more or less success 
in every county of the state, not excepting areas where clay or sand 
form the sub-soil; but on the uplands of the central part of the state 
it is produced with the greatest success and in the greatest quantities. 
In 1908, according to the reports of the state Board of Agriculture, 
the crop of Custer, Dawson and Buffalo counties was about 15% of 
the total crop (1,846,703 tons) of the state. The product was 
quintupled between 1809 and 1905, and between 1905 and 1908 the 
increase was about 40 %. It has been a great aid to western Nebraska 
as to other portions of the Great Plains. Sorghum and kafir corn are 
also excellent, and broom-corn ^ fairly good, as drought-resistant 
crops; the last, which is of lessening importance, is localized in Cass, 
Saunders and Polk counties. * Cereals are by far the most important 
crops, representing in 1899 four-fifths of farmed land and crop 
values. Allowing for variations in " off years," but speaking with 
as much exactness as is possible, Nebraska has established her 
position since about 1900 in the* third, fourth and fifth rank respec- 
tively among the states of the Union, in the^ production of Indian 
corn, wheat and oats. Of these, Indian corn is by far the most im- 
portant, representing normally about two-thirds of the total crop 
value; while wheat and oats each represented in 1906 about one- 
seventh of the total crop, and rye, barley, kafir-corn and buckwheat 
make up the small remainder. Indian corn is grown to some extent 
all over the state, except in the north-west, but the great bulk of the 
crop is produced east of the 99th meridian. It is rarely cut, but is 
left to mature and dry on the stalk in the field. The yearly yield in 
the decade 1895-1904, according to the most conservative state 
statistics, varied from 298,599,638 to 72,445,227 bushels, and the 
average was 178,941,084 bushels, or 190,773,957, omitting the failure 
of 1901 ; the yield per acre being similarly 26*35 o r 2 7*9 bushels 



(12*4 in 1901); 1 in 1906 the crop was 249,782,500 bushels, and 
the average yield per acre 34-1 bushels; in 1907 the crop was 
179,328,000 bushels, and the average yield only 24 bushels per acre. 
According to the report of the state Board of Agriculture, Custerj 
Lancaster and Saunders counties produced the largest amounts 
(each more than 5,000,000 bushels) of Indian corn in 1908. Since 
1900 Nebraska has become one of the foremost winter wheat states, 
second only to Kansas. Little spring wheat is now sown except in 
the northern counties, the state being on the northern edge of the 
winter wheat belt. From 1880 to 1890 the acreage devoted to wheat 
greatly diminished, because the spring variety was not relatively 
remunerative, but the acreage trebled in the next decade as autumn 
planting increased. The winter varieties have the advantages of 
larger yield, earlier ripening and lesser loss from insects, and afford ' 
protection to the soil. The growth of durum (macaroni) wheat is 
also increasing, but is hampered by the uncertainty of market, which 
is for the most part foreign. The wheat crops of the decade 1895- 
1904 averaged 33,208,805 bushels a year; or ranged from a minimum 
of 9-8 to a maximum of 20-9, averaging 15-8 bushels to the acre; 
in 1906 the crop was 52,288,692 bushels, and the average yield 
22 bushels per acre; and in 1907 the crop was 45,911,000 bushels, 
and the average yield 18-1 bushels per acre. In 1908 Clay, Adams 
and Hamilton were the principal wheat-growing counties in the 
state. The corresponding figures for oats were :' average yield for 
the decade, 48,145,185 (range, 28,287,707 in 1901 to 66,810,065 in 
1904); range of yield per acre, 17-9 to 34-0, and average 27-6 
bushels per acre; in 1906 the crop was 72,275,000 bushels and the 
average yield per acre 29.5 bushels; in 1907 the crop was 51,490,000 
bushels, and the average yield 20*4 bushels per acre. In the decade 
1 890-1900 the state did not rise above the 10th rank in the Union; 
after 1900 her rise was rapid. The same is even more markedly true 
of rye; in 1907 the crop was 1,502,000 bushels (from 88,400 acres), a 
yield exceeded in only five states in the country. Apples are raised in 
th% N.E. and S.E. sections of the state, and are much the most im- 
portant fruit grown. Peaches are next in importance, and horti- 
cultural enthusiasts believe that the possibilities ot this crop are very 
great. Other fruits are raised with much success, and in 1904 at 
St Louis the horticultural exhibit of the state led those of all other 
states in the medals received for excellence; but nevertheless its 
relative rank in the Union as a fruit-producing state is still low. 

In a period of 30 years (1869-1898) there were, according to the 
state Board of Agriculture, four seasons whose crops could reasonably 
be classed as failures, three more as " short," one as fair, eighteen as 
good, and four as great. Compared with adjoining states — Iowa, 
Minnesota, South Dakota, Kansas, Missouri — none shows a greater, 
if indeed any shows sc great an average value per acre in the yield 
of Indian corn, wheat, oats, barley and rye; and this despite the 
assumed handicap of the western half of the state. In fact the yield 
of this section relatively to cultivated acreage is normally fully equal 
to that of the eastern section; a result quite consistent with the 
scientifically proven fertility of semi-arid lands. ^ The real handicap 
of the western counties would be shown in comparing aggregate yields 
per given area; for much land is normally inarable. Alfalfa, stock 
raising and dairying, afforestation, " dry-farming " and irrigation are, 
however, proving that the West can maintain prosperity by not 
relying upon ordinary agriculture. Alfalfa is not easily started, 
however, on the uplands of the extreme western part of the state; 
and dry-farming (the Campbell dust-mulch system) has the expensive- 
ness in labour of intensive cultivation. ^ The above-mentioned 
delusion that climate is changing and adapting itself to agriculture, 
thus relieving the farmer of accommodating his methods to the 
climate, has considerably handicapped him in progress. Systematic 
experiments in dry-farming throughout the Great Plains^ were pro- 
vided for on a great scale by Congress in 1906. By attention to crop 
rotation, soil physics and world-wide search for plants adapted to the 
Great Plains (such as the U.S. Department of Agriculture has long 
been conducting), a very great deal can be accomplished — no one 
can say how much ; but certainly the Western must long remain at 
a great disadvantage in comparison with the Eastern portion of the 
state as regards the growth of cereals. 

Irrigation. — Water for the western part of the state is a resource 
of primary importance, and irrigation therewith a fundamental 
problem. Very generally, especially in the butte regions, the country 
lends itsell to the impounding of surface water. The lakes are of 
great importance for the stock ranges of the sand-hills. It is 
commonly believed that of underground water, and generally of 
artesian water, even the driest counties have an abundance. This is 
great exaggeration. Though both in central and western Nebraska 
there are strata that generally yield a considerable flow, the supply is 
usually limited and the expense is great. Up to 1906 dependence 
was mainly upon the streams, which it is estimated might furnish 
3 or 4 million acre-feet — enough to irrigate between 10 and 15% 
o f the arid section— were all the water available, and the lan d

the Board of Agriculture for 1895-1904 is 219,196,000 bushels.

Department of Agriculture.

irrigable. As compared with the streams of Colorado* where irriga- 
tion is much more advanced, the streams of Nebraska have a very 
constant flow; the relative supply-capacities ol the Arkansas and 
Poudre in Colorado, and the Loup and North Platte in Nebraska 
being about as i-ooo, 1-193, 3*347 and £-632 respectively, according 
to the estimates of the state engineer (Nebraska Public Documents 
1 90 1 -1 902, vol. iii. p. 144). An irrigation law was first passed by 
Nebraska in 1895. One of the greatest improvement projects under- 
taken by the national Reclamation Service is one on the North 
Platte, begun in 1903, which contemplates a reservoir in Wyoming of 
sufficient capacity to store all the surplus waters of that stream, 
about 600 m. of canals, and the reclamation of 107,000 acres in 
Nebraska ; it was 74 % completed in 1909. The work of the national 
service began in Nebraska in 1902. Some farmers on the uplands 
between the valleys in western Nebraska irrigate by means of 
wind-mills, and although the underground water is 175 ft. or more 
below the surface one wind -mill often supplies sufficient water to 
irrigate ten acres. The extent of irrigated acreage increased about 
thirteen-f old from 1 889 to 1 899. In the latter year there were 1 701 m. 
of ditch costing about $751.00 per m., irrigating 148,538 acres, 
which yielded crops averaging $6.61 per acre in value. The greatest 
part of the irrigated acreage is in the valley of the North Platte and 
the Upper Platte — probably nine-tenths in iqo6 — in Scotts Bluff, 
Lincoln, Cheyenne, Dawson, Keith and Deuel counties. There is, 
however, a large ditch in Platte county — the farthest E. of any large 
ditch in the country; and though agriculture is normally quite 
" successful " here without irrigation, nevertheless it is more profit- 
able with it. In fact, in 1899 about a quarter of the irrigated acreage 
lay E. of the section classed as arid. 

Manufactures* — The rank of Nebraska among the states of the 
Union in 1900 in population, in value of agricultural products, and in 
value of manufactured products, was respectively twenty-seventh, 
tenth and nineteenth. In the decade 1890-1900 the state increased 
the value of its manufactures somewhat more than half. The per 
capita product-values for agriculture and manufactures in 1000 were 
$153 and $135 (as compared with $6$and $38 in 1890). Only 
2-3% of the population were engaged in manufacturing in 1900. 
Of the total factory product (in 1900, $I30,3<> 2 >453; in !Q05, 
$154,918,220), 84*7 % were urban (ue. were for the three cities which 
in 1900 had a population of at least 8000) in 1900, and 81*7 in 1905; 
the percentage for these cities being 53-3 in 1900 and 43*5 in 1905 for 
South Omaha, 29*2 in 1900 and 34*9 in 1905 for Omaha, and 2*1 in 
1900 and 3-4 in 1905 for Lincoln; Nebraska City, Fremont, Grand 
Island, Beatrice, Hastings, Plattsmouth and Kearney were the only 
other manufacturing centres of any importance. In 1907 there was 
a beet-sugar factory at Grand Island; at Nebraska City there are 
several distinctive industries; at South Omaha very important 
meat-packing houses; and the other cities have interests rather 
extensive or varied than distinctive. As yet manufactures are 
insignificant except in lines immediately dependent upon agriculture, 
the combined output of the packing, flour and grist mill, dairy and 
malt-liquor establishments constituting in 1900 nine-tenths of the 
total state output. Meat-packing is by far the most important 
single interest, South Omaha being the third greatest packing centre 
of the country, employing in 1900 and in 1905 a quarter of all wage- 
earners and yielding nearly one-half the total product-value of the 
state ($71,018,339 in 1900; $69,243,468 in 1905). The malt- 
liquor industry is favoured by the great production of barley in 
Iowa; the value of malt liquors manufactured in 1900 was 
$1,433,501. and in 1905 $1,663,788. Nebraska wheat, like that of 
Kansas, combines for milling the splendid qualities of winter wheat 
with those characteristic of grain grown on the edge of the semi-arid 
West; flour and grist-mill products were valued at $7,794,130 in 
1900 and at $12,190,303 in 1905. The first creamery in Nebraska 
was established in 1881. A creamery at Lincoln is said to be the 
largest in the United States. Many co-operative dairies have per- 
sisted since the early days of farmers* granges. The value of 
cheese, butter and other dairy products was $2,253,893 in 1900 and 
$3,326,110 in 1905. Of manufactures not dependent upon agri- 
culture perhaps the most promising is that of brick and tile products 
(valued at $839,815 in 1900 and at $1,131,913 in 1905), and the 
largest in 1905 was the manufacture and repair of steam railway cars 
(valued at $2,624,461 in 1900 and at $4,394,685 in 1905). 

Communications. — There is no longer any river navigation. There 
were 6,101-5 m - °* railway in the state at the end of 1907; the great 
period of railway building was 1 870-1 890, the mileage in 1870 being 
705, in 1880, 1953, and in 1890, 5407. The eastern half of the state 
is much better covered by railways than the western. Six great east 
and west trunk-lines connecting the Rocky Mountain region and 
Chicago enter the state at Omaha (q.v .), and two others, giving rather 
an outlet southward, enter the same city and serve the eastern part 
of the state. In 1908 all but 5 counties out of 90 had railway outlets. 
A marked tendency toward north and south railway lines is of great 
promise to the state, as outlets towards the Gulf of Mexico are im- 
portant, especially for local freight. Omaha and Lincoln are Federal 
ports of entry for customs. 

Population.— In 1900 the population of the state was 1,066,300 
and in 1910, 1,192,214. In 1900 16-6% were foreign-born, 



and 43-3% natives of other states than Nebraska. The latter 
came mainly from the north-central states. Of the foreigners, 
Germans, Scandinavians and British (including English Canadians) 
made up four-fifths of the total. The most numerous individual 
races were Germans (65,506), Swedes (24,693), Bohemians 
(16,138), Danes (12,531), Irish (11,127), English (9757), Russians 
(8083) and English Canadians (8010). In 1900 three cities 
had a population above 25,000 — Omaha, 102,555; Lincoln, 
40,169; South Omaha, 26,001 — and seven others had a popula- 
tion between 5000 and 8000 — Beatrice, Grand Island, Nebraska 
City, Fremont, Hastings, Kearney and York. The population 
of Nebraska was 28,841 in i860, 122,993 in 1870, 452,402 in 
1880 and 1,062,656 in 1890. The increases of population 
by decades following i860 were 326-5, 267-8, 134*1, 0-3, and 
11*8%. From 1880-1890 the absolute increase was exceeded 
in only four states, and was greater than in any state W. of 
the Mississippi except the enormous state of Texas; from 
1 890-1 900 it was less than in any state of the Union except 
Nevada (whose population decreased). In this decade 35 
counties out of 90 in the state showed a decrease: the shrinkage 
was mainly in the first half of the decade, and was due to the 
cumulative' effects of national hard times, a reaction from 
an extraordinarily inflated land " boom " of the late 'eighties, 
and a remarkable succession of drought years, and consequent 
crop failure in the West. Between- 1885 and 1895 Kansas and 
Colorado went through much the same experience, due to a too 
rapid settlement of their arid areas before the conditions of 
successful agriculture were properly understood. Many homes, 
and even small settlements in Nebraska — though not to the 
same extent as in Colorado and Kansas — were abandoned. 
Urban population (the population in places having 4000 or 
more inhabitants) als6 fell, constituting 25*8% in 1890, and in 
1900 only 20-8% of the total population of the state. In the 
case of some cities that showed a great decrease (e.g. Lincoln 
27*2%, and Omaha 27%) notoriously "padded" censuses 
in 1890 were in part responsible for the bad showing ten years 
later. 

In 1906 there were in the state 345,803 communicants of 
various religious denominations; of these 100,763 were Roman 
Catholics, 64,352 Methodists, '59,485 Lutherans, 23,862 Presby- 
terians, 19,121 Disciples of Christ, 17,939 Baptists and 15,247 
Congregationalists. 

In 1890 there were in the state 2893 untaxed and 3538 
taxed Indians, the latter being citizens; in 1900 there were 
3,322 altogether, all of them taxed; and in 1908 there were 
3720, of whom 1270 were Omaha, 11 16 Santee Sioux, 1060 
Winnebago and 274 Ponca. 

Among the Indians who occupied Nebraska immediately before the 
advent of the whites and thereafter, the only families of much im- 
portance in the state's history were the Caddoan and the Siouan. 
The Caddoan family was represented by the Middle or Pawnee 
Confederacy; the Siouan family by its Dakota, Thegiha, Chiwere 
and Winnebago branches. Included in the Dakota branch were the 
Santee and Teton tribes, the latter comprising the Brule" , Blackfeet 
and Oglala Indians; in the Thegiha branch were the Omaha and 
Ponca tribes; and in the Chiwere branch, the Iowa, Oto and the 
Missouri tribes. Other tribes were of less importance; and tribes of 
other families — with the exception of the Cheyennes and Arapahoes 
of the Algonquian family, wnose permanent hunting grounds em-, 
braced the foot-hill country of the West — were of negligible im- 
portance, being only roamers withinthe borders of the state. The 
Pawnees contested the plains against the Sioux with undying 
enmity. Before the CivU War there were no very general troubles 
between Indians and whites, despite constant frontier difficulties, 
except the^ bloodless "Pawnee War" of 1859-60; but in 1863- 
64 the Indians rose rather generally along the frontier, and many 
settlers were killed. In 1890-01 there was another war — with the 
Sioux — marked by the battle of Wounded Knee, just across the line 
in South Dakota. In dealings with the Indians there have been in 
Nebraska the usual discreditable features of administration. The 
maltreatment of the Poncas, a fine and peaceable tribe, was peculiarly 
and inexcusably harsh. Segregation on reservations was generally 
accomplished in 1 870-1 880. There were in 1900 small reservations 
for Omahas and Winnebagoes in Thurston county and for the Sioux 
in Sheridan county, and an agency for the Santees and Poncas near 
the mouth of the Niobrara; and at Genoa, where the Pawnee agency 
and reservation had been located, there was in 1908 an Indian school 
maintained by the United States government with 350 boarding

Eupils. In 1908, however, almost all the tribal lands had been distri- 
uted in severalty: the Niobrara Reservation (under the Santee 
government boarding school for the Santee Sioux andthe Ponca) had 
only 1130-7 acres reserved for agency, school and mission purposes; 
the Ponca Reservation (under the same school) had only 160 acres 
reserved for agency and school buildings; the Omaha Reservation 
(under the Omaha School) had 12,421 acres unallotted; the Sioux 
Reservation (under the Pine Ridge Agency) for Oglala Sioux had 
640 acres; and the Winnebago Reservation (under the Winnebago 
School) had 1710-8 acres unallotted and 480 reserved for agency, &c. 
Government. — The present constitution, adopted in 1875, 
replaced one adopted in 1866. In 1871 a convention framed 
a constitution that was rejected by the people. It provided 
for compulsory education, and for the taxation of church 
property; prohibited the grant by counties or cities of financial 
aid to railway or other corporations, and enjoined that railways 
should have an easement only in their right of way. The last 
two provisions were mainly responsible for the defeat of the 
constitution. The instrument of 1875 presents a few variations 
from the normal type, and under it a few interesting problems 
have arisen. The constitution provides two methods for amend- 
ment. A convention for revising or amending the constitution 
is to be held in case a recommendation to that effect made by the 
legislature (a three-fifths vote of all the members of each house 
being required) is accepted by a majority of the electors voting 
at the next election for members of the legislature, but no 
amendment agreed upon by the convention is to take effect until 
approved by a majority of electors voting on it. Without 
calling a convention, however, the legislature may, by a three- 
fifths vote of all the members of each house, adopt an amendment, 
which is to come into effect only if approved by a majority 
of electors voting at the next election of senators and repre- 
sentatives — the publication of the proposed amendment in some 
newspaper in each county once a week for three months before 
the election being required. This has been interpreted by the 
courts as requiring a majority of the votes actually cast for 
senators and representatives. As there is less interest in amend- 
ments than in the election of members of the legislature, only 
two out of a large number of amendments proposed from time 
to time by three-fifths of the members elected to each house 
have been adopted. The first of these, increasing the pay per 
day to the members of the legislature and providing for longer 
sessions, 1 was declared lost by the official canvassers, but when 
(1886) the ballots had been recounted by the legislature it was 
declared adopted. The second (1906), creating a railway com- 
mission, was endorsed by a political party in state convention, 
was printed on the same ballot-paper with the names of the 
party candidates for office in order to secure for it all " straight " 
party votes, and by this procedure, which was upheld by the 
state supreme court in 1907, it was adopted. All male persons 
who are citizens of the United States or have declared their 
intention to become such at least thirty days before an election 
have the right of suffrage provided they have attained the age 
of twenty-one years, have resided in the state six months, are 
not of unsound mind, and have not been convicted of treason 
or felony. Women who have either children or taxable property 
may vote on questions relating to schools. The general election 
of state and local officers is held annually on the first Tuesday 
succeeding the first Monday in November, but municipal and 
school district elections may be held at other times. The secret 
ballot was adopted in 1891; the use of the voting machines 
was authorized in 1899; and the nomination of candidates 
by primaries was made mandatory in 1907. By a provision 
unique in 1875, the constitution authorized tbe legislature 
to provide that the electors might express their preferences 
for United States senators; but this was not treated as mandatory 
on the legislature, and though votes were at times taken (1886, 
1894), they were not officially canvassed, nor were any senatorial 

1 The amendment increased the pay of members from three dollars 
to five dollars a day " during their sitting," and provided that sessions 
should last at least sixty days, and that members should not receive 
pay " for more than sixty days at any one sitting "; the original 
constitution had provided that they should " not receive pay for 
more than forty days at any one session " and had prescribed no 
minimum length for a session. 






elections materially affected by them. In 1907, under a direct 
primary law, the nomination of candidates for United States 
senator was transferred from the party convention directly 
to the people; and in 1909 the " Oregon plan " was adopted, 
whereby each candidate for the legislature must go on record 
as promising, or not, always to vote for the people's choice 
for United States senator; on the ballot which bears the name 
of each candidate for the legislature there appears a statement 
that he " promises," or that he " will not promise," to vote 
for the " people's choice." In the same year the state 
enacted a law providing for the non-partisan nomination of all 
judges, of all superintendents of public instruction and of 
regents of the state university; nominations are by petition, 
and there is a separate " official non-partisan ballot " bearing 
the names and addresses of the nominees and the titles of the 
office for which they are nominated. The legislature of 1909 
also provided for open election primaries and for the framing 
of state party platforms by convention before the time of the 
primary. 

The governor is the chief executive officer of the state, but quite 
independent of him are a lieutenant-governor, a secretary of state, 
an auditor of public accounts, a treasurer, a superintendent of public 
instruction, an attorney-general and a commissioner of public lands 
and buildings, who, as well as the governor, are elected for a term of 
two years. The governor's appointing power is almost entirely 
limited to officers of state institutions, and for every appointment 
he makes the approval of the Senate is required; but he need not 
ask the consent of that body to remove for incompetency, neglect of 
duty or malfeasance in office " any officer whom he may appoint." 
His constitutional power to pardon is regulated by an act of the 
legislature (i9°7) which requires that he shall in no instance grant a 
pardon until the attorney-general shall have investigated the case and 
conducted a public hearing. _ His veto power extends to items in 
appropriation bills, but any bill or item may be passed over his veto 
by three-fifths of the members elected to each house of the legis- 
lature. The most important board of which he is chairman is the 
state board of equalization. As the present constitution was adopted 
in the year after a grasshopper plague, which had 'caused great 
financial loss, it limited the salary of the governor, auditor of public 
accounts and treasurer, as well as that of the judges of the supreme 
and district courts, to $2500 each and that of other important 
officers (including the secretary of state, the attorney-general and 
the superintendent of public instruction) to $2000. This economy 
has somewhat hampered the growing state. Salaries have been too 
low to attract the ablest men; and as the constitution forbade the 
creation of new offices, and no amendment of this clause could be 
secured, resort was had to the creation of additional " secretaries " 
and of boards constituted of existing state officials or their secretaries. 

The legislature consists of a Senate of 33 members and a House of 
Representatives of 100 members, and meets in regular session on the 
first Tuesday in January of every odd-numbered year at Lincoln, the 
capital. Both^ senators and representatives are apportioned accord- 
ing to population, and are elected by districts in November of each 
even-numbered year for a term of two years. They are paid at the 
rate of five dollars a day during 60 days of a regular session and not 
exceeding ioodays during their entire term. No bill or ioint resolu- 
tion may be introduced at a regular session after its fortieth day 
except at the request of the governor. Special legislation of various 
kinds is expressly prohibited, and in the bill of rights it Is declared 
that " all powers not herein delegated remain with the people." 
This clause would seem to leave the state government with no powers 
not expressly granted, and to make the rule for interpreting the 
Nebraska constitution similar to that for interpreting the Federal 
constitution; but in their practice the Nebraska courts have been 
little influenced by it, and it is chiefly of historical interest.* 

The administration of justice is vested in a supreme court, 15 
district courts, county courts and courts of justices of the peace and 
police magistrates. The supreme court consists of three judges 
elected for a term of six years, one retiring every two years; each 
district court consists of one to seven judges elected for a term of four 
years, and each county court consists of one judge elected for a term 
of two years. The county courts have exclusive original jurisdiction 
in the probate^ of wills and the administration of estates, concurrent 
jurisdiction with the district courts in civil suits for sums not ex- 
ceeding $1000, and important jurisdiction in criminal cases. Perhaps 
the most unique provision of the Nebraska constitution is that 

5 An almost identical clause was inserted in the Ohio constitution 
of 1802, and one in exactly the same language appears in the present 
(1851) constitution of that state; it appears also in the Kansas 
constitutions of 1855, 1858 and 1859 (present), in the Nebraska 
constitution of 1866, in the North Carolina and South Carolina 
constitutions of 1868, and was retained in the present constitution of 
North Carolina as amended in 1876.

relating to appeals; it appears in the bill of rights and reads as 
follows: " The right to be heard in all civil cases in the court of last 
resort, by appeal, error or otherwise, shall not be denied." Regard- 
less of this provision, however, the civil code denies the right of an 
appeal from an inferior court in cases that have been tried by a jury, 
and in which the amount claimed does not exceed $20, and the courts 
have decided that this denial is not in conflict with the constitution ; 
but in at least one instance an appeal was allowed because of the 
constitutional guaranty, and that guaranty has doubtless had much 
influence on judicial legislation. 

County government exists under both the district-commissioner 
system and the township supervisor system, the latter being rare. 
Cities are governed in classes according to population. 

Except in Omaha there is no great field for social economic legis- 
lation; bat the record of the state has been normally good in this 
respect. Railways have given rise to the most notable laws. Regu- 
lation has been a burning political question since 1876, the constitu- 
tion making it the duty^ of the legislature to " correct abuses and 
prevent unjust discriminations and extortions in all charges of 
express, telegraph and railroad companies " within the state. The 
influence of the railways has been very great, and a constant drag 
on just taxation and other legislative reforms. In 1885, 1887 and 
1897 the legislature created a Board of Transportation consisting of 
existing state executive officers or their secretaries, but this could do 
little except gather statistics, investigate alleged abuses, and advise 
the legislature, upon which the regulation of rates remained man- 
datory by the constitution. The Board was eventually declared 
unconstitutional by the state supreme court. In 1893 a maximum 
freight-rate Act was passed, but the rates thus fixed were declared 
by the United States Supreme Court to conflict with the Fourteenth 
Amendment, being " unreasonable." The right of the state to fix 
" reasonable " rates remained unquestioned, but American ex- 
perience has not found such laws efficacious. In 1006 all political 
parties conducted campaigns on promises of radical legislation on 
railway rates, passenger and freight; and a constitutional amend- 
ment creating a railway commission was adopted in the manner 
above described. A result of this campaign was a remarkable series 
of enactments in 1907 for the regulation of railways. The legislature 
framed a stringent anti-pass law, reduced passenger fares and express 
and freight charges, provided for equitable local taxation of railway 
terminals, regulated railway labour in the interest of safe travel, fixed 
upon railways the responsibility for the death or injury of their 
employes, and gave to the newly-created railway commission 
complete jurisdiction over all steam-railways in the state, over the 
street railways of the cities, and over express companies, telegraph 
companies, telephone companies and all other common carriers. 
In 1909 provision was made for an annual corporation licence tax 
and for the physical valuation of railways. In the same year, 
following the example of Oklahoma, Nebraska passed a law 
guaranteeing bank deposits from a fund created by an assessment on 
the basis of total deposits. Useful child-labour and pure-food laws 
were enacted in 1907. Prohibition of the liquor traffic had been 
established in the Territory in 1855, but liquor licences were intro- 
duced in 1858; in 1909 the licence fee was fixed at $1000. A law 
enacted in 1907 made it illegal for breweries to own retail liquor 
houses, and one of 1900 required all saloons to close from 8 p.m. to 
7 a.m. A homestead law exempts from judgment liens and forced 
sale a homestead not exceeding $2000 in value and consisting either 
of a farm not exceeding 160 acres or of property not exceeding two 
lots in a city or village; the exemption, however, does not extend to 
mechanics', labourers' or vendors liens upon said homestead or to a 
mortgage upon it that has been signed by both husband and wife or 
by an unmarried claimant. A woman's rights to her property are not 
affected by marriage, except that it becomes liable for payment of 
debts contracted for necessaries to the family when a judgment 
against the husband for the payment of the same cannot be satisfied. 
The rights of dower and courtesy have been abolished, and husband 
and wife have instead equal rights to inherit property from the 
other; but the portion of the property of a deceased spouse that 
descends to the survivor varies from one-fourth to all according to 
whose and how many are the children concerned; The grounds for a 
divorce are adultery, incompetency at the time of marriage, sentence 
to imprisonment for a term of three years or more, abandonment 
without just cause for two years, habitual drunkenness, extreme 
cruelty, and refusal or neglect of the husband to provide a suitable 
maintenance for his wife. The period of residence in the state re- 
quired to secure a divorce was formerly six months, but in 1909 it 
was made two years. 

Finance. — The constitution limited the debt that the state might 
contract to meet casual deficits to $100,000, unless in time of war, 
and required taxes to be laid to maintain interest on such debt 
(bonds). These provisions were construed to mean that not more 
than $100,000 of debt could be contracted in addition to appropria- 
tions made by the legislature. There was from the beginning a 
constant issue of state " warrants " on the general fund, dependent on 
taxation. These warrants when issued and presented for payment 
were paid by the state treasurer, were sold to the permanent school 
J""" .and drew 4% interest until cancelled from the general fund. 
The floating debt of warrants was practically cancelled in 1909, after 
a one-mill levy for four years for this purpose. Since 1900 there has 



been no bonded debt whatever. The constitution also prohibited 
state aid to railways and other corporations, leaving this to cities 
and counties under limitations. In 1903 the assessed valuation of 
property was $188,458,379; in 1905, $504,470,961; in 1906, 
$313,060,301; in 1907, $328,757,578, and in 1908, $39^529,673. 
The increase was due largely to a new revenue law of 1903 ordering 
property to be assessed at one-fifth of its actual value. The average 
tax-rate in the year 1904 was 6§ mills; in 1905, 1906 and 1907, 7 
mills; and in 1908, 6i mills. 

Education. — The public schools have been endowed by the United 
States, beginning in 1854, and by the state ; in 1909 the permanent 
school funds derived from the sale of educational lands amounted to 
$8,450,557, invested in state securities, county, school district and 
municipal bonds. The percentage of illiterate population (i.e. popu- 
lation unable to write) above 10 years of age was in 1880 and 1890 
smaller than that in any other state in the Union, and in 1900, when 
it was 2*3% (for native whites, foreign whites and negroes re- 
spectively o*8, 6-8 and 1 1 *8), was smaller than that in any other state 
except Iowa (whose percentage was also 2*3); the percentage for 
males of voting age (2-5 %) being the least in the Union. There are 
four state normal schools — one at Peru (opened 1867), one at 
Kearney (1905), one at Wayne (originally private; purchased by the 
state in 1900) and one, provided for by the legislature of 1909, 
situated in the north-western part of the state. The university of 
Nebraska at Lincoln was established in 1869 by an act of the state 
legislature, and was opened in 1871. The university is governed by 
a board of six regents, elected by the electors of the state at large, 
each for six years, two going out of office each year. The revenue of 
the university is from the income of Congressional land grants under 
the Morrill Acts and from a one mill per one dollar tax on the current 
assessment roll of the state. 1 Connected with it and governed by 
the same regents are the State College of Agriculture (including the 
School of Agriculture) and the Agricultural Experiment Station, 
on the university farm of 320 acres, 2J m. E. of the university, 
which receive support from the United States government, and an 
experimental sub-station at North Platte. The botanical and 
geological surveys of the state are carried on Jby the university; the 
former has been largely under the supervision of Charles Edwin 
Bessey (b. 1845), professor of botany. The university as reorganized 
in 1909 embraces a college of arts and sciences, a graduate college, 
a college cf agriculture, a college of engineering, a teachers' college 
(1908), a college of law (1891), a college of medicine, a school of 
pharmacy, a school of fine arts, an affiliated school of music and a 
summer session. The medical school is in Omaha. The university 
has no preparatory department. Its^ library in 1909 had about 
85,000 volumes. In 1908-1909 the university had an enrolment of 
361 1 students (2077 men and 1534 women). ^ The granting of uni- 
versity degrees is conditioned by a "credit-hour" system; 125 
credit hours are required for a bachelor's degree. Elisha Benjamin 
Andrews 2 (b. 1844) became chancellor of the university in 1900; 
in 1909 he was succeeded by Samuel Avery fb. 1865). Most of the 
educational institutions of the state are coeducational. Among the 
private educational institutions of the state are: Nebraska Wesleyan 
University (1888, Methodist Episcopal), at University Place, a* 
suburb of Lincoln; Union College (1891, Adventist), at College View, 
suburb of Lincoln; Creighton University (1879, Roman Catholic), 
at Omaha; York College (1890, United Baptist), at York; Cotner 
University (1889; legally "The Nebraska Christian University")," 
at Bethany, a suburb of Lincoln; Grand Island College (1892, 
Baptist), at Grand Island; Doane College (1872, Congregational), at 
Crete; Hastings College (1882, Presbyterian), at Hastings; and 
Bellevue College (1883, Presbyterian), at Bcllevue. State penal and 
charitable institutions include soldiers' and sailors' homes at Grand 
Island and Milford, an Institute for the Blind at Nebraska City 
(1875), an Institute for the Deaf and Dumb at Omaha (1867), an 
Institute for Feeble Minded Youth at Beatrice (1885), an Industrial 
School for Juvenile Delinquents (boys) at Kearney (1879), a Girls* 
Industrial School at Geneva (1881), an Industrial Home at Milford 
(1887) for unfortunate and homeless girls guilty of a first offence, 
asylums or hospitals for the insane at Lincoln (1869), Norfolk (1886) 
and Hastings (1887), an Orthopedic Hospital (1905) for crippled, 
ruptured and deformed children and a state penitentiary (1867), 
both at Lincoln. A Home for the Friendless, at Lincoln, incor- 
porated in 1876, was taken over by the^ state in 1897; admission 
was restricted to children, and in 1909 its name was changed to 
the State Public School. 

1 In 1909 the state legislature refused to accept for the university 
the Carnegie education pensions.

History. — Local pride has prompted some Nebraskans to 
begin the history of the white race in their state with the march 
of Coronado, in 1541, across the buffalo plains to " Quivira," 
N. of the Arkansas river in Kansas; but the claim is not warranted 
by the evidence. Marquette mapped the Platte from hearsay 
in 1673; French explorers followed it to the Forks in 1739; 
and, after Nebraska passed to the United States in 1803 as part 
of the Louisiana Purchase, successive American exploring 
expeditions left traces in its history. Major Stephen H.Long, 
in particular, followed the Platte and South Platte across the 
state in 1 81 9, and his despairing account of the semi-arid buffalo 
plains — whence arose the myth of the Great American Desert — 
finely contrasts with the later history and latter-day optimism 
of dry-farming and irrigation. Meanwhile, fur traders who drew 
their goods from the country of the Platte had long been active 
on the Missouri. Trading posts were probably established in 
Nebraska in 1795, 1802, 1807 and 181 2; the last two near 
the present towns of Ft. Calhoun (about 20 m. N. by W. from 
Omaha) and Bellevue. Manuel de Lisa, a noted Cuban trader 
and plainsman, was probably the first white settler (1807). 
In 1823 Bellevue became an Indian agency, and in 1849 the 
first United States post-office in Nebraska. Ft. Atkinson was 
maintained near the present town of Ft. Calhoun in 1 810-182 7; 
in 1825 the government acquired the first Indian lands, and 
in the 'thirties of the 19th century missionaries began to settle 
among the tribes; the first Ft. Kearney was maintained where 
Nebraska City now stands in 1847-1848, and in the latter year 
was re-established on the Platte, some 175 m. inland from the 
Missouri. Meanwhile there had begun the passage of the Mormons 
across the state (1845-185 7), marked by important temporary 
settlements near Omaha (q.v.) and elsewhere, the travel to Oregon, 
and to California, for which dep6ts of supplies were established 
at Bellevue, Plattsmouth, Nebraska City and old Ft. Kearney, 
or Dobey Town. 1 Thus the country was well and favourably 
known before Congress organized it as a Territory in 1854. 

Movements in Congress for the creation of a new Territory 
on the Platte began in 1844, several attempts at organization 
failing in the succeeding decade. In 1852-1853 Iowans and 
Missourians along the border of what are now Kansas and 
Nebraska held elections W. of the Missouri and sent delegates 
to Congress. A provisional Territorial government formed 
by Wyandot Indians and b'censed white residents on Indian 
lands in Kansas (q.v.) forced Congress to take action. With 
what followed, the rivalry of the Platte and Kansas river valleys 
for the Pacific railway route, and the opposing interests of 
pro-slavery Missouri and anti-slavery Iowa, and possibly the 
personal ambitions of Stephen A. Douglas and Thomas H. 
Benton, had important relations. In the outcome Nebraska 
was one of the two Territories created by the Kansas-Nebraska 
Bill of 1854. This creative act bore evident traces of the pro- 
slavery sentiments of the Congress that passed it in the limitation 
of the suffrage to whites, and the explicit application of the 
national fugitive-slave laws for the last time in a federal statute. 
Under the provision of " popular-sovereignty " it was thought 
that Nebraska, as the more northerly Territory, would become 
a " free " state, if not a free Territory. There were slaves 
within its borders from the beginning, and anti-slavery ideas 
were embodied in several legislative bills, until a teiritorial 
law of 1 86 1 excluded slavery. But the future of slavery was 
settled in Kansas, and events in Nebraska throw only a small 
side-light on that struggle. John Brown and James H. Lane 
spent considerable time in the south-eastern counties, and 
across these an " underground railroad " ran, by which slaves 
were conducted from Kansas to Iowa and freedom. 

As organized in 1854 Nebraska extended from 40 N. lat. 
to British America, and from the Missouri and White Earth 
rivers to the " summit " of the Rockies; but in 1861 and 1863 
it was reduced, by the creation of other Territories, to its present 
"boundaries. By i860 settlement had spread 150 m. W. from 

1 In 18 months of 1849-1850 it was officially reported that 8000 
wagons, with 8o ( ooo draught-animals and 30,000 people, passed 
Ft. Kearney on the way to Oregon, California or Utah. 



the Missouri, following the river valleys and the freighting 
routes. Many who had migrated to Pike's Peak in 1859, stopped 
in Nebraska on their return eastward; and settlement was 
stimulated by the national Homestead Act of 1862 (one of the 
first patents granted thereunder, on the 1st of January 1863, 
was for a claim near Beatrice, Nebraska), and by the building 
and land-sales of the Union Pacific and Burlington railways 
following 1863. Thus in 1861 there were probably 30,000 
inhabitants in the Territory, and 3300 men were sent into the 
field for the Union army in the Civil War. Until well into the 
'sixties freighting across the plains was a great business. The 
"Oregon Trail," the "Old California Trail," and the "Old Salt 
Lake Trail " — all nearly identical in Nebraska — ran along the 
Platte across the entire state with various terminal branches 
near the eastern border, to the Missouri river towns; while' 
branches from St Joseph, Missouri and Leavenworth, Kansas, 
ran up the valleys of the Big Blue and Little Blue rivers and 
joined the Nebraska roads near Ft. Kearney. The Oregon and 
California migration was of large magnitude by 1846. St Joseph, 
Leavenworth and Nebraska City (q.v.) were the great freighting 
terminals of the West. Over these roads was run in 1860-1861 
the famous " pony express " whose service ended with the cont- 
pletion of the overland telegraph in the latter year; it covered 
the distance from St Joseph, Missouri, to Sacramento, California, 
in eight days, and even less. Freighting ended when the Union 
Pacific was extended across Nebraska between 1863 and 1867. 

Political interest in the Territorial period centred mainly 
in a fight for the capital, waged between the towns of the 
Missouri river front, Bellevue, Brownville, Nebraska City, 
Plattsmouth, Omaha and Florence, those of the North Platte 
interior, and of the South Platte. This struggle engendered 
extraordinary bitterness, since success might mean continued 
life, and defeat prompt demise, to competing towns. As popula- 
tion increased the question of the capital was complicated by 
the question of statehood. Both were involved in the agitation 
in 1 858-1 859 for the annexation of the South Platte to Kansas 
(q.v.) t which gained considerable strength; annexation promising 
to the former much earlier statehood than continued union 
with the backward region of the North Platte, and to northern 
Kansas also promising earlier statehood, and an advantage 
in the sectional struggle with southern Kansas. As the expenses 
of Territorial government were partly borne by the United 
States, statehood was voted against in i860, and again (virtually) 
in 1864 after Congress had passed an Enabling Act; but in 

1866 a constitution framed by the legislature was declared 
carried by the people by a majority of 100 votes in 7776, and 
Nebraska was admitted as a state (in spite of President Johnson's 
veto) in 1867, after her legislature had accepted a fundamental 
condition imposed by Congress removing the limitation of the 
suffrage to whites by the new constitution. Fraud was charged 
in the Territorial election. At any rate the Republican party 
had worked for admission because it needed senators in Congress, 
and it got them. During part of 1866-186 7 there were two 
de facto governments, the Territorial and the state. 

The capital of the Territory remained always at Omaha, 
although in 1858 a majority of the legislature removed to Florence 
leaving the governor and a legislative rump at Omaha. In 

1867 the South Platte region, having obtained a predominance 
in population capable of overcoming a gerrymander that had 
favoured the North Platte (and incidentally the Democrats), 
secured the appointment of a legislative committee to locate 
the state capital S. of the Platte. Several of the old Missouri 
river contestants had as representatives of their previous 
claims young towns located at strategic points in the interior. 
The committee avoided these and selected the site of Lincoln. 
Just ten years earlier the legislature had considered removal 
to another site on the Salt, to be called " Douglas " in honour 
of Stephen A. Douglas, then still in the heyday of his popularity. 

The decade 1870-1880 was marked by the work of the two 
constitutional conventions described above. The first legislature 
under the constitution of 1875 met in 1877. The following 
decade was marked by a tremendous growth in population, 









NEBRASKA CITY— NEBUCHADREZZAR 



33i 



by a feverish activity in railway construction (the mileage 
in the state being increased from 1953 to 5407 m. in the ten 
years), and by an extraordinary rise in land values, urban and 
rural. Farm-land prices were raised to a basis of maximum 
productiveness when the best interests, especially of the western 
section, demanded steady growth based on average crop results 
under average conditions. The early 'nineties were marked 
by an economic collapse of false values, and succeeding years 
by a painful recovery of stable conditions. 

The Democratic and Republican parties were first effectively 
organized in opposition, as parts of national bodies, in the 
territorial campaigns of 1858. Till then there were practically 
only Democratic factions; after 1861 the Republicans held 
the state securely until 1890. After about 1890 the national 
tendencies towards a re-alignment of political parties on social- 
economic issues were sharply displayed in Nebraska. This 
was in the main only an indication of the general Farmers' 
Movement (q.v.), 1 but this found in Nebraska special stimulus 
in large losses (almost $900,000) suffered by the state from 
the negligence and defalcation of certain Republican office- 
holders. Following 1890 the " Fusion " movement — the fusion, 
that is, of Populists, Democrats and (after 1896) of Silver 
Republicans — was of great importance. The only year in which 
these elements carried the state against the Republicans for 
presidential electors was in 1896, when William J. Bryan of 
Lincoln was their presidential candidate; although the state 
delegation of representatives and senators in Congress was 
for a time divided. The Fusionists practically controlled the 
state government from 1 897-1899; they held the legislature from 
1891-1895 and from 1897-1899, the supreme court from 1899- 
1901, and the governorship and executive departments from 
1895-1901; they elected a Democratic governor also for 1891- 
1893; but he was not of the true Fusion type, and vetoed a 
maximum railway freight-rate bill, although his Republican 
successor approved one. The year 1891 was the most feverish 
political year of this period. Apart from these temporary Fusion 
successes the Republicans have always controlled the state.

1 Nebraska was one of the states in which the collapse of the co- 
operative enterprises of the Grange was particularly severe. The 
Farmers' Alliance was organized for the state in 1887, became a 
secret organization in 1889, and, as in other states, was a power 
by 1890. The membership of Grange, Alliance and Knights of 
Labour went over generally speaking into the People's party.

NEBRASKA CITY, a city and the county-seat of Otoe county, 
Nebraska, U.S.A., situated on the high W. bank of the Missouri 
river, about 40 m. below Omaha. Pop. (1880) 4183; (1890) 
11,494; (1900) 7380 (882 foreign-born); (1910) 5488. It is 
served by the Chicago, Burlington & Quincy, and the Missouri 
Pacific railway systems. A railway and wagon bridge spans 
the Missouri. The city is the seat of the state Institute for 
the Blind (1875), and has three public parks and a public library. 
The city is a distributing centre for a beautiful farming region, 
the trade in grain being especially large. In 1900 Nebraska City 
ranked third among the manufacturing cities of the state, the 
manufactures including canned fruits and vegetables, packed 
pork, flour, oatmeal, hominy, grits, meal, starch, cider-vinegar, 
agricultural implements, windmills, paving bricks, concrete, 
sewer pipe, beer, over-alls and shirts. It is one of the oldest 
settlements of the state. The first " old Fort Kearney " was 
established on the site of Nebraska City in 1847, but was 
abandoned in 1848, and the fort was re-established farther W. on 
the Platte river (see Kearney). Otoe county was organized in 
1855, and the original Nebraska City was incorporated and 
made the county-seat in the same year. This city, together 
with Kearney City, incorporated in 1855 — adjacent to the first 
" old " Fort Kearney — and South Nebraska City, were con- 
solidated by the legislature into the present Nebraska City in 
1858. (Twelve other city " additions " and so-called " towns," 
all within or closely adjacent to the present city, were in existence 
in 1857.) Nebraska City was for some years the largest city 
of the state. In 1858 it became the headquarters of a great 
freigh ting-firm that distributed supplies for the United Stages 
government among the army posts between the Missouri river 
and the Rocky Mountains; in seven months in 1859 this one 
firm employed 602 men, used 517 wagons, 5682 oxen, and 75 
mules, and shipped 2,782,258 lb. of freight. Nebraska City was 
the initial point of several roads, parts at one time or another 
of the " Oregon," " Old California," and " Great Salt Lake " trails. 
(See Nebraska (State) : History.) Nebraska City became a city 
of the second class in 1871 and a city of the first class in 1901. 

NEBUCHADREZZAR, or Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, 
th$ NafiovKo8p6o*opos of the Greeks. The first and last are 
nearer to the original name as it is found on the cuneiform 
monuments, viz. Nabu-kudurri-usur, " Nebo, defend the 
landmark." Nebuchadrezzar seems to have been of Chaldean 
origin. He married Amuhia, daughter of the Median king, 
according to Abydenus, and in 605 B.cl defeated Necho at 
Carchemish, driving the Egyptians out of Asia and annexing 
Syria to the Babylonian empire. In the following year h.e 
succeeded his father Nabopolassar on the Babylonian throne, 



332

and continued the restoration of Babylon, which he made one 
of the wonders of the world. His " new palace " there was 
built in fifteen days; temples were erected to the gods, the 
great walls of the city were constructed with a moat surrounding 
them, the Euphrates was lined with brick and a strong fortress 
erected. Canals were dug throughout the country and a great 
reservoir excavated near the capital. Only a fragment of his 
annals has been preserved, recording his campaign against 
Amasis (Ahmosi) of Egypt in his thirty-seventh year (567 B.C.) 
when he defeated the soldiers of " Phut of the Ionians."* Tyre 
revolted in the seventh year of his reign, and was besieged for 
thirteen years; a contract-tablet dated in his fortieth year 
shows that at that time it was under Babylonian officials. After 
the investment of Tyre Nebuchadrezzar marched against 
Jerusalem, put Jchoiakim to death and placed Jehoiachin 
on the throne. Three months later Jehoiachin was deposed 
and Zedekiah made king in his place. Zedekiah's revolt in 
588 B.C. led to another siege of Jerusalem, which was taken 
and destroyed in 586 B.C. (see Jews and Jerusalem). ' To this 
period probably belong an inscription of Nebuchadrezzar on 
the north bank of the Nahr el-Kelb near Beirut, and another 
in the Wadi Brissa in the Lebanon. From his inscriptions we 
gather that Nebuchadrezzar was a man of peculiarly religious 
character. A younger brother of his is called Nabo-sum-lisir.

NEBULA (Lat. for " cloud," connected with the Gr. ve^eXrj, 
mist or cloud), in astronomy, the name given to certain luminous 
cloudy patches in the heavens. They resemble the stars in that 
they retain the same relative positions, and thus may be dis- 
tinguished from the comets which appear to wander across the 
stars. When examined with sufficient telescopic power, a great 
many of these luminous patches are perceived to be composed 
of clusters of little stars, which in a smaller telescope are invisible 
separately, but whose rays of light blend together so as to 
produce a confused luminous appearance. Others, however, 
cannot be resolved into individual stars even with the best 
telescopes, and in many cases the spectroscope gives direct 
evidence that the nebula has a constitution altogether different 
from that of a. star-cluster. We thus distinguish between the 
nebulae proper and the star-clusters; but owing to the difficulty of 
deciding the nature in any particular case, and especially owing 
to the fact that some of the earlier observers believed it probable 
that all nebulae would with sufficient telescopic power become 
resolvable into stars, the term nebula is often used to cover 
both star-clusters and the true nebulae. 

An enumeration of nebulae was made by Charles Messier in 
Paris in 1771, who recorded 163; Sir William Herschel increased 
the number known to over 2500; whilst Sir John Herschel 
between 1825 and 1847 catalogued and described 3926 nebulae 
(including 1700 observed at the. Cape of Good Hope). About 
1848 the earl of Rosse with his famous six-foot reflector at 
Parsonstown began his examination of the nebulae, which added 
greatly to our knowledge of their forms and structure. In 
more modern times the development of photography has 
enabled the features of the nebulae to be ascertained and 
recorded with a certainty, which, unfortunately, the older visual 
observations and drawings cannot claim to possess. In this con- 
nexion the photographic work of Isaac Roberts, A. A. Common, 
E. E. Barnard and J. E, Keeler in particular must be mentioned. 
The total number of known nebulae has, too, been enormously 
increased; Perrine estimates that the number within the power 
of the Crossley reflector at Lick is not less than half a million. 

Nebulae may be conveniently classified according to their 
telescopic appearance; we enumerate below some of the principal 
forms that have been recognized, but it must be observed that 
this classification is rather superficial, and that the differentia- 
tion is often one of appearance only and not of real structure. 
The types are: (1) Irregular nebulae, examples: the great 
nebula of Orion £M. 42), 1 the "key-hole "nebula near rj Argus, 

1 i,e. No. 42 in Messier's catalogue. Nebulae not contained in 
that catalogue are generally known by their number in Dreyer's 
New General Catalogue (N.G.C.). 



the " Omega " nebula (M. 17); (2) Annular nebulae, example: 
M. 37 in Lyra; (3) Double nebulae, example: the dumb-bell 
nebula (M. 27) in Vulpecula; (4) Planetary nebulae, examples: 
the " owl " nebula (M. 97) in Ursa Major, M. 1 in Taurus; (5) 
Elliptical nebulae, example: the great nebula of Andromeda 
(M. 31); (6) Spiral nebulae, example: M. 51 in Canes Venatici; 
(7) Nebulous stars ; (8) Diffused nebulosities. Most of these names 
require little explanation. The first class have ill-defined irregular 
boundaries; their forms often suggest the appearance of curdled 
liquid or wreaths of smoke. The annular nebulae have a ringed 
appearance, the centre being much darker than the outer parts, 
though it is filled with faintly luminous matter. Double nebulae 
have two principal centres of condensation. The planetary 
nebulae are nearly uniformly illuminated compact patches 
of light generally circular or elliptical in shape; they were so 
called because they appeared to possess disks like planets. 
Elliptical nebulae are usually nebulae of some flat type (such 
as annular or spiral) seen rather edgeways, so that the structure 
is not readily recognizable. The typical spiral nebulae are in 
the form of a double spiral, the two branches of which proceed 
from diametrically opposite points of a bright nucleus and 
wind round it in the same sense; the whole is generally studded 
with points of condensation. The great majority of the nebulae, 
including the abundant small nebulae which shine with a white 
light (in contrast with the blue-green light of the planetary 
and irregular nebulae — see below Spectra of nebulae), are generally 
classed as spiral nebulae. The spiral structure has been shown 
to exist in a few of them, but for the remainder it is only inferred. 
Nebulous stars are true stars surrounded by an atmosphere 
or aureole of nebulous light. Diffused nebulosities are very 
faint nebulae of enormous extent, sometimes forming the back- 
ground of a whole constellation. We proceed to describe some 
of the more famous nebulae. 

One of the most remarkable nebulae is that which is situated 
in the sword-handle of Orion and about the multiple star d 
Orionis; it is faintly visible to the naked eye. It seems to have 
been first noticed by Huygens in 1656, who described and 
figured it in his System Saturnium. It has now been found that 
nebulous streamers connected with the bright nucleus wind 
through the whole constellation of Orion. It is well known 
that all the brighter stars of the constellation except Betelgeuse 
appear to be related to one another by their similarity both 
of spectra and of proper motion; it seems probable that they | 
are actually situated in the nebula and in some way connected 
with it. 

The only other nebula which can be seen with the naked eye 
is the elliptical nebula in Andromeda. Modern photographs 
show very clearly that its structure is spiral. The nucleus is 
large and appears circular, but the spirals proceeding from it 
lie in a plane inclined at a rather sharp angle to the line of sight, 
and this gives to the nebula its elliptical appearance. Two 
small dense nebulae accompany it, and appear to belong to the 
system. 

The finest example of a ring nebula is M. 57 between /3 and y 
Lyrae. The ring is slightly elliptical, its dimensions being 
87* by 64". At the ends of the major axis the ring becomes 
very faint, so that the form of the bright part may justly be 
compared to a pair of marks of parenthesis ( ). The centre is 
marked by a star which appears to be intimately associated 
with the ring, for the whole space within the ring is filled with 
a very faint nebulosity. ■ According to Schaeberle, there is 
evidence of a spiral structure in this nebula also. It must, 
however, clearly be of an essentially different character from 
the structure of an ordinary spiral nebula, and the spectroscope 
reveals a fundamental difference between the annular and 
spiral nebulae. 

The " dumb-bell " nebula in Vulpecula consists of two almost 
separated fan-shaped patches of light. It exhibits a close resem- 
blance to the annular nebula; for we have only to assume a 
continuation of the thinning out along the longest diameter and 
a slight filling in of the centre of the Lyra nebula to obtain the 
dumb-bell form.

Of planetary nebulae one of the best known is the "owl 
nebula " in the Great Bear about midway between " the pointers." 
As seen with Lord Rosse's reflector, it presented a startling appear- 
ance, resembling the face of a goblin; two faint stars shone in 
the centres of the two dark circles which represented the saucer- 
eyes of the creature. Some change has certainly taken place 
since then, for the two stars no longer could be supposed to 
represent the pupils of the eyes; the cause may, however, be 
merely the proper motion of the stars or of the nebula. 

The discovery of great regions having a faint nebulous back- 
ground is one of the most remarkable results of modern work. 
Particularly interesting is the fact that, whilst the large telescopes 
are unable to render them perceptible to the eye or to photograph 
them, they are revealed by what at first sight seems an absurdly 
simple apparatus. For the study of the ordinary nebulae 
large reflecting telescopes (preferably of short focal length) are 
used, the great light-gathering power being all important; but 
for photographing these diffused nebulosities portrait lenses 
of very small aperture and focal length are most successful. 
Thus the great extension of the Orion nebula was photographed 
by W. H. Pickering in 1890 with a lens 2-6 in. in aperture 
and of 8-6 in. focal length; the exposure was rather more than 
six hours. Other extensive nebulous regions of a similar character 
have been found by Barnard in the constellations Ophiuchus, 
Scorpio and Taurus. 

Spectra of Nebulae. — Owing to the feebleness of their light the 
study of the spectra of nebulae is one of particular difficulty. 
Two varieties of spectra are recognized; the one consists of a 
few narrow bright lines with sometimes a faint continuous 
spectrum for a background,; the other consists of a continuous 
spectrum crossed by dark lines and is indistinguishable from 
that of ordinary stars. The former variety unmistakably 
shows that the light proceeds from diffuse incandescent vapour; 
nebulae showing this spectrum are accordingly called " gaseous." 
Irregular, annular and planetary nebulae are of this nature. 
The visual spectrum is marked by three bright lines in the 
blue and green of wave-lengths 5007, 4959 and 4861. Of 
these the last is the line H |3 of the hydrogen series; the other 
two are of unknown origin, and as they are always found together 
and have always the same relative intensity, they have both 
been attributed to the same unknown element, which has been 
named " nebulium." Usually there are no other conspicuous 
lines in the visual spectrum, but in the ultra-violet region 
numerous lines can be photographed, including most of the 
hydrogen series. The yellow line (D3) of helium can be detected 
in many nebulae. The great majority of the nebulae, however, 
show the second variety of spectrum, and are thus indistinguish- 
able spectroscopicaily from irresolvahle star-clusters. The 
great nebula of Andromeda and the spiral nebulae are of this 
kind. It is not necessary to conclude that they, therefore, are 
star-clusters whose components are, owing to their remoteness 
from us, too faint and close together to be separately distinguish- 
able. A gaseous mass only gives a bright line spectrum when 
it is so rarefied as to be transparent through and through. If 
the density and thickness are such that a ray of light cannot 
pass through it the spectrum will, in general, be continuous 
like that of a solid body. 

The inquiry into -the physical state and constitution of the 
nebulae raises problems of great difficulty. In the case of 
" gaseous " nebulae it is very hard to understand how such 
extremely tenuous masses are maintained in a state of incan- 
descence. Only one theory has been put forward which at all 
accounts for this fact, and unfortunately, it is not altogether 
satisfactory in other respects. This is Sir Norman Lockyer's 
"Meteoritic Hypothesis," which attributes the light to col- 
lisions between numbers of small discrete solid particles, 
these being vaporized and made luminous owing to the heat 
developed by their impacts. Formidable difficulties, however, 
prevent the entire acceptance of this suggestion. 

The spiral nebulae are not distributed at random over the 
sky, nor are they condensed along the galactic plane like the 
clusters which they " spectroscopicaily resemble. There is a 



well-marked centre of aggregation of the northern nebulae near 
the north galactic pole. In the southern hemisphere they are 
more evenly distributed, but the avoidance of the galactic plane 
is marked. The remarkable Nubeculae or Magellanic Clouds 
in the southern hemisphere, which look like detached portions 
of the Milky Way, are found on telescopic examination to consist, 
not of stars alone, like the Milky Way, but of stars and nebulae 
clustering together. In the greater cloud Sir John Herschel 
counted 286 nebulae; in the lesser cloud they are rather less 
numerous:

NEBULAR THEORY, a theory advanced to account for the 
origin of the solar system. It is emphatically a speculation; 
it cannot be demonstrated by observation or established by 
mathematical calculation. Yet the boldness and the splendour 
of the nebular theory have always given it a dignity not usually 
attached to a doctrine which from the very nature of the case 
can have but little direct evidence in its favour. 

There are very remarkable features in the solar system which 
point unmistakably to some common origin of many of the 
different bodies which it contains. We may at once put the 
comets out of view. It does not appear that they bear any 
testimony on either side of the question. We do not know 
whether the comets are really indigenous to the solar system 
or whether they may not be merely imported into the system 
from the depths of space. Even if the comets be indigenous 
to the system, they may, as many suppose, be merely ejections 
from the sun. In any case the orbits of comets are exposed 
to such tremendous perturhations from the planets that it is 
unsafe from the present orbit of a comet to conjecture what 
that orbit may have been in remote antiquity. On these grounds 
we discuss the nebular theory without much reference to comets. 
But even after the omission of all cometary objects we can still 
count in the solar system upwards of five hundred bodies, 
almost every one of which pronounces distinctly, though with 
varying emphasis, in favour of the nebular theory. 

The first great fact to be noticed is that the planets revolve 
around the sun in the same direction. This is true not only 
of the major planets Mercury, Venus, the Earth, Mars, Jupiter, 
Saturn, Uranus and Neptune; it is also true of the host of 
more than five hundred minor planets. It is also remarkable 
that all the great planets and many of the small ones have 
their orbits very nearly in the same plane, and nearly circular 
in form. Viewed as a question in probabilities, we calculate 
the chance that five hundred bodies revolving round the sun 
shall all be moving in the same direction. The improbability 
of such an arrangement is enormously great. It is represented 
by the ratio of a number containing about a hundred and sixty 
figures to unity, and so we are at once forced to the conclusion 
that this remarkable feature of the planetary motions must have 
some physical explanation. In a minor degree this conclusion 
is strengthened by observing the satellites. Discarding those 
of Uranus, in which the orbits of the satellites are highly inclined 
to the ecliptic, and in which manifestly some exceptional in- 
fluences have been at work, we find that the satellites revolve 
around the primaries also in the same direction; 1 while, to make 
the argument complete, the planets, so far as they can be 
observed, rotate on their axes in the same manner. • 

The nebular theory offers an explanation of this most remark- 
able uniformity. Laplace supposed the existence of a primeval

the satellite of Neptune.

NEBULAR THEORY 



nebula which extended so far out as to fill all the space at present 
occupied by the planets. This gigantic nebulous mass, of 
which the sun was only the central and somewhat more con- 
densed portion, is supposed to have a movement of rotation on 
its axis. There is no difficulty in conceiving how a nebula, 
quite independently of any internal motion of its parts, shall 
also have had as a whole a movement of rotation. In fact a 
little consideration of the theory of probabilities will show it 
to be infinitely probable that such an object should really have 
some movement of rotation, no matter by what causes the 
nebula may have originated. As this vast mass cooled it 
must by the laws of heat have contracted towards the centre, 
and as it contracted it must, according to a law of dynamics, 
rotate more rapidly. The time would then come when the 
centrifugal force on the outer parts of the mass would more 
than counterbalance the attraction of the centre, and thus 
we would have the outer parts left as a ring. The inner portion 
will still continue to contract, the same process will be repeated, 
and thus a second ring will be formed. We have thus grounds 
for believing that the original nebula will separate into a series 
of rings all revolving in the same direction with a central nebulous 
mass in the interior. The materials of each ring would continue 
to cool and to contract until they passed from the gaseous to 
the liquid condition. If the consolidation took place with 
comparative uniformity we might then anticipate the formation 
of a vast multitude of small planets such as those we actually 
do find in the region between the orbit of Mars and that of 
Jupiter. More usually, however, the ring might be expected 
not to be uniform, and, therefore, to condense in some parts 
more rapidly than in others. The effect of such contraction 
would be to draw the materials of the ring into a single mass, 
and thus we would have a planet formed, while the satellites 
of that planet would be developed from the still nascent planet 
in the same way as the planet itself originated from the sun. 
In this way we account most simply for the uniformity in the 
direction in which the planets revolve, and for the mutual 
proximity of the planes in which their orbits are contained. 

Such was the nebular theory as it was originally sketched. 
At the present day when the nebulae that are spiral in form 
have been shown to be so numerous, next to the fixed stars 
themselves, our view of the nebular theory has been somewhat 
modified. It now seems probable that the spiral nebula is 
the fittest illustration of the transformation of a diffused nebula 
into a system of sun and planets. 

The rotation of the planets on their axes is also explained 
as a consequence of the nebular theory, for at the time of the 
first formation of the planet it must have participated in the 
rotation of the whole nebula, and by the subsequent contraction 
of the planet the speed with which the rotation was performed 
must have been accelerated. 

There is quite a different method of considering the nebular 
origin of our system, which leads in a very striking manner 
to conclusions practically identical with those we have just 
sketched. We may commence by dealing with the sun as we 
find it at the present moment, and thence inferring what must 
have been the progress of events in the earlier epochs of the 
history of our system. 

The daily outpour of heat from the sun at the present time 
suggests a profound argument in support of the nebular theory. 
The amount of the sun's heat has been estimated, but we 
receive on the earth less than one two-thousand-millionth 
part of the whole radiation. It would seem that the greater 
part of the rest flows away to be lost in space. Now what 
supplies this heat? We might at first suppose that the sun 
was really an intensely heated body radiating out its heat as 
does white-hot iron, but this explanation cannot be admitted, 
for there is no historical evidence that the sun is growing 
colder. We have not the slightest reason to think that the 
radiation from the sun is measurably weaker now than it was 
a couple of thousand years ago, yet it can be shown that, if the 
sun were merely radiating heat as simply a hot body, then 
it would cool some degrees every year, and must have cooled 



many thousands of degrees within the time covered by historical 
records. We, therefore, conclude that the sun has some other 
source of heat than that due simply to incandescence. It might, 
for example, be suggested that the heat of the sun was supplied 
by chemical combination analogous to combustion. It would 
take 20 tons of coal a day burned on each square foot of the 
sun's surface to supply the daily radiation. Even if the sun 
were made of one mass of fuel as efficient as coal, that mass 
must be entirely expended in a few thousand years if the present 
rate of radiation was to be sustained. We cannot, therefore, 
admit that the source of the heat in the sun is to be found in any 
chemical combination taking place in its mass. Where then can 
we find an adequate supply of heat ? Only one external source 
can be named: the falling of meteors into the sun must yield 
some heat just as a shooting star yields some heat to our atmo- 
sphere, but the question is whether the quantity of heat obtainable 
from the shooting stars is at all adequate for the purpose. It 
can be shown that unless a quantity of meteors in collective 
mass equal to our moon were to plunge into the sun every year 
the supply of heat could not be sustained from this source. 
Now there is no reason to believe that meteors in anything 
like this quantity can be supplied to the sun, and, therefore, 
we must reject this source as also inadequate. 

The truth about the sun's heat appears to be that the sun is 
really an incandescent body losing heat, but that the operation 
of cooling is immensely retarded owing to a curious circumstance 
due jointly to the enormous mass of the sun and to a remarkable 
law of heat. It is well known that if energy disappears in one 
form it reappears in another, and this principle applied to 
the sun will explain the famous difficulty. 

As the sun loses heat it contracts, and every pair of particles 
in the sun are nearer to each other after the contraction than 
they were before. The energy due to their separation is thus 
less in the contracted state than in the original state, .and as that 
energy cannot be lost it must reappear in heat. The sun is thus 
slowly contracting; but as it contracts it gains heat by the 
operation of the law just referred to, and thus the further cooling 
and further contraction of the sun is protracted until the additional 
heat obtained is radiated away. In this way we can reconcile 
the fact that the sun is certainly losing heat with the fact that 
the change in temperature has not been large enough to be 
perceived within historic times. 

It has been estimated that the sun is at present contracting 
so that its diameter diminishes 10 m. every century; there 
is, however, now reason to think that the rate of contraction 
is by no means' so rapid as this would indicate. This is an 
inappreciable distance when compared with the diameter of the 
sun, which is nearly a million of miles, but the significance for 
our present purpose depends upon the fact that this contraction 
is always taking place. Assuming the accuracy of the estimate 
just made, we see that a thousand years ago the sun must have 
had a diameter 100 m. greater than at present, ten thousand 
years ago that diameter must have been 1000 m. more than it is 
now, and so on. We cannot perhaps assert that the same rate 
is to be continued for very many centuries, but it is plain that 
the further we look back into the past time the greater must 
the sun have been. 

Dealing then simply with the laws of nature as we know them, 
we can see no limit to the increasing size of the sun as we look 
back. We must conceive a time when the sun was swollen tTT 
such an extent that it filled up the entire space girdled by the 
orbit of Mercury. Earlier still the sun must have reached to 
the earth. Earlier still the sun must have reached to where 
Neptune now revolves on the confines of our system, but the 
mass of the sun could not undergo an expansion so prodigious 
without being made vastly more rarefied than at present, 
and hence we are led by this mode of reasoning to the 
conception of the primaeval nebula from which our system has 
originated. 

Considering that our sun is but a star, or but one of the millions 
of stars, it is of interest to see whether any other systems present 
indication of a nebulous origin analogous to that which Laplace 



NECESSITAS— NECK

proposed tor the solar system. In one of his papers, Sir \V. 
Herschei marshals the evidence which can be collected on this 
point- He arranges a selection from his observations on the 
nebulae in such a way as to give great plausibility to his view 
of the gradual transmutation of nebulae into stars Herschei 
begins by showing us that there are regions in the heavens where 
a faint diffused nebulosity is all that can be detected by the 
telescope. There are other nebulae in which a nucleus can be 
just discerned, others again in which the nucleus is easily seen, 
and still others where the nucleus is a brilliant star-like point. 
The transition from an object of this kind to a nebulous star 
is very natural, while the nebulous stars pass into the ordinary 
stars by a few graduated stages. It is thus possible to exhibit 
a series of objects beginning at one end with the most diffused 
nebulosity and ending at the other with an ordinary fixed star 
or group of stars. Each object in the series differs but slightly 
from the object just before it and the object just after it. It 
seemed to Herschei that he was thus able to view the actual 
changes by which masses of phosphorescent or glowing vapour 
became actually condensed down into stars. The condensation 
of a nebula could be followed in the same manner as we can 
study the growth of the trees in the forest, by comparing the 
trees of various ages which the forest contains at the same time. 
In attempting to pronounce on the evidence with regard t to 
Herschers theory, we must at once admit that the transmutation 
of a nebula into a star has never been seen. It is indeed very 
doubtful whether any changes of a nebula have ever been seen 
which are of the same character as the changes Herschel's theory 
would require. It seems, however, most likely that the periods 
of time required for such changes are immense and that the 
changes accomplished in only a century 01 two are absolutely 
inappreciable. 

The nebular theory is a noble speculation supported by plausible 
argument, and the verdict of science on the whole subject cannot 
be better expressed than in the words of S. Newcomb: " At 
the present time we can only say that the nebular hypothesis 
is indicated by the general tendencies of the laws of nature, 
that it has not been proved to be inconsistent with any fact, 
that it is almost a necessary consequence of the only theory 
by which we can account for the origin and conservation of the 
sun's heat, but that it rests on the assumption that this conserva- 
tion is to be explained by the laws of nature as we now see them 
in operation. Should any one be sceptical as to the sufficiency 
of these laws to account for the present state of things, science 
can furnish no evidence strong enough to overthrow his doubts 
until the sun shall be found growing smaller by actual measure- 
ment, or the nebulae be actually seen to condense into stars 
and systems."

NECESSITAS (Gr. *Avay icq), in Orphic theology, the personifica- 
tion of absolute necessity. She aopears as the mother of the 
Moerae (Fates), as the wife of Demiurgus (Fashioner of the 
World) and mother of Heimarmene (Destiny). Her power 
is irresistible, even greater than that of the gods; to her was 
due the strife (battles with Titans, Giants) that raged amongst 
them of old, before the rule of love began; the world revolves 
round the spindle, which she holds in her lap. According to the 
Egyptian theory, she is one of the four deities present at the 
birth of every human being, her companions being the Daemon 
(guardian spirit), Tyche (Fortune) and Eros. On the citadel 
of Corinth there was a temple sacred to her and Bia (Violence), 
which none were permitted to enter. The Roman Necessitas is 
represented in the well-known ode of Horace (i. 35) as the fore- 
runner and companion of Fortuna, holding in her brazen hand 
huge nails, a clamp and molten lead, symbolical of fixedness 
and tenacity.

NECESSITY (Lat. necessitas), a term used technically in 
philosophy for the quality of inevitable happening; for example, 
hot air necessarily tends to rise. Thus it corresponds in the 
sphere of action to certainty in the sphere of knowledge. That 
the sun will rise to-morrow is a necessary event; and men anticipate 
the rising with certainty. In ordinary language the conception 
of necessity is rendered meaningless by being referred to the 
present or even to the past. A current definition of necessity 
is " the state which cannot be otherwise than it is." Such a 
definition tells us nothing. How can any state be otherwise 
than it is? Necessity can have meaning only in reference to 
the future: it means absence of spontaneous power in that 
which acts necessarily. For the origin of the conception we must 
look to our inward personal experience of constraint. When we 
are acting under physical or mathematical oc logical or moral 
necessity we are so far precluded Irom spontaneous action — in 
common phrase, we can do no otherwise — though the causes of 
constraint may be of very different kinds. In ethics the term 
necessitarianism is applied to that view of human action which 
regards all action as dictated by external causes (cf . Determinism). 
The sense in which, .if at all, the human mind can cognize 
necessity, i.e. causal connexion between events or states, has 
been the subject of vigorous discussion among philosophers. 
By sceptics and empiricists it is held that a law is merely a 
crystallized summary of observed phenomena. Thus J. S. 
Mill denies that a general proposition is more than an enumeration 
of particulars, and hence that syllogistic reasoning cannot 
amplify knowledge (see Syllogism). It is clear that the senses 
cannot apprehend causal connexion, and this impossibility gives 
rise to a prior conception according to which the conception 
of necessity is purely intellectual (see Metaphysics). 

NECK (0. Eng. knecca; the word appears in many Teutonic 
languages; cf. Dutch nek, Ger. Nacken; in O. E. the common word 
was keals; cf. Ger. Hals), that part of the body which connects 
the head with the trunk (see Anatomy: Superficial and Artistic). 
The word is transferred to many objects resembling this part 
of the body in shape or function; it is thus applied to an isthmus, 
or to the narrowest portion of a promontory, to the narrow part 
of a musical stringed instrument connecting the head and body, 
as in the violin, or to a narrow pass between mountains, which 
in the Dutch form nek, appears in place-names in South Africa. 
In architecture, the " neck " is that part of the capital just 
above the " astragal," and the term " necking " is applied to 
the annulet or round, or series of horizontal mouldings, which 
separates the capital of a column from the plain part or a shaft. 
In Romanesque work this is sometimes corded. 

In Geology, the term " neck " is given to the denuded stump of an 
extinct volcano. Beneath every volcano there are passages of con- 
duits up which the volcanic materials were forced, and after the mass 
has been levelled by denudation there is always a more or less circular 
pipe which marks the site of the crater. This pipe, which is filled 
with consolidated ashes or with crystalline lava, is the characteristic 
of a volcanic neck. Active volcanoes often stand on the sea-bottom 
and when the eruption comes to an end the volcano is slowly buried 
under layers of sediment. In tropical seas the coral animals cover 
over the submarine volcanoes which rise nearly to the surface and 
form great reefs of limestone around them. Should elevation take 
place after long ages the removal of the overlying strata will bring the 
volcanic mass to light, and in the normal course of things this will 
suffer denudation exactly like a recent volcano. Many instances of 
this are furnished by the geological history of the British Isles. In 
Carboniferous times, for example, before the Coal-measures were 
deposited, a shallow sea occupied the southern part of Scotland and 
the north of England. Volcanic activity broke out on the sea- 
bottom, and many volcanic cones, both small and large, were pro- 
duced. These have long since been uplifted and the superjacent 
strata denuded away over a large part of the area which they occu- 
pied. In_ Derbyshire, Fife, the Lothians and the Glasgow district 
the remains of Carboniferous volcanoes occur in every state of 
preservation. Some have the conical hills of lavas and ashes well 
preserved (e.g. Largo Law in Fifeshire); others retain only a small 
part of the original volcanic pile (e.g. Arthur's Seat, Edinburgh; the 
Sinn of Burntisland) and of the larger number nothing remains but 
the " neck " which shows where once the crater was situated. 

In regions of former volcanic activity necks are the most persistent 
of all volcanic structures, because the active volcanic magma is 
located deep within the earth's crust, and the pipe by which it rises 
to the surface is of great length and traverses a great thickness of 



33^ 



NECKAM 



strata. Many volcanic necks stand on lines of fault. In other cases 
there are groups of necks lying in a straight or sinuous line, which 
may indicate the position of a fracture or at least of a line of least 
resistance. But in Scotland it is often impossible to adduce any 
evidence of the connexion between faults or fissures and the position 
of volcanic necks; and it seems likely that the pressure of the gases 
in the igneous magma increased till an explosion took place which 
perforated the rocks above with a clean tubular passage often nearly 
circular in cross section. This pipe was usually vertical, and nearly 
uniform in diameter for great depths; the material occupying it, 
when exposed by denudation, has a circular ground plan, or if 
shown in vertical section (or elevation) in a cliff is a pillar-shaped 
mass crossing the bedding planes of the strata nearly at right angles. 
It terminates upwards in the remains of the volcanic cone and com- 
municates below with the reservoir from which the lavas were 
emitted, represented in most cases, where it has been exposed, by a 
large irregular mass (a batholith or boss) of coarsely crystalline 
igneous rock. The site of such a neck is generally indicated by a 
low conical hill consisting of volcanic rock, surrounded by^ sedi- 
mentary or igneous strata of a different kind. The low cone is due 
to the greater hardness and strength of the volcanic materials and 
is not connected with the original shape of the volcano. Such hills 
are common in some parts of Scotland and well- known examples are 
Arthur's Seat and the Castle Rock (Edinburgh), North Berwick Law, 
the Bass Rock; they occur also in the Peak district of Derbyshire, 
and the Wolf Rock off the coast of Cornwall is probably a neck. Two 
splendid sugar-loaf cones known as the Pitons of St Lucia in the West 
Indies, rising from the sea with almost vertical sides to a height of 
nearly 3000 ft., are old volcanic necks. In Texas, New Mexico, 
Arizona, California and many of the western states of North 
America geologists have observed conical volcanic hills having all 
the features which belong to necks. 

Where the volcanic rocks are soft and easily disintegrated they may 
be reduced more rapidly than the strata around them and the 
position of a neck may be indicated by a cup-shaped hollow; this 
is the case with some of the diamond-bearing basic pipes of South 
Africa. Sometimes necks are encountered in underground mining 
operations; in the coal-field of Fife, for instance, the coals are 
sometimes replaced by a circular mass of volcanic rock, a quarter of 
a mile or more in diameter, which rise vertically to the surface. 
Better examples are the Kimberley diamond mines. The blue-ground 
(or serpentine breccia) occupies great pipes or funnels, circular in 
outline with nearly vertical sides, extending downwards to un- 
known depths; these are undoubtedly the necks of old volcanoes. 
If any^ lavas were poured out from these pipes at the surface they 
have since been carried away by denudation. 

The size of necks varies considerably; the smallest may be only 
20 or 30 yds. in diameter, the largest are several miles. In 
this respect they resemble active craters, but no necks have been 
met with on the earth's surface with dimensions approaching those of 
the so-called " craters " of the moon. Small necks are usually simple, 
i.e. they contain only one or two kinds of igneous rock (ashes and 
dikes) and have been produced, so far as we can judge, by a single 
eruption. Not infrequently they contain no volcanic rock but are 
filled with pieces of slate, sandstone or whatever strata the pipe 
traverses. Such necks must have been produced by a single eruption 
with an outburst of steam, not followed by lava; the disrupted 
fragments of the surrounding rocks and the materials tumbling down 
from the crater's walls ultimately filled up the cavity. Instances 
occur in Fifeshire and in Shetland, and among the recent volcanoes 
of the Eiffel there are some which have thrown out more slate and 
sandstone than lava. 

Large necks, on the other hand, are often of complex structure, 
contain many kinds of rock and seem to have been produced by 
repeated eruptions, each of which more or less completely cleared 
out the material obstructing the orifice, and introduced a series of 
fresh accumulations. The beds of ashes which line the interior of an 
active crater have in nearly all cases a slope or dip towards a central 
point where the base of the depression is situated, and in volcanic 
necks which have been filled with ash (tuffs and agglomerates) this 
funnel-like inward dip is very constant. If there has been only a 
single eruption the beds of ashes have a very conformable or uniform 
arrangement, but if activity has been resumed after a period of 
quiescence a large part of the old material may have been projected 
and a new series of beds laid down, transgressing unconformably 
the edges of the earlier ones. By these structures we can sometimes 
trace a neck within a neck, or of a lateral crater on the margin of a 
principal one. 

Where the crater has filled up with very coarse ashes, or agglomer- 
ate, the bedding is rarely visible. Sometimes large empty craters 
were occupied temporarily by lakes, and level sheets of mud and silt 
have gathered on their floors: hence bedded sediments are not 
infrequently found in volcanic necks. Mixed with the volcanic ashes 
and bombs there are often large broken pieces of sedimentary rocks 
which may have been crystallized and hardened by the heat and 
vapours emitted by the volcano. Sometimes great fragments of the 
walls have foundered or collapsed into the crater, and masses of ncn- 
volcanic rock, an acre or more in extent, may occur in a volcanic neck. 
In Arran, for example, there is a large neck which contains lumps of 
Cretaceous rocks nowhere else known to occur on the island; they 



have fallen down from strata once occupying part of the walls of the 
crater but now removed by denudation. 

The lava which rises and flows out from the crater leaves its trace 
also in the necks. Sometimes it forms thin beds or flows alternating 
with the tuffs and having the same basin-shaped dip. More commonly 
it appears as the material filling fissures and pipes, traversing the 
ashes irregularly or rising as a central plug in the interior of the 
neck, and sending out branching veins. Occasionally a whole neck is 
composed of solid crystalline rock representing the last part of the 
magma which ascended from the underground focus and con- 
gealed within the crater. In Mont Pelee, Jor instance, the last stage 
of the eruptions of 1902 to 1905 was the protrusion of a great column 
of solidified lava which rose at one time to a height of 900 ft. above 
the lip of the crater, but has since crumbled down. The Castle Rock 
of Edinburgh is a neck occupied by a plug of crystalline basalt. 
Necks of this kind weather down very slowly and tend to form 
prominent hills. 

After the eruptions terminate gases or hot solutions given out by 
deep-lying masses of rnolten rock may find a passage upward through 
the materials occupying the crater, greatly modifying their mineral 
nature and laying down fresh deposits. A good example of secondary 
deposits within a volcanic neck is provided by the Cripple Creek 
mining district of Colorado. The ore-bearing veins are connected 
with volcanic rocks and part of these occupy a vertical circular pipe 
which is a typical volcanic neck. A phbnolitic breccia, greatly 
altered, is the principal rock, and is cut by dikes of phonolite, 
dolerite, &c. The,, country rock is mostly granite and gneiss, and 
blocks of these are common in the breccia. A large volcano was built 
up in Tertiary times on the granite plateau, and has since been almost 
entirely removed by denudation. The gold ores were carried upwards 
by currents of hot water derived from the volcanic magma and were 
deposited along cracks and fissures in the materials which occupied 
the crater, and also in the surrounding rocks (see Volcano).

NECKAM, ALEXANDER (1157-1217), English schoolman 
and man of science, was born at St Albans in September 11 57, 
on the same night as King Richard I. Neckam 's mother nursed 
the prince with her own son, who thus became Richard's foster- 
brother. He was educated at St Albans Abbey school, and began 
to teach as schoolmaster of Dunstable, dependent on St Albans 
Abbey. Later he resided several years in Paris, where by n 80 
he had become a distinguished lecturer of the university. By 
1 1 86 he was back in England, where he again held the place 
of schoolmaster at Dunstable. He is said to have visited Italy 
with the bishop of Worcester, but this statement has been 
doubted; the assertion that he was ever prior of St Nicolas, 
Exeter, seems a mistake: on the other hand, he was certainly 
much at court during some part of his life. Having become 
an Augustinian canon, he was appointed abbot of Cirencester 
in 1 213. He died at Kempsey in Worcestershire in 121 7, and 
was buried at Worcester. Besides theology he was interested 
in the study of grammar and natural history, but his name is 
chiefly associated with nautical science. For in his De naiuris 
rerum and De utensilibus (the former of which, at any 
rate, had become well known at the end of the 12th century, and 
was probably written about 1180) Neckam has preserved to 
us the earliest European notices of the magnet as a guide to 
seamen — outside China, indeed, these seem to be the earliest 
notices of this mystery of nature that have survived in any 
country or civilization. It was probably in Paris, the chief 
intellectual centre of his time, that Neckam heard iow a ship, 
among its other stores, must have a needle placed above a magnet 
(the De utensilibus assumes a needle mounted on a pivot), 
which needle would revolve until its point looked north, and 
thus guide sailors in murky weather or on starless nights. It 
is noteworthy that Neckam has no air of imparting a startling 
novelty: he merely records what had apparently become the 
regular practice of at least many seamen of the Catholic world. 

See Thomas Wright's edition of Neckam's De ncturis rerum and 
De laudibus divinae sapientiae in the Rolls Series (1863), and of 
the De utensilibus in his Volume of Vocabularies. Neckam also wrote 
Corrogationes Prometliei, a scriptural commentary prefaced by a 
treatise on grammatical criticism; a translation of Aesop into Latin 
elegiacs (six fables from this version, as given in a Paris MS., are 
printed in Robert's Fables inSdites); commentaries, still junprinted, 
on portions of Aristotle, Martianus Capella and Ovid's Meta- 
morphoses, and other works. Of all these the De not. rer. t a sort of 
manual of the scientific knowledge of the 12th century, is much the 
most important: the magnet passage herein is in book ii. chap, 
xcviii. (De vi attractiva), p. 183 of Wright's edition. The correspond- 
ing section in the De utensu, is on p. 114 of the Vol. of Vocabs.

NECKAR, a river of Germany, and a right-bank tributary 
of the Rhine, rises between the Black Forest and the Swabian 
Alb, near Schwenningen, in Wurttemberg, at an altitude of 
2287 ft. As far as Rottweil only a mountain stream, it here 
attains the volume of a river, flows N. as far as Horb, thence 
in a north-easterly direction, and with rapid current it passes 
Rottenburg and the university town of Tubingen, taking then 
a generally northerly course. From Esslingen the Neckar 
becomes broader and deeper and its valley very picturesque, 
and after passing Cannstatt, from which point it is navigable 
for small craft, it flows through vine-clad hills by the pleasant 
village of Marbach, Schiller's birthplace, receives at Besigheim 
the waters of its most considerable tributary, the Enz, swirls 
down by Lauffen, and enters the beautiful vale of Heilbronn. 
Hence, between hills crowned by frequent feudal castles, it 
runs by Wimpfen and by Hornberg, where Gotz von Berlichingen 4 
lived, to Eberbach, where it enters the sandstone formation 
of the Odenwald. It now takes a tortuous westerly course, 
and the scenery on its banks becomes more romantic. Winding 
down by Neckarsteinach and Neckargemiind between lofty 
wooded heights, it sweeps beneath the Konigsstuhl (1900 ft.), 
washes the walls of Heidelberg, and now quitting the valley 
enters the plain of the Rhine and falls into that river from the 
right at Mannheim. Its length is 247 m., and its drainage area 
4790 sq. m. Its more important tributaries are the Enz, Eschach 
and Glatt (left), and the Fils, Rems, Kocher and Jagst (right). 
It is navigable for small steamboats up to Heilbronn, for boats 
up to Cannstatt, and for rafts from Rottweil. It is the principal 
waterway of Wiirttemberg, and is greatly used for floating 
down timber. From Rottenburg downwards its banks are almost 
everywhere planted with vineyards. Up to Frankfort it has 
been deepened and the channel otherwise improved. A com- 
mittee, chiefly promoted by the Wurttemberg government 
and the Stuttgart chamber of commerce, reported in 1901 that 
it was both desirable and practicable to dredge the river and 
to canalize it, from Esslingen down to Mannheim, and that the 
cost would probably be between 2 and 2! millions sterling.

NECKARGEMUND, a town and climatic health resort of 
Germany, in .the grand duchy of Baden, situated amid densely 
wooded hills, on the left bank of the Neckar, 6 m. E. from 
Heidelberg by the railway to Wiirzburg and at the junction of 
a line to Jagstfeld. Pop. (1905) 2200. It has an important 
trade in wine. The other industries are quarrying, tanning 
and shipbuilding, and there are electrical works. Neckargemiind, 
one of the favourite tourist resorts in the Neckar valley, was 
founded in the 10th century and became a free town in 1286. 
In 1395 it passed to the elector palatine and, together with the 
surrounding district, was apportioned to Baden in 1814. 

NECKER, JACQUES (1732-1804), French statesman, finance 
minister of Louis XVI., was born at Geneva in Switzerland. 
His' father was a native of Ciistrin in Pomerania, and had, after 
the publication of some works on international law, been elected 
as professor of public law at Geneva, of which he became a citizen. 
Jacques Necker had been sent to Paris in 1747 to become a 
clerk in the bank of a friend of his father, M. Vernet. He soon 
afterwards established, with another Genevese, the famous 
bank of Thellusson & Necker. Thellusson superintended the 
bank in London (his grandson was made a peer as Lord Rendles- 
ham), while Necker was managing partner in Paris. Both 
partners became very rich by loans to the treasury and specula- 
tions in grain. In 1763 Necker fell in love with Madame de 
Vermenou, the widow of a French officer. But while on a visit 
to Geneva, Madame de Vermenou met Suzanne Curchod, the 
daughter of a pastor near Lausanne, to whom Gibbon had been 



engaged, and brought her back as her companion to Paris in 
1764. There Necker, transferring his love from the widow to 
the poor Swiss girl, married Suzanne before the end of the year. 
She encouraged her husband to try and make himself a public 
position. He accordingly became a syndic or director of the 
French East India Company, and, after showing his financial 
ability in its management, defended it in an able memoir against 
the attacks of A. Morellet in 1769. Meanwhile he had made 
interest with the French government by lending it money, and 
was appointed resident at Paris by the republic of Geneva. 
Madame Necker entertained the chief leaders of the political, 
financial and literary worlds of Paris, and her Fridays became 
as greatly frequented as the Mondays of Madame Geoff rin, or 
the Tuesdays of Madame Helvetius. In 1773 Necker won the 
prize of the Academie Francaise for an tloge on Colbert, and in 
1775 published his Essai sur la legislation et le commerce des 
grains j in which he attacked the free-trade policy of Turgot. 
His wife now believed he could get into office as a great financier, 
and made him give up his share in the bank, which he transferred 
to his brother Louis. In October 1776 Necker was made finance 
minister of France, though with the title only of director of 
.the treasury, which, however, he changed in 1777 for that of 
director-general of the finances. He did great good in regulating 
the finances "by attempting to divide the taille or poll tax more 
equally, by abolishing the " vingtieme d'industrie," and establish- 
ing monts de pittt (establishments for loaning money on security). 
But his greatest financial measures were his attempt to fund 
the French debt and his establishment of annuities under the 
guarantee of the state. The operation of funding was too 
difficult to be suddenly accomplished, and Necker rather pointed 
out the right line to be followed than completed the operation. 
In all this he treated French finance rather as a banker than as 
a profound political economist, and thus feU far short of Turgot, 
who was the very greatest economist of his day. Politically 
he did not do much to stave off the coming Revolution, and his, 
establishment of provincial assemblies was only a timid applica- 
tion of Turgot's great scheme for the administrative reorganiza- 
tion of France. In 1781 he published his famous Compte rendu, 
in which he drew the balance sheet of France, and was dismissed 
from his office. Yet his dismissal was not really due to his book, 
but to the influence of Marie Antoinette, whose schemes for 
benefiting the due de Guines he had thwarted. In retirement 
he occupied himself with literature, and with his only child, 
his daughter, who in 1786 married the ambassador of Sweden 
and became Madame de Stael (g.v.). But neither Necker nor 
his wife cared to remain out of office, and in 1787 Necker was 
banished by " lettre de cachet " 40 leagues from Paris for 
attacking Calonne. In 1 788 the country, which had at the bidding 
of the literary guests of Madame Necker come to believe that 
Necker was the only minister who could " stop the deficit," 
as they said, demanded Necker's recall, and in September 1788 
he became once more director-general of the finances. Through- 
out the momentous months which followed the biography of 
Necker is part of the history of the French Revolution (q.v.). 
Necker put a stop to the rebellion in Dauphin6 by legalizing its 
assembly, and then set to work to arrange for the summons 
of the states general. Throughout the early months of 1789 
he was regarded as the saviour of France, but his conduct at 
the meeting of the states general showed that he regarded it 
merely as an assembly which should grant money, not organize 
reforms. But as he had advised the calling of the states general, 
and the double representation of the third estate, and then 
permitted the orders to deliberate and vote in common, he was 
regarded as the cause of the Revolution by the court, and on 
July 11 was ordered to leave France at once. Necker's dismissal 
brought about the taking of the Bastille, which induced the 
king to recall him. He was received with joy in every city he 
traversed, but at Paris he again proved to be no statesman. 
Believing that he could save France alone, he refused to act with 
Mirabeau or La Fayette. He caused the king's acceptance of 
the suspensive veto, by which he sacrificed his chief prerogative 
in September, and destroyed all chance of a strong executive

by contriving the decree of November 7, by which the ministry 
might not be chosen from the assembly. Financially he proved 
equally incapable for a time of crisis, and could not understand 
the need of such extreme measures as the establishment oi 
assignats in order to keep the country quiet. His popularity 
vanished when his only idea was to ask the assembly for new 
loans, and in September 1790 he resigned his office, unregretted 
by a single Frenchman. Not without difficulty he reached 
Coppet, near Geneva, an estate he had bought in 1784. Here 
he occupied himself with literature, but Madame Necker pined 
for her Paris salon and died in 1794. He continued to live on 
at Coppet, under the care of his daughter, Madame de Stael, 
and his niece, Madame Necker de Saussure, but his time was 
past, and his books had no political influence. A momentary 
excitement was caused by the advance of the French armies 
in 1798, when he burnt most of his political papers. He died 
at Coppet in April 1804.

NECROLOGY (from Med. Lat. necrologium, Gr. veicpfc, 
corpse, the termination being formed from My^os, \krycw to 
read, in the sense of list, register; cf. " martyrology "), a register 
in a monastery or other ecclesiastical establishment of the names 
of the deceased members of the society, or of those for whom 
the prayers of the foundation were offered as benefactors; 
hence any roll or list of deceased persons or collection of 
obituaries. 

NECROMANCY (Gr. veKpofiaweia, or veKvofiavrda, from 
vtKp&s or vkicvs, corpse, and juamia, divination) , properly 
divination by communicating with the dead. The latinized 
form of the Greek word was corrupted into nigromantia, con- 
necting the word with niger, black, and so was applied to the 
" black art," " black magic," in the sense of witchcraft, sorcery. 
This corrupted form is common in English to the 17th century 
(see Magic and Witchcraft). 

NECROPOLIS, a cemetery (q.v.) or burying-place, literally 
a " city of the dead " (Gr. veicpbs, corpse, and 7r6\is, city). 
Apart from the occasional application of the word to modern 
cemeteries outside large towns, the term is chiefly used of burial- 
grounds near the sites of the centres of ancient civilizations. 

NECROSIS (Gr. veicpbs, corpse), a term restricted in surgery 
to death of bone. A severe inflammation, caused by a violent 
blow, by cold, or by the absorption of various poisons, as mercury 
and phosphorus, is the general precursor of necrosis. The dead 
part, analogous to the slough in the soft tissues, is called a 
sequestrum or exfoliation. At first it is firmly attached to the 
living bone around; gradually, however, the dead portion is 
separated from the living tissue. The process of separation is 
a slow one. New bone is formed around the sequestrum, which 
often renders its removal difficult. As a rule the surgeon waits 
until the dead part is loose, and then cuts down through the 
new case and removes the sequestrum. The cavity in which 
it lay gradually closes, and a useful limb is the result. 



NECTAR, in ancient mythology generally coupled with am- 
brosia, the nourishment of the gods in Homer and in Greek 
literature generally. Probably the two tetms were not originally 
distinguished; but usually both in Homer and in later writers 
nectar is the drink and ambrosia the food. On the other hand, ■ 
in Alcinan nectar is the food, and in Sappho and Anaxandrides 
ambrosia the drink. Each is used in Homer as an unguent 
(Iliad, xiv. 170; xix. 38). Both are fragrant, and may be used 
as perfume. According to W. H. Roscher (Nektar und Am- 
brosia, 1883; see also his article in Roscher's Lexikon der Mytho- 
logie) nectar and ambrosia were originally only different forms 
of the same substance — honey, regarded as a dew, like manna, 
fallen from heaven, which was used both as food and drink. 
(See also Ambrosia.) 

NEED-FIRE, or Wiud-Fire (Ger. Notfeuer, O. Ger. nodfyr\ 
a term used in folklore to denote a curious superstition which 
survived in the Highlands of Scotland until a recent date. Like 
the fire-churning still customary in India for kindling the sacri- 
ficial fire, the need- or wild-fire is made by the friction of one 
piece of wood on another, or of a rope upon a stake. Need-fire 
is a practice of shepherd peoples to ward off disease from their 
jherds and flocks. It is kindled on occasions of special distress, 
particularly at the outbreak of a murrain, and the cattle are 
driven through it. Its efficacy is believed to depend on all 
other fires being extinguished. The kindling of the need-fire 
in a village near Quedlinburg was impeded by a night light 
burning in the parsonage (Prohle, Harz-BUder, Leipzig, 1855). 
According to one account, in the Highlands of Scotland the rule 
that all common fires must be previously extinguished applied 
only to the houses situated between the two nearest running 
streams (Kelly, Curiosities of Indo-European Tradition and 
Folklore, p. 53 seq.). In Bulgaria even smoking during 
need-fire is forbidden. Two naked men produce the fire by 
rubbing dry branches together in the forest, and with the flame 
they light two fires, one on each side of a cross-road haunted 
by wolves. The cattle are then driven between the two fires, 
from which glowing embers are taken to rekindle the cold hearths 
in the houses (A. Strausz, Die Bulgaren, p. 198). In Caithness 
the men who kindled the need-fire had previously to divest 
themselves of all metal. In some of the Hebrides the men who 
made the fire had to be eighty-one in number and all married. 
In the Halberstadt district in Germany, the rope which was 
wound round the stake, must be pulled by two chaste boys; 
while at Wolfenbiittel, contrary to usual custom, it is said that 
the need-fire had to be struck out of the cold anvil by the smith. 
In England the need-fire is said to have been lit at Birtley 
within the last half-century. The superstition had its origin in 
the early ideas of the purifying nature of flame.

Bough, iii. 301. 

NEEDLE (O. Eng. nmdl-, the word appears in various forms 
in Teutonic languages, Ger. Nadel, Dutch naal, the root being 
ne-, to sew, cf. Ger. nahen, and probably Lat. nere, to spin, Gr. 
vTjacs, spinning), an instrument adapted for passing a thread 
through fabrics in sewing, consisting of a thin rod of steel, having 
a pointed end and pierced with a hole or " eye " to carry the 
thread. The term is also applied to various other objects that 
more or less resemble a sewing needle in form, though differing 
in function, such as the magnetized piece of steel that points 
north and south in the mariner's compass, the pointer or indicator 
of certain forms of electric telegraph instruments, the slender 
tube by which the contents of a hypodermic syringe are injected 
beneath the skin, a sharp-pointed mountain peak or isolated 
mass of rock, &c. 

Sewing needles have been in use from prehistoric times. 
Originally they were made of fishbone, bone or ivory, and their 
first form was probably a rude bodkin having a hook instead 
of an eye, though bone needles with an eye, sometimes at the 
end and sometimes in the middle, have been found in cave de- 
posits in Great Britain and France and in the Swiss lakes. Bone 



NEEDLE-GUN— NEEDLEWORK

needles continue to be used by uncivilized tribes, but since the 
discovery of bronze metal needles have been employed in civilized 
communities. Steel needles were introduced into Europe by 
the Moors, and it is on record that they were being made at 
Nuremberg in 1370. In England their manufacture was estab- 
lished about 1650. The centre of the trade in England is 
Redditch, in Worcestershire, with several other small towns 
in Warwickshire. Originally the industry was domestic in its 
character, but it is now carried on in factories where mechanical 
appliances have to a great extent supplanted handwork. Large 
quantities of needles are also manufactured on the continent of 
Europe, Aix-la-Chapelle being an important centre of their 
production. In the United States ordinary sewing needles 
are not made, though there is a large output of the special forms 
used in sewing machines. 

The raw material of needle-manufacture consists of Sheffield 
crucible steel drawn down into wire of suitable gauge. The wire is 
supplied in coils of definite weight and diameter, and the first 
operation is to cut the coils into lengths, each sufficient for two 
needles. These lengths are next straightened. For this purpose a 
bundle containing several thousand lengths is packed within two 
strong iron rings, is heated to red heat, and is then pressed on an iron 
plate having two parallel grooves in which the iron rings run. Over 
this plate the bundle is worked backward and forward by the pressure 
of an oblong slightly curved iron tool having two longitudinal slits 
through which the edges of the rings project. Thus, by combined 
pressure and rolling the whole of the lengths quickly become perfectly 
straight and even. The next operation consists in pointing both ends 
of the wires. This was formerly done by hand by a grinder who, 
holding several dozen wires against a grindstone with his left hand 
and slightly revolving them with his right, was able to point about 
100,000 needles a day, the number depending, however, to some 
extent on the size treated. This method, however, is now largely 
superseded by machinery, which is still more expeditious. The wires 
are fed out from a hopper to a revolving wheel, on the periphery of 
which they are held by an india-rubber band. This wheel revolves at 
right angles to a revolving hollow grindstone, and so each wire is 
brought up to the stone in rapid succession and pointed at one end, 
the process being repeated for the other end. The next operations 
are to stamp the grooves which are to be found at the head 01 a needle 
and to punch the oval eyes, both being done by automatic machinery. 
Each wire now forms two needles attached head to head by a broad 
thin scarf of steel. The operation of separating them is largely per- 
formed by machines which pass the double blanks over the face of an 
emery wheel, but an oldermethod is to spit them on two flattened 
wires, clamp them tightly in a frame, file away the scarf and break 
the blanks in halves, so that two lots of single needles are obtained, 
each spitted on a wire. The next step, after the heads have been filed 
smooth, is to harden and temper the needles, which are heated to 
redness, plunged into cold oil, and then gently heated by being placed 
on a continuous band passing over a series of gas flames. After the 
tempering comes the process of scouring, and then the eyes are 
smoothed and polished so that they will not cut the thread. For this 
purpose the heads used to be softened by blueing, and the needles 
strung loosely on wires covered with a paste of emery and oil. These 
wires were then suspended between uprights on a frame platform 
to which a jerking motion was communicated; in this way the 
needles were made to swing on the wires and the gentle friction 
effected the desired end. Generally, however, the eyes are cleared by 
the action of a concave wire brush, before the scouring process, and 
then subsequent burnishing becomes unnecessary. The bodies are 
next polished by being passed between revolving leather rollers which 
have also a lateral motion in the direction of their axes. The heads 
of the finished needles have now to be brought all in one direction. 
Formerly this was done by a " header," wearing a cloth cap on one of 
her fingers; this being pressed against a batch of the needles which 
had previously been arranged parallel to each other, those whose 
heads were presented to the cloth stuck in it and thus were with- 
drawn. A more modern device is to roll them down a smooth in- 
clined plane, when the pointed ends, owing to their conical form, 
travel more slowly than the thicker ends, and thus the needles are 
all brought round so that they point the same way. They are then 
sorted according to their lengths, and are done up into packets for 
the market. 

Besides ordinary needles for hand sewing, many varieties are made 
for use in sewing machines, and in their production automatic 
machinery is largely utilized. Those used for sewing leather have 
points of various special forms (twist, chisel, wedge, diamond, &c.) 
instead of the round point of the ordinary needle, and sometimes 
have a hook in place of an eye. Knitting needles are long slender 
rods, usually of steel but sometimes of bone or other material, having 
neither hooks nor eyes. Crochet needles are provided with a hook. 
Hooked needles again are employed in knitting and stockinet 
machines; having to be periodically closed by the operation of the 
mechanism the hooks in one type are made flexible so that they can 



be pushed down on the shank, while in another the same end is 
served by providing them with a minute latch. Another special 
class is constituted by the numerous varieties of needles used by 
surgeons for suturing wounds, &c. (see Surgical Instruments). 

NEEDLE-GUN (Z^ndnadelgewehr), a military breech- 
loading rifle, famous as the arm of the Prussians in 1866 and of 
the Germans in 1870-1871. It was the invention of the gunsmith 
Johann Nicholas von Dreyse (1787-1867), who, beginning in 
1824, had made many experiments, and in 1S36 produced the 
complete needle-gun. From 1841 onwards the new arm was 
gradually introduced into the Prussian service, and later into 
the military forces of many other German states. Dreyse was 
ennobled in 1864. The principal details of the arm (pattern 
1 841) are as follows: — 

Breech Bolt system 

Calibre ..... -607 in. 

Weight without bayonet . 10 lb 4 oz. 

Charge (black powder) . 74*15 grains 

Bullet (lead) ... 478 grains 

Muzzle velocity . * . 1000 f.s. 

Sighted to ... 800 paces (656 yds.) 

In practice the needle-gun proved to have numerous defects; 
its effective range was very short compared to that of the muzzle- 
loading rifles of the day, and conspicuously so as against the 
chassepot : the^ escape of gas at the breech was, moreover, very 
great. A paper cartridge was used. An improved model, 
giving greater muzzle velocity and increased speed in loading, 
was introduced later, but this was soon replaced by the Mauser 
rifle. 

NEEDLEWORK. This subject may be considered under 
the two headings of (1) Plain Needlework, used for purely 
utilitarian purposes, and (2) Art Needlework for decorative 
purposes. Plain needlework requires no such further explanation 
as may be given in the case of art needlework, under which title 
are included (a) embroidery, and (b) other methods of decorative 
needlework, such as applied or appliqu6 work, ornamental 
quilting, patchwork and couching. In these last-mentioned 
methods the needlework is subservient to the decorative effect, 
which depends almost wholly upon the materials selected for 
the purpose; whereas in embroidery the needlework itself 
constitutes and is the visible decoration. The aim of this article 
is to indicate briefly different stitches of plain needlework and 
then to show that these stitches are also used in the domain of 
art needlework. 

The more necessary stitches in plain needlework for making 
clothes are tacking, running, hemming, feather-stitching or 
herring-boning (all of which are practically of the same type), 
and button-holing in which the thread is looped as each stitch 
is made. Button-holing is allied to another looped stitch, 
namely chain-stitching, which though frequently used in em- 
broidery is rarely if ever used in plain needlework. For repairs of 
clothes and household linen, &c, the principal stitch is darning; 
grafting, however, is a substitute for it, and varies with the 
character of the stuff to be repaired, e.g. knitted stockings, 
damask linen, cloth, &c. Darning is allied to running, and graft- 
ing to patchwork. Patchwork as a form of decorative needle- 
work is exemplified in sumptuous canopies and seat covers 
made several centuries B.C. by Egyptians, and rich hangings 
made by Italian and French workers in the 16th century. 

Long and short stitches, kindred in principle to the running 
stitch in plain needlework, are perhaps the more .frequent of 
any stitches used in embroidery, and are especially appropriate 
when the blending of tints with a flat even surface is the effect 
to be aimed at. Much medieval work of this character, as well 
as that done with chain stitch and its allied split stitch, is re- 
garded as typical of opus anglicanum. Chain stitch produces 
a comparatively broken surface in decided contrast with the 
smooth one of long and short stitch, split stitch and satin stitch 
embroidery. Satin stitch is well adapted to express, with even 
flat surface in designs for colour effects, each mass which is 
to be of one tint. In this respect, therefore, satin stitch serves 
a purpose in contrast to that of long and short stitch. A charac- 
teristic of satin-stitching is the sheeny effect produced, on both 



34° 

sides of the material embroidered, by parallel stitches taken 
closely together. Buttonhole stitch in relation to art needle- 
work prevails to a great extent in cut linen and drawn-thread 
work (often called Greek lace), and predominates in the making of 
needlepoint lace (see Lace). In much of the Persian drawn-thread 
work, however, it is superseded by whipping or tightly and closely 
twisting a thread round the undrawn threads of thelinen. Whip- 
ping has been put to another use in certain 16th-century art 
needlework for ecclesiastical purposes, where round the gold 
threads employed as the ground of a design coloured silks are 
dexterously whipped, closely and openly, producing gradations 
of tint suffused with a corresponding variation of golden shimmer. 
Another important branch of art needlework with gold and silver 
threads is couching. When the metallic threads, arranged 
so as to lie closely together, are simply stitched flatly to the found- 
ation material, the work is called flat couching or laying, a kind 
of treatment more frequent in Chinese and Japanese than in 
European art needlework. Flat couching is also carried out 
with floss silks. When a design for couching includes effects 
in relief, stout strings or cords as required by the design are 
first fastened to the foundation materials, and over them the 
metallic threads or in some cases coloured gimps are laid, and 
so stitched as to have an appearance in miniature of varieties 
of willow-twisting or basket work. 

The principle of relief couching is carried much further in 
certain English art needlework, having cumbersome and gro- 
tesque peculiarities, which was done during the reigns of the 
Stuarts. Crude compositions were wrought in partial relief 
with padded work, of costumed figures of kings and queens 
and scriptural persons with a medley of disproportionate animals, 
insects and trees, &c, in which foliage, wings, &c, were of coloured 
silk needlepoint lace — the whole being set as often as not in a 
background of tent or cross-stitch work on canvas. But tent 
and cross-stitch work (in French point comptS) was also used 
by itself for cushion covers and later for upholstery. In its 
earlier phases it seems to come under the medieval classification 
of opus pulvinarum. The reticulations of the canvas or those 
apparent in finer material governed the stitching and imparted 
a stiff formal effect to the designs so carried out, a characteristic 
equally strong in the lacis work, or darning on square mesh net 
(see Lace). 

Applique or applied work belongs as much as patchwork 
to the medieval category of opus consutum y or stitching stuffs 
together according to a decorative design, the greater part of 
which was cut out of material different in colour, and generally 
in texture, from that of the ground to which it was applied and 
stitched. Irish art needlework, called Carrickmacross lace, is for 
the most part of cambric applied or applique to net. 

Quilting is also a branch of art needlework rather than em- 
broidery. Indians and Persians using a short running stitch 
have excelled in it in past times. Some good quilting was done 
in England in the 18th century with chain-stitching which lay 
on the inner side of the stuff, the outer displaying the design 
in 'short stitches. In the account of his voyage to the East 
Indies, published in 1655, Edward Terry (1 590-1 665) writes 
of the Indians " making excellent quilts of satin lined with taffeta 
betwixt which they put cotton wool and worked them together 
with silk." For less bulky quilting, cords have been used; 
and elaborate designs for quilted linen waistcoats were well 
done in the 18th century, with fine short stitches that held the 
cords between the inner and outer materials. 
m A large number of names have been given to the many modifica- 
tions of the limited number of essentially different stitches used in 
plain and art needlework, and on the whole are fanciful rather than 
really valuable from a technical point of view. Much descriptive 
information about them, with an abundance of capital illustrations, 
is given in the Dictionary of Needlework, by J. F. Caul field and 
Blanche Saward (London, 1903). 

NEEMUCH, or Nimach, a town of Central India, with a 
British military cantonment, within the state of Gwalicr, on 
the border of Rajputana, with a station on the Rajputana 
railway, 170 m. N. of Mhow. Pop. (1901) 21,588. In 1857 it was 
the most southerly place to which the Mutiny extended. The

brigade of native troops of the Bengal army, which was stationed 
there, mutinied and marched to Delhi, the European officers 
taking refuge in the fort, where they were besieged by a rebel 
force from Mandasor, and defended themselves gallantly until 
relieved by the Malwa field force. Since 1895 it has been the 
headquarters of the political agent in Malwa. 

NEENAH, a city of Winnebago county, Wisconsin, U.S.A., 
on the N.W. shore of Lake Winnebago, 82 m. N. by E. of Mil- 
waukee. Pop. (1890) 5083; (1900) 5954, of whom 1559 were 
foreign-born; (1905) 6047; (1910) 5734- It is served by the 
Chicago & North-Western, the Chicago, Milwaukee & St Paul, 
and the Milwaukee, St Paul & Sault Ste Marie railways, by two 
interurban electric railways, and by steamboat lines on the lake 
and on the Fox river, which flows out of Lake Winnebago at 
this point. Several bridges connect it with Menasha, on the 
opposite side of the river, and the two cities- form one industrial 
community. Doty Island, at the mouth of the river, belongs 
partly to Neenah and partly to Menasha. Neenah is a trade 
centre of the surrounding agricultural region, in which dairying, 
especially cheese-making, is carried on extensively. The Fox 
river (with a fall of 12 ft.) furnishes good water-power for the 
manufactories. There was a trading post at or near the site of 
Neenah during the French regime in Wisconsin, but there was 
no actual settlement until well into the 19th century. Neenah 
was chartered as a city in 1873; its name is derived from an 
Indian word meaning " running water " or " rapids." 

NEER, VAN DER. Aernout and Eglon van der Neer, father 
and son, were Dutch painters whose lives filled almost the whole 
of the 17th century. 

1. Aernout van der Neer (i 603-1677), commonly called 
Aert or Artus, was the contemporary of Albert Cuyp and 
Hobbema, and so far like the latter that he lived and died in 
comparative obscurity. Aernout was born at Gorkum and 
died at Amsterdam. Houbraken's statement that Aernout 
had been a steward to a Dutch nobleman, and an amateur 
painter, before he settled in Amsterdam and acquired skill 
with his brush, would account for the absence of any pictures 
dating from his early years. He died in abject poverty, and his 
art was so little esteemed that the pictures left by him were 
valued at about five shillings apiece. Even as early as 1659 
he found it necessary to supplement his income by keeping a 
wine tavern. The earliest pictures in which Aernout coupled 
his monogram of A. V. and D. N. interlaced with a date are a 
winter landscape in the Rijks Museum at Amsterdam (dated 
1639), an d another in the Martins collection at Kiel (1642) — 
immature works both, of poor quality. Far better is the " Winter 
Landscape " (1643) in Lady Wantage's collection, and the 
" Moonlight Scene " (1644) in the d'Arenberg collection in 
Brussels. In 1652 Aernout witnessed the fire which consumed the 
old town-hall of Amsterdam. He made this accident the subject 
for two or three pictures, now in the galleries of Berlin and Copen- 
hagen. Though Amsterdam appears to have been constantly van 
der Neer's domicile, his pictures tell that he was well acquainted 
with the canals and woods about Haarlem and Leiden, and 
with the reaches of the Maes and Rhine. Dort, the home of 
Albert Cuyp, is sometimes found in his pictures, and substantial 
evidence exists that there was friendship between the two 
men. At some period of their lives they laid their hands to the 
same canvases, on each of which they left their joint mark. 
On some it was the signature of the name, on others the more 
convincing signature of style. There are landscapes in the collec- 
tions of the dukes of Bedford and Westminster, in which Cuyp 
has represented either the frozen Maes with fishermen packing 
herrings, or the moon reflecting its light on the river's placid 
waters. These are models after which van der Neer appears 
to have worked. The same feeling and similar subjects are found 
in Cuyp and van der Neer, before and after their partnership. 
But Cuyp was the leading genius. Van der Neer got assistance 
from him; Cuyp expected none from van der Neer. He care- 
fully enlivened his friend's pictures, when asked to do so, with 
figures and cattle. It is in pictures jointly produced by them 
that we discover van der Neer's presence at Dort. We are near 



NEERWINDEN 



34i 



Dort in the landscape sunset of the Louvre, in which Cuyp 
evidently painted the foreground and cows. In the National 
Gallery picture Cuyp signs his name on the pail of a milkmaid, 
whose figure and red skirt he has painted with light effectiveness 
near the edge of van der Neer's landscape. Again, a couple of 
fishermen with a dog, and a sportsman creeping up to surprise 
some ducks, are Cuyp's in a capital van der Neer at the Staedel 
Institute in Frankfort. 

Van der Neer's favourite subjects were the rivers and water- 
courses of his native country either at sunset or after dark. 
His peculiar skill is shown in realizing transparence which allows 
objects — even distant — to appear in the darkness with varieties 
of warm brown and steel greys. Another of his fancies is to paint 
frozen water, and his dayh'ght icescapes with golfers, sleighers, 
and fishermen are as numerous as his moonlights. But he always 
avoids the impression of frostiness, which is one of his great 
gifts. His pictures are not scarce. They are less valuable in 
the market than those of Cuyp or Hobbema; but, possessing 
a charm peculiarly their own, tliey are much sought after by 
collectors. Out of about one hundred and fifty pictures accessible 
to the pubb'c, the choicest selection is in the Hermitage at St 
Petersburg. In England paintings from his brush are to be 
found at the National Gallery and Wallace Collection, and, 
amongst others, in the collections of the marquess of Bute 
and Colonel Holford. 

2. Eglon van der Neer (1643-1703) was born at Amsterdam, 
and died at Dusseldorf on the 3rd of May 1703. He was first 
taught by his father, and then took lessons from Jacob van Loo, 
whose chief business then consisted in painting figures in the 
landscapes of Wynants and Hobbema. When van Loo went 
to Paris in 1663 to join the school from which Boucher afterwards 
emerged, he was accompanied or followed by Eglon. But, 
leaving Paris about 1666, he settled at Rotterdam, where he 
dwelt for many years. Later on he took up his residence at 
Brussels, and finally went to Dusseldorf, where he entered the 
service of the elector-palatine Johann Wilhclm von der Pfalz. 
In each of the places where he stopped Eglon married, and having 
had three wives became the father of twenty-five children. 
A portrait of the princess of Neuberg led to his appointment 
as painter to the king of Spain. 

Eglon van der Neer has painted landscapes imitating those 
of his father, of Berchem, and of Adam Elsheimer. He frequently 
put the figures into the town views of Jan van der Heyden in 
competition with Berchem and Adrian van der Velde. His 
best works are portraits, in which he occasionally came near 
Ter Borchor Metsu in delicacy of touch, de Hooch in effective- 
ness of lighting, or Mieris in polish of surface. One of his earliest 
pieces in which the influence of Ter Borch is apparent is the 
" Lady with the Book," of 1665, which was sold with theBredel 
collection in 1875. A young woman in white and red satin at 
Rotterdam, of 1669, recalls Mieris, whose style also reappears 
in Eglon's " Cleopatra " at Buckingham Palace. Two land- 
scapes with " Tobit and the Angel," dated 1685 and 1694, 
in the museums of Berlin and Amsterdam, illustrate his fashion 
of setting Scripture scenes in Dutch backgrounds. m The most 
important of his sacred compositions is the " Esther and 
Ahasuerus," of 1696, in the Uffizi at Florence. But Eglon 
varied his practice also with arrangements of hunting and 
hawking parties, pastures and fords, and cavalry skirmishes. 
The latest of his panels is a mountain landscape of 1702 in 
the gallery of Augsburg. (J. A. C. ; P. G. K.) 

NEERWINDEN, a village of Belgium in the province of Liege, 
a few miles E. by S. of Tirlcmont, which gives its name to two 
great battles, the first fought in 1693 between the Anglo-Allied 
army under William III. of England and the French under the 
duke of Luxemburg, and the second in 1793 between the Austrians 
under Prince Josias of Coburg and the French under General 
Dumouriez. 

Battle of Neerwinden or Landen, 1693 (see Grand Alliance, 
War of the). — Luxemburg, having by feints induced William 
to detach portions of his army, rapidly drew together superior 
numbers in face of the Allied camps, which lay in a rough 



semicircle from Elissem on the right to Neerlanden, and thence 
along the Landen brook on the left (July 18-28, 1693). 
William had no mind to retire over the Geete river, and en- 
trenched a strong line from Laer through Neerwinden to Neer- 
landen. On the right section of this line (Laer to Neerwinden) 
the ground was much intersected and gave plenty of cover 
for both sides, and this section, being regarded as the key of 
the position, was strongly garrisoned; in the centre the open 
ground between Neerwinden and Neerlanden was solidly en- 
trenched, and in front of it Rumsdorp was held as an advanced 
post. The left at Neerlanden rested upon the Landen brook 
and was difficult of access. William's right, as his line of retreat 
lay over the Geete, was his dangerous flank, and Luxemburg 
was aware that, the front of the Allies being somewhat long for 
the numbers defending it, the intervention of troops drawn from 
one wing to reinforce the other would almost certainly be too 
late. Under these conditions Luxemburg's general plan was 
to throw the weight of his attack on the Laer-Neerwinden 
section, and specially on Neerwinden itself, and to economize 
his forces — as " economy of force " was understood before 
Napoleon's time — elsewhere, delivering holding attacks or 
demonstrations as might be necessary, and thus preventing

the Allied centre and left from assisting the right. Luxemburg 
had about 80,000 men to William's 50,000. Opposite the 
entrenchments of the centre he drew up nearly the whole of his 
cavalry in six lines, with two lines of infantry intercalated. 
A corps of infantry and dragoons was told off for the attack of 
Neerlanden and Rumsdorp, and the troops destined for the 
main attack, 28,000 of all arms, formed up in heavy masses 
opposite Neerwinden. This proportion of about one-third of 
the whole force to be employed in the decisive attack in the 
event proved insufficient. The troops opposite the Allied centre 
and left had to act with the greatest energy to fulfil their con- 
taining mission, and at Laer-Neerwinden the eventual success 
of the attack was bought only at the price of the utter exhaustion 
of the troops. 

After a long cannonade the French columns moved to the 
attack, converging on Neerwinden; a smaller force assaulted 
Laer. The edge of the villages was carried, but in the interior 
a murderous struggle began, every foot of ground being contested, 
and after a time William himself, leading a heavy counter-attack, 
expelled the assailants from both villages. A second attack, 
pushed with the same energy, was met with the same determina- 
tion, and meanwhile the French in other parts of the field had 
pressed their demonstrations home. Even the six lines of cavalry 
in the centre, after enduring the fire of the Allies for many hours, 
trotted over the open and up to the entrenchments to meet with 
certain defeat, and at Neerlanden and Rumsdorp there was 



342

severe hand to hand fighting. But, meantime, the two intact 
lines of infantry in the French centre had been moved to their 
left and formed the nucleus for the last great assault on Neer- 
winden, which proved too much for the exhausted defenders. 
They fell back slowly and steadily, defying pursuit, and the British 
Coldstream Guards even captured a colour. But at this crisis 
the initiative of a subordinate general, the famous military 
writer Feuquieres (?.v.), converted the hard- won local success 
into a brilliant victory. William had begun to move troops 
from his centre and left to the right in order to meet the great 
assault on Neerwinden, and Feuquieres, observing this, led the 
cavalry of the French centre once again straight at the en- 
trenchments. This time the French squadrons, surprising the 
Allies in the act of manoeuvring, rode over every body of troops 
they met, and nothing remained for the Allies but a hurried 
retreat over the Geete. A stubborn rearguard of British troops 
led by William himself alone saved the Allied army, of which 
all but the left wing was fought out and in disorder. Luxemburg 
had won his greatest victory, thanks in a measure to Feuquieres' 
exploit; but had the assaults on Neerwinden been made — 
as Napoleon would have made them — with one-half or two- 
thirds of his forces instead of one-third, the victory would have 
been decisive, and Feuquieres would have won his laurels, 
not in forcing the decision at the cost of using up his cavalry, 
but in annihilating the remnants of the Allied army in the 
pursuit. The material results of the battle were twelve thousand 
Allies (as against eight thousand French) killed, wounded and 
prisoners, and eighty guns and a great number of standards 
and colours taken by the French. 

The battle of the 18th March 1793 marked the end of Dumouriez's 
attempt to overrun the Low Countries and the beginning of the 
Allies' invasion of France. The Austrians under Coburg, advancing 
from Maestricht in the direction of Brussels, encountered the heads 
of the hurriedly assembling French army at Tirlemont on the 15th 
of March, and took up a position between Neerwinden and Neer- 
landen. On the 18th, however, after a little preliminary fighting 
Coburg drew back a short distance and rearranged his army on a 
more extended front between Racour and Dormael, thus parrying 
the enveloping movement begun by the French from Tirlemont. 
Dumouriez was consequently compelled to fight after all on parallel 
fronts, and though in the villages themselves the individuality and 
enthusiasm of the French soldier compensated for his inadequate 
training and indiscipline, the greater part of the front of contact was 
open ground, where the superiority of the veteran Austrian regulars 
was unchallengeable. In these conditions an attempt to win a second 
Jemappes with numerical odds of 11 to 10 instead of 2 to 1 in favour 
of the attack was foredoomed to disaster, and the repulse of the 
Revolutionary Army was the signal for its almost complete dis- 
solution. Neerwinden was a great disaster, but not a great battle. 
Its details merely show the impossibility of fighting on the 18th- 
century system with ill-trained troops. The methods by which such 
troops could compass victory, the way to .fight a " sans culotte " 
battle, were not evolved until later. 

NEES VON ESENBECK, CHRISTIAN GOTTFRIED (1776- 
1858), German botanist and entomologist, was born at Erbach 
on the 14th of February 1776, and was educated at Darmstadt 
and at Jena, where he took the degree of M.D. After spending 
some time in medical practice he was appointed professor of 
botany in Erlangen in 1816. Three years later he became 
professor of natural history in Bonn, and in 183 1 he was appointed 
to the chair of botany in the university of Breslau. In 1848 
he entered political life and made himself so obnoxious to the 
government that in 1851 he was deprived of his professorship, 
and in consequence the latter years of his life were spent in 
great poverty. He died in Breslau on the 16th of March 
1858. 

For about forty years he edited the Nova acta of the " Acad. 
Leopold-Carolina, ' in which several of his own papers were published. 
His earliest memoirs dealt with the ichneumons, and he published 
a Monographic der Ichneumone in 2 vols, in 1828, and Hymenopterorum 
Ichneumonibus affinium monographiae, in 2 vols, in 1834. "is other 
separate works include: Die Algen des sussen Wassers nach ihren 
Entwickelungsstufen dargestellt (1814); Das System der Ptlze und 
Schwamme (1816); Naturgesckichte der europaischen Lebermoose, in 
4 vols. (1833-1838); " Agrostologia Brasiliensis," in the Flora 
Brasiliensis; and a Systema Launnearum (1836). He also wrote 
numerous monographs in Flora, in Linnaea and in other scientific 
German magazines, either alone or along with other well-known 



botanists. His best-known works are those that deal with the 
Fungi, the Hepaticae and the Glumiferae, in all which groups he made 
valuable additions to knowledge. 

His brother THEOnOR Friedrich Ludwig (1787-1837), inspector 
of the botanic gardens at Leiden, and afterwards professor of 
pharmacy at Bonn, also wrote numerous papers on botanical sub- 
jects, dealing more particularly with medicinal plants and their 
products. 

NEFF, FELIX (179&-1829), Swiss Protestant divine and 
philanthropist, was born at Geneva on the 8th of October 
1798. Originally a sergeant of artillery, he decided in 181 9 to 
devote himself entirely to evangelistic work. He was ordained 
to the ministry in 1822, and soon afterwards settled in the valley 
of Freissinieres, where he laboured in the manner of J. F. 
Oberlin, being at one and the same time pastor, schoolmaster, 
engineer and agriculturist. He was so successful that he changed 
the character of the district and its inhabitants. In 1827, 
worn out by his labours, he was obliged to return to his native 
place, where he died two years later. 

NEGAPATAM, a seaport of British India, in the Tanjore 
district of Madras, forming one municipality with Nagore, 
a port 3 m. N. at the mouth of the Vettar river. Pop. (1901) 
57,190. It carries on a brisk trade with the Straits Settlements 
and Ceylon, steamers running once a week to Colombo. The 
chief export is rice. Negapatam is the terminus of a branch of 
the South Indian railway, and contains large railway workshops. 
It is also a depot for coolie emigration. Negapatam was one 
of the earliest settlements of the Protuguese on the Coromandel 
coast. It was taken by the Dutch in 1660, becoming their 
chief possession in India, and by the English in 1781. From 
1799 to n845 it was the headquarters of Tanjore district. There 
is a large population of Labbais, Mahommedans of mixed Arab 
descent, who are keen traders. Jesuit and Wesleyan missions 
are carried on. 

NEGAUNEE, a city of Marquette county, Michigan, U.S.A., 
about 12 m. W. by S. of Marquette and 3 m. E. of Ishpeming, 
in the N. part of the upper peninsula. Pop. (1904) 6797; (1910) 
8460. It is served by the Chicago & North-Wcstern, the Duluth, 
South Shore & Atlantic, and the Lake Superior & Ishpeming 
railways. It is built on a ridge called Iron Mountain, 1564 ft. 
above sea-level, and under and near it are some of the most 
productive iron-ore deposits in the state, the mining of which is 
the principal industry of the city. The settlement of Negaunee 
began about 1870, and the city was chartered in 1873. The 
name is a Chippewa word meaning " first " or " he goes before," 
and is said to have been chosen at the request of the Pioneer 
Iron Company as an equivalent for " Pioneer." 

NEGLIGENCE (Lat. negligenlia, from negligere, to neglect, 
literally " not to pick up "), a ground of civil law liability, and 
in criminal law an element in several offences, the most conspicu- 
ous of which is manslaughter by negligence. In order to establish 
civil liability on the ground of negligence, three things must be 
proved — a duty to take care, the absence of due care, and actual 
damage caused directly by the absence of due care. Mere care- 
lessness gives no right of action unless the person injured can 
show that there was a legal duty to take care. The duty may 
be to the public in general, on the ground that any person who 
does anything which may involve risk to the public is bound to 
take due care to avoid the risk. For instance, in the words of Lord 
Blackburn, " those who go personally or bring property where 
they know that they or it may come into collision with the 
persons or property of others have by law a duty cast upon 
them to use reasonable care and skill to avoid such a collision." 
Where a special duty to an individual is alleged, the duty must 
rest on a contract or undertaking or some similar specific ground. 
Thus, where a surveyor has carelessly given incorrect progress 
certificates, and a mortgagee who has had no contractual relation 
with the surveyor has advanced money on the faith of the 
certificate, the surveyor is not liable to the mortgagee in an action 
of negligence; because he owed no duty to the mortgagee to be 
careful. When a duty to take care is established, the degree of 
care required is now determined by a well-ascertained standard. 
This standard is the amount of care which would be exercised

in the circumstances by an " average reasonable man." This 
objective standard excludes consideration of the capacity or 
state of mind of the particular individual. It also gets rid of the 
old distinctions between " gross," " ordinary " and " slight " 
negligence, though no doubt the degree of care required varies 
with the circumstances of the case. The application of such a 
standard is a task for which a jury is a very appropriate tribunal. 
In fact the decision of the question whether there has been a 
want of due care is left almost unreservedly to the jury. There 
is this amount of control, that if the judge is of opinion that the 
evidence, if believed, cannot possibly be regarded as showing 
want of due care, or in technical language that tbere is "no 
evidence of negligence," it is his duty to withdraw the case from 
the jury and give judgment for the defendant. Unless the judge 
decides that there is no duty to take care, or that there is no 
evidence of want of care, the question of negligence or no negli- 
gence is wholly for tbe jury. 

Ordinarily a man is responsible only for his own negligence 
and for that of his servants and agents acting within the scope 
of their authority. For the acts or defaults of the servants of 
an independent contractor he is not liable. But in certain cases 
a stricter obligation is imposed on him by law. The occupier of 
premises is under a duty to all persons who go there on business 
which concerns him to see that the premises are in a reasonably 
safe condition so far as reasonable care and skill can make 
them so. Thus he cannot release himself by employing an in- 
dependent contractor to maintain or repair the premises. The 
effect of this doctrine is that the occupier may be liable if it can 
be shown that the independent contractor or his servant has been 
guilty of a want of due care. A similar obligation has been 
enforced in the case of a wreck stranded in a navigable river, 
and the owner was held liable for damage caused by the careless- 
ness of the servant of an independent contractor who had under- 
taken to light the wreck. So too any person who undertakes a 
work likely to cause danger if due care is not taken is liable for 
damage caused by the carelessness of the servant of an inde- 
pendent contractor, so long as the carelessness is not casual or 
collateral to the servant's employment. 

In an action of negligence a familiar defence is " contributory 
negligence." This is a rather misleading expression. It is not 
a sufficient defence to show that the plaintiff was negligent, 
and that his negligence contributed to the harm complained of. 
The plaintiff's negligence will not disentitle him to recover unless 
it is such that without it the misfortune would not have happened, 
nor if the defendant might by the exercise of reasonable care on 
his part have avoided the consequences of the plaintiff's 
negligence. The shortest and plainest way of expressing this 
rule is, that the plaintiff's negligence is no defence unless it was 
the proximate or decisive cause of the injury. There was an 
attempt in recent times to extend this doctrine so as to make 
the contributory negligence of a third person a defence, in cases 
* where the plaintiff, though not negligent himself, was travelling 
in a vehicle or vessel managed by the negligent third person, or 
was otherwise under his control. In such circumstances it was 
said that the plaintiff was " identified " with the third person. 
QVaUc v. North-Eastern Ry. Co., 1858, E. B. & E., 719). This 
case, in the Exchequer Chamber, was an action on behalf of 
an infant by his next friend. The infant, which was five years 
of age, was with its grandmother, who took a half-ticket for 
the child and a ticket for herself to travel by the defendants' 
line; as they were crossing the railway to be ready for the 
train the child was injured by a passing train. The jury found 
that the defendants were guilty of negligence, and that the 
grandmother was guilty of negligence which contributed to the 
accident, while there was no negligence of the infant plaintiff. 
A verdict was entered for the plaintiff, but in the Queen's 
Bench the verdict was entered for the defendants, without 
calling on them to argue, on the ground that the infant was 
identified with its •grandmother. But the case of the 
"Bernina," decided in 1888, where a passenger and an engineer 
on board the " Bushire " were killed in a collision between the 
" Bernina " and the " Bushire " caused by fault in both ships, 



but without fault on the part of the deceased, exploded this 
supposed doctrine, and made it clear that the defence of 
contributory negligence holds good only when the defendant 
contends and proves that the plaintiff was injured by his own 
carelessness. 

The American law of negligence is founded on the English 
common law; but the decisions in different states have occasion- 
ally contradicted English decisions, and also one another.

NEGRI, ADA (1870- ), Italian poet, was born at Lodi, of an 
artisan family, and became a village school-teacher. Her first 
book of poems, Tempeste (1891), tells the helpless tragedy of the 
forsaken poor, in words of vehement beauty. Her second volume 
of lyrics, Fatalita (1893), confirmed her reputation as a poet, and 
led to her appointment to the normal school at Milan; but her 
later verse, while striking in its sincerity, suffered by a tendency 
to repetition and consequent mannerism. 

NEGRITOS (Span, for " little negroes "), the name originally 
giveu by the Spaniards to the aborigines of the Philippine Islands. 
They are physical weaklings, of low, almost dwarf, stature, with 
very dark skin, closely curling hair, flat noses, thick lips and 
large clumsy feet. The term has, however, been more generally 
applied to one of the great ethnic groups into which the popula- 
tion of the East Indies is divided, and to an apparently kindred 
race in Africa (see Negro). A. de Quatrefages suggests that 
from the parent negroid stem were thrown off two negrito 
branches to the west and east, the Indo-Oceanic and African, 
and that the Akkas, Wochuas, Bat was and Bushmen of the 
Dark Continent are kinsmen of the Andaman Islanders, the 
Sakais of the Malay Peninsula and the Aetas of the Philippines. 
This view has found much acceptance among ethnologists. The 
result of Quatrefages's theory would be to place the negrito 
races closest to the primitive human type, a conclusion apparently 
justified by their physical characteristics. The true negritos 
are always of little stature (the majority under 5 ft.), have 
rounded forms and their skull is brachycephalic or subbrachy- 
cephalic, that is to say, it is relatively short and broad and of 
little height. Their skin is dark brown or black, sometimes 
somewhat yellowish, their hair woolly (scanty on face and body), 
and they have the flat nose and thick lips and other physical 
features of the negro. Among peoples undoubtedly negrito 
are those of the Andaman Islands (g.fl.), the Malay Peninsula 
(q.v.) and some of the Philippines (g.tf.), the best types being 
the Sakais (q.v.) t Mincopies and Aetas. The question of tbe so- 
called negrito races of India, the Oraons, Gonds, &c, is in much 
dispute, Quatrefages believing the Indian aborigines to have 
been negritos, while other ethnologists find the primitive people 
of Hindustan in the Dravidian races. Some authorities have 
placed the Veddahs of Ceylon among the negritos, but their 
straight hair and dolichocephalic skulls are sufficient arguments 
against their inclusion. The negrito is often confounded with 
the Papuan; but the latter, though possessing the same woolly 
hair and being of the same colour, is a large, often muscular man, 
with a long, high skull.

NEGRO 



NEGRO (from Lat. niger, black), in anthropology, the designa- 
tion of the distinctly dark-skinned, as opposed to the fair, yellow, 
and brown variations of mankind. In its widest sense it embraces 
all the dark races, whose original home is the intertropical and 
sub-tropical regions of the eastern hemisphere, stretching 
roughly from Senegambia, West Africa, to the Fijian Islands in 
the Pacific, between the extreme parallels of the Philippines 
and Tasmania. It is most convenient, however, to refer to the 
dark-skinned inhabitants of this zone by the collective term of 
Negroids, and to reserve the word Negro for the tribes which 
are considered to exhibit in the highest degree the characteristics 
taken as typical of the variety. 

These tribes are found in Africa; their home being south of 
the Sahara and north of a not very well-defined line running 
roughly from the Gulf of Biafra with a south-easterly trend 
across the equator to the mouth of the Tana. In this tract 
are found the true negroes; and their nearest relatives, the 
Bantu-negroids, are found to the south of the last-mentioned 
line. The relation of the yellowish-brown Bushman and Hotten- 
tot peoples of the southern extremity of Africa to the negro is 
uncertain; they possess certain negroid characters, the tightly 
curled hair, the broad nose, the tendency towards prognathism; 
but their colour and a number of psychological and cultural 
differences would seem to show that the relation is not close. 
Between the two a certain affinity seems to exist, and the 
Hottentot is probably the product of an early intermixture of 
the first Hamito-Bantu immigrants with the Bushman aborigines 
(see Africa: Ethnology). The relation of the negroids of Africa 
to those of Asia (southern India and Malaysia) and Australasia 
cannot be discussed with profit owing to lack of evidence; still 
less the theories which have been put forward to account for 
the wide dispersal from what seems to be a single stock. It will 
be sufficient to say that the two groups have in common a 
number of well-defined characteristics of which the following 
are the chief: A dark skin, varying from dark brown> reddish- 
brown, or chocolate to nearly black; dark tightly curled hair, 
flat in transverse section, 1 of the " woolly " or the " frizzly " 
type; a greater or less tendency to prognathism; eyes dark 
brown with yellowish cornea; nose more or less broad and flat; 
and large teeth. 

Sharing these characteristics, but distinguished by short 
stature and brachycephaly, is a group to which the name Negrito 
(q.v.) has been given; with this exception the tendency among 
the negroids appears to be towards tall stature and doiichoce- 
phaly in proportion as they approach the pure negro type. As 
the most typical representatives of the variety are found in 
Africa, the Asiatic and Australasian negroids may be dismissed 
with this introduction. The negro and negroid population of 
America, the descendants of the slaves imported from West 
Africa, and in a less degree, from the Mozambique coast, before 
the abolition of the slave-trade, are treated separately below. 

In Africa three races have intermingled to a certain extent 
with the negro; the Libyans (Berbers: q.v.) in the Western 
Sudan; and the Hamitic races (q.v.) and Arabs (q.v.) in the east. 
The identity of the people who have amalgamated with the 
negro to form the Bantu-speaking peoples in the southern portion 
of the continent is not certain, but as the latter appear to ap- 
proach the Hamites in those characteristics in. which they differ 
from the true negroes, it seems probable that they are infused 
with a proportion of Hamitic blood. The true negroes show great 
similarity of physical characteristics ; besides those already 
mentioned they are distinguished by length of arm, especially 
of fore arm, length of leg, smallness of calf and projection of heel; 
characteristics which frequently fail to appear to the same degree 

1 This point has been fully determined by P. A. Brown (Classifica- 
tion of Mankind by the Hair, &c), who shows conclusively that, 
unlike true hair and like true wool, the negro hair is flat, issues from 
the epidermis at a right angle, is spirally twisted or crisped, has no 
central duct, the colouring matter being disseminated through the 
cortex and intermediate fibres, while the cortex itself is covered with 
numerous rough, pointed filaments adhering loosely to the shaft; 
lastly, the negro pile will felt, like wool, whereas true hair cannot be 
felted. 



among the Bantu, who are also as a rule less tall, less prognathous, 
less platyrrhine and less dark. A few tribes in the heart of the 
negro domain (the Welle district of Belgian Congo) show a 
tendency to round head, shorter stature and fairer complexion; 
but there seems reason to suppose that they have received an 
infusion of Libyan (or less probably Hamitic) or Negrito blood. 

The colour of the skin, which is also distinguished by a velvety 
surface and a characteristic odour, is due not to the presence of 
any special pigment, but to the greater abundance of the colour- 
ing matter in the Malpighian mucous membrane between the 
inner or true skin and the epidermis or scarf skin. 2 This colouring 
matter is not distributed equally over the body, and does not 
reach its fullest development until some weeks after birth; 
so that new-born babies are a reddish chocolate or copper colour. 
But excess of pigmentation is not confined to the skin; spots 
of pigment are often found in some of the internal organs, such 
as the liver, spleen, &c. Other characteristics appear to be a 
hypertrophy of the organs of excretion, a more developed venous 
system, and a less voluminous brain, as compared with the 
white races. 

In certain of the characteristics mentioned above the negro 
would appear to stand on a lower evolutionary plane than the 
white man, and to be more closely related to the highest anthro- 
poids. The characteristics are length of arm, prognathism, 
a heavy massive cranium with large zygomatic arches, flat nose 
depressed at base, &c. But in one important respect, the 
character of the hair,, the white man stands in closer relation 
to the higher apes than does the Negro. 

Mentally the negro is inferior to the white. The remark of 
F. Manetta, made after a long study of the negro in America, 
may be taken as generally true of the whole race: " the negro 
children were sharp, intelligent and full of vivacity, but on 
approaching the adult period a gradual change set in. The 
intellect seemed to become clouded, animation giving place 
to a sort of lethargy, briskness yielding to indolence. We must 
necessarily suppose that the development of the negro and white 
proceeds on different lines. While with the latter the volume of 
the brain grows with the expansion of the brainpan, in the 
former the growth of the brain is on the contrary arrested by 
the premature closing of the cranial sutures and lateral pressure 
of the frontal bone. 3 This explanation is reasonable and even 
probable as a contributing cause; but evidence is lacking on the 
subject and the arrest or even deterioration in mental develop- 
ment is no doubt very largely due to the fact that after puberty 
sexual matters take the first place in the negro's life and thoughts. 
At the same time his environment has not been such as would tend 
to produce in him the restless energy which has led to the progress 
of the white race; and the easy conditions of tropical life and 
the fertility of the soil have reduced the struggle for existence 
to a minimum. But though the mental inferiority of the negro 
to [the white or yellow races is a fact, it has often been ex- 
aggerated; the negro is largely the creature of his environment, ' 

2 It is also noteworthy that the dark colour seems to depend neither 
on geographical position, the isothermals of greatest heat, nor even 
altogether on racial purity. The extremes of the chromatic scale are 
found in juxtaposition throughout the whole negro domain, in Sene- 
gambia, the Gabun, upper Nile basin, lower Congo, Shari valley, 
Mozambique. ^ In the last region M de Froberville determined the 
presence of thirty-one different shades from dusky or yellow-brown 
to sooty black. Some of the sub- negroid and mixed races, such as 
many Abyssinians, Galla, Jolof and Mandingo, are quite as black as 
the darkest full-blood negro. A general similarity in the outward 
conditions of soil, atmosphere, climate, food charged with an excess 
of carbon, such as the fruit of the butter-tree, and other undetermined 
causes have tended to develop a tendency towards dark shades every- 
where in the negro domain apart from the bias mainly due to an 
original stain of black blood. Perhaps the most satisfactory theory 
explains the excessive development of pigment in the dark-skinned 
races as a natural protection against the ultra-violet rays in which 
tropical light is so rich and which are destructive of protoplasm 
(see C. E. Woodruff, Tropical Light, London, 1905). The expression 
" jet black " is applied by Schweinfurth to the upper-Nilotic Shilluk, 
Nuer and Dinka, while the neighbouring Bongo and Mittu are de- 
scribed as of a " red-brown " colour "like the soil upon which they 
reside " (Heart of Africa, vol. i. ch. iv.).

and it is not fair to judge of his mental capacity by tests taken 
directly from the environment of the white man, as for instance 
tests in mental arithmetic; skill in reckoning is necessary to the 
white race, and it has cultivated this faculty; but it is not 
necessary to the negro. 

On the other hand negroes far surpass white men in acuteness 
of vision, hearing, sense of direction and topography. A native 
who has once visited a particular locality will rarely fail to 
recognize it again. For the rest, the mental constitution of the 
negro is very similar to that of a child, normally good-natured 
and cheerful, but subject to sudden fits of emotion and passion 
during which he is capable of performing acts of singular atrocity, 
impressionable, vain, but often exhibiting in the capacity of 
servant a dog-like fidelity which has stood the supreme test. 
Given suitable training, the negro is capable of becoming a 
craftsman of considerable skill, particularly in metal work, 
carpentry and carving. The bronze castings by the cire perdue 
process, and the cups and horns of ivory elaborately carved, 
which were produced by the natives of Guinea after their 
intercourse with the Portuguese of the 16th century, bear ample 
witness to this. But the rapid decline and practical evanescence 
of both industries, when that intercourse was interrupted, shows 
that the native craftsman was raised for the moment ^above his 
normal level by direct foreign inspiration, and was unable to 
sustain the high quality of his work when that inspiration failed. 

In speaking of the form or forms of culture found among negro 
and negroid tribes, the dependence of the native upon his 
environment must be kept in mind, particularly in Africa, where 
interchange of customs is continually taking place among 
neighbours. 

Thus the forest regions are distinguished by a particular form 
of culture which differs from that prevailing in the more open 
country (see Africa: Ethnology). But it may be said generally 
that the negro is first and foremost an agriculturist. The negritcs 
are on a lower cultural plane; they are nomadic hunters who 
do no cultivation whatever. Next in importance to agriculture 
come hunting and fishing and, locally, cattle-keeping. The 
last isno't strictly typical of negro culture at all; nearly all the 
tribes by whom it is practised are of mixed origin, and their 
devotion to cattle seems to vary inversely with the purity of race. 
The most striking exception to this statement is the Dinka of 
the upper Nile, the whole of whose existence centres round the 
cattle pen. Of the other tribes where pastoral habits obtain to 
a greater or less extent, the Masai have a large percentage of 
Hamitic blood, the eastern and southern Bantu-speaking negroids 
are also of mixed descent, &c. 

The social conditions are usually primitive, especially among 
the negroes proper, being based on the. village community ruled 
by a chief. Where the country is open, or where the forest 
is not so thick as to present any great obstacle to communication, 
it has often happened that a chief has extended his rule over 
several villages and has ultimately built up a kingdom adminis- 
tered by sub-chiefs of various grades, and^has even established 
a court with a regular hierarchy of officials. - Benin and Dahomey 
are instances of this. But the region * where this " empire- 
building " has reached its greatest proportions lies to the south 
of the forest belt in the territory of the Bantu negroids, where 
arose the states of Lunda, Cazembe, &c. 

The domestic life of the negro is based upon polygyny, and 
marriage is almost always by purchase. So vital is polygyny to 
the native social system that the attempts made by missionaries 
to abolish plurality of wives would, if successful (a contingency 
unthinkable under present conditions), result in the most serious 
social disorder. Not only would an enormous section of the 
population be deprived of all means of support, but the native 
wife would be infinitely harder worked; agriculture, the task of 
the women, would be at a standstill; and infanticide would 
probably assume dangerous proportions. 

Descent in the negro world is on the whole more often reckoned 
through the female, though many tribes with a patriarchal, 
system are found. Traces of totemism arc found sporadically, 
but are rare. 



Of the highest importance socially are the secret societies, 
which are found in their highest development among the negroes 
of the west coast, and in a far less significant form among some 
of the Bantu negroids of the western forest district. In their 
highest form these societies transcend the tribal divisions, and the 
tie which binds the individual to the society takes precedence of 
all others. But the secret society cannot be called a definitely 
negro institution, since it is found in the west only. 

As an agriculturist the negro is principally a vegetarian, 
but this form of diet is not the result of direct choice; meat is 
everywhere regarded as a great delicacy, and no opportunity 
of obtaining it is ever neglected, with one exception — that the 
cattle-keeping tribes rarely slaughter for food, because cattle 
are a form of currency. Fish is also an important article of diet 
in the neighbourhood of large rivers, especially the Nile and 
Congo. It is worthy of note that the two cultivated plants 
which form the mainstay of native life, manioc in the west and 
centre and mealies in the south and east, are neither of African 
origin. 

Cannibalism is found in its simplest form in Africa. In that 
continent the majority of cannibal tribes eat human flesh because 
they like it, and not from any magical motive or from lack of 
other animal food. In fact it is noticeable that the tribes most 
addicted to this practice inhabit just those districts where game 
is most plentiful. Among the true negroes it is confined mainly 
to the Welle and Ubangi districts, though found sporadically (and 
due to magical motives) on the west coast, and among the Bantu 
negroids in the south-western part of Belgian Congo and the 
Gabun. 

With regard to crafts the most important and typical is that 
of iron smelting and working. No negro tribe has been found 
of which the culture is typical of the Stone age; or, indeed, 
which makes any use of stone implements except to crush ore 
and hammer metal. Even these are rough pieces of stone of 
convenient size, not shaped in any way by chipping or grinding. 
Doubtless the richness of the African soil in metal ores rendered 
the Stone age in Africa a period of very short duration (see 
Africa: Ethnology). A good deal of aptitude is shown in the 
forging of iron, considering the primitive nature of the tools. 
Considerable skill in carving is also found in the west and among 
the Bantu negroids, especially of Belgian Congo south of the 
Congo. Weaving is practised to a large extent in the west; 
the true native material being palm-leaf fibre. The cultivation 
of cotton, which has become important in West Africa, deals 
with an exotic material and has been subjected to foreign 
influences. Among the Bantu of the Kasai district the art of 
weaving palm-cloth reaches its highest level, and in the east 
cot ton- weaving is again found. Pottery-making is almost uni- 
versal, though nowhere has it reached a very advanced stage; the 
wheel is unknown, though an appliance used on the lower Congo 
displays the principle in very rudimentary form. The produc- 
tion of fire by means of friction was universal, the method known 
as " twirling " being in vogue, i.e. the rapid rotation between 
the palms of a piece of hard wood upon a piece of soft wood. 

Trading is practised either by direct barter or through the 
medium of rude forms of currency which vary according to 
locality. Value is reckoned among the tribes with pastoral 
tendencies in cattle and goats; among the eastern negroes 
by hoe-and spear-blades and salt blocks; in the west by cowries, 
brass rods, and bronze armlets (manilas); in Belgian Congo 
variously by olivella shells, brass rods, salt, goats and fowls, 
copper ingots and iron spear-blades, &c. 

As regards religion, the question of environment is again 
important; in the western forests where communities are small 
the negro is a fetishist, though his fetishism is often combined 
more or less with nature worship. Where communication is 
easier the nature worship becomes more systematic, and definite 
supernatural agencies are recognized, presiding over definite 
spheres of human life. 1 Where feudal kingdoms have been formed, 
ancestor- worship begins to appear and often assumes paramount

graphy form an excellent study of the development of negro religion.

importance. In fact this form of religion is typical of all the 
eastern and southern portion of the continent (see Africa: 
Ethnology). With the negro, as with most primitive peoples, 
it is the malignant powers which receive attention from man, 
with a view to propitiation or coercion. Beneficent agencies 
require no attention, since, from their very nature, they must 
continue to do good. The negro attitude towards the super- 
natural is based frankly on fear; gratitude plays no part in it. 
A characteristic feature of the western culture area, among both 
negro and Bantu negroid tribes, is the belief that any form of 
death except by violence must be due to evil magic exercised 
by, or through the agency of, some human individual; to dis- 
cover the guilty party the poison ordeal is freely used. A 
similar form of ordeal is found in British Central Africa, to dis- 
cover magicians, and the wholesale " smelling-out " of " witches," 
often practised for political reasons, is a well-known feature 
of the culture of the Zulu-Xosa tribes. Everywhere magic, 
both sympathetic and imitative, is practised, both by the ordinary 
individual and by professional magicians, and most medical 
treatment is based on this, althou'gh the magician is usually a 
herbalist of some skill. Where the rainfall is uncertain, the 
production of rain by magical means is one of the chief duties 
of the magician, a duty which becomes paramount in the eastern 
plains among negroes and Bantu negroids alike. But the negroes 
and negroids have been considerably influenced by exotic 
religions, chiefly by Mahommedanism along the whole extent 
of country bordering the Sahara and in the east. Christianity 
has made less progress, and the reason is not far to seek. Islam 
is simple, categorical and easily comprehended; it tends far 
less to upset the native social system, especially in the matter 
of polygyny, and at the same time discourages indulgence in 
strong drink. Moreover the number of native missionaries is 
considerable. Christianity has none of these advantages, but 
possesses two great drawbacks as far as the negro is concerned. 
It is not sufficiently categorical, but leaves too much to the 
individual, and it discountenances polygyny. The fact that it 
is divided into sects, more or less competitive among them- 
selves, is another disadvantage which can hardly be overrated. 
This division has not, it is true, as yet had much influence upon 
the evangelization of Africa, since the various missions have 
mostly restricted themselves each to a particular sphere; still, 
it is a defect in Christianity, as compared with Islam, which will 
probably make itself felt in Africa as it has in China. 

As regards language, the Bantu negroids all speak dialects of 
one tongue (see Bantu Languages). Among the negroes the 
most extraordinary linguistic confusion prevails, half a dozen 
neighbouring villages in a -small area often speaking each a 
separate language. All are of the agglutinating order. No 
absolutely indigenous form of script exists; though the Hausa 
tongue has been reduced to writing without European assistance. 1

Negroes in the United Stales. 

After the migration of the European fair-skinned races in 
large numbers to other parts of the earth occupied by people 
of darker colour, the adjustment of relations between the diverse 
races developed a whole series of problems almost unknown 
to the ancient world or to the life of modern Europe. The wider 
the diversity of physique and especially of skin colour, the greater 
the danger of friction. The more serious the effort to secure 
industrial and social co-operation under representative institu- 
tions, the graver have become the difficulties. They have been 
and are perhaps more acute in the United States than elsewhere,

the first half of the 19th century, owed its inspiration to European 
influence, and of the characters " many . . . are clumsy adaptations

because there the lightest and the darkest races have com- 
mingled, because of the theory on which the government of the 
country nominally rests,, that each freeman should be given 
an equal chance to improve his industrial position and an equal 
voice in deciding political questions, and because of the almost 
irreconcilable differences in the public opinion of the two great 
sections to only one of which do the problems come home as 
everyday matters. They were not solved by the Civil War 
and emancipation, but their nature was radically altered. Neither 
the earlier system of slavery nor the governmental theory during 
the radical reconstruction period that race differences should 
be ignored has proved workable, and the trend is now towards 
some modus vivendi between these extremes. 

The only definition of negro having any statutory basis in 
the United States is that given in the legislation of many Southern 
states prohibiting intermarriage between a white person and 
" a person who has one-eighth or more of African blood." 
Census enumerators in their counts of the American people 
since 1790 have distinguished the two main races of whites and 
negroes, but in so doing they have never been given a definition 
or criterion of race. Consequently they followed the judgment 
of the community enumerated, which usually classes as negro 
all persons known or believed to have in their veins any ad- 
mixture of negro blood. It is probable that this line, the so- 
called " colour line," which is emphasized in regions where 
negroes are numerous by many legal, economic and social dis- 
criminations between the races, is drawn with substantial 
accuracy. Far different has been the result of governmental 
efforts to draw another line within the group of negroes as thus 
defined, that between the negroes of pure African blood and those 
of mixed negro and white blood. This distinction has no legal 
significance, for negroes of pure blood and negroes of mixed blood 
are subject to the same provisions of law, and at least for the 
whites it has little social or economic significance. An attempt 
to draw it was made at each census betweeen 1850 and 1890 
inclusive, and the results, so far as they were published, indicate 
that between one-sixth and one-ninth of the negroes in the United 
States have some admixture of white blood. The figures were 
reached through thousands of -census enumerators, nearly all 
of whom were white. Of recent years an effort has been made 
on the part of negro investigators to get an answer to the same 
question by the careful study of communities selected as typical. 
The classification of about 39,000 coloured people, most of them 
in different parts of Georgia, with a study of the other available 
data and inferences from a somewhat wide observation, led Dr 
Dubois to the conclusion that " at least one-third of the negroes 
of the United States have recognizable traces of white blood." 

Perhaps we may believe with some confidence that the in- 
formation from white sources understates, and that from negro 
sources overstates, the proportion, and that the true proportion 
cf mulattoes in the United States is between one-sixth and one- 
third of all negroes. To infer that the true proportion in 1850, 
i860, 1870 and 1890, the dates to which the census figures relate, 
was much less than the true proportion in 1895 to 1900, to which 
the unofficial figures relate, is contrary to the general trend of 
the evidence. As the law and the social opinion of the Southern 
whites make little or nothing of this distinction between negroes 
of pure blood and mulattoes, it is often regarded as less important 
than it really is. The recognized leaders of the race are almost 
invariably persons of mixed blood, and the qualities which have 
made them leaders are derived certainly in part and perhaps 
mainly from their white ancestry. Wherever large numbers 
of full-blooded negroes and of persons of mixed central or north 
European and negro blood have lived in the same community 
for some generations, there is a strong and growing tendency 
to establish a social line between them. 

The difficulty of ascertaining the number of mulattoes in 
the United States and the tendency of the testimony to be 
modified by the opinion or desire of the race from which it comes 
are typical. There is hardly any important aspect of the subject 
upon which the testimony of seemingly competent and impartial 
witnesses is not materially affected by the influence of the race 



NEGRO 



347 



to which the witnesses belong. Under these circumstances it 
seems necessary to assume that the testimony of the official 
documents of the federal government is correct, unless clear 
evidence, internal or external, refutes it. The following state- 
ments of fact rest mainly on those sources. 

The number of negroes living in the (continental) United 
States in 1908 was about nine and three-quarter millions, and 
if those in Porto Rico and Cuba be included it reached ten and 
two-thirds millions. This number is greater than the total 
population of the United States was in 1820, and nearly as great 
as the population of Norway, Sweden and Denmark. 

During the colonial period, and down to the changes initiated 
by the invention of the cotton gin, negroes were distributed 
with some evenness along the Atlantic coast. Between the date 
of that invention and the Civil War, and largely as a result of 
the changes the cotton gin set in motion, the tendency was to- 
wards a concentration of the negroes in the great cotton-growing 
area of the country. In 1700, for example, one-ninth of the 
population of the colony of New York was negro; in 1900 only 
one-seventieth of the population of the empire state belonged 
to that race. The division line between the Northern and 
Southern states adopted by the Census Office in 1880, and em- 
ployed since that date in its publications, is Mason and Dixon's 
line, or the southern boundary of Pennsylvania, the Ohio river 
from Pennsylvania to its mouth and the southern boundary of 
Missouri and Kansas. In the states north of that line, the 
Northern states, in all of which but Missouri negro slavery either 
never existed or else was abolished before the Civil War, the 
white population increased tenfold and the negro population 
only fourfold between 1790 and i860. In the states south of 
that line, on the contrary, the Southern states, the negro popula- 
tion in the same period increased sixfold and the white population 
not so fast. It was a widespread opinion shortly after the Civil 
War that the emancipated slaves would speedily disperse through 
the country, and that this process would greatly simplify the 
problems arising from the contact of the two races. This expec- 
tation has not been entirely falsified by the result. Between 
i860 and 1900 the negroes in the Northern states increased 
somewhat more rapidly than the northern whites, and those 
in the Southern states much less rapidly than the Southern 
whites. As a result, one-tenth of the American negroes lived 
in 1908 in the Northern states, a larger proportion than at any 
time during the 19th century. But this process of dispersion 
is so slow as not materially to affect the prospects for the im- 
mediate future, and it is still almost as true as at any earlier 
date that the region in which cotton is a staple crop coincides 
in the main with the region in which negroes are more than one- 
half of the total population. 

This appears if a comparison is made between the northern 
boundary of the so-called Austroriparian zone of plant and animal 
life in the United States, that is " the zone of the cotton plant, 
sugar cane, rice, pecan and peanut," and the northern boundary 
of the " black belt " or region in which the negroes are a majority 
of the population. The coincidence of the two is very close, 
and was much closer in 1900 than* in i860. It appears yet more 
clearly by a comparison between a map showing the counties 
in which at least 5% of the area was planted to cotton in 1899 
and another map showing the " black belt " counties in 1900. 
, The black belt stretches north through eastern Virginia beyond 
the cotton belt, and the cotton belt stretches south-west through 
eastern central Texas beyond the black belt, but between these 
two extremes there is a close agreement in the boundaries of the 
two areas. 

The question " Have the American negroes progressed, materi- 
ally and morally, since emancipation?" is generally answered 
in the affirmative. But even on this question entire unanimity 
is lacking. A considerable body of men could still be found 
in 1910, mainly among Southern whites, who held that the con- 
dition of the race was worse than it was in the days of slavery. 
Probably all competent students would admit, however, that 
the race has differentiated since 1865, that the distance separating 
the highest tenth from the lowest tenth has become wider, that 



the highest tenth is far better and far better off than formerly, 
and the lowest tenth is worse and perhaps also worse off than 
in slavery. Under such circumstances there are no adequate 
objective tests of progress. The pessimist points to the alleged 
increase of idleness and crime, the meliorist to a demonstrated 
decrease of illiteracy and to considerable accumulations of 
property. The large majority of competent students believe 
that the American negroes have progressed, materially and 
morally, since emancipation, that the central or average 
point is higher than in 1865, although such persons differ 
widely among themselves regarding the amount of that 
progress. 

It would be generally but not universally held, also, that 
the negroes in the United States progressed under slavery, 
that they were far better qualified for incorporation as a vital 
and contributing element of the country's civilization at the 
time of their emancipation than they were on arrival or than 
an equal number of their African kindred would have been. 
But probably the rate of progress has been more rapid under 
freedom than it was under slavery. 

The evidence regarding the progress of the American 
negro may be grouped under the following heads: numbers, 
birth-rate, health, wealth, education, occupations, morals, 
citizenship. 

Numbers, — The dictum of Adam Smith, " The most decisive mark 
of the prosperity of any country is the increase of the number of its 
inhabitants," may be applied, perhaps after changing the word 
" decisive " to " obvious," to the nepro population of the United 
States. The negro population of Africa is probably not increasing 
at all. But during the 19th century the negroes in the United States 
increased nearly ninefold. They are now much the most thriving 
offshoot of the race and the most civilized and progressive group of 
negroes in the world. Under a slavery system not permitting the 
importation of new supplies a high rate of increase by excess of 
births over deaths is an advantage to the master class. During the 
slavery period and until about 1880 the increase of southern whites 
and of southern negroes proceeded at about the same rate. But 
during the last score of years in the century the increase of negroes 
was much less rapid, the rate being only about three-fifths of that 
prevailing among southern whites. 

Birth-rate. — As the increase of negro population is slackening, as 
the immigration and emigration of negroes are insignificant in 
amount, and as the death-rate is about stationary, it is reasonable to 
infer that the birth-rate is dwindling. This cannot be stated with 
certainty, for there arc no registration records giving the number of 
births for any large and representative group of American negroes. 
A good index to the birth-rate, however, may be derived from the 
proportion of children under 5 years of age to women 15 to 49 years 
of age. In the returns negroes are not distinguished from Indians 
and Mongolians. To minimize this slight source of error and at the 
same time to secure a more representative and homogeneous popu- 
lation group, the following figures are confined to the Southern or 
former slave states : —

These figures indicate that the proportion of children to child- 
bearing women, and hence probably the birth-rate, changed in the 
same direction during each decade between 1850 and 1890. Between 
1850 and 1870 the proportion of negro children decreased about 6% 
and that of white children about 14%; between 1870 and 1880 the 
proportion of negro children increased about 12% and that of white 
children about 9%; between 1880 and 1890 the proportion of negro 
children decreased about 18 % and that of white children about 12 %; 
between 1890 and 1900 the proportion of negro children decreased 
about 4% and that of white children remained practically the same. 
Before the war the proportion of living children to potential mothers 
was about the same for the two races at the South, for the first three 
censuses after the war the proportion of negro children was much 
greater than of white children, but by 1900 that proportion was less, 
and the movement during the decade suggests that the proportions 
may have begun to change in opposite directions.

The noteworthy inference from these figures is that the proportion 
of negro children in southern cities was very low and decreasing. 
In 1890 it was about five-sixths, and in 1900 less than three-fourths 
of the proportion of children among whites in these cities. The 
differences in northern cities are equally marked. City life appears to 
exercise a powerful and increasing influence in reducing the birth- 
rate among the negroes. 

Health, — The prosperity and progress of a population group are 
indicated, not merely by growth in numbers but also by the longevity 
of its members. This vitality is roughly measured by the death-rate. 
Other things being equal, a low and sinking death-rate is evidence 
of a high and increasing average duration of life. In the United 
States vital statistics are in charge of the several states and cities, 
and are often defective or entirely lacking. In 1890 and 1900 the 
Federal government compiled such as were of importance, and in 
1864 an official compilation was made of death-rates of negroes 
before the war. The results are worth consideration.

These figures indicate that the death-rate of each race decreased 
during a half century, but that the decrease among negroes was 
much less rapid than among whites. The negro death-rate at the 
earliest period exceeded that of the whites by 8*0 per thousand, or 
three-tenths of the smaller rate. At the latest period the difference 
was 12-3 per thousand, or seven-tenths of the smaller rate. But 
these figures speak for negroes living mainly in cities where the 
proportion of children and elderly persons is small and that of negroes 
at the healthy ages is large. After making a proper allowance for 
these differences in sex and age composition, it is found that the true 
death-rate of negroes in the registration area is about twice as high 
as that of a white population of like sex and age structure. Whether 
the difference between negro and white residents of the country 
districts in the south is equally great, we have no means for 
judging. 

The leading causes of death among negroes in the registration area 
arranged in the order of importance are stated below. The ratio to 
the corresponding death-rate among whites is added, but the differ- 
ences are affected partly by the greater proportion of negroes in the 
southern cities and the different incidence of diseases in the two 
regions^ and partly by probable differences in the accuracy of 
diagnosis of disease in the two sections and by physicians attending 
the two races.

These figures bring out in a striking way the very high mortality, 
absolute and relative, of the American negro from consumption. 



When one considers both the great number of deaths caused by 
consumption and pneumonia, 28*4% of the deaths from all causes 
in 1900 and the very high death-rate of negroes from these diseases, 
it is no exaggeration to say that the main cause that the death-rate 
of that race is double that of the white race lies in the ravages of 
these two scourges of mankind. The difference between the two 
races in this respect has apparently increased since 1890, for at that 
date the death-rate of negroes in the registration area from con- 
sumption was only 2*37 times that of the whites, and its death-rate 
from pneumonia only 1*53 times that of the whites. Here as else- 
where there has been an improvement as measured by an absolute 
standard, and at the same time an increased divergence from the 
conditions prevailing among the more numerous race. 

Wealth. — An estimate of the property now held by American 
negroes made in 1904 by a committee of the American Economic 
Association indicated about $300,000,000, with a probable error of 
perhaps $50,000,000. This figure indicates a per capita wealth of 
about $34. We have no means for judging what the possessions of 
the race were at the time of its emancipation, but in i860 there were 
nearly half a million free negroes in the country, many of them 
holding property and some of them wealthy. The per capita wealth 
of the white population of the United States in 1900 was about 
$1320 and that of southern whites about $885, indicating that 
the property of the average negro person or family was about 
one twenty-fifth that of the average southern white person or 
family. 

Education, — It is often supposed that the American negroes in 
1865 were without any accumulated property and without any start 
in education. Neither assumption is warranted. On the contrary, 
about two-fifths of the adult free negroes in the country were reported 
in 1850 and i860 as able to read and write, and there is some reason 
to believe that not far from one-twelfth of the adult slaves also had 
learned to write. In ioxx) more than half of the negroes at least ten 
years of age could write, and the proportion was rising at a rate 
which, if continued, would almost eliminate illiteracy by the middle 
of the present century ^ 

The problem of providing adequate educational facilities for negro 
children is made more difficult by the maintenance in all the former 
slave states of two sets of schools, one for each race. At the present 
time those states with one-third of their population negro assign 
about one-fifth of their public school funds to the support of negro 
schools. About $155,000,000 or one-sixth of the entire amount 
spent by southern communities for public schools between 1870 and 
1906, has gone to support schools for the negroes. The same cause 
has^ been aided by many private gifts from individuals and organi- 
zations interested in negro education, among which the Peabpdy 
Education Fund of about $2,000,000, now in course of dissolution, 
and the John F. Slater Fund, now of about $1,500,000, may be 
mentioned. Wide differences of opinion exist regarding the char- 
acter of education needed for the race, and the present trend is 
towards a greater emphasis upon manual and industrial training as 
of prime importance for the great majority. 

Occupations. — The slavery system furnished industrial training to 
many slaves who seemed likely to turn it to their master's advantage. 
When this system was abolished the opportunities for such training 
open to the race were decreased, and it is doubtful whether even yet 
as large a proportion of skilled negro artizans are being trained in the 
south as were produced there before the Civil War. The demand for 
skilled labour in the south is being met more and more by white 
labour. This derives an advantage from a prejudice in its favour on 
the part of white employers even when other things are equal, from 
its greater skill and efficiency in most cases, its better opportunity 
to accumulate or to borrow the requisite capital, its superior in- 
dustry, persistence and thrift. In consequence negroes are being 
more and more excluded from the field of skilled labour in the 
south. 

Morals.— -As the death-rate is believed to vary inversely as health 
and longevity and thus to afford a measure of those characteristics, 
so the crime-rate is often thought to vary inversely as morality, and 
thus to measure the self-control, good order and moral health of the 
community. But the analogy cannot be pushed. The crime- rate 
is everywhere far more difficult, and in the United States impossible 
to ascertain. And even if known the connexion between the in- 
frequency of crime or of specific sorts of crime and the prevalence of * 
good order, obedience to law and morality is far more indirect and 
subject to far more qualifications than the connexion between the 
death-rate and health. Still the data regarding crime with all their 
defects are the best available index of moral progress or retrogression. 
It must be remembered that the comparative infrequency ofcrime 
among slaves, even if it existed, is no proof of the absence of criminal 
tendencies and actions. Offences on the part of slaves, or at least 
minor offences which are always far more numerous than serious 
offences, were dealt with in most cases privately and without in- 
voking the machinery of the law. An apparent increase of crime 
since emancipation might be due merely to the becoming patent of 
what was before latent. The only statistical measure of crime 
now possible in the United States is the number of prisoners in 
confinement at a given date, and these figures are an inadequate 
and misleading substitute for true judicial statistics. The evidence 
they afford, however, is far better than any other in existence and

1904 a slow increase in the number and a notable decrease in the 
proportion. 

But in order to make the figures for 1890 and 1904 comparable, it is 
necessary to exclude from those for the earlier date 4473 negro 
prisoners mainly belonging to^ two classes, persons in confinement 
prior to sentence and persons in prison because of their inability to 
pay a fine, but all belonging to classes which were excluded from the 
enumeration for 1904. This gives the following result: —

The proportion of negro prisoners to population increased rapidly 
between 1880 and 1890 and slightly between 1890 and 1904, the 
increase for the first period being most accurately shown by the 
first set of figures and that for the second period by the second set of 
figures. It is noteworthy also that the proportion of white prisoners 
to population decreased during the same period. Perhaps a more 
significant comparison is that between the proportion of prisoners 
ofeach race to the population of that race in the northern states and 
the southern states respectively, the distribution of population and 
the systems cf penal legislation and administration being widely 
different in the two sections. It is impossible to make the correction 
just referred to except for the United States as a whole, but it must 
be remembered that the figures for 1890 are not comparable with 
those for 1904, and that the true figures for that year would be 
decidedly less.

many; that in the northern states in 1890 there were about six 
times as many negro prisoners to population as white prisoners, and 
in 1904 about nine times as many. They throw no light whatever 
upon a point they are often quoted as establishing, the comparative 
criminality of the northern and southern negroes. Those residing in 
the north include an abnormal number of males, of adults, and of city 
population, influences all tending to increase the proportion of 
prisoners. It seems likely that if the figures for the south in 1890 
could be made strictly comparable with those for the same region in 
1904 the apparent decrease of 22% in the proportion of negro 
prisoners to population would almost but not quite disappear. The 
evidence regarding crime indicates a continued but slow and slacken- 
ing increase in the proportion of negro prisoners to negro population 
in the country as a whole and in its two main sections, an increase 
in the proportion of white prisoners to white population during the 
first interval and a decrease during the second, anda growing differ- 
ence between the two races in the proportion of prisoners. 

Citizenship. — When the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments 
to the Federal Constitution were adopted, the former conferring 
United States citizenship on all native negroes and the latter pro- 
viding that the right of such citizens to vote should not be abridged 
by any state on account of race, colour or previous condition of 
servitude, it was not the practice in northern states to allow negroes 
to vote. Proposals to grant them the suffrage were submitted to 
the voters in 1865 in Connecticut, Wisconsin, Minnesota and Colo- 
rado, and in each state they were rejected. In all states containing 
a large proportion of negroes the results of the Federal policy of 
reconstruction were disastrous, and those bitter years probably 
contributed more than the Civil War itself to estrange the two sec- 
tions. Since the withdrawal of Federal troops in 1877 the prevailing 
and persistent judgment of southern whites regarding the laws and 
the policy to be adopted upon this subject has been accorded more 
and more weight in determining the action of the states and thq 
Federal government. The number of negrces voting or entitled to 
vote has been reduced at first by intimidation or fraud, later by 



legislation or provisions of the state constitutions. If such enact- 
ments are nominally directed not against any race but against certain 
characteristics which may appear mainly in the race, such as illiteracy, 
inability or unwillingness to pay an annual poll tax or to register 
each year, they have been and are likely to be held within the 
constitutional authority of the state. On the part of 'the over- 
whelming majority of negroes this practical disfranchisement has 
aroused no protest, while it has tended to improve the government 
and to open the way for the gradual^ development and expression 
in word and vote of differences within the ranks of white voters 
regarding questions of public policy. 

Along with this decrease of pressure from without the southern 
states and the development of economic competition between the 
races within them, there has gone an increased demand on the part 
of the whites for a complete social separation between the races in 
school, in church, in public conveyances and hotels, all founded upon 
a fear that any disregard of such separateness will make intermarriage 
or fruitful illegal unions between the races more frequent. In short, 
these developments are towards a more and more rigid caste system. 

The negroes in the United States have played and are playing an 
important and necessary part in the industrial and economic life of 
the southern states, in which in 1908 they formed about one-third 
of the population. But that life was changing with marvellous 
rapidity, becoming less simple, less agricultural and patriarchal, 
more manufacturing and commercial, more strenuous and complex. 
It was too early to say whether the negroes would be given an equal 
or a fair opportunity to show that they could be as serviceable or 
more serviceable in such a civilization as they had been in that which 
was passing^ away, and whether the race would show itself able to 
accept and improve such chances as were afforded, and to remain in 
the future under these changing circumstances, as they had been in 
the past, a vital and essential part of the life of the nation. 

Bibliography. — Writings about the American negro fall naturally 
into classes. The official governmental publications include those of 
the Census Bureau, notably Bulletin 8, " Negroes in the United 
States," reprinted in 1906 in the volume called Supplementary 
Analysis, those of the Bureau of Labor, especially important articles 
in the Bulletin of the Bureau, and those of the commissioner of 
education. The information in these is largely statistical, but in the 
later publications not a little interpretative matter has been intro- 
duced. The point of view is usually that of a dispassionate northern 
man. 

Among southern white men who have written wisely on the subject 
may be mentioned: Dr J. L. M. Curry, for many years general agent 
of the Peabody and Slater funds; H. A. Herbert, Why the Solid 
South? or Reconstruction and its Results (Baltimore, 1890); T. N. 
Page, The Negro — the Southerner's Problem (New York, 1904); 
E. G. Murphy, Problems of the Present South (New York, 1904); 
E. R. Corson, Vital Equation of the Colored Race; and A. H. Stone, 
Studies in the American Race Problem (New York, 1908). F. L. 
Hoffman's Race, Traits and Tendencies of the American Negro (New 
York, 1896) contains the most important collection of statistical 
data in any private publication and interpretations thoroughly 
congenial to most southern whites. 

Among the southern negroes doubtless the most important 
writers are the two representatives of somewhat antagonistic views, 
Booker T. Washington, Up from Slavery (New York, 1901), Future 
of the American Negro (Boston, 1899), Tuskegee and its People (New 
York, 1905), &c, and W. E. B. Dubois, The Souls of Black Folk 
(Chicago, 1903), The Philadelphia Negro (Boston, 1899), Health and 
Physique of the Negro American (1907), &c. With these should be 
mentioned Atlanta University annual publications, the Proceedings 
of the Hampton Negro Conference and the file of the Southern 
Workman. No northern man since the war has written on the subject 
with the though tfulness and weight of Frederick Law Olmsted, 
Journey in the Seaboard Slave States (New York, 1856). See also

NEGUS. (1) The title of a king or ruler (Amharic negus or 
n'gus), in Abyssinia (q.v.); the full title of the emperor is negus 
nagasliy " king of kings." (2) The name of a drink made of 
wine, most commonly port, mixed with hot water, spiced and 
sugared. According to Malone {Life of Dryden, Prose Works, 
i. 484) this drink was invented by a Colonel Francis Negus 
(d. 1732), who was commissioner for executing the office of 
master of the horse from 1717 to 1727, when he became master 
of the buckhounds. 

NEHAVEND, a small but very fertile and productive province 
of Persia, situated south-west of Hamadan, west of Malayir, and 
north-west of Burujird. Pop. about 15,000. The capital is 
the ancient city of Nehavend, where Yazdegird, the last monarch 
of the Sassanian dynasty, was finally defeated by the Arabs. 
(a.d. 641). It has a population of about 5000, including 700 to 
800 Jews; there are fine gardens, and an old citadel on a hill. 
It is situated at an elevation of 5540 ft., 27 m. from Doletabad 
(Malayir), and 25 m. from Burujird.

NEHEMIAH— NEISSE 



NEHEMIAH (Heb. for " Yah[weh] comforts"), governor 
of Judaea under Artaxerxes (apparently A. Longimanus, 465- 
424 B.C.). The book of Nehemiah is really part of the same work 
with the book of Ezra, though it embodies certain memoirs of 
Nehemiah in which he writes in the first person. Apart from 
what is related in this book we possess little information about 
Nehemiah. The hymn of praise by Ben Sira (Ecclesiasticus 
xlix. 13) extols his fame for rebuilding the desolate city of 
Jerusalem and for raising up fresh homes for the, downtrodden 
people. According to other traditions he restored the temple- 
service and founded a collection of historical documents (2 Mace. 
i. 18-36, ii. 13). See further Ezra and Nehemiah (Books), 
Jews: History §§21 seq. 

NEIGHBOUR (0. Eng. niahgebur, from niah, " nigh," " near ") 
and gebftr, "boor," literally "dweller," "husbandman"; 
cf. Dan. and Swed. nabo, Ger. Nachbar), properly one who lives in 
a house close to one, hence any one of a number of persons living 
in the same locality. From Biblical associations (Luke x. 27) 
the word is used widely of one's fellow-men. 

NEILE, RICHARD (1 562-1 640), English divine, was educated 
at Westminster school and at St John's College, Cambridge. 
His first important preferment was as dean of Westminster 
(1605); afterwards he held successively the bishoprics of 
Rochester (1608), Lichfield (1610), Lincoln (1614), Durham 
(1617) and Winchester (1628), and the archbishopric of York 
(163 1). When at Rochester he appointed William Laud as his 
chaplain and gave him several valuable preferments. His 
political activity while bishop of Durham was rewarded with a 
privy councillorship in 1627. Neile sat regularly in the courts 
of star-chamber and high commission. His correspondence 
with Laud and with Sir Dudley Carle ton and Sir Francis Winde- 
bank (Charles I.'s secretaries of state) are valuable sources for 
the history of the time. 

NEILL, JAMES GEORGE SMITH (1810-1857), British 
soldier, was born near Ayr, Scotland, on the 26th of May 1810, 
and educated at Glasgow University. Entering the service of 
the East India Company in 1827,. he received his lieutenant's 
commission a year later. From 1828 to 1852 he* was mainly 
employed in duty with his regiment, the 1st Madras Europeans (of 
which he wrote a Historical Record), but gained some experience 
on the general and the personal staffs as D.A.A.G. and as aide-de- 
camp. In 1850 he received his majority, and two years later 
set out for the Burmese War with the regiment. He served 
throughout the war with distinction, became second-in-command 
to Cheape, and took part in the minor operations which followed, 
receiving the brevet of lieutenant-colonel. In June 1854 he was 
appointed second-in-command to Sir Robert Vivian to organize 
the Turkish contingent for the Crimean War. Early in 1857 he 
returned to India. Six weeks after his arrival came the news that 
all northern India was aflame with revolt. Neill acted promptly; 
he left Madras with his regiment at a moment's notice, and pro- 
ceeded to Benares. The day after his arrival he completely and 
ruthlessly crushed the mutineers (4th June 1857). He next 
turned his attention to Allahabad, where a handful of Europeans 
still held out in the fort against the rebels. From the 6th to 
the 15th of June his men forced their way under conditions of heat 
and of opposition that would have appalled any but a real 
leader of men, and the place, " the most precious in India at 
that moment," as Lord Canning wrote, was saved. Neill re- 
ceived his reward in an army colonelcy and appointment of 
aide-de-camp to the queen. Allahabad was soon made the con- 
centration of Havelock's column. The two officers, through 
a misunderstanding in their respective instructions, dis- 
agreed, and when Havelock went on from Cawnpore (which 
Neill had reoccupied shortly before) he left his subordinate 
there to command the lines of communication. At Cawnpore, 
while the traces of the massacre were yet fresh, Neill inflicted 
the death penalty on all his prisoners with the most merciless 
rigour. Meanwhile, Havelock, in spite of a succession of victories, 
had been compelled to fall back for lack of men; and Neill 
criticized his superior's action with a total want of restraint. 
A second expedition had the same fate, and Neill himself was now 



attacked, though by his own exertions and Havelock's victory 
at Bithor (16th August) the tension on the communications 
was ended. Havelock's men returned to Cawnpore, and cholera 
broke out there, whereupon Neill again committed himself to 
criticisms, this time addressed to the commander-in-chief and 
to Out ram, who was on the way with reinforcements. In spite of 
these very grave acts of insubordination, Havelock gave his 
rival a brigade command in the final advance. The famous 
march from Cawnpore to Lucknow began on September 19th; on 
the 2 1 st there was a sharp fight, on the 22nd incessant rain, on 
the 23rd intense heat. On the 23rd the fighting opened with the 
assault on the Alum Bagh, Neill at the head of the leading 
brigade recklessly exposing himself. Next day he was again 
heavily engaged, and on the 25th he led the great attack on 
Lucknow itself. The fury of his assault carried everything 
before it, and his men were entering the city when a bullet killed 
their commander. Strict as he was, he was loved not less than 
feared, and throughout the British dominions he had established 
a name as a skilful and extraordinarily energetic commander. 
The rank and precedence of the wife of a K.C.B. was given to 
his widow, and memorials have been erected in India and at Ayr.

man, Life of Havelock (1867). 

NEILSON, ADELAIDE (1846-1880), English actress, whose 
real name was Elizabeth Ann Brown, was born in Leeds, the 
daughter of an actress, and her childhood and early youth were 
passed in poverty and menial work. In 1865 she appeared in 
Margate as Julia in The Hunchback, a character with which her 
name was long to be associated. For the next few years she 
played at several London and provincial theatres in various 
parts, including Rosalind, Amy Robsart and Rebecca (in Ivanhoe), 
Beatrice, Viola and Isabella (in Measure for Measure), In 1872 
she visited America, where her beauty and talent made her a 
great favourite, and she returned year after year. She died on 
the 15th of August 1880. Miss Neilson was married to Philip 
Henry Lee, but was divorced in 1877.- 

NEISSE, three rivers of Germany. (1) The Glatzer Neisse 
rises on the Schneegebirge, at an altitude of 1400 ft., flows 
north past Glatz, turns east and pierces the Eulengebirge in 
the Wartha pass, then continues east as far as the town of Neisse, 
and after that flows north-east until at an altitude of 453 ft. 
it joins the Oder between Oppeln and Brieg. Owing to its 
torrential character the greater part of its course is only used 
for floating down timber. It abounds in fish, and its total length 
is 121 m. (2) The Lausitzer or Gorlitz'er Neisse rises near 
Reichenberg in Bohemia, on the south side of the Riesengebirge, 
at an altitude of 1130 ft., flows north past Reichenberg, Gorlitz, 
Forst and Guben, and enters the Oder above Fiirstenberg 
at an altitude of 105 ft. Its length is 140 m., of which less than 
40 m. are navigable. (3) The Wutende Neisse is a tributary of 
the Katzbach. 

NEISSE, a town and fortress of Germany, in the province of 
Prussian Silesia, at the junction of the Neisse and the Biela, 
32 m. by rail S.W. of Oppeln. Pop. (1905) 25,394 (mostly 
Roman Catholics) including a garrison of about 5000. It consists 
of the town proper, on the right bank of the Neisse, and the 
Friedrichstadt on the left. The Roman Catholic parish church 
of St James (Jakobikircbe) dates mainly from the 13th century, 
but was finished in 1430. The chief secular buildings are the 
old episcopal residence, the new town hall, the old Rathaus, 
with a tower 205 ft. in height (1499), the beautiful Renaissance 
Kammerei (exchequer) with a high gabled roof ornamented with 
frescoes, and the theatre. A considerable trade is carried on 
in agricultural products. 

Neisse, one of the oldest towns in Silesia, is said to have been 
founded in the 10th century, and afterwards became the capital 
cf a principality of its own name, which was incorporated with 
the bishopric of Breslau about 1200. Its first walls were erected 
in 1350, and enabled it to repel an attack of the Hussites in 1424. 
It was thrice besieged during the Thirty Years' War. The end 
of the first Silesian War left Neisse in the hands of Frederick 
the Great, who laid the foundations of its modern fortifications.

The town was taken by the French in 1807. Neisse can, at the 
will of the garrison, be protected by a system of inundation.

NEJD, a central province of Arabia, bounded N. by the Nafud 
desert, E. by El Hasa, S. by the Dahna desert and \V. by Asir 
and Hejaz. It lies between 20 and 28 N. and 41 ° and 48 E., 
extends nearly 550 m. from north to south, 450 from east 
to west, and covers approximately 180,000 sq. m. The name 
Nejd implies an upland, and this is the distinctive character 
of the province as compared with the adjoining coastal districts 
of Hejaz and El Hasa. Its general elevation varies from 5000 ft. 
on its western border to 2500 in Kasim in the north-east, 
and somewhat less in Yemama in the south-east. In the north 
the double range of Jebel Shammar, and in the east the ranges 
of J. Tuwek and J. 'Arid rise about 1500 ft. above the general 
level, but on the whole it may be described as an open steppe, 
sloping very gradually from S.W. to N.E. of which the western 
and southern portion is desert, or at best pasture land only 
capable of supporting a nomad population; while in the north 
and east, owing to greater abundance of water, numerous fertile 
oases are found with a large settled population. The principal 
physical features are described in the article Arabia. 

The main divisions of Nejd are the following: Jebel Shammar, 
Kasim, Suder, Wushm, *Arid, Aflaj, Harik, Yemama and Wadi 
Dawasir. J. Shammar is the most northerly: its principal 
settlements are situated in the valley some 70 m. long, between 
the two ranges of J. Aja and J. Selma, though a few lie on their 
outer flanks. Jauf, Tema and Khaibar, though dependencies 
of the Shammar principality, lie beyond the limits of Nejd. 
The capital, Hail, has been visited by several Europeans, by 
W. G. Palgrave in 1862, when Talal was emir, and by Mr Wilfrid 
and Lady Anne Blunt, Charles Doughty, C. Huber, T. Euting 
and Baron E. Nolde during the reign of Mahommed b. Rashid, 
who from 1892 till his death in 1897 was emir of all Nejd. Its 
well ordered and thriving appearance is commented on by all 
these travellers. The town is surrounded by a wall and dominated 
by the emir's palace, a stately, if somewhat gloomy building, 
the walls of which are quite 75 ft. high, with six towers, the whole 
giving the idea of an old French or Spanish donjon. 

Hail lies at the northern end of the valley, 2 m. S.E. of J. 
Aja, at an altitude of about 3000 ft. The highest point of J. 
Aja, the western and higher of the twin ranges, is according to 
Huber 4600 ft. above sea-level. The valley is about 20 m. in 
width and is intersected with dry ravines and dotted with low 
ridges generally of volcanic origin. Wells and springs are the 
only source of water supply, both for drinking and for irrigation. 
The principal crops are dates, wheat and barley and garden 
produce; forage and firewood are very scarce. The population 
was estimated by Nolde in 1893 at 10,000 to 12,000. 

Among the other settlements of J. Shammar are Jafefa 
and Mukak at the northern foot of J. Aja, Kasr and Kafar 
at its southern foot, Rauda, Mustajidda and Fed at the foot 
of J. Selma, all large villages of 3000 to 5000 inhabitants. 
'Akda is a small valley in the heart of J. Aja, an hour's ride 
from Hail; it was the oldest possession of the Ibn Rashid, 
since 1835 the ruling family of J. Shammar, and is a place of 
great natural strength. Kasim lies E. of J. Shammar in the 
valley of the W. Rumma the great wadi of northern Nejd; 
the chief towns Bureda and *Aneza are situated about 10 m. 
apart, on the north and south sides of the wadi respectively. 
Doughty described *Aneza in 1879 as clean and well built with 
walls ^ of sun-dried brick, with well supplied shops. Many 
inhabitants live in distant houses in gardens outside the town 
walls, ' Aneza and Bureda each contain some 1 o,ooo inhabitants. 
The dry bed of the Wadi Rumma in lower Kasim is about 2 m. 
across, fringed in places with palm plantations; water is found 
at 6 or 8 ft. in the dry season and in winter the wells overflow. 
The staple of cultivation is the date-palm, the fruit ripening in 
August or September. Fruit trees and fields of wheat, maize 
or millet surround the villages, but 'the extent of cultivation 



is limited by the necessity of artificial irrigation. Kahafa, 
Kuseba and Kuwara are the principal villages of upper Kasim; 
and *Aneza and Bureda, Madnab, Ayun and Ras of lower 
Kasim. 

Doughty's and Huber's explorations did not extend east of 
Kasim, and for all details regarding eastern and southern Nejd 
Palgrave is the only authority. According to him, a long 
desert march leads from Madnab to Zulfa the first settlement 
in Suder, where the land rises steadily to the high calcareous 
tableland of J. Tuwek. The entire plateau is intersected by a 
maze of valleys, generally with steep banks, as if artificially cut 
out of the limestone. In these countless hollows is concentrated 
the fertility and population of Nejd; gardens and houses, 
cultivation and villages lie hidden from view among the depths 
while one journeys over the dry flats, till one comes suddenly 
on a mass of emerald green beneath. 

Suder forms the northern end of the plateau, \Arid the southern, 
while Wushm appears to lie on its west, and Aflaj and el Harik 
below it and to the south and south-west respectively. The 
principal town is Majma the former capital of Suder, a walled 
town situated on an eminence in a broad shallow valley sur- 
rounded by luxuriant gardens and trees. Tuwem, Jalajil and 
Hula are also described by Palgrave as considerable towns. 

*Arid is entered at Sedus, on the W. Hanifa, a broad valley 
bottom with precipitous sides, here 2 or 3 m. wide, full of trees 
and brushwood. Along its course lie the villages of Ayana, and 
Deraiya the former Wahhabi capital, destroyed by Ibrahim 
Pas^ha in 1817; and a few miles farther E. the new capital 
Riad, built by the emir Fesal after his restoration and visited 
by Palgrave in 1863, and by Pelly two years later. It was then, 
and still is, a large town of perhaps 20,000 inhabitants with 
thirty or more mosques, well-stocked bazars, and like the towns 
of Kasim, surrounded by well-watered gardens and palm groves. 
To the south the valley opens out into the great plains of Yemama, 
dotted with groves and villages, among which Manfuha is 
scarcely inferior in size to Riad itself. Still farther to the south- 
east lies the district of Harik, with its capital Hauta, the last 
in that direction of the settled districts of Nejd, and on the 
borders of the southern desert. 

Palgrave visited El Kharfa the chief place of the Aflaj district 
some 80 m. S.W. of Riad. This district seems to be scantily 
peopled as compared with Suder or Yemama, and a large propor- 
tion of the inhabitants are of mixed negro origin. While there, 
he made inquiries about the adjoining district of W. Dawasir. 
Its length was stated to be ten days' journey or 200 m.; scattered 
villages consisting of palm-leaf huts lie along the way, which 
leads in a south or south-westerly direction to the highlands of 
Asir and Yemen. 

The Bedouin who occupy the remainder of Nejd consist in 
the main of the four great tribes of the Shammar, Harb, 'Ateba 
and Muter. The first-named represent that part of the great 
Shammar tribe which has remained in its ancestral home on 
the southern edge of the Nafud (the northern branch long ago 
emigrated to Mesopotamia); many of its members have settled 
down to town life, but the tribe still retains its Bedouin character, 
and its late chief, the emir Mahommed Ibn Rashid, the most 
powerful prince in Nejd, used to live a great part of the year in the 
desert with his tribesmen. The Harb are probably the largest of 
the Bedouin tribes in the peninsula; they are divided into a 
number of sections, several of which have settled in the oases 
of Hejaz, while others remain nomadic. Their territory is the 
steppe between Kasim and Medina, and across the pilgrim road 
between Medina and Mecca, for the protection of which they 
receive considerable subsidies from the Turks. The 'Ateba 
circuits extend from the Hejaz border near Mecca along the road 
leading thence to Kasim. The Muter occupy the desert from 
Kasim northwards towards Kuwet. 

Nejd became nominally a dependency of the Turkish empire 
in 1 87 1 when Midhat Pasha established a small garrison in El 
Hasa, and created a new civil district under the government 
of Basra, under the title of Nejd, with headquarters at Hofuf. 
Its real independence was not, however, affected, and the emirs,

NEJEF— NELSON 



Mahommed Ibn Rashid at Hail, and Abdallah Ibn Sa'ud at 
Riad, ruled in western and eastern Nejd respectively, until 1892, 
when the former by his victory at 'Aneza became emir of all 
Nejd. His successor, Abdul Aziz Ibn Rashid, was, however, 
unable to maintain his position, and in spite of Turkish support, 
sustained a severe defeat in 1905 at the hands of Ibn Sa'ud 
which for the time, at any rate, restored the supremacy to Riad. 

No data exist for an accurate estimate of the population; 
it probably exceeds 1,000,000, of which two-thirds may be 
settled, and one-third nomad or Bedouin. Palgrave in 1863, 
perhaps unduly exaggerating the importance of the town 
population, placed it at nearly double this figure. 

The revenue of the emir Mahommed Ibn Rashid of Hail, who 
died in 1897, was estimated by Blunt in 1879 at £80,000, and his 
expenditure at little more than half that amount. Nolde who 
visited Hail in 1893 after the emir's conquest of the Wahhabi 
state, believed that his surplus income then amounted to £60,000 
a year, and his accumulated treasure to £1,500,000.

NEJEF, or Meshed 'Ali, a town of Asiatic Turkey, in the 
pashalik of Bagdad, 50 m. S. of Kerbela and 5 or 6 m. W. of 
the ruins of ancient Ku*fa, out of the bricks of which it is chiefly 
built. It stands on the eastern edge of the Syrian desert, on 
the north-eastern shore of a deep depression, formerly a sea, 
the Assy Hum Stagnum of the old geographers, but in latter years 
drained and turned into gardens for the town. It is a fairly 
prosperous city, supplied with admirable water by an under- 
ground aqueduct from the Hindieh canal, a few miles to the 
north, which also serves to water the gardens in the deep dry 
bed of the former lake. The town is enclosed by nearly square 
brick walls, flanked by massive round towers, dating from the 
time of the caliphs, but now falling into decay. Outside the 
walls, over the sterile sand plateau, stretch great fields of tombs 
and graves, for Nejef is so holy that he who is buried here will 
surely enter paradise. In the centre of the town stands Meshed 
(strictly Meshhed) *Ali, the shrine of 'Ali, containing the reputed 
tomb of that caliph, which is regarded by the Shi'ite Moslems 
as being no less holy than the Ka'ba itself, although it should 
be said that it is at least very doubtful whether 'Ali was actually 
buried there. The dome of the shrine is plated with gold, and 
within the walls and roof are covered with polished silver, 
glass and coloured tiles. The resting-place of *Ali is represented 
by a silver tomb with windows grated with silver bars and a 
door with a great silver lock. Inside this is a smaller tomb of 
damascened ironwork. In the court before the dome rise two 
minarets, plated, like the dome, with finely beaten gold from 
the height of a man and upward. While the population of 
Nejef is estimated at from 20,000 to 30,000, there is in addition 
a very large floating population of pilgrims, who are constantly 
arriving, bringing corpses in all stages of decomposition and 
accompanied at times by sick and aged persons, who have come 
to Nejef to die. At special seasons the number of pilgrims exceeds 
many times the population of the town. Nejef is also the point 
of departure from which Persian pilgrims start on the journey 
to Mecca. No Jews or Christians are allowed to reside 
there. The accumulated treasures of Meshed 'AH were 
carried off by the Wahhabi tes early in the 19th century, and in 
1843 the town was deprived cf many of its former liberties and 
compelled to submit to Turkish law; but it is again enormously 
wealthy, for what is given to the shrine may never be sold or used 
for any outside purpose, but constantly accumulates. Moreover, 
the hierarchy derives a vast revenue from the fees for burials 
in the sacred limits.

NELEUS, in Greek legend, son of Poseidon and Tyro, brother of 
Pelias. The two children were exposed by their mother, who 
afterwards married Cretheus, king of Iolcus in Thessaly, After 



the death of Cretheus, the boys, who had been brought up 
by herdsmen, quarrelled for the possession of Iolcus. Pelias 
expelled Neleus, who migrated to Messenia, where he became 
king of Pylos (Apollodorus i. 9; Diod. Sic. iv. 68) and the 
ancestor of a royal family called the Neleidae, who are historically 
traceable as the old ruling family in some of the Ionic states 
in Asia Minor. Their presence is explained by the legend that, 
when the Dorians conquered Pel6ponnesus, the Neleidae were 
driven out and took refuge in Attica, whence they led colonies 
to the eastern shores of the Aegean. By Chloris, daughter of 
Amphion, Neleus was the father of twelve sons (of whom Nestor 
was the most famous) and a daughter Pero. Through the contest 
for his daughter's hand (see Melampus) he is connected with the 
legends of the prophetic race of the Melampodidae, who founded 
the mysteries and expiatory rites and the orgies of Dionysus in 
Argolis. According to Pausanias (ii. 2. 2, v. 8. 2) Neleus restored 
the Olympian games and died at Corinth, where he was buried 
on the isthmus. 

NELLORE, a town and district of India, in the Madras pre- ' 
sidency. The town is on the right bank of the Pennar river, and 
has a station on the East Coast railway, 109 m. N. of Madras 
city. Pop. (1901) 32,040. There are United Free Church, 
American Baptist and Catholic missions. 

The District op Nellore has an area of 8761 sq. m. It 
comprises a tract of low-lying land extending from the base of 
the Eastern Ghats to the sea. Its general aspect is forbidding: 
the coast-line is a fringe of blown sand through which the waves 
occasionally break, spreading a salt sterility over the fields. 
Farther inland the country begins to rise, but the soil is not 
naturally fertile, nor are means of ^irrigation readily at hand. 
About one-half of the total area is cultivated; the rest is either 
rocky waste or is covered with low scrub jungle. The chief 
rivers are the Pennar, Suvarnamukhi and Gundlakamma. 
They are not navigable, but are utilized for irrigation purposes, 
the chief irrigation work being the anicut across the Pennar. 
Nellore, however, is subject both to droughts and to floods. 
Copper was discovered in the western hills in 1801, but several 
attempts by European capitalists to work the ore proved unre- 
munerative, and the enterprise has been abandoned since 1840. 
Iron ore is smelted by indigenous methods in many places, 
but the most important mining industry is that of mica. Salt 
is largely manufactured along the sea-coast. Nellore, with the 
other districts of the Carnatic, passed under direct British 
administration in 1801. The population in 1901 was 1,496,987 
showing an increase of 2-3% in the decade. In 1904 a portion 
of the district was transferred to the newly formed district of 
Guntur, reducing the remaining area to 7965 sq. m., with a 
population of 1,272,81s. The principal crops are millets, rice, 
other food grains, indigo and oil-seeds. The breed of cattle is 
celebrated. The East Coast railway, running through the 
length of the district, was opened throughout for traffic in 1899. 
The section from Nellore town to Gudur, formerly on the metre 
gauge, has been converted to the standard gauge. Previously 
the chief means of communication with Madras was by the 
Buckingham canal. The sea-borne trade is insignificant. 

NELSON, HORATIO NELSON, Viscount (1758-1805), duke 
of Bronte in Sicily, British naval hero, was born at the parsonage 
house of Burnham Thorpe, in Norfolk, on the 29th of September 
1758. His father, Edmund Nelson (1722-1802), who came of a 
clerical family, was rector of the parish. His mother, whose 
maiden name was Catherine Suckling (1725-1767), wasa grand- 
niece of Sir Robert Walpole (1st earl of Orford). This connexion 
proved of little or no value to the future admiral, who, in a 
letter to his brother, the Rev. William Nelson, written in 1784, 
speaks of the Walpoles as " the merest set of cyphers that ever 
existed — in public affairs I mean." His introduction to the 
navy came from his maternal uncle, Captain Maurice Suckling 
(1 725-1778), an officer of some reputation who at his death held 
the important post of comptroller of the navy. Horatio, who 
had received a summary, and broken, education at Norwich, 
Downham and North Walsham, was entered on the " Raisonable " 
when Captain Suckling was appointed to her in 1770 on an alarm 



NELSON

of war with Spain. The dispute was settled, and Captain Suckling 
was transferred to the " Triumph," the guardship at Chatham, 
whither he took his nephew. In order that the lad might have 
more practice than could be obtained on a harbour ship, his 
uncle sent him to the West Indies in a merchant vessel, and on 
his return gave him constant employment in boat work on the 
river. In a brief sketch of his life, which he drew up in 1799, 
Nelson says that in this way he became a good pilot for small 
vessels " from Chatham to the Tower of London, down the Swin, 
and the North Foreland; and confident of myself among rocks 
and sands, which has many times since been of great comfort 
to me." Between April and October of 1772 he served with 
Captain Lutwidge in the " Carcass," one of the vessels which 
went on a not otherwise notable voyage to the Arctic seas 
with Captain Phipps, better known by his Irish title of Baron 
Mulgrave. On his return from the north he was sent to the 
East Indies in the " Seahorse," in which vessel he made the 
acquaintance of his lifelong friend Thomas. Troubridge. At 
the end of two years he was invalided home. In after times 
he spoke of the depression under which he laboured during the 
return voyage, till " after a long and gloomy reverie, in which 
I almost wished myself overboard, a sudden glow of patrotism 
was kindled within me, and presented my king and my country 
as my patron. My mind exulted in the idea. 'Well then,' 
I exclaimed, 'I will be a hero, and, confiding in Providence, I 
will brave every danger.' " He spoke to friends of the " radiant 
orb " which from that hour hung ever before him, and "urged 
him onward to renown." On his return home he served during 
a short cruise in the " Worcester " frigate, passed his examination 
as lieutenant on the 9th April 1777, and was confirmed in the 
rank next day. He went to the West Indies with Captain Locker 
in the " Lowestoft " frigate, was transferred to the flagship by 
the admiral commanding on the station, Sir Peter Parker (1721- 
1811), and was then by him promoted in rapid succession to the 
command of the " Badger " brig, and the " Hinchinbrook " 
frigate. By this appointment, which he received in 1779, he 
was placed in the rank of post captain (from which promotion 
to flag rank was by seniority), at the very early age of twenty. 
His connexion with Captain Suckling may, no doubt, have been 
of use to him, but in the main he owed his rapid rise to his power 
of winning the affection of all those he met, whether as comrades 
or superiors. Sir Peter Parker and Lady Parker remained 
his friends all through his life. In 1780 he saw his first active 
service in an expedition to San Juan de Nicaragua, which was 
rendered deadly by the climate. He was brought to death's 
door by fever, and invalided home once more. In 1781 he was 
appointed to the "Albemarle" frigate, and after some convoy 
service in the North Sea and the Sound was sent to Newfoundland 
and thence to the North American station. " Fair Canada," 
as he has recorded in one of his letters, gave him the good health 
he had so far never enjoyed. At Quebec he formed one of those 
passionate attachments to women which marked his career. 
He now made the personal acquaintance of Sir Samuel Hood, 
Lord Hood. In the autobiographical sketch already quoted he 
mentions the high opinion formed of him by the admiral who 
presented him to Prince William, duke of Clarence, afterwards 
King William IV., as an officer well qualified to instruct him 
in " naval tactics," by which we must perhaps understand 
seamanship. Prince William has left a brief but singularly vivid 
account of their first meeting. He appeared, says the Prince, 
"to be the merest boy of a captain I ever beheld; and his dress 
was worthy of attention. He had on a full-laced uniform; his 
lank unpowdered hair was tied in a stiff Hessian tail of an extra- 
ordinary length; the old-fashioned flaps of his waistcoat added 
to the general quaintness of his figure, and produced an appear- 
ance which particularly attracted my notice; for I had never 
seen anything like it before, nor could I imagine who he was or 
what he came about. My doubts were, however, removed when 
Lord Hood introduced me to him. There was something 
irresistibly pleasing in his address and conversation; and an 
enthusiasm, when speaking on professional subjects, that showed 
he was no common being." The slight oddity of appearance, 
XIX- 12 



the power to arouse affection, and the glow indicating the 
fire within, are noted by all who ever looked Nelson in the 
face. 

In- March 1783, at the very end of the American War, he saw 
his second piece of active service. He was repulsed in an attempt 
to retake Turk's Island from the French. The peace gave him 
leisure to pay a visit to France, for which country and all its 
ways he entertained a dislike and contempt characteristic of 
his time. In France he formed another attachment, and went 
so far as to apply to a maternal uncle for an allowance to eke 
out his half-pay. It came to nothing, presumably by refusal 
on the lady's part. And now when the navy was cut down to 
the quick on the peace establishment, and the vast majority of 
naval officers were condemned to idleness on shore, he had the 
extraordinary good fortune to be appointed to the command 
of the "Boreas" frigate, for service in the West Indies. Nelson 
found in this commission an opportunity for the display of his 
readiness to assume responsibility. He signalized his arrival 
in the West Indies by refusing to obey an order of the admiral 
which required him to acknowledge a half-pay officer acting as 
commissioner of the dockyard at Antigua as his superior. He 
insisted on enforcing the Navigation Laws against the Americans, 
who by becoming independent had become foreigners. He called 
the attention of the government to the corruption prevailing in 
the dockyard of Antigua. His line was in all cases correct, but 
it impressed the admiralty as somewhat assuming, and his strong 
measures against the interloping trade brought on him many 
lawsuits, which, though he was defended at the expense of the 
government, caused him much trouble for years. In the West 
Indies on the 12th of March 1787 he married Frances Nisbet 
(i76i-i83i),the widowof a doctor in Nevis, whose favour he first 
gained by being found romping on all fours with her little boy 
under the drawing-room table. The marriage was one of affection 
and prudence, rather than of love. 

Though Nelson had as yet seen little active service, and that 
little had not been specially distinguished, be had already gained 
that reputation within his own service which commonly precedes 
pubb'c recognition. His character had been fully developed, 
and his capacity proved. His horizon was narrow, being strictly 
confined to his profession. He had all the convictions of the 
typical John Bull of his generation. The loyalty of a devoted 
subject was strong in him. He burned to win affection, admira- 
tion, distinction. He was a man to do whatever there was to be 
done to the utmost. A # more magnificent instrument for use in 
the great Revolutionary struggle now close at hand could not 
have been forged. 

War having broken out, he was appointed captain cf the 
"Agamemnon" (64) on the 30th of November 1793, and joined 
his ship on the 7th of February. From this date till June 1800, 
rather more than seven years, he was engaged on continual 
active service, with the exception of a few months when he was 
invalided home. This period is the most varied, the busiest, 
the most glorious and the most debated of a very full career. 
It subdivides naturally into three sections; (1) From the date o\ 
his appointment as captain of the "Agamemnon" till he was 
disabled by the loss of his arm in the unsuccessful attack on 
Santa Cruz de Tenerife on the 24th of July 1797 he served as 
captain, or commodore, under Hood, Hotham and Jervis, 
successive commanders-in-chief in the Mediterranean. (2) After 
an interval of nine months spent at home in recovering from his 
wound, and from the effects of a badly performed operation, 
he returned to the Mediterranean, and was at once sent in pursuit 
of the great French armament which sailed from Toulon under 
the command of Napoleon for the conquest of Egypt. II is victory 
of the Nile on the 1st of August 1798 placed him at once in the 
foremost rank among the warriors of a warlike time, and made 
him a national hero. With his return to Naples on the 22nd of 
September the second period ends. (3) From now till he landed 
at Leghorn on the 26th of July 1800, on his return home across 
Europe, he was entangled at Naples in political transactions 
and intrigues, which he was ill prepared to deal with either by 
nature or training, and was plunged into the absorbing passion, 



354 



NELSON 



which did increase his popularity with the mob, but cost him 
many friends. 

The first of these three passages in his life is full of events 
which must, however, be told briefly. In May he sailed for the 
Mediterranean with Hood, and was engaged under his orders 
in the occupation of Toulon by the allied British and Spanish 
forces. In August 1793 he was despatched to Naples to convoy 
the troops which the Neapolitan government had undertaken 
to contribute towards the garrison of Toulon. It was on this 
occasion that he made the acquaintance of Emma Hamilton 
(q.v.), the wife of Sir William Hamilton, minister at the Court of 
Naples. References to Lady Hamilton begin to appear in his 
letters to his wife, but, as might be expected, they indicate 
little beyond respectful admiration, and he makes a good deal 
of her kindness to his stepson, Josiah Nisbet, whom he had taken 
to sea. Young Nisbet was afterwards promoted to post captain, 
and was put in command of a frigate at an improperly early 
age by Nelson's interest. He proved quite unworthy, and in the 
end died mad. After the allies had been driven from Toulon 
by Napoleon, ^Nelson was employed throughout 1794 in the 
operations connected with the occupation of Corsica. In April 
and May he was engaged in the capture of Bastia, and June and 
July in the taking of Calvi. Both towns really surrendered from 
want of stores, but the naval brigades under Nelson's personal 
direction were conspicuously active, and their energy was 
favourably contrasted with the alleged formality of the troops. 
During the operations at Calvi, Nelson's right eye was 
destroyed by gravel driven into it by a cannon shot which 
struck the ground close to him. From the date of the occupation 
of Corsica till the island was evacuated, that is to say, from the 
end of 1794 till the middle of 1796, he was incessantly active. 
He served under Hotham, who undertook the command when 
Hood returned to England, and was engaged in the indecisive 
actions fought by him in tbe Gulf of Lyons in March and July 
1795. The easy-going ways of the new admiral fretted the eager 
spirit of Nelson, and Hotham's placid satisfaction with the 
trifling result of his encounters with the French provoked his 
subordinate into declaring that, for his part, he would never 
think that the British fleet had done very well if a single ship 
of the enemy got off while there was a possibility of taking her. 
His zeal found more satisfaction when he was detached to the 
Riviera of Genoa, where, first as captain, and then as commodore, 
he had an opportunity to prove his qualities for independent 
command by harassing the communications of the French, 
and co-operating with the Austrians. In Sir John Jervis, who 
superseded Hotham, he found a leader after his own heart. 
When Spain, after first making peace with France at Basel, 
declared war on England, and the fleet under Jervis withdrew 
from the Mediterranean, Nelson was despatched to Elba on a 
hazardous mission to bring off the small garrison and the naval 
stores. He sailed in the "Minerve" frigate, having another 
with him. After a smart action with two Spanish frigates which 
he took off Carthagena on the 20th of December, and a narrow 
escape from a squadron of Spanish line of battle ships, he ful- 
filled his mission, and rejoined the flag of Jervis on the eve of the 
great battle off Cape St Vincent on the 14th of February 1797 
(see St Vincent, Battle of). The judgment, independence 
■and promptitude he showed in this famous engagement, were 
rewarded by the conspicuous part he had in the victory, and 
revealed him to the nation as one of the heroes of the navy. 
Nelson receiving the swords of the Spanish officers on the deck 
of the " San Josef " became at once a popular figure. 

A few days after the victory he became rear-admiral by 
seniority, but continued with Jervis, who was made a peer under 
the title of Earl St Vincent. Nelson's own services were recog- 
nized by the grant of the knighthood of the Bath. During the 
trying months in which the fleet was menaced by the sedition 
then rife in the navy, which came to a head in the mutinies at 
Spitbead and the Nore, he remained with the flag, and in the 
blockade of Cadiz. In July 1797 he was sent on a desperate 
mission to Santa Cruz de Tenerifc. It was believed that a 
Spanish Manilla ship carrying treasure had anchored at that 



place, and Lord St Vincent was desirous of depriving the enemy 
of this resource. The enterprise was, in fact, rash in the last 
degree, for the soldiers from the garrisons of Elba and Corsica 
having gone home, no troops were available for the service, and 
a fortified town was to be taken by man-cf-war boats alone. 
Nelson's well-established character for daring marked him out 
for a duty which could only succeed by dash and surprise, if it 
was to succeed at all. But the Spaniards were on the alert, 
and the attack, made with the utmost daring on the night of the 
24th of July, was repulsed with heavy loss. Some of the boats 
missed the mole in the dark and were stove in by the surf, others 
which found the mole were shattered by the fire of the Spaniards. 
Nelson's right elbow was shot through, and he fell back into the 
boat from which he was directing the attack. The amputation 
of his arm was badly performed in the hurry and the dark. 
He was invalided home, and spent months of extreme pain in 
London and at Bath. On the 10th of April 1798 he came back 
to the fleet off Cadiz as rear-admiral, with his flag in the " Van- 
guard " (74). 

He was now one of the most distinguished officers in the navy. 
Within the next six months he was to raise himself far above 
the heads of all his contemporaries. It was notorious that a great 
armament was preparing at Toulon for some unknown destina- 
tion. To discover its purpose, and to defeat it, the British 
government resolved to send their naval forces again into the 
Mediterranean, and Nelson was chosen for the command by 
Jervis, with whom the immediate decision lay, but also by 
ministers. 

Having joined the flag of Lord St Vincent outside of the 
straits of Gibraltar on the 30th of April, Nelson was detached 
on the 2nd of May into the Mediterranean, with three line-of- 
battle ships and five frigates, to discover the aim of the Toulon 
armament. Napoleon had, however, enforced rigid secrecy, and 
the British adrriiralhad to confess that the French were better 
than the British at concealing their plans. Beyond the fact that 
a powerful combined force was collected in the French port he 
could learn nothing. On the 20th of May the " Vanguard " was 
dismasted in a gale. Nelson bore the check in a highly character- 
istic manner. "I ought not," he wrote, "to call what has 
happened by the cold name of accident; but I believe firmly 
that it was the Almighty's goodness to check my consummate 
vanity." The " Vanguard " was saved from going on shore by 
the seaman-like skill of Captain Ball of the "Alexander," against 
whom Nelson had hitherto had a prejudice, but for whom 
he had henceforth a peculiar regard. The " Vanguard " w r as 
refitted by the exertions of her own crew under cover of the little 
island of San Pietri on the southern coast of Sardinia. In the 
meantime the frigates attached to his command had returned 
to Gibraltar, in the erroneous belief that the liners would be 
taken there to make good the damage suffered in the gale. " I 
thought Hope would have known me better," said Nelson. 
On the 30th of April he was off Toulon again, only to find that 
the French were gone, and that he could not learn whither they 
were steering. Racked by anxiety and deprived of his best 
means of obtaining information by the disappearance of his 
frigates, he remained cruising till he was joined, on the 7th of 
June, by Troubridge with ten sail of the line. And now he started 
on his fierce pursuit of the enemy, seeking him in the dark, for 
there were no scouts at hand; exasperated at being left without 
the eyes of his fleet; half maddened at the thought he might, 
by no fault of his own, miss the renown towards which his pro- 
phetic imagination had seemed to guide him; knowing that St 
Vincent would be blamed for choosing so young an admiral; 
but resolved to follow the enemy to the antipodes if necessary. 
From the coast of Sardinia to Naples, from Naples to Messina, 
from Messina to Alexandria, from Alexandria, where he found 
the roadstead empty, back to Sicily, and then when at last a 
ray of light came to him, back to Alexandria — he swept the central 
and eastern Mediterranean. At no time in his life were 
the noble qualities of his nature displayed more entirely free 
from all alloy. He was an embodied flame of resolution, and as 
yet he showed no sign of the vulgar bluster which was to appear 



NELSON 



355 



later. In the midst of his anxieties his kindness of heart shone 
forth without a trace of the tendency of sentimental gush so 
irritatingly obvious in after days. Unlike most admirals of his 
time, he did not live apart from his captains, but saw much of 
them, and freely discussed his plans with them. He had his 
reward in their devotion and perfect comprehension of what 
he wished them to do. At the same time he acquired an absolute 
confidence in the efficiency of his squadron, the magnificent 
force which had been formed by years of successful war, and by 
the careful training of his predecessors. The captains were the 
band of brothers he himself had made them. 

The great victory of the ist of August 1798 (see Nile, Battle 
of) brought Nelson yet another wound. He was struck on the 
forehead by a langridge shot, and had for a time to go below. 
It is perhaps to be lamented in the interest of his fame that the 
wound was not severe enough to compel him to return home. 
After providing for the blockade of what remained of the French 
fleet in Alexandria, he sailed for Naples, and arrived there on the 
22nd of September. There was no rear-admiral of any standing 
in the navy who could not have done what remained to be done 
in the Mediterranean, under the supervision of St Vincent,' as 
well as he. For him Naples was a pitfall. There awaited him 
there precisely the influences to folly which he was least able to 
resist. He loved being loved, and was the man to think the gift 
a debt. He had an insatiable appetite for praise. With those 
weaknesses of character which caused Lord Minto, who yet 
never ceased to regard him with sincere friendship, to say that 
he was in some respects a " baby," he was disarmed in the 
presence of the two women who now made a determined attempt 
to capture him. Emma Hamilton, who could not help endeavour- 
ing to conquer every man she met, was naturally eager to 
dominate one who had filled Europe with his fame. Behind 
Emma was the queen of Naples, Maria Carolina, a woman who 
had a share of the ability of her mother Maria Theresa without 
any of her fine moral qualities. Maria Carolina was all her life 
trying to fight the power of revolutionary France, with no better 
resources than were afforded her by the insignificant kingdom 
of Naples, and a husband who was the embodiment of all the 
faults of the Italian Bourbons. She had made use of the English 
minister's wife as an instrument of political intrigue, and now 
she employed her to manage Nelson. We have the repeated 
assertions of Nelson himself in all his ample correspondence 
from September 1798 to July of 1800, and indeed later; to prove 
that he was, in his own tell-tale phrase, persuaded to "Sicilyfy" 
his conscience — in other words to turn his squadron into an 
instrument for the ambition, the revenge and the fears of Maria 
Carolina, the " Dear Queen " of his letters to Emma Hamilton. 
It is highly probable that he was secretly influenced by annoyance 
at the pedantry of the British government, which only gave him 
a barony for the splendid victory of the Nile, en the ridiculous 
ground that no higher title could be given to an officer who was 
not a commander-in-chief. All doubt as to the character of 
his relations with Lady Hamilton has been laid at rest by the 
Morrison papers. None ought ever to have existed, for, if Nelson 
did not love this woman in the fullest possible sense of the word, 
his conduct would be inexplicable on any other hypothesis than 
that he was an imbecile. He allowed her to waste his money, 
to lead him about " like a bear," and to drag him into gambling, 
which he naturally hated. For her sake he offended old friends, 
and quarrelled with his wife in circumstances of vulgar brutality. 
That he believed she had borne him a child can no longer be 
disputed, and he carried on with her a correspondence under the 
name of Thompson which was apparently meant to deceive 
her husband, but is varied by grotesque explosions which destroy 
the illusion, such as it was. 

In the hands of these two women, and in the intoxicatidn 
produced on him by flattery, which could not be too copious 
or gross for his taste, Nelson speedily became a Neapolitan 
royalist of far greater sincerity than was to be found among the 
king's subjects except in the ranks of the Lazzaroni. He 
gratified the headlong queen by egging her torpid husband into 
an exceedingly foolish attack on the French garrisons then 



occupying the so-called Roman republic. The collapse of the 
Neapolitan forces was instant and ignominious. The court 
fled to Palermo in December, under the protection of the British 
squadron. At Palermo Nelson remained directing the operations 
of the ships engaged in blockading Malta, then held by the 
garrison placed in it by Napoleon when he took it on his way 
to Egypt, and sinking continually deeper into his slavery to 
Lady Hamilton, till the spring of the following year. He was 
then aroused by a double call. A royalist army led by the 
king's vicar-general, Fabrizio Ruffo (g.fl.), had succeeded in 
recovering the greater part of the. kingdom of Naples from the 
government set up by the French, and called, in the pedantic 
style of the revolutionary epoch, the Parthenopean republic. 
A French" fleet commanded by Admiral Bruix entered the 
Mediterranean. News of the appearance of Bruix reached 
Nelson just as he was about to sail for Naples with the heir 
apparent to co-operate with Ruffo and his " Christian Army." 
He immediately took steps to concentrate his ships, which had 
been reinforced by a small Portuguese squadron, at Marittimo 
on the western coast of Sicily, where he would be conveniently 
placed to meet the French, if they came, or to unite with the 
ships of Lord St Vincent. He was, however, half distraught 
between his sense of what was required by his duty to his own 
service and the obligations he had assumed towards the sove- 
reigns of Naples. In the end he resolved to sail for Naples, this 
time without the crown prince, in order to carry out a mission 
entrusted to him by the king. 

The story of Nelson's visit to Naples in the June of 1799 will 
probably remain a subject for perpetual discussion. His reputa- 
tion for humanity and probity is considered to depend on the 
view we take of his actions there and at this period. It is true 
that the relative importance of these episodes has been much 
diminished by the publication of the Morrison Papers, and 
that it has at all times been exaggerated. From the Morrison 
Papers we know that, when his passions were concerned, he 
was not incapable of stratagems to deceive his old friend Sir 
William Hamilton. It is the less incredible that he should have 
been willing to use deceit against persons whom he hated so 
fiercely as he did the Neapolitan Jacobins, in his double quality 
of English Tory and Neapolitan Royalist. But apart from his 
laxity in the course of a double adultery, his letters, written to 
many different people during his stay on the coasts of Naples, 
contain more than sufficient evidence to show that he was utterly 
unhinged by excitement, and was unable to estimate the real 
character of many of his own words and deeds. He considered 
himself as owing an equal allegiance to Ferdinand of Naples 
and to his own sovereign. His feelings towards the Jacobin 
subjects of his Italian king are expressed in terms which bear 
a remarkable likeness to the rhetoric of the Jacobins of France 
when they were most vigorously engaged in ridding their country 
of aristocrats. To Troubridge he writes: "Send me word 
some proper heads are taken off, this alone will comfort me." 
To St Vincent he reports that "Our friend Troubridge had a 
present made him the other day of the head of a Jacobin, and 
makes an apology to me, the weather being very hot, for not 
sending it here." Some allowance may be made for a rude taste 
in jocularity, but it is impossible to mistake the scream of fury 
in Nelson's letters, imitated from the style of Lady Hamilton, 
who in these things was the sycophant of the queen. A man 
who allowed his thoughts to dwell in an atmosphere of hysterical 
ferocity, and was above all a man of action, was well on the way 
to interpret his words into deeds. It was while he was in this 
heated state that he was sent to preside over the fall of the 
Parthenopean republic at the end of June 1799. 

King Ferdinand had not been unwilling to offer terms to 
those of his subjects who had joined with the French to establish 
the republic, so long as he was under the influence of fear. 
But when the French had been defeated in northern Italy 
and had left the Republicans to their own resources, he became 
more anxious to make an example. In the early parts of June 
he heard that Ruffo was inclined tc clemency, and grew very 
eager to prevent any such mistake. No more effectual way of 



35& 



NELSON 



enforcing rigour could be imagined than to put the control 
of events entirely in the hands of Nelson, whose sentiments were 
well known, who was notoriously under the influence of Emma 
Hamilton, that is to say, of the queen, and who, as a stranger, 
would have no family or social attachments with the republicans, 
no changes of fortune nor future revenges to fear. That he asked 
Nelson to go to Naples, giving him large powers, may be con- 
sidered certain. A commission in the full sense he could not 
give without the consent of the king of Great Britain, and that 
was not even asked for. But Nelson had general instructions 
from home to support the Neapolitan government, and though 
this only meant, and could only mean, as an ally and against the 
common enemy, he understood it in a much wider sense, while 
he considered himself as being bound to Ferdinand in the relation 
of subject to sovereign by the grant of the duchy of Bronte in 
Sicily, which he had just received. He therefore sailed to 
Naples resolved to act in the double capacity of English and 
Neapolitan admiral, of English opponent of the Jacobins, 
and of Neapolitan royalist. The general cause of Europe and 
the particular revenge of the king and queen were of equal 
importance to him. When he entered the Bay of Naples on the 
24th of June he found that a capitulation had been agreed upon 
some thirty-six hours earlier, between Ruffo, acting as vicar- 
general, with the consent of Captain Foote (1 767-1833) of the 
" Seahorse," the -senior British naval officer present, on the 
one side, and the Neapolitan republicans on the other. The 
republicans had been reduced to the possession of the castles of 
Uovo and Nuovo, and had been glad to secure terms which 
allowed them to go into exile in France. Nelson denounced an 
arrangement which would have precluded all cutting off of 
heads as " infamous." He ordered the white flag to be hauled 
down on the "^Seahorse," and told Ruffo that he would not 
allow the capitulation to be carried out. The same warning 
was given to the republicans in the forts. There is a question 
whether the capitulation had been in part already carried into 
effect. Sir William Hamilton, who, together with his wife, had 
accompanied Nelson from Palermo, asserts that it had, in an 
official despatch to Lord Grenville dated on the 14th July. 
But this letter, written only a fortnight after the transaction, 
contains many inaccuracies, and can be held to prove only that 
Hamilton would have seen nothing discreditable in violating 
a capitulation, or that he was in his dotage, and did not know 
what he was doing. Ruffo refused to be a party to a breach of 
faith. On the afternoon of the 25th he had an interview with 
Nelson on board the flagship the "Foudroyant," which was con- 
ducted through the Hamiltons and was of a very heated character. 
Next morning, as Ruffo showed a determination to stand aside 
and throw on Nelson the responsibility of provoking a renewal 
of hostilities, messages were sent to him both by the admiral 
and by Hamilton that there would be no interference with the 
"armistice." This assurance put a stop to the dispute between 
them. The republicans came out of the forts and were trans- 
ferred to feluccas under the guard of British marines, where they 
were kept till the king's pleasure was known. As a matter of 
course it was that they should be mostly hanged or shot . Whether 
Nelson meant to deceive Ruffo into thinking that he had accepted 
the capitulation when he named the armistice, — whether the 
vicar-general was deceived, and then misled the garrisons in good 
faith — or whether he knew perfectly well that the capitulation 
was not included, and took the opportunity afforded him by 
these two English gentlemen to deceive his own countrymen, 
are points much discussed. The republicans in the forts did claim 
that they were covered by the capitulation, and that it had been 
violated. It is difficult to see in what way the service of King 
George was forwarded by Nelson's zeal for King Ferdinand. 
Such discredit as fell on him would have been avoided if he had 
kept to his duty as British admiral, and had not thought it 
incumbent on him to prove himself a good Neapolitan royalist. 
On the 2Qth of June Francesco Caracciolo (q.v.), a Neapolitan 
naval officer who had joined the republicans, was brought to 
Nelson as a prisoner. Out of his desire to make an example 
of a proper head, and in the full knowledge that Caracciolo's 



death would be pleasing to the queen, Nelson, in virtue, seemingly, 
of his supposed commission as Neapolitan admiral (which he 
did not possess), ordered a court martial of Italian officers to'sit, 
on an English ship, to try the prisoner. The court could only 
find him guilty, and Caracciolo was hanged. The sentence was 
just, but the procedure was indecent, and Nelson's intervention 
cannot be justified. 

At this period of his life it is indeed difficult to represent 
Nelson's actions in a favourable light. In July he disobeyed the 
order of Lord Keith to send some of his ships to Minorca, on 
the ground that they were needed for the defence of Naples. 
The influence of the queen, exercised through Emma Hamilton 
was partly responsible for his wilfulness, but a great deal must 
be put down to his annoyance at finding that Keith, and not he 
himself, was to succeed St Vincent as commander-in-chief in 
the Mediterranean. After the victory of the Nile he became, 
in fact, incapable of acting as a subordinate. Until he left for 
home in June 1800, except during the short interval when he 
acted as commander-in-chief in the absence of Keith, he was 
captious, querulous and avoided leaving Palermo as much as he 
could, and far more than he ought. When forced out he made 
his health an excuse for going back. He began a quarrel with 
Troubridge which ripened into complete estrangement. He 
wearied out his friends at the Admiralty, and finally extorted 
leave to return. As Keith would not allow him to take a line 
of battleship for his journey home with the Hamiltons, and 
indeed said plainly that Lady Hamilton had commanded the 
Mediterranean station long enough, he returned across Europe 
with his friends. Accounts of the figure they cut, and the 
sensation they created at Vienna and at Dresden, can be found 
in the Minto correspondence, and in the reminiscences of Mrs 
St George, afterwards Mrs Trench (1 768-1827). He reached 
home in November. 

In England he was received with the utmost popular en- 
thusiasm, but with coldness by the king, the Admiralty, and by 
the great official and social world. His erratic and self-willed 
conduct towards Lord Keith sufficiently explains the distrust 
shown by My Lords of the Admiralty. Their uneasiness was not 
diminished by their knowledge that his renown made it quite 
impossible to lay him aside at a crisis. The king, a man of strict 
domestic habits and strong religious convictions, was un- 
doubtedly offended by the scandals of Nelson's life at Naples, and 
he cannot but have been displeased by the admiral's openly 
avowed readiness to devote himself to King Ferdinand. English 
society as represented by the First Lord, Lord Spencer, and his 
wife, may not have shared the moral indignation of the pious 
king; but their taste was offended, and so was their self-respect, 
when Nelson insisted on forcing Lady Hamilton on them, and 
would go nowhere where she was not received. When it was 
discovered that he insisted on making his wife live in the same 
house as his mistress, he was considered to have infringed the 
accepted standard of good manners. After enduring insult at 
once cruel and cowardly, to the verge of poorness of spirit, 
Lady Nelson rebelled. A complete separation took place, and 
husband and wife never met again. 

On the 1st of January 1801 Nelson became vice-admiral by 
seniority. The alliance of the Northern powers of which the Tsar 
Paul was the inspiring spirit, made it necessary for the British 
government to take vigorous measures in its own defence. A 
fleet had to be sent on a very difficult and dangerous mission 
to the Baltic. The Admiralty would have been unpardonable, 
and would not have been excused by public opinion if, when it 
had at its disposal such an admirable weapon as the conqueror 
of the Nile, it had failed to employ him. Nelson was chosen to 
go as a matter of course, but unfortunately, it was thought proper 
to put him under the command of Sir Hyde Parker (q.v.) an 
officer of no experience, and, as the Admiralty ought to have 
known, of commonplace, not to say indolent, character. Nelson 
bore the subordination with many bitter complaints, but on the 
whole with patience and tact. Sir Hyde Parker began by 
keeping his formidable second in command at arm's length, 
but Nelson handled him with considerable diplomacy. Knowing

his superior to be fond of good living he caused a turbot to be 
caught for him on the Dogger Bank, and sent it to him with 
a complimentary message. Sir Hyde was not insensible to the 
attention, and thawed notably. We have the good fortune to 
possess the notes taken during the campaign by Colonel Stewart 
(1774-1827), a military officer who did duty with Nelson as a 
marine. Colonel Stewart has put on record many stories of 
Nelson which have a high biographical value. He saw the hero 
when his character was displayed in all its strength and its weak- 
ness. Nelson was at once burning for honour, ardently desirous 
to serve his country at a great crisis, and yet longing for rest and 
for the company of Emma Hamilton. His passion had, if possible, 
been increased by the birth of the child Horatia, whom he 
believed to be his own, and his jealousy was excited by fears that 
Emma would become an object of attention to the prince of 
Wales (afterwards George IV.). His health, as Colonel Stewart 
justly observed, was always affected by anxiety, and during the 
Baltic campaign he complained incessantly of his sufferings. 
Nervous irritation provoked him into odd explosions of excite- 
ment, as when, for instance, he suddenly interfered with the work- 
ing of his flagship while the officer of the watch was tacking 
her on the south coast of England, and so threw her into disorder. 
When he saw the consequences of his untimely intrusion he 
sharply appealed to the officer to tell him what was to be done 
next, and when the embarrassed lieutenant hesitated to reply, 
burst out with, " If you do not know, I am sure I don't," and 
then went into his cabin. His subordinates learnt to take these 
manifestations as matters of course, knowing that they were 
wholly without malignity. To them he was always kind, even 
when they were at fault, taking, as his own phrase has it, a 
penknife where Lord St Vincent would have taken a hatchet. 
Colonel Stewart tells how he was wont to invite the midshipmen 
of the middle watch to breakfast, and romp, with them as if 
he had been the youngest of the party. The playfulness of his 
nature came out, in combination with his heroism, when he 
adorned his refusal to obey Sir Hyde's weak signal of recall in the 
middle of the battle, which would have been disastrous if it had 
been acted on, by putting his telescope to his blind eye and 
declaring that he could not see,, the order to retire. At such 
moments all could see his agitation; but, as the surgeon of the 
" Elephant," which bore his flag at Copenhagen, says, they could 
also see that " it was not the agitation of indecision, but of 
ardent animated patriotism panting for glory." When Sir Hyde 
Parker was recalled in May, Nelson assumed the command in 
the Baltic; but the dissolution of the Northern Confederation 
left him little to do. His health really suffered in the cold air 
of high latitudes, and in June he obtained leave to come home. 
His services were grudgingly recognized by the title of viscount. 
During the brief interval before the peace he was put in command 
of a flotilla to combat Napoleon's futile threat of invasion. 
In the hope of quieting public anxiety rather than in any serious 
expectation of success, an attack was made on a French flotilla 
strongly protected by its position, at Boulogne, which was 
disastrously repulsed. Nelson was not in command on the spot, 
and if he had been would in all probability have renewed his 
experience at Santa Cruz. He could not do the impossible more 
than other men. He was only more ready to try. 

While the brief peace made at Amiens lasted, he remained on 
shore. His home was with the Hamiltons in the strange house- 
hold in which Sir William showed that his 18th-century training 
had taught him to accept a domestic division with a good grace, 
and had not left him too squeamish to profit by the pecuniary 
advantages which may attend the relation of complacent 
husband. His death on the 6th of April 1803 made no change 
in the life of the admiral. He lived almost wholly at Merton, 
where he had purchased a small house, which Emma filled with 
memorials of his glory and of her now passing beauty. She fed 
him profusely with the flattery which he, in Lord Minto's words, 
swallowed as a child does pap; and she was in turn adored by 
him, and treated with profound deference by his family, with 
the exception of his father. 

When the ambition of Napoleon made it impossible to keep 



up the fiction of peace, Nelson was at once called from retirement, 
and this time there could be no question of putting him under 
the authority of any other admiral. He was appointed to the 
Mediterranean command, and hoisted his flag in May 1803. 
Between this date and his death in the hour of full triumph on 
the 21st of October 1805, he was in the centre and was one of 
the controlling spirits of the vast military and naval drama 
which after filling for more than two years the immense stage 
bounded by Europe and the West Indies, found its closing scene 
in Trafalgar Bay (see Trafalgar). In spite of the anxieties 
of an arduous command Nelson was serene and at his best in this 
last period of his life. Once only did the ill-advised boasting 
of Latouche Treville provoke him into a scolding mood. The 
French officer spoke of him as having fled before his French 
ships, and the vaunt, which had no better foundation than that 
Nelson had retired before superior numbers when reconnoitring, 
exasperated him into threatening to make the Frenchman eat 
his letter if ever they met. Nelson could boast, but his loudest 
words are not ridiculously out of proportion to his deeds. 

The last hours at Trafalgar will never be forgotten by English- 
men. There is no figure in English history at once so magnificent 
in battle, and so penetrating in its appeal to the emotions, as 
was Nelson on that last day when under his leadership the fleet 
annihilated the last lingering fear that Napoleon would ever 
carry his desolating arms into the British Islands'. It matters 
little that the woman of whom he thought to the last was utterly 
unworthy of him, had perhaps never rendered the services he 
supposed her to have done for their country, and was about to dis- 
honour his memory by mercenary immorality. He must be worse 
than censorious who can think unmoved of Nelson kneeling in 
prayer by his cabin table as the " Victory " rolled slowly down 
on the enemy on the 21st of October, appealing to God for help, 
and writing the codicil in which he left his mistress and his child 
to the gratitude of his country. 

It is said that his famous signal was to have been worded 
" Nelson confides that every man will do his duty," and that 
his own name was replaced by that of England on the suggestion 
of one of his officers. The use of his name as an inspiration and 
an appeal would have been perfectly consistent with his tone 
at all times, but he agreed to the alteration with the indifference 
of a man to whom self and country were one at that hour. 
" Expects " replaced " confides that " because the signal 
lieutenant Pascoe pointed out to him that the verb originally 
chosen must be spelt out letter by letter in a long string of 
flags. He parted with Captain Blackwood of the " Euryalus " 
with a prophecy of his approaching fate. The sight of Colling- 
wood, the friend of his youth, leading the lee line into action 
in the " Royal Sovereign " drew from him a cry of admiration 
at the noble example his comrade was showing. When the 
" Victory " had passed astern of the French " Bucentaure," 
and was engaged with her and the " Redoubtable," he walked 
up and down the quarter deck of his flagship by the side of his 
flag-captain, T. M. Hardy, with the brisk short step customary 
with him. As they turned, a musket shot from the top of the 
" Redoubtable " struck him on the upper breast, and, plunging 
down, broke the spine. "They have done for me at last!" 
were the words in which he acknowledged the fatal stroke. He 
lingered for a very few hours of anguish in the fetid cockpit of 
the " Victory," amid the horrors of darkness relieved only by the 
dim light of lanterns, and surrounded by men groaning, or 
raving with unbearable pain. The shock of the broadsides made 
the whole frame of the " Victory " tremble, and extorted a 
moan from the dying admiral. When Captain Hardy came down 
to report the progress of the battle, his inherent love for full 
triumph drew from him the declaration that less than twenty 
prizes would not satisfy him. He clung to his authority to the 
end. The suggestion that Collingwood would have to decide 
on the course to be taken was answered with the eager claim, 
" Not while I live. " But the last recorded words were of 
affection and of duty. He begged Hardy for a kiss, and he 
ended with the proud and yet humble claim, " I have done my 
duty, thank God for that."

NELSON 



His body was brought home in his flagship and laid to rest 
in St Paul's. He is commemorated in London by the monu- 
ment in Trafalgar Square, completed in 1849 with a colossal 
statue by E. K. Baily, and surrounded by Landseer's bronze 
lions, added in 1867. 

In estimating the character of Nelson, and his achievements, 
there are some elements which must be allowed for more fully 
than has always been the case. He was, to begin with, the 
least English of great Englishmen. He had the excitability, the 
vanity, the desire for approbation without much delicacy as 
to the quarter from which it came, which the average Eng- 
lishman of Nelson's time, his judgment obscured by the effects 
of centuries of racial rivalry culminating in the Napoleonic 
wars, was wont to attribute to Frenchmen. Where there 
is vanity there is the capacity for spite and envy. Nor was 
Nelson altogether free from these unpleasant faults. But in 
the main his desire to be liked combined with a natural kindness 
of disposition to make him appeal frankly to the goodwill 
of those about him. He won to a very great extent the affec- 
tion he valued, and that from men so widely different in char- 
acter as Lord Minto and the simple-hearted seamen among 
whom he passed the best part of his life. He could be cruel 
when his emotions were aroused hyevil influences, with the 
downright cruelty he displayed at Naples, or the more subtle 
form of hardness in his conduct to his wife, when his duty 
to her stood in the way of his love for Emma Hamilton. But 
they -were few to whom the evil side of his nature was shown, 
while the captains and seamen for whom he did much to make 
a hard duty more tolerable were to be counted by the thousand. 

As a commander he belonged to the race of Pyrrhus and the 
prince of Conde — the {jghters of battles. His victories were 
won at the head of a force which had been brought to a high 
level of efficiency by three generations of predecessors, against 
enemies who had been, as in the case of the French, disorganized 
by a social revolution which had ruined their discipline, who 
were inexperienced as the Danes were, or who, as in the case of 
the Spaniards, were sunk in a moral and intellectual decadence. 
But he estimated the vices of his opponents with full insight. 
Wielding a fine instrument, and confronted by inferior enemies, 
he was entitled to dare much, and it is a proof of his sagacity 
that he saw how far he could dare, caring but little for the bulk 
of the force in front of him, and looking to the spirit. Above 
all, he had the power to inspire the enthusiasm he felt, and to 
make men act above themselves because he was there, and because 
they found a joy in pleasing him. Among all the warriors of 
his generation Napoleon alone was a greater master of the souls 
of men, and Blucher alone came near him. 

Nelson had no children by his wife. His daughter Horatia, 
by Lady Hamilton, became the wife of the Rev. Philip Ward, 
and died in 1881. In November 1805, in recognition of Nelson's 
great services to his country, his brother William (1757-1835) 
was created Earl Nelson of Trafalgar, an annuity of £5000 being 
attached to the title. When William died without sons in 
February 1835 his only daughter Charlotte Mary (1787-1873), 
wife of Samuel Hood, 2nd Baron Bridport (1 788-1868), became 
duchess of Bronte, while, according to the remainder, his English 
titles passed to his nephew Thomas Bolton (1 786-1835), who 
became 2nd Earl Nelson. Bolton, who took the name of Nelson, 
was succeeded as 3rd Earl Nelson in November 1835 by his 
son Horatio (b. 1823). The duchy of Bronte was in 1910 held 
by Baroness Bridport's grandson, Arthur Wellington Nelson 
Hood, 2nd Viscount Bridport (b. 1839). 

Authorities. — Very much has been written about Nelson/ A 
large part of the total mass consists of hasty work done to meet an 
immediate demand, or of repetition not justified by the critical 
faculty or literary skill of the writers. The valuable portion may be 
divided into original authorities, such as correspondence, and the 
testimony of eyewitnesses; and the narratives or criticisms of 
students who tell with original power, and judge with knowledge and 
insight. Under the heading of original authorities, the first place is 
taken by The Dispatches and Letters of Vice-Admiral Lord Viscount 
Nelson, with notes by Sir N. H. Nicolas (7 vols., 1844-1846). Nicolas 
spared no pains to make his collection complete and to illustrate it 
from all trustworthy sources. Thus he includes Sir Edward Berry's 
Account of the Battle of the Nile, Colonel Stewart's Notes on the Copen- 



hagen Campaign, Dr Beatey's Narrative of Nelson* s Last Hours, and 
passages from the so-called Reminiscences of the Captain of the 
Victory, Dr Scott. This last authority is of little value, for the book 
consists of recollections by Dr Scott's daughter and son-in-law of 
what he said years after the events he was speaking of. The student 
of Nelson's life should make it a rule to exhaust Nicolas before con- 
sulting any other authority. A collection of Letters from Nelson to 
Emma Hamilton was published under her direction in 1814, but it is 
subject to much suspicion. A great mass of correspondence of the 
Hamiltons and much MS. relating to Nelson came into the hands of 
Dr Pettigrew, and passed into the possession of Mr A. Morrison, 
from whose collection they were transferred to the British Museum. 
A catalogue, in which the text is given, was privately printed and 
can be consulted in the museum. Isolated letters have appeared 
from time to time. Between February and April 1898 some valuable 
extracts from his correspondence with his wife, previously un- 
known, and the correct text of parts of his diary, appeared in the 
extinct weekly, Literature. Among the lives of Nelson's contem- 
poraries, J. S. Tucker's Earl of St Vincent (1844), Ross's Saumarez, 
Lady Bourchier's Codrington and the Letters of Sir William Hoste 
throw light on particular points. The Nelsonxan Reminiscences of 
Parsons give an interesting picture of the admiral as he appeared 
to an observant boy. The observations of older and more intelligent 
witnesses will be found in The Diaries and Correspondence of George 
Rose, in The Life and Letters of the First Earl of Minto and in a 
Journal kept during a Visit to Germany, by Mrs St George, afterwards 
Mrs Trench. Incidental mentions of Nelson are to be found in the 
Paget Papers, the correspondence of the minister who succeeded 
Sir W. Hamilton at the court of Naples. Biographies of Nelson are 
numerous. Emma Hamilton inspired one by a Mr Harrison, an 
odious book which was in reality an advertisement of herself and 
which appeared in 1806. The two quartos of Clarke and McArthur 
(1809), reprinted in three volumes octavo in 1840, were based on 
papers supplied by the family, but the texts were edited with un- 
pardonable freedom and the originals have in many cases been lost. 
Southey's classic'Zi/e was based on Clarke and McArthur. All later 
biographies have been superseded by Captain Mahan'sLVfe of Nelson, 
first published in two volumes in 1897 and again in one volume, 
with additions and corrections in 1899. The much-debated Nea- 
politan episode has given rise to a literature of its own. The con- 
troversy began with the appearance of Captain Foote's Vindication 
of his own part in the transaction published in 1810. It drew an 
immediate Counter Vindication of Nelson by Commander Jeaffreson 
Miles. Italian versions will be found in Sacchinelli's Fabrizio Ruffo 
and in the Compendio of Micheroux edited by theMarcheseMaresca. 
The controversy has been revived in England by Mr F. F. Badham 
with his Nelson at Naples (1900). and has provoked the publication 
of a collection of the documents by the Navy Record Society, in 
vol. xxv. of their publications,* under the title Nelson and the 
Neapolitan Jacobins (1903). Mr C. Jeaffreson 's two works, Lady 
Hamilton and Lord Nelson (1888) and the Queen of Naples and 
Lord Nelson (1889), are based on the papers collected by Mr 
Morrison. See also T. Nelson, Genealogical History of the Nelson 
Family (1908). (D. H.) 

NELSON, ROBERT (1656-1715), English philanthropist and 
religious writer, son of John Nelson, a London merchant, was 
born on the 22nd of June 1656, and was educated as the private 
pupil of George Bull, afterwards bishop of St David's. Having 
inherited a considerable fortune from his father, he followed 
no profession. About 1680 he went abroad and spent much 
time on the continent of Europe till 1691, when he settled at 
Blackheath. For many years he was an intimate friend and 
correspondent of Archbishop Tillotson, though not in agreement 
with his views; and he was also on terms of friendship with 
the astronomer Halley and other men of science. Nelson's 
sympathies were with the Jacobites; and after his return to 
England he associated himself with the nonjurors, under whose 
influence he produced several of his writings on religious subjects. 
He was an active supporter of the Society for Promoting Christian 
Knowledge, the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, 
and similar associations, and he used his influence largely in 
the establishment of charity schools and the building of churches 
in London. In 1687 he had published a controversial work 
against transubstantiation, and in 1704 appeared his Companion 
for the Festivals and Fasts of the Church of England, which 
obtained a remarkable popularity lasting till the middle of the 
19th century. Within five years of its publication ten thousand 
copies of the Companion were printed, and thirty-six editions 
appeared in a hundred and twenty years. After the death oi 
Bishop Bull in 17 10 Nelson wrote his biography, which was 
published three years later; and he was also the author of many 
other devotional and controversial works. He died in January

NELSON, a river of Keewatin district, Canada, discharging 
the waters of Lake Winnipeg in a north-easterly direction into 
Hudson Bay. It drains an area of 360,000 sq. m. and, including 
its tributary the Saskatchewan, is 1450 m. long. It is navigable 
for small steamers for a distance of about 80 m., after which it 
is unnavigable except for canoes. It has a total fall between the 
lake and sea of 7 10 ft. Here its chief tributary is the Burnt wood. 
Norway House at its source and York Factory at its mouth 
are important stations of the Hudson's Bay Company. 

NELSON, a town of British Columbia, situated on the west arm 
of Kootenay lake. Pop. (1006) about 5000. It is the com- 
mercial, administrative and railroad centre of the east and west 
Kootenay districts. It is the northern terminus of a branch of 
the Great Northern railway and is also connected by rail and 
steamboat with the main line of the Canadian Pacific railway at 
Revels toke and with the Crow's Nest line of the same system at 
Kootenay landing. It has direct railway communication with 
Rossland, Grand Forks and Greenwood. 

NELSON, a municipal borough in the Clitheroe parliamentary 
division of Lancashire, England, 32 \ m. N. from Manchester by 
the Lancashire & Yorkshire railway. Pop. (1891) 22,754, 
(1 901) 32,816. It is of modern growth, possessing a town hall, 
market hall, free library, technical school, pleasant park and 
recreation grounds, and an extensive system of electric tramways 
and light railways, connecting with Burnley and Colne. Its 
chief manufacture is cotton. It was incorporated in 1800, and 
the corporation consists of 'a mayor, 6 aldermen and 18 
councillors. Area, 3466 acres. 

NELSON, a seaport of New Zealand, the seat of a bishop and 
capital of a provincial district of the same name; at the head 
of Blind Bay on the northern coast of the South Island. Pop. 
(1906) 8164. The woods and fields in the neighbourhood abound 
with English song-birds, and the streams are stocked with trout; 
while the orchards in the town and suburbs are famous for English 
kinds of fruit, and hops are extensively cultivated. The town 
possesses a small museum and art gallery, literary institute, 
government buildings, and boys' and girls' schools of high repute. 
The cathedral (Christ Church) is finely placed on a mound which 
was originally intended as a place of refuge from hostile natives. 
It is built of wood, the various native timbers being happily 
combined. Railways connect the harbour with the town, and 
the town with Motupiko, &c. The harbour, with extensive 
wharves, is protected by the long and remarkable Boulder Bank, 
whose southern portion forms the natural breakwater to that 
anchorage. The settlement was planted by the New Zealand 
Company in 1842. The borough returns one member to the 
house of representatives, and its local affairs are administered 
by a mayor and council. 

NELSONVILLE, a city of Athens county, Ohio, U.S.A., on the 
Hocking river, 62 m. S.E. of Columbus. Pop.(r8oo) 4558, (rooo) 
5421, including 328 foreign-born and 204 negroes; (1910) 6082. 
Nelsonville is served by the Hocking Valley railway. The 
city is in one of the most productive coal sections of the state; 
there are large quantities of clay in the vicinity; and the principal 
industries are the mining and shipping of coal and the manu- 
facture of fire-clay products. Nelsonville was settled in 1818 
and was incorporated in 1838; it was named in honour of Elisha 
Nelson, who built the first house here. 

NEMATODA, in zoology, a group of worms. The name Nema- 
toda (Gr. wj/ra, thread, and €t5os, form) was first introduced by 
Rudolphi, but the group had been previously recognized as 
distinct by Zeder under the name Ascarides. They are now by 



its 



many systematists united with the Acanthocephala and the 
Nematomorpha to form the group Nemathelminthes. 

The Nematoda possess an elongated and thread-like form (see 
fig. 1), varying in length from a few lines up to several feet. The 
body is covered externally by a chitinous cuticle which is a 
product of the subjacent epidermic layer in which no cell limits 
can be detected though nuclei are scattered through it. The 
cuticle is frequently prolonged into spines and papillae, which 
are especially developed at the anterior end of the body. The 
mouth opens at one extremity of the body and the anus at or 
near the other. Beneath the epidermis is A 

a longitudinal layer of muscle-fibres which 
are separated into four distinct groups 
by the dorsal, ventral and lateral areas; 
these are occupied by a continuation of the 
epidermic layer; in the lateral areas run 
two thin-walled tubes with clear contents, 
which unite in the anterior part of the 
body and open by a pore situated on the 
ventral surface usually about a quarter 
or a third of the body length from the 
anterior end. These vessels are the nitrogen- 
ous excretory organs. The body-cavity is 
largely occupied by processes from the large 
muscle cells of the skin. These processes 
stretch across the body cavity to be inserted 
in the dorsal and ventral middle lines. 

The body-cavity also contains the so- 
called phagocytic organs. These consist 
of enormous cells with nuclei so large as 
to be in some cases just visible to the naked 
eye. These cells are disposed in pairs, 
though the members of each pair are not 
always at the same level. The number of 
cells is not large (some 2 to 8), and as a 
rule they lie along the lateral lines. In 
some species (Ascaris decipiens) the giant 
cell is ^replaced by an irregular mass of 
protoplasm containing a number of small 
nuclei. Such a Plasmodium bears, on its 
periphery, groups of rounded projections 
of protoplasm termed end-organs. Similarly 
the giant cells are produced at their peri- 
phery into a number of branching pro- 
cesses which bear similar end-organs on 
their surface and in some cases terminate MttT Galeb> Arch & 
in them. These end-organs are the active Zooi - Ez p-> 1878.

bacteria, which may have found their way &» Mout h. 
into the fluid of the body-cavity. From i e J ^T?™!^ 
the shape and position of the phagocytic 
organs it is obvious that they form admir- 
able strainers through which the fluid of 
the body-cavity filters (figs. 2, 3). 

The alimentary tract consists of a 
straight tube running from the mouth to 
the anus without any convolutions; it is 
separable into three divisions: (1) a mus- 
cular oesophagus, which is often provided t e%

tine; and (3) a short terminal rectum S P* Cloaca, 
surrounded by muscular fibres. Neither *°» Papillae, 
here nor elsewhere are cilia found at any period of develop- 
ment. 

A nervous system has been shown to exist in many species, 
and consists of a perioesophageal ring giving off usually six nerves 
which run forwards and backwards along the lateral and median 
lines; these are connected by numerous fine, circular threads in 
the sub-cuticle. Some of the free-living forms possess eye specks. 
The sexes are distinct (with the exception of a few forms that are 
hermaphrodite), and the male is always smaller than the female. 
The generative organs consist of one or two tubes, in the upper

portion of which the ova 'or spermatozoa are developed, the lower 
portion serving as an oviduct or vas deferens; the female gener- 
ative organs open at the middle of the body, the male close to 
the posterior extremity into the terminal portion of the ali- 
mentary canal; from this cloaca a diverticulum is given off in 
which are developed one to three chitinous spicules that subserve 
the function of copulation. The spermatozoa differ from those 
of other animals in having the form of cells which sometimes 
perform amoeboid movements. Most remarkable sexual condi- 
tions are found to occur in the free-living genera Rhabditis and

Diplogaster. While some of the species are bisexual, others are 
protandrous, self-fertilizing hermaphrodites. In cultures of the 
latter there occur very rare supplemental males which appear in 
no sense degenerate but as fit for reproduction as the males of the 
bisexual species. Though possessing a complete copulatory 
apparatus and producing large quantities of spermatozoa, they 
have lost their sexual instinct and play no part in the economy 
of the species. These " psychically decadent " individuals 
appear to represent the entire male sex of a bisexual species, 
and become unnecessary owing to the grafting of hermaphrodit- 
ism on the female sex. 
Mode of Life and Metamorphoses—While the majority of the 



Nematodes arc parasites, there are many that are never at any 
period of their life parasitic. These free-living forms are found 
everywhere — in salt and fresh water, in damp earth and moss, 
and among decaying substances; they are always minute in size, 
and like many other lower forms of life, are capable of retaining 
their vitality for a long period even when dried, which accounts 
for their wide distribution; this faculty is also possessed by 
certain of the parasitic Nematodes, especially by those which 
lead a free existence during a part of their life-cycle. The free- 
living differ from the majority of the parasitic forms in under- 
going no metamorphosis; they also possess certain structural 
peculiarities which led Bastian (Trans. Linn, Soc, 1865) to 
separate them into a distinct family, the Anguillulidae. It is 
impossible, however, to draw a strict line of demarcation between 
the free and parasitic species, since — (1) many of the so-called free 
Nematoda live in the slime of molluscs (Villot), and are therefore 
really parasitic; (2) while certain species belonging to the free- 
living genus Anguillula are normally parasitic (e.g. A. tritici, 
which lives encysted in ears of wheat), other species occasionally 
adopt the parasitic mode of existence, and become encysted in 
slugs, snails, &c; (3) it has been experimentally proved that 
many normally parasitic genera are capable of leading a free 
existence; 1 (4) transitional forms exist which are free at one 
period of their life and parasitic at another. The parasitic 
Nematodes include by far the greatest number of the known 
genera; they are found in nearly all the orders of the animal 
kingdom, but more especially among the Vertebrata, and of 
these the Mammalia are infested by a greater variety than any 
of the other groups. Some two dozen distinct species have been 
described as occurring in man. The Nematode parasites of the 
Invertebrata are usually immature forms which attain their full 
development in the body of some vertebrate; but there are a 
number of species which in the sexually adult condition are 
peculiar to the Invertebrata? 

The Nematoda contain about as many parasitic species as all 
the other groups of internal parasites taken together; they are 
found in almost all the organs of the body, and by their presence, 
especially when encysted in the tissues and during their migration 
from one part of the body to another, give rise to various patho- 
logical conditions. Although some attain their full development 
in the body of a single host — in this respect differing from all 
other Entozoa — the majority do not become sexually mature 
until after their transference from an " intermediate " to a 
" definitive " host. This migration is usually accompanied by 
a more or less complete metamorphosis, which is, however, not 
so conspicuous as in most other parasites, e.g. the Trem&toda. 
In some cases (many species of Ascaris) the metamorphosis is 
reduced to a simple process of growth. 

The parasitic and free-living Nematodes are connected by 
transitional forms which are free at one stage of their existence 
and parasitic at another; they may be divided into two classes — » 
those that are parasitic in the larval state but free when adult, 
and those that are free in the larval state but parasitic when 
adult. 

(1) To the first class belong the so-called " hairworm," Mermis, 
not to be confused < with the Gordian worms.' The adult forms of 
M. nigrescens live in damp earth and may be seen after storms or 
early in the morning crawling up the stalks of plants, a fact which 
causes people to talk about showers of worms. The eggs are laid on 



1 Ercolani successfully cultivated Oxyuris curvula, Strongylus 
armatus and other species in damp earth; the free generation was 
found to differ from the parasitic by its small size, and by the females 
being ovoviviparous instead of oviparous. To this phenomenon he 
gave the name of dimorphobiosis. 

2 The genera A scaris, Filaria, Trichosoma are found throughout the 
Vertebrate, Cucutlanus (in the adult condition) only in fishes and 
Amphibia; Ankylostama, Trichocephalus, Trichina and Pseudalius 
live only in the Mammalia, the last-mentioned genus being confined 
to the order Cetacea; Strongylus and Physaloptera are peculiar to 
mammals, birds and reptiles, while Dispharagus, Syngamus and 
Hystrichis are confined to birds. Mermis (in the larval state) is 
confined to the Invertebrata and Sphaerularia to bees. Oxyuris, 
though chiefly parasitic in the Mammalia, occurs also in reptiles, 
Amphibia and one or two insects. Dacnitis and Ichi'hyontma are 
only found in fishes.

the ground and the young larvae make their way into grasshoppers, 
in whose bodies they pass most of their larval life. (2) To the second 
class belong Ankylostoma, Strongylus and many species of Ascaris] 
the embryo on leaving the egg lives free in water or damp earth, and 
resembles very closely the free-living genus Khabditis. After a longer 
or shorter period it enters the alimentary canal of its proper host with 
drinking-water, or it bores through the skin and reaches the blood- 
vessels, and is so conveyed through the body, in which it becomes 
sexually mature. Rhabditis nigrovenosa has a developmental history 
which is entirely anomalous, passing through two sexual genera- 
tions which regularly alternate. The worm inhabits the lung of 
the frog and toad, and Is hermaphrodite (Schneider) or partheno- 
genetic (Leuckart) ; the embryos hatched from the eggs find their 
way through the lungs into the alimentary canal and thence to the 
exterior; in a few days they develop into a sexual larva, called a 
Rkabditiform larva, in which the sexes are distinct; the eggs remain 
within the uterus, and the young when hatched break through its 
walls and live free in the perivisceral cavity of the mother, devouring 
the organs of the body until only the outer cuticle is left; this eventu- 
ally breaks and sets free the young, which are without teeth, and 
have therefore lost the typical Rhabditis form. They live for some 
time in water or mud, occasionally entering the bodies of water 
snails, but undergo no change until they reach the lung of a frog, 
when the cycle begins anew. Although several species belonging to 
the second class occasionally enter the bodies of water snails and 
other animals before reaching their definitive host, they undergo no 
alteration of form in this intermediate host; the case is different, 
however, in Filaria medinensis and other forms, in which a free 
larval is followed by a parasitic existence in two distinct hosts, all 
the changes being accompanied by a metamorphosis. Filaria medi- 
nensis — the Guinea worm — is parasitic in the subcutaneous connec- 
tive tissue of man (occasionally also in the horse). It is chiefly 
found in the tropical parts of Asia and Africa, but has also been 
met with in South Carolina and several of the West Indian islands. 
The adult worm in the female sometimes reaches a length of 6 ft. 
The males have only recently been discovered. The female is vivi- 
parous, and the young, which, unlike the parent, are provided with 
a long tail, live free in water; it was formerly believed from the 
frequency with which the legs and feet were attacked by this parasite 
that the embryo entered the skin directly from the water, but it 
has been shown by Fedschenko, and confirmed by Manson, Leiper 
and others, that the larva bores its way into the body of a Cyclops 
and there undergoes further development. It is probable that the 
parasite is then transferred to the alimentary canal of man by means 
of drinking-water, and thence makes its way to the subcutaneous 
connective tissue. 

The Nematoda which are parasitic during their whole life may 
similarly be divided into two classes — those which undergo their 
development in a single host, and those which undergo their 
development in the bodies of two distinct hosts. 

(1) In the former class the eggs are extruded with the faeces, and 
the young become fully formed within the egg, and when accidentally 
swallowed by their host are liberated by the solvent action of the 
gastric juice and complete their development. This simple type of 
life-history has been experimentally proved by Leuckart to be 
characteristic of Trichocephalus affinis^ Oxyuris 
ambigua and other species. (2) The life-history 
of Ollulanus tricuspis is an example of the second 
class. OUulanus tricuspis is found in the adult 
state in the alimentary canal of the cat; the 
young worms are hatched in the alimentary 
canal, and often wander into the body of their 
host and become encysted in the lungs, liver and 
other organs; during the encystment the worm 
degenerates and loses all trace of structure. 
This wandering appears to be accidental, and to 
have nothing to do with the further evolution 
of the animal which takes place in those embryos 
which are voided with the excrement. Leuckart 
proved experimentally that these young forms 
become encysted in the muscles of mice, and 
the cycle is completed after the mouse is de- 
voured by a cat. The well-known Trichinella 
spiralis (fig. 4) has a life-history closely resembl- 
ing that of Ollulanus. The adult worm, which 
Fig. 4. — Trichin- is of extremely minute size, the male being only 
ella encysted ^th and the female | of an inch in length 

among muscular inhabits the alimentary canal of man and many 
fibres. (After other carnivorous mammalia; the young bore 

Leuckart.) their way into the tissues and become encysted 

in the muscles — within the muscle-bundles 
according to Leuckart, but in the connective tissue between them 
according to Chatin and others. The co-cxistcnce of the asexual 
encysted form and the sexually mature adult in the same host, 
exceptionally found in Ollulanus and other Nematodes, is the 
rule in Trichinella; many of the embryos, however, are extruded 
with the faeces, and complete the life cycle by reaching the alimentary 
canal of rats and swine which frequently devour human ordure 




Swine become infested with Trichinella in this way and also by eating 
the dead bodies of rats, and the parasite is conveyed to the body ol 
man along with the flesh of " trichinized " swine. 

Importance in Pathology. — Among recent advances having 
medical import in our knowledge of the Nematodes, the chief 
are those dealing with the parasites of the hlood. F. bancrojti is 
known to live in the lymphatic glands, and its embryos Micro- 
filaria sanguinis hominis nocluma, passing by the thoracic duct, 
reach the blood-vessels and circulate in the hlood. Manson 
showed in 188 1 that the larvae (Microfilariae) were not at all 
times present in the blood, but that their appearance had a 
certain periodicity, and the larvae of F. bancrojti. Microfilaria 
noctuma swarmed in the blood at night-time and disappeared 
from the peripheral circulation during the day, hiding away in 
the large vessels at the base of the lungs and of the heart. Ten 
years later Manson discovered a second species, Filaria perstans t 
whose larvae live in the blood. They, however, show no period- 
icity, and are found continuously both by day and hy night; 
and their larval forms are termed Microfilaria Persians. The 
adult stages are found in the sub-peritoneal connective tissue. 
A third form, Microfilaria diurna, is found in the larval stage in 
blood, but only in the daytime. The adult stage of this form is 
the Filaria loa found in the subcutaneous tissues of the limbs. 

The presence of these parasites seems at times to have little 
effect on the host, and men in whose system it is calculated 
there are some 40-50 million larvae have shown no signs of 
disease. In other cases very serious disorders of the lymphatic 
system are brought about, of which the most marked is perhaps 
Elephantiasis. Manson and Bancroft suggested that the second 
host of the parasite is the mosquito or gnat, and for a long time it 
was thought that they were conveyed to man by the mosquito 
dying after laying her eggs in water, the larval nematodes 
escaping from her hody and being swallowed by man. It is 
now held that the parasite enters the blood of man through the 
piercing mouth-parts at the time of biting. When first sucked 
up by the insect from an infected man it passes into its stomach, 
and thence makes its way into the thoracic muscles, and there 
for some time it grows. Next the larvae make their way into 
the connective tissue in the pro-thorax, and ultimately bore a 
channel into the base of the piercing apparatus and come to 
rest between the hypopharynx and the labium. Usually two are 
found in this position lying side by side; it would be interesting 
to know if these are male and female. From their position in 
the proboscis the larvae can easily enter the hlood of man the 
next time the mosquito hites (Low, Brit. Med. Journ., June 1900; 
James, ibid., Sept. 1900). Shortly after Low had published his 
results, Grassi and Noe issued a paper dealing with the larvae 
of F. immitis, which is spread by means of the mosquito Anopheles 
(Cenlrbl. Bakter. I. Abth. xxviii., 1900). The larvae of this 
parasite develop in the Malpighian tubules of the insect; at a 
certain stage they cast their cuticle and make their way into 
the space — part of the haemocoel — found in the labium. During 
the act of biting the lahium is bent back, and as the piercing 
stylets enter the skin of the sufferer this bending becomes more 
and more acute. Grassi and Noe think that if the cavity of the 
labium be full of the larval nematodes this hending will burst the 
tissue, and through the rent the larvae will escape and make their 
way into the body of the host. Besides Anopheles, two species 
of Ctdex, C. penicillaris and C. pipiens, are also accused of trans- 
mitting the larvae. A paper hy Noe (Atti Ace. Lincei, ix., 1900) 
seems to prove beyond doubt that the larvae of F. immitis 
are transmitted in the manner indicated. The adult worm is 
chiefly found in the heart of the dog, and usually in the right side, 
which may be so packed with the worms as seriously to interfere 
with the circulation (fig. 5). The females produce thousands 
of larvae, which circulate in the blood, and show a certain 
periodicity in their appearance, heing much more numerous 
in the blood at night than during the day. 

Importance as Fests. — Agriculturists now pay increased 
attention to the nematodes that destroy their crops. A good 
example of a fairly typical case is afforded hy Heterodera schachtii, 
which attacks beetroot and causes great loss to the Continental 
sugar manufacturers. The young larvae, nourished by the yolk

which remains over from the egg and by the remains of the 
mother which they have taken into their alimentary canal, 
make their way through the earth, and ultimately coming across 
the root of a beet, begin to bore into it. This they do by means 
of a spine which can be protruded from the mouth. Once within 
the root, they absorb the cell sap of the parenchyma and begin 
to swell until their body projects from the surface of the root in

begin to appear until the larva has twice cast its skin. After 
this a marked sexual dimorphism sets in. The female, hitherto 
indistinguishable from the male, continues to swell until she 
attains the outlines of a lemon. Doing this she bursts the 
epidermis of the rootlet, and her body projects into the surround- 
ing earth. The male has a different life-history (fig. 7). After 

the second larval 
moult, he passes 
throughapassivestage 
comparable to the 
pupa-stadium of an 
insect, and during this 
stage, which occurs 
inside the root, the 
reproductive organs 
are perfected. The 
male next casts his 
cuticle, and by means 
of his spine bores 
through the tissues of 
the root and escapes 
into the earth. Here 
he seeks a female, 
pairs, and soon after- 
wards dies. The eggs 
of the female give 
rise to embryos with- 
in the body of the 
mother; her other organs undergo a retrogressive change 
and serve as food for the young, until the body-wall only 
of the mother remains as a brown capsule. From this the 
young escape and make their way through the earth to new 
roots. The whole life-history extends over a period of some 
4-5 weeks (fig. 7), so that some 6-7 generations are born during 
the warmer months. If we assume that each female produces

NEMATOMORPHA. This zoological group includes Gordian 
worms which are found swimming in an undulatory manner 
or coiling round water-weeds in ponds and puddles, or knotted 
together in an apparently inextricable coil. They may be several 
inches in length and are no thicker than a piece of whip-cord. 

The male is distinguishable from the female by the presence 
of a fork at the posterior end of the body. The body is covered 
by a cuticle which is sculptured and the various markings are 
of systematic importance: it is secreted by a hypodermis which 
also includes nerve-cells and some gland-cells. In the adult 
aquatic stage the alimentary canal shows signs of degeneration, 
and it seems probable that in this stage Gordian worms take no 
food. The mouth is terminal or subterminal; there is a weak 
sucking pharynx situated behind the brain, and a long intestine 
lying along the medio-ventral body-cavity; it ends in a cloaca 
which receives the vasa deferentia in the male. There is a single 
unsegmented nerve-cord which runs along the ventral middle line 
and enlarges posteriorly into a caudal ganglion and anteriorly 
in a ganglion, the brain, which is not supra-oesophageal. The 
peripheral nervous system is minutely described by T. H. 
Montgomery. There is a median eye on the head.

and only in the middle region of the body are there any body- 
cavities, the space within the body being usually filled up with 
parenchyma. There are four closed spaces of the nature of 
body-cavities, two lateral and a dorso-median and a ventro- 
medial Into the former the ovaries project, though the lumen 
of the lateral body-cavity is quite shut off from the lumina of 
the ovaries or uteri. In the adult male 
the lateral body-cavities are absent. A 
curious duct with lateral branches termed 
the supra-intestinal organ lies above the 
intestine in the female. There are two 
series of ovaries extending through a large 
part of the body and accompanied by two 
uteri; the latter open by two oviducts 
which debouch into an atrium which also 
receives the intestine and a single recep- 
taculum seminis, and is continued back- 
ward as the cloaca; this opens posteriorly. 
The ovaries are epithelial sacs which open 
into the uteri. The paired testes extend 
through the greater part of the body and 
end in two vasa deferentia which unite 
with the intestine to form a cloaca. 
The eggs are laid in the spring as a rule, 
&c.. by permission of Mac- and after about a week they give rise to a

Gordian larva still in it, is then eaten by a carnivorous insect 
or by a fish, and the contained Gordian larva becomes elongate 
and mature in its second host. After a year or more this larva - 
emerges into the water and commences to reproduce. 

The unexpected occurrence of these worms in pools and puddles, 
often in great numbers, has given rise to myths about showers 
of worms. They occasionally make their way into the human 
stomach with the drinking-water and are vomited; but this is a 
case of pseudo-parasitism — they are no true parasite of man. 

There are a considerable number of species divided among the 
four genera: Gordius, Paragordius, Chordodes and Parachordodes ; 
the last, a genus of Camerano's, is looked upon with some doubt by 
Montgomery. A free swimming marine form with longitudinal rows 
of bristles, known as Nectonema A. E. Verrill, may also come here, 
but at present its life-history is unknown. The Nematomorpha 
form an isolated group; at first sight they seem to be connected 
with the Nematoda, but in reality their only common feature is the 
tubular genitalia opening into a cloaca, and it seems at present

impossible to connect them with the Annelida. Until more is known 
it seems wisest to look upon them as an isolated assemblage of 
animals with no near affinities to any of the great phyla.

NEMERTINA, or Nemerteans (Nemertca), a subdivision of 
worms, 1 characterized by the ciliation of the skin, the presence 
of a retractile proboscis, the simple arrangement of the generative 
apparatus, and in certain cases by a peculiar pelagic larval 
stage to which the name " pilidium " has been given. Many of 
them are long thread-shaped or ribbon-shaped animals, more or 
less cylindrical in transverse section. Even the comparatively 
shortest species and genera can always be termed elongate, the 
broadest and shortest of 
all being the parasitic 
Malacobdella and the 
pelagic Pelagonemerles. 
There arc no exterior 
appendages of any kind. 
The colours are often 
very bright and varied. 
Nemertines live in the 
sea, some being common 
amongst the corals and 
algae, others hiding in 
the muddy or sandy 
bottom, and secreting 
gelatinous tubes which 
ensheath the body along 
its whole length. For- 
merly, they were gener- 
ally arranged amongst 
the Platyelminthes as 
a sub-order in the 
order of the Turbel- 
larians, but with the 
advance of our know- 
ledge of these lower 
worms it has been found 
desirable to separate 
them from the Turbel- 
larians and to look upon 
the Nemertina as a 
separate phylum. 

0. Burger classifies 
Nemertines into four 
orders : — 

1. Protonemertini, in 
which there are two layers 
of dermal muscles, ex- 
ternal circular and in- 
ternal longitudinal ; the nervous system lies external to the circular 
muscles ; the mouth lies behind the level of the brain ; the proboscis 
has no stylet; there is no caecum to the intestine. Families, 

CARINELLIDAE, HUBRECHTIIDAE. 

II. Mesonemertini, in which the nervous system has passed into 
the dermal muscles and lies amongst them ; other characters as in 
Protonemertini. Family, Cepualothricidae. 

III. Metanemertini, in which the nervous system lies inside 
the dermal muscles in the parenchyma; the mouth lies in front of 
the level of the brain; the proboscis as a rule bears stylets; the 
intestine nearly always has a caecum. Families, Eunemertidae, 
Ototyphlonemertidae, Prosorhocmidae, Ampiiiporidae, 
Tetrastemmatidae, Nectonemertidae, Pelagonemertidae, 
Malacobdellidae. 

This order represents the Hoplonemertini of Hubrecht. 

IV. Heteronemertini, in which the dermal musculature is in 
three layers, an external longitudinal, a middle circular, an internal 
longitudinal; the nervous system lies between the first and second 
of these layers; the outer layer of longitudinal muscles is a new 
development; there is no intestinal caecum; no stylets on the 
proboscis and the mouth is behind the level of the brain. Families, 

EUPOLIIDAE, LlNEIDAE.

This order represents the Schizonemertini of Hubrecht and the 
family Eupolidae. 

The first three orders, which have a double muscular layer, 
external circular and internal longitudinal, are sometimes grouped 
together as the Dimyaria; the Heteronemertini, in which a third 
coat of longitudinal muscles arises outside the circular layer, are then 
placed in a second branch, the T rimy aria. 

The following families and genera are represented on the British 
coasts: Carinellidae, Cannella; Cephalothricidae, Cephalo- 
thrix, Carinoma; Eunemertidae, Eunemertes; Ototyphlone- 
mertidae, OtotypUonemertes; Amphiporidae, Amphiporus, Dre-

with the mouth into a single exterior opening), there is a terminal 
opening, the rhynchostome (subterminal in Valencinia), at the fore- 
most tip of the body, out of which the proboscis is seen shooting 
backwards and forwards, sometimes with so much force that both its 
interior attachments are severed and it is entirely expelled from the 
body. It then often retains its vitality for a long time, apparently 
crawling as if it were itself a worm, a phenomenon which is at least 
partially explained by the extraordinary development of nervous 
tissue, equally distributed all through the walls of the proboscis, 
and either united into numerous longitudinal nerve-stems (Dre- 
panopjiorus, Amphiporus) or spread out into a uniform and com- 
paratively thick layer (Cerebratulus, sp.). This very effective and 
elaborate innervation, which has been directly traced to the brain, 
whence strong nerves (generally two) enter the proboscis, renders 
it exceedingly probable that the most important functions of the 
proboscis are of a sensiferous, tactile nature. In Nemertines the 
' everted proboscis is retracted in the same way as the t tip of a glove 
finger would be if it were pulled backwards by a thread situated in 
the axis and attached to the tip. The comparison may be carried 
still further. The central thread just alluded to is represented in 
the Nemertean proboscis by that portion which is never everted, 
and the tip of the glove by the boundary between the evertiblc and 
non-evertiblc portion of the proboscis — a boundary which in the 
Metanemertini is marked by the presence of a pointed or serrated 
stylet. v This stylet is thus situated terminally when the proboscis 



P.o. 




has reached its maximum eversion. It adds a decisively aggressive 
character to an organ the original significance of which, as we have 
seen, was tactile. This aggressive character has a different aspect in 
several genera which are destitute of a central stylet, but in which 
the surface that is turned outwards upon 
eversion of the proboscis is largely pro- 
vided with nematocysts, sending the 
urticating rods of different sizes in all 
directions. In others this surface is beoet 
with thick', glandular, adhesive papillae. 

The comparison with the glove-finger 
is in so far insufficient as the greater 
portion of the non-evertible half of the 
proboscis is also hollow and clothed by 
glandular walls. Only at the very hinder- 
most end does it pass into the so-called 
retractor-muscle (fig. 2), which is at- 
tached to the wall of the space, or rhyn- 
chocoel, in which the proboscis moves 
about. This retractor-muscle, indeed, 
serves to pull back with great rapidity 
the extruded proboscis, and is aided 
in its action by the musculature of the 
head. The extrusion itself depends en- Fig. 3.— Anterior portion

Partial extrusion lessening the resist- or rhynchostome. 

ance in this region inevitably follows, Oesophagus and 

and when further contractions of the mouth shown by 

walls of the sheath ensue total ex- dotted lines, 

trusion is the consequence. It is 

worthy of notice that in those Nemertines which make a very free 
use of their proboscis, and in which it is seen to be continually 
protruded and retracted, the walls of the proboscidian sheath are 
enormously muscular. On the other hand, they are much less con- 
siderably or even insignificantly so in the genera that are known 
to make a rather sparing use 
of their proboscis. The rhyn- 
chocoel is formed by a split 
which appears in the meso- 
blast ■ surrounding the epi- 
blastic pit which is the fore- 
runner of the proboscis. It 
does not seem to be coclomic. 

The proboscis, which is thus 
an eminently muscular organ, 
is composed of two or three, 
sometimes powerful, layers of 
muscles — one of longitudinal 
and one or two of circular 
fibres. In the posterior re- 
tractor the longitudinal fibres 
become united into one bun- 
dle, which, as noticed above, is 
inserted in the wall of the 
sheath. At the circular inser- 
tion of the proboscis in front 

of the brain the muscular fibres of a Hoplonemertine. Fig. 
belonging to the anterior ex- tracted; fig. 5 everted, 
tremity of the body and those 

connected with the proboscis are very intimately interwoven, forming 
a strong attachment. The short tube between this circular insertion 
and the rhynchostome is called the rhynchodaeum. 

The proboscis broken off and expelled is generally reproduced, 
the posterior ribbon-like end of this reproduced 
portion again fusing with the walls of the sheath. 
There is reason to suppose that, when a wound is 
inflicted by the central stylet, it is envenomed by 
the fluid secreted in the posterior proboscidian 
region being at the same time expelled. A re- 
servoir, a duct and a muscular bulb in the region 
(fig. 4) where the stylet is attached serve for this 
purpose. The significance of two or more (in armature from 
Drepanophortis very numerous) small sacs con- the proboscis of 
taining so-called " reserve " stylets resembling in Drepanophorus. 
shape that of the central dart is insufficiently known. 

The muscular walls of the rhynchocoel, which by their transverse 
contractions serve to bring about eversion of the proboscis in the way 
above traced, are attached to the musculature of the head just in 
front of the ganglionic commissures (fig. 3). In nearly all Nemertines 
the rhynchocoelextends backwards as far as the posterior extremity, 
just above the anus; in Carinella it is limited to the anterior body- 
region. The corpuscles floating in the fluid it contains are of definite

shape, and in Cerebratulus urticans they are deep red, possibly from 
the presence of haemoglobin. They are usually larger than the blood 
corpuscles. Internally the muscular layers are lined by an epi- 
thelium. In the posterior portion this epithelium in certain Hetero- 
nemertea has a more glandular appearance, and sometimes the 
interior cavity is obliterated by cell-proliferation in this region. 
Superiorly the. sheath either closely adheres to the muscular body- 
wall, with which it may even be partly interwoven, or it hangs 
freely in the connective tissue which fills the space between the 
intestine and the muscular body-wall. 

Cutaneous System, — Externally in all species a layer of ciliated 
cells forms the outer investment. In it are, moreover, enclosed 
unicellular glands pouring their highly refracting contents, of a more 
or less rod-like shape, directly to the exterior. They appear to 
be the principal source of the mucus these animals secrete. In most 
Hetcronemertines these elements are separated by a thin homo- 
geneous basement membrane (fig. 8) from the following — that is, 
from a layer in which longitudinal muscular fibres are largely inter- 
mixed with tortuous glands, which by reason of their deeper situation 
communicate with the exterior by a much longer and generally very 
narrow duct. The pigment is also principally localized in this layer, 
although sometimes it is present even deeper down within the 
musculature. The passage from this tegumentary layer to the 
subjacent longitudinal muscular one is gradual, no membrane 
separating them. In Carinella, Cephalotkrix, Polia and the Metane- 
mertines the two tegumentary layers with their different glandular 
elements are fused into one; a thick layer of connective tissue 
is situated beneath them (instead of between them) and keeps the 
entire cutaneous system more definitely separate from the muscular 
(figs. 7, 8). 

Musculature and Connective Tissue. — The muscular layers by which 
the body-wall is constituted have been very differently and to some 
extent confusingly described by the successive authors on Nemertean 
anatomy. There is sufficient reason for this confusion. The fact 
is that not only have the larger subdivisions a different arrangement 
and even number of the muscular layers, but even within the same 
genus, nay, in the same species, well-marked differences occur.

Increase in size appears sometimes to be accompanied by the develop- 
ment ol a new layer of fibres, whereas a difference in the method of 
preparation may give to a layer which appeared homogeneous in 
one specimen a decidedly fibrous aspect in another. Nevertheless 
there are three principal types under which the different modifications 
can be arranged. One of them is found in the two most primitively 
organized genera, Carinella and Cephalotkrix, i.e. an outer circular, a 
longitudinal ^nd an inner circular layer of muscular fibres (fig. 7). 
The second is common to all the Heteronemertines, as well as to Polia 
and Valencinia, and also comprehends three layers, of which, how- 
ever, two are longitudinal, viz. the external and the internal one, 
there being a strong circular layer between them (fig. 9;. To the 
third type all the Metanemertint correspond; their muscular layers 
are only two. an external circular and an internal longitudinal one 
(fig. 8). 

The Heteronemertini thus appear to have developed an extra layer 
of longitudinal fibres internally to those which they inherited from 
more primitive ancestors, whereas the Metanemertini are no longer 
in possession of the internal circular layer, but have on the contrary 
largely developed the external circular one, which has dwindled 
away in the Heteronemertini. The situation of the lateral nerve- 
stems in the different genera with respect to the muscular layers 
lends definite support to the interpretation of their homologies here 
given and forms the basis of Burger's classification. 

In Carinella, Cephalotkrix and Polia, as well as in all Metane- 
mertines, the basement membrane of the skin already alluded 
to is particularly strong and immediately applied upon the muscular 
layers. In the Heteronemertines there is a layer in which the 
cutaneous elements are largely represented below the thin basement 
membrane (fig. 8), between it and the bulk of the outer longitudinal 
muscles. The difference in the appearance of the basement mem- 
brane — sometimes wholly homogeneous, sometimes eminently 
fibrillar — can more especially be observed in differently preserved 
specimens of the genus Polia.

The connective tissue of the integument and basement membrane 
imperceptibly merges into that which surrounds the muscular 
bundles as they are united into denser and definite layers, and this is 
especially marked in those forms (Akrostomum) where the density of 
the muscular body-wall has considerably diminished, and the con- 
nective tissue has thus become much more prominent. It can then at 
the same time be observed, too, that the compact mass of connective 
tissue (" reticulum," Barrois) which lies between the muscular body- 
wall and the intestine is directly continuous with that in which the 
muscular layers are embedded. Nuclei are everywhere present. The 
omnipresence of this connective tissue tends to exclude the formation 
of any perivisceral body cavity in Nemcrtincs. 

In Polia the connective tissue enclosed in the external muscular 
layer is eminently vacuolar — all the intermediate stages between 
such cells in which the vacuole predominates and the nucleus is 
peripheral and those in which the granular protoplasm still entirely 
fills them being moreover present. 

In addition to the musculature of the proboscis and proboscidian 
sheath, longitudinal muscular fibres are found in the walls of the 
oesophagus, whilst transverse ones are numerous and united into 
vertical dissepiments between the successive intestinal caeca, thus 
bringing about a very regular internal metamerization. The genital 
products develop in intermediate spaces similarly limited by these 
dissepiments and alternating with the digestive caeca. 

Nervous System and Sense Organs. — The nervous system of Nemer- 
tines presents several interesting peculiarities. As central organs 
we have to note the brain-lobes 
and the longitudinal lateral cords 
which form one continuous unscg- 
mented massol fibrous and cellular 
nerve-tissue. The fibrous nerve- 
tissue is more dense in the higher 
differentiated, more loose and 
spongy in the lower organized 
forms; the cellular nerve-tissue is 
similarly less compact in the forms 
that are at the base of the scale. 

No ganglionic swellings whatever tine (fig. 10) and a Hoplo-

tudinal cords. The brain must be opening; u.l, superior brain- 
looked upon as the anterior thick- lobe; p.l. t posterior brain-lobe, 
ening of these cords, and at the same 

time as the spot where the two halves of the central nerve system 
intercommunicate. This is brought about by a double commissure, 
of which the ventral portion is considerably thicker than the dorsal, 
and which, together with the brain-lobes, constitutes a ring through 
which both proboscis and proboscidian sheath pass. The brain-lobes 
are generally four in number, a ventral and a dorsal pair, respectively 
united together by the above-mentioned commissures, and moreover 
anteriorly interfusing with each other, right and left. In Carinella 
this separation into lobes of the anterior thickenings of the cords has 
not yet commenced, the ventral commissure at the same time being 
extremely bulky. There is great probability that the central stems, 
together with the brain, must be looked upon as local longitudinal 
accumulations of ner- sr-z?^ ^ s^"*^

Clexus, situated in the 
ody-wall in a similar 
way to that which still 
is found in the less 
highly organized Coelcn- 
terates. Such a nervous 
plexus indeed occurs 
in the body-wall of all 
Heteronemer tines, 
sometimes even as a 
comparatively thick 
layer, situated, as arc 
the nerve stems, be- 
tween the external 
longitudinal and the 
circular muscles (fig. 
9). In Carinella, where 

the longitudinal nerve-stems are situated exteriorly to the 
cular layers, this plexus, although present, is much less dense, 
and can more fitly be compared to a network with wide meshes. 
In both eases it can be shown to be in immediate continuity with the 
coating of nerve-cells forming part of the longitudinal cords. It 
stretches forward as far as the brain, and in Carinella is again con- 
tinued in front of it, whereas in the Heteronemertines the innervation 
of the anterior extremity of the head, in front of the brain, takes the 
form of more definite and less numerous branching stems. The 
presence of this plexus in connexion with the central stems, sending 
out nervous filaments amongst the muscles, explains the absence, in 
Pro-, Meso- and Hetcronemertines, of separate and distinct peri- 
pheral nerve stems springing from the central stems innervating 
the different organs and body-regions, the only exceptions being the

nerves for the proboscis, those for the sense organs in the head and 
the strong nerve pair (tt. vagus) for the oesophagus. At the same 
time it renders more intelligible the extreme sensitiveness of the body- 
wall of the Nemertines, a local and instantaneous irritation often 
resulting in spasmodic rupture of the animal at the point touched. 

In the Metanemertini, where the longitudinal stems lie inside the 
muscular body-wall, definite and metamerically placed nerve 
branches spring from them and divide dichotomously in the different 
tissues they innervate. A definite plexus can here no longer be 
traced. In certain Metanemertines the lateral stems have been 
noticed to unite posteriorly by a terminal commissure, situated 
above the anus, the whole of the central nervous system being in 
this way virtually situated above the intestine. In others there is an 
approximation of the lateral stems towards the median ventral line 
(Drepanophorus) ; in a genus of Heteronemertines (Langia), on the 
other hand, an arrangement occurs by which the longitudinal stems 
are no longer lateral, but have more or less approached each other 
dorsally. 

In addition to the nerves starting from the brain-lobes just now 
especially mentioned, there is a double apparatus which can hardly 
be treated of in conjunction with the sense organs, because its 
sensory functions have not been sufficiently made out, and which 
will therefore rather be considered along with the brain and central 
nervous system. This apparatus is usually known under the name 
of the lateral organs. To it belong (a) superficial grooves or deeper 
slits situated on the integument near the tip of the head, (6) nerve 
lobes in immediate connexion with the nervous tissue of the brain, 
and (c) ciliated ducts penetrating into the latter and communicating 
with the former. Embryology shows that originally these different 
parts arc separately started, and only ultimately become united 
into one. Two lateral outgrowths of the foremost portion of the 
oesophagus, afterwards becoming constricted off, as well as two 
ingrowths from the epiblast, contribute towards its formation, at 
least as far as both Mcta- and Heteronemertines are concerned. As 
to the Mesonemertini, in the most primitive genus, Carinella, we do 
not find any lateral organs answering to the description above given. 
What we do find is a slight transverse furrow on each side of the hc-ad, 
close to the tip, but the most careful examination of sections made 
• through the tissues of the head and brain shows the absence of any 
further apparatus comparable to that described above. Only in one 
species, tarinella inexpectata, a step in advance has been made, in 
so far as in connexion with the furrow just mentioned, which is 
here also somewhat more complicated in its arrangement, a ciliated 
tube leads into the brain, there to end blindly amidst the nerve- 
cells. No other intermediate stages have as yet been noticed 
between this arrangement and that of the Heteronemertini, in which 
a separate posterior brain-lobe receives a similar ciliated canal, and 
in Which the oesophageal outgrowths have made their appearance 
and are coalesced with the nerve-tissue in the organ of the adult 
animal. The histological elements of this portion remain distinct 
. both by transmitted light and in actual sections. 

These posterior brain-lobes, which in all Heteronemertines are in 
direct continuity of tissue with the upper pair of principal lobes, 
cease to have this intimate connexion in the Metanemertini; and, 
although still constituted of (i) a ciliated duct, opening out exter- 
nally, (2) nervous tissue surrounding it, and (3) histological elements 
distinctly different from the nervous, and most probably directly 
derived from the oesophageal outgrowths, they are nevertheless 
here no longer constantly situated behind the upper brain-lobes and 
directly connected with them, but are found sometimes behind, 
sometimes beside and sometimes before the brain-lobes. Further- 
more, they are here severed from the principal lobes and connected 
with them by one or more rather thick strings of nerve-fibres. 
In some cases, especially when the lobes lie before the brain, their 
distance from it, as well as the length of these nervous connexions, 
has considerably increased. 

These curious neuro-glandular pits (fig. 1), absent in* the Mesone- 
mertine and one or two aberrant species, have been shown to possess 
large glandular cells at their base which secrete a mucus. The 
development of these organs, which in the Protonemertine are but 
grooves in the epidermis, not far removed from the similar cephalic 
slits of many Turbellaria, reaches its height in Drepanophorus. Here 
the pits split into two, one part ending in a sac lined with sensory 
epithelium, and embedded in nervous tissue, the other projecting 
backwards as a long, glandular, blind canal. The exit of these organs 
takes many shapes, of value in systematic work. Their function is 
still little understood. Two lateral, shallow pits occur on the side 
of the body about the level of the hinder end of the proboscis in 
some species of the genus Carinella, which are termed side-organs. 
Thesie are capable of being everted, and are probably sensory in 
function (fig. 20, if). 

For the Heteronemertines arguments have been adduced to prove 
that here they have the physiological significance of a special respir- 
atory apparatus for the central nervous tissue, which in all these 
forms is strongly charged with haemoglobin. The haemoglobin 
would, by its pre-eminent properties of fixing oxygen, serve to 
furnish the nerve system, which more than any other requires a 
constant supply, with the necessary oxygen. Such could hardly 
be obtained in any other way by those worms that have no special 
respiratory apparatus, and that live in mud and under stones where 



the natural supply of freshly oxygenated sea-water is practically 
limited. Whether in the Metanemertines, where the blood fluid is

often provided with haemoglobiniferous disks, the chief functions 
of the^ side organs may not rather be a sensory one needs further 
investigation. 

The exterior opening of the duct has been several times alluded to. 
In the Metanemertines it is generally situated towa/ds the middle- 
of a lateral transverse groove on either side s~** 
of the head, as was noticed for Carinella, and fk ^ 
as is also present in Polia. Generally a 
row of shorter grooves perpendicular to the 
first, and similarly provided with strong 
cilia, enlarges the surface of these furrows 
(fig. 14). In Valencinia there is nothing but 
a circular opening without furrow. In 'all 
Heteronemertines there is on each side of Fig. 13. 
the head a longitudinal slit of varying length p IGS 
but generally considerable depth, in the ^^ v — s of head

ciliated. In life they are commonly rhythmi- with transverse groove 
cally opened and shut by a way move- and furrows> 
ment. They are the head slits (cephalic 

fissures, " Kopfspalten ") so characteristic of this subdivision 
(figs. 10 and 13). 

With respect to the sense organs of the Nemertines, we find that 
eyes are of rather constant occurrence, although many Hetero- 
nemertines living in the mud appear to be blind. The more highly 
organized species have often very numerous eyes (Amphiporus, 
Drepanophorus), which are provided with a spherical refracting 
anterior portion, with a cellular " vitreous body," with a layer of 
delicate radially arranged rods, with an outer sheath of dark pigment, 
and with a separate nerve-twig each, springing from a common or 
double pair of branches v/hich leave the brain as n. optici, for the 
innervation of the eyes. Besides these more highly differentiated 
organs of vision, more primitive eyes are present in others down to 
simple stellate pigment specks without any refracting apparatus. 

Organs of hearing in the form of capsules containing otoliths 
have only been very rarely observed, apparently only in Metane- 
mertini. 

As to the organ of touch, the great sensitiveness of the body has 
already been noticed, as well as the probable primary significance 
of the proboscis. Small tufts of tactile hairs or papillae are sometimes 
observed in small number at the tip of the head; sometimes longer 
hairs, apparently rather stiff, are seen on the surface, very sparingly 
distributed between the cilia, and hitherto only in a very limited 
number of small specimens. They may perhaps be considered as 
sensory. 

Digestive System. — The anterior opening, the mouth, is situated 
ventrally, close to the tip of the head and in front of the brain in the 
Metanemertini , somewhat more backward and behind the brain in 
the other Nemertines. In most Heteronemertines it is found to be 
an elongated slit with corrugated borders; in the Metanemertines 
it is smaller and rounded; in Malacobdella and Akrostomum it, 
moreover, serves for the extrusion of the proboscis, which emerges 
by a separate dorsal opening just inside the mouth. The oesophagus 
is the anterior portion of the digestive' canal; its walls are folded 
longitudinally, comparatively thick and provided with longitudinal 
muscular fibres. Two layers are specially obvious in its walls— the 
inner layer bordering the lumen being composed of smaller ciliated 
cells, the outer thicker one containing numerous granular cells and 
having a more glandular character. Outside the walJL of the oeso- 
phagus a vascular space has been detected which is in direct con- 
tinuity with the longitudinal blood-vessels. In certain cases, how- 
ever, the walls of the oesophagus appear to be very closely applied 
to the muscular body- wall and this vascular space thereby con- 
siderably reduced. 

The posterior portion of the intestine is specially characterized 
by the appearance of the intestinal diverticula horizontally and 
symmetrically placed right and left and opposite to each other. 

In the Metanemertini there is a curious diverticulum of the intes- 
tine which stretches forward in the median line, ventral to the so- 
called stomach. It is at times sacculated, but its chief interest is that, 
as Lebedinsky 1 has shown, the tip of the caecum in embryonic life 
opens to the exterior as the blastopore. This subsequently closes up, 
and the newly-formed oesophagus and stomach open in the intestine 
above and behind it. It is a curious feature in Nemertines that the 
alimentary canal seldom contains traces of food and yet most of these 
worms are voracious. The food must be digested, absorbed and ex- 
creted with great rapidity. There is some evidence that in this 
group the ectoderm of the oesophagus is chiefly concerned with 
digestion, whereas the endoderm of the intestine is limited to the 
absorption of the soluble products. 

Cases of asymmetry or irregularity in the arrangement of the 
intestinal caeca, though sometimes occurring, are not normal. At 
the tip of the tail, where the growth o f the animal takes place, the

caeca are always eminently regular. So they are throughout the 
whole body in most of the Metanemertines. In Carinella they are 
generally deficient and the intestine straight; in young specimens 
of this species, however, they occur, though less regular and more in 
the form of incipient foldings by which the digestive surface is, 
increased. The inner surface of the intestinal caeca is ciliated, the 
o „ s caeca themselves are some- 

jt" \ / times — especially in the 

Cj, X^^^^^^B^L GX hindermost portion of the 

body — of a considerably 
smaller lumen than the in- 
termediate genital spaces; 
sometimes, however, the 
reverse is the case, and in 
both cases it is the smaller 
lumen that appears enclosed 
between and suspended by 
the transverse fibres con- 
stituting the muscular dis- 
sepiments above mentioned. 
The anus is situated ter- 
minally, the muscular body- 
wall through which the 
intestine must find its way 
outwards probably acting 
in this region the part of a 
sphincter. The lateral nerve 
stems mostly terminate on 
both sides in closest prox- 
imity to the anus; in cer- 
tain species, however, they 
interfuse by a transverse 
connexion above the anus. 
The longitudinal blood- 
vessels do the same. 

Circulatory Apparatus. — 
The chief vessels are three 
longitudinal trunks, a 
median and two lateral ones. 
They are in direct con- 
nexion with each other both 
at the posterior and at the 
anterior end of the body. 
At the posterior end they 
communicate together by a 
T-shaped connexion in a 
simple and uniform way. 
Anteriorly there is a cer- 
tain amount of difference 
in the arrangement. Where- 
as in the Metanemertines an 
arrangement prevails as re-

lateral stems, while entirely 
uniform all through the 

Costerior portion of the 
ody, no longer individually 
exist in the oesophageal 
region, but here dissolve 
themselves into a network 
of vascular spaces surround- 
ing this portion of the di- 
gestive tract. The median 
dorsal vessel, however, re- 
mains distinct, but instead 
of continuing its course be- 
neath the proboscidian 
sheath it is first enclosed by 
the ventral musculature of 
this organ, and still farther 
forwards it even bulges out 
longitudinally 



, into the 
cavity of the sheath. Anteriorly it finally communicates with the 
lacunae just mentioned, which surround the oesophagus, bathe the 
posterior lobes of the brain, pass through the nerve ring together 
with the proboscidian sheath, and are generally continued in front 
of the brain as a lacunar space in the muscular tissue, one on each 
side. 

Special mention must be made of the delicate transverse vessels 
regularly connecting the longitudinal and the lateral ones. They 
are metamerically placed, and belong to the same metamere as the 
digestive caeca, thus alternating with the generative sacs. The 
blood fluid does not flow in any definite direction ; its movements 
are largely influenced by those of the muscular body-wall. It is 
colourless and^ contains definite corpuscles, which are round or 
elliptical, and in many Metanemertines are coloured red by haemo- 
globin, being colourless in other species. The circulatory system 
of Carinella is considerably different, being more lacunar and less 
restricted to definite vascular channels. Two lateral longitudinal 




lacunae form, so to say, the forerunners of the lateral vessels. A 
median longitudinal vessel and transverse connecting trunks have 
not as yet been detected. There are large lacunae in the head in 
front of the ganglia. 

The vascular system is entirely closed. It contains a colourless 
fluid, with flat, oval nucleated corpuscles, as a rule colourless, but in 
some cases tinged with yellow or red haemo- 
globin. Its presence is one of the most dis- 
tinctive features which separate the Nemer- 
tines from the Platyhelminthes. In origin 
the vascular system is due to a fusion of 
spaces which arise in the mesoblast of the 
larva. The blood is probably circulated by 
the general contraction of the whole animal, 
since it is very doubtful if there are any 
intrinsic muscles in the vessel- walls. Its 
function is less that of respiration than of p IG x g Diagram

.developed genera seem to be partly lacunae and partly true vessels 

with definite walls. 

Nephridia. — Associated with the lateral blood-vessels are the single 
pair of nephridia. Each consists of a more or less coiled, ciliated, 
longitudinal canal, which on its external surface gives origin to one 
or more transverse canals, which pass to the exterior and open a 
little way behind the mouth on the sides of the body. On its inner 
surface the longitudinal canal is adpressed to the lateral blood- 
vessel, and gives off a number of small, blind caeca or tags, each of 
which ends in a small clump of cells. These tags indent the blood- 
vessel. From their inner ends, projecting into the lumen of the tag, 
hangs a bunch of cilia, which forms the flickering " flame " so well 
known in the excretory apparatus of the Platyhelminthes and larval 
Annelids (fig. 19). There is no communication between the nephridia 
on one side and the other, but in Eupolia there are ducts opening 
into the alimentary canal as well as to 
the exterior, a condition of things which 
recalls what obtains in certain Oligochaetes. 
As a rule these organs only extend a short 
way along the anterior end of the body, 
a concentration which we may associate 
with the development of a vascular system 
to bring the products of excretion to a 
fixed spot. In Stichostemma, however, 
Montgomery l has described a series of 
nephridia lying all along the body, 
a nd each wi t h a varying nu mber of 
external pores. The excretory system is 
epiblastic in its origin. 

The two external openings of the 
nephridia are situated sometimes more 
towards the ventral, at other times more 
towards the dorsal side. Even in the 
larger Heteronemertines these pores are 
only a few millimetres behind the mouth 
region. In transverse sections the nephridia 
can be shown to be generally situated in 
the region limited by (1) the proboscidian 
sheath, (2) the upper wall of the intestine, 
(3) the muscular body-wall. No trace of 
nephridia is found posterior to the oeso- 
phagus. 

Generative System. — In the Nemertines 
the sexes are separate, with only very 

few exceptions (Tetrastemma hcrma- excretory system lying 
phroditica t Marion). The reproductive on the lateral vessel of 
system is of the simplest, strongly con- Drepanophorus specta- 
trasting with the complicated arrange- bilis. (Magnified about

of sacs lined with an epithelium, the pro- excretory canal ; 2, one 
liferation of which gives rise to the ova of the tags containing the 
or spermatozoa, alternate between the flame-cells, 
caeca of the intestine. When mature, 

each sac pushes out a process to the exterior, and this forms 
the genital duct. The line of the genital openings is usually 
dorsal to the lateral nerve. The whole sac, with its epithelial 
wall and its contained genital cells, arises ultimately from some 
of the parenchymatous cells of the body. The walls and con- 
tents in some forms arise simultaneously; in others the walls are 
first formed and their lining then proliferates. It has been pointed 
out that the cavity of the sacs corresponds^ many particulars with 
the coelom of higher animals, and in Lebidinsky's observations on 
the development there is some support to the view that a coelom 
exists. Montgomery has also described certain spaces which may 
be coelomic lying between the alimentary canal and the inner 
longitudinal layer of muscles in the Heteronemertini. The ova and

spermatozoa, when mature, present no peculiarities. As the ova are 
in many species deposited in a gelatinous tube secreted by the body- 
walls, in which they are arranged (three or more together) in flask- 
shaped cavities, impregnation must probably take place either before 
or at the very moment of their being deposited. The exact mode has

statement that to a certain extent the Nemertines represent Turbel-

Development. — The embryology of the Nemertines offers some 
very remarkable peculiarities. Our knowledge of the development 
of the most primitive forms is scanty. Both Iletero- and Metane- 
mertini have been more exhaustively studied than the other two 
groups, the first, as was noticed above, being characterized by peculiar 
larval forms, the second developing without metamorphosis. 

The larva of Ccrebratidus is called the pilidium. In exterior shape 
it resembles a helmet with spike and ear-lobes, the spike being a 
strong and long flagellum or a tuft of long cilia, the ear-lobes lateral 
ciliated appendages (fig. 21). It encloses the primitive alimentary 

tract. Two pairs of invaginations of 
the skin, which originally are called 
the prostomial and metastomial disks, 
grow round the intestine, finally fuse 
together, and form the skin and mus- 
cular body-wall of the future Nemer- 
tine, which afterwards becomes cili- 
ated, frees itself from the pilidium in- 
vestment and develops into the adult 
worm without further metamorphosis. 
The eggs of these species are not 
enveloped by such massive gelatinous 
strings as are those of the genus 
Linens, In the latter we find the 
young Nemertines crawling about 
after a period of from six to eight 
weeks, and probably feeding upon a 
portion of this gelatinous substance, 
which is found to diminish in bulk. 
In accordance with these more seden- 
tary habits during the first phases of 
life, the characteristic pilidium larva, 
which is so eminently adapted for a

po.d. s Metastomial disk. Nemertine has similarly originated 

out of four ingrowths from the 
primary epiblast. To this reduced and sedentary pilidium the 
name of " larva of Desor " has been given. 

In the Metanemertini, as far as they have been investigated, a 
direct development without metamorphosis has been observed. 
It appears probable that this is only a further simplification of the 
more complicated metamorphosis described above. 

As to the development of the different organs, there is still much 
that remains doubtful. The hypoblast in some forms originates by 
invagination, in others by delamination. The proboscis is an in- 
vagination from the epiblast; the proboscidian sheath appears in 
the mesoblast, but is perhaps originally derived from the hypoblast. 
The origin of the lateral organs has already been noticed ; that of the 
nerve system is essentially epiblastic. 

Affinities.— The position of the Nemertines in the animal king- 
dom is now looked upon as more isolated than was formerly thought, 
and recent writers have been inclined to treat them as a separate 
phylum. Whether this view be adopted or not, and whether the 
Turbellaria be regarded as nearly related or only remotely connected, 
there can be little doubt that the Nemertines resemble the Turbel- 
laria more nearly than they do any other group of animals. Burger 
even goes so far as to homologize the proboscis with the Turbellarian

NEMESIANUS, MARCUS AURELIUS OLYMPIUS, Roman 
poet, a native of Carthage, flourished about a.d. 283. He was 
a popular poet at the court of the Roman emperor Cams 
(Vopiscus, Carus, 11). He wrote poems on the arts of fishing 
(Halieiitica), aquatics (Nautica) and hunting (Cynegetica) , but 
only a fragment of the last, 325 hexameter lines, has been 
preserved. It is neatly expressed in good Latin, and was used 
as a school text-book in the 9th century. Four eclogues, formerly 
attributed to Titus Calpurnius (q.v.) Siculus, are now generally 
considered to be by Nemesianus, and the Praise of Hercules t 
generally printed in Claudian's works, may be by him.

NEMESIS, the personification of divine justice. This is the 
only sense in which the word is used in Homer, while Hesiod 
(Theog. 223) makes Nemesis a goddess, the daughter of Night 
(some, however, regard the passage as an interpolation); she 
appears in a still more concrete form in a fragment of the Cypria. 
The word Nemesis originally meant the distributor (Gr. vkixav) 
of fortune, whether good or bad, in due proportion to each man 
according to his deserts; then, the resentment caused by any 
disturbance of this proportion, the sense of justice that could 
not allow it to pass unpunished. Gruppe and others prefer to 
connect the name with vefieeav, vcfie<ri£e<rQai ("to feel just 
resentment")- In J:he tragedians Nemesis appears chiefly as 
the avenger of crime and the punisher of arrogance, and as such 
is akin to Ate and the Erinyes. She was sometimes called 
Adrastcia, probably meaning " one from whom there is no 
escape "; the epithet is specially applied to the Phrygian 
Cybele, with wham, as with Aphrodite and Artemis, her cult 
shows certain affinities. She was specially honoured in the 
district of Rhamnus in Attica, where she was perhaps originally 
an ancient Artemis, partly confused with Aphrodite. A festival 
called Nemeseia (by some identified with the Genesia) was held 
at Athens. Its object was to avert the nemesis of the dead, 
who were supposed to have the power of punishing the living, 
if their cult had been in any way neglected (Sophocles, Electra, 
792; E. Rohde, Psyche, 1907, i. 236, note 1). At Smyrna 
there were two divinities of the name, more akin to Aphrodite 
than to Artemis. The reason for this duality is hard to explain; 
it is suggested that they represent two aspects of the goddess, the 
kindly and the malignant, or the goddesses of the old and the 
new city. Nemesis was also worshipped at Rome by victorious 
generals, and in imperial times was the patroness of gladiators 
and venalores (fighters with wild beasts) in the arena and one of 
the tutelary deities of the drilling-ground {Nemesis campestris). 
In the 3rd century a.d. there is evidence of the belief in an all- 
powerful Nemesis-Fortuna. She was worshipped by a society 
called Nemcsiaci. In early times the representations of Nemesis 
resembled Aphrodite, who herself sometimes bears the epithet 
Nemesis. Later, as the goddess of proportion and the avenger 
of crime, she has as attributes a measuring rod, a bridle, a sword 
and a scourge, and rides in a chariot drawn by griffins.

NEMESIUS (fl. c. a.d. 390), a Christian philosopher, author 
of a treatise 7repi <f>v<xecos avOpdnrov (On Human Nature), was, 
according to the title of his book, bishop of Emesa (in Syria); 
of his life nothing further is known, and even his date is uncertain, 
but internal evidence points to a date after the Apollinarian 
controversy and before the strife connected with the names of 
Eutyches and Nestorius, i.e. about the end of the 4th century. 
His book is an interesting attempt to compile a system of anthro- 
pology from the standpoint of the Christian philosophy. Moses 
and Paul are put side hy side with Aristotle and Menander, 
and there is a clear inclination to Platonic doctrines of pre- 
existence and metempsychosis. In physiological matters he 
is in advance of Aristotle and Galen, though we can hardly 
assert — as has sometimes been thought — that he anticipated 
Harvey's discovery of the circulation of the blood. The treatise 
is conclusive evidence as to the mutual influence of Christianity 
and Hellenism in the 4th century. John of Damascus and the 
schoolmen, including Albertus Magnus and Thomas Aquinas, 



held Nemesius in high esteem, believing his book to be the work 
of Gregory of Nyssa, with whom he has much in common.

NEMORENSIS LACUS (mod. Nemz), a lake in the Alban 
Hills, in an extinct subsidiary crater in the outer ring of the 
ancient Alban crater, E. of the Lake of Albano. It is about 
3 J m. in diameter and some no ft. deep; the precipitous slopes 
of its basin are over 300 ft. high, and on the side towards the 
modern village a good deal more, and are mainly cultivated. 
It is now remarkable for its picturesque beauty. In ancient times 
it was included in the territory of Aricia, and bore the name 
" Mirror of Diana." The worship of Diana here was a very 
ancient one, and, as among the Scythians, was originally, so it 
was said, celebrated with human sacrifices; even in imperial 
times the priest of Diana was a man of low condition, a gladiator 
or a fugitive slave, who won his position by slaying bis pre- 
decessor in fight, having first plucked a mistletoe bough from 
the sacred grove, and who, notwithstanding, bore the title of 
rex (king). It is curious that in none of the inscriptions that have 
been found is the priest of Diana mentioned; and it has indeed 
been believed by Morpurgo and Frazer that the rex was not the 
priest of Diana at all, but, according to the former, the priest 
of Virbius, or, according to the latter, the incarnation of the 
spirit of the forest. The temple itself was one of the most splendid 
in Latium; Octavian borrowed money from it in 31 B.C., and 
it is frequently mentioned by ancient writers. Its remains are 
situated a little above the level of the lake, and to the N.E. of 
it. They consist cf a large platform, the back of which is formed 
by a wall of concrete faced with opus reticulatum, with niches, 
resting against the cliffs which form the sides of the crater. 
Excavations in the 17th and the last quarter of the 19th centuries 
(now covered in again), and also in 1905, led to the discovery 
of the temple itself, a rectangular edifice, 98 by 52 ft., and of 
various inscriptions, a rich frieze in gilt bronze, many statuettes 
(ex-votos) from the favissae of the temple in terra-cot ta and 
bronze, a large number of coins, &c. None of the objects seem 
to go back beyond the 4th century B.C. A road descended to 
it from the Via Appia from the S.W., passing through the modern 
village of Genzano. The lake is drained by a tunnel of about 
2 m. long of Roman date. On the W* side of the lake remains 
of two ships (really floating palaces moored to the shore) have been 
found, one belonging to the time of Caligula (as is indicated by 
an inscription on a lead pipe), and measuring 210 ft. long by 
66 wide, the other even larger, 233 by 80 ft. The first was 
decorated with marbles and mosaics, and with some very fine 
bronze beamheads, with heads of wolves and lions having rings 
for hawsers in their mouths (and one of a Medusa), now in the 
Museo delle Terme at Rome, with remains of the woodwork, 
&c, &c. Various attempts have been made to raise the first 
ship, from the middle of the 15th century onwards, by which 
much harm has been done. The neighbourhood of the lake was 
naturally in favour with the Romans as a residence. Caesar 
had a villa constructed there, but destroyed again almost at 
once, because it did not satisfy him.

NEMOURS, LORDS AND DUKES OF. In the 12th and 13th 
centuries the lordship of Nemours, in Gatinais, France, was in 
possession of the house of Villebeon, a member of which, Gautier, 
was marshal of France in the middle of the 13th century. The 
lordship was sold to King Philip III. in 1274 and 1276 by Jean 
and Philippe de Nemours, and was then made .a county and 
given to Jean de Grailly, captal de Buch in 1364. In 1404 
Charles VI. of France gave it to Charles III. of Evreux, king of 
Navarre, and erected it into a duchy in the peerage of France 
(ducU-pairie). Charles III.'s daughter, Beatrix, brought the

NEMOURS, DUC DE 



duchy to her husband Jacques de Bourbon, count of La Marche, 
and by the marriage of their daughter, Eleanor, to Bernard of 
Armagnac, count of Pardiac, it passed to the house of Armagnac. 
After being confiscated and restored several times, the duchy 
reverted to the French crown in 1505, after the extinction of the 
house of Armagnac-Pardiac. In 1 507 it was given by Louis XII. 
to his nephew, Gaston de Foix, who was killed at Ravenna in 
1512. The duchy then returned to the royal domain, and was 
detached from it successively for Giuliano de Medici and his 
wife Philiberta of Savoy in 15^, for Louise of Savoy in 1524, and 
for Philip of Savoy, count of Genevois, in 1528. The descend- 
ants of the last-mentioned duke possessed the duchy until its 
sale to Louis XIV. In 1572 Louis gave it to his brother Philip, 
duke of Orleans, whose descendants possessed it until the 
Revolution. The title of due de Nemours was afterwards given 
to Louis Charles, son of King Louis Philippe, who is dealt with 
separately below. 

The following are the most noteworthy of the earlier dukes 
of Nemours. 

James of Armagnac, duke of Nemours (c. 1433-147 7), was 
the son of Bernard d'Armagnac, count of Pardiac, and Eleanor of 
Bourbon-La Marche. As comte de Castres, he served under 
Charles VII. in Normandy in 1449 and 1450 ; and afterwards in 
Guienne. On the accession of Louis XI. the king loaded him 
with honours, married him to his god-daughter, Louise of Anjou, 
and recognized his title to the duchy of Nemours in 1462. Sent 
by Louis to pacify Roussillon, Nemours f :lt that he had been 
insufficiently rewarded for the rapid success of this expedition, 
and joined the League of the Public Weal in 1465. He subse- 
quently became reconciled with Louis, but soon resumed his 
intrigues. After twice pardoning him, the king's patience 
became exhausted, and he besieged the duke's chateau at Carlat 
and took him prisoner. Nemours was treated with the utmost 
rigour, being shut up in a cage ; and was finally condemned to 
death by the parlemcnt and beheaded on the 4th of August 1477. 

See B. de Mandrot, Jacques d' Armagnac^ due de Nemours (Paris, 
1890). 

Philip of Savoy, duke of Nemours (1490-1533), was a son 
of Philip, duke of Savoy, and brother of Louise of Savoy, mother 
of Francis I. of France. Originally destined for the priesthood, 
he was given the bishopric of Geneva at the age of five, but 
resigned it in 15 10, when he was made count of Genevois. He 
served under Louis XII., with whom he was present at the battle 
of Agnadello (1509), under the emperor Charles V. in 1520, and 
finally under his nephew, Francis I, In 1528 Francis gave him 
the duchy of Nemours and married him to Charlotte of Orl6ans- 
Longueville. He died on the 25th of November 1533. 

His son, James (1531-1585), became duke of Nemours in 
1533. He distinguished himself at the sieges of Lens and Metz 
(r 552-1 553), at the battle of Renty (1554) and in the campaign 
of Piedmont (1555). He was a supporter of the Guises, and had 
to retire for some time into Savoy in consequence of a plot. 
On his return to France he fought the Huguenots, and signalized 
himself by his successes in Dauphine and Lyonnais. In 1567 he 
induced the court to return from Meaux to Paris, took part in 
the battle of St. Denis, protested against the peace of Long- 
jumcau, and repulsed the invasion of Wolfgang, count palatine 
of Zweibriicken. He devoted his last years to letters and art, 
and died at Annecy on the 15th of June 1585. 

By his wife Anne of Este, the widow of Francis, duke of 
Guise, the duke left a son, Charles Emmanuel (1567-1595), 
who in his youth was called prince of Genevois. Involved 
in political intrigues by his relationship with the Guises, he was 
imprisoned after the assassination of Henry, duke of Guise, 
and his brother the cardinal of Lorraine, in 1588, but contrived to 
escape. He fought at Ivry and Arques, and was governor of 
Paris when it was besieged by Henry IV. After quarreling 
with his half-brother Charles of Lorraine, duke of Mayenne, he 
withdrew to his government of Lyonnais, where he endeavoured 
to make himself independent. He was imprisoned, however, 
in the chateau of Pierrc-Encise by the archbishop of Lyons. 
After his escape he attacked Lyons, but was defeated owing 



to the intervention of the constable de Montmorency. He died 
at Annecy in July 1595. 

His brother Henry (1572-1632), called originally marquis de 
Saint-Sorlin, succeeded him as duke. In 1588 he took the 
marquisate of Saluzzo from the French for his cousin, the duke 
of Savoy. The princes of Guise, his half-brothers, induced 
him to join the League, and in 1591 he was made governor of 
Dauphin6 in the name of that faction. He made his submission 
to Henry IV. in 1596. After quarrelling with the duke of Savoy 
he withdrew to Burgundy and joined the Spaniards in their 
war against Savoy. After peace had been proclaimed on the 
14th of November 161 6, he retired to the French court. He died 
in 1632, and was succeeded by his eldest son, Louis, and on the 
death of the latter in 1641 by his second son, Charles Amadeus 
(1624-1652), who served in the army of Flanders in 1645, an d 
in the following year commanded the light cavalry at the siege 
of Courtrai. In 1652 he took part in the war of the Fronde, and 
fought at Bleneau and at the Faubourg St Antoine, where he 
was wounded. On the 30th of July of the same year he was 
killed in a duel by his brother-in-law, Francois de Vend6me, 
duke of Beaufort. He had two daughters, Marie Jeanne Baptiste 
(d. 1724), who married Charles Emmanuel of Savoy in 1665; 
and Marie Francoise Elisabeth, who married Alphonso VI., 
king of Portugal, in 1666. His brother Henry (1625-1659), 
who had been archbishop of Reims, but now withdrew from 
orders, succeeded to the title. In 1657 he married Marie 
d'Orleans-Longueville (1625-1707), daughter of Henry II. 
of Orleans, duke of Longueville. This duchess of Nemours is 
a famous personage. At an early age she was involved in 
the first Fronde, which was directed by her father and her 
stepmother. Anne Genevieve de Bourbon-Conde, the cele- 
brated duchesse de Longueville; and when her husband died 
in 1659, leaving her childless, the rest of her life was mainly 
spent in contesting her inheritance with her stepmother. She 
left some interesting MSmoires, which are published by C. B. 
Petitot in the Collection compute des mimoires (1819-1829). 

NEMOURS, LOUIS CHARLES PHILIPPE RAPHAEL, Due de 
(1814-1S96), second son of the duke of Orleans, afterwards 
King Louis Philippe, was born on the 25th of October 1814. 
At twelve years of age he was nominated colonel of the first 
regiment of chasseurs, and in r83© he became a chevalier of the 
order of the Saint Esprit and entered the chamber of peers. 
As early as 1825 his name was mentioned as a possible candidate 
for the throne of Greece, and in 183 1 he was elected king of 
the Belgians, but international considerations deterred Louis 
Philippe from accepting the honour for his son. In February 1 83 1 
he accompanied the French army which entered Belgium to 
support the new kingdom against Holland, and took part in 
the siege of Antwerp. He accompanied the Algerian expedition 
against the town of Constantine in the autumn of 1836, and in a 
second expedition (1837) he was entrusted with the command 
of a brigade and with the direction of the siege operations before 
Constantine. General Damr6mont was killed by his side on the 
1 2th of October, and the place was taken by assault on the 13th. 
He sailed a third time for Algeria in 1841, and served under 
General Bugeaud, taking part in the expedition to revictual 
Medea on the 29th of April, and in sharp fighting near Miliana 
on the 3rd to 5th of May. In the expedition against the fortified 
town of Takdempt he commanded the 1st infantry division. 
On his return to France he became commandant of the camp 
of Compiegne. He had been employed on missions of courtesy 
to England in r835, in 1838 and in 1845, and to Berlin and 
Vienna in 1836. The occasion of his marriage in 1840 with 
Victoria, daughter of Duke Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg, was 
marked by a check to Louis Philippe *s government in the form 
of a refusal to bestow the marriage dowry proposed by Thiers in 
the chamber of deputies. The death of his elder brother, 
Ferdinand, duke of Orleans, in 1842 gave him a position of greater 
importance as the natural regent in the case of the accession of 
his nephew, the young count of Paris. His reserve and dislike 
of public functions, with a certain haughtiness of manner, how- 
ever, made him unpopular. On the outbreak of the revolution of

1848 he held the Tuileries long enough to cover the king's retreat, 
but refrained from initiating active measures against the mob. 
He followed his sister-in-law, the duchess of Orleans, and her two 
sons to the chamber of deputies, but was separated from them 
by the rioters, and only escaped finally by disguising himself 
in the uniform of a national guard. He embarked for England, 
where he settled with his parents at Claremont. His chief aim 
during his exile, especially after his father's death, was a re- 
conciliation between the two branches of the house of Bourbon, 
as indispensable to the re-establishment of the French monarchy 
in any form. These wishes were frustrated on the one hand 
by the attitude of the comte de Chambord, and on the other 
by the determination of the duchess of Orleans to maintain the 
pretensions of the count of Paris. Nemours was prepared to 
go further than the other princes of his family in accepting the 
principles of the legitimists, but lengthy negotiations ended 
in 1857 with a letter, written by Nemours, as he subsequently 
explained, at the dictation of his brother, Francois, prince de 
Joinville, in which he insisted that Chambord should express 
his adherence to the tricolour flag and to the principles of con- 
stitutional government. In 1871 the Orleans princes renewed 
their professions of allegiance to the senior branch of their house, 
but they were not consulted when the count of Chambord came 
to Paris in 1873, and their political differences remained until 
his death in 1883. 

Nemours had lived at Bushey House after the death of Queen 
Marie Amelie in 1866. In 1871 the exile imposed on the French 
princes was withdrawn, but he only transferred his establishment 
to Paris after their disabilities were also removed. In March 
1872 he was restored to his rank in the army as general of division, 
and placed in the first section of the general staff. After his 
retirement from the active list he continued to act as president 
of the Red Cross Society until 1881, when new decrees against 
the princes of the blood led to his withdrawal from Parisian 
society. During the presidency of Marshal MacMahon, he had 
appeared from time to time at the filysee. He died at Versailles 
on the 26th of June 1896, the duchess having died at Claremont 
on the 10th of November 1857. Their children were Louis 
Philippe Marie Ferdinand Gaston, comte d'Eu (b. 1842), who 
married Isabella, eldest daughter of Don Pedro II. of Brazil; 
Ferdinand Philippe Marie, due d'Alencon (b. 1844), who married 
Sophie of Bavaria (1 847-1 897), sister of the empress Elizabeth 
of Austria; Margaret (1846-1893), who married Prince Ladislas 
Czartoryski; and Blanche (b. 1857).

NEMOURS, a town of northern France, in the department of 
Seine-et-Marne, on the Loing and its canal, 26 m. S. of Melun, 
on the Paris-Lyon railway. -Pop. (1906) 4814. The church, 
which dates mainly from the 16th century, has a handsome 
wooden spire, and there is a feudal castle. A statue of the 
mathematician Bezout (d. 1783), a native of the town, was erected 
in 1885. In the vicinity is a group of fine sandstone rocks, and 
sand is extensively quarried. Nemours is supposed to derive its 
name from the woods (nemora) in the midst of which it formerly 
stood, and discoveries of Gallo-Roman remains indicate its early 
origin. It was captured by the English in 1420, but derives its 
historical importance rather from the lordship (afterwards 
duchy) to which it gave its name. In 1585 a treaty revoking 
previous concessions to the Protestants was concluded at Nemours 
between Catherine de Medici and the Guises. 

NENADOVICH, MATEYA (1777-1854), Servian patriot, was 
born in 1777. He is generally called Prota Mateya, since as a 
boy of sixteen he was made a priest, and a few years later hecame 
archpriest (Prota) of Valyevo. His father, Alexa Nenadovich, 
Knez (chief magistrate) of the district of Valyevo, was one of the 
most popular and respected public men among the Servians at 
the beginning of the 19th century. When the four leaders of 
the Janissaries of the Belgrade Pashalic (the so-called Dahis) 
thought that the only way to prevent a general rising of the 
Servians was to intimidate them by murdering all their principal 
men, Alexa Nenadovich was one of the first victims. The 



policy of the Dahis, instead of preventing, did actually and 
immediately provoke a general insurrection of the Servians 
against the Turks. Prota Mateya became the deputy-commander 
of the insurgents of the Valyevo district (1804), but did not 
hold the post for long, as Karageorge sent him in 1805 on a secret 
mission to St Petersburg, and afterwards employed him almost 
constantly as Servians diplomatic envoy to Russia, Austria, 
Bucharest and Constantinople. After the fall of Karageorge 
(1813), the new leader of the Servians, Milosh Obrenovich, sent 
Prota Mateya as representative of Servia to the Congress of 
Vienna (1814-1815), where he pleaded the Servian cause inde- 
fatigably. During that mission he often saw Lord Castlereagh, 
and for the first time the Servian national interests were hrought 
to the knowledge of British statesmen. 

Prota Mateya's memoirs are the most valuable authority for the 
history of the first and second Servian insurrections against the 
Turks. The best edition of the Memoari Prole Mateye Nenadovicha 
was published by the Servian Literary Association in Belgrade in 
1893.

4704. Of the old castle, called Nenagh Round, dating from the 
time of King John, there still exists the circular donjon or keep. 
There are no remains of the hospital founded in 1200 for Austin 
canons, nor of the Franciscan friary, founded in the reign of 
Henry III. and one of the richest religious houses in Ireland. The 
town is governed by an urban district council. It was one of the 
ancient manors of the Butlers, who received for it the grant of a 
fair from Henry VIII. In 1550 the town and friary were burned 
by O'Carroll. In i64r the town was taken by Owen Roe O'Neill, 
but shortly afterwards it was recaptured by Lord Inchiquin. 
It surrendered to Ireton in 165 1, and was hurned by Sarsfield in 
1688. 

NENNIUS (fl. 796), a Welsh writer to whom we owe the 
Historia Britonum, lived and wrote in Brecknock or Radnor. 
His work is known to us through thirty manuscripts; hut the 
earliest of these cannot be dated much earlier than the year 1000; 
and all are defaced by interpolations which give to the work so 
confused a character that critics were long disposed to treat it 
as an unskilful forgery. A new turn was given to the controversy 
by Heinrich Zimmer, who, in his Nennius vindicatus (1893), 
traced the history of the work and, by a comparison of the 
manuscripts with the 11th-century translation of the Irish 
scholar, Gilla Coemgim (d. 1072), succeeded in stripping off the 
later accretions from the original nucleus of the Historia. Zimmer 
follows previous critics in rejecting the Prologus maior (§§ 1, 2), 
the Capitulaj or table of contents, and part of the Mirabilia 
which form the concluding section. But he proves that Nennius 
should be regarded as the compiler of the Historia proper (§§ 7-65). 
Zimmer's conclusions are of more interest to literary critics than 
to historians. The only part of the Historia which deserves to 
be treated as a historical document is the section known as the 
Genealogiae Saxonum (§§ 57-65). This is merely a recension of 
a work which was composed ahout 679 by a Briton of Strathclyde. 
The author's name is unknown; hut he is, after Gildas, our 
earliest authority for the facts of the English conquest of England. 
Nennius himself gives us the oldest legends relating to . the 
victories of King Arthur; the value of the Historic from this 
point of view is admitted hy the severest critics. The chief 
authorities whom Nennius followed were Gildas' De excidio 
Britonurn, Eusebius, the Vita Patricii of Murichu Maccu Mach- 
theni, the Collectanea of Tirechan, the Liber ocenpationis (an 
Irish work on the settlement of Ireland), the Liber de sex 
aetatibus mitndi, the chronicle of Prosper of Aquitaine, the 
Liber beati Germanu The sources from which he derived his 
notices of King Arthur (§ 56) have not been determined.

NEO-CAESAREA, SYNOD OF— NEOPLATONISM 



NEO-CAESAREA, SYNOD OF, a synod held shortly after that 
of Ancyra, probably about 314 or 315 (although Hefele inclines 
to put it somewhat later). Its principal work was the adoption 
of fifteen disciplinary canons, which were subsequently accepted 
as ecumenical by the Council of Chalcedon, 451, and of which the 
most important are the following: i. degrading priests who 
marry after ordination; vii. forbidding a priest to be present 
at the second marriage of any one; viii. refusing ordination 
to the husband of an adulteress; xi. fixing thirty years as the 
age below which one might not be ordained (because Christ 
began His public ministry at the age of thirty); xiii. according 
to city priests the precedence over country priests; xiv. per- 
mitting Chorepiscopi to celebrate the sacraments; xv. requiring 
that there be seven deacons in every city. 

See Mansi ii. pp. 539-551; Hardouin i. pp. 282-286; Hefele 
(2nded.) i. pp. 242-251 (Eng. trans, i. pp. 222-230). (T. F. C.) 

NEOCOMIAN, in geology, the name given to the lowest stage 
of the Cretaceous system. It was introduced by J. Thurmann 
in 1835 on account of the development of these rocks at Neuchatel 
(Neocomum), Switzerland. It has been employed in more than 
one sense. In the type area the rocks have been divided into 
two sub-stages, a lower, Valanginian (from Valengin, E. Desor, 
1854) and an upper, Hauterivian (from Hauterive, E. Renevier, 
1874) ; there is also another local sub-stage, the infra- Valanginian 
or Berriasian (from Berrias, H. Coquand, 1876), These three 
sub-stages constitute the Neocomian in its restricted sense. 
A. von Koenen and other German geologists extend the use 
of the term to include the whole of the Lower Cretaceous up to 
the top of the Gault or Albian. Renevier divided the Lower 
Cretaceous into the Neocomian division, embracing the three 
sub-stages mentioned above, and an Urgonian division, including 
the Barremian, Rhodanian and Aptian sub-stages. Sir A. 
Geikie (Text Book 0} Geology , 4th ed., 1903) regards " Neocomian" 
as synonymous with Lower Cretaceous, and he, like Renevier, 
closes this portion of the system at the top of the Lower Green- 
sand (Aptian). Other British geologists (A. J. Jukes-Browne, 
&c.) restrict the Neocomian to the marine beds of Speeton and 
Tealby, and their estuarine equivalents, the Weald Clay and 
Hastings Sands (Wealden). Much confusion would be avoided 
by dropping the term Neocomian entirely and employing 
instead, for the type area, the sub-divisions given above. This 
becomes the more obvious when it is pointed out that the 
Berriasian type is limited to Dauphine; the Valanginian has 
not a much wider range; and the Hauterivian does not extend 
north of the Paris basin. 

Characteristic fossils of the Berriasian are Hoplites euthytni, H. 
occitanicus; of the Valanginian, Natica leviathan, Belemnites j>istil- 
liformis and B. dilatatus t Oxynoticeras Gevrili\ of the Hauterivian, 
Hoplites radiatus, Crioceras capricornu, Exogyra Couloni and Toxaster 
complanatus. The marine equivalents of these rocks in England arc 
the lower Speeton Clays of Yorkshire and the Tealby beds of Lincoln- 
shire. The Wealden beds of southern England represent approxi- 
mately an estuarine phase of deposit of the same age. The Hils 
clay of Germany and Wealden of Hanover; the limestones and 
shales of Teschen; the Aptychus and Pygope diphyoides marls of 
Spain, and the Petchorian formation of Russia are equivalents of 
the Neocomian in its narrower sense.

NEOCORATE, a rank or dignity granted by the Senate under 
the Roman' Empire to certain cities of Asia, which had built 
temples for the worship' of the emperors or had established 
cults of members of the imperial family. The Greek word 
v&tiKbpos meant literally a temple-sweeper (pecos, temple, Kopeiv, 
to sweep), and was thence used both of a temple attendant 
and of a priestly holder of high rank who was in charge of a 
temple. 

NEOLITHIC, or Later Stone Age (Gr. vkos t new, and Xi0os, 
'stone), a term employed first byLordAvebury and since generally 
accepted, for the period of highly finished and polished stone 
implements, in contrast with the rude workmanship of those 
of the earlier Stone Age (Palaeolithic). Knowledge of Neolithic 
times is derived principally from four sources, Tumuli or ancient 
burial-mounds, the Lake-dwellings of Switzerland, the Kitchen- 
middens of Denmark and the Bone-Caves. No trace of metal 



is found, except gold, which seems to have been sometimes used 
for ornaments. Agriculture, pottery, weaving, the domestica- 
tion of animals, the burying of the dead in dolmens, and the 
rearing of megalithic monuments are the typical developments 
of man during this stage. [

NEOPHYTE (Gr. veb<j>VTos , from veos, new, <j>vrov, a plant, 
" newly planted "), a word used in the Eleusinian and other 
mysteries to designate the newly initiated, and in the early 
church applied to newly baptized persons. These usually 
wore the white garments which they received at their admission 
to the church (see Baptism) for eight days, from Easter eve till 
the Sunday after Easter (hence called Dominica in albi$) } but 
they were subject to strict supervision for some time longer 
and, on the authority of 1 Tim. iii, 6, were generally held 
ineligible for election as bishops, a rule to which, however, history 
shows some notable exceptions, as in the cases of St Ambrose 
at Milan in 374 and Synesius of Cyrene at Ptolemais in 409, 
who were chosen bishops before they were even baptized. By 
the council of Nicaea (325) this rule was extended to the priest- 
hood. The ancient discipline is still maintained in the Roman 
Church, and applies to converts from Christian sects as well 
as to those from heathenism. The period, however, is deter- 
mined by circumstances. The term " neophyte " is also some- 
times applied in the Roman Church to newly ordained priests, 
and even — though rarely — to novices of a religious order. In 
a transferred sense the word is also given to one beginning to 
learn any new subject.

NEOPLATONISM, the name given specially to the last school 
of pagan philosophy, which grew up mainly among the Greeks 
of Alexandria from the 3rd century onwards. The term has 
also been applied to the Italian humanists of the Renaissance, 
and in modern times, somewhat vaguely, to thinkers who have 
based their speculations on the Platonic metaphysics or on 
Plotinus, and incorporated with it a tendency towards a mystical 
explanation of ultimate phenomena. 

Historical Position and Significance. — The political history 
of the ancient world ends with the formation, under Diocletian 
and Constantine, of a universal state bearing the cast of Oriental 
as well as Graeco-Roman civilization. The history of ancient 
philosophy ends in like manner with a universal philosophy 
which assimilated elements of almost all the earlier systems, 
and worked up the results of Eastern and Western culture. 
Just as the Later Roman empire was at once the supreme effort 
of the old world and the outcome of its exhaustion, so Neo- 
platonism is in one aspect the consummation, in another the 
collapse, of ancient philosophy. Never before in Greek or 
in Roman speculation had the consciousness of man's dignity 
and superiority to nature found such adequate expression; 
never before had real science and pure knowledge been so under- 
valued and despised by the leaders of culture as they were by 
the Neoplatonists. Judged from the standpoint of empirical 
science, philosophy passed its meridian in Plato and Aristotle, 
declined in the post -Aristotelian systems, and set in the darkness 
of Neoplatonism. But, from the religious and moral point of 
view, it must be admitted that the ethical " mood " which 
Neoplatonism endeavoured to create and maintain is the highest 
and purest ever reached by antiquity. 

It is a proof of the strength of the moral instincts of mankind 
that the only phase of culture which we -can survey in all its 
stages from beginning to end culminated not in materialism, 
but in the boldest idealism. This idealism, however, is also 
in its way a mark of intellectual bankruptcy. Contempt for 
reason and science leads in the end to barbarism — its necessary 
consequence being the rudest superstition. As a matter of fact, 
barbarism did break out after the flower had fallen from Neo- 
platonism, The philosophers themselves, no doubt, still lived 



NEOPLATONISM 



373 



on the knowledge they repudiated; but the masses were trained 
to a superstition with which the Christian church, as the executor 
of Neoplatonism, had to reckon and contend. By a fortunate 
coincidence, at the very moment when this bankruptcy of the 
old culture must have become apparent, the stage of history 
was occupied by barbaric peoples. This has obscured the fact 
that the inner history of antiquity, ending as it did in despair 
of this world, must in any event have seen a recurrence of 
barbarism. The present world was a thing that men would 
neither enjoy nor master nor study. A new world was discovered, 
for the sake of which everything else was abandoned; to 
make sure of that world insight and intelligence were freely 
sacrificed; and, in the light that streamed from beyond, the 
absurdities of the present became wisdom, and its wisdom 
became foolishness. 

Such is Neoplatonism. The pre-Socratic philosophy took 
its stand on natural science, to the exclusion of ethics and 
religion. The systems of Plato and Aristotle sought to adjust 
the rival claims of physics and ethics (although the supremacy 
of the latter was already acknowledged); but the popular 
religions were thrown overboard. The post - Aristotelian 
philosophy in all its branches makes withdrawal from the 
objective world its starting-point. It might seem, indeed, that 
Stoicism indicates a falling off from Plato and Aristotle towards 
materialism, but the ethical dualism, which was the ruling 
tendency of the Stoa, could not long endure its materialistic 
physics, and took refuge in the metaphysical dualism of the 
Platonists. But this originated no permanent philosophical 
creation. From one-sided Platonism issued the various forms 
of scepticism, the attempt to undermine the trustworthiness 
of empirical knowledge. Neoplatonism, coming last, borrowed 
something from all the schools. First, it stands in the line 
of post-Aristotelian systems; it is, in fact, as a subjective philo- 
sophy, their logical completion. Secondly, it is founded on 
scepticism; for it has neither interest in, nor reliance upon, 
empirical knowledge. Thirdly, it can justly claim the honour 
of Plato's name, since it expressly goes back to him for its 
metaphysics, directly combating those of the Stoa. Yet even 
on this point it learned something from the Stoics; the Neo- 
platonic conception of the action of the Deity on the world and 
of the essence and origin of matter can only be explained by 
reference to the dynamic pantheism of the Stoa. Fourthly, 
the study of Aristotle also exercised an influence on Neoplatonism. 
. This appears not only in its philosophical method, but also — 
though less prominently — in its metaphysic. And, fifthly, Neo- 
platonism adopted the ethics of Stoicism; although it was 
found necessary to supplement them by a still higher conception 
of the functions of the spirit. 

Thus, with the exception of Epicureanism — which was always 
treated by Neoplatonism as its mortal enemy — there is no out- 
standing earlier system which did not Contribute something to 
the new philosophy. And yet Neoplatonism cannot be described 
as an eclectic system, in the ordinary sense of the word. For, in 
the first place, it is dominated by one all-pervading interest — the 
religious; and in the second place, it introduced a new first 
principle into philosophy, viz. the supra-rational, that which 
lies beyond reason and beyond reality. This principle is not to 
be identified with the "idea" of Plato or with the "form" of 
Aristotle. Neoplatonism perceived that neither sense perception 
nor rational cognition is a sufficient basis or justification for 
religious ethics; consequently it broke away from rationalistic 
ethics as decidedly as from utilitarian morality. It had therefore 
to find out a new world and a new spiritual function, in order 
first to establish the existence of what it desiderated, and then 
to realize and describe what it had proved to exist. Man, how- 
ever, cannot transcend his psychological endowment. If he will 
not allow his thought to be determined by experience, he falls 
a victim to his imagination. In other words, thought, which will 
not stop, takes to mythology; and in the place of reason we 
have superstition. Still, as we cannot allow every fancy of the 
subjective reason to assert itself, we require some new and potent 
principle to keep the imagination within bounds. This is found 



in the authority of a sound tradition. Such authority must be 
superhuman, otherwise it can have no claim on our respect; it 
must, therefore, be divine. The highest sphere of knowledge — 
the supra-rational — as well as the very possibility of knowledge, 
must depend on divine communications — that is, on revelations. 
In short, philosophy as represented by Neoplatonism, its sole 
interest being a religious interest, and its highest object the supra- 
rational, must be a philosophy of revelation. 

This is not a prominent feature in Plotinus or his immediate 
disciples, who still exhibit full confidence in the subjective pre- 
suppositions of their philosophy. But the later adherents of the 
school did not possess this confidence 1 ; they based their philo- 
sophy on revelations of the Deity, and they found these in the 
religious traditions and rites of all nations. The Stoics had 
taught them to overstep the political boundaries of states and 
nationalities, and rise from the Hellenic to a universal human 
consciousness. Through all history the spirit of God has breathed ; 
everywhere we discover the traces of His revelation. The older 
any religious tradition or mode of worship is, the more venerable is 
it, the richer in divine ideas. Hence the ancient religions of the 
East had a peculiar interest for the Neoplatonist. In the inter- 
pretation of myths Neoplatonism followed the allegorical method, 
as practised especially by the Stoa; but the importance it 
attached to the spiritualized myths was unknown to the Stoic 
philosophers. The latter interpreted the myths and were done 
with them; the later Neoplatonists treated them as the proper 
material and the secure foundation of philosophy. Neoplatonism 
claimed to be not merely the absolute philosophy, the keystone 
of all previous systems, but also the absolute religion, reinvigorat- 
ing and transforming all previous religions. It contemplated a 
restoration of all the religions of antiquity, by allowing each to 
retain its traditional forms, and at the same time making each a 
vehicle for the religious attitude and the religious truth embraced 
in Neoplatonism; while every form of ritual was to become a 
stepping-stone to a high morality worthy of mankind. In short, 
Neoplatonism seizes on the aspiration of the human soul after a 
higher life, and treats this psychological fact as the key to the 
interpretation of the universe. Hence the existing religions, 
after being refined and spiritualized, were made the basis of 
philosophy. * 

Neoplatonism thus represents a stage in the history of religion; 
indeed this is precisely where its historical importance lies. 
In the progress of science and enlightenment it has no positive 
significance, except as a necessary transition which the race had 
to make in order to get rid of nature-religion, and that under- 
valuing of the spiritual life which formed an insuperable obstacle 
to the advance of human knowledge. Neoplatonism, however, 
failed as signally in its religious enterprise as it did in its phil- 
osophical. While seeking to perfect ancient philosophy, it really 
extinguished it; and in like manner its attempted reconstruction 
$>f ancient religions only resulted in their destruction. For in 
requiring these religions to impart certain prescribed religious 
truths, and to inculcate the highest moral tone, it burdened them 
with problems to which they were unequal. And further, by 
inviting them to loosen, though not exactly to dissolve, their 
political allegiance — the very thing that gave them stability — 
it removed the foundation on which they rested. But might it 
not then have placed them on a broader and firmer foundation? 
Was not the universal empire of Rome ready at hand, and might 
not the new religion have stood to it in the same relation of 
dependence which the earlier religions had held to the smaller 
nations and states? This was no longer possible. It is true that 
the political and spiritual histories of the peoples on the Mediter- 
ranean run in parallel lines, the one leading up to the universal 
monarchy of Rome, the other leading up to monotheism and 
universal human morality. But the spiritual development had 
shot far ahead of the political; even the Stoa occupied a height 
far beyond the reach of anything in the political sphere. It is 
also true that Neoplatonism sought to come to an understanding

with the Byzantine Roman empire; Julian perished in the 
pursuit of this project. But even before his day the shrewder 
Neoplatonists had seen that their lofty religious philosophy could 
not stoop to an alliance with the despotic world-empire, because 
it could not come in contact with the world at all. To Neo- 
platonism political affairs are at bottom as indifferent as all other 
earthly things. The idealism of the new philosophy was too 
heavenly to be naturalized in the Byzantine empire, which stood 
more in need of police officials than of philosophers. Important 
and instructive, therefore, as arc the attempts made from time 
to time by the state and by individual philosophers to unite 
Neoplatonism and the universal monarchy, their failure was a 
foregone conclusion. 

There is one other question which we are called upon to raise 
here. Why did not Neoplatonism set up an independent religious 
community? Why did it not provide for its mixed multitude of 
divinities by founding a universal church, in which all the gods of 
all nations might be worshipped along with the one ineffable 
Deity? The answer to this question involves the answer to 
another — Why was Neoplatonism defeated by Christianity? 
Three essentials of a permanent religious foundation were want- 
ing in Neoplatonism; they are admirably indicated in Augustine's 
Confessions (vii. 18-21). First, and chiefly, it lacked a religious 
founder; second, it could not tell how the state of inward peace 
and blessedness could become permanent; third, it had no 
means to win those who were not endowed with the speculative 
faculty. The philosophical discipline which it recommended 
for the attainment of the highest good was beyond the reach of 
the masses; and the way by which the masses could attain .the 
highest good was a secret unknown to Neoplatonism. Thus it 
remained a school for the " wise and prudent "; and when Julian 
tried to enlist the sympathies of the common rude man for the 
doctrines and worship of this school, he was met with scorn and 
ridicule. 

It is not as a philosophy, then, nor as a new religion, that 
Neoplatonism became a decisive factor in history, but, if one 
may use the expression, as a " mood." The instinctive certainty 
that there is a supreme good, lying beyond empirical experience, 
and yet not an intellectual good — this feeling, and the accom- 
panying conviction of the utter vanity of all earthly things, 
were produced and sustained by Neoplatonism. Only it could 
not describe the nature of this highest good; and there- 
fore it had to abandon itself to imagination and aesthetic im- 
pressions. It changed thought into an emotional dream; 
it plunged into the ocean of sentiment; it treated the old world 
of fable as the reflection of a higher reality, and transformed 
reality into poetry; and after all these expedients, to borrow 
a phrase of Augustine's, it only saw afar off the land of its 
desire. 

Yet the influence of Neoplatonism on the history of our 
ethical culture is immeasurable, above all because it begot 
the consciousness that the only blessedness which can satisfy 
the heart must be sought higher even than the sphere of reason. 
That man shall not live by bread alone, the world had learned 
before Neoplatonism; but Neoplatonism enforced the deeper 
truth — a truth which the older philosophy had missed — that 
man shall not live by knowledge alone. And, besides the pro- 
paedeutic importance which thus belongs to it, another fact 
has to be taken into account in estimating the influence of 
Neoplatonism. It is to this day the nursery of that whole type 
of devotion which affects renunciation of the world, which 
strives after an ideal, without the strength to rise above aesthetic 
impressions, and is never able to form a clear conception of the 
object of its own aspiration. 

Origin, — As forerunners of Neoplatonism we may regard, 
on the one hand, those Stoics who accepted the Platonic dis- 
tinction between the sensible world and the intelligible, and, 
on the other hand, the so-called Neopythagoreans and religious 
philosophers like Plutarch of Chaeronea and especially Numenius 
of Apamea. But these cannot be considered the actual pro- 
genitors of Neoplatonism; their philosophic method is quite 
elementary as compared with the Neoplatonic, their fundamental 



principles are uncertain, and unbounded deference is still paid 
to the authority of Plato. The Jewish and Christian thinkers 
of the first two centuries approach considerably nearer than 
Numenius to the later Neoplatonism. 1 Here we have Philo, 
to begin with. Philo, who translated the Old Testament religion 
into the terms of Hellenic thought, holds as an inference from 
his theory of revelation that the divine Supreme Being is " supra- 
rational," that He can be reached only through " ecstasy ", 
and that the oracles of God supply the material of moral and 
religious knowledge. The religious ethics of Philo — a compound 
of Stoic, Platonic and Neopythagorean elements — already 
bear the peculiar stamp which we recognize in Neoplatonism. 
While his system assigns the supremacy to Greek philosophy 
over the national religion of Israel, it exacts from the former, 
as a sort of tribute to the latter, the recognition of the elevation 
of God above the province of reason. The claim of positive 
religion to be something more than the intellectual apprehension 
of the reason in the universe is thus acknowledged. Religious 
syncretism is also a feature of Philo's system, but it differs 
essentially from what we find in later Neoplatonism. For 
Philo pays no respect to any cultus except the Jewish; and he 
believed that all the fragments of truth to be found amongst 
Greeks and Romans had been borrowed from the books of Moses. 
The earliest Christian philosophers, particularly Justin and 
Athenagoras, likewise prepared the way for the speculations 
of the Neoplatonists — partly by their attempts to connect 
Christianity with Stoicism and Platonism, partly by their 
ambition to exhibit Christianity as " hyperplatonic." In the 
introduction to his Dialogue with Trypho, Justin follows a 
method which bears a striking resemblance to the later method 
of Neoplatonism: he seeks to base the Christian^, knowledge 
of God — that is, the knowledge of the truth — on Platonism, 
Scepticism and " Revelation." A still more remarkable parallel 
to the later Neoplatonism is afforded by the Christian Gnostics 
of Alexandria,_espccially Valentinus and the followers of Basilides. 2 
Like the Neoplatonists, the Basilidians believed, not in an 
emanation from the Godhead, but in a dynamic manifestation 
of its activity. The same is true of Valentinus, who also placed 
an unnameable being at the apex of his system, and regarded 
matter, not as a second principle, but as a product of the one 
divine principle. It must be added that the dependence of 
Basilides and Valentinus on Zeno and Plato is beyond dispute. 
But the method observed by these Gnostics in thinking out the 
plan and the history of the universe is by no means thoroughgoing. 
Ancient myths are admitted without undergoing analysis; the 
most naive realism alternates with daring efforts at spiritualiz- 
ing. Philosophically considered, therefore, the Gnostic systems 
are very unlike the rigorous self-consistency of Neoplatonism; 
although they certainly contain almost all the elements which 
enter into the Neoplatonic theory of the universe. 

But were the oldest Neoplatonists really acquainted with 
the speculations of Philo, or Justin, or Valentinus, or Basilides? 
Did they know the Oriental religions, Judaism and Christianity 
in particular? And, if so, did they really derive anything from 
these sources? 

To these questions we cannot give decided, still less definite 
and precise, answers. Since Neoplatonism originated in 
Alexandria, where Oriental modes of worship were accessible 
to every one, and since the Jewish philosophy had also taken 
its place in the literary circles of Alexandria, we may safely 
assume that even the earliest of the Neoplatonists possessed 

1 The resemblance would probably be still more apparent if we 
thoroughly understood the development of Christianity at Alexandria 
in the 2nd century; but unfortunately we have only very meagre 
fragments to guide us here.

NEOPLATONISM 



an acquaintance with Judaism and Christianity. But if we 
search Plotinus for evidence of any actual influence of Jewish 
and Christian philosophy, we search in vain; and the existence 
of any such influence is all the more unlikely because it is only 
the later Neoplatonism that offers striking and deep-rooted 
parallels to Philo and the Gnostics. The Philonic and Gnostic 
philosophies thus appear to be merely an historical anticipation 
of the Neoplatonic, without any real connexion. Nor is there 
anything mysterious in such an anticipation. It simply means 
that a certain religious and philosophical tendency, which 
grew up slowly on Greek soil, was already implanted in those 
who occupied the vantage-ground of a revealed religion of redemp- 
tion. We have to come down to Iamblichus and his school 
before we find complete correspondence with the Christian 
Gnosticism of the 2nd century; that is to say, it is only in the 
4th century that Greek philosophy in its proper development 
reaches the stage at which certain Greek philosophers who 
had embraced Christianity had arrived in the 2nd century. 
The influence of Christianity — whether Gnostic or Catholic 
— on Neoplatonism was at no time very considerable, although 
individual Neoplatonists, after Amelius, used Christian texts 
as oracles, and put on record their admiration for Christ. 

History and Doctrines. — The founder of the Neoplatonic school 
in Alexandria is supposed to have been Ammonius Saccas (q.v.). 

Plotinus ** ut t ^ ie E,nnea ^ s °f n * s pupil Plotinus are the primary 
and classical document of Neoplatonism. The doctrine 
of Plotinus is mysticism, and like all mysticism it consists of 
two main divisions. The first or theoretical part deals with the 
high origin of the human soul, and shows how it has departed 
from its first estate. In the second or practical part the way 
is pointed out by which the soul may again return to the Eternal 
and Supreme. Since the soul in its longings reaches forth beyond 
all sensible things, beyond the world of ideas even, it follows 
that the highest being must be something supra-rational. The 
system thus embraces three heads — (1) the primeval Being, 
(2) the ideal world and the soul, (3) the phenomenal world. 
We may also, however, in accordance with the views of 
Plotinus, divide thus: (A) the invisible world — (1) the primeval 
Being, (2) the ideal world, (3) the soul; (B) the phenomenal 
world. 

The primeval Being is, as opposed to the many, the One; 
as opposed to the finite, the Infinite, the unlimited. It is the 
source of all life, and therefore absolute causality and the only 
real existence. It is, moreover, the Good, in so far as all finite 
things have their purpose in it, and ought to flow back to it. 
But one cannot attach moral attributes to the original Being 
itself, because these would imply limitation. It has no attributes 
of any kind; it is being without magnitude, without life, without 
thought; in strict propriety, indeed, we ought not to speak 
of it as existing; it is " above existence/' " above goodness." 
It is also active force without a substratum; as active force 
the primeval Being is perpetually producing something else, 
without alteration, or motion, or diminution of itself. This 
production is not a physical process, but an emission of force; 
and, since the product has real existence only in virtue of the 
original existence working in it, Neoplatonism may be described 
as a species of dynamic pantheism. Directly or indirectly, 
everything is brought forth by the " One." In it all things, 
so far as they have being, are divine, and God is all in all. Derived 
existence, however, is not like the original Being itself, but is 
subject to* a lawof diminishing completeness. It is indeed an 
image and reflection of the first Being; but the further the line 
of successive projections is prolonged the smaller is its share 
in the true existence. The totality of being may thus be con- 
ceived as a series of concentric circles, fading away towards 
the verge of non-existence, the force of the original Being in 
. the outermost circle being a vanishing quantity. Each lower 
stage of being is united with the " One " by all the higher stages, 
and receives its share of reality only by transmission through 
them. All derived existence, however, has a drift towards, 
a longing for, the higher, and bends towards it so far as its 
nature will permit. 



375 

The original Being first of all throws out the nous, which is a perfect 
image of the One and the archetype of all existing things. It is at 
once being and thought, ideal world and idea. As image, the nous 
corresponds perfectly to the One, but as derived it is entirely different. 
What Plotinus understands by the nous is the highest sphere acces- 
sible to the human mind (Koarpios jwjt6s), and, along with that, 
pure thought itself. 

The image and product of the motionless nous is the soul, which, 
according to Plotinus is, like the nous, immaterial. Its relation to 
the nous is the same as that of the nous to the One. It stands 
between the nous and the phenomenal world, is permeated and 
illuminated by the former, but is also in contact with the latter. 
The nous is indivisible; the soul may preserve its unity and remain 
in the nous, but at the same time it has the power of uniting with 
the corporeal world and thus being disintegrated. It therefore 
occupiesan intermediate position. As a single soul (world-soul) it 
belongs in essence and destination to the intelligible world; but it 
also embraces innumerable individual souls; and these can either 
submit to be ruled by the nous, or turn aside to the sensual and lose 
themselves in the finite. 

Then the soul, a^ moving essence, generates the corporeal or pheno- 
menal world. This world ought to be so pervaded by the soul that 
its various parts should remain in perfect harmony. Plotinus is no 
dualist, like the Christian Gnostics; he admires the beauty and 
splendour of the world. So long as idea governs matter, or the soul 
governs the body> the world is fair and good. It is an image — 
though a shadowy image — of the upper world, and the degrees of 
better and worse in it are essential to the harmony of the whole. 
But in the actual phenomenal world unity and harmony are replaced 
by strife and discord; the result is a conflict, a becoming and 
vanishing, an illusive existence. And the reason for this state of 
things is that bodies rest on a substratum of matter. Matter is the 
basework of each (rd $6Bos hecurrov ij t\rj); it is the dark principle, the 
indeterminate, that which has no qualities, the ^ bv. Destitute of 
form and idea, it is evil ; as capable of form it is neutral. 

The human souls which have descended into corporeality are those 
which have allowed themselves to be ensnared by sensuality and 
overpowered by lust. They now seek to cut themselves loose from 
their true being; and, striving after independence, they assume a 
false existence. They must turn back from this; and, since they 
have not lost their freedom, a conversion is still possible. 

Here, then, we enter upon the practical philosophy. Along the 
same road by which it descended the soul must retrace its steps back 
to the supreme Good. It must first of all return to itself. This is 
accomplished by the practice of virtue, which aims at likeness to 
God, and leads up to God. In the ethics of Plotinus all the older 
schemes of virtue are taken over and arranged in a graduated series. 
The lowest stage is that of the civil virtues, then follow the purifying, 
and last of all the divine virtues. The civil virtues merely adorn 
the life, without elevating the soul. ' That is the office of the purifying 
virtues, by which the soul is freed from sensuality and led back to 
itself, and thence to the nous. By means of ascetic observances the 
man becomes once more a spiritual and enduring being, free from all 
sin. But there is still a higher attainment; it is not enough to be 
sinless, one must become " God." This is reached through contem- 
plation of the primeval Being, the One — in other words, through an 
ecstatic approach to it. Thought cannot attain to this, for thought 
reaches only to the nous, and is itself a kind of motion. It is only in 
a state of perfect passivity and repose that the soul can recognize 
and touch the primeval Being. Hence the soul must first pass 
through a spiritual curriculum. Beginning with the contemplation 
of corporeal things in their multiplicity and harmony, it then retires 
upon itself and withdraws into the depths of its own being, rising 
thence to the nous, the world of ideas. But even there it does not 
find the Highest, the One; it still hears a voice saying, " not we 
have made ourselves." The last stage is reached when, in the highest 
tension and concentration, beholding in silence and utterforgetful- 
ness of all things, it is able as it were to lose itself. Then it may see 
God, the fountain of life, the source of being, the origin of all good, 
the root of the soul. In that moment it enjoys the highest indescrib- 
able bliss; it is as it were swallowed up of divinity, bathed in the 
light of eternity. 1 

Such is the religious philosophy of Plotinus, and for himself 
personally it sufficed, without the aid of the popular religion 
or worship. Nevertheless he sought for points of support in 
these. God is certainly in the truest sense nothing but the 
primeval Being; but He reveals Himself in a variety of emana- 
tions and manifestations. The nous is a sort of second god, 
the A6yot which are wrapped up in it are gods, the stars are gods, 
and so on. A rigid monotheism appeared to Plotinus a miserable 
conception. He gave a meaning to the myths of the popular 
religions, and he had something to say even for magic, sooth- 
saying and prayer. In support of *image- worship he advanced 

1 Porphyry tells us that on four occasions during the six years of 
their intercourse Plotinus attained to this ecstatic union with God. 



37^ 



NEOPLATONISM 



arguments which were afterwards adopted by the Christian 
image- worshippers. Still, as compared with the later Neo- 
platonists, he is comparatively free from crass superstition and 
wild fanaticism. He is not to be classed amongst the " deceived 
deceivers," and the restoration of the worship of the old gods 
was by no means his chief object. 

Amongst his pupils, Amelius and Porphyry are the most 

eminent. Amelius modified the teaching of Plotinus on certain 

points; and he also put some value on the prologue 

Porphyry. tQ the Gos?d of John To Porphyry ( q v ) belongs the 

credit of having recast and popularized the system of his master 
Plotinus. He was not an original thinker, but a diligent student, 
distinguished hy great learning, by a turn for historical and 
philological criticism, and by an earnest purpose to uproot false 
teaching — especially Christianity, to ennoble men and train 
them to goodness. The system of Porphyry is more emphatically 
practical and religious than that of Plotinus. The object of 
philosophy, according to Porphyry, is the salvation of the soul. 
The origin and the blame of evil are not in the body, but in the 
desires of the soul. Hence the strictest asceticism (abstinence 
from flesh, and wine, and sexual intercourse) is demanded, as 
well as the knowledge of God. As he advanced in life, Porphyry 
protested more and more earnestly against the rude faith of the 
common people and their immoral worships. But, outspoken 
as he was in his criticism of the popular religions, he had no 
wish to give them up. He stood up for a pure worship of the 
many gods, and maintained the cause of every old national 
religion and the ceremonial duties of its adherents. His work 
Against the Christians was directed, not against Christ, nor even 
against what he believed to be Christ's teaching, but against 
the Christians of his own day and their sacred books, which, 
according to Porphyry, were the work of deceivers and ignorant 
people. In his trenchant criticism of the origin of what passed 
for Christianity in his time, he spoke bitter and severe truths, 
which have gained for him the reputation of the most rabid and 
wicked of all the enemies of Christianity. His work was 
destroyed, 1 but the copious extracts which we find in Lactantius, 
Augustine, Jerome, Macarius Magnus and others show how 
profoundly he had studied the Christian writings, and how great 
was his talent for real historical research. 

Porphyry marks the transition to a new phase of Neoplafonism, 
in which it becomes completely subservient to polytheism, and 
seeks before everything else to protect the Greek and 
etas. " Oriental religions from the formidable assault of 
Christianity. In the hands of Iamblichus (q.v.), the 
pupil of Porphyry, Neoplatonism is changed " from a philo- 
sophical theory to a theological doctrine." The distinctive tenets 
of Iamblichus cannot be accounted for from scientific but only 
from practical considerations. In order to justify superstition 
and the ancient forms of worship, philosophy becomes in his hands 
a theurgy, a knowledge of mysteries, a sort of spiritualism. 

To this period also belongs a set of " philosophers," with 
regard to whom it is impossible to say whether they are dupes 
or impostors — the "decepti deceptores" of whom Augustine 
speaks. In this philosophy the mystical properties of numbers 
are a leading feature; absurd and mechanical notions are 
glossed over with the sheen of sacramental mystery; myths are 
explained by pious fancies and fine-sounding pietistic reflections; 
miracles, even the most ridiculous, are believed in, and miracles 
are wrought. The " philosopher " has become a priest of magic 
and philosophy a method of incantation. Moreover, in the 
unbridled exercise of speculation, the number of divine beings 
was increased indefinitely; and these fantastic accessions to 
Olympus in the system of Iamblichus show that Greek philosophy 
is returning to mythology, and that nature-religion is still a 
power in the world. And yet it is undeniable that the very 
noblest and choicest minds of the 4th century are to be found 
in the ranks of the Neoplatonists. So great was the general 
decline that this Neoplatonic philosophy offered a welcome 
shelter to many earnest and influential men, in spite of the

Valentinian in the year 448. 



charlatans and hypocrites who were gathered under the same 
roof. On certain points of doctrine, too, the dogmatic of 
Iamblichus indicates a real advance. Thus his emphatic asser- 
tion of the truth that the seat of evil is in the will is noteworthy; 
and so also is his repudiation of Plotinus's theory of the divinity 
of the soul. 

The numerous followers of Iamblichus — Aedesius, Chrysan- 
thius, Eusebius, Priscus, Sopater, Sallust, and, most famous of 
all, Maximus (q.v.), rendered little service to speculation. Some 
of them (Themistius in particular) are known as commentators 
on the older philosophers, and others as the missionaries of 
mysticism. The work De mysteriis Aegyptiorum is the best 
sample of the views and aims of these philosophers. Their hopes 
rose high when Julian ascended the imperial throne (361-363). 
But the emperor himself lived long enough to see that his 
romantic policy of restoration was to leave no results; and 
after his early death all hope of extinguishing Christianity was 
abandoned. 

But undoubtedly the victory of Christianity in the age of 
Valentinian and Theodosius had a purifying influence on Neo- 
platonism. During the struggle for supremacy, the 
philosophers had been driven to make common cause iBfl " eBce 
with everything that was hostile to Christianity, t^ty*' 
But now Neoplatonism was thrust from the great stage 
of history. The church and church theology, to whose guidance 
the masses now surrendered themselves, took in along with them 
their superstition, their polytheism, their magic, their myths, 
and all the machinery of religious witchcraft. The more all 
this settled and established itself — certainly not without opposi- 
tion — in the church the purer did Neoplatonism become. While 
maintaining intact its religious attitude and its theory of know- 
ledge, it returned with new zest to scientific studies, especially 
the study of the old philosophers. If Plato still remains the 
divine philosopher, yet we can perceive that after the year 400 
the writings of Aristotle are increasingly read and valued. 
In the chief cities of the empire Neoplatonic schools flourished 
till the beginning of the 5th century; during this period, indeed, 
they were the training-schools of Christian theologians. At 
Alexandria the noble Hypatia (q.v.) taught, to whose memory 
her impassioned disciple Synesius, afterwards a bishop, reared a 
splendid monument. But after the beginning of the 5th century 
the fanaticism of the church could no longer endure the presence 
of " heathenism." The murder of Hypatia was the death of 
philosophy in Alexandria, although the school there maintained 
a lingering existence till the middle of the 6th century. But there 
was one city of the East which, lying apart from the crowded 
highways of the world, had sunk to a mere provincial town, and 
yet possessed associations which the church of the 5th century felt 
herself powerless to eradicate. In Athens a Neoplatonic school 
still flourished. There, under the monuments of its glorious 
past, Hellenism found its last retreat. The school of Athens 
returned to a stricter philosophical method and the cultivation 
of scholarship. Still holding by a religious philosophy, it under- 
took to reduce the whole Greek tradition, as seen in the light of 
Plotinus, to a comprehensive and closely knit system. Hence 
the philosophy which arose at Athens was what may fairly be 
termed scholasticism. For every philosophy is scholastic 
whose subject-matter is imaginative and mystical, and which 
handles this subject-matter according to established rules in 
logical categories and distinctions. Now to these Neoplatonists, 
the books of Plato, along with certain divine oracles, fhe Orphic 
poems, and much more which they assigned to a remote antiquity, 
were documents of canonical authority; they were inspired 
divine writings. Out of these they drew the material of their 
philosophy, which they then proceeded to elaborate with the 
appliances of dialectic. 

The most distinguished teachers at Athens were Plutarch 
(q.v.), his disciple Syrianus (who did important work as a com- 
mentator on Plato and Aristotle, and further deserves Proctos. 
mention for his vigorous defence of the freedom of the 
will), but above all Proclus (411-485). Proclus is the great 
schoolman of Neoplatonism. It was he who, combining religious

ardour with formal acuteness, connected the whole mass of 
traditional lore into a huge system, making good defects, and 
smoothing away contradictions by means of distinctions and 
speculations. " It was reserved for Proclus," says Zeller, " to 
bring the Neoplatonic philosophy to its formal conclusion by the 
rigorous consistency of his dialectic, and, keeping in view all 
the modifications which it had undergone in the course of two 
centuries, to give it that form in which it was transferred to 
Christianity and Mahommedamsm in the middle ages." Forty- 
four years after the death of Proclus the school of Athens was 
closed by Justinian (a.d. 529); but it had already fulfilled its 
mission in the work of Proclus. The works of Proclus, as the 
last testament of Hellenism to the church and the middle ages, 
exerted an incalculable influence on the next thousand years. 
They not only formed one of the bridges by which the medieval 
thinkers got back to Plato and Aristotle; they determined the 
scientific method of thirty generations, and they partly created 
and partly nourished the Christian mysticism of the middle ages. 

The disciples of Proclus are not eminent (M annus, Asclepio- 
dotus, Ammonius, Zenodotus, Isidorus, Hegias, Damascius). 
The last president of the Athenian school was Damascius (q.v.). 
When Justinian issued the edict for the suppression of the school, 
Damascius along with Simplicius (the painstaking commentator 
on Aristotle) and five other ^eoplatonists set out to make a home 
in Persia. They found the conditions were unfavourable and 
were allowed to return (see Chosroes I.). 

At the beginning of the 6th century Neoplatonism had ceased 
to exist in the East as an independent philosophy. Almost at 
the same time, however — and the coincidence is not accidental — 
it made new conquests in the church theology through the writings 
of the pseudo-Dionysius. It began to bear fruit in Christian 
mysticism,- and to diffuse a new magical leaven through the 
worship of the church. 

In the West, v where philosophical efforts of any kind had been 
very rare since the 2nd century, and where mystical contempla- 
tion did not meet with the necessary conditions, Neoplatonism 
found a congenial soil only in isolated individuals. C. Marius 
Victorinus (q.v.) translated certain works of Plotinus, and thus 
had a decisive influence on the spiritual history of Augustine 
(Confess, vii. 9, viii. 2). It may be said that Neoplatonism 
influenced the West only through the medium of the church 
theology, or, in some instances, under that disguise. Even 
Boetius (it may now be considered certain) was a catholic 
Christian, although his whole mode of thought was certainly 
Neoplatonic (see Boetius). His violent death in the year 525 
marks the end of independent philosophy in the West. But 
indeed this last of the Roman philosophers stood quite alone 
in his century, and the philosophy for which he lived was neither 
original, nor well-grounded, nor methodically developed. 

Neoplatonism and Ike Theology of the Church. — The question asto 
the influence of Neoplatonism on the development of Christianity 
is not easily answered, because it is scarcely possible to get a com- 
plete view of their mutual relations. The answer will depend, in 
the first instance, upon how much is included under the term " Neo- 
platonism." If Neoplatonism is understood in^ the widest, sense, 
as the highest and fittest expression of the religious movements at 
work in the Graeco-Roman empire from the 2nd to the 5th century, 
then it may be regarded as the twin-sister of the church dogmatic 
which grew up during the same period; the younger sister was 
brought up by the elder, then rebelled against her and at last tyran- 
nized oyer her. The Neoplatonists themselves characterized the 
theologians of the church as intruders, who had appropriated the 
Greek philosophy and spoiled it by the admixture of strange fables. 
Thus Porphyry says of Origen (Euseb. H.E. vi. 19), "The outer 
life of Origen was that of a Christian and contrary to law; but, as 
far as his views of things and of God are concerned, he thought like 
the^ Greeks, whose conceptions he overlaid with foreign myths." 
This verdict of Porphyry's is at all events more just and apt than 
that of the theologians on the Greek philosophers, when they accused 
them of having b6rrowed all their really valuable doctrines from the 
ancient Christian books. But the important pointis that the rela- 
tionship was acknowledged on both sides. Now, in so far as both 
Neoplatonism and the church dogmatic set out from the felt need of 
redemption, in so far as both sought to deliver the soul from sensu- 
ality and recognized man's inability without divine aid — without a 
levclation — to attain salvation and a sure knowledge of the truth, 
they are at once most intimately related and at the same time 



mutually independent. It must be confessed that when Chris- 
tianity began to project a theology it was already deeply impregnated 
by Hellenic influences. But the influence is to be traced not so 
much to philosophy as to the general culture of the time, and the 
whole set of conditions under which spiritual life was manifested. 
When Neoplatonism appeared, the Christian church had already laid 
down the main positions of her theology; or if not, she worked 
them out alongside of Neoplatonism — that is not a mere accident — 
but still independently. It was only by identifying itself with the 
whole history of Greek philosophy, or by figuring as pure Platonism 
restored, that Neoplatonism could stigmatize the church theology 
of Alexandria as a plagiarism from itself. These assumptions, how- 
ever, were fanciful. Although our sources are unfortunately very 
imperfect, the theology of the church does not appear to have learned 
much from Neoplatonism in the 3rd century — partly because the 
latter had not yet reached the form in which its doctrines could 
be accepted by the church dogmatic, and partly because theology 
was otherwise occupied. Her first business was to plant herself 
firmly on her own territory, tonpakc good her position and dear 
away old and objectionable opinions. Origen was quite as inde- 
pendent a thinker as Plotinus; only, they both drew on the same 
tradition. From the 4th century downwards, however, the influence 
of Neoplatonism on the Oriental theologians was of the utmost im- 
portance. The church gradually expressed her most peculiar con- 
victions in dogmas, which were formulated by philosophical methods, 
but were irreconcilable with Neoplatonism (the Christological 
dogmas); and the further this process went the more unrestrainedly 
did theologians resign themselves to the influence of Neoplatonism 
on all other questions. The doctrines of the incarnation, the resur- 
rection of the flesh and the creation of the world in time marked the 
boundary line between the church's dogmatic and Neoplatonism; 
in every other respect, theologians and Ncoplatonists drew so closely 
together that many of them arc completely^ at one. In fact, there 
were special cases, like that of Synesius, in which a speculative 
reconstruction of distinctively Christian doctrines by Christian men 
was winked at. If a book does not happen to touch on any of the 
above-mentioned doctrines, it may often be doubtful whether the 
writer is a Christian or a Neoplatonist. ^ In ethical precepts, in 
directions for right living (that is, asceticism), the two systems 
approximate more and more closely. But it was here that^ Neo- 
platonism finally celebrated its greatest triumph. It indoctrinated 
the church with all its mysticism, its mystic exercises and even its 
magical cultus as taught by Iamblichus. The works of the pseudo- 
Dionysius contain a gnosis in which, by means of the teaching of 
Iamblichus and Proclus, the church's theology is turned _ into a 
scholastic mysticism with directions on matters of practice and 
ritual. And as these writings were attributed to Dionysius, the 
disciple of the apostles, the scholastic mysticism which they unfold 
was regarded as an apostolic, not to say a divine, science. The 
influence; exercised by these writings, first on the East, and then — 
after the 9th (or 12th) century — on the West, cannot be overestima- 
ted. It is impossible to enlarge upon it here; suffice it to say that the . 
mystical and pietistic devotion of our own day, even in the Protestant 
churches, is nourished on works whose ancestry can be traced, 
through a series of intermediate links, to the writings of the pseudo- 
Areopagite. 

In the ancient world there was only one Western theologian who 
came directly under the influence of Neoplatonism ; but that one is 
Augustine, the most important of them all. It was through Neo- 
platonism that Augustine got rid of scepticism and the last dregs of 
Manichaeism. In the seventh book of his Confessions he has recorded 
how much he owed to the perusal of Neoplatonic works. On all the 
cardinal doctrines — God, matter, the relation of God to the world, 
freedom and evil — Augustine retained the impress of Neoplatonism; 
at the same time he is the theologian of antiquity who most clearly 
perceived and most fully stated wherein Neoplatonism and Chris- 
tianity differ. The best ever written by any church father on this 
subject is to be found in chaps, ix.-xxi. of the seventh book of the 
Confessions. 

Why Neoplatonism succumbed in the conflict with Christianity is 
a question which the historians have never satisfactorily answered. 
As a rule, the problem is not even stated correctly. m We have nothing 
to do here with our own private ideal of Christianity, but solely 
with catholic Christianity and catholic theology. These are the forces 
that conquered Neoplatonism, after assimilating nearly everything 
that it contained. Further, we must consider the arena in which 
the victory was won.^ The battlefield was the empire ofConstantine 
and Theodosius. It is only when these and all other circumstances 
of the case are duly realized that wehaye a right to inquire how 
much the essential doctrines of Christianity contributed to the vic- 
tory, and what share must be assigned to the organization of the 
church. 

In medieval theology and philosophy mysticism appears as the 
powerful opponent of rationalistic dogmatism. The empirical 
science of the Renaissance and the two following centuries was itself 
a new development of Platonism and Neoplatonism, as opposed jto 
rationalistic dogmatism, with its contempt for experience. Magic, 
astrology and alchemy — all the outgrowth of Neoplatonism — gave 
the first effectual stimulus to the observation of nature, and conse- 
quently to natural science, and in this way finally extinguished barren

rationalism. Thus in the history of science Neoplatonism has played 
a part and rendered services of which Plotinus or Iamblichus or 
Proclus never dreamt. So true is it that sober history is often 
stranger and mofe capricious than all the marvels of legend and 
romance. . .

NEOPTOLEMUS (also called Pyrrhtjs), in Greek legend, the 
son of Achilles and Deidameia. He was brought up by his 
grandfather Lycomedes in the island of Seyros, and taken to 
Troy in the last year of the war by Odysseus, since Helenus had 
declared that the city could not be captured without the aid of a 
descendant of Aeacus. Neoptolemus was famed for his beauty, 
eloquence and bravery. He was one of the warriors in the 
wooden horse and slew Priam at the sack of Troy (Odyssey, 
xi. 508-526; Aeneid, ii. 527). Apart from these Trojan tales, 
Neoptolemus is a prominent figure in the legends of Epirus and 
of Delphi. He was the ancestor of the Molossian kings, who 
therefore claimed to be of pure Hellenic stock. He was murdered 
at Delphi, where he was buried, and a festival was held in his 
honour every eighth year. 

NEOPYTHAGOREANISM, a Graeco- Alexandrian school of 
philosophy, which became prominent in the 1st century a.d. 
Very little is known about the members of this school, and there 
has been much discussion as to whether the Pythagorean litera- 
ture which was widely published at the time in Alexandria was 
the original work of ist-century writers or merely reproductions 
of and commentaries on the older Pythagorean writings. The 
only well-known members of the school were Apollonius of Tyana 
and MQderatus of Gades. In the previous century Cicero's 
learned friend P. Nigidius Figulus (d. 45 B.C.) had made an 
attempt to revive Pythagorean doctrines, but he cannot be 
described as a member of the school. Further, it is necessary 
to distinguish from the Neopythagoreans a number of Eclectic 
Platonists, who, during the 1st century of our era, maintained 
views which had a similar tendency (e.g. Apuleius of Madaura, 
Plutarch of Chaeronea and, later, Numenius of Apamea). 

Neopythagoreanism was the first product of an age in which 
abstract philosophy had begun to pall. The Stoics discovered 
that their " perfect man " was not to be found in the luxurious, 
often morbid society of the Graeco-Roman world; that some- 
thing more than dialectic ethics was needed to reawaken a 
sense of responsibility. A degenerate society cared nothing for 
syllogisms grown threadbare by repetition. Neopythagoreanism 
was an attempt to introduce a religious element into pagan 
philosophy in place of what had come to be regarded as an arid 
formalism. The founders of the school sought to invest their 
doctrines with the halo of tradition by ascribing them to Pytha- 
goras and Plato, and there is no reason to accuse them of insin- 
cerity. They went back to the later period of Plato's thought, 
the period when Plato endeavoured to combine his doctrine 
of Ideas with the Pythagorean number-theory, and identified 
the Good with the One, the source of the duality of the Infinite 



and the Measured (t6 airapov and irkpas) with the resultant 
scale of realities from the One down to the objects of the material 
world. They emphasized the fundamental distinction between 
the Soul and the Body. God must be worshipped spiritually 
by prayer and the will to be good, not in outward action. The 
soul must be freed from its material surrounding, the " muddy 
vesture of decay," by an ascetic habit of life. Bodily pleasures 
and all sensuous impulses must be abandoned as detrimental 
to the spiritual purity of the soul. God is the principle of good; 
Matter (uXt/) the groundwork of Evil. In this system we dis- 
tinguish not only the asceticism of Pythagoras and the later 
mysticism of Plato, but also the influence of the Orphic mysteries 
and of Oriental philosophy. The Ideas of Plato are no longer 
self-subsistent entities; they are the elements which constitute 
the content of spiritual activity. The Soul is no longer an 
appanage of obala, it is ovala itself: the non-material universe 
is regarded as the sphere of mind or spirit. 

Thus Neopythagoreanism is a link in the chain between the 
old and the new in pagan philosophy. It connects the teaching 
of Plato with the doctrines of Neoplatonism and brings it into 
line with the later Stoicism and with the ascetic system of the 
Essenes. A comparison between the Essenes and the Neo- 
pythagoreans shows a parallel so striking as to warrant the theory 
that the Essenes were profoundly ^influenced by Neopythago- 
reanism. Lastly Neopythagoreanism furnished Neoplatonism 
with the weapons with which pagan philosophy made its last 
stand against Christianity. 

See Pythagoras, Neoplatonism, Essenes; and Zeller's Philo- 
sophie d. Griechen. For members of the school see Apollonius of 
Tyana and Moderatus of Gades. 

NEPAL, Nepaul or Nipal, an independent state, situated on 
the north-eastern frontier of India, lying between 8o° 15' and 
88° 10' E., and 26 20' and 30 10' N.; area, 54,000 sq. m. Its 
extreme length is about 525 m., and its breadth varies from 90 
to 140 m. It is bounded on the N. by Tibet; on the E. by 
Sikkim; on the S. by Bengal and the United Provinces; and 
on the W. by Kumaon, from which it is separated by the Kali 
river. Its population is estimated by the natives at about 
5,200,000, the common phrase used by the rulers in speaking 
of popular opinion being, " but what will the Bawan (i.e. fifty- 
two) Lakh say to this." 

Nepal consists physically of two distinct territories: (1) the 
tarai, or strip of level, cultivated and forest land lying along the 
southern border; and (2) the great mountainous tract stretching 
northwards to Tibet. Along the northern frontier stand many of 
the highest peaks of the Himalayan range, such as Dhaulagiri 
(26,837 ft.), Mutsiputra, Gaurishankar and Yasa (24,000), Gosain 
Than (26,313), Mount Everest (29,002 accordingto the survey value), 
Kinchinjunga (28,146), and numerous peaks varying from 20,000 
to 24,000 ft. In clear weather this magnificent snowy range may be 
seen in an almost continuous line from the top of some of the lower 
ranges near Katmandu. South of these are numerous parallel lower 
ranges, varying from 16,000 to 6000 ft. in height, which are broken 
up at intervals by cross ranges, thus forming a series of glens with a 
few hill-girt valleys interspersed. 

These mountain ranges determine the course of the rivers, which 
are divided by the cross ranges into four groups. The first of these 
extends from Kumaon eastward as far as Dhaulagiri, and consists 
of the affluents of the Kali (Sarda), Sarju, Kurnah, Eastern Sarju, 
and Rapti, all of which ultimately form the Gogra or Gogari, and 
flow into the Ganges. The second group, known to the Nepalese 
as the Sapt Gandaki, rises from the peaks between Dhaulagiri and 
Gosain Than, and unite at Trebeni Ghat to form the Gandak. 
The third is a group of smaller rivers draining the great valley of 
Nepal, the valleys of Chitlong, Benepa, and Panouti, and portions 
of the tarai around the Chunaghati range of hills. These are the 
various branches of the Bara Gandak, the lesser Rapti, the Bagmati 
and Kumla. East of this again is the fourth group, known to the 
Nepalese as the Sapt Kosi, rising from the peaks between^ Gosain 
Than and Kinchinjunga, and uniting to form the Soon Kosi, which 
falls into the Ganges. 

There is thus a natural division of the country into four portions. 
The most western is the country of the Baisi (or twenty-two) rajas, 
and contains the towns of Jumla, Doti and Sulliana. The second 
is the country of the Chaubisi (or twenty-four) rajas, and contains 
the towns of Malebum, Palpa, Gurkha and Noakote. The third is 
the district containing Nepal proper, with the capital and many 
large towns to be mentioned aftenvards. The fourth is the eastern 
portion of Nepal, comprising the country of the Kiratis, and many 
small towns, such as Dhankota, Ilam and Bijapur.

Route into Nepal — The portion of Nepal, exclusive of the tarai, 
which is open to Europeans is the " valley of Nepal," containing 
the capital of the country, and a few adjacent smaller valleys. 
There is only one means of access open to Europeans, and this 
indeed is in general resorted to by the natives, as the other 
routes to the capital are longer and far more difficult. The 
road runs nearly north from Segauli, passing through the tarai 
and sal forests, to Bhichhkhori; then through the beds of mountain 
streams, through a pass in the Churiyaghati range, and through 
another sal forest, to Hetoura; thence by a wide and good road to 
Bhimphedi at the foot of the Sisaghari range of hills. So far the 
route is practicable for carts and baggage animals, but from this 
point the road is a mere rugged footpath over the Sisaghari Pass, 
through the Chitlong valley and over the Chandragiri range. The 
distance from Segauli to Katmandu is 90 m. 

The valley in extreme length from east to west is about 26 m., 
and in breadth from north to south about 15. The surrounding 
hills vary in height from 6000 to 9720 ft., the level of the valley 
itself being about 4500 ft. above the sea. Tradition has it that 
Nepal was once a lake, and appearances are in favour of this view. 
It is crossed from east to west by a low limestone range, through 
which the waters have gradually forced a passage, and in like manner 
the collected rivers have escaped at the south-east corner of the 
valley. 

There are three principal streams, the Bagmati, Vishnumati, and 
Manohora, besides many small tributaries of these. All the rivers 
rise within the valley, except the Bagmati, which springs from the 
northern side of the Shiupuri peak, and enters the valley through a 
ravine at the north-east corner. They all unite and pass^ through 
a long narrow gorge In the limestone range, already mentioned, at 
Chobhar, and ultimately escape from the valley at Kotwaldar. 

Climate. — In and around the Nepal valley, as in India, the year 
may be divided into the rainy, cold and hot seasons. The rains 
begin in June and last till October, but the fall is not so heavy or 
continuous as in the plains of Hindustan. The cold season extends 
from the middle of October to the middle of April.^ During these 
months the climate is delicious. Hoar-frost and thin ice are common 
in the mornings, and the thermometer sometimes falls as low as 25 
Fahr., but the days arc bright and warm. From Christmas to the 
end of February there are occasional showers of rain ; and snow 
falls on the surrounding low ranges, but is very rarely seen in the 
valley itself. From April to the beginning of the rains is the hot 
season, but the thermometer seldom reaches 85 in the shade. The 
result of observations extending over many years gives an average 
mean temperature of 6o° Fahr., and an annual rainfall of about 
60 in. Violent thunderstorms are not uncommon, and occasionally 
severe earthquakes occur, as in 1833 and 1866. 

Flora and Fauna. — In a country possessing such a range of 
altitudes the flora and fauna are of course very varied. For descrip- 
tive purposes, Nepal may again be divided into three zones. These 
are — (1) the tarai and lower ranges of hills up to 4000 ft. in height; 

(2) the central ranges and high-lying valleys, up to 10,000 ft.; and 

(3) the alpine region, from 10,000 to 29,000 ft. in height. These 
zones are not, however, sharply defined, as the climate varies 
according to the latitude, the height of intermediate ranges, and the 
depth of the valleys; so that tropical plants and animals arc some- 
times found far in the interior, and the more northern species descend 
along the loftier spurs into the southern zones. 

The low alluvial land of the tarai is well adapted for cultivation, 
and is, so to speak, the granary of Nepal; but owing to scantiness 
of population and other causes the greater portion of it consists of 
swamps, jungles and forests. Considerable stretches of land arc, 
however, being reclaimed from year to year. The productions here 
are those of British India — cotton, rice, wheat, pulse, sugar-cane, 
tobacco, opium, indigo, and the fruits and vegetables familiar in 
the plains of India. The forests yield a magnificent supply of sal, 
sisu.and other valuable forest trees; and the jungles abound with 
acacias, mimosas, cotton tree (Bombax), dak (Butea frondosa), large 
bamboos, rattans, palms, and numerous ferns and orchids. On the 
Churiaghati range the common Finns longifolia grows freely. Tea 
can be grown at a height of from 2000 to 4000 ft. The middle zone 
supplies rice, wheat, maize, barley, oats, ginger, turmeric, chillies, 
potatoes, Cueurbitaceac, pineapples, and many varieties of European 
fruits, vegetables and flowers. The forests contain tree rhododen- 
drons, Pinus longifolia, oaks, horse-chestnuts, walnuts, maples, hill 
bamboos, wild cherry, pear, allies of the tea plant, paper plants 
(Daphne), roses, and many other inhabitants of temperate climes, 
wkh various orchids, ferns and wild flowers. In the alpine zone 
exist Coniferac of many kinds, junipers, yew, box, hollies, birch, 
dwarf rhododendrons and the usual alpine flora. 

The wild animals follow a similar distribution, and the following 
typical species may be mentioned. In the lowest zone are found the 
tiger, leopard, wolf, hyena and jackal, the elephant and rhinoceros, 
the gaur (Gavaeus gaurus), gayal (Gavaeus frontalis), wild buffalo or 
arna, many species of deer, and the black bear {Ursus labiatus). 
Among the birds arc found the pea-fowl, francolins, wild jungle 
fowl, and the smaller vultures, &c. In the middle zone there are the 
leopard, the Himalayan black bear (Ursus tibetanus), the wild dog, 
cats of many sorts, squirrels, hares, porcupines, the pangolin, and 
some species of deer and antelope. Among the birds are the larger 



vultures and eagles, pheasants (Gallophasis) , chukor, hill partridges, 
&c. In the alpine zone are found the true bear (Ursus isabellinus, 
or brown bear), the yak, musk deer, wild goats and sheep, marmots, 
&c. Among the birds are the eagle- vulture (Gypaetus), the blood 
pheasant (Jtfiaginis cruentus), snow pheasant (Tetraogallus hima- 
layensis), snow partridge (Lerwa nivicola), the horned pheasant 
(Ceriornis saiyra), crested pheasant (Catrens wallichi). &c. Geese, 
ducks, waders of all sorts, and other migratory birds are found in 
abundance in the two lower zones. 

Minerals. — The lowest zone in some directions abounds in fossils; 
and deposits of lignite, and even of true coal, arc met with, the 
latter notably at a spot south of Palpa. The middle zone is rich in 
limestone and marbles, and abounds with minerals, such as iron, 
copper, zinc, lead and sulphur. Copper is found near the surface 
in many places, and there are remains of mines both at Markhu and 
in the great valley of Nepal. Mineral springs, both hot and cold, are 
numerous. Traces of silver, and also of gold, have been found in 
the alpine zone. 

People. — The races occupying Nepal are of mixed Mongol 
origin. To the north, inhabiting the higher mountains and 
valleys, dwell the Bhutias or Tibetans. To the west lie the 
Gurungs and Magars. The Murmis, Gurkhalis and Newars 
occupy the central parts; and the Kiratis, Limbus and Lepchas 
occupy the eastern districts. There are also Brahmans and 
Chhatris in the hills. Besides these there are many small tribes 
residing in the tarai and some other malarious districts, known 
as Kumhas, Tharus, Manjis, &c, but generally classed together 
by the Nepalese as Aoulias, or dwellers in the malarious or aoul 
districts. These are probable descendants of immigrants from 
the lower castes of Hindus, occupying the borderlands of the 
tarai. Among the forests of the lower eastern region are also 
to be found some small savage tribes, known as Cbepangs and 
Kusundas. 

All the races except the Aoulias are of a decidedly Mongolian 
appearance, being generally short and robust, and having fiat 
faces, oblique eyes, yellow complexions, straight black hair, 
and comparatively hairless faces. The Newars, according to 
the Vamqavali or native history, trace their descent from the 
races of southern India, but this is rendered more than doubtful 
by both their appearance and language. The Gurkhalis (Gurkhas 
or Ghurkhas) are descendants of the Brahmans and Rajputs who 
were driven out of Hindostan by the Moslems, and took refuge in 
the western hilly lands, where they ultimately became dominant, 
and where they have become much mixed with the other races 
by intermarriage. 

Religions. — The Bhutias, Newars, Limbus, Keratis, and Lepchas 
are all Buddhists, but their religion has become so mixed up with 
Hinduism that it is now hardly recognizable. The Newars have 
entirely abandoned the monastic institutions of Buddhism, and 
have in great measure adopted the rules of caste, though even these 
sit but lightly upon them. They burn their dead, cat the flesh of 
buffaloes, goats, sheep, ducks, and fowls, and drink beer and spirits. 
The Gurkhalis, Magars, and Gurungs arc Hindus, but the last two 
arc by no means strict in the observance of their religion, though 
there are some peculiarities which they carefully preserve. Thus, 
for instance, the Magars will eat pork but not buffalo's flesh, whereas 
the Gurungs cat the buffalo but not the hog. 

Priests. — Where temples are so numerous (there are 2733 shrines 
in the valley) priests naturally abound, both of the Hindu and 
Buddhist religions. The festivals too are many in number, and in 
consequence holidays arc incessant. The raj guru, or high priest, is 
an influential person in the state, a member of council, and has a 
large income from government lands as well as from the fines for 
offences against caste, &e. Many other priests, gurus and purohits, 
have lands assigned to them, and most of the temples have been 
richly endowed by their founders. Every family of rank has a 
special priest, whose office is hereditary. 

Astrologers are also numerous, and their services are in constant 
request. One cannot build a house, set out on a journey, com- 
mence a war, or even take a dose of physic, without having an 
auspicious moment selected for him. 

Languages. — The various races have all separate languages, or 
at least dialects. The Gurkhalis and western tribes use Khas (see 
Pahari), which, unlike the other dialects, is of Sanskrit origin. The 
Newars have a distinct language and alphabets, for there are three 
known to their pandits, though only one is in use now. Their 
language, called Gubhajius, greatly resembles Tibetan, but is now 
interspersed with many Sanskrit words. The Bhutias use the 
Tibetan language and alphabet. 

Education. — There is a central educational institution at Kat- 
mandu with sixteen branches, or schools, over the valley of Nepal. 
This central institution has three departments, English, Sanskrit 
and Persian — or more correctly perhaps Urdu. Education is provided 



3 8o 



NEPAL 



free by the state, and is encouraged by grants of scholarships 
and prizes. Boys passing out well are sent at government expense 
to the various universities of northern India to complete their 
education, and some have lately been sent to Japan. The evil 
effects of higher education, as taught in the Indian colleges, on the 
youth of Bengal, &c, has, however, given the Gurkha durbar a 
distinct shock, and it seems not unlikely that education in Nepal 
may receive a set-back in consequence. Some of the upper classes 
speak English fluently, but the bulk of the labouring classes is quite 
illiterate. 

Katmandu is a perfect storehouse of ancient Sanskrit literature, 
and some of the oldest MSS. in that language as yet known to 
scholars have been found there. There is also a fair English library. 
Both are lodged in a good building. 

Calendar. — There are three principal eras in use in Nepal. The 
;Samvat of Vikramaditya begins fifty-seven years before the Christian 
"era, the Saka era of Salivanhn begins seventy-eight years after 
the Christian era, and the Nepalese Sam vat dates from October a.d. 
880. The Sri-Harsha and Kaligat eras are also sometimes used. 
Day is considered to begin when the tiles on a house can be counted, 
or when the hairs on the back of a man's hand can be discerned 
against the sky. Sixty bipalas = i pala; 60 palas = i ghari or 
24 minutes ; 60 gharis = 1 day of 24 hours. 

Health. — All families of good position have at least one bai<L % or 
medical man, in constant attendance, and there are also many 
general practitioners. There is a large central hospital at Katmandu, 
and some thirteen other smaller hospitals are distributed over the 
country, with free beds, and provision for outdoor treatment. 
There is also a small hospital attached to the British Residency. 
The diseases most prevalent in the country are rheumatism, chronic 
dyspepsia, skin diseases, syphilis, goitre, smallpox, cholera and 
leprosy. In the rains a number of cases of mild intermittent fever, 
diarrhoea, and dysentery are met with. Fever of a severe typhoid 
type is common in the crowded lanes and dirty villages. Vaccination 
is being gradually introduced into the country, and the general 
health of the inhabitants of the principal cities in the valley has 
greatly improved since the introduction of fresh water, which has 
been brought in by pipes from mountain springs. 

Towns. — There are three large towns in the Nepal valley, Kat- 
mandu, the capital, said to contain approximately 50,000 inhabitants, 
Patan and Bhatgaon about 30,000 each. The houses are from two to 
four storeys ?.n height, built of brick and tiled. The windows and 
balconies are of wood, arid some are elaborately carved. There 
are numerous handsome temples in all the towns, the majority of 
which are pagoda-shaped and built of brick, with roofs of copper, 
which is sometimes gilt. The streets are narrow, and they, as well 
as the squares, are all paved with brick or stone. In front of the 
temples generally stand monoliths surmounted by figures of Garuda, 
or of the founder, made of brass gilt, or sometimes of black stone. 
Besides these three large towns, there are at least twenty smaller 
towns and numerous villages in the valley, ail of which possess 
many temples. Some of these, as for instance those of Pasnupati, 
Bodhnatha and Symbhunatha, are considered of great sanctity. 
Many thousands of pilgrims come at one festival to worship at 
Pashupati, and it is there that the dying are brought to be immersed 
in the Bagmati, and the dead are burned on its banks. 

Agriculture. — While the Gurkhalis are occupied in military affairs, 
the agriculture of the valley is carried on by the Newars. The 
soil is varied in character, from light micaceous sand to dense 
ferruginous clay. The whole valley is cultivated and irrigated 
where practicable, and the slopes of the hills are carefully terraced, 
so that there is little grazing ground, and few sheep or cattle are 
kept. There are some milch cows and buffaloes, which are either 
stall-fed or grazed in the jungles at the foot of the hills. Animals 
for consumption and sacrifice are all imported, and are consumed 
as fast as they are brought in. In the cold season the Bhutias bring 
large flocks of sheep and goats laden with bags of borax, salt and 
saltpetre. These are sold for consumption, except a few tnat are 
retained to carry back the bags. These droves are generally accom- 
panied by ponies and some of the large Tibetan dogs; the latter are 
powerful, fierce, shaggy animals, about the size of a small Newfound- 
land dog. Poultry are kept and used by the Newars, especially 
ducks, the eggs of which are in great demand even among the 
orthodox Hindus. The crops grown in the valley consist of rice, 
both the transplanted and the dry-sown or ghaiya varieties, wheat, 
pulse, murwah, maize, buckwheat, chillies, radishes, mustard, 
garlic, onions, ginger, turmeric, sugar-cane, potatoes, ground nuts, 
many species of cucumbers and pumpkins, &c. Nothing but 
articles of food are allowed to be grown in the valley; hence its 
capabilities for producing tea, cotton and tobacco are unknown. 
All of these, however, are grown in other parts of the country, both 
t in the hills and the tarai. Large cardamoms are extensively grown 
in the eastern hills, and form an important article of export. The 
hemp plant {Cannabis indica) grows wild, and is used both for manu- 
facturing purposes and for producing the resinous extract and other 
intoxicating products which are exported. Plants producing dyes, 
such as madder or maniit, arc grown in some places; and drugs, 
such as chirata, are collected and exported. The better class of 
soils yields a return of about Rs. 180 per khait, and the poorest 
about Rs. 90 per khait. Erom some of the finer soils as many as 



three crops of various sorts are obtained annually. The land- 
measures in use are different in different parts of the country. 
Thus, in the eastern tarai a bigha measures 90X90 yds. English, 
while in the western tarai it is only 15X15 yds. In the hills the 
unit cf land measurement is called ropni, which is about twice the 
size of a western tarai bigha— and twenty-five ropnis make one 
khait. This measurement applies only to rice lands. Other land 
measurements for the valley are as follows : One Nepali bigha is 
90 yds.X 90 yds. British. (A British Indian bigha is 40 yds.X 40 
yds. and 3 Nepali bighas equal about 5 acres.) Sixteen ropnis 
equal 1 Nepali bigha. 

Land Taxes. — The tarai lands pay from two to nine rupees 
(British) per Nepali bigha according to quality of land. In the hills 
taxes are charged on the plough, thus: one plough pays 13 annas; 
one bullock without plough about 10 annas; one spade 6 J annas. 
These taxes are termed Hal, Patay and Kodaley. 

Horticulture. — The Newars are also fond of horticulture. Many 
European fruits, flowers and vegetables have been introduced 
and grow freely. The country is famous for its oranges and pine- 
apples. Elowers are grown and sold for religious purposes, and even 
wild flowers are brought into the market and much used by the 
Newar women in adorning their hair, as well as for offerings at 
the shrines. Many wild fruits are collected and sold in the 
markets. Apples and pears, of English stock, thrive well; apricots 
and plums are good; peaches and grapes grow freely and are 
of large size, but they seldom ripen before the rains begin, when 
they rot. 

Trade. — All the trade and manufactures of the country are in 
the hands of the Newars, and a few Kashmiris and natives of Hindu- 
stan. The trade in European goods is chiefly carried on by the 
latter, whilst the Newars deal in corn, oil, salt, tobacco and articles 
of domestic manufacture. The trade with India is carried on at 
numerous marts along the frontier, at each of which a customs 
station is established, and the taxes are collected by a thikadar 
or farmer. The Newars also carry on the trade with Tibet, through 
a colony which has been for many years established at Lhasa, but 
this trade has been a shrinking item since the opening of the Lhasa- 
Darjeeling route. There are two principal routes to Tibet. One of 
these runs north-east from Katmandu to the frontier-station of 
Kuti or Nilam, crossing the Himalayan range at a height of 14,000 ft. ; 
the other passes out of the valley at the north-west corner, and 
runs at first upwards along the main branch of the Gandak, crossing 
the Himalayas, near Kerung, at a height of 9000 ft. All goods on 
these routes are carried on men's backs, except the salt, &c, carried 
in bags by the Bhutia sheep and goats. The principal imports from 
Hindustan are raw cotton, cotton goods, woollen goods, silks and 
velvets, hardware, cutlery, beads, jewels, coral, saddlery, shoes, 
guns, gunpowder, glassware, vermilion, indigo, lac, tea, betel-nut, 
spices, paper, sugar, tobacco, oils, sheet copper, goats, cattle, 
buffaloes; and from Tibet, musk, medicines, yaks tails, tea, woollen 
cloth, blankets, borax, salt, saltpetre, paper-plant, honey, wax, 
sheep, goats, yaks, ponies, silver, gold. The exports to Hindustan 
include wax, paper-plant, music, yaks' tails, medicines, cardamoms, 
borax, sulphate of copper, brass pots, iron pots, ponies, elephants, 
hawks, hides and horns (buffalo), rice, ghee, oil seeds, red chillies, 
madder, cobalt, potatoes, oranges; and to Tibet, broad cloth, raw 
cotton, cotton goods, tobacco, sugar, opium, coral, jewels, pearls, 
spices, betel-nut, copper pots, iron pots and hardware. The 
Nepalese are utterly regardless of statistics, but recent estimates 
value the exports and imports to and from the British provinces 
at 3 million sterling annually. Duties are levied on exports and 
imports, which will be noticed under the head of revenue. 

Manufactures. — The Newars are skilful workmen. Their bricks 
are excellent, and so also is their pottery, for which certain towns 
are famous, such as Themi and Noakote. As carpenters they excel, 
though the use of the large saw is still unknown, and planks are cut 
with chisel and mallet. Some of the wood carvings on the temples 
and large houses are most artistic in design and bold in execution, 
though unfortunately they are sometimes of a most obscene char- 
acter. The manufactures are few, consisting chiefly of coarse 
cotton cloths, paper made of the inner bark of the paper-plants 
(Daphne), bells, brass and iron utensils, weapons, and ornaments 
of gold and silver. 

Coinage. — At one time Nepal supplied Tibet with its silver coinage, 
but this was abandoned on account of the adulterations introduced 
by the Nepalese. The ancient coins, specimens of which are still to 
be met with, were made by hand. The modern coinage is struck by 
machinery, a regular mint having been established by Sir Jung 
Bahadur at Katmandu, and since improved by his successors. 

Government. — The Nepalese have relations with China, and 
occasionally send an embassy with presents to Peking. The 
British too have considerable influence with the government 
in regard to their foreign relations, and a British resident is 
stationed at Katmandu. But in all matters of domestic policy 
the Nepalese brook no interference, and they are most jealous 
of anything that has a tendency to encroach on their inde- 
pendence. Theoretically the government of Nepal is a pure 
despotism, and the maharajah is paramount. Practically, all 



NEPAL 



381 



real power has long been in the hands of the prime minister, 
and mueh of the modern history of the country consists of 
accounts of the struggles of the various factions for power. 
Under the prime minister there is a council, consisting of the 
relations of the king, the raj guru, the generals, and a few other 
officials known as kajis and sirdars and bhardars, which is con- 
sulted on all important business, and which forms a court of 
appeal for disputed cases from the courts of law. There arc 
separate civil and criminal courts, but the distinction is not 
always observed, as difficult cases are often transferred from 
one to the other. 

Law and Justice. — The old savage legal code with its ordeals by 
fire and water, and its punishments by mutilation and torture was 
abolished by Sir Jung Bahadur after his return from England in 
1 85 1. Treason, rebellion and desertion in war-time are punished 
by death. Bribery and peculation by public^ servants are punished 
by dismissal from office, and a fine and imprisonment, the latter of 
which can be commuted by payments at various rates, according 
to the nature of the offence. Murder and the killing of cows arc 
capital offences. Manslaughter and maiming cows are punished by 
imprisonment for life and other offences against the person or 
property by imprisonment or fine. Brahmans and women are 
exempted from capital punishment. Offences against caste are 
heavily punished by fine and imprisonment. In some cases indeed 
all the offender's property is confiscated, and he and his family may 
be sold as slaves. Bankruptcy laws have been recently introduced. 
The marriage laws are somewhat peculiar. Among the Gurkhas 
the laws resemble those of other Hindus as regards the marriage of 
widows, polygamy &c , but among the Newars every girl while still 
an infant is married with much ceremony to a bel fruit, which is 
then thrown into some sacred stream. . As the fate of the fruit is 
unknown, a Newari is supposed never to become a widow. At the 
age of puberty a husband is selected, but the woman can at any 
moment divorce herself by placing a betel-nut under her husband's 
pillow and taking her departure Adultery is punished by the im- 
prisonment and fine of both the adulteress and her paramour. Sati 
has been abolished in Nepal by law- 

Gaols. — There are three large prisons in the Nepal valley, one 
for males and two for females; there are also a considerablenumber 
of gaols throughout the country. The prisoners are kept in irons, 
and employed in public works of various sorts. They are allowed 
six pice a day for subsistence at the capital, and five pice in other 
places. Their relatives are allowed, to minister to their creature 
comforts. 

Slavery is an institution of the country, and all families of rank 
possess many slaves, who are employed in domestic and field work. 
They are generally treated well, and are carefully protected by law. 
The price of slaves ranges from Rs. 100 to Rs. 200. 

Revenue. — The revenue of Nepal is about one hundredand fifty 
lakhs of rupees, i.e. £10,000,000. The chief sources of it are the 
land-tax, customs, mines, forests and monopolies. About 10% 
of the tarai lands, and 20% of the hil! lands, are private property. 
Some lands were assigned by the Gurkhali rajas to Brahmans, 
soldiers and others, and these are untaxed. Others, which were 
the gifts of the old Newar kings, pay from 4 to 8 annas per bigha. 
All such grants of land, however, are subject to a heavy fine on the 
coronation of a new raja. Land which does not produce rice is 
lightly taxed, but in the valley of Nepal, and wherever rice is grown, 
the government tax or rent is one half of the produce of the land. 
Waste lands, when brought into cultivation, are rent free for ten 
years, after which for five years the tax is only 4 annas per bigha, 
and the cultivator receives one- tenth of the cleared land rent free 
for his life. A considerable revenue in the shape of royalty is 
obtained from mines of copper, iron ? &c- The taxes on merchandise 
amount to from 12 to 14% on the value of the goods carried to and 
from British India, and from 5 to 6% is charged on goods exported 
to Tibet. 

Army. — Much attention is devoted by the purkhalis to military 
matters and the bulic of that race may be said to be soldiers. The 
standing army consists of about 50,000 men. in affair state of effici- 
ency. Besides this force there is a reserve, consisting of men who 
have served for a few years and taken their discharge, but in case 
of necessity can be called on again to enter the ranks. These would 
probably raise the strength to between 70.000 and 80,000 men. 
The regiments are formed on the European system, and similarly 
drilled and officered. Each man carries in addition to a bayonet a 
kukri or native knife There is practically no cavalry, as the country 
is not suited for horses. The artillery, however, is on a larger scale, 
and consists nearly entirely of batteries of mountain artillery. 
There is a large arsenal well provided with supplies of gunpowder 
and military stores There are workshops where cannon are cast, 
and rifles and ammunition of all sorts turned out in large quantities, 
but of an indifferent quality* 

In addition to its own army, Nepal supplies to the British army in 
India a large force of- splendid soldiers, who were raised under the 
following circumstances. In 18 15 the British enlisted three battalions 



of Gurkhas from amongst the soldiers of that race who were thrown 
out of employment, owing 10 the termination of the first phase of 
the war with Nepal. These regiments were styled the 1st. 2nd 
and 3rd Gurkhas, and were soon employed on active service. The 
1st and 2nd behaved with much gallantry at the siege and storming 
of Bharatpur, and in the First Sikh War, while the 2nd and 3rd 
won a great name for loyalty and courage during the Mutiny of 1857- 
58, especially at the siege of Delhi. This induced the British to 
raise, in 1858, two more battalions, which they numbered the 4th 
and 5th, and the whole Gurkha force has since proved its usefulness 
and loyalty on many occasions, particularly during the Afghan War 
of 1878-80, and on many frontier expeditions. Battalions have also 
been sent^ on service to Burma, Egypt, China and Tibet. The 
Gurkhas in the British service now consist of ten regiments of 
riflemen of two battalions each, and number about 20,000 men. 

History. — Nepal and the somewhat similar country of Kashmir 
are peculiar among the Hindu states of India in possessing an 
historical literature. The Nepalese VantQdvalt professes to start 
from a very early period in the Satya Yuga, when the present 
valley was still a lake. The earlier portion of it is devoted to 
the Satya and Treta Yugas, and contains mythological tales 
and traditions having reference to various sacred localities 
in the country. During these two Yugas, and also the Dwapur 
Yuga, the VantQdvalt deals in round numbers of thousands of 
years. 

In the beginning of the Kali Yuga, the Gupta dynasty is said 
to have been founded by Ne-Muni, from whom the country takes 
its name of Nepal. Lists are then given of the various dynasties, 
with the lengths of the reigns of the rajas. The dynasties 
mentioned are the Gupta, Ahir, Kirati, Somavanshi, Suryavanshi, 
Thakuri or first Rajput, Vaishya Thakuri, second Rajput and 
Karnataki dynasties. The country was then invaded by Mukun- 
dasena, and after his expulsion various Vaishya Thakuri dynasties 
are said to have held the throne for a period of 225 years. The 
chronology of the VamQdvalt up to this period is very confused 
and inaccurate; and, though the accounts of the various 
invasions and internal struggles, mixed up as they are with 
grotesque legends and tales, may be interesting and amusing, 
they can hardly be considered authentic. Some of the names of 
the rajas, and the dates of their reigns, have been determined 
by coins, the colophons of old MSS., and certain inscriptions 
on the temples and ancient buildings. For instance, Ancuvarma, 
of the Thakuri dynasty, reigned about a.d. 633, as he is men- 
tioned by the Chinese traveller Hsuan Tsang, who visited Nepal. 
His name too is found in an inscription still extant. In like 
manner it is ascertained from MSS. that Rudra-deva-Varma 
was reigning in 1008; Lakshmikama-deva from 1015 to 1040; 
Padma-deva, of the Vaishya Thakuri dynasty, in 1065; Mana- 
deva, of the second Rajput dynasty, in 1139; Ananta-Malla, 
1286-1302; Harisinha-deva, 1324; Jayastithi-Malla, 1385-1391. 
Much information as to the chronology of the various dynasties 
can be obtained from the catalogue of the Cambridge MSS. com- 
piled by Cecil Bendall, and also from his papers on the ancient 
coins of the country. Inscriptions too have been edited by 
Professor Biihler in the Indian Antiquary, vol. ix. Detailed 
lists of the rajas are to be found in Kirkpatrick's Account of 
Nepal f in Hodgson's Essays t Prinsep's papers in the Asiatic 
Society s Journal and Wright's History of Nepal. 

The records begin to be more accurate from the time of the 
invasion and conquest of the country by Harisinha-deva, the 
raja of Simraun, 1324. This raja was driven from Simraun 
by Tughlak Shah of Delhi, but seems to have found little difficulty 
in the conquest of Nepal. There were only four rajas of this 
Ayodhya dynasty, and then the throne was occupied by Jaya- 
bhadra-Malla, a descendant of Abhaya-Malla, one of the Rajput 
dynasty, who reigned in the 13th century* There were eight 
rajas of this dynasty. The seventh, Jayastithi-Malla, who 
reigned for forty-three years (1386-14 29), appears to have done 
much in forming codes of laws, and.introducing caste and its rules 
among the Newars. In the reign of the eighth raja, Yaksha- 
Malla, the kingdom was divided into four separate states — 
namely, Banepa, Bhatgaon or Bhaktapur, Kantipur or Kat- 
mandu, and Lalitapur or Patan. There was only one raja of 
Banepa, who died without issue. The Malla dynasty in the other 



3*82 NEPAL 

three branches continued in power up to the conquest of the 
country by the Gurkhas in 1768. 

The Gurkhas claim descent from the Rajputs of Chitor, in 
Rajputana. They were driven out of their own country by 
the victorious Moslems, and took refuge in the hilly districts 
about Kumaon, whence they gradually pushed their way east- 
wards to Lamjung, Gurkha, Noakote and ultimately to the 
valley of Nepal, which under RajaPrithwiNarayana they finally 
captured. In the struggle which took place at Bhatgaon, Jaya- 
prakasa (the raja of Katmandu) was wounded, and shortly 
afterwards he died at Pashupati. Ranjit-Malla, the aged raja 
of Bhatgaon, was allowed to retire to Benares, where he ended 
his days. Tej Narsinha, the raja of Patan, was kept in confine- 
ment till his death. During the latter years of the war Jaya- 
prakasa applied to the British for assistance, and a small force, 
under Captain Kinloch, was sent into the tarai in 1765, but it was 
repulsed by the Gurkhas. 

Prithwi Narayana died in 1774. He left two sons, Pratapa- 
sinha Sah and Bahadur Sah. The former succeeded his father, 
but died in 1777, leaving an infant son, Rana Bahadur Sah. On 
the death of Pratapa-sinha, his brother, who had been in exile, 
returned to Nepal and became regent. The mother of the infant 
king, however, was opposed to him, and he had again to flee to 
Bettia, in British territory, where he remained till the death of 
the rani, when he again became regent, and continued so till 1795. 
During this time the Gurkhas were busily annexing all the 
neighbouring petty states, so that in 1790 their territories 
extended from Bhutan to the Sutlej river, and from Tibet to the 
British provinces. At length, in 1790, they invaded Tibet, and 
were at first successful; but they were thus brought into contact 
with the Chinese, who in 1791 sent a large force to invade Nepal. 
In 1792 the Chinese advanced as far as Noakote, and there 
dictated terms to the Nepalese. 

In 1791 the Gurkhas had entered into a commercial treaty with 
the British and hence, when hard pressed, they applied for 
assistance against the Chinese to Lord Cornwallis. In con- 
sequence of this Kirkpatrick was despatched to Nepal, and 
reached Noakote in the spring of 1792, but not till after peace had 
been concluded. One result of this embassy was the ratification 
of another commercial treaty on the 1st of March 1792. 

In 1795 Rana Bahadur removed his uncle, Bahadur Sah, from 
the regency, and two years subsequently put him to death. 
From this time up to 1799 the king, who seems to have been 
insane, perpetrated the most barbarous outrages, till at length 
his conduct became so intolerable that he was forced to abdicate 
in favour of his son, Girvan-yuddha VikramaSah, who was still 
an infant. Rana Bahadur once again recovered the throne in 
1804, but was assassinated in 1805. 

In October 1801 another treaty was signed by the British and 
Nepalese authorities, and a British resident was sent to the 
Nepalese court, but was withdrawn in 1803, owing to the conduct 
of the Nepalese. From this time the Nepalese carried on a 
system of encroachment and outrage on the frontier, which led 
to a declaration of war by the British in November 1814. At first 
the British attacks were directed against the western portion of 
the Nepalese territory, and under Generals Marly, Wood and 
Gillespie several disasters were met with. General Gillespie 
himself was killed while leading an assault on a small fort called 
Kalunga. General Ochterlony was more successful, and the 
Gurkhas were driven eastward beyond the Kali river, and began 
to negotiate for peace. Arms, however, were soon taken up again, 
and Ochterlony, who was put in command, in January 1816, 
advanced directly on the capital in the line of the route that is 
now in use. He soon fought his way as far as Mukwanpur, and 
the Nepalese sued for peace. A treaty was concluded in March, 
by which the Nepalese relinquished much of their newly acquired 
territory, and agreed to allow a British residency to be estab- 
lished at Katmandu. In November the raja died, and was 
succeeded by his infant son, Surendra Bikran Sah, the reins of 
government being held by General BhimsenaThapa. 

From this time the records for many years furnish little of 
interest except a history of struggles for office between the Thapa 



and Pandry factions, and futile attempts at forming combinations 
with other states in Hindustan against the British. 

In 1839 Bhimsena's enemies succeeded in driving him from 
power, and he committed suicide, or was murdered, in prison. 
The Kala Pandry faction then came into power, and there were 
frequent grave disputes with the British. War, however, was 
averted by the exertions of the resident, Mr Brian Hodgson. 

In 1843 Matabar Singh, the nephew of Bhimsena, returned 
from exile, soon got into favour at court, and speedily effected 
the destruction of his old enemies the Kala Pandrys, who were 
seized and executed in May 1843. At this time mention begins 
to be made of a nephew of Matabar Singh, Jung Bahadur, the 
eldest of a band of seven brothers, sons of a kaji or state official. 
He rose rapidly in the army and in favour at the court, especially 
with one of the ranis, who was of a most intriguing disposition. 
In 1844 he was a colonel, and on the 18th of May 1845 killed his 
uncle, and immediately, with the aid of the rani, took a prominent 
part in the government. After a short but turbulent interval of 
intrigue, he got rid of his enemies at one fell swoop, by what is 
known as the Kot massacre, on the 15th of September 1846. 
From that time till the day of his death Jung Bahadur was in 
reality the ruler of Nepal. His old friend, the rani, was banished, 
and all posts of any consequence in the state were filled by Jung, 
his brothers and other relatives. In 1850, finding himself 
securely seated in power, Jung Bahadur paid a visit to England, 
which made a great impression on his acute intellect, and ever 
after he professed and proved himself to be a stanch friend of the 
British. On his return in 1851 he at once devoted himself to 
reforming the administration of the country, and, whatever may 
have been the means by which he gained power, it must be 
allowed that he exercised it so as to prove himself the greatest 
benefactor his country has ever possessed. In 1853 a treaty for 
the extradition of criminals was proposed, but it was not ratified 
till February 1855. In 1854 the Nepalese entered into a war 
with Tibet, which lasted with varying success till March 1856, 
when peace was concluded on terms very favourable to Nepal. 

In June 1857 intelligence of the mutiny cf the native troops in 
Hindustan reached Nepal, and produced much excitement. Jung 
Bahadur, in spite of great opposition, stood firm as a friend of the 
British. On the 26th June 4000 troops were sent off to assist, 
and these rendered good service in the campaign against the 
mutineers. Jung himself followed on the 10th of December, with 
a force of 8000 men, 500 artillerymen and 24 guns, but too late 
to be of much use. Many of the mutineers and rebels, including 
the infamous Nana Sahib, took refuge in the Nepalese tarai, 
and it was not till the end of 1859 that they were finally swept 
out of the country. The Nana was said to have died of fever in 
the tarai, and it is probable that this was the case. His wives 
and a few attendants resided for many years near Katmandu. 

In return for the aid afforded to the British, Jung Bahadur was 
well rewarded. He was created a G.C.B., and in 1873 a G.C.S.I., 
honours of which he was not a little proud. The troops employed 
received food and pay from the day of leaving Katmandu; 
handsome donations were given to those severely wounded, and 
to the relatives of the killed; great quantities of muskets and 
rifles were presented to the Nepalese government; and, to crown 
all, a large portion of the tarai was restored to Nepal. This 
ground contains most valuable sal and sisu forests, and yields a 
revenue of several lakhs of rupees yearly. 

From the termination of the mutiny Nepalese history has been 
uneventful. The country has been prosperous, and the relations 
with the British have continued to be most friendly. Neverthe- 
less the restrictions on commerce, and the prohibitions against 
Europeans entering the country, or travelling beyond certain 
narrow limits, are as rigidly enforced as they were a hundred 
years ago. Sir Jung Bahadur died suddenly in the tarai in 1877. 
In spite of all the exertions he had made to bring about a better 
state of things, three of his wives were allowed to immolate 
themselves on his funeral pyre. His brother, Sir Ranadip Singh 
Bahadur, G.C.S.I., succeeded him as prime minister. Shortly 
after his accession to power a plot was formed against him, but 
nearly forty of the conspirators were seized and executed, while

others escaped into exile. He was, however, murdered in 1885 
and was succeeded by his nephew Sir Shamsher Jung, G.C.S.I., 
who died in 1901 and was succeeded by his brother Deb Shamsher 
Jung. But in June of that year a palace revolution placed another 
brother, Chandra Shamsher Jung, in power, whilst Deb Shamsher 
fled to India. Maharajah Chandra Shamsher has ruled Nepal 
with much ability. He gave effective aid to the British during the 
Tibet war of 1904, and the relations with the government of 
India became more cordial after his accession to power. In 
1906 Chandra Shamsher was created a G. C.S.I. , and in 1908 he 
visited England as a guest of the government, when he was in- 
vested with the G.C.B. by King Edward VII. He was also made 
a major-general in the British army, and honorary colonel of the 
4th Gurkha Rifles.

NEPENTHES (Gr. vr\TT€vQk, sc. <f>apfxaKov, a drug that takes 
away grief, from vr\- privative, and 7re^os, " grief "), an 
Egyptian drug spoken of by Homer in the Odyssey (iv. 221). 
Generally in the form " nepenthe " the name is given to any 
drug having a like property, and also occasionally to the herb 
or plant from which such a drug is produced. It is also applied 
to a special genus of plants, chiefly East Indian, known as the 

»" pitcher-plants/' on account of the formation of the leaves. 
NEPHELINE, a rock-forming mineral consisting of sodium, 
potassium and aluminium silicate, NaeKzAlgSigOM* Its crystals 
belong to the hexagonal system, and usually have the form of 
a short six-sided prism terminated by the basal plane. The 
unsymmetrical etched figures produced artificially on the 
prism faces indicate, however, that the crystals are hemimorphic 
and tetartohedral, the only element of symmetry being a polar 
hexad axis. The hardness is 5^. The specific gravity (2-6), 
the low index of refraction and the feeble double refraction are 
nearly the same as in quartz; but since in.nepheline the sign of 
the double refraction is negative, whilst in quartz it is positive, 
the two minerals are readily distinguished under the microscope. 
An important determinative character of nepheline is the ease 
with which it is decomposed by hydrochloric acid, with separa- 
tion of gelatinous silica (which may be readily stained by 
colouring matters) and cubes of salt. A clear crystal of nepheline 
when immersed in acid becomes for this reason cloudy; hence 
the name nepheline, proposed by R. J. Haiiy in 1801, from Gr. 
ve<j>ekrj, a cloud. 

Although in naturally occurring nepheline sodium and potas- 
sium are always present in approximately the atomic ratio 3:1, 
artificially prepared crystals have the composition NaAlSiO^ 
the corresponding potassium compound, KAlSi04, which is 
the mineral kaliophilite, has also been prepared artificially. 
It has therefore been suggested that the orthosilicate formula, 
(NaK)AlSi0 4 , represents the true composition of nepheline. 

The mineral is one specially liable to alteration, and in the 
laboratory various substitution products of nepheline have been 
prepared. In nature it is frequently altered to zeolites (especially 
natrolite), sodalite, kaolin, or compact muscovite. Gieseckite 
and liebenerite are pseudomorphs. 

Two varieties of nepheline are distinguished, differing in their 
external appearance and in their mode of occurrence, being 
analogous in these respects to sanidine or glassy orthoclase and 
common orthoclase respectively. " Glassy nepheline " has the 
form of small, colourless, transparent crystals and grains with 
a vitreous lustre. It is characteristic of the later volcanic rocks 
rich in alkalis, such as phonolite, nepheline-basalt, leucite- 
basalt, &c, and also of certain dike-rocks, such as tinguaite. 
The best crystals are those which occur with mica, sanidine, 
garnet, &c, in the crystal-lined cavities of the ejected blocks 
of Monte Somma, Vesuvius. The other variety, known as 
elaeolite, occurs as large, rough crystals, or more often as 
irregular masses, which have a greasy lustre and are opaque, or 
at most translucent, with a reddish, greenish, brownish or grey 
colour. It forms an essential constituent of certain alkaline 



plutonic rocks of the nepheline-syenite series, which are typically 
developed in southern Norway. 

The colour and greasy lustre of elaeolite (a name given by 
M. H. Klaproth in 1809, from Gr. e\aiov, oil, and \tBos, stone; 
Ger. Fettstein) are due to the presence of numerous microscopic 
enclosures of other minerals, possibly augite or hornblende. 
These enclosures sometimes give rise to a chatoyant effect like 
that of cat's-eye and cymophane; and elaeolite when of a good 
green or red colour and showing a distinct band of light is some- 
times cut as a gem-stone with a convex surface. 

Closely allied to nepheline, and occurring with it in some 
nepheline-syenites, is the species cancrinite, which has the 
composition H6Na6Ca(NaC0 3 )2Als(Si04)9. It is frequently of 
a bright yellow colour, and has sometimes been cut as a gem- 
stone. (L. J. S.) 

NEPHELINE-SYENITE, or Elaeolite-syenite, a noncrystal- 
line plutonic rock which consists largely of nepheline and 
alkali felspar. The rocks are mostly pale coloured, grey or pink, 
and in general appearance they are not unlike granites, but dark 
green varieties are also known. They do not contain quartz, 
as that mineral and nepheline are mutually exclusive. From 
ordinary syenites they are distinguished not only by the presence 
of nepheline but also by the occurrence of many other minerals 
rich in alkalis or in rare earths. Orthoclase and albite are the 
principal felspars; usually they are intergrown to form perthite. 
In some rocks the potash felspar, in others the soda felspar 
predominates. Soda-lime felspars such as oligoclase and andesine 
are rare or entirely absent. Fresh clear microcline is very char- 
acteristic of some types of nepheline-syenite. Sodalite, colourless 
and transparent in the slides, but frequently pale blue in the 
hand specimens, is the principal felspathoid mineral in addition 
to nepheline. As a rule these two crystallize before felspar, 
but they may occur in perthitic intergrowth with it. The 
commonest ferro-magnesian mineral is pale green augite, which 
may be surrounded by rims of dark-green, pleochroic soda-augite 
(aegirine). The latter forms long flat prisms or bundles of 
radiating needles. A dark reddish-brown biotite is very common 
in some of these rocks and a white mica, probably not muscovite 
but lepidolite, is occasionally present. The hornblende may be 
brown, brownish-green, blue or blue-black, belonging as a rule 
to the varieties which contain soda; it is often intergrown with 
the pyroxene or enclosed in it*. The dark-brown trichnic. horn- 
blende aenigmatite occurs also in these rocks. Olivine is rare, 
but may be found in some basic forms of nepheline-syenite. 

The commonest accessories are sphene, zircon, iron ores and 
apatite. Cancrinite occurs in several nepheline-syenites; in 
others there is fluor-spar or melanite garnet. A great number 
of interesting and rare minerals have been recorded from 
nepheline-syenites and the pegmatite veins which intersect 
them. Among these we may mention eudialyte, eukolite, mos- 
andrite, rinkite, johnstrupite, lavenite, hiortdahlite, perofskite 
and lamprophyllite. Many of these contain fluorine and the 
rare earths. 

Nepheline-syenites are rare rocks; there is only one occurrence 
in Great Britain and one in France and Portugal. They are 
known also in Bohemia and in several places in Norway, Sweden 
and Finland. In America these rocks have been found in Texas, 
Arkansas and Massachussetts, also in Ontario, British Columbia 
and Brazil. South Africa, Madagascar, India, Tasmania, Timor 
and Turkestan are other localities for the rocks of this series. 
They exhibit also a remarkable individuality as each occurrence 
has its own special features; moreover a variety of types 
characterizes each occurrence, as these rocks are very variable. 
For these reasons, together with the numerous rare minerals 
they contain, they have attracted a great deal of attention from 
petrographers. 

Many types of nepheline-syenite have received designations 
derived from the localities in which they were discovered. The 
laurdalites (from Laurdal in Norway) are grey or pinkish, and in 
many ways closely resemble the la urvi kites of southern Norway, 
with which they occur. They contain anorthoclasc felspars of 
lozenge-shaped forms, biotite or greenish augite, much apatite and 
sometimes olivine. Some of these rocks arc porphyritic. The

NEPHELINITES— NEPI 



foyaites include the greater number of known nepheline-syenites 
and are called after Foya in the Serra de Monchique (southern 
Portugal), from which they were first 'described. They are grey, 
green or reddish, and mostly of massive structure with preponderat- 
ing potash felspar, some nepheline, and a variable (often small) 
amount of femic minerals. Pyroxene-, hornblende- and biotite- 
foyaites have been recognized according to their mineral com- 
position. Examples of the first-named occur in southern Norway 
with the laurdalites; they contain aegirine and black mica. At 
Alno Island in the Gulf of Bothnia (Sweden) similar rocks are found 
bearing enclosures or altered limestone with wollastonite and 
scapolite. In Siebenburgen (Hungary) there is a well-known rock 
of this group, very rich in microcline, blue^ sodaliteand cancrinite. 
It contains also orthoclase, nepheline, biotite, aegirine, acmite, &c. 
To this type the name ditroite has been given from the place where 
it occurs (Ditro). Pyroxene-foyaite has been described also from 
Pouzac in the Pyrenees (S. France). Mica-foyaite is not very 
common, but is known at Miask in the Ural Mountains (miaskite), 
where it is coarse-grained, and contains black mica, sodalite and 
cancrinite. The hornblende-foyaites are usually brown or blue, 
and intensely dichroic, but may contain also biotite or augite. 
Rocks of this class occur in Brazil (Serra de Tingua) containing 
sodalite and often much augite, in the western Sahara and Cape 
Verde Islands; also at Zwarte Koppies in the Transvaal, Madagascar, 
Sao Paulo (in Brazil), Paisano Pass (West Texas) and Montreal, 
Canada. The rock of Salem, Mass., U.S.A., is a mica-foyaite rich in 
albite and aegirine ; it accompanies granite and essexite. 

Litchfieldite is another well-marked type of nepheline-syenite, 
in which albite is the dominant felspar. It is named after Litch- 
field, Maine, U.S.A., where it occurs in scattered blocks. Biotite, 
cancrinite and sodalite are characteristic of this rock. A similar 
nepheline-syenite is known from Hastings Co., Ontario, and con- 
tains hardly any orthoclase, but onlyalbite felspar. . Nepheline is 
very abundant and there is also cancrinite, sodalite, scapolite, calcite, 
biotite and hornblende. The lujaurites are distinguished from the 
rocks above described by their dark colour, which is due to the 
abundance of minerals such as augite, aegirine, arfvedsonite and 
other kinds of amphibole. Typical examples are known near Lujaur 
on the White Sea, where tney^ occur with umptekites and other 
very peculiar rocks. Other localities for this group are at Tulianehaab 
t in Greenland (with sodalite-syenite) ; at their margins they contain 
pseudomorphs after leucite. The lujaurites frequently have a 
parallel-banding or gneissose structure. 

Sodalite-syenites in which sodalite very largely or completely 
takes the place of nepheline occur in Greenland, where they contain 
also microcline-perthite, aegirine, arfvedsonite and eudialyte- 
Cancrinite-syenite, with a large percentage of cancrinite, has been 
described from Dalekarlia (Sweden) and from Finland. We may 
also mention urtite from Lujaur Urt on the White Sea, which con- 
sists very largely of nepheline, with aegirine and apatite, but no 
felspar. Jacupirangite (from Jacupiranga in Brazil) is a blackish 
rock composed of titaniferous augite, magnetite, ilmenite, perofskite 
and nepheline, with secondary biotite. 

The chemical peculiarities of the nepheline-syemtes are well 
marked, as will be seen from the following analyses. They are 
exceedingly rich in alkalis and in alumina (hence the abundance of 
felspathoids and alkali felspars) with silica varying from 50 to 56%, 
while lime, magnesia and iron are never present in great quantity, 
though somewhat more variable than the other components. As a 
group, also, these rocks have a low specific gravity.

NEPHELINITES. The group of effusive rocks which contains 
nepheline with plagioclase felspar is subdivided into nepheline- 
tephrites and nephetine-basanites, while those which contain 
nepheline but not felspar are nephelinites and nepheline-basalts. 
The tephrites differ from the basanites in the absence of olivine, 
and the same distinction subsists between the nephelinites and 
nepheline-basalts. 

Lavas with nepheline, plagioclase and augite = nepheline- 
tephrites. 
Lavas with nepheline, plagioclase, augite and olivine = nepheline- 
• basanites. 

Lavas with nepheline and augite = nephelinites. 

Lavas with nepheline, augite and olivine = nepheline-basalts. 

In their essential and accessory minerals, appearance and 
structure, these rocks have much in common, and they tend to 
occur in a natural association as basic rocks comparatively rich 
in alkalis and alumina. The nephelinites and tephrites are rather 



closely linked to the phonolites and pass into them by various 
gradations. They are usually richer in alkalis and silica and 
contain less iron, lime and magnesia than the basanites and 
nepheline-basalts, a difference which finds expression in the 
presence of olivine and the smaller amount of felspars and 
felspathoids in the latter. 

The nepheline is colourless and transparent when fresh, often 
in six-sided prisms, but also as irregular interstitial masses 
filling the spaces between the other minerals, and hard to identify 
owing to its low double refraction and frequent decomposition. 
Leucite appears in some tephrites; haiiyne is more frequent as 
small dodecahedra often filled with black inclusions. The 
augite varies a gcod deal, being bright green or dark green 
(aegirine) and rich in sdda in some tephrites and nephelinites, 
while in basanites and basalts it is often brown " basaltic " 
augite or purple " titaniferous " augite. It has often good 
crystalline form, and occurs as eight-sided monoclinic prisms, 
but the soda augites may be of late crystallization and form 
mossy or irregular growths in the matrix. Brown hornblende is 
much less common, and a red biotite is very characteristic of 
certain nephelinites. Of the felspars, labradorite is probably the 
most common, with more acid varieties of plagioclase. Sanidine 
is by no means absent, but may be considered as an accessory. 
The olivine presents no peculiarities. Mclilite, perofskite, 
pseudobrookite, melanite garnet, iron oxides, apatite and 
chromite are occasionally met with. 

All these rocks are practically confined to lavas of Tertiary and 
recent age, though some occur as dikes or small intrusive masses. 
The plutonic facies of these rocks are found among thetheralites, 
shonkinites, essexites and ijolites. In the British Isles they are 
exceedingly scarce, though nepheline-basanite occurs in a dike 
which is presumably Tertiary, cutting the Triassic rocks at Butterton 
in Staffordshire, and nepheline-basalt has been found in a single 
neck at John o* Groat's in Caithness and at one or two places near 
North^ Berwick in Haddingtonshire. They attain a great develop- 
ment in the Canary Islands (Teneriffe, Grand Canary, &c.) and in 
the Azores, Cape Verde Islands and Fernando Noronha. In Germany 
they are represented among the Tertiary eruptive rocks of the 
Rhine district and Thuringia, at the extinct craters of the Eiffel 
and at the Kaiserstuhl. In central Bohemia there are many occur- 
rences of nepheline-tephrites, basanites and basalts which though 
fine grained contain all their minerals in excellent preservation. 
The nephelinite of Katzenbuckel in the Odenwald is well known. 
Contrasted with the phonolites and leucitophyres these rocks are 
scarce in Italy and the Mediterranean province, but leucite-bearing 
nepheline-tephrites occur at Monte Vulture and nepheline-basalts in 
Tripoli. In America these rocks occur in Texas, in the Bearpaw 
Mountains of Montana and at Cripple Creek, Colorado. From 
Argentina some members have been described: thay have a great 
extension in East Africa (Somaliland and Masai-land) and occur also 
in North Nigeria. A few also have been described from New South 
Wales, New Zealand (Dunedin) and Tasmania. (J. S. F.) 

NEPHEW, the son of a brother or sister. The word is adapted 
from Fr. neveu, Lat. nepos (originally " grandson " or " de- 
scendant "). The O. Eng. nefa survived in the form neve till the 
15th century; this represents the Teutonic branch, cf. Ger. 
Neffe, Dutch neef; the ultimate root is seen in the cognate 
Gr. veiroSeSj " descendants," aveptSs, " kinsman," and Sans. 
napdt t napt, " descendants " or " descendant." The correlative 
" niece," the daughter of a brother or sister, is from Fr. niece, 
Lat. neptis, the feminine form of nepos; the O. Eng. word was nift r 
cf. Ger. Nichtc. A euphemistic use of " nephew " is that of the 
natural son of a pope, cardinal or other ecclesiastic; and from 
the practice of granting preferments to such children the word 
" nepotism " is used of any favouritism shown in finding positions 
for a man's family. 

NEPI (anc. Nepet or Nepete), a town and episcopal see of Italy, 
in the province of Rome, 7$ m. S.W. of the town of Civita 
Castellana, 738 ft. above sea-level. Pop. (1901) 2973. The site, 
surrounded by ravines and accessible only on the \V., is naturally 
strong and characteristic of an Etruscan town; on this side 
there is a considerable fragment of the ancient Etruscan wall, 
built of rectangular blocks of tufa (whether the rest of the site 
was protected by walls is uncertain), and a ruined castle, erected 
by Antonio da Sangallo the elder in 1499, for Pope Alexander VL, 
and restored by Pope Paul III. The municipio (town hall) is 
from the designs of Vignola, and contains some ancient

inscriptions. The cathedral was burnt down by the French in 1789 
and restored in 1831. A mile and a half E.N.E. is the Roman- 
esque church of S Elia, founded about a.d. 1000, with frescoes 
of the period. It contains a pulpit of the time of Pope Gregory 
IV. (827-844), the sculptures of which are scattered about the 
church (F. Mazzanti in Nuovo Bollettino 6/ Archaeologia Cristiana, 
1896, 34). 

Nepet had become Roman before 386 B.C., when Livy speaks 
of it and Sutrium as the keys of Etruria. In that year it was 
surrendered to the Etruscans and recovered by the Romans, 
who beheaded the authors of its surrender. It became a colony 
in 383 B.C. It was among the twelve Latin colonies that refused 
further help to Rome in 209 b.c. After the Social War it became 
a municiptum. It is hardly mentioned in imperial times, except 
as a station on the road (Via Amerina) which diverged from the 
Via Cassia near the modern Settevene and ran to Ameria and 
Tuder. In the 8th century a.d. it was for a short while the seat 
of a dukedom.

NEPOMUK (or Pomuk), JOHN OF, the national saint of 
Bohemia. It is necessary to distinguish between the John of 
Nepomuk of history and the legendary one. In 1393 a dispute 
arose between King Wenceslaus IV. of Bohemia and the arch- 
bishop of Prague, John of Jenzenstein. Wenceslaus, wishing to 
found a new bishopric in south-western Bohemia, determined to 
seize the revenues of the abbey of Kladrub as soon as the aged 
abbot Racek should die. The archbishop opposed this plan, 
and by his orders his vicar-general, John of Pomuk — son of a 
German named Wolfel, a citizen of Pomuk — advised the monks 
to elect a new abbot immediately after Racek's death. This 
greatly incensed the king, who summoned ,the archbishop and 
some of his clergy — among whom was Pomuk — to appear before 
him. He ordered them to be immediately arrested, and though 
the archbishop escaped his four companions — among them 
Pomuk — were seized and subjected to cruel torture. They were 
ordered to abandon the archbishop. Three of them consented, 
but Pomuk, who refused to submit and was already on the point 
of death, was carried to the bridge of Prague and thrown into 
the Vltava. It is difficult to connect this historical event with 
the legend of St John of Nepomuk, who was canonized by the 
church of Rome in 1729, mainly by the influence of the Jesuits, 
who hoped that this new cult would obliterate the memory of 
Hus. The Austrian chronicler Thomas Ebendorffer of Hasel- 
bach, who lived two generations later, first states that it was 
reported that King Wenceslaus had ordered that the confessor 
of his queen — an office that John of Pomuk never held — should 
be thrown into the Vltava because he would not reveal the secret 
of confession. The story is afterwards told in greater detail by 
the untrustworthy Bohemian historian Wenceslaus Hajek. It 
appears certain that the person canonized in 1729 was not the 
historical John of Pomuk or Nepomuk. 

See A. H. Wratislaw, Life, Legend and Canonization of St John 
Nepomuk (1873), a valuable work founded on the best Bohemian 
authorities; also A. Frind, Der geschichUiche Heilige Johann von 
Nepomuk (1861); O. Abel, Die Legende vom keiligen Johann von 
Nepomuk (1855); and particularly vol. iii. of W. W. Tomek's 
History of the Townof Prague (Czech) (12 vols., Prague, 1855-1901). 

NEPOS, CORNELIUS (c. 90-24 B.C.), Roman historian, friend 
of Catullus, Cicero and At ticus, was born in Upper Italy (perhaps 
at Verona or Ticinum). He wrote: Chronica, an epitome of 
universal history; Exempla, a collection of anecdotes after the 
style of Valerius Maximus; letters to Cicero; lives of Cato the 
elder and Cicero; and De viris illustribus, parallel lives of dis- 
tinguished Romans and foreigners, in sixteen books. One section 
of this voluminous work (De excellentibus ducibus exterarum 
gentium, more commonly known as Vitae excellentium impera- 
torum) and the biographies of Cato and Atticus from another 
(De Latinis historicis) have been preserved. Erotic poems and 
a geographical treatise are also attributed to him. Nepos is not 
altogether happy in the subjects of his biographies, and he writes 
rather as a panegyrist than as a biographer, although he can 
rebuke his own countrymen on occasion. The Lives contain 
xix. 13 



many errors (especially in chronology), but supply information 
not found elsewhere. The language is as a rule simple and 
correct. The Lives were formerly attributed to Aemilius Probus 
of the 4th century a.d.; but the view maintained by Lambinus 
(in his famous edition, 1 569)— that they are all the work of Nepos 
— is now generally accepted. A dedicatory epigram written by 
Probus to the emperor Theodosius and inserted after the life of 
Hannibal, was the origin of the mistake. This dedication, if 
genuine, would only prove that Probus copied (and perhaps modi- 
fied and abridged) the work. In modern times G. F. Unger (Der 
sogenannleC.N., 1881) has attempted to prove that the author 
was Hyginus, but his theory has not been favourably received. 

Editions of the Lives (especially selections) are extremely numer- 
ous; text by E. O. Winstedt (Oxford, 1904), C. L. Roth (1881), 
C. G. Cobet (1881), C. Halm and A. Fleckeisen (1889), with lexicon 
for school use; with notes, O. Browning and W. R. Inge (1888), 
J. C. Rolfe (U.S. 1894), A. Weidner and J. Schmidt (1902), C. Erbe 
(1892), C. Nipperdey and B. Lupus (ed. maj., 1879, school ed., 
1895), J- Siebehs and O. Stange (1897). 

NEPOS, JULIUS, the last but one of the Roman emperors 
of the West (474-475). He was a nephew of Marcellinus, prince 
of Dalmatia, whom he succeeded in his principality. After 
the death of Olybrius the throne of the West remained vacant 
for some months, during which Italy was abandoned to bar- 
barians. Being connected by marriage with Leo I., emperor of 
the East, he was selected by him to succeed Olybrius on the 
Western throne, and proclaimed at Ravenna. After capturing 
his rival Glycerius, who had been nominated by the army in 
473, at the mouth of the Tiber, he was recognized as emperor 
in Rome, Italy and Gaul. The only event of the reign of Nepos 
was the inglorious cession to the Visigoths of the province of 
Auvergne. In 475 Orestes, father of Augustulus, afterwards 
the last emperor of the West, raised the standard of revolt and 
marched against Nepos at Ravenna. The emperor fled into 
Dalmatia, and continued to reside at Salona until his assassina- 
tion by two of his own officers in 48b, possibly at the instigation 
of Glycerius, who had been compelled to enter the church and 
had been appointed bishop of Salona.

NEPTUNE (Lat. Neptunus), an Italian god, of unknown 
origin and meaning, paired with Salacia, possibly the goddess 
of the salt water. At an early date (399 B.C.) he was identified 
with the Greek Poseidon (q.v.), when the Sibylline books ordered 
a lectisternium in his honour (Livy v. 13). His festival, Nep- 
tunalia, at which tents were made from the branches of trees, 
was celebrated on the 23rd of July, and his temple, containing a 
famous marine group by Scopas, stood near the Circus Flaminius. 
In earlier times it was the god Fortunus who was thanked for naval 
victories; but Sextus Pompeius called himself son of Neptune, 
and Agrippa dedicated to Neptune a temple (Basilica Neptuni) in 
the Campus Martius in honour of the naval victory of Actium. 

NEPTUNE, in astronomy, the outermost known planet of 
our solar system ; its symbol is W . Its distance from the sun is 
a little more than 30 astronomical units, i.e. 30 times the mean 
distance of the earth from the sun, or about 2,796,000,000 m. 
It deviates greatly from Bode's law, which would give a 
distance of nearly 39. Its orbit is more nearly circular than 
that of any other major planet, Venus excepted. Its time of 
revolution is 165 years. Being of the 8th stellar magnitude it 
is invisible to the naked eye. In a small telescope it cannot 
be distinguished from a fixed star, but in a large one it is seen 
to have a disk about 2-3* in diameter, of a pale bluish hue. No 
features and no change of appearance can be detected upon it, so 
that observation can give no indication of its rotation. Both its 
optical aspect and the study of its spectrum seem to show that it 
resembles Uranus. Its spectrum shows marked absorption-bands 
in the red and yellow, indicating an atmosphere of great depth 
of which hydrogen would seem to be a constituent. (See Planet.) 

Only a single satellite of Neptune is yet known. This was dis- 
covered by William Lassell soon after the discovery of the planet. 
Its period of revolution is $d. 21 h. Its motion is retrograde, in a 
plane making an angle of about 35 with the orbit of the planet. 
This was the first case of retrograde motion found in any of the

planets or satellites of the solar system. The most noteworthy feature 
connected with the satellite is a secular change which is going on in 
the position of its orbital plane. Were the planet spherical in form, 
no such change could occur, except an extremely slow one produced 
by the action of the sun. The change is therefore attributed to a 
considerable ellipticity of the planet, which is thus inferred to be in 
rapid rotation. It will ultimately be possible to determine from this 
motion the position of the a^is of rotation of Neptune with much 
greater precision than it could possibly be directly observed. 

The following elements of the satellite were determined by H. 
Struve from all the observations available up to 1892:

Discovery of Neptune. — The detection of Neptune through 
its action upon Uranus before its existence had been made known 
by observation is a striking example of the precision reached 
by the theory of the celestial motions. So many agencies were 
concerned in the final discovery that the whole forms one of 
the most interesting chapters in the history of astronomy. The 
planet Uranus, before its actual discovery by Sir William 
Herschel in 1781, had been observed as a fixed star on at least 
17 other occasions, beginning with Flamsteed in 1690. In 1820 
Alexis Bouvard of Paris constructed tables of the motion of 
Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus, based upon a discussion of observa- 
tions up to that year. Using the mutual perturbations of these 
planets as developed by Laplace in the Micanique CHeste, he 
was enabled satisfactorily to represent the observed positions 
of Jupiter and Saturn; but the case was entirely different 
with Uranus. It was found impossible to represent all the 
observations within admissible limits of error, the outstanding 
differences between theory and observation exceeding 1'. In 
these circumstances one of two courses had to be adopted, 
either to obtain the best general representation of all the observa- 
tions, which would result in the tables being certainly erroneous, 
or to reject the older observations which might be affected with 
errors, and base the tables only on those made since the discovery 
by Herschel. A few years of observation showed that Uranus 
was deviating from the new tables to an extent greater than 
could be attributed to legitimate errors of theory of observation, 
and the question of the cause thus became of growing interest. 
Among the investigators of the question was F. W. Bessel, 1 
who tried to reconcile the difficulty by an increase of the mass 
of Saturn, but found that he could do so only by assigning a 
mass not otherwise admissible. Although the idea that the 
deviations were probably due to the action of an ultra-Uranian 
planet was entertained by Bouvard, Bessel and doubtless 
others, it would seem that the first clear statement of a con- 
viction that such was the case, and that it was advisable to 
reach some conclusion as to the position of the disturbing body, 
was expressed by the Rev. T. J. Hussey, an English amateur 
astronomer. In a letter to Sir George B. Airy in 1834 he inquired 
Airy's views of the subject, and offered to search for the planet 
with his own equatorial if the required estimate of its position 
could be supplied. Airy expressed himself as not fully satisfied 
that the deviation might not arise from errors in the perturba- 
tions. He therefore was not certain of any extraneous action; 
but even if there was, he doubted the possibility of determining 
the place of a planet which might produce it. In 1837 Bouvard, 
in conjunction with his nephew Eugene, was again working 
on the problem; but it does not seem that they went farther 
than to collect observations and to compare the results with 
Bouvard's tables. 

In 1835 F. B. G. Nicolai, director of the observatory at 
Mannheim, in discussing the motion of Halley's comet,* con- 
sidered the possibility that it was acted upon by an ultra- 

1 Brief wechsel zivischen Oilers u. Bessel, ii. 250 (Oct. 9, 1823). 



Uranian planet, the existence of which was made probable by 
the disagreement between the older and more recent observations. 2 

In 1838 Airy showed in a letter to the Astronomische Nach- 
rickten that not only the heliocentric longitude, but the tabulated 
radius vector of Uranus was largely in error, but made no 
suggestions as to the cause. 3 

In 1843 the Royal Society of Sciences of Gottingen offered 
a prize of 50 ducats for a satisfactory working up of the whole 
theory of the motions of Uranus, assigning September 1846 
as the time within which competing papers should be presented. 

It is also recorded that Bessel, during a visit to England 
in 1842, in a conversation with Sir John Herschel, expressed 
the conviction that Uranus was disturbed by an unknown 
planet, and announced his intention of taking up the subject. 4 
He went so far as to set his assistant Fleming at the work of 
reducing the observations, but died before more was done. 

The question had now reached a stage when it needed only 
a vigorous effort by an able mathematician to solve the problem. 
Such a man was found in John Couch Adams, then a student 
of St John's College, Cambridge, who seriously attacked the 
problem in 1843, the year in 'which he took his bachelor's degree. 
He soon found that the observations of Uranus could be fairly 
well represented by the action of a planet moving in a radius 
of twice the mean distance of Uranus, which would closely 
correspond to Bode's law. During the two following years he 
investigated the possible eccentricity of the orbit, and in 
September 1845 communicated his results to Professor James 
Challis. In 1845, about the 1st of November, Adams also sent 
his completed elements to Airy, stating that according to his 
calculations the observed irregularities in the motion of Uranus 
could be accounted for by the action of an exterior planet, of 
which the motions and orbital elements, were given. It is 
worthy of note that the heliocentric longitude of the unknown 
body as derived from these- elements is only between one and 
two degrees in error, while the planet was within half a degree 
of the ecliptic. Two or three evenings assiduously devoted to 
the search could not therefore have failed to make the planet 
known. Adams's paper was accompanied by a comparison of 
his theory with the observations of Uranus from 1780, showing 
an excellent agreement. Airy in replying to this letter inquired 
whether the assumed perturbation would also explain the error 
of the radius-vector of Uranus, which he seemed to consider 
the crucial test of correctness. It does not seem that any 
categorical reply to this question was made by Adams. 

Meanwhile, at the suggestion of Arago, the investigation had 
been taken up by U. J. J. Leverrier, who had published some 
excellent work in theoretical astronomy. Leverrier's first 
published communication on the subject was made to the French 
Academy on the 10th of November 1845, a few days after 
Adams's results were in the hands of Airy and Challis. A second 
memoir was presented by Leverrier in 1846 (June 1). His 
investigation was more thorough than that of Adams. He first 
showed that the observations of Uranus could not be accounted 
for by the attraction of known bodies. Considering in succession 
various explanations, he found none admissible except that of 
a planet exterior to Uranus. Considering the distances to be 
double that of Uranus he then investigated the other elements 
of the orbit. He also attempted, but by a faulty method, to 
determine the limits within which the elements must be contained.

The longitude of the actual planet was 327 57' on the 1st of 
October 1846. 

The close agreement of these elements led Airy to suggest 
to Challis, on the 9th of July 1846, a search for the planet with 
the Northumberland telescope. He proposed an examination 
of a part of the heavens 30 long in the direction of the ecliptic 
and io° broad, and estimated the number of hours' work likely 
to be employed in this sweep. The proposed sweeps were 
commenced by Challis on the 29th of July, The plan required 
each region to be swept through twice, and the positions of all 
the known stars found to be compared, in order that the position 
of the planet might be detected by its motion. On the 31st of 
August Leverrier's concluding paper was presented to the French 
Academy, and on the 18th of September he wrote to John G. 
Galle (1812-1910), then chief assistant at the Berlin observatory, 
suggesting that he should search for the computed planet, with 
the hope of detecting it by its disk, which was probably more 
than 3* in diameter. This letter, probably received on the 23rd 
of September, was communicated to J. F. Encke, the. director 
of the observatory, who approved of the search. EL L. d'Arrest, 
a student living at the observatory, expressed a wish to assist. 
In the evening the search was commenced, but it was not found 
possible to detect any planet by its disk. Star charts were at 
the time being prepared at the observatory under the auspices 
of the Berlin Academy of Sciences. It was suggested by d'Arrest 
that this region might be covered by one of the charts. Referring 
to the chart, which was lying in a drawer, it was found that such 
was the case. Comparing the stars on the chart one by one 
with the heavens it was found that an eighth magnitude star 
now visible was not on the chart. This object was observed 
until after midnight, but no certain motion was detected. On 
the following evening the object was again looked for, and found 
to have actually moved. The existence of the planet was thus 
established. It was afterwards found that Challis in his sweeps 
had observed the planet on the 4th of August, but, not having 
compared his observations with those made subsequently, had 
r failed to detect it. 

The question whether Leverrier should receive the sole credit 
of the discovery was warmly discussed. Arago took the extreme 
ground that actual publication alone should be considered, 
rejecting Adams's communications to Airy and Challis as quite 
unworthy of consideration. He also suggested that the name 
of Leverrier should be given to the planet, but this proposal 
was received with so little favour outside of France that he 
speedily withdrew it, proposing that of Neptune instead. 

The observations at the first opposition showed that the planet 
was moving in a nearly circular orbit, and was at a mean distance 
from the sun much less than that set by Leverrier as the smallest 
possible. The latter had in fact committed the error of deter- 
mining the limits by considering the variations of the elements 
one at a time, assuming in the case of each that while it varied 
the others remained constant. But a simultaneous variation 
of all the elements would have shown that the representation 
of the observations of Uranus would be improved by a simul- 
taneous diminution of both the eccentricity and the mean 
distance, the orbit becoming more nearly circular and the 
planet being brought nearer to the sun. But this was not at 
first clearly seen, and Benjamin Peirce of Harvard University 
went so far as to maintain that there was a discontinuity between 
the solution of Adams and Leverrier and the solution offered 
by the planet itself, and that the coincidence in direction of the 
actual and computed planet was an accident. But this view 
was not well founded, and the only explanation needed was to 
be found in Leverrier's faulty method of determining the limits 
within which the planet must be situated. As a matter of 
fact the actual motion of the planet during the century preceding, 
as derived from Leverrier's elements, was much nearer the truth 
than the elements themselves were. This arose from the fact 
that his very elliptic orbit, by its large eccentricity, brought the 
planet near to the sun, and therefore near to its true position, 
during the period from 1780 to 1845, when the action on Uranus 
was at its greatest. 



The observations of the first opposition enabled Sears Cook 
Walker of the National Observatory, Washington, in February 
1847 to compute the past positions of the planet, and identify 
it with a star observed by Lalande at Paris in May 1795. This 
being communicated to the Paris observatory, an examination 
of Lalande's manuscript showed that he had made two observa- 
tions of the planet, on the 8th and 10th of May, and finding 
them discordant had rejected one as probably in error, and 
marked the other as questionable. A mere re-examination of 
the region to see which observation was in error would have led 
him to the discovery of the planet more than half a century 
before it was actually recognized. The identity of Lalande's 
star with Neptune was also independently shown by Petersen 
of Altona, before any word of Walker's work had reached him.

N^RAC, a town of south-western France, capital of an arron- 
dissement in the department of Lot-et-Garonne, 16 m. W.S.W. 
of Agen by road. Pop. (1906) town, 4018; commune, 6318. 
The town, once the capital of the dukes of Albret, is divided by 
the 'Baise into two parts, Grand -N6rac on the left bank and 
Petit-Nerac on the right bank. The river is spanned by a bridge 
of the 16th century, called the Pont Vieux, and by the Pont 
Neuf, of modern construction. Narrow winding streets often 
bordered by old houses ascend from the narrow quays on both 
banks. From the left bank a staircase leads to the Rue Henri 
Quatre, where stands a wing of the castle in which Henry IV. 
lived. A statue of the king stands in one of the squares. The 
former palace of the Chambre des Comptes is now occupied 
by the tribunal of commerce, the library and the museum. The 
church of Grand-N6rac of the 18th century and the church 
of Petit-Nerac of the 19th century offer no remarkable features. 
On the left bank of the Baise, above* Grand-N6rac, market 
gardens have taken the place of the old gardens of the Sires 
d'Albret, but remains of the Palais des Mariannes and of the 
Pavilion des Bains du Roi de Navarre, both of Renaissance 
architecture, are left. The famous promenade of La Garenne 
laid out by Antoine de Bourbon, king of Navarre, stretches 
for more than a mile along the opposite bank of the river. The 
remains of a Roman villa, including a fragment of mosaic, have 
been found there. A road leads from the south end of La 
Garenne to the ruins of the feudal castle of Nazareth. The 
Chateau du Tasta of the 15th century is within a short distance 
of N6rac. The town has a sub-prefecture, and the industries 
include brewing and cork-working. 

Nerac appears at the beginning of the nth century as a 
possession of the monks of St Pierre de Condom. The lords of 
Albret gradually deprived them of their authority over the town, 
and at the beginning of the 14th century founded a castle on the 
left bank of the Baise. In the 16th century the castle was the 
residence of Henry IV. during much of his youth and of

NERBUDDA— NERGAL 



Marguerite de Valois, sister of Francis L, of Jeanne d'Albret, 
and of the second Marguerite de Valois, wife of Henry IV., 
who held a brilliant court there. N6rac, the inhabitants of which 
had adopted the Reformed religion, was seized by the Catholics 
in 1562. The conferences, held there at the end of 1578 between 
the Catholics and Protestants, ended in February 1579 in the 
peace of N6rac. In 1580 the town was used by Henry IV. as 
a base for attacks on] the Agenais, Armagnac and Guienne. 
A Chambre de TEdit for Guienne and a Chambre des Comptes 
were established there by Henry IV. In 1621, however, the 
town took part in the Protestant rising, was taken by the troops 
of Louis XIII. and its fortifications dismantled. Soon after it 
was deprived both of the Chambre de TEdit and of the Chambre 
des Comptes, and its ruin was completed by the revocation of 
the Edict of Nantes in 1685. 

NERBUDDA, or Narbada, a river of India. It is traditionally 
regarded as the boundary between Hindustan proper and the 
Deccan. It rises on the summit of Amarkantak hill in Rewa 
state, and for the first 200 m. of its course winds among the 
Mandla hills, which form the head of the Satpura range; then 
at Jubbulpore, passing through the " Marble Rocks," it enters its 
proper valley between the Vindhyan and Satpura ranges, and 
pursues a direct westerly course to the Gulf of Cambay. Its 
total course through the Central Provinces and Gujarat amounts 
to about 800 m., and it falls into the sea in the Bombay district 
of Broach. It receives the drainage of the northern slopes 
of the Satpuras, but not that of the Vindhyan tableland, the 
streams from which flow into the Ganges and Jumna. After 
leaving the Central Provinces, the river widens out in the fertile 
district of Broach, with an average breadth of J m. to 1 m. 
Below Broach city it forms an estuary which is 13 m. broad 
where it enters the Gulf of Cambay. The Nerbudda is nowhere 
utilized for irrigation, and navigation is confined to the lower 
section. In the rainy season boats of considerable size sail about 
60 m. above Broach city. Sea-going vessels of abqut 70 tons 
frequent the port of Broach, but they are entirely dependent 
on the tide. In sanctity the Nerbudda ranks only second 
to the Ganges among the rivers of India, and along its whole 
course are special places of pilgrimage. The most meritorious 
act that a pilgrim can perform is to walk from the sea to the source 
of the river and back along the opposite bank. This pilgrimage 
takes from one to two years to accomplish. 

The Nerbudda has given its name to a division of the Central 
Provinces, comprising the five districts of Narsinghpur, Hoshanga* 
bad, Nimar, Betul and Chhindwara. Area, 18,382 sq. m. ; 
pop. (1001) 1,785,008. 

NERCHINSK, a town of Eastern Siberia, in the government 
of Transbaikalia, 183 m. by rail E. of Chita, on the left bank of 
the Nercha, 2% m. above its confluence with the Shilka. Pop. 
(1897) 6713. It is badly built of wood, and its lower parts 
frequently suffer from inundations. It has a small museum. 
The inhabitants support themselves mainly by agriculture, 
tobacco-growing and cattle-breeding; a few merchants trade in 
furs and cattle, in brick -tea from China, and manufactured 
wares from Russia. 

The fort of Nerchinsk dates from 1654, and the town was 
founded in 1658 by Pashkov, who in that year opened direct 
communication between the Russian settlements in Transbaikalia 
and those on the Amur which had been founded by Cossacks and 
fur-traders coming from the Yakutsk region. In 1689 was signed 
between Russia and China the treaty of Nerchinsk, which 
stopped for two centuries the farther advance of the Russians into 
the basin of the Amur. After that Nerchinsk became the chief 
centre for the trade with China. The opening of the western 
route through Mongolia, by Urga, and the establishment of a 
custom-house at Kiakhta in 1728 diverted this trade into a new 
channel. But Nerchinsk acquired fresh importance from the 
influx of immigrants, mostly exiles, into eastern Transbaikalia, 
the discovery of rich mines and the arrival of great numbers of 
convicts, and ultimately it became the chief town of Trans- 
baikalia. In 181 2 it was transferred from the banks of the Shilka 
to its present site, on account of the floods. Since the foundation, 



in 1851, of Chita, the present capital of Transbaikalia, Nerchinsk 
has been falling into decay. 

NERCHINSK (in full Nerchinskiy Zavod), a town and silver- 
mine of East Siberia, in the government of Transbaikalia, 150 m. 
E.S.E. of another Nerchinsk (q.v.) (with which it is often con- 
fused), on a small affluent of the Argun. Pop. (1897) 3000. 
It lies in a narrow valley between barren mountains, and is much 
better built than any of the district towns of East Siberia. It 
has a chemical laboratory for mining purposes, and a meteoro- 
logical observatory (51 18' N., 119 37' E., 2200 ft. above 
sea-level), where meteorological and magnetical observations 
have been made every hour since 1842. The average yearly 
temperature is 25-3° F., with extremes of 97*7° and -52-6°. 

Nerchinsk Mining District extends over an area of 29,450 
sq. m., and includes all the silver-mines and gold-fields between 
the Shilka and the Argun, together with a few on the left bank 
of the Shilka. It is traversed by several parallel chains of moun- 
tains which rise to 4500 ft., and are intersected by a complicated 
system of deep, narrow valleys, densely wooded, with a few 
expansions along the larger rivers, where the inhabitants with 
difficulty raise some rye and wheat. The population (75,625 
in 1897) consists of Russians, Buryats and Tunguses. Included 
in this number were some 2300 convicts. The mountains, so 
far as they have been geologically explored, consist of crystalline 
slates and limestones — probably Upper Silurian and Devonian — 
interspersed with granite, syenite and diorite; they contain 
rich ores of silver, lead, tin and iron, while the diluvial and 
alluvial valley formations contain productive auriferous sands. 

The Nerchinsk silver mines began to be worked in 1704, but 
during the first half of the 18th century their yearly production did 
not exceed 8400 oz., and the total amount for the first 150 years 
( 1 704-1 854) amounted to 11,540,000 oz. The lead was mostly 
neglected on account of the^ difficulties of transport, but its pro- 
duction is at present on the increase. Gold was first discovered in 
1830, and between 1833 and 1855 260,000 oz. of gold dust were 
obtained. In 1864 a large number of auriferous deposits were dis- 
covered. Until 1863 all the labour was performed by serfs, the 
property of the emperor, and by convicts, numbering usually 
nearly four thousand. 

NEREUS, in Greek mythology, the eldest son of Pontus and 
Gaea, and father of the fifty Nereids. He is a beneficent and 
venerable old man of the sea, full of wisdom and skilled in 
prophecy, but, like Proteus, he will only reveal what he knows 
under compulsion. Thus Heracles seized him when asleep, and, 
although he attempted to escape by assuming various forms, 
compelled him to reveal the whereabouts of the apples of the 
Hesperides (Apollodorus ii. 5). His favourite dwelling-place is a 
cavern in the depths of the Aegean. The fifty daughters of 
Nereus, the Nereids, are personifications of the smiling, quiet sea. 
Of these, Thetis and Amphitrite rule the sea according to the 
legend of different localities; Galatea is a Sicilian figure, who 
plays with and deludes her rustic lover of the shore, Polyphemus. 
Nereus is represented with the sceptre and trident; the Nereids 
are depicted as graceful maidens, lightly clad or naked, riding on 
tritons and dolphins. The name has nothing to do with the 
modern Greek vepb (really veapbv, " fresh " [water]) : it is prob- 
ably a short form of N^piros. 

NERGAL, the name of a solar deity in Babylonia, the main 
seat of whose cult was at Kutha or Cuthah, represented by the 
mound of Tell-Ibrahim. The importance of Kutha as a religious 
and at one time also as a political centre led to his surviving the 
tendency to concentrate the various sun-cults of Babylonia in 
Shamash (q.v.). He becomes, however, the representative of 
a certain phase only of the sun and not of the sun as a whole. 
Portrayed in hymns and myths as a god of war and pestilence, 
there can be little doubt that Nergal represents the sun of noon- 
time and of the summer solstice which brings destruction to man- 
kind. It is a logical consequence that Nergal is pictured also as the 
deity who presides over the nether-world, and stands at the head 
of the special pantheon assigned to the government of the dead, 
who are supposed to be gathered in a large subterranean cave 
known as Aralu or Irkalla. In this capacity there is associated 
with him a goddess Allatu, though there are indications that at 
one time Allatu was regarded as the sole mistress of Aralu, ruling 



NERI, PHILIP

in her own person. Ordinarily the consort of Nergal is Laz. 
Nergal was pictured as a lion and on boundary-stone monuments 
his symbol is a mace surmounted by the head of a lion. 

As in the case of Ninib, Nergal appears to have absorbed 
a number of minor solar deities, which accounts for the various 
names or designations under which he appears, such as Lugalgira, 
Sharrapu (" the burner," perhaps a mere epithet), Ira, Gibil 
(though this name more properly belongs to Nusku, q.v.) and 
Sibitti. A certain confusion exists in cuneiform literature 
between Ninib and Nergal, perhaps due to the traces of two 
different conceptions regarding these two solar deities. Nergal 
is called the " raging king," the " furious one," and the like, and 
by a play upon his name — separated into three elements Ne-uru- 
gal " lord of the great dwelling " — his position at the head of the 
nether-world pantheon is indicated. In the astral-theological 
system he is the planet Mars, while in ecclesiastical art the great 
lion-
