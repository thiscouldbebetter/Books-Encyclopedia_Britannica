ARLON, the chief town of the Belgian province of Luxemburg, situated on
a hill about 1240 ft. above the sea. Pop. (1904) 10,894. It is a very
ancient town, and in the time of the Romans was called Orolaunum, being
a station on the Antoninian way connecting Reims and Trèves. Authorities
dispute as to the origin of the name, some tracing it to _Ara Lunae_, a
temple of Diana having been erected here, while others more plausibly
derive it from the Celtic words _ar_ (mount) and _lun_ (wooded).
Nowadays the woods have disappeared, and Arlon is chiefly notable for
the extensive views obtainable from the church of St Donat which crowns
the peak. Arlon is no longer fortified. When Vauban by order of Louis
XIV. turned it into a fortress in 1671 great damage was done to the old
Roman wall, the foundations of which were practically intact. In the
local museum are many Roman antiquities collected on the spot, including
several large sculptural stones similar to the celebrated monument at
Igel near Trèves. In the middle ages Arlon was the seat of a powerful
countship (later marquisate), held after 1235 by the dukes of Luxemburg.
As an important strategic position it was several times seized by the
French, e.g. in 1647 and 1651.
