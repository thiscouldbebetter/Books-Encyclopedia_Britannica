ARISTIDES, of Thebes, a Greek painter of the 4th century B.C. He is said
to have excelled in expression. For example, a picture of his
representing a dying mother's fear lest her infant should suck death
from her breast was much celebrated. He also painted one of Alexander's
battles. One of his pictures is said to have been bought by King Attalus
for 100 talents (more than £20,000).
