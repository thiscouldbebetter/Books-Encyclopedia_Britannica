ARGUIN, an island (identified by some writers with Hanno's Cerne), off
the west coast of Africa, a little south of Cape Blanco, in 20° 25' N.,
16° 37' W. It is some 4 m. long by 2½ broad, produces gum-arabic, and is
the seat of a lucrative turtle-fishery. Off the island, which was
discovered by the Portuguese in the 15th century, are extensive and very
dangerous reefs. Arguin was occupied in turn by Portuguese, Dutch,
English and French; and to France it now belongs. The aridity of the
soil and the bad anchorage prevent a permanent settlement. The fishery
is mostly carried on by inhabitants of the Canary Isles. In July 1816
the French frigate "Medusa," which carried officers on their way to
Senegal to take possession of that country for France, was wrecked off
Arguin, 350 lives being lost.
