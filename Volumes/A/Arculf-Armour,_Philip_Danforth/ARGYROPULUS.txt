ARGYROPULUS, or ARGYROPULO, JOHN (c. 1416-1486), Greek humanist, one of
the earliest promoters of the revival of learning in the West, was born
in Constantinople, and became a teacher there, Constantine Lascaris
being his pupil. He then appears to have crossed over to Italy, and
taught in Padua in 1434, being subsequently made rector of the
university. About 1441 he returned to Constantinople, but after its
capture by the Turks, again took refuge in Italy. About 1456 he was
invited to Florence by Cosimo de' Medici, and was there appointed
professor of Greek in the university. In 1471, on the outbreak of the
plague, he removed to Rome, where he continued to act as a teacher of
Greek till his death. Among his scholars were Angelus Politianus and
Johann Reuchlin. His principal works were translations of the following
portions of Aristotle,--_Categoriae, De Interpretatione, Analytica
Posteriora, Physica, De Caelo, De Anima, Metaphysica, Ethica Nicomachea,
Politica_; and an _Expositio Ethicorum Aristotelis_. Several of his
writings exist still in manuscript.
