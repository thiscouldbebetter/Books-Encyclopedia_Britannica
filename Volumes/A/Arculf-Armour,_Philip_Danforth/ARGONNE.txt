ARGONNE, a rocky forest-clad plateau in the north-east of France,
extending along the borders of Lorraine and Champagne, and forming part
of the departments of Ardennes, Meuse and Marne. The Argonne stretches
from S.S.E. to N.N.W., a distance of 63 m. with an average breadth of 19
m., and an average height of 1150 ft. It forms the connecting-link
between the plateaus of Haute Marne and the Ardennes, and is bounded E.
by the Meuse and W. by the Ante and the Aisne, which rises in its
southern plateau. The valleys of the Aire and other rivers traverse it
longitudinally, a fact to which its importance as a bulwark of
north-eastern France is largely due. Of the numerous forests which
clothe both slopes of the plateau, the chief is that of Argonne, which
extends for 25 m. between the Aire and the Aisne.
