ARIES ("The Ram"), in astronomy, the first sign of the zodiac (q.v.),
denoted by the sign [symbol], in imitation of a ram's head. The name is
probably to be associated with the fact that when the sun is in this
part of the heavens (in spring) sheep bring forth their young; this
finds a parallel in _Aquarius_, when there is much rain. It is also a
constellation, mentioned by Eudoxus (4th century B.C.) and Aratus (3rd
century B.C.); Ptolemy catalogued eighteen stars, Tycho Brahe
twenty-one, and Hevelius twenty-seven. According to a Greek myth,
Nephele, mother of Phrixus and Helle, gave her son a ram with a golden
fleece. To avoid the evil designs of Hera, their stepmother, Phrixus and
Helle fled on the back of the ram, and reaching the sea, attempted to
cross. Helle fell from the ram and was drowned (hence the _Hellespont_);
Phrixus, having arrived in Colchis and been kindly received by the king,
Aeetes, sacrificed the ram to Zeus, to whom he also dedicated the
fleece, which was afterwards carried away by Jason. Zeus placed the ram
in the heavens as the constellation.
