ARISTOTLE (384-322 B.C.), the great Greek philosopher, was born at
Stagira, on the Strymonic Gulf, and hence called "the Stagirite."
Dionysius of Halicarnassus, in his _Epistle on Demosthenes and
Aristotle_ (chap. 5), gives the following sketch of his life:--Aristotle
([Greek: Aristotelaes]) was the son of Nicomachus, who traced back his
descent and his art to Machaon, son of Aesculapius; his mother being
Phaestis, a descendant of one of those who carried the colony from
Chalcis to Stagira. He was born in the 99th Olympiad in the archonship
at Athens of Diotrephes (384-383), three years before Demosthenes. In
the archonship of Polyzelus (367-366), after the death of his father, in
his eighteenth year, he came to Athens, and having joined Plato spent
twenty years with him. On the death of Plato (May 347) in the archonship
of Theophilus (348-347) he departed to Hermias, tyrant of Atarneus, and,
after three years' stay, during the archonship of Eubulus (345-344) he
moved to Mitylene, whence he went to Philip of Macedon in the archonship
of Pythodotus (343-342), and spent eight years with him as tutor of
Alexander. After the death of Philip (336), in the archonship of
Euaenetus (335-334), he returned to Athens and kept a school in the
Lyceum for twelve years. In the thirteenth, after the death of Alexander
(June 323) in the archonship of Cephisodorus (323-322), having departed
to Chalcis, he died of disease (322), after a life of three-and-sixty
years.

I. ARISTOTLE'S LIFE

This account is practically repeated by Diogenes Laertius in his _Life
of Aristotle_, on the authority of the _Chronicles_ of Apollodorus, who
lived in the 2nd century B.C. Starting then from this tradition, near
enough to the time, we can confidently divide Aristotle's career into
four periods: his youth under his parents till his eighteenth year; his
philosophical education under Plato at Athens till his thirty-eighth
year; his travels in the Greek world till his fiftieth year; and his
philosophical teaching in the Lyceum till his departure to Chalcis and
his death in his sixty-third year. But when we descend from generals to
particulars, we become less certain, and must here content ourselves
with few details.

Aristotle from the first profited by having a father who, being
physician to Amyntas II., king of Macedon, and one of the Asclepiads
who, according to Galen, practised their sons in dissection, both
prepared the way for his son's influence at the Macedonian court, and
gave him a bias to medicine and biology, which certainly led to his
belief in nature and natural science, and perhaps induced him to
practise medicine, as he did, according to his enemies, Timaeus and
Epicurus, when he first went to Athens. At Athens in his second period
for some twenty years he acquired the further advantage of balancing
natural science by metaphysics and morals in the course of reading
Plato's writings and of hearing Plato's unwritten dogmas (cf. [Greek: en
tois legomenois agraphois dogmasin], Ar. _Physics_, iv. 2, 209 b 15,
Berlin ed.). He was an earnest, appreciative, independent student. The
master is said to have called his pupil the intellect of the school and
his house a reader's. He is also said to have complained that his pupil
spurned him as colts do their mothers. Aristotle, however, always
revered Plato's memory (_Nic. Ethics_, i. 6), and even in criticizing
his master counted himself enough of a Platonist to cite Plato's
doctrines as what "we say" (cf. [Greek: phamen], _Metaphysics_, i. 9,
990 b 16). At the same time, he must have learnt much from other
contemporaries at Athens, especially from astronomers such as Eudoxus
and Callippus, and from orators such as Isocrates and Demosthenes. He
also attacked Isocrates, according to Cicero, and perhaps even set up a
rival school of rhetoric. At any rate he had pupils of his own, such as
Eudemus of Cyprus, Theodectes and Hermias, books of his own, especially
dialogues, and even to some extent his own philosophy, while he was
still a pupil of Plato.

Well grounded in his boyhood, and thoroughly educated in his manhood,
Aristotle, after Plato's death, had the further advantage of travel in
his third period, when he was in his prime. The appointment of Plato's
nephew, Speusippus, to succeed his uncle in the Academy induced
Aristotle and Xenocrates to leave Athens together and repair to the
court of Hermias. Aristotle admired Hermias, and married his friend's
sister or niece, Pythias, by whom he had his daughter Pythias. After the
tragic death of Hermias, he retired for a time to Mitylene, and in
343-342 was summoned to Macedon by Philip to teach Alexander, who was
then a boy of thirteen. According to Cicero (_De Oratore_, iii. 41),
Philip wished his son, then a boy of thirteen, to receive from Aristotle
"agendi praecepta et eloquendi." Aristotle is said to have written on
monarchy and on colonies for Alexander; and the pupil is said to have
slept with his master's edition of Homer under his pillow, and to have
respected him, until from hatred of Aristotle's tactless relative,
Callisthenes, who was done to death in 328, he turned at last against
Aristotle himself. Aristotle had power to teach, and Alexander to learn.
Still we must not exaggerate the result. Dionysius must have spoken too
strongly when he says that Aristotle was tutor of Alexander for eight
years; for in 340, when Philip went to war with Byzantium, Alexander
became regent at home, at the age of sixteen. From this date Aristotle
probably spent much time at his paternal house in his native city at
Stagira as a patriotic citizen. Philip had sacked it in 348: Aristotle
induced him or his son to restore it, made for it a new constitution,
and in return was celebrated in a festival after his death. All these
vicissitudes made him a man of the world, drew him out of the
philosophical circle at Athens, and gave him leisure to develop his
philosophy. Besides Alexander he had other pupils: Callisthenes,
Cassander, Marsyas, Phanias, and Theophrastus of Eresus, who is said to
have had land at Stagira. He also continued the writings begun in his
second period; and the Macedonian kings have the glory of having
assisted the Stagirite philosopher with the means of conducting his
researches in the _History of Animals_.

At last, in his fourth period, after the accession of Alexander,
Aristotle at fifty returned to Athens and became the head of his own
school in the Lyceum, a gymnasium near the temple of Apollo Lyceius in
the suburbs. The master and his scholars were called Peripatetics
([Greek: oi ek ton peripaton]), certainly from meeting, like other
philosophical schools, in a walk ([Greek: peripatos]), and perhaps also,
on the authority of Hermippus of Smyrna, from walking and talking there,
like Protagoras and his followers as described in Plato's _Protagoras_
(314 E, 315 C). Indeed, according to Ammonius, Plato too had talked as
he walked in the Academy; and all his followers were called
Peripatetics, until, while the pupils of Xenocrates took the name
"Academics," those of Aristotle retained the general name. Aristotle
also formed his Peripatetic school into a kind of college with common
meals under a president ([Greek: archon]) changing every ten days; while
the philosopher himself delivered lectures, in which his practice, as
his pupil Aristoxenus tells us (_Harmonics_ ii, _init_.), was, avoiding
the generalities of Plato, to prepare his audience by explaining the
subject of investigation and its nature. But Aristotle was an author as
well as a lecturer; for the hypothesis that the Aristotelian writings
are notes of his lectures taken down by his pupils is contradicted by
the tradition of their learning while walking, and disproved by the
impossibility of taking down such complicated discourses from dictation.
Moreover, it is clear that Aristotle addressed himself to readers as
well as hearers, as in concluding his whole theory of syllogisms he
says, "There would remain for all of you or for our hearers ([Greek:
panton umon ae ton aekroamenon]) a duty of according to the defects of
the investigation consideration, to its discoveries much gratitude"
(_Sophisticai Elenchi_, 34,184 b 6). In short, Aristotle was at once a
student, a reader, a lecturer, a writer and a book collector. He was,
says Strabo (608), the first we knew who collected books and taught the
kings in Egypt the arrangement of a library. In his library no doubt
were books of others, but also his own. There we must figure to
ourselves the philosopher, constantly referring to his autograph rolls;
entering references and cross-references; correcting, rewriting,
collecting and arranging them according to their subjects; showing as
well as reading them to his pupils; with little thought of publication,
but with his whole soul concentrated on being and truth.

On his first visit to Athens, during which occurred the fatal battle of
Mantineia (362 B.C.), Aristotle had seen the confusion of Greece
becoming the opportunity of Macedon under Philip; and on his second
visit he was supported at Athens by the complete domination of Macedon
under Alexander. Having witnessed the unjust exactions of a democracy at
Athens, the dwindling population of an oligarchy at Sparta, and the
oppressive selfishness of new tyrannies throughout the Greek world, he
condemned the actual constitutions of the Greek states as deviations
([Greek: parekbaseis]) directed merely to the good of the government;
and he contemplated a right constitution ([Greek: orthae politeia]),
which might be either a commonwealth, an aristocracy or a monarchy,
directed to the general good; but he preferred the monarchy of one man,
pre-eminent in virtue above the rest, as the best of all governments
(_Nicomachean Ethics_, viii. 10; _Politics_, [Gamma] 14-18). Moreover,
by adding (_Politics_, [Eta] 7, 1327 b 29-33) that the Greek race could
govern the world by obtaining one constitution ([Greek: mias tonchanon
politeias]), he indicated some leaning to a universal monarchy under
such a king as Alexander. On the whole, however, he adhered to the Greek
city-state ([Greek: polis]), partly perhaps out of patriotism to his own
Stagira. Averse at all events to the Athenian democracy, leaning towards
Macedonian monarchy, and resting on Macedonian power, he maintained
himself in his school at Athens, so long as he was supported by the
friendship of Antipater, the Macedonian regent in Alexander's absence.
But on Alexander's sudden death in 323, when Athens in the Lamian war
tried to reassert her freedom against Antipater, Aristotle found himself
in danger. He was accused of impiety on the absurd charge of deifying
the tyrant Hermias; and, remembering the fate of Socrates, he retired to
Chalcis in Euboea. There, away from his school, in 322 he died. (A tomb
has been found in our time inscribed with the name of Biote, daughter of
Aristotle. But is this _our_ Aristotle?)

Such is our scanty knowledge of Aristotle's life, which seems to have
been prosperous by inheritance and position, and happy by work and
philosophy. His will, which was quoted by Hermippus, and, as afterwards
quoted by Diogenes Laertius, has come down to us, though perhaps not
complete, supplies some further details, as follows:--Antipater is to be
executor with others. Nicanor is to marry Pythias, Aristotle's daughter,
and to take charge of Nicomachus his son. Theophrastus is to be one of
the executors if he will and can, and if Nicanor should die to act
instead, if he will, in reference to Pythias. The executors and Nicanor
are to take charge of Herpyllis, "because," in the words of the
testator, "she has been good to me," and to allow her to reside either
in the lodging by the garden at Chalcis or in the paternal house at
Stagira. They are to provide for the slaves, who in some cases are to be
freed. They are to see after the dedication of four images by Gryllion
of Nicanor, Proxenus, Nicanor's mother and Arimnestus. They are to
dedicate an image of Aristotle's mother, and to see that the bones of
his wife Pythias are, as she ordered, taken up and buried with him. On
this will we may remark that Proxenus is said to have been Aristotle's
guardian after the death of his father, and to have been the father of
Nicanor; that Herpyllis of Stagira was the mother of Nicomachus by
Aristotle; and that Arimnestus was the brother of Aristotle, who also
had a sister, Arimneste. Every clause breathes the philosopher's
humanity.

II. DEVELOPMENT FROM PLATONISM

Turning now from the man to the philosopher as we know him best in his
extant writings (see _Aristoteles_, ed. Bekker, Berlin, 1831, the pages
of which we use for our quotations), we find, instead of the general
dialogues of Plato, special didactic treatises, and a fundamental
difference of philosophy, so great as to have divided philosophers into
opposite camps, and made Coleridge say that everybody is born either a
Platonist or an Aristotelian. Platonism is the doctrine that the
individuals we call things only become, but a thing is always one
universal form beyond many individuals, e.g. one good beyond seeming
goods; and that without supernatural forms, which are models of
individuals, there is nothing, no being, no knowing, no good.
Aristotelianism is the contrary doctrine: a thing is always a separate
individual, a _substance_ ([Greek: ousia]), natural such as earth or
supernatural such as God; and without these individual substances, which
have attributes and universals belonging to them, there is nothing, to
be, to know, to be good. Philosophic differences are best felt by their
practical effects: philosophically, Platonism is a philosophy of
universal forms, Aristotelianism a philosophy of individual substances:
practically, Plato makes us think first of the supernatural and the
kingdom of heaven, Aristotle of the natural and the whole world.

So diametrical a difference could not have arisen at once. For, though
Aristotle was different from Plato, and brought with him from Stagira a
Greek and Ionic but colonial origin, a medical descent and tendency, and
a matter-of-fact worldly kind of character, nevertheless on coming to
Athens as pupil of Plato he must have begun with his master's
philosophy. What then in more detail was the philosophy which the pupil
learnt from the master? When Aristotle at the age of eighteen came to
Athens, Plato, at the age of sixty-two, had probably written all his
dialogues except the _Laws_; and in the course of the remaining twenty
years of his life and teaching, he expounded "the so-called unwritten
dogmas" in his lectures on the Good. There was therefore a written
Platonism for Aristotle to read, and an unwritten Platonism which he
actually heard.

To begin with the written philosophy of the Dialogues. Individual
so-called things neither are nor are not, but become: the real thing is
always one universal form beyond the many individuals, e.g. the one
beautiful beyond all beautiful individuals; and each form ([Greek:
idea]) is a model which causes individuals by participation to become
like, but not the same as, itself. Above all forms stands the form of
the good, which is the cause of all other forms being, and through them
of all individuals becoming. The creator, or the divine intellect, with
a view to the form of the good, and taking all forms as models, creates
in a receptacle ([Greek: hypodochae], Plato, _Timaeus_, 49 A) individual
impressions which are called things but really change and become without
attaining the permanence of being. Knowledge resides not in sense but in
reason, which, on the suggestion of sensations of changing individuals,
apprehends, or (to be precise) is reminded of, real universal forms,
and, by first ascending from less to more general until it arrives at
the form of good and then descending from this unconditional principle
to the less general, becomes science and philosophy, using as its method
the dialectic which gives and receives questions and answers between man
and man. Happiness in this world consists proximately in virtue as a
harmony between the three parts, rational, spirited and appetitive, of
our souls, and ultimately in living according to the form of the good;
but there is a far higher happiness, when the immortal soul, divesting
itself of body and passions and senses, rises from earth to heaven and
contemplates pure forms by pure reason. Such in brief is the Platonism
of the written dialogues; where the main doctrine of forms is
confessedly advanced never as a dogma but always as a hypothesis, in
which there are difficulties, but without which Plato can explain
neither being, nor truth nor goodness, because throughout he denies the
being of individual things. In the unwritten lectures of his old age, he
developed this formal into a mathematical metaphysics. In order to
explain the unity and variety of the world, the one universal form and
the many individuals, and how the one good is the main cause of
everything, he placed as it were at the back of his own doctrine of
forms a Pythagorean mathematical philosophy. He supposed that the one
and the two, which is indeterminate, and is the great and little, are
opposite principles or causes. Identifying the form of the good with the
one, he supposed that the one, by combining with the indeterminate two,
causes a plurality of forms, which like every combination of one and two
are numbers but peculiar in being incommensurate with one another, so
that each form is not a mathematical number ([Greek: mathaematikos
arithmos]), but a formal number ([Greek: eidaetikos arithmos]). Further
he supposed that in its turn each form, or formal number, is a limited
one which, by combining again with the indeterminate two, causes a
plurality of individuals. Hence finally he concluded that the good as
the one combining with the indeterminate two is directly the cause of
all forms as formal numbers, and indirectly through them all of the
multitude of individuals in the world.

Aristotle knew Plato, was present at his lectures on the Good, wrote a
report of them ([Greek: peri tagathou]), and described this latter
philosophy of Plato in his _Metaphysics_. Modern critics, who were not
present and knew neither, often accuse Aristotle of misrepresenting
Plato. But Heracleides and Hestiacus, Speusippus and Xenocrates were
also present and wrote similar reports. What is more, both Speusippus
and Xenocrates founded their own philosophies on this very
Pythagoreanism of Plato. Speusippus as president of the Academy from 347
to 339 taught that the one and the many are principles, while abolishing
forms and reducing the good from cause to effect. Xenocrates as
president from 339 onwards taught that the one and many are principles,
only without distinguishing mathematical from formal numbers.
Aristotle's critics hardly realize that for the rest of his life he had
to live and to struggle with a formal and a mathematical Platonism,
which exaggerated first universals and attributes and afterwards the
quantitative attributes, one and many, into substantial things and real
causes.

Aristotle had no sympathy with the unwritten dogmas of Plato. But with
the written dialogues of Plato he always continued to agree almost as
much as he disagreed. Like Plato, he believed in real universals, real
essences, real causes; he believed in the unity of the universal, and in
the immateriality of essences; he believed in the good, and that there
is a good of the universe; he believed that God is a living being,
eternal and best, who is a supernatural cause of the motions and changes
of the natural world, and that essences and matter are also necessary
causes; he believed in the divine intelligence and in the immortality of
our intelligent souls; he believed in knowledge going from sense to
reason, that science requires ascent to principles and is descent from
principles, and that dialectic is useful to science; he believed in
happiness involving virtue, and in moral virtue being a control of
passions by reason, while the highest happiness is speculative wisdom.
All these inspiring metaphysical and moral doctrines the pupil accepted
from his master's dialogues, and throughout his life adhered to the
general spirit of realism without materialism pervading the Platonic
philosophy. But what he refused to believe with Plato was that reality
is not here, but only above; and what he maintained against Plato was
that it is both, and that universals and forms, one and many, the good,
are real but not separate realities. This deep metaphysical divergence
was the prime cause of the transition from Platonism to Aristotelianism.

_Fragmenta Aristotelis._--Aristotle's originality soon asserted itself
in early writings, of which fragments have come down to us, and have
been collected by Rose (see the Berlin edition of Aristotle's works, or
more readily in the Teubner series, which we shall use for our
quotations). Many, no doubt, are spurious; but some are genuine, and a
few perhaps cited in Aristotle's extant works. Some are dialogues,
others didactic works. A special interest attaches to the dialogues
written after the manner of Plato but with Aristotle as principal
interlocutor; and some of these, e.g. the [Greek: peri poiaeton] and the
_Eudemus_, seem to have been published. It is not always certain which
were dialogues, which didactic like Aristotle's later works; but by
comparing those which were certainly dialogues with their companions in
the list of Aristotle's books as given by Diogenes Laertius, we may
conclude with Bernays that the books occurring first in that list were
dialogues. Hence we may perhaps accept as genuine the following:--

  1. Dialogues:--
      [Greek: peri dikaiosunaes]: On justice.
      [Greek: peri poiaeton]: On poets (perhaps cited in _Poetics_, 15,
        1454 b 18, [Greek: en tois ekdekomenois logois]).
      [Greek: peri philosophias]: On philosophy (perhaps cited in
        _Physics_, ii. 2, 194 a 35-36).
      [Greek: peri politikou]: A politician.
      [Greek: peri rhaetorikaes hae Grullos]: On rhetoric.
      [Greek: protreptikos]: An exhortation to philosophy (probably in
        dialogue, because it is the model of Cicero's dialogue
        _Hortensius_).
      [Greek: Eudaemos hae peri Psuchaes]: On soul (perhaps cited in _De
        Anima_, i. 4, 407 b 29, [Greek: kai tois en koino levomenois
        logois]).

  2. Didactic writings:--
    (1) Metaphysical:--
      [Greek: peri tagathou]: On the good (probably not a dialogue but a
        report of Plato's lectures).
      [Greek: peri ideon]: On forms.
    (2) Political:--
      [Greek: peri basileias]: On monarchy.
      [Greek: Alexandros hae hyper apoikon]: On colonies.
    (3) Rhetorical:--
      [Greek: technaes taes theodektou sunagogae]: The _Theodectea_
        (cited in the Preface to the _Rhetoric to Alexander_ (chap.
        i.)), and as [Greek: ta theodekteia] in the _Rhetoric_ (iii. 9,
        1410 b 2),
      [Greek: technon sunagogae]: A historical collection of arts of
        rhetoric.

Difficult as it is to determine when Aristotle wrote all these various
works, some of them indicate their dates. Gryllus, celebrated in the
dialogue on rhetoric, was Xenophon's son who fell at Mantineia in 362;
and Eudemus of Cyprus, lamented in the dialogue on soul, died in Sicily
in 352. These then were probably written before Plato died in 347; and
so probably were most of the dialogues, precisely because they were
imitations of the dialogues of Plato. Among the didactic writings, the
[Greek: peri tagathou] would probably belong to the same time, because
it was Aristotle's report of Plato's lectures. On the other hand, the
two political works, if written for Alexander, would be after 343-342
when Philip made Aristotle his tutor. So probably were the rhetorical
works, especially the _Theodectea_; since both politics and oratory were
the subjects which the father wanted the tutor to teach his son, and,
when Alexander came to Phaselis, he is said by Plutarch (_Alexander_,
17) to have decorated the statue of Theodectes in honour of his
association with the man through Aristotle and philosophy. On the whole,
then, it seems as if Aristotle began with dialogues during his second
period under Plato, but gradually came to prefer writing didactic works,
especially in the third period after Plato's death, and in connexion
with Alexander.

These early writings show clearly how Aristotle came to depart from
Plato. In the first place as regards style, though the Stagirite pupil
Aristotle could never rival his Attic master in literary form, yet he
did a signal service to philosophy in gradually passing from the vague
generalities of the dialogue to the scientific precision of the didactic
treatise. The philosophy of Plato is dialogue trying to become science;
that of Aristotle science retaining traces of dialectic. Secondly as
regards subject-matter, even in his early writings Aristotle tends to
widen the scope of philosophic inquiry, so as not only to embrace
metaphysics and politics, but also to encourage rhetoric and poetics,
which Plato tended to discourage or limit. Thirdly as regards doctrines,
the surpassing interest of these early writings is that they show the
pupil partly agreeing, partly disagreeing, with his master. The
_Eudemus_ and _Protrepticus_ are with Plato; the dialogues _on
Philosophy_ and the treatise _on Forms_ are against Plato.

  The _Eudemus_, on the soul (_Fragmenta_, 37 seq.), must have been in
  style and thought the most Platonic of all the Aristotelian writings.
  Plato's theory of the soul and its immortality was not the ordinary
  Greek view derived from Homer, who regarded the body as the self, the
  soul as a shade having a future state but an obscure existence, and
  stamped that view on the hearts of his countrymen, and affected
  Aristotle himself. After Homer there had come to Greece the new view
  that the soul is more real than the body, that it is imprisoned in the
  carcase as a prison-house, that it is capable of enjoying a happier
  life freed from the body, and that it can transmigrate from body to
  body. This strange, exotic, ascetic view was adopted by some
  philosophers, and especially by the Pythagoreans, and so transmitted
  to Plato. Aristotle in the _Eudemus_, written about 352, when he was
  thirty-two, also believed in it. Accordingly, the soul of Eudemus,
  when it left his body, is said to be returning home: the soul is made
  subject to the casting of lots, and in coming from the other world to
  this it is supposed to forget its former visions: but its disembodied
  life is regarded as its natural life in a better world. The _Eudemus_
  also contained a celebrated passage, preserved by Plutarch (_Consolat.
  ad Apoll._.27; _Fragm._ 44). Here we can read the young Aristotle,
  writing in the form of the dialogue like Plato, avoiding hiatus like
  Isocrates, and justifying the praises accorded to his style by Cicero,
  Quintilian and Dionysius. It shows how nearly the pupil could imitate
  his master's dialogues, and still more how exactly he at first
  embraced his master's doctrines. It makes Silenus, captured by Midas,
  say that the best of all things is not to have been born, and the next
  best, having been born, to die as soon as possible. Nothing could be
  more like Plato's _Phaedo_, or more unlike Aristotle's later work _on
  the Soul_, which entirely rejects transmigration and allows the next
  life to sink into the background.

  Hardly less Platonic is the _Protrepticus_ (_Fragm._ 50 seq.), an
  exhortation to philosophy which, according to Zeno the Stoic, was
  studied by his master Crates. It is an exhortation, whose point is
  that the chief good is philosophy, the contemplation of the universe
  by divine and immortal intellect. This is indeed a doctrine of
  Platonic ethics from which Aristotle in his later days never swerved.
  But in the _Protrepticus_ he goes on to say that seeming goods, such
  as strength, size, beauty, honours, opinions, are mere illusion
  ([Greek: okiagraphia]), worthless and ridiculous, as we should know if
  we had Lyncean eyes to compare them with the vision of the eternal.
  This indifference to goods of body and estate is quite Platonic, but
  is very different from Aristotle's later ethical doctrine that such
  goods, though not the essence, are nevertheless necessary conditions
  of happiness. Finally, in the spirit of Plato's _Phaedo_ and the
  dialogue _Eudemus_, the _Protrepticus_ holds that the soul is bound to
  the sentient members of the body as prisoners in Etruria are bound
  face to face with corpses; whereas the later view of the _De Anima_ is
  that the soul is the vital principle of the body and the body the
  necessary organ of the soul.

  Thus we find that at first, under the influence of his master,
  Aristotle held somewhat ascetic views on soul and body and on goods of
  body and estate, entirely opposed both in psychology and in ethics to
  the moderate doctrines of his later writings. This perhaps is one
  reason why Cicero, who had Aristotle's early writings, saw no
  difference between the Academy and the Peripatetics (_Acad. Post_, i.
  4, 17-18).

  On the other hand, the dialogue _on Philosophy_ ([Greek: peri
  philosophias], _Fragm._ 1 seq.) strikingly exhibits the origin of
  Aristotle's divergence from Platonism, and that too in Plato's
  lifetime. The young son of a doctor from the colonies proved too fond
  of this world to stomach his Athenian master's philosophy of the
  supernatural. Accordingly in this dialogue he attacked Plato's
  fundamental position, both in its written and in its unwritten
  presentment, as a hypothesis both of forms and of formal numbers.
  First, he attacked the hypothesis of forms ([Greek: taen ton ideon
  hypothesin], _Fragm._ 8), exclaiming in his dialogues, according to
  Proclus, that he could not sympathize with the dogma even if it should
  be thought that he was opposing it out of contentiousness; while
  Plutarch says that his attacks on the forms by means of his exoteric
  dialogues were thought by some persons more contentious than
  philosophical, as presuming to disdain Plato's philosophy: so far was
  he, says Plutarch, from following it. Secondly, in the same dialogue
  (_Fragm._ 9), according to Syrianus, he disagreed with the hypothesis
  of formal numbers ([Greek: tois eidaetikois arithmois]). If, wrote
  Aristotle, the forms are another sort of number, not mathematical,
  there would be no understanding of it. Lastly, in the same dialogue
  (_Fragm._ 18 seq.) he revealed his emphasis on nature by contending
  that the universe is uncreate and indestructible. According to Plato,
  God caused the natural world to become: according to Aristotle it is
  eternal. This eternity of the world became one of his characteristic
  doctrines, and subsequently enabled him to explain how essences can be
  eternal without being separate from this world which is also eternal
  (cf. _Metaph._ [Zeta] 8). Thus early did Aristotle begin, even in
  Plato's lifetime, to oppose Plato's hypothesis of supernatural forms,
  and advance his own hypothesis of the eternity of the world.

  He made another attack on Platonism in the didactic work [Greek: peri
  ideon], (_Fragm._ 185 seq.), contending that the Platonic arguments
  prove not forms ([Greek: ideai]) but only things common ([Greek: ta
  koina]). Here, according to Alexander the commentator, he first
  brought against Plato the argument of "the third man" ([Greek: ho
  tritos anthropos]); that, if there is the form, one man beyond many
  men, there will be a third man predicated of both man and men, and a
  fourth predicated of all three, and so on to infinity (_Fragm._ 188).
  Here, too, he examined the hypothesis of Eudoxus that things are
  caused by mixture of forms, a hypothesis which formed a kind of
  transition to his own later views, but failed to satisfy him on
  account of its difficulties. Lastly, in the didactic work [Greek: peri
  tagathou] (_Fragm._ 27 seq.), containing his report of Plato's
  lectures on the Good, he was dealing with the same mathematical
  metaphysics which in his dialogue _on Philosophy_ he criticized for
  converting forms into formal numbers. Aristoxenus, at the beginning of
  the second book of the _Harmonics_, gives a graphic account of the
  astonishment caused by these lectures of Plato, and of their effect on
  the lectures of Aristotle. In contending, as Aristotle's pupil, that a
  teacher should begin by proposing his subject, he tells us how
  Aristotle used to relate that most of Plato's hearers came expecting
  to get something about human goods and happiness, but that when the
  discourses turned out to be all about mathematics, with the conclusion
  that good is one, it appeared to them a paradox, which some despised
  and others condemned. The reason, he adds, was that they were not
  informed by Plato beforehand; and for this very reason, Aristotle, as
  he told Aristoxenus himself, used to prepare his hearers by informing
  them of the nature of the subject. From this rare personal
  reminiscence we see at a glance that the mind of Plato and the mind of
  Aristotle were so different, that their philosophies must diverge; the
  one towards the supernatural, the abstract, the discursive, and the
  other towards the natural, the substantial, the scientific.

  Aristotle then even in the second period of his life, while Plato was
  still alive, began to differ from him in metaphysics. He rejected the
  Platonic hypothesis of forms, and affirmed that they are not separate
  but common, without however as yet having advanced to a constructive
  metaphysics of his own; while at the same time, after having at first
  adopted his master's dialectical treatment of metaphysical problems,
  he soon passed from dialogues to didactic works, which had the result
  of separating metaphysics from dialectic. The all-important
  consequence of this first departure from Platonism was that Aristotle
  became and remained primarily a metaphysician. After Plato's death,
  coming to his third period he made a further departure from Platonism
  in his didactic works on politics and rhetoric, written in connexion
  with Alexander and Theodectes. Those on politics (_Fragm._ 646-648)
  were designed to instruct Alexander on monarchy and on colonization;
  and in them Aristotle agreed with Plato in assigning a moral object to
  the state, but departed from him by saying that a king need not be a
  philosopher, as Plato had said in the _Republic_, but does need to
  listen to philosophers. Still more marked was his departure from Plato
  as regards rhetoric. Plato in the _Gorgias_, (501 [Alpha]) had
  contended that rhetoric is not an art but an empirical practice
  ([Greek: tribae kai empeiria]); Aristotle in the _Gryllus_ (_Fragm._
  68-69), written in his second period, took according to Quintilian a
  similar view. But in his third period, in the _Theodectea_ (_Fragm._
  125 seq.), rhetoric is treated as an art, and is laid out somewhat in
  the manner of his later _Art of Rhetoric_; while he also showed his
  interest in the subject by writing a history of other arts of rhetoric
  called [Greek: technon ounagogae] (_Fragm._ 136 seq.). Further, in
  treating rhetoric as an art in the _Theodectea_ he was forced into a
  conclusion, which carried him far beyond Plato's rigid notions of
  proof and of passion: he concluded that it is the work of an orator to
  use persuasion, and to arouse the passions ([Greek: to ta pathae
  diageirai]), e.g. anger and pity (_ib._ 133-134). Nor could he treat
  poetry as he is said to have done without the same result.

On the whole then, in his early dialectical and didactic writings, of
which mere fragments remain, Aristotle had already diverged from Plato,
and first of all in metaphysics. During his master's life, in the second
period of his own life, he protested against the Platonic hypothesis of
forms, formal numbers and the one as the good, and tended to separate
metaphysics from dialectic by beginning to pass from dialogues to
didactic works. After his master's death, in the third period of his own
life, and during his connexion with Alexander, but before the final
construction of his philosophy into a system, he was tending to write
more and more in the didactic style; to separate from dialectic, not
only metaphysics, but also politics, rhetoric and poetry; to admit by
the side of philosophy the arts of persuasive language; to think it part
of their legitimate work to rouse the passions; and in all these ways to
depart from the ascetic rigidity of the philosophy of Plato, so as to
prepare for the tolerant spirit of his own, and especially for his
ethical doctrine that virtue consists not in suppressing but in
moderating almost all human passions. In both periods, too, as we shall
find in the sequel, he was already occupied in composing some of the
extant writings which were afterwards to form parts of his final
philosophical system. But as yet he had given no sign of system,
and--what is surprising--no trace of logic. Aristotle was primarily a
metaphysician against Plato; a metaphysician before he was a logician; a
metaphysician who made what he called primary philosophy ([Greek: protae
philosophia]) the starting-point of his philosophical development, and
ultimately of his philosophical system.

III. COMPOSITION OF HIS EXTANT WORKS

The system which was taught by Aristotle at Athens in the fourth period
of his life, and which is now known as the Aristotelian philosophy, is
contained not in fragments but in extant books. It will be best then to
give at once a list of these extant works, following the traditional
order in which they have long been arranged, and marking with a dagger
([+]) those which are now usually considered not to be genuine, though
not always with sufficient reason.

  A. LOGICAL

  signifying different kinds of things and capable of predication
  [probably an early work of Aristotle, accepting species and genera as
  "secondary substances" in deference to Plato's teaching].

  2. [Greek: peri Hermaeneias]: _De interpretatione_: On language as
  expression of mind, and especially on the enunciation or assertion
  ([Greek: apophansis, apophantikos logos]) [rejected by Andronicus
  according to Alexander; but probably an early work of Aristotle, based
  on Plato's analysis of the sentence into noun and verb].

  3. [Greek: Analytika protera]: _Analytica Priora_, On syllogism, with
  a view to demonstration.

  4. [Greek: Analytika ustera]: _Analytica Posteriora_: On

  G. HISTORICAL

  [Greek: Athaenaion politeia:] _De republica Atheniensium_: On the

  been 158 at least, the genuineness of which is attested by the defence
  which Polybius (xii.) makes of Aristotle's history of the Epizephyrian
  Locrians against Timaeus, Aristotle's contemporary and critic.
  Hitherto, only fragments have come down to us (cf. _Fragm_. 381-603).
  The present treatise, without however its beginning and end, written
  on a papyrus discovered in Egypt and now in the British Museum, was
  first edited by F.G. Kenyon 1890-1891.] (See the article CONSTITUTION
  OF ATHENS.)

_The Difficulty._--The genuineness of the Aristotelian works, as
Leibnitz truly said (_De Stilo Phil. Nizolii_, xxx.), is ascertained by
the conspicuous harmony of their theories, and by their uniform method
of swift subtlety. Nevertheless difficulties lurk beneath their general
unity of thought and style. In style they are not quite the same: now
they are brief and now diffuse: sometimes they are carelessly written,
sometimes so carefully as to avoid hiatus, e.g. the _Metaphysics_ A, and
parts of the _De Coelo_ and _Parva Naturalia_, which in this respect
resemble the fragment quoted by Plutarch from the early dialogue
_Eudemus_ (_Fragm_. 44). They also appear to contain displacements,
interpolations, prefaces such as that to the _Meteorologica_, and
appendices such as that to the _Sophistical Elenchi_, which may have
been added. An Aristotelian work often goes on continuously at first,
and then becomes disappointing by suddenly introducing discussions which
break the connexion or are even inconsistent with the beginning; as in
the _Posterior Analytics_, which, after developing a theory of
demonstration from necessary principles, suddenly makes the admission,
which is also the main theory of science in the _Metaphysics_, that
demonstration is about either the necessary or the contingent, from
principles either necessary or contingent, only not accidental. At times
order is followed by disorder, as in the _Politics_. Again, there are
repetitions and double versions, e.g. those of the _Physics_, vii., and
those of the _De Anima_, ii., discovered by Torstrik; or two discussions
of the same subject, e.g. of pleasure in the _Nicomachean Ethics_, vii.
and x.; or several treatises on the same subject very like one another,
viz. the _Nicomachean Ethics_, the _Eudemian Ethics_ and the _Magna
Moralia_; or, strangest of all, a consecutive treatise and other
discourses amalgamated, e.g. in the _Metaphysics_, where a systematic
theory of being running through several books ( [Beta, Gamma, Epsilon,
Zeta, Eta, Theta]) is preceded, interrupted and followed by other
discussions of the subject. Further, there are frequently several titles
of the same work or of different parts of it. Sometimes diagrams
([Greek: diagraphai] or [Greek: hypographai]) are mentioned, and
sometimes given (e.g. in _De Interp_. 13, 22 a 22; _Nicomachean Ethics_,
ii. 7; _Eudemian Ethics_, ii. 3), but sometimes only implied (e.g. in
_Hist. An._ i. 17, 497 a 32; iii. 1, 510 a 30; iv. 1, 525 a 9). The
different works are more or less connected by a system of references,
which give rise to difficulties, especially when they are
cross-references: for example, the _Analytics_ and _Topics_ quote one
another: so do the _Physics_ and the _Metaphysics_; the _De Vita_ and
_De Respiratione_ and the _De Partibus Animalium_; this latter treatise
and the _De Animalium Incessu_; the _De Interpretatione_ and the _De
Anima_. A late work may quote an earlier; but how, it may be asked, can
the earlier reciprocally quote the later?

Besides these difficulties in and between the works there are others
beyond them. On the one hand, there is the curious story given partly by
Strabo (608-609) and partly in Plutarch's _Sulla_ (c. 26), that
Aristotle's successor Theophrastus left the books of both to their joint
pupil, Neleus of Scepsis, where they were hidden in a cellar, till in
Sulla's time they were sold to Apellicon, who made new copies,
transferred after Apellicon's death by Sulla to Rome, and there edited
and published by Tyrannio and Andronicus. On the other hand, there are
the curious and puzzling catalogues of Aristotelian books, one given by
Diogenes Laertius, another by an anonymous commentator (perhaps
Hesychius of Miletus) quoted in the notes of Gilles Ménage on Diogenes
Laertius, and known as "Anonymus Menagii," and a third copied by two
Arabian writers from Ptolemy, perhaps King Ptolemy Philadelphus, son of
the founder of the library at Alexandria. (See Rose, _Fragm_. pp. 1-22.)
But the extraordinary thing is that, without exactly agreeing among
themselves, the catalogues give titles which do not agree well with the
Aristotelian works as we have them. A title in some cases suits a given
work or a part of it; but in other cases there are no titles for works
which exist, or titles for works which do not exist.

These difficulties are complicated by various hypotheses concerning the
composition of the Aristotelian works. Zeller supposes that, though
Aristotle may have made preparations for his philosophical system
beforehand, still the properly didactic treatises composing it almost
all belong to the last period of his life, i.e. from 335-334 to 322; and
from the references of one work to another Zeller has further suggested
a chronological order of composition during this period of twelve years,
beginning with the treatises on Logic and Physics, and ending with that
on Metaphysics. There is a further hypothesis that the Aristotelian
works were not originally treatises, but notes of lectures either for or
by his pupils. This easily passes into the further and still more
sceptical hypothesis that the works, as we have them, under Aristotle's
name, are rather the works of the Peripatetic school, from Aristotle,
Theophrastus and Eudemus downwards. "We cannot assert with certainty,"
says R. Shute in his _History of the Aristotelian Writings_ (p. 176),
"that we have even got throughout a treatise in the exact words of
Aristotle, though we may be pretty clear that we have a fair
representation of his thought. The unity of style observable may belong
quite as much to the school and the method as to the individual." This
sceptical conclusion, the contrary of that drawn by Leibnitz from the
harmony of thought and style pervading the works, shows us that the
Homeric question has been followed by the Aristotelian question.

_The Solution._--Such hypotheses attend to Aristotle's philosophy to the
neglect of his life. He was really, as we have seen, a prolific writer
from the time when he was a young man under Plato's guidance at Athens;
beginning with dialogues in the manner of his master, but afterwards
preferring to write didactic works during the prime of his own life
between thirty-eight and fifty (347-335-334), and with the further
advantage of leisure at Atarneus and Mitylene, in Macedonia and at home
in Stagira. When at fifty he returned to Athens, as head of the
Peripatetic school, he no doubt wrote much of his extant philosophy
during the twelve remaining years of his life (335-322). But he was then
a busy teacher, was growing old, and suffered from a disease in the
stomach for a considerable time before it proved fatal at the age of
sixty-three. It is therefore improbable that he could between fifty and
sixty-three have written almost the whole of the many books on many
subjects constituting that grand philosophical system which is one of
the most wonderful works of man. It is far more probable that he was
previously composing them at his leisure and in the vigour of manhood,
precisely as his contemporary Demosthenes composed all his great
speeches except the _De Corona_ before he was fifty.

Turning to Aristotle's own works, we immediately light upon a surprise:
Aristotle began his extant scientific works during Plato's lifetime. By
a curious coincidence, in two different works he mentions two different
events as contemporary with the time of writing, one in 357 and the
other in 356. In the _Politics_ ([Epsilon] 10, 1312 b 10), he mentions
as now ([Greek: nun]) Dion's expedition to Sicily which occurred in 357.
In the _Meteorologica_ (iii. 1, 371 a 30), he mentions as now ([Greek:
nun]) the burning of the temple at Ephesus, which occurred in 356. To
save his hypothesis of late composition, Zeller resorts to the vagueness
of the word "now" ([Greek: nun]). But Aristotle is graphically
describing isolated events, and could hardly speak of events of 357 and
356 as happening "now" in or near 335. Moreover, these two works contain
further proofs that they were both begun earlier than this date. The
_Politics_ ([Beta] 10) mentions as having happened lately ([Greek:
neosti]) the expedition of Phalaecus to Crete, which occurred towards
the end of the Sacred War in 346. The _Meteorologica_ ([Gamma] 7)
mentions the comet of 341. It is true that the _Politics_ also mentions
much later events, e.g. the assassination of Philip which took place in
336 ([Epsilon] 10, 1311 b 1-3). Indeed, the whole truth about this great
work is that it remained unfinished at Aristotle's death. But what of
that? The logical conclusion is that Aristotle began writing it as early
as 357, and continued writing it in 346, in 336, and so on till he died.
Similarly, he began the _Meteorologica_ as early as 356 and was still
writing it in 341. Both books were commenced some years before Plato's
death: both were works of many years: both were destined to form parts
of the Aristotelian system of philosophy. It follows that Aristotle,
from early manhood, not only wrote dialogues and didactic works,
surviving only in fragments, but also began some of the philosophical
works which are still parts of his extant writings. He continued these
and no doubt began others during the prime of his life. Having thus
slowly matured his separate writings, he was the better able to combine
them more and more into a system, in his last years. No doubt, however,
he went on writing and rewriting well into the last period of his life;
for example, the recently discovered [Greek: Athaenaion politeia]
mentions on the one hand (c. 54) the archonship of Cephisophon
(329-328), on the other hand (c. 46) triremes and quadriremes but
without quinqueremes, which first appeared at Athens in 325-324; and as
it mentions nothing later it probably received its final touches between
320 and 324. But it may have been begun long before, and received
additions and changes. However early Aristotle began a book, so long as
he kept the manuscript, he could always change it. Finally he died
without completing some of his works, such as the _Politics_, and
notably that work of his whole philosophic career and foundation of his
whole philosophy--the _Metaphysics_--which, projected in his early
criticism of Plato's philosophy of universal forms, gradually developed
into his positive philosophy of individual substances, but remained
unfinished after all.

On the whole, then, Aristotle was writing his extant works very
gradually for some thirty-five years (357-322), like Herodotus (iv. 30)
contemplated additions, continued writing them more or less together,
not so much successively as simultaneously, and had not finished writing
at his death.

There is a curious characteristic connected with this gradual
composition. An Aristotelian treatise frequently has the appearance of
being a collection of smaller discourses ([Greek: logoi]), as, e.g.,
K.L. Michelet has remarked.

This is obvious enough in the _Metaphysics_: it has two openings (Books
[Alpha] and [alpha]); then comes a nearly consecutive theory of being
([Beta], [Gamma], [Epsilon], [Zeta], [Eta], [Theta]), but interrupted by
a philosophical lexicon [Delta]; afterwards follows a theory of unity
([Iota]); then a summary of previous books and of doctrines from the
_Physics_ ([Kappa]); next a new beginning about being, and, what is
wanted to complete the system, a theory of God in relation to the world
([Lambda]); finally a criticism of mathematical metaphysics ([Mu],
[Nu]), in which the argument against Plato ([Alpha] 9) is repeated
almost word for word ([Mu] 4-5). The _Metaphysics_ is clearly a
compilation formed from essays or discourses; and it illustrates another
characteristic of Aristotle's gradual method of composition. It refers
back to passages "in the first discourses" ([Greek: en tois protois
logois]) --an expression not uncommon in Aristotelian writings.
Sometimes the reference is to the beginning of the whole treatise; e.g.
_Met_. [Beta] 2, 997 b 3-5, referring back to [Alpha] 6 and 9 about
Platonic forms. Sometimes, on the other hand, the reference only goes
back to a previous part of a given topic, e.g. _Met_. [Theta] 1, 1045 b
27-32, referring back to [Zeta] 1, or at the earliest to [Gamma] 2. On
either alternative, however, "the first discourses" mentioned may have
originally been a separate discourse; for Book [Gamma] begins quite
fresh with the definition of the science of being, long afterwards
called "Metaphysics," and Book [Zeta] begins Aristotle's fundamental
doctrine of substance.

Another indication of a treatise having arisen out of separate
discourses is its consisting of different parts imperfectly connected.
Thus the _Nicomachean Ethics_ begins by identifying the good with
happiness ([Greek: eudaimonia]), and happiness with virtuous action. But
when it comes to the moral virtues (Book iii. 6), a new motive of the
"honourable" ([Greek: tou kalou eneka]) is suddenly introduced without
preparation, where one would expect the original motive of happiness.
Then at the end of the moral virtues justice is treated at inordinate
length, and in a different manner from the others, which are regarded as
means between two vices, whereas justice appears as a mean only because
it is of the middle between too much and too little. Later, the
discussion on friendship (Books viii.-ix.) is again inordinate in
length, and it stands alone. Lastly, pleasure, after having been first
defined (Book vii.) as an activity, is treated over again (Book x.) as
an end beyond activity, with a warning against confusing activity and
pleasure. The probability is that the _Nicomachean Ethics_ is a
collection of separate discourses worked up into a tolerably systematic
treatise; and the interesting point is that these discourses correspond
to separate titles in the list of Diogenes Laertius ([Greek: peri kalou,
peri dikaion, peri philias, peri haedonaes, and peri haedonon]). The
same list also refers to tentative notes ([Greek: upomnaemata
epicheiraematika]), and the commentators speak of ethical notes ([Greek:
aethika upomnaemata]). Indeed, they sometimes divide Aristotle's works
into notes ([Greek: upomnaematika]) and compilations ([Greek:
syntagmatika]). How can it be doubted that in the gradual composition of
his works Aristotle began with notes ([Greek: upomnaematika]) and
discourses ([Greek: logoi]), and proceeded to treatises ([Greek:
pragmateiai])? He would even be drawn into this process by his writing
materials, which were papyrus rolls of some magnitude; he would tend to
write discourses on separate rolls, and then fasten them together in a
bundle into a treatise.

If then Aristotle was for some thirty-five years gradually and
simultaneously composing manuscript discourses into treatises and
treatises into a system, he was pursuing a process which solves
beforehand the very difficulties which have since been found in his
writings. He could very easily write in different styles at different
times, now avoiding hiatus and now not, sometimes writing diffusely and
sometimes briefly, partly polishing and partly leaving in the rough,
according to the subject, his own state of health or humour, his age,
and the degree to which he had developed a given topic; and all this
even in the same manuscript as well as in different manuscripts, so that
a difference of style between different parts of a work or between
different works, explicable by one being earlier than another, does not
prove either to be not genuine. As he might write, so might he think
differently in his long career. To put one extreme case, about the soul
he could think at first in the _Eudemus_ like Plato that it is
imprisoned in the body, and long afterwards in the _De Anima_ like
himself that it is the immateriate essence of the material bodily
organism. Again, he might be inconsistent; now, for example, calling a
universal a substance in deference to Plato, and now denying that a
universal can be a substance in consequence of his own doctrine that
every substance is an individual; and so as to contradict himself in the
same treatise, though not in the same breath or at the same moment of
thinking. Again, in developing his discourses into larger treatises he
might fall into dislocations; although it must be remembered that these
are often inventions of critics who do not understand the argument, as
when they make out that the treatment of reciprocal justice in the
_Ethics_ (v. 5-6) needs rearrangement through their not noticing that,
according to Aristotle, reciprocal justice, being the fairness of a
commercial bargain, is not part of absolute or political justice, but is
part of analogical or economical justice. Or he might make repetitions,
as in the same book, where he twice applies the principle, that so far
as the agent does the patient suffers, first to the corrective justice
of the law court (_Eth_. v. 4) in order to prove that in a wrong the
injurer gains as much as the injured loses, and immediately afterwards
to the reciprocal justice of commerce (_ib_. 5) in order to prove that
in a bargain a house must be exchanged for as many shoes as equal it in
value. Or he might himself, without double versions, repeat the same
argument with a different shade of meaning; as when in the _Nic. Ethics_
(vii. 4) he first argues that incontinence about such natural pleasures
as that of gain is only modified incontinence, a sign (as _causa
cognoscendi_) of which is that it is not so bad as incontinence about
carnal pleasures, and then argues that, because (as _causa essendi_) it
is only modified incontinence, therefore it is not so bad. Or he might
return again and again to the same point with a difference: there is a
good instance in his conclusion that the speculative life is the highest
happiness; which he first infers because it is the life of man's highest
and divine faculty, intelligence (1176 b-1178 a 8), then after an
interval infers a second time because our speculative life is an
imitation of that of God (1178 b 7-32), and finally after another
interval infers a third time, because it will make man most dear to God
(1179 a 22-32). Or, extending himself as it were still more, he might
write two drafts, or double versions of his own, on the same subject;
_e.g. Physics_, vii. and _De Anima_, ii. Or he might, going still
further, in his long literary career write two or more treatises on the
same subject, different and even more or less inconsistent with each
other, as we shall find in the sequel. Finally, having a great number of
discourses and treatises, containing all those small blemishes, around
him in his library, and determined to collect, consolidate and connect
them into a philosophical system, he would naturally be often taking
them down from their places to consult and compare one with another, and
as naturally enter in them references one to the other, and
cross-references between one another. Thus he would enter in the
_Metaphysics_ a reference to the _Physics_, and in the _Physics_ a
reference to the _Metaphysics_, precisely because both were manuscripts
in his library. For the same purpose of connexion he would be tempted to
add a preface to a book like the _Meteorologica_. In order to refer back
to the _Physics_, the _De Coelo_, and the _De Generatione_, this work
begins by stating that the first causes of all nature and all natural
motion, the stars ordered according to celestial motion and the bodily
elements with their transmutations, and generation and corruption have
all been discussed; and by adding that there remains to complete this
investigation, what previous investigators called meteorology. To
suppose this preface, presupposing many sciences, to have been written
in 356, when the _Meteorologica_ had been already commenced, would be
absurd; but equally absurd would it be to reject that date on account of
the preface, which even a modern author often writes long after his
book. Nor is it at all absurd to suppose that, long after he began the
_Meteorologica_, Aristotle himself added the preface in the process of
gathering his general treatises on natural science into a system. So he
might afterwards add the preface to the _De Interpretatione_, in order
to connect it with the _De Anima_, though written afterwards, in order
to connect his treatises on mind and on its expression. So also he might
add the appendix to the _Sophistical Elenchi_, long after he had written
that book, and perhaps, to judge from its being a general claim to have
discovered the syllogism, when the founder of logic had more or less
realized that he had written a number of connected treatises on
reasoning.

_The Question of Publication._--There is still another point which would
facilitate Aristotle's gradual composition of discourses into treatises
and treatises into a system; there was no occasion for him to publish
his manuscripts beyond his school. Printing has accustomed us to
publication, and misled us into applying to ancient times the modern
method of bringing out one book after another at definite dates by the
same author. But Greek authors contemplated works rather than books.
Some of the greatest authors were not even writers: Homer, Aesop,
Thales, Socrates. Some who were writers were driven to publish by the
occasion; and after the orders of government, which were occasionally
published to be obeyed, occasional poems, such as the poems of Solon,
the odes of Pindar and the plays of the dramatists, which all had a
political significance, were probably the first writings to be published
or, rather, recited and acted, from written copies. With them came
philosophical poems, such as those of Xenophanes and Empedocles; the
epical history of Herodotus; the dramatic philosophy of Plato. On a
larger scale speeches written by orators to be delivered by litigants
were published and encouraged publication; and, as the Attic orators
were his contemporaries, publication had become pretty common in the
time of Aristotle, who speaks of many bundles ([Greek: desmas]) of
judicial speeches by Isocrates being hawked about by the booksellers
(_Fragm_. 140).

No doubt then Aristotle's library contained published copies of the
works of other authors, as well as the autographs of his own. It does
not follow that his own works went beyond his library and his school.
Publication to the world is designed for readers, who at all times have
demanded popular literature rather than serious philosophy such as that
of Aristotle. Accordingly it becomes a difficult question, how far
Aristotle's works were published in his lifetime. In answering it we
must be careful to exclude any evidence which refers to Aristotle as a
man, not as a writer, or refers to him as a writer but does not prove
publication while he was alive.

Beginning then with his early writings, which are now lost, the
dialogues _On Poetry_ and the _Eudemus_ were probably the published
discourses to which Aristotle himself refers (_Poetics_, 15; _De Anima_,
i. 4); and the dialogue _Protrepticus_ was known to the Cynic Crates,
pupil of Diogenes and master of Zeno (_Fragm_. 50), but not necessarily
in Aristotle's lifetime, as Crates was still alive in 307. Again,
Aristotle's early rhetorical instructions and perhaps writings, as well
as his opinion that a collection of proverbs is not worth while, must
have been known outside Aristotle's rhetorical school to the orator
Cephisodorus, pupil of Isocrates and master of Demosthenes, for him to
be able to write in his _Replies to Aristotle_ ([Greek: en tais pros
Aristotelaen antigraphais]) an admired defence of Isocrates (Dionys. H.
_De Isoc_. 18). But this early dialectic and rhetoric, being popular,
would tend to be published. History comes nearer to philosophy; and
Aristotle's _Constitutions_ were known to his enemy Timaeus, who
attacked him for disparaging the descent of the Locrians of Italy,
according to Polybius (xii.), who defended Aristotle. But as Timaeus
brought his history down to 264 B.C. (Polyb. i. 5), and therefore might
have got his information after Aristotle's death, we cannot be sure that
any of the _Constitutions_ were published in the author's lifetime. We
are equally at a loss to prove that Aristotle published his philosophy.
He had, like all the great, many enemies, personal and philosophical;
but in his lifetime they attacked the man, not his philosophy. In the
Megarian school, first Eubulides quarrelled with him and calumniated him
(Diog. Laert. ii. 109) in his lifetime; but the attack was on his life,
not on his writings: afterwards Stilpo wrote a dialogue ([Greek:
Aristotelaes]), which may have been a criticism of the Aristotelian
philosophy from the Megarian point of view; but he outlived Aristotle
thirty years. In the absence of any confirmation, "the current
philosophemata" ([Greek: ta egkuklia philosophaemata]), mentioned in the
_De Coela_ (i. 9, 279 a 30), are sometimes supposed to be Aristotle's
published philosophy, to which he is referring his readers. But the
example there given, that the divine is unchangeable, is precisely such
a religious commonplace as might easily be a current philosopheme of
Aristotle's day, not of Aristotle; and this interpretation suits the
parallel passage in the _Nic. Ethics_ (i. 5, 1096 a 3) where opinions
about the happiness of political life are said to have been sufficiently
treated "even in current discussions" ([Greek: kai en tois egkukliois]).

There is therefore no contemporary proof that Aristotle published any
part of his mature philosophical system in his lifetime. It is true that
a book of Andronicus, as reported by Aulus Gellius (xx. 5), contained a
correspondence between Alexander and Aristotle in which the pupil
complained that his master had published his "acroatic discourses"
([Greek: tous akroatikous ton logon]). But ancient letters are
proverbially forgeries, and in the three hundred years which elapsed
between the supposed correspondence and the time of Andronicus there was
plenty of time for the forgery of these letters. But even if the
correspondence is genuine, "acroatic discourses" must be taken to mean
what Alexander would mean by them in the time of Aristotle, and not what
they had come to mean by the time of Andronicus. Alexander meant those
discourses which Aristotle, when he was his tutor, intended for the ears
of himself and his fellow-pupils; such as the early political works on
_Monarchy_ and on _Colonies_, and the early rhetorical works, the
_Theodectea_, the _Collection of Arts_, and possibly the _Rhetoric to
Alexander_, in the preface to which the writer actually says to
Alexander: "You wrote to me that nobody else should receive this book."
These few early works may have been published, and contrary to the
wishes of Alexander, without affecting Aristotle's later system. But
even so, Alexander's complaint would not justify writers three centuries
later in taking Alexander to have referred to mature scientific
writings, which were not addressed, and not much known, to him, the
conqueror of Asia; although by the times of Andronicus and Aulus
Gellius, Aristotle's scientific writings were all called acroatic, or
acroamatic, or sometimes esoteric, in distinction from exoteric--a
distinction altogether unknown to Aristotle, and therefore to Alexander.
In the absence of any contemporary evidence, we cannot believe that
Aristotle in his lifetime published any, much less all, of his
scientific books. The conclusion then is that Aristotle on the one hand
to some extent published his early dialectical and rhetorical writings,
because they were popular, though now they are lost, but on the other
hand did not publish any of the extant historical and philosophical
works which belong to his mature system, because they were best adapted
to his philosophical pupils in the Peripatetic school. The object of the
philosopher was not the applause of the public but the truth of things.
Now this conclusion has an important bearing on the composition of
Aristotle's writings and on the difficulties which have been found in
them. If he had like a modern author brought out each of his extant
philosophical works on a definite day of publication, he would not have
been able to change them without a second edition, which in the case of
serious writings so little in demand would not be worth while. But as he
did not publish them, but kept the unpublished manuscripts together in
his library and used them in his school, he was able to do with them as
he pleased down to the very end of his life, and so gradually to
consolidate his many works into one system.

While Aristotle did not publish his philosophical works to the world, he
freely communicated them to the Peripatetic school. They are not mere
lectures; but he used them for lectures: he allowed his pupils to read
them in his library, and probably to take copies from them. He also used
diagrams, which are sometimes incorporated in his works, but sometimes
are only mentioned, and were no doubt used for purposes of teaching. He
also availed himself of his pupils' co-operation, as we may judge from
his description in the _Ethics_ (x. 7) of the speculative philosopher
who, though he is self-sufficing, is better having co-operators ([Greek:
synergous hexon]). From an early time he had a tendency to address his
writings to his friends. For example, he addressed the _Theodectea_ to
his pupil Theodectes; and even in ancient times a doubt arose whether it
was a work of the master or the pupil. It was certainly by Aristotle,
because it contained the triple grammatical division of words into noun,
verb and conjunction, which the history of grammar recognized as his
discovery. But we may explain the share of Theodectes by supposing that
he had a hand in the work (cf. Dionys. H. _De Comp. Verb._ 2; Quintilian
i. 4. 18). Similarly in astronomy, Aristotle used the assistance of
Eudoxus and Callippus. Indeed, throughout his writings he shows a
constant wish to avail himself of what is true in the opinions of
others, whether they are philosophers, or poets or ordinary people
expressing their thoughts in sayings and proverbs. With one of his
pupils in particular, Theophrastus, who was born about 370 and therefore
was some fifteen years younger than himself, he had a long and intimate
connexion; and the work of the pupil bears so close a resemblance to
that of his master, that, even when he questions Aristotle's opinions
(as he often does), he seems to be writing in an Aristotelian
atmosphere; while he shows the same acuteness in raising difficulties,
and has caught something of the same encyclopaedic genius. Another
pupil, Eudemus of Rhodes, wrote and thought so like his master as to
induce Simplicius to call him the most genuine of Aristotle's companions
([Greek: ho gnaesiotatos ton Aristotelous hetairon]). It is probable
that this extraordinary resemblance is due to the pupils having actually
assisted their master; and this supposition enables us to surmount a
difficulty we feel in reading Aristotle's works. How otherwise, we
wonder, could one man writing alone and with so few predecessors compose
the first systematic treatises on the psychology of the mental powers
and on the logic of reasoning, the first natural history of animals, and
the first civil history of one hundred and fifty-eight constitutions, in
addition to authoritative treatises on metaphysics, biology, ethics,
politics, rhetoric and poetry; in all penetrating to the very essence of
the subject, and, what is most wonderful, describing more facts than any
other man has ever done on so many subjects?

_The Uncompleted Works._--Such then was the method of composition by
which Aristotle began in early manhood to write his philosophical works,
continued them gradually and simultaneously, combined shorter discourses
into longer treatises, compared and connected them, kept them together
in his library without publishing them, communicated them to his school,
used the co-operation of his best pupils, and finally succeeded in
combining many mature writings into one harmonious system. Nevertheless,
being a man, he did not quite succeed. He left some unfinished; such as
the _Categories_, in which the main part on categories is not finished,
while the last part, afterwards called postpredicaments, is probably not
his, the _Politics_ and the _Poetics_. He left others imperfectly
arranged, and some of the most important, the _Metaphysics_, the
_Politics_ and the logical writings. Of the imperfect arrangement of the
_Metaphysics_ we have already spoken; and we shall speak of that of his
logical writings when we come to the order of his whole system. At
present the _Politics_ will supply us with a conspicuous example of the
imperfect arrangement of some, as well as of the gradual composition of
all, of Aristotle's extant writings.

The _Politics_ was begun as early as 357, yet not finished in 322. It
betrays its origin from separate discourses. First comes a general
theory of constitutions, right and wrong (Books [Alpha], [Beta],
[Gamma]); and this part is afterwards referred to as "the first
discourses" ([Greek: hen tois protois logois]). Then follows the
treatment of oligarchy, democracy, commonwealth and tyranny, and of the
various powers of government ([Delta]), and independent investigation of
revolution, and of the means of preserving states ([Epsilon]), and a
further treatment of democracy and oligarchy, and of the different
offices of the state ([Zeta]), and finally a return to the discussion of
the right form of constitution ([Eta], [Theta]). But [Delta] and [Zeta]
are a group interrupted by [Epsilon], and [Eta] and [Theta] are another
group unconnected with the previous group and with [Epsilon], and are
also distinguished in style by avoiding hiatus. Further, the group
([Delta], [Zeta]) and the group ([Eta], [Theta]) are both unfinished.
Finally the group ([Delta], [Zeta]), the book ([Epsilon]) and the group
([Eta], [Theta]) though unconnected with one another, are all connected
though imperfectly with "the first discourses" ([Alpha], [Beta],
[Gamma]). This complicated arrangement may be represented in the
following diagram:--

                 [Alpha], [Beta], [Gamma]
                            |
     +----------------------+----------------------+
     |                      |                      |
  [Delta],              [Epsilon]                [Eta],
   [Zeta]                                       [Theta]

The simplest explanation is that Aristotle began by writing separate
discourses, four at least, on political subjects; that he continued to
write them and perhaps tried to combine them: but that in the end he
failed and left the _Politics_ unfinished and in disorder. But modern
commentators, possessed by the fallacy that Aristotle like a modern
author must from the first have comtemplated a whole treatise in a
regular order for definite publication, lose themselves in vain disputes
as to whether to go by the traditional order of books indicated by their
letters and known to have existed as early as the abstract (given in
Stobaeus, _Ecl._ ii. 7) ascribed to Didymus (1st century A.D.), or to
put the group [Eta], [Theta], as more connected with [Alpha], [Beta],
[Gamma], before the group [Delta], [Zeta], and this group before the
book [Eta]. It is agreed, says Zeller, that the traditional order
contradicts the original plan. But what right have we to say that
Aristotle had an original plan?

The incomplete state in which Aristotle left the _Metaphysics_, the
_Politics_ and his logical works, brings us to the hard question how
much he did, and how much his Peripatetic followers did to his writings
after his death. To answer it we should have to go far beyond Aristotle.
But two corollaries follow from our present investigation of his extant
writings; the first, that it was the long continuance of the Peripatetic
school which gradually caused the publication, and in some cases the
forgery, of the separate writings; and the second, that his Peripatetic
successors arranged and edited some of Aristotle's writings, and
gradually arrived by the time of Andronicus, the eleventh from
Aristotle, at an order of the whole body of writings forming the system.
Now, it is probable that the arrangement of the works which we are
considering was done by the Peripatetic successors of Aristotle. There
is nothing indeed in the _Metaphysics_ to show whether he left it in
isolated treatises or in its present disorder; and nothing in the
_Politics_. On the other hand, in the case of logic, it is certain that
he did not combine his works on the subject into one whole, but that the
Peripatetics afterwards put them together as organic, and made them the
parts of logic as an organon, as they are treated by Andronicus. Perhaps
something similar occurred to the _Metaphysics_, as Alexander imputed
its redaction to Eudemus, and the majority of ancient commentators
attributed its second opening (Book [alpha]) to Pasicles, nephew of
Eudemus. Again, it is not unlikely that the _Politics_ was arranged in
the traditional order of books by Theophrastus, and that this is the
meaning of the curious title occurring in the list of Aristotle's works
as given by Diogenes Laertius, [Greek: politikês akroaseos hos hê
theophrastou a' b' g' d' e' s' z' ê'], which agrees with the _Politics_
in having eight books. Although, however, we may concede that such great
works as the _Metaphysics_, the _Politics_ and the logical writings did
not receive their present form from Aristotle himself, that concession
does not deprive Aristotle of the authorship, but only of the
arrangement of those works. On the contrary, Theophrastus and Eudemus,
his immediate followers, both wrote works presupposing Aristotle's
_Metaphysics_ and his logical works, and Dicaearchus, their
contemporary, used his _Politics_ for his own _Tripoliticus_. It was
Aristotle himself then who wrote these works, whether he arranged them
or not; and if he wrote the incomplete works, then _a fortiori_ he wrote
the completed works except those which are proved spurious, and
practically consummated the Aristotelian system, which, as Leibnitz
said, by its unity of thought and style evinces its own genuineness and
individuality. We must not exaggerate the school and underrate the
individual, especially such an individual. What he mainly wanted was the
time, the leisure and the labour, which we have supposed to have been
given to the gradual composition of the extant Aristotelian writings.
Aristotle, asked where dwell the Muses, answered, "In the souls of those
who love work."

IV. EARLIER AND LATER WRITINGS

Aristotle's quotations of his other books and of historical facts only
inform us at best of the dates of isolated passages, and cannot decide
the dates and sequences of whole philosophical books which occupied him
for many years. Is there then any way of discriminating between early
and late works? There is the evidence of the influences under which the
books were written. This evidence applies to the whole Aristotelian
literature including the fragments. As to the fragments, we are safe in
saying that the early dialogues in the manner of Plato were written
under the influence of Plato, and that the subsequent didactic writings
connected with Alexander were written more under the influence of Philip
and Alexander. Turning to the extant writings, we find that some are
more under the influence of Plato, while others are more original and
Aristotelian. Also some writings are more rudimentary than others on the
same subject; and some have the appearance of being first drafts of
others. By these differences we can do something to distinguish between
earlier and later philosophical works; and also vindicate as genuine
some works, which have been considered spurious because they do not
agree in style or in matter with his most mature philosophy. In
thirty-five years of literary composition, Aristotle had plenty of time
to change, because any man can differ from himself at different times.

On these principles, we regard as early genuine philosophical works of
Aristotle, (1) the _Categories_, (2) the _De Interpretatione_;(3) the
_Eudemian Ethics_ and _Magna Moralia_; (4) the _Rhetoric to Alexander_.

1. The Categories ([Greek: kataegoriai]).--This short discourse turns on
Aristotle's fundamental doctrine of individual substances, without which
there is nothing. He arrives at it from a classification of categories,
by which he here means "things stated in no combination" ([Greek: ta
kata maedemian symplokaen legomena]) or what we should call "names,"
capable of becoming predicates ([Greek: kataegoroumena, kataegoriai]).
"Every name," says he (chap. 4), "signifies either substance or
something quantitative, or qualitative, or relative, or somewhere, or
sometimes, or that it is in a position, or in a condition, or active or
passive." He immediately adds that, by the combination of these names
with one another, affirmation or negation arises. The categories then
are names signifying things capable of becoming predicates in a
proposition. Next he proceeds to substances ([Greek: ousiai]), which he
divides into primary ([Greek: protai]) and secondary ([Greek:
deuterai]). "Substance", says he (chap. 5), "which is properly,
primarily and especially so called, is that which is neither a predicate
of a subject nor inherent in a subject; for example, a particular man,
or a particular horse. Secondary substances so called are the species in
which are the primarily called substances, and the genera of these
species: for example, a particular man is in a species, man, the genus
of which is animal: these then are called secondary substances, man and
animal." Having made these subdivisions of substance, he thereupon
reduces secondary substances and all the rest of the categories to
belongings of individual or primary substances. "All other things", says
he, "are either predicates of primary substances as subjects" ([Greek:
kath' hypokeimenon ton proton ousion]) "or inherent in them as subjects"
([Greek: en hypokeimenais autais]). He explains that species and genus
are predicates of, and that other categories (e.g. the quality of
colour) are inherent in, some individual substance such as a particular
man. Then follows his conclusion: "without primary substances it is
impossible for anything to be" ([Greek: mae ouson oun ton proton ousion
adunaton ton hallon ti einai]. _Cat._ 5, 2 b 5-6).

Things are individual substances, without which there is nothing--this
is the fundamental point of Aristotelianism, as against Platonism, of
which the fundamental point is that things are universal forms without
which there becomes nothing. The world, according to Aristotle, consists
of substances, each of which is a separate individual, this man, this
horse, this animal, this plant, this earth, this water, this air, this
fire; in the heavens that moon, that sun, those stars; above all, God.
On the other hand, a universal species or genus of substances is a
predicate which, as well as everything else in all the other categories,
always belongs to some individual substance or other as subject, and has
no separate being. In full, then, a substance is a separate individual,
having universals, and things in all other categories, inseparably
belonging to it. The individual substance Socrates, for example, is a
man and an animal ([Greek: ousia]), tall, ([Greek: poson]), white
([Greek: poion]), a husband ([Greek: pros ti]), in the market ([Greek:
pou]), yesterday ([Greek: pote]), sitting ([Greek: keisthai]), armed
([Greek: hechein]), talking ([Greek: poiein]), listening ([Greek:
paschein]). Aristotelianism is this philosophy of substantial things.

  The doctrine that all things are substances which are separate
  individuals, stated in the _Categories_, is expanded in the
  _Metaphysics_. Both works arrive at it from the classification of
  categories, which is the same in both; except that in the former the
  categories are treated rather as a logical classification of names
  signifying things, in the latter rather as a metaphysical
  classification of things. In neither, however, are they a grammatical
  classification of words by their structure; and in neither are they a
  psychological classification of notions or general conceptions
  ([Greek: noaemata]), such as they afterwards became in Kant's
  _Critique_ and the post-Kantian idealism. Moreover, even in the
  _Categories_ as names signifying distinct things they imply distinct
  things; and hence the _Categories_, as well as the _Metaphysics_,
  draws the metaphysical conclusion that individual substances are the
  things without which there is nothing else, and thereby lays the
  positive foundation of the philosophy running through all the extant
  Aristotelian writings.

  Again, according to both works, an individual substance is a subject,
  a universal its predicate; and they have in common the Aristotelian
  metaphysics, which differs greatly from the modern logic of subject
  and predicate. Subject ([Greek: upokeimenon]) originally meant a real
  thing which is the basis of something, and was used by Aristotle both
  for a thing to which something belongs and for a name of which another
  is asserted: accordingly "predicate" ([Greek: kataegoroymenon]) came
  with him to mean something really belonging ([Greek: uparchon]) to a
  substance as real subject, as well as a name capable of being asserted
  of a name as a nominal subject. In other words, to him subject meant
  real as well as nominal subject, and predicate meant real as well as
  nominal predicate; whereas modern logic has gradually reduced both to
  the nominal terms of a proposition. Accordingly, when he said that a
  substance is a subject, he meant a real subject; and when he said that
  a universal species or genus is a predicate, he meant that it is a
  real predicate belonging to a real subject, which is always some
  individual substance of the kind. It follows that Aristotelianism in
  the _Categories_ and in the _Metaphysics_ is a realism both of
  individuals and of universals; of individual substances as real
  subjects, and of universals as real predicates.

  Lastly, the two works agree in reducing the _Categories_ to substance
  and its belongings ([Greek: uparchonta]). According to both, it is
  always some substance, such as Socrates, which is quantitative,
  qualitative, relative, somewhere, some time, placed, conditioned,
  active, passive; so that all things in all other categories are
  attributes which are belongings of substances. There are therefore two
  kinds of belongings, universals and attributes; and in both cases
  belonging in the sense of having no being but the being of the
  substance.

  In brief then the common ground of the _Categories_ and the
  _Metaphysics_ is the fundamental position that all things are
  substances having belonging to them universals and attributes, which
  have no separate being as Plato falsely supposed.

  This essential agreement suffices to show that the _Categories_ and
  the _Metaphysics_ are the result of one mind. Nevertheless, there is a
  deep difference between them in detail, which may be expressed by
  saying that the _Categories_ is nearer to Platonism. We have seen how
  anxious Aristotle was to be considered one of the Platonists, how
  reluctant he was to depart from Plato's hypothesis of forms, and how,
  in denying the separability, he retained the Platonic belief in the
  reality and even in the unity of the universal. We have now to see
  that, in writing the _Categories_, on the one hand he carried his
  differences from his master further than he had done in his early
  criticisms by insisting that individual substances are not only real,
  but are the very things which sustain the universal; but on the other
  hand, he clung to further relics of the Platonic theory, and it is
  those which differentiate the _Categories_ and the _Metaphysics_.

  In the first place, in the _Categories_ the belonging of things in
  other categories to individual substances in the first category is not
  so well developed. A distinction (chap. 2) is drawn between things
  which are predicates of a subject ([Greek: kath upokeimenon]) and
  things which inhere in a subject ([Greek: en ipokeimeno]); and, while
  universals are called predicates of a subject, things in a subordinate
  category, i.e. attributes such as colour ([Greek: chroma]) in the
  qualitative, are said to inhere in a subject. It is true that the work
  gives only a negative definition of the inherent, namely, that it does
  not inhere as a part and cannot exist apart from that in which it
  inheres (1 a 24-25), and it admits that what is inherent may sometimes
  also be a predicate (chap. 5, 2 a 27-34). The commentators explain
  this to mean that an attribute as individual is inherent, as universal
  is a predicate. But even so the _Categories_ concludes that everything
  is either a predicate of, or inherent in, a substance; and the view
  that this colour belongs to this substance only in the sense of being
  in it, not of it, leaves the impression that, like a Platonic form, it
  is an entity rather in than of an individual substance, though even in
  the _Categories_ Aristotle is careful to deny its separability. The
  hypothesis of inherence gives an inadequate account of the dependence
  of an attribute on a substance, and is a kind of half-way house
  between separation and predication.

  On the other hand, in the _Metaphysics_, the distinction between
  inherence and predication disappears; and what is more, the relation
  of an attribute to a substance is regarded as so close that an
  attribute is merely the substance modified. "The thing itself and the
  thing affected," says Aristotle, "are in a way the same; e.g. Socrates
  and Socrates musical" (_Met._ [Delta] 29, 1024 b 30-31). Consequently,
  all attributes, as well as universals, belong as predicates of
  individual substances as subjects, according to the _Metaphysics_, and
  also according to the most authoritative works of Aristotle, such as
  the _Posterior Analytics_, where (cf. i. 4, 22) an attribute ([Greek:
  symbebaekos]) is said to be only by being the substance possessing it,
  and any separation of an attribute from a substance is held to be
  entirely a work of human abstraction ([Greek: aphairesis]). At this
  point, Plato and Aristotle have become very far apart: to the master
  beauty appears to be an independent thing, and really separate, to the
  pupil at his best only something beautiful, an attribute which is only
  mentally separable from an individual substance. The first difference
  then between the _Categories_ and the _Metaphysics_ is in the nature
  of an attribute; and the theory of inherence in the _Categories_ is
  nearer to Plato and more rudimentary than the theory of predication in
  the _Metaphysics_. The second difference is still nearer to Plato and
  more rudimentary, and is in the nature of substance. For though both
  works rest on the reality of individual substances, the _Categories_
  (chap. 5) admits that universal species and genera can be called
  substances, whereas the _Metaphysics_ ([Zeta] 13) denies that a
  universal can be a substance at all.

  It is evident that in the category of substance, as Aristotle
  perceived, substance is predicate of substance, e.g. Socrates ([Greek:
  ousia]) is a man ([Greek: ousia]), and an animal ([Greek: ousia]). The
  question then arises, what sort of substance can be predicate; and in
  the _Categories_ Aristotle gave an answer, which would have been
  impossible, if he had not, under Plato's influence, accepted both the
  unity and the substantiality of the universal. What he said in
  consequence was that the substance in the predicate is not an
  individual substance, e.g. this man or this animal, because such a
  primary substance is not a predicate; but that the species man or the
  genus animal is the substance which is the predicate of Socrates the
  subject (_Cat._ 5, 3 a 36 seq.). Finding then that substances are real
  predicates, and supposing that in that case they must be species or
  genera, he could not avoid the conclusion that some substances are
  species or genera, which were therefore called by him "secondary
  substances," and by his Latin followers _substantiae universales_. It
  is true that this conclusion gave him some misgivings, because he
  recognized that it is a characteristic of a substance to signify an
  individual ([Greek: tose ti]), which a species or a genus does not
  signify (_ib._ 5, 3 b 10-21). Nevertheless, in the _Categories_, he
  did not venture to deny that in the category of substance a universal
  species (e.g. man), or genus (e.g. animal), is itself a substance. On
  the other hand, in the _Metaphysics_ ([Zeta] 13), he distinctly denies
  that any universal can be a substance, on the ground that a substance
  is a subject, whereas a universal is a predicate and a belonging of a
  subject, from which it follows as he says that no universal is a
  substance, and no substance universal. Here again the _Categories_
  forms a kind of transition from Platonism to the _Metaphysics_ which
  is the reverse: to call universals "secondary substances" is half way
  between Plato's calling them the only substances and Aristotle's
  denial in the _Metaphysics_ that they are substances at all.

  What conclusion are we to draw from these differences between the
  _Categories_ and the _Metaphysics_? The only logical conclusion is
  that the _Categories_, being nearer to Plato on the nature of
  attributes, and still nearer on the relation of universals to
  substances, is earlier than the _Metaphysics_. There are difficulties
  no doubt in drawing this conclusion; because the _Metaphysics_, though
  it denies that universals can be substances, and does not allow
  species and genera to be called "secondary substances," nevertheless
  falls itself into calling a universal essence ([Greek: to ti aen
  einai]) a substance---and that too in the very book where it is proved
  that no universal can be a substance. But this lapse only shows how
  powerful a dominion Plato exercised over Aristotle's soul to the last;
  for it arises out of the pupil still accepting from his master the
  unity of the universal though now applying it, not to classes, but to
  essences. The argument about essences in the _Metaphysics_ is as
  follows:--Since a separate individual, e.g. Socrates, is a substance,
  and he is essentially a rational animal, then his essence, being what
  he is, is a substance; for we cannot affirm that Socrates is a
  substance and then deny that this rational animal is a substance
  (_Met._ [Zeta] 3). Now, according to the unity of a universal asserted
  by Plato and accepted by Aristotle, the universal essence of species,
  being one and the same for all individuals of the kind, is the same as
  the essence of each individual: e.g. the rational animal in the human
  species and in Socrates is one and the same; "for the essence is
  indivisible" ([Greek: atomon gar to eisos], _Met._ [Zeta] 8, 1034 a
  8). It follows that we must call this selfsame essence, at once
  individual and universal, substance--a conclusion, however, which
  Aristotle never drew in so many words, though he continued always to
  call essence substance, and definition a knowledge of substance.

  There is therefore a history of Aristotle's metaphysical views,
  corresponding to his gradual method of composition. It is as
  follows:--

  (1) Negative rejection of Plato's hypothesis of forms and formal
  numbers, and reduction of forms to the common in the early dialogue
  [Greek: peri philosophias] and in the early work [Greek: peri iseon].

  (2) Positive assertion of the doctrine that things are individual
  substances in the _Categories_, but with the admission that attributes
  sometimes inhere in substance without being predicates of it, and that
  universal species and genera are "secondary substances."

  (3) Expansion of the doctrine that things are individual substances in
  the _Metaphysics_, coupled with the reduction of all attributes to
  predicates, and the direct denial of universal substances; but
  nevertheless calling the universal essence of a species of substances
  substance, because the individual essence of an individual substance
  really is that substance, and the universal essence of the whole
  species is supposed to be indivisible and therefore identical with the
  individual essence of any individual of the species.

2. The _De Interpretatione._--Another example of Aristotle's gradual
desertion of Plato is exhibited by the _De Interpretatione_ as compared
with the _Prior Analytics_, and it shows another gradual history in
Aristotle's philosophy, namely, the development of subject, predicate
and copula, in his logic.

The short discourse on the expression of thought by language ([Greek:
peri Ermaeneias], _De Interpretatione_) is based on the Platonic
division of the sentence ([Greek: logos]) into noun and verb ([Greek:
onoma] and [Greek: rema].) Its point is to separate the enunciative
sentence, or that in which there is truth or falsity, from other
sentences; and then, dismissing the rest to rhetoric or poetry (where we
should say grammar), to discuss the enunciative sentence ([Greek:
apophantikos logos]), or enunciation ([apophansís]), or what we should
call the proposition (_De Int._ chap. 4). Here Aristotle, starting from
the previous grammar of sentences in general, proceeded, for the first
time in philosophical literature, to disengage the logic of the
proposition, or that sentence which can alone be true or false, whereby
it alone enters into reasoning. But in spite of this great logical
achievement, he continued throughout the discourse to accept Plato's
grammatical analysis of all sentences into noun and verb, which indeed
applies to the proposition as a sentence but does not give its
particular elements. The first part of the work confines itself strictly
to noun and verb, or the form of proposition called _secundi
adjacentis_. Afterwards (chap. 10) proceeding to the opposition of
propositions, he adds the form called _tertii adjacentis_, in a passage
which is the first appearance, or rather adumbration, of the verb of
being as a copula. In the form _secundi adjacentis_ we only get
oppositions, such as the following:--

  man is--man is not
  not-man is--not-man is not

In the form _tertii adjacentis_ the oppositions, becoming more complex,
are doubled, as follows:--

  man is just--man is not just
  man is non-just--man is not non-just
  not-man is just--not-man is not just
  not-man is non-just--not-man is not non-just.

The words introducing this form ([Greek: dtan de to esti triton
proskategoretai], chap. 10, 19 b 19), which are the origin of the phrase
_tertii adjacentis_, disengage the verb of being ([Greek: esti])
partially but not entirely, because they still treat it as an extra part
of the predicate, and not as a distinct copula. Nor does the work get
further than the analysis of some propositions into noun and verb with
"is" added to the predicated verb; an analysis, however, which was a
great logical discovery and led Aristotle further to the remark that
"is" does not mean "exists"; e.g. "Homer is a poet" does not mean "Homer
exists" (_De Int._ chap. 11).

How then did Aristotle get further in the logical analysis of the
proposition? Not in the _De Interpretatione_, but in the _Prior
Analytics_. The first adumbration was forced upon him in the former work
by his theory of opposition; the complete appearance in the latter work
by his theory of syllogism. In analysing the syllogism, he first says
that a premiss is an affirmative or negative sentence, and then that a
term is that into which a premiss is dissolved, i.e. predicate and
subject, combined or divided by being and not being (_Pr. An._ i. 1).
Here, for the first time in logical literature, subject and predicate
suddenly appear as terms, or extremes, with the verb of being ([Greek:
to einai]) or not being ([Greek: to me einai]) completely disengaged
from both, but connecting them as a copula. Why here? Because the
crossing of terms in a syllogism requires it. In the syllogism "Every
man is mortal and Socrates is a man," if in the minor premiss the copula
"is" were not disengaged from the predicate "man," there would not be
one middle term "man" in the two premisses. It is not necessary in every
proposition, but it is necessary in the arrangement of a syllogism, to
extricate the terms of its propositions from the copula; e.g.
mortal--man--Socrates.

This important difference between the _De Interpretatione_ and the
_Prior Analytics_ can only be explained by supposing that the former is
the earlier treatise. It is nearer to Plato's analysis of the sentence,
and no logician would have gone back to it, after the Prior Analytics.
It is not spurious, as some have supposed, nor later than the _De
Anima_, as Zeller thought, but Aristotle in an earlier frame of mind.

Moreover we can make a history of Aristotle's thought and gradual
composition thus:

(1) Earlier acceptance in the _De Interpretatione_ of Plato's
grammatical analysis of the sentence into noun and verb (_secundi
adjacentis_) but gradually disengaging the proposition, and afterwards
introducing the verb of being as a third thing added (_tertium
adjacens_) to the predicated verb, for the purpose of opposition.

(2) Later logical analysis in the _Prior Analytics_ of the proposition
as premiss into subject, predicate and copula, for the purpose of
syllogism; but without insisting that the original form is illogical.

3. The _Eudemian Ethics_ and _Magna Moralia_ in relation to the
_Nicomachean Ethics._--Under the name of Aristotle, three treatises on
the good of man have come down to us, [Greek: Ethika Nikomacheia]
([Greek: pros Nikomachon], Porphyry), [Greek: Ethika Eudemia] ([Greek:
pros Eudemon], Porphyry), and [Greek: Ethika Megala]; so like one
another that there seems no tenable hypothesis except that they are the
manuscript writings of one man. Nevertheless, the most usual hypothesis
is that, while the _Nicomachean Ethics_ (E.N.) was written by Aristotle
to Nicomachus, the _Eudemian_ (E.E.) was written, not to, but by,
Eudemus, and the _Magna Moralia_ (M.M.) was written by some early
disciple before the introduction of Stoic and Academic elements into the
Peripatetic school. The question is further complicated by the fact that
three Nicomachean books (E.N. v.-vii.) and three Eudemian (E.E.
[Delta]-[Zeta]) are common to the two treatises, and by the consequent
question whether, on the hypothesis of different authorship, the common
books, as we may style them, were written for the _Nicomachean_ by
Aristotle, or for the _Eudemian Ethics_ by Eudemus, or some by one and
some by the other author. Against the "Chorizontes," who have advanced
various hypotheses on all these points without convincing one another,
it may be objected that they have not considered Aristotle's method of
gradual and simultaneous composition of manuscripts within the
Peripatetic school. We have to remember the traces of his separate
discourses, and his own double versions; and that, as in ancient times
Simplicius, who had two versions of the _Physics_, Book vii., suggested
that both were early versions of Book viii. on the same subject, so in
modern times Torstrik, having discovered that there were two versions of
the _De Anima_, Book ii., suggested that both were by Aristotle. Above
all, we must consider our present point that Platonic influence is a
sign of earliness in an Aristotelian work; and generally, the same man
may both think and write differently at different times, especially if,
like Aristotle, he has been a prolific author.

These considerations make it probable that the author of all three
treatises was Aristotle himself; while the analysis of the treatises
favours the hypothesis that he wrote the _Eudemian Ethics_ and the
_Magna Moralia_ more or less together as the rudimentary first drafts of
the mature _Nicomachean Ethics_.

As the Platonic philosophy was primarily moral, and its metaphysics a
theory of the moral order of the universe, Aristotle from the first must
have mastered the Platonic ethics. At first he adopted the somewhat
ascetic views of his master about soul and body, and about goods of body
and estate; but before Plato's death he had rejected the hypothesis of
forms, formal numbers and the form of the good identified with the one,
by which Plato tried to explain moral phenomena; while his studies and
teaching on rhetoric and poetry soon began to make him take a more
tolerant view than Plato did of men's passions. Throughout his whole
subsequent life, however, he retained the fundamental doctrine, which he
had learnt from Plato, and Plato from Socrates, that virtue is essential
to happiness. Twice over this tenet, which makes Socrates, Plato and
Aristotle one ethical school, inspired Aristotle to attempt poetry:
first, in the Elegy to Eudemus of Cyprus, in which, referring to either
Socrates or Plato, he praises the man who first showed clearly that a
good and happy man are the same (_Fragm._ 673); and secondly, in the
Hymn in memory of Hermias, beginning "Virtue, difficult to the human
race, noblest pursuit in life" (_ib._ 675). Moreover, the successors of
Plato in the Academy, Speusippus and Xenocrates, showed the same belief
in the essentiality of virtue. The question which divided them was what
the good is. Speusippus took the ascetic view that the good is a perfect
condition of neutrality between two contrary evils, pain and pleasure.
Xenocrates took the tolerant view that it is the possession of
appropriate virtue and noble actions, requiring as conditions bodily
and external goods. Aristotle was opposed to Speusippus, and nearly
agreed with Xenocrates. According to him, the good is activity of soul
in accordance with virtue in a mature life, requiring as conditions
bodily and external goods of fortune; and virtue is a mean state of the
passions. It is probable that when, after Plato's death and the
accession of Speusippus in 347, Aristotle with Xenocrates left Athens to
visit his former pupil Hermias, the three discussed this moderate system
of Ethics in which the two philosophers nearly agreed. At any rate, it
was adopted in each of the three moral treatises which pass under the
name of Aristotle.

  The three treatises are in very close agreement throughout, and in the
  following details. The good of Ethics is human good; and human good is
  happiness, not the universal good or form of the good to which Plato
  subordinated human happiness. Happiness is activity of soul according
  to virtue in a mature life: it requires other goods only as
  conditions. The soul is partly irrational, partly rational; and
  therefore there are two kinds of virtue. Moral virtue, which is that
  of the irrational desires so far as they are obedient to reason, is a
  purposive habit in the mean. The motive of the moral virtues is the
  honourable ([Greek: to kalon], _honestum_). As the rational is either
  deliberative or scientific, either practical or speculative intellect,
  there are two virtues of the intellect--prudence of the deliberative
  or practical, and wisdom of the scientific or speculative, intellect.
  The right reason by which moral virtue is determined is prudence,
  which is determined in its turn by wisdom. Pleasure is a psychical
  state, and is not a generation in the body supplying a defect and
  establishing a natural condition, but an activity of a natural
  condition of the soul. It should be specially noted that this doctrine
  like the rest is common to the three treatises: in Book vii. of the
  _Nicomachean_, which is [Zeta] of the _Eudemian_, pleasure is defined
  as [Greek: energeia taes kata thusin exeos anempodistos] (chap. 12,
  1153 a 14-15); and in the _Magna Moralia_ as [Greek: hae kinaesis
  autou kai hae energeia] (ii. 7, 1204 b 28; cf. 1205 b 20-28). It is
  plain from the context that in the former definition "the natural
  condition" ([Greek: hae kata thusin exis]) refers to the soul which,
  while the body is regenerated, remains unimpaired (cf. 1152 b 35 seq.,
  1154 b 15 seq.); and in the latter definition the thing ([Greek:
  autou]), whose "motion, that is activity" is spoken of, is the part of
  the soul with which we feel pleased.

  Down then to their common definition of pleasure as activity the three
  treatises present a harmonious system of morals, consistently with one
  another, and with the general philosophy of Aristotle. In particular,
  the theory that pleasure is activity ([Greek: energeia]) is the theory
  of two of his most authoritative works. In the _De Anima_ (iii. 7, 431
  a 10-12), being pleased and pained are defined by him as acting
  [Greek: to] ([Greek: energein]) by a sensitive mean in relation to
  good or evil as such. In the _Metaphysics_ ([lambda] 7, 1072 b 16), in
  discussing the occupation of God, he says "his pleasure is activity,"
  or "his activity is pleasure," according to a difference of readings
  which makes no difference to the identification of pleasure and
  activity ([Greek: energeia]). As then we find this identification of
  pleasure with activity in the _Metaphysics_ and in the _De Anima_, as
  well as in the _Nicomachean Ethics_, the _Eudemian Ethics_ and the
  _Magna Moralia_, the only logical conclusion, from which there is no
  escape, is that, so far as the treatment of pleasure goes, any
  Aristotelian treatise which defines it as activity is genuine. There
  is no reason for doubting that the _Nicomachean Ethics_ to the end of
  Book vii., the _Eudemian Ethics_ to the end of Book [Zeta], and the
  _Magna Moralia_ as far as Book ii. chap. 7, were all three written by
  Aristotle.

  Why then doubt at all? It is because the _Nicomachean Ethics_ contains
  a second discourse on pleasure (x. 1-5), in which the author, while
  agreeing with the previous treatment of the subject that pleasure is
  not a bodily generation, even when accompanied by it, but something
  psychical, nevertheless defines it (x. 4, 1174 b 31-33) not as an
  activity, but as a supervening end ([Greek: epigignomenon ti telos])
  perfecting an activity ([Greek: teleioi taen energeian]). He allows
  indeed that activity and pleasure are very closely related; that a
  pleasure of sense or thought perfects an act of sensation or of
  thinking, depends on it, and is so inseparably conjoined with it as to
  raise a doubt whether pleasure is end of life or life end of pleasure,
  and even whether the activity is the same as the pleasure. But he
  disposes of this doubt in a very emphatic and significant manner.
  "Pleasure," says he, "does not seem to be thinking or perceiving; for
  it is absurd: but on account of not being separated from them, it
  appears to some persons to be the same." Now it is not likely that
  Aristotle either, after having so often identified pleasure with
  activity, would say that the identification is absurd though it
  appears true to some persons, of whom he would in that case be one,
  or, having once disengaged the pleasure of perceiving and thinking
  from the acts of perceiving and thinking, would go backwards and
  confuse them. It is more likely that Aristotle identified pleasure
  with activity in the _De Anima_, the _Metaphysics_ and the three moral
  treatises, as we have seen; but that afterwards some subsequent
  Peripatetic, considering that the pleasure of perceiving or thinking
  is not the same as perceiving or thinking, declared the previous
  identification of pleasure with activity absurd. At any rate, if we
  are to choose, it is the identification that is Aristotle's, and the
  distinction not Aristotle's. Moreover, the distinction between
  activity and pleasure in the tenth book is really fatal to the
  consistency of the whole _Nicomachean Ethics_, which started in the
  first book with the identification of happiness and virtuous activity.
  For if the pleasure of virtuous activity is a supervening end beyond
  the activity, it becomes a supervening end beyond the happiness of
  virtuous activity, which thus ceases to be the final end.
  Nevertheless, the distinction between activity and pleasure is true.
  Some unknown Peripatetic detected a flaw in the _Nicomachean Ethics_
  when he said that pleasure is a supervening end beyond activity, and,
  if he had gone on to add that happiness is also a supervening end
  beyond the virtuous activities which are necessary to produce it, he
  would have destroyed the foundation of his own founder's Ethics.

  It is further remarkable that the _Nicomachean Ethics_ proceeds to a
  different conclusion. After the intrusion of this second discourse on
  pleasure, it goes on (E.N. x. 6-fin.) to the famous theory that the
  highest happiness is the speculative life of intellect or wisdom as
  divine, but that happiness as human also includes the practical life
  of combining prudence and moral virtue; and that, while both lives
  need external goods as necessaries, the practical life also requires
  them as instruments of moral action. The treatise concludes with the
  means of making men virtuous; contending that virtue requires
  habituation, habituation law, law legislative art, and legislative art
  politics: Ethics thus passes into Politics. The _Eudemian Ethics_
  proceeds to its conclusion (E.E. [Eta] 13-15) differently, with the
  consideration of (1) good fortune ([Greek: eutuchia]), and (2)
  gentlemanliness ([Greek: kalokagathia]). Good fortune it divides into
  two kinds, both irrational; one divine, according to impulse, and more
  continuous; the other contrary to impulse and not continuous.
  Gentlemanliness it regards as perfect virtue, containing all
  particular virtues, and all goods for the sake of the honourable.
  Finally, it concludes with the limit ([Greek: horos]) of goods. First
  it finds the limit of goods of fortune in that desire and possession
  of them which will conduce to the contemplation of God, whereas that
  which prevents the service and contemplation of God is bad. Then it
  adds that the best limit of the soul is as little as possible to
  perceive the other part of the soul (i.e. desire). Finally, the
  treatise concludes with saying that the limit of gentlemanliness has
  thus been stated, meaning that its limit is the service and
  contemplation of God and the control of desire by reason. The _Magna
  Moralia_ (M.M. ii. 8-10) on these points is unlike the _Nicomachean_,
  and like the _Eudemian Ethics_ in discussing good fortune and
  gentlemanliness, but it discusses them in a more worldly way. On good
  fortune (ii. 8), after recognizing the necessity of external goods to
  happiness, it denies that fortune is due to divine grace, and simply
  defines it as irrational nature ([Greek: alogos thusis]).
  Gentlemanliness (ii. 9) it regards as perfect virtue, and defines the
  gentleman as the man to whom really good things are good and really
  honourable things honourable. It then adds (ii. 10) that acting
  according to right reason is when the irrational part of the soul does
  not hinder the rational part of intellect from doing its work.
  Thereupon it proceeds to a discourse on friendship, which in the
  _Nicomachean_ and _Eudemian Ethics_ is discussed in an earlier
  position, but breaks off unfinished.

  On the whole, the three moral treatises proceed on very similar lines
  down to the common identification of pleasure with activity, and then
  diverge. From this point the _Eudemian Ethics_ and the _Magna Moralia_
  become more like one another than like the _Nicomachean Ethics_. They
  also become less like one another than before: for the treatment of
  good fortune, gentlemanliness, and their limit is more theological in
  the _Eudemian Ethics_ than in the _Magna Moralia_.

  How are the resemblances and differences of the three to be explained?
  By Aristotle's gradual method of composition. All three are great
  works, contributing to the origin of the independent science of
  Ethics. But the _Eudemian Ethics_ and the _Magna Moralia_ are more
  rudimentary than the _Nicomachean Ethics_, which as it were seems to
  absorb them except in the conclusion. They are, in short, neither
  independent works, nor mere commentaries, but Aristotle's first drafts
  of his Ethics.

  In the _Ethics to Eudemus_, as Porphyry properly called the _Eudemian
  Ethics_, Aristotle in the first four books successively investigates
  happiness, virtue, the voluntary and the particular moral virtues, in
  the same order and in the same letter and spirit as in his _Ethics to
  Nicomachus_. But the investigations are never so good. They are all
  such rudiments as Aristotle might well polish into the more developed
  expositions in the first four books of the _Nicomachean Ethics_. On
  the other hand, nobody would have gone back afterwards on his masterly
  treatment of happiness, in the first book, or of virtue in the second,
  or of the voluntary in the third, or of the particular virtues in the
  third and fourth, to write the sketchy accounts of the _Eudemian
  Ethics_.

  Again, these sketches are rough preparations for the subsequent books
  common to the two treatises. It is true, as Dr Henry Jackson has
  pointed out, though with some exaggeration, that the Eudemian agrees
  in detail rather better than the Nicomachean treatment of the
  voluntary with the subsequent discussion of injury (E.E. [Delta] =
  E.N. v. 8); and, as Th. H. Fritzsche remarks, the distinction between
  politics, and economics, and prudence in the _Eudemian Ethics_
  ([Alpha] 8) is a closer anticipation of the subsequent triple
  distinction of practical science (E.E. [Epsilon] = E.N. vi 8). On the
  other hand, there are still more fundamental points in which the first
  three books of the _Eudemian Ethics_ are a very inadequate preparation
  for the common books. Notably its treatment of prudence ([Greek:
  phronaesis]) is a chaos. At first, prudence appears as the operation
  of the philosophical life and connected with the speculative
  philosophy of Anaxagoras (E.E. [Alpha] 1-5): then it is brought into
  connexion with the practical philosophy of Socrates (_ib_. 5) and
  co-ordinated with politics and economics (_ib_. 8); then it is
  intruded into the diagram of moral virtues as a mean between villainy
  ([Greek: panourgia]) and simplicity (([Greek: euhaetheia]) (E.E.
  [Beta] 33, 1221 a 12); finally, a distinction between virtue by nature
  and virtue with prudence ([Greek: metha phronhaeseos]) is promised
  (E.E. [Tau] 7, 1234 a 4). In addition to all this confusion of
  speculative and practical knowledge, prudence is absent when it ought
  to be present; e.g. from the division of virtues into moral and
  intellectual (E.E. [Beta] 1, 1220 a 4-13), and from the definition of
  moral virtue (_ib_. 5, 10); while, in a passage ([Beta] 11)
  anticipating the subsequent discussion of the relation between
  prudence and moral virtue (E.E. [Epsilon] = E.N. vi. 12-13), it is
  stated that in purpose the end is made right by moral virtue, the
  means by another power, reason, without this right reason being stated
  to be prudence. After this, it can never be said that the earlier
  books of the _Eudemian Ethics_ are so good a preparation as those of
  the _Nicomachean Ethics_ for the distinction between prudence ([Greek:
  phrhoraesis]) and wisdom ([Greek: sophia]), which is the main point of
  the common books, and one of Aristotle's main points against Plato's
  philosophy.

  Curiously enough, although little is made of it, this distinction,
  absent from the earlier books, is present in the final book II of the
  _Eudemian Ethics_ (cf. 1246 b 4 seq., 1248 a 35, 1249 b 14); and
  probably therefore this part was a separate discourse. Meanwhile,
  however, the truth about the _Eudemian Ethics_ in general is that it
  was an earlier rudimentary sketch written by Aristotle, when he was
  still struggling, without quite succeeding, to get over Plato's view
  that there is one philosophical knowledge of universal good, by which
  not only the dialectician and mathematician must explain the being and
  becoming of the world, but also the individual and the statesman guide
  the life of man. Indeed, the final proof that the _Eudemian Ethics_ is
  earlier than the _Nicomachean_ is the very fact that it is more under
  Platonic influence. In the first place, the reason why the account of
  prudence begins by confusing the speculative with the practical is
  that the _Eudemian Ethics_ starts from Plato's _Philebus_, where,
  without differentiating speculative and practical knowledge, Plato
  asks how far good is prudence ([Greek: phronaesis]), how far pleasure
  ([Greek: haedorhae]); and in the _Eudemian Ethics_ Aristotle asks the
  same question, adding virtue ([Greek: harethae]) in order to correct
  the Socratic confusion of virtue with prudence. Secondly, the
  _Eudemian Ethics_, while not agreeing with Plato's _Republic_ that the
  just can be happy by justice alone, does not assign to the external
  goods of good fortune ([Greek: ehutuchia]) the prominence accorded to
  them in the _Nicomachean Ethics_ as the necessary conditions of all
  virtue, and the instruments of moral virtue. Thirdly, the emphasis of
  the _Eudemian Ethics_ on the perfect virtue of gentlemanliness
  ([Greek: kalokhagathia]) is a decidedly old-fashioned trait, which
  descended to Aristotle from the Greek notion of a gentleman who does
  his duty to his state (cf. Herodotus i. 30, Thucydides iv. 40) and to
  his God (Xenophon, _Symp_. iv. 49) through Plato, who in the _Gorgias_
  (470 [Epsilon]) says that the gentleman is happy, and in the
  _Republic_ (489 [Epsilon]) imputes to him the love of truth essential
  to philosophy. Moreover, when Plato goes on (_ib._ 505 [Beta]) to
  identify the form of good, without which nothing is good, with the
  gentlemanly thing ([Greek: kalhon kai agathon]), without which any
  possession is worthless, he inspired into the author of the _Eudemian
  Ethics_ the very limit ([Greek: opos]) of good fortune and
  gentlemanliness with which it concludes, only without Plato's
  elevation of the good into the form of the good. In the _Nicomachean
  Ethics_ the old notion, we gladly see, survives (cf. i. 8): virtuous
  actions are gentlemanly actions, and happiness accordingly is being at
  our best and noblest and pleasantest ([Greek: ariston kai kalliston
  kai aediston]). But gentlemanliness is no longer called perfect
  virtue, as in the _Eudemian Ethics_: its place has been taken by
  justice, which is perfect virtue to one's neighbour, by prudence which
  unites all the moral virtues, and by wisdom which is the highest
  virtue. Accordingly, in the end the old ideal of gentlemanliness is
  displaced by the new ideal of the speculative and practical life.

  Lastly, the _Eudemian Ethics_ derives from Platonism a strong
  theological bias, especially in its conclusion ([Eta] 14-15). The
  opposition of divine good fortune according to impulse to that which
  is contrary to impulse reminds us of Plato's point in the _Phaedrus_
  that there is a divine as well as a diseased madness. The
  determination of the limit of good fortune and of gentlemanliness by
  looking to the ruler, God, who governs as the end for which prudence
  gives its orders, and the conclusion that the best limit is the most
  conducive to the service and contemplation of God, presents the Deity
  and man's relation to him as a final and objective standard more
  definitely in the _Eudemian_ than in the _Nicomachean Ethics_, which
  only goes so far as to say that man's highest end is the speculative
  wisdom which is divine, like God, dearest to God.

  Because, then, it is very like, but more rudimentary and more
  Platonic, we conclude that the _Eudemian_ is an earlier draft of the
  _Nicomachean Ethics_, written by Aristotle when he was still in
  process of transition from Plato's ethics to his own.

  The _Magna Moralia_ contains similar evidence of being earlier than
  the _Nicomachean Ethics_. It treats the same subjects, but always in a
  more rudimentary manner; and its remarks are always such as would
  precede rather than follow the masterly expositions of the
  _Nicomachean Ethics_. This inferiority applies also to its treatment
  not only of the early part (i. 1-33 corresponding to E.N. i.-iv.), but
  also of the middle part (i. 34-11. 7 corresponding to E.N. v.-vii. =
  E.E. [Delta]-[Zeta]). In dealing with justice, it does not make it
  clear, as the _Nicomachean Ethics_ (Book v.) does, that even universal
  justice is virtue towards another (M.M. i. 34, 1193 b 1-15), and it
  omits altogether the division into distributive and corrective
  justice. In dealing with what the _Nicomachean Ethics_ (Book vi.)
  calls intellectual virtues, but the _Magna Moralia_ (i. 5, 35) virtues
  of the rational part of the soul, and right reason, it distinguishes
  (i. 35, 1196 b 34-36) science, prudence, intelligence, wisdom,
  apprehension ([Greek: upolaepsis]), in a rough manner very inferior to
  the classification of science, art, prudence, intelligence, wisdom,
  all of which are coordinate states of attaining truth, in the
  _Nicomachean Ethics_ (vi. 3). It distinguishes prudence ([Greek:
  phronaesis]) and wisdom ([Greek: sophia]) as the respective virtues of
  deliberative and scientific reason; and on the whole its account of
  prudence (cf. M.M. i. 5) is more consistent than that of the _Eudemian
  Ethics_. In these points it is a better preparation for the
  _Nicomachean Ethics_. But it falls into the confusion of first saying
  that praise is for moral virtues, and not for virtues of the reason,
  whether prudence or wisdom (M.M. i. 5, 1185 b 8-12), and afterwards
  arguing that prudence is a virtue, precisely because it is praised (i.
  35, 1197 a 16-18). In dealing with continence and incontinence, the
  same doubts and solutions occur as in the _Nicomachean Ethics_ (Book
  vii. = E.E. [Zeta]), but sometimes confusing doubts and solutions
  together, instead of first proposing all the doubts and then supplying
  the solutions as in the _Nicomachean Ethics_. Such rudimentary and
  imperfect sketches would be quite excusable in a first draft, but
  inexcusable and incredible after the _Nicomachean Ethics_ had been
  written.

  It has another characteristic which points to its being an early work
  of Aristotle, when he was still under the influence of Plato's style;
  namely its approximation to dialogue. It asks direct questions (e.g.
  [Greek: dia ti]; M.M. i. 1 repeatedly, 12; ii. 6, 7), incorporates
  direct statements of others (e.g. [Greek: phaesi], i. 12, 13; ii. 3,
  6, 7), alternates direct objections and answers (i. 34), and
  introduces conversations between the author and others, expressed
  interrogatively, indicatively and even imperatively ([Greek: all erei
  moi, ta poia diasaphaeson hygieina estin]. i. 35, 1196 b 10; cf. ii.
  10, 1208 a 20-22). The whole treatise inclines to run into dialogue.
  It is also Platonic, like the _Endemian Ethics_, in making little of
  external goods in the account of good fortune (ii. 8), and in
  emphasizing the perfect virtue of gentlemanliness (ii. 9). Indeed, in
  some respects it is more like the _Eudemian_, though in the main more
  like the _Nicomachean Ethics_. In the first book, it has the Eudemian
  distinction between prudence, virtue and pleasure (i. 3, 1184 b 5-6);
  but does not make so much of it as the distinction between prudence
  and wisdom blurred in the _Eudemian_ but defined in the _Nicomachean
  Ethics_. In the second book, it runs parallel to the _Eudemian Ethics_
  in placing good fortune and gentlemanliness (ii. 8-9), where the
  _Nicomachean Ethics_ places the speculative and the practical life;
  but it omits the theological element by denying that good fortune is
  divine grace, and by submitting gentlemanliness to no standard but
  that of right reason, when the irrational part of the soul does not
  hinder the rational part, or intellect ([Greek: nous]), from doing its
  work.

  Because, then, the _Magna Moralia_ is very like the _Nicomachean
  Ethics_, but more rudimentary, nearer to the Platonic dialogues in
  style and. to a less degree in matter, and also like the _Eudemian
  Ethics_, we conclude that it is also like that treatise in having been
  written as an earlier draft of the _Nicomachean Ethics_ by Aristotle
  himself.

  The hypothesis that the _Eudemian Ethics_, and by consequence the
  _Magna Moralia_, are later than Aristotle has arisen from a simple
  misconception, continued in a Scholium attributed to Aspasius, who
  lived in the 2nd century A.D. Nicomachean means "addressed to
  Nicomachus," and Eudemian "addressed to Eudemus"; but, as Cicero
  thought that the _Nicomachean Ethics_ was written by Nicomachus, so
  the author of the Scholium thought that the _Eudemian Ethics_, at
  least so far as the first account of pleasure goes, was written by
  Eudemus. He only thought so, however, because Aristotle could not have
  written both accounts of pleasure; and, taking for granted that
  Aristotle had written the second account of pleasure in the
  _Nicomachean Ethics_ (Book x.), he concluded that the first account
  (Book vii.) was not the work of Aristotle, but of Eudemus (_Comm. in
  Ar._ (Berlin) xix. p. 151). We have seen reason to reverse this
  argument: Aristotle did write the first account in Book vii., because
  it contains his usual theory; and, if we must choose, he did not write
  the second account in Book x. In this way, too, we get a historical
  development of the theory of pleasure: Plato and Speusippus said it is
  generation (cf. Plato's _Philebus_): Aristotle said it is psychical
  activity sometimes requiring bodily generation, sometimes not (E.N.
  vii. = E.E. [zeta]): Aristotle, or some Aristotelian, afterwards said
  that it is a supervening end completing an activity (E.N. x.).
  Secondly, some modern commentators, starting from the false conclusion
  that the definition of pleasure as activity (E.N. vii. = E.E. [zeta])
  is by Eudemus, and supposing without proof that he was also author of
  the first three books of the _Eudemian Ethics_, have further asserted
  that these are a better introduction than the first four books of the
  _Nicomachean Ethics_ to the books common to both treatises (E.N. Books
  v.-vii.= E.E. Books [Delta]-[Zeta]), and have concluded that Eudemus
  wrote these common books. But we have seen that Aristotle wrote the
  first three books of the _Eudemian_ as an earlier draft of the
  _Nicomachean Ethics_; so that, even so far as they form a better
  introduction, this will not prove the common books to be by Eudemus.
  Again, those first three books are a better introduction only in
  details; whereas in regard to the all-important subject of prudence as
  distinct from wisdom, they are so bad an introduction that the common
  book which discusses that subject at large (E.N. Book vi. = E.E. Book
  [Epsilon]) must be rather founded on the first four books of
  Aristotle's _Nicomachean Ethics_. Further, as Aristotle wrote both the
  first three Eudemian and the first four Nicomachean books, there is no
  reason why sometimes one, sometimes the other, should not be the best
  introduction to the common books by the same author. Finally, the
  common books are so integral a part of the Aristotelian system of
  philosophy that they cannot be disengaged from it: the book on justice
  (E.N. v.) quotes and is quoted in the _Politics_ (cf. 1130 b 28, 1280
  a 16, 1261 a 30); the book on intellectual virtues (E.N. vi.) quotes
  (vi. 3) the _Posterior Analytics_, i. 2, and is quoted in the
  _Metaphysics_ ([Alpha] 1); and we have seen that the book (E.N. vii.)
  which defines pleasure as activity is simply stating an Aristotelian
  commonplace. Thirdly, in order to prove that the _Eudemian Ethics_ was
  by Eudemus, it is said that in its first part it contemplates that
  there must be a limit ([Greek: oros]) for virtue as a mean (E.E.
  [Beta] 5, 1222 b 7-8), in its middle part it criticizes the
  _Nicomackean Ethics_ for not being clear about this limit (E.E.
  [Epsilon] 1), and in the end it alone assigns this limit, in the
  service and contemplation of God (E.E. [Eta] 15, 1249 b 16 seq.). This
  argument is subtle, but over-subtle. The _Eudemian_ and the
  _Nicomachean_ treatments of this subject do not really differ. In the
  _Nicomachean_ as in the _Eudemian Ethics_ the limit above moral virtue
  is right reason, or prudence, which is right reason on such matters;
  and above prudence wisdom, for which prudence gives its orders; while
  wisdom is the intelligence and science of the most venerable objects,
  of the most divine, and of God. After this agreement, there is a shade
  of difference. While the _Eudemian Ethics_ in a more theological vein
  emphasizes God, the object of wisdom as the end for which prudence
  gives its orders, the Nicomachean Ethics in a more humanizing spirit
  emphasizes wisdom itself, the speculative activity, as that end, and
  afterwards as the highest happiness, because activity of the divine
  power of intellect, because an imitation of the activity of God,
  because most dear to God. This is too fine a distinction to found a
  difference of authorship. Beneath it, and behind the curious
  hesitation which in dealing with mysteries Aristotle shows between the
  divine and the human, his three moral treatises agree that wisdom is a
  science of things divine, which the _Nicomachean Ethics_ (vi. 7)
  defines as science and intelligence of the most venerable things, the
  _Magna Moralia_ (i. 35) regards as that which is concerned with the
  eternal and the divine, and the _Eudemian Ethics_ ([Eta] 15) elevates
  into the service and contemplation of God.

Aristotle then wrote three moral treatises, which agree in the
fundamental doctrines that happiness requires external fortune, but is
activity of soul according to virtue, rising from morality through
prudence to wisdom, or that science of the divine which constitutes the
theology of his _Metaphysics_. Surely, the harmony of these three moral
gospels proves that Aristotle wrote them, and wrote the _Eudemian
Ethics_ and the _Magna Moralia_ as preludes to the Nicomachean Ethics.
When did he begin? We do not know; but there is a pathetic
suggestiveness in a passage in the _Magna Moralia_ (i. 35), where he
says, "Clever even a bad man is called; as Mentor was thought clever,
but prudent he was not." Mentor was the treacherous contriver of the
death of Hermias (345-344 B.C.). Was this passage written when Aristotle
was mourning for his friend?

4. _The Rhetoric to Alexander._--This is one of a series of works
emanating from Aristotle's early studies in rhetoric, beginning with the
_Gryllus_, continuing in the _Theodectea_ and the _Collection of Arts_,
all of which are lost except some fragments; while among the extant
Aristotelian writings as they stand we still possess the _Rhetoric to
Alexander_ ([Greek: Rhaetorikae pros Alexandron]) and the _Rhetoric_
([Greek: Techyn Rhaetorikae]). But the _Rhetoric to Alexander_ was
considered spurious by Erasmus, for the inadequate reasons that it has a
preface and is not mentioned in the list of Diogenes Laertius, and was
assigned by Petrus Victorius, in his preface to the _Rhetoric_, to
Anaximenes. It remained for Spengel to entitle the work _Anaximenis Ars
Rhetorica_ in his edition of 1847, and thus substitute for the name of
the philosopher Aristotle that of the sophist Anaximenes on his
title-page. We have therefore to ask, first who was the author, and
secondly what is the relation of the _Rhetoric to Alexander_ to the
_Rhetoric_, which nowadays alone passes for genuine.

After a dedicatory epistle to Alexander (chap, 1) the opening of the
treatise itself (chap. 2) is as follows:--"There are three genera of
political speeches; one deliberative, one declamatory, one forensic:
their species are seven; hortative, dissuasive, laudatory, vituperative,
accusatory, defensive, critical." This brief sentence is enough to prove
the work genuine, because it was Aristotle who first distinguished the
three genera (cf. _Rhet_. i. 3; Quintilian iii. 4, 1. 7, 1), by
separating the declamatory ([Greek: epideiktikon]) from the deliberative
([Greek: daempaegorikon, symbouleutikon]) and judicial ([Greek:
dikanikon]); whereas his rival Isocrates had considered that laudation
and vituperation, which Aristotle elevated into species of declamation,
run through every kind (Quintilian iv. 4), and Anaximenes recognized
only the deliberative and the judicial (Dionys. H. _de Isaeo_, 19). In
order, however, to impute the whole work to Anaximenes, Spengel took one
of the most inexcusable steps ever taken in the history of scholarship.
Without any manuscript authority he altered the very first words "three
genera" ([Greek: tria genae]) into "two genera" ([Greek: duo genae]),
and omitted the words "one declamatory" ([Greek: to de epideiktikon]).
Quintilian (iii. 4) imputes to Anaximenes two genera, deliberative and
judicial, and seven species, "hortandi, dehortandi, laudandi,
vituperandi, accusandi, defendendi, exquirendi, quod [Greek:
exetastikon] dicit." But the author of this rhetoric most certainly
recognized three genera ([Greek: tria genae]), since, besides the
deliberative and judicial, the declamatory genus constantly appears in
the work (chaps. 2 _init._, 4, 7, 18, 36, cf. [Greek: oyk agonos all
epideixeos eneka] 1440 b 13); and, if the terms for it are not always
the same, this is just what one would expect in a new discovery.
Moreover, he could recognize seven species in the _Rhetoric to
Alexander_, though he recognized only six in the _Rhetoric_, provided
the two works were not written at the same time; and as a matter of fact
even in the _Rhetoric to Alexander_ the seventh or critical species
([Greek: exetastikon]) is in process of disappearing (cf. chap. 37). As
then Anaximenes did not, but Aristotle did, recognize three genera, and
as Aristotle could as well as Anaximenes recognize seven species, the
evidence is overwhelming that the _Rhetoric to Alexander_ is the work
not of Anaximenes, but of Aristotle; on the condition that its date is
not that of Aristotle's confessedly genuine _Rhetoric_.

There is a second and even stronger evidence that the _Rhetoric to
Alexander_ is a genuine work of Aristotle. It divides (chap. 8)
evidences ([Greek: pisteis]) into two kinds (1) evidence from arguments,
actions and men ([Greek: ai men ex auton ton logon kai ton praxeon kai
ton anthropon]); (2) adventitious evidences ([Greek: ai d' epithetoi
tois legomenois kai tois prattomenois]). The former are immediately
enumerated as probabilities ([Greek: eikota]), examples ([Greek:
paradeigmara]), proofs ([Greek: tekmaeria]), considerations ([Greek:
enthomaemata]), maxims ([Greek: gnomai]), signs ([Greek: saemeia]),
refutations ([Greek: elenchoi]); the latter as opinion of the speaker
([Greek: doxa ton legontos]), witnesses ([Greek: martyriai]), tortures
([Greek: basanoi]), oaths ([Greek: orkoi]). It is confessed by Spengel
himself that these two kinds of evidences are the two kinds recognized
in Aristotle's _Rhetoric_ as (1) artificial ([Greek: entechnoi pisteis])
and (2) inartificial ([Greek: atechnoi pisteis]). Now, from the outset
of his _Rhetoric_ Aristotle himself claims to be the first to
distinguish between artificial evidences from arguments and other
evidences which he regards as mere additions; and he complains that the
composers of arts of speaking had neglected the former for the latter.
In particular, rhetoricians appeared to him to have neglected argument
in comparison with passion. No doubt, rational evidences had appeared in
books of rhetoric, as we see from Plato's _Phaedrus_, 266-267, where we
find proofs, probabilities, refutation and maxim, but mixed up with
other evidences. The point of Aristotle was to draw a line between
rational and other evidences, to insist on the former, and in fact to
found a logic of rhetoric. But if in the _Rhetoric to Alexander_, not
he, but Anaximenes, had already performed this great achievement,
Aristotle would have been the meanest of mankind; for the logic of
rhetoric would have been really the work of Anaximenes the sophist, but
falsely claimed by Aristotle the philosopher. As we cannot without a
tittle of evidence accept such a consequence, we conclude that
Aristotle formulated the distinction between argumentative and
adventitious, artificial and inartificial evidences, both in the
_Rhetoric to Alexander_ and in the _Rhetoric_; and that the former as
well as the latter is a genuine work of Aristotle, the founder of the
logic of rhetoric.

  What is the relation between these two genuine Rhetorics? The last
  event mentioned in the _Rhetoric to Alexander_ occurred in 340, the
  last in the _Rhetoric_ is the common peace ([Greek: koinae eiraenae])
  made between Alexander and the Greeks in 336 (_Rhet_. ii. 23, 1399 b
  12). The former treatise (chap. 9), under the head of examples
  ([Greek: paradeigmata]), gives historical examples of the unexpected
  in war for the years 403, 371, 358, concluding with the year 340, in
  which the Corinthians, coming with nine triremes to the assistance of
  the Syracusans, defeated the Carthaginians who were blockading
  Syracuse with 150 ships. Spengel, indeed, tries to bring the latest
  date in the book down to 330; but it is by absurdly supposing that the
  author could not have got the commonplace, "one ought to criticize not
  bitterly but gently," except from Demosthenes, _De Corona_ (§ 265). We
  may take it then that the last date in the _Rhetoric to Alexander_ is
  340; and by a curious coincidence 340 was the year when, on Philip's
  marching against Byzantium, Alexander was left behind as regent and
  keeper of the seal, and distinguished himself so greatly that Philip
  was only too glad that the Macedonians called Alexander king
  (Plutarch, _Alexander_, 9). It is possible then that Aristotle may
  have written the dedication to Alexander about 340 and treated him as
  if he were king in the dedicatory epistle. At the same time, as such
  prefaces are often forgeries, not prejudicing the body of the
  treatise, it does not really matter whether Aristotle actually
  dedicated his work to Alexander in that epistle about that year or
  not. If he did, then the _Rhetoric to Alexander_ in 340 was at least
  four years prior to the _Rhetoric_, which was as late as 336. If he
  did not, the question still remains, what is the internal relation
  between these two genuine Rhetorics? It will turn out most important.

  The relation between the two Rhetorics turns on their treatment of
  rational, argumentative, artificial evidences. Each of them, the
  probability (chap. 8), the example (chap. 9), the proof (chap. 10),
  the consideration (chap, 11), the maxim (chap. 12), the sign (chap.
  13), the refutation (chap. 14), though very like what it is in the
  _Rhetoric_, receives in the _Rhetoric to Alexander_ a definition
  slightly different from the definition in the _Rhetoric_, which it
  must be remembered is also the definition in the _Prior Analytics_.
  Strange as this point is, it is still stranger that not one of these
  internal evidences is brought into relation with induction and
  deduction. Example ([Greek: paradeigma]) is not called rhetorical
  induction, and consideration ([Greek: enthymaema]) is not called
  rhetorical syllogism, as they are in the _Rhetoric_, and in the
  _Analytics_. Induction ([Greek: epagogae]) and syllogism ([Greek:
  syllogismos]), the general forms of inference, do not occur in the
  _Rhetoric to Alexander_. In fact, this interesting treatise contains a
  rudimentary treatment of rational evidences in rhetoric and is
  therefore earlier than the _Rhetoric_, which exhibits a developed
  analysis of these rational evidences as special logical forms.
  Together, the earlier and the later _Rhetoric_ show us the logic of
  rhetoric in the making, going on about 340, the last date of the
  _Rhetoric to Alexander_, and more developed in or after 336 B.C., the
  last date of the _Rhetoric_.

  Nor is this all: the earlier _Rhetoric to Alexander_ and the later
  _Rhetoric_ show us logic itself in the making. We have already said
  that Aristotle was primarily a metaphysician. He gradually became a
  logician out of his previous studies: out of metaphysics, for with him
  being is always the basis of thinking, and common principles, such as
  that of contradiction, are axioms of things before axioms of thought,
  while categories are primarily things signified by names; out of the
  mathematics of the Pythagoreans and the Platonists, which taught him
  the nature of demonstration; out of the physics, of which he imbibed
  the first draughts from his father, which taught him induction from
  sense and the modification of strict demonstration to suit facts; out
  of the dialectic between man and man which provided him with beautiful
  examples of inference in the Socratic dialogues of Xenophon and Plato;
  out of the rhetoric addressed to large audiences, which with dialectic
  called his attention to probable inferences; out of the grammar taught
  with rhetoric and poetics which led him to the logic of the
  proposition. We cannot write a history of the varied origin of logic,
  beyond putting the rudimentary logic of the proposition in the _De
  Interpretatione_ before the less rudimentary theory of categories as
  significant names capable of becoming predicates in the _Categories_,
  and before the maturer analysis of the syllogism in the _Analytics_.
  But at any rate the process was gradual; and Aristotle was advanced in
  metaphysics, mathematics, physics, dialectics, rhetoric and poetics,
  before he became the founder of logic.

V. ORDER OF THE PHILOSOPHICAL WRITINGS

Some of Aristotle's philosophical writings then are earlier than others;
because they show more Platonic influence, and are more rudimentary;
e.g. the _Categories_ earlier than some parts of the _Metaphysics_,
because under the influence of Platonic forms it talks of inherent
attributes, and allows secondary substances which are universal; the _De
Interpretatione_ earlier than the _Analytics_, because in it the
Platonic analysis of the sentence into noun and verb is retained for the
proposition; the _Eudemian Ethics_ and the _Magna Moralia_ earlier than
the _Nicomachean Ethics_, because they are rudimentary sketches of it,
and the one written rather in the theological spirit, the other rather
in the dialectical style, of Plato; and the _Rhetoric to Alexander_
earlier than the _Rhetoric_, because it contains a rudimentary theory of
the rational evidences afterwards developed into a logic of rhetoric in
the _Rhetoric_ and _Analytics_.

It is tempting to think that we can carry out the chronological order of
the philosophical writings in detail. But in the gradual process of
composition, by which a work once begun was kept going with the rest,
although a work such as the _Politics_ (begun in 357) was begun early,
and some works more rudimentary came earlier than others, the general
body of writings was so kept together in Aristotle's library, and so
simultaneously elaborated and consolidated into a system that it soon
becomes impossible to put one before another.

  Zeller, indeed, has attempted an exact order of succession:--

    1. The logical treatises.
    2. The _Physics, De Coelo, De Generatione et Corruptione,
         Meteorologica_.
    3. _Historia Animalium, De Anima, Parva Naturalia, De Partibus
         Animalium, De Animalium Incessu, De Generatione Animalium_.
    4. _Ethics_ and _Politics_.
    5. _Poetics_ and _Rhetoric_.
    6. _Metaphysics_ (unfinished).

  But Zeller does not give enough weight either to the evidence of early
  composition contained in the _Politics_ and _Meteorology_, or to the
  evidence of subsequent contemporaneous composition contained in the
  cross-references, e.g. between the _Physics_ and the _Metaphysics_. On
  the other hand he gives too much weight to the references from one
  book to another, which Aristotle could have entered into his
  manuscripts at any time before his death. Moreover, the arrangement
  sometimes breaks down: for example, though on the whole the logical
  books are quoted without quoting the rest, the _De Interpretatione_
  (chap. 1) quotes the _De Anima_, and therefore is falsely taken by
  Zeller against its own internal evidence to be subsequent to it and
  consequently to the other logical books. Again, the _Meteorologica_
  (iii. 2, 372 b 9) quotes the _De Sensu_ (c. 3), and therefore, on
  Zeller's arguments, ought to follow one of the _Parva Naturalia_.
  Lastly, though the _Metaphysics_ often quotes the _Physics_, and is
  therefore regarded as being subsequent, it is itself quoted in the
  _Physics_ (i. 8, 191 b 29), and therefore ought to be regarded as
  antecedent. Zeller tries to get over this difficulty of
  cross-reference by detaching _Metaphysics_, Book [Delta], from the
  rest and placing it before the _Physics_. But this violent and
  arbitrary remedy is only partial. The truth is that the _Metaphysics_
  both precedes and follows the _Physics_, because it had been all along
  occupying Aristotle ever since he began to differ from Plato's
  metaphysical views and indeed forms a kind of presupposed basis of his
  whole system. So generally, the references backwards and forwards, and
  the cross-references, are really evidences that Aristotle mainly wrote
  his works not successively but simultaneously, and entered references
  as and when he pleased, because he had not published them.

  There are two kinds of quotations in Aristotle's extant works, the
  quotation of another book, and the quotation of a historical fact.
  While the former is useless to determine the sequence of books written
  simultaneously, the latter is insufficient to determine a complete
  chronological order. When Aristotle, e.g. in the _Politics_, quotes an
  event as now ([Greek: nun]), he was writing about it at that time; and
  when he quotes another event as lately ([Greek: neosti]) he was
  writing about it shortly after that time; but he might have been
  writing the rest of the _Politics_ both before and after either event.
  When he quotes the last event mentioned in the book, e.g. in the
  _Rhetoric_ (ii. 23, 1399 b 12) the "common peace" of Greece under
  Alexander in 336, he was writing as late as that date, but he might
  also have been writing the _Rhetoric_ both before it and after it.
  When he quotes what persons used to say in the past, e.g. Plato and
  Speusippus in the _Ethics_, Eudoxus and Callippus in the
  _Metaphysics_, he was writing these passages after the deaths of these
  persons; but he might have been also writing the _Ethics_ and the
  _Metaphysics_ both beforehand and afterwards. Lastly, when he is
  silent about a historical fact, the argument from silence is evidence
  only when he could not have failed to mention it; as, for example, in
  the _Constitution of Athens_, when he could not have failed to mention
  quinqueremes and other facts after 325-324. But this is in a
  historical work; whereas the argument from silence about historical
  facts in a philosophical work can seldom apply.

  The chronological order therefore is not sufficiently detailed to be
  the real order of Aristotelian writings. Secondly, the traditional
  order, which for nearly 2000 years has descended from the edition of
  Andronicus to the Berlin edition, is satisfactory in details, but
  unsatisfactory in system. It gives too much weight to Aristotle's
  logic, and too little to his metaphysics, on account of two prejudices
  of the commentators which led them to place both logic and physics
  before metaphysics. Aristotle rightly used all the sciences of his
  day, and especially his own physics, as a basis of his metaphysics.
  For example, at the very outset he refers to the _Physics_ (ii. 2)for
  his use of the four causes, material, efficient, formal and final, in
  the _Metaphysics_ ([Alpha] 2). This and other applications of the
  science of nature to the science of all being induced the commentators
  to adopt this order, and entitle the science of being the _Sequel to
  the Physics_ ([Greek: ta meta ta physica]). But Aristotle knew nothing
  of this title, the first known use of which was by Nicolaus
  Damascenus, a younger contemporary of Andronicus, the editor of the
  Aristotelian writings, and Andronicus was probably the originator of
  the title, and of the order. On the other hand, Aristotle entitles the
  science of all being "Primary Philosophy" ([Greek: protae
  philosophia]), and the science of physical being "Secondary
  Philosophy" ([Greek: deutera philosophia]), which suggests that his
  order is from Metaphysics to Physics, the reverse of his editor's
  order from Physics to Metaphysics. Thus the traditional order puts
  Physics before Metaphysics without Aristotle's authority. With some
  more show of authority it puts Logic before Metaphysics. Aristotle, on
  introducing the principle of contradiction (_Met._ [Gamma] 3), which
  belongs to Metaphysics as an axiom of being, says that those who
  attempt to discuss the question of accepting this axiom, do so on
  account of their ignorance of _Analytics_, which they ought to know
  beforehand ([Greek: proepistamenous]). He means that the logical
  analysis of demonstration in the _Analytics_ would teach them
  beforehand that there cannot be demonstration, though there must be
  induction, of an axiom, or any other principle; whereas, if they are
  not logically prepared for metaphysics, they will expect a
  demonstration of the axiom, as Heraclitus, the Heraclitean Cratylus
  and the Sophist Protagoras actually did,--and in vain. Acting on this
  hint, not Aristotle but the Peripatetics inferred that all logic is an
  instrument ([Greek: organon]) of all sciences; and by the time of
  Andronicus, who was one of them and sometimes called "the eleventh
  from Aristotle," the order, Logic-Physics-Metaphysics, had become
  established pretty much as we have it now. It is, however, not the
  real order for studying the philosophy of Aristotle, because there is
  more Metaphysics in his Physics than Physics in his Metaphysics, and
  more Metaphysics in his Logic than Logic in his Metaphysics. The
  commentators themselves were doubtful about the order: Boethus
  proposed to begin with Physics, and some of the Platonists with Ethics
  or Mathematics; while Andronicus preferred to put Logic first as
  Organon (_Scholia_, 25 b 34 seq.). None of the parties to the dispute
  had the authority of Aristotle. What do we find in his works? Primary
  philosophy, Metaphysics, the science of being, is the solid foundation
  of all parts of his philosophical system; not only in the _Physics_,
  but also in the _De Coelo_ (i. 8, 277 b 10), in the _De Generatione_
  (i. 3, 318 a 6; ii. 10, 336 b 29), in the _De Anima_ (i. 1, 403 a 28,
  cf. b 16), in the _De Partibus Animalium_ (i. 1, 641 a 35), in the
  _Nicomachean Ethics_ (i. 6, 1096 b 30), in the _De Interpretatione_
  (5, 17 a 14); and in short throughout his extant works. The reason is
  that Aristotle was primarily a metaphysician half for and half against
  Plato, occupied himself with metaphysics all his philosophical life,
  made the science of things the universal basis of all sciences without
  destroying their independence, and so gradually brought round
  philosophy from universal forms to individual substances. The
  traditional order of the Aristotelian writings, still continued in the
  Berlin edition, beginning with the logical writings on page 1,
  proceeding to the physical writings on page 184, and postponing the
  Metaphysics to page 980, is not the real order of Aristotle's
  philosophy.

The real order of Aristotle's philosophy is that of Aristotle's mind,
revealed in his writings, and by the general view of thinking, science,
philosophy and all learning therein contained. He classified thinking
(_Met._ [Epsilon] 1) and science (_Topics_, vi. 6) by the three
operations of speculation ([Greek: theoria]), practice ([Greek: praxis])
and production ([Greek: poiaesis]), and made the following
subdivisions:--

  I. Speculative: about things; subdivided (_Met._ [Epsilon] 1; _De An._
           i. 1) into:--
      i. Primary Philosophy, Theology, also called Wisdom, about things
           as things.
     ii. Mathematical Philosophy, about quantitative things in the
           abstract.
    iii. Physical Philosophy, about things as changing, and therefore
           about natural substances or bodies, composed of matter and
           essence.

  II. Practical or Political Philosophy, or philosophy of things human
         (cf. E.N. x. 9-fin.): about human good; subdivided (E.N. vi.
         8, cf. E.E. [Alpha] 8, 1218 b 13) into:--
      i. Ethics, about the good of the individual.
     ii. Economics, about the good of the family.
    iii. Politics, about the general good of the state.

  III. Productive, or Art ([Greek: technae]): about works produced;
          subdivided (_Met._ A. 1, 981 b 17-20) into:--
      i. Necessary ([Greek: pros tanagkaia]), e.g. medicine.
     ii. Fine ([Greek: pros diagogaen]), e.g. poetry.

Aristotle calls all these investigations sciences ([Greek: epistaemai]):
but he also uses the term "sciences" in a narrower sense in consequence
of a classification of their objects, which pervades his writings, into
things necessary and things contingent, as follows.--

  (A) The necessary ([Greek: to mae endechomenon allos echein]), what
            must be; subdivided into:--
    (1) Absolutely ([Greek: haplos]), e.g. the mathematical.
    (2) Hypothetically ([Greek: ex hypotheseus]), e.g. matter necessary
          as means to an end.

  (B) The contingent ([Greek: to endechomenon allos echein]), what may
           be; subdivided into:--
    (1) The usual ([Greek: to hos epi to polu]) or natural ([Greek: to
          physikon]), e.g. a man grows grey.
    (2) The accidental ([Greek: to kata symbebaekos]), e.g. a man sits or
          not.

Now, according to Aristotle, science in the narrow sense is concerned
only with the absolutely necessary (E.N. iii. 3), and in the
classification would stop at mathematics, which we still call exact
science: in the wide sense, on the other hand, it extends to the whole
of the necessary and to the usual contingent, but excludes the
accidental (_Met._ [Epsilon] 2), and would in the classification include
not only metaphysics and mathematics, but also physics, ethics,
economics, politics, necessary and fine art; or in short all
speculative, practical and productive thinking of a systematic kind.
Hence the _Posterior Analytics_, which is Aristotle's authoritative
logic of science, is of peculiar interest because, after beginning by
defining science as investigating necessary objects from necessary
principles (i. 4), it proceeds to say that it is either of the necessary
or of the usual though not of the accidental (i. 29), and to admit that
its principles are some necessary and some contingent (i. 32, 88 b 7).
Philosophy ([Greek: philosophia]) also is used by him in a similar
manner. Though occasionally he means by it primary philosophy (_Met._
[Gamma] 2-3, [Kappa] 3), more frequently he extends it to all three
speculative philosophies ([Epsilon] 1, 1026 a 18, [Greek: treis an eien
philosophiai theoraetikai, mathaematikae, physikae, theologikae]), and
to all three practical philosophies, as we see from the constant use of
the phrase "political philosopher" in the _Ethics_; and in short applies
it to all sciences except productive science or art. With him, as with
the Greeks generally, the problems of philosophy are the nature and
origin of being and of good: it is not as with too many of us a mere
science of mind.

Aristotle's view of thinking in science and philosophy is essentially
comprehensive; but it is not so wide as to become indefinite. According
to him, science at its widest selects a special subject, e.g. number in
arithmetic, magnitude in geometry, stars in astronomy, a man's good in
ethics; concentrates itself on the causes and appropriate principles of
its subject, especially the definition of the subject and its species by
their essences or formal causes; and after an inductive intelligence of
those principles proceeds by a deductive demonstration from definitions
to consequences: philosophy is simply a desire of this definite
knowledge of causes and effects. Beyond philosophy, not beyond science,
there is art; and beyond philosophy and science there is history, the
description of facts preparatory to philosophy, the investigation of
causes (cf. _Pr. An._ i. 30); and this may be natural history,
preparatory to natural philosophy, as in the _History of Animals_
preparatory to the _De Partibus Animalium_, or what we call civil
history, preparatory to political philosophy, as in the 158
Constitutions more or less preparatory to the _Politics_.

Wide as is all his knowledge of facts and causes, it does not appear to
Aristotle to be the whole of learning and the show of it. Beyond
knowledge lies opinion, beyond discovery disputation, beyond philosophy
and science dialectic between man and man, which was much practised by
the Greeks in the dialogues of Socrates, Plato, the Megarians and
Aristotle himself in his early manhood. With Plato, who thought that the
interrogation of man is the best instrument of truth, dialectic was
exaggerated into a universal science of everything that is. Aristotle,
on the other hand, learnt to distinguish dialectic ([Greek:
dialektikae]) from science ([Greek: epotaemae]); in that it has no
definite subject, else it would not ask questions (_Post. An._ i. 11, 77
a 31-33); in that for appropriate principles it substitutes the
probabilities of authority ([Greek: ta hendoxa]) which are the opinions
of all, or of the majority, or of the wise (_Top._ i. 1, 100 b 21-23);
and in that it is not like science a deduction from true and primary
principles of a definite subject to true consequences, but a deduction
from opinion to opinion, which may be true or false. Sophistry appeared
to him to be like it, except that it is a fallacious deduction either
from merely apparent probabilities in its matter or itself merely
apparently syllogistic in its form (cf. _Topics_, i. 1). Moreover, he
compared dialectic and sophistry, on account of their generality, with
primary philosophy in the _Metaphysics_ ([Gamma] 2, 1004 b 17-26); to
the effect that all three concern themselves with all things, but that
about everything metaphysics is scientific, dialectic tentative,
sophistry apparent, not real. He means that a sophist like Protagoras
will teach superficially anything as wisdom for money; and that even a
dialectician like Plato will write a dialogue, such as the _Republic_,
nominally about justice, but really about all things from the generality
of the form of good, instead of from appropriate moral principles; but
that a primary philosopher selects as a definite subject all things as
such without interfering with the special sciences of different things
each in its kind (_Met._ [Gamma] 1), and investigates the axioms or
common principles of things as things (_ib._ 3), without pretending,
like Plato, to deduce from any common principle the special principles
of each science (_Post. An._ i. 9, 32). Aristotle at once maintains the
primacy of metaphysics and vindicates the independence of the special
sciences. He is at the same time the only Greek philosopher who clearly
discriminated discovery and disputation, science and dialectic, the
knowledge of a definite subject from its appropriate principles and the
discussion of anything whatever from opinions and authority. On one side
he places science and philosophy, on the other dialectic and sophistry.

Such is the great mind of Aristotle manifested in the large map of
learning, by which we have now to determine the order of his extant
philosophical writings, with a view to studying them in their real
order, which is neither chronological nor traditional, but philosophical
and scientific. Turning over the pages of the Berlin edition, but
passing over works which are perhaps spurious, we should put first and
foremost speculative philosophy, and therein the primary philosophy of
his _Metaphysics_ (980 a 21-1093 b 29); then the secondary philosophy of
his _Physics_, followed by his other physical works, general and
biological, including among the latter the _Historia Animalium_ as
preparatory to the _De Partibus Animalium_, and the _De Anima_ and
_Parva Naturalia_, which he called "physical" but we call
"psychological" (184 a 10-967 b 27); next, the practical philosophy of
the _Ethics_, including the _Eudemian Ethics_ and the _Magna Moralia_ as
earlier and the _Nicomachean Ethics_ as later (1094-1249 b 25), and of
the _Politics_ (1252-1342), with the addition of the newly discovered
_Athenian Constitution_ as ancillary to it; finally, the productive
science, or art, of the _Rhetoric_, including the earlier _Rhetoric to
Alexander_ and the later _Rhetorical Art_, and of the _Poetics_, which
was unfinished (1354-end). This is the real order of Aristotle's system,
based on his own theory and classification of sciences.

But what has become of Logic, with which the traditional order of
Andronicus begins Aristotle's works (1-148 b 8)? So far from coming
first, Logic comes nowhere in his classification of science. Aristotle
was the founder of Logic; because, though others, and especially Plato,
had made occasional remarks about reason ([Greek: logos]), Aristotle was
the first to conceive it as a definite subject of investigation. As he
says at the end of the _Sophistical Elenchi_ on the syllogism, he had no
predecessor, but took pains and laboured a long time in investigating
it. Nobody, not even Plato, had discovered that the process of deduction
is a combination of premisses ([Greek: syllogomos]) to produce a new
conclusion. Aristotle, who made this great discovery, must have had
great difficulty in developing the new investigation of reasoning
processes out of dialectic, rhetoric, poetics, grammar, metaphysics,
mathematics, physics and ethics; and in disengaging it from other kinds
of learning. He got so far as gradually to write short discourses and
long treatises, which we, not he, now arrange in the order of the
_Categories_ or names; the _De Interpretatione_ on propositions; the
_Analytics_, _Prior_ on syllogism, _Posterior_ on scientific syllogism;
the _Topics_ on dialectical syllogism; the _Sophistici Elenchi_ on
eristical or sophistical syllogism; and, except that he had hardly a
logic of induction, he covered the ground. But after all this original
research he got no further. First, he did not combine all these works
into a system. He may have laid out the sequence of syllogisms from the
_Analytics_ onwards; but how about the _Categories_ and the _De
Interpretatione_? Secondly, he made no division of logic. In the
_Categories_ he distinguished names and propositions for the sake of the
classification of names; in the _De Interpretatione_ he distinguished
nouns and verbs from sentences with a view to the enunciative sentence:
in the _Analytics_ he analysed the syllogism into premisses and
premisses into terms and copula, for the purpose of syllogism. But he
never called any of these a division of all logic. Thirdly, he had no
one name for logic. In the _Posterior Analytics_ (i. 22, 84 a 7-8) he
distinguishes two modes of investigation, analytically ([Greek:
analytikos]) and logically ([Greek: logikos]). But "analytical" means
scientific inference from appropriate principles, and "logical" means
dialectical inference from general considerations; and the former gives
its name to the _Analytics_, the latter suits the _Topics_, while
neither analytic nor logic is a name for all the works afterwards called
logic. Fourthly, and consequently, he gave no place to any science
embracing the whole of those works in his classification of science, but
merely threw out the hint that we should know analytics before
questioning the acceptance of the axioms of being (_Met._ [Gamma] 3).

It is a commentator's blunder to suppose that the founder of logic
elaborated it into a system, and then applied it to the sciences. He
really left the Peripatetics to combine his scattered discourses and
treatises into a system, to call it logic, and logic _Organon_, and to
put it first as the instrument of sciences; and it was the Stoics who
first called logic a science, and assigned it the first place in their
triple classification of science into logic, physics, ethics. Would
Aristotle have consented? Would he not rather have given the first place
to primary philosophy?

  Dialectic was distinguished from science by Aristotle. Is logic, then,
  according to him, not science but dialectic? The word logically
  ([Greek: logikos]) means the same as dialectically ([Greek:
  dialektikos]). But the general discussion of opinions, signified by
  both words, is only a subordinate part of Aristotle's profound
  investigation of the whole process of reasoning. The _Analytics_, the
  most important part, so far from being dialectic or logic in that
  narrow sense, is called by him not logic but analytic science ([Greek:
  analytickae elistaemae], _Rhet._ i. 4, 1359 b 10; cf, 1356 b 9, 1357 a
  30, b 25); and in the _Metaphysics_ he evidently refers to it as "the
  science which considers demonstration and science," which he
  distinguishes from the three speculative sciences, mathematics,
  physics and primary philosophy (Met. [Kappa] 1, 1059 b 9-21). The
  _Analytics_ then, which from the beginning claims to deal with
  science, is a science of sciences, without however forming any part of
  the classification. On the other hand, it does not follow that
  Aristotle would have regarded the _Topics_, which he calls "the
  investigation" and "the investigation of dialectic" ([Greek: hae
  pralmateia], _Top_, i. 1, [Greek: hae pralmateia hae peri taen
  dialektikaen], Pr. _An._ i. 30, 46 a 30), or the _De Interpretatione_,
  which he calls "the present theory" ([Greek: taes nun theorias], _De
  Int._ 6, 17 a 7), as science. In fact, as to the _Categories_ as well
  as the _De Interpretatione_, we are at a complete loss. But about the
  _Topics_ we may venture to make the suggestion that, as in describing
  consciousness Aristotle says we perceive that we perceive, and
  understand that we understand, and as he calls _Analytics_ a science
  of sciences, so he might have called the _Topics_ a dialectical
  investigation of dialectic. Now, this suggestion derives support from
  his own description of the allied art of Rhetoric. "Rhetoric is
  counterpart to dialectic" is the first sentence of the _Rhetoric_; and
  the reason is that both are concerned with common objects of no
  definite science. Afterwards dialectic and rhetoric are said to differ
  from other arts in taking either side of a question (i. 1, 1355 a
  33-35); rhetoric, since its artificial evidences involve characters,
  passions and reasoning, is called a kind of offshoot of dialectic and
  morals, and a copy of dialectic, because neither is a science of
  anything definite, but both faculties ([Greek: dynameis]) of providing
  arguments (i. 2, 1356 a 33); and, since rhetorical arguments are
  examples and enthymemes analysed in the _Analytics_, rhetoric is
  finally regarded as a compound of analytic science and of morals,
  while it is like dialectical and sophistic arguments (i. 4, 1359 b
  2-17).

  As then Aristotle himself regarded rhetoric as partly science and
  partly dialectic, perhaps he would have said that his works on
  reasoning are some science and others not, and that, while the
  investigation of syllogism with a view to scientific syllogism in the
  _Analytics_ is analytic science, the investigation of dialectical
  syllogism, in the _Topics_, with its abuse, eristical syllogism, in
  the _Sophistici Elenchi_, is dialectic. At any rate, these
  miscellaneous works on reasoning have no right to stand first in
  Aristotle's writings under any one name, logic or _Organon_. As he
  neither put them together, nor on any one definite plan, we are left
  to convenience; and the most convenient place is with the psychology
  of the _De Anima_.

  As for dialectic itself, it would have been represented by Aristotle's
  early dialogues, had they not been lost except a few fragments. But
  none of his extant writings is so much dialectic, like a Platonic
  dialogue. They contain however many relics of dialectic. The
  _Rhetoric_ is declared by him to be partly dialectic. The _Topics_ is
  at least an investigation of dialectic, which has had an immense
  influence on the method of argument. The _Magna Moralia_ almost runs
  into dialogue. Besides, all the extant works, though apparently
  didactic, are full of dialectical matter in the way of opinions
  [Greek: legomena], difficulties and doubts ([Greek:
  aporaemata],[Greek: aporiai]), solutions ([Greek: luseis]), and of
  dialectical style in the way of conversational expressions. It is
  probable also that the "extraneous discourses" ([Greek: oi exoterikoi
  logoi]) sometimes mentioned in them here mean dialectical discussions
  of a subject from opinions extraneous to its nature, as opposed to
  scientific deduction from its appropriate principles. From the eight
  passages, which refer to the extraneous discourses, we find (1) that
  Platonic forms were made by them matters of common talk ([Greek:
  tethrulaetai], _Met._ [Mu] 1, 1076a 28); (2) that time was made by
  them matter of doubts, which in this case are Aristotle's own doubts
  (_Phys._ iv. 10, 217 b 31-218 a 30); (3) that the discussions of
  Platonic forms in them and in philosophical discourses were different
  (E.E. i. 8, 1217 b 22); (4) that the ordinary distinction between
  goods of mind, body and estate is one which we make ([Greek:
  diaironmetha]) in them (E.E. ii. 1, 1218 b 34); (5) that in them
  appeared the division of soul into irrational and rational, used by
  Aristotle (E.N. i. 13, 1102 a 26), and attributed to Plato; (6) that
  the distinction between action and production accepted by Aristotle
  appeared in them (E.N. vi. 4, 1140 a 3); (7) that a distinction
  between certain kinds of rule is one which we make often ([Greek:
  diorizometha] ... [Greek: pollakis]) in them (_Pol._ 16, 1278 b 31);
  (8) that a discussion about the best life, used by Aristotle, was made
  in them (_Pol._ [Eta] 1, 1323 a 22). On the whole, the interpretation
  which best suits all the passages is that extraneous discourses mean
  any extra-scientific dialectical discussions, oral or written,
  occurring in dialogues by Plato, or by Aristotle, or by anybody else,
  or in ordinary conversation, on any subject under the sun.

  Among all the eight passages mentioned above, the most valuable is
  that from the _Eudemian Ethics_ ([Alpha] 8), which discriminates
  extraneous discourses and philosophical ([Greek: kai en tois
  ezoterikois logois kai en tois kata philosophian], 1217 b 22-23); and
  it is preceded ([Alpha] 6, 1216 b 35-37 a 17), by a similar
  distinction between foreign discourses ([Greek: allotrioi logoi]) and
  discourses appropriate to the thing ([Greek: oikeioi logoi tou
  pragmatos]), which marks even better the opposition intended between
  dialectic and philosophy. Now, as in all eight passages Aristotle
  speaks, somewhat disparagingly, of "even ([Greek: kai]) extraneous
  discourses," and as these include his own early dialogues, they must
  be taken to mean that though he might quote them, he no longer wished
  to be judged by his early views, and therefore drew a strong line of
  demarcation between his early dialogues and the mature treatises of
  his later philosophical system. Now, both were in the hands of his
  readers in the time of Andronicus. Therefore his contemporary, Cicero,
  who knew the early dialogues on _Philosophy_, the _Eudemus_ and the
  _Protrepticus_, and also among the mature scientific writings the
  _Topics_, _Rhetoric_, _Politics_, _Physics_ and _De Coelo_, to some
  extent, was justified by Aristotle's example and precept in drawing
  the line between two kinds of books, one written popularly, called
  exoteric, the other more accurately (Cic. _De Finibus_, v. 5). But
  there was no doubt a tendency to extend the term "exoteric" from the
  dialectical to the more popular of the scientific writings of
  Aristotle, to make a new distinction between exoteric and acroamatic
  or esoteric, and even to make out that Aristotle was in the habit of
  teaching both exoterically and acroamatically day by day as head of
  the Peripatetic school at Athens. Aulus Gellius in the 2nd century
  A.D. supplies the best proof of this growth of tradition in his
  _Noctes Atticae_ (xx. 5). He says that Aristotle (1) divided his
  _commentationes_ and arts taught to his pupils into [Greek: exoterika]
  and [Greek: akroatika]; (2) taught the latter in the morning walk
  ([Greek: eothinon peripaton]), the former in the evening walk ([Greek:
  deilinon peripaton]); (3) divided his books in the same manner; (4)
  defended himself against Alexander's letter, complaining that it was
  not right to his pupils to have published his acroamatic works, by
  replying in a letter that they were published and not published,
  because they are intelligible only to those who heard them. Gellius
  then quotes this correspondence, also given by Plutarch, and quotes it
  _ex Andronici philosophi libro_. The answer to the first three points
  is that Aristotle did not make any distinction between exoteric and
  acroamatic, and was not likely to have any longer taught his exoteric
  dialogues when he was teaching his mature philosophy at Athens, but
  may have alternated the teaching of the latter between the more
  abstruse and the more popular parts which had gradually come to be
  called "exoteric." As regards the last point, the authority of
  Andronicus proves that he at all events did not exaggerate his own
  share in publishing Aristotle's works; but it does not prove either
  that this correspondence between Alexander and Aristotle took place,
  or that Aristotle called his philosophical writings acroamatic, or
  that he had published them wholesale to the world.

The literary career of Aristotle falls into three periods, (1) The early
period; when he was writing and publishing exoteric dialogues, but also
tending to write didactic works, and beginning his scientific writings,
e.g. the _Politics_ in 357, the _Meteorologica_ in 356. (2) The immature
period; when he was continuing his didactic and scientific works, and
composing first drafts, e.g. the _Categories_, the _Eudemian Ethics_,
the _Magna Moralia_, the _Rhetoric to Alexander_. (3) The mature period;
when he was finishing his scientific works, completing his system, and
not publishing it but teaching it in the Peripatetic school; when he
would teach not his early dialogues, nor his immature writings and first
drafts, but mature works, e.g. the _Metaphysics_, the _Nicomachean
Ethics_, the _Rhetoric_; and above all teach his whole system as far as
possible in the real order of his classification of science.

VI. THE ARISTOTELIAN PHILOSOPHY

We have now (1) sketched the life of Aristotle as a reader and a writer
from early manhood; (2) have watched him as a Platonist, partly
imitating but gradually emancipating himself from his master to form a
philosophy of his own; (3) have traced the gradual composition of his
writings from Plato's time onwards; (4) have distinguished earlier, more
Platonic and rudimentary, from later, more independent and mature,
writings; (5) have founded the real order of his writings, not on
chronology, nor on tradition, but on his classification of science and
learning. It remains to answer the final question:--What is the
Aristotelian philosophy, which its author gradually formed with so much
labour? Here we have only room for its spirit, which we shall try to
give as if he were himself speaking to us, as head of the Peripatetic
school at Athens, and holding no longer the early views of his
dialogues, or the immature views of such treatises as the _Categories_,
but only his mature views, such as he expresses in the _Metaphysics_.
Aristotle was primarily a metaphysician, a philosopher of things, who
uses the objective method of proceeding from being to thinking. We shall
begin therefore with that primary philosophy which is the real basis of
his philosophy, and proceed in the order of his classification of
science to give his chief doctrines on:--

(1) Speculative philosophy, metaphysical and physical, including his
psychology, and with it his logic.

(2) Practical philosophy, ethics and politics.

(3) Productive science, or art.

_Things are substances_ ([Greek: ousiai]), each of which is a separate
individual ([Greek: choriston tode ti, kath ekaston]) and is variously
affected as quantified, qualified, related, active, passive and so
forth, in categories of things which are attributes ([Greek:
sumbebaekota]), different from the category of substance, but real only
as predicates belonging to some substance, and are in fact only the
substance itself affected ([Greek: auto peponthos]). The essence of each
substance, being what it is ([Greek: to tiest, to ti aen einai]), is
that substance; e.g. this rational animal, Socrates. Substances are so
similar that the individuals of a species are even the same in essence
or substance, e.g. Callias and Socrates differ in matter but are the
same in essence, as rational animals. The universal ([Greek: to
katholoy]) is real only as one predicate belonging to many individual
substances: it is therefore not a substance. There are then no separate
universal forms, as Plato supposed. There are attributes and universals,
real as belonging to individual substances, whose being is their being.
The mind, especially in mathematics, abstracts numbers, motions,
relations, causes, essences, ends, kinds; and it over-abstracts things
mentally separate into things really separate. But reality consists only
of individual substances, numerous, moving, related, active as efficient
causes, passive as material causes, essences as formal causes, ends as
final causes, and in classes which are real universals only as real
predicates of individual substances. Such is Aristotle's realism of
individuals and universals, contained in his primary philosophy, as
expressed in the _Metaphysics_, especially in Book Z, his authoritative
pronouncement on being and substance.

The individual substances, of which the universe is composed, fall into
three great irreducible kinds: nature, God, man.

I. Nature.--The obvious substances are natural substances or bodies
([Greek: physikai ousiai, somata]), e.g. animals, plants, water, earth,
moon, sun, stars. Each natural substance is a compound ([Greek:
syntheton, synthetae, ousia]) of essence and matter; its essence
([Greek: eldos, morphae, to ti esti, to ti aen einai]) being its actual
substance, its matter ([Greek: ulae]) not; its essence being
determinate, its matter not; its essence being immateriate, its matter
conjoined with the essence; its essence being one in all individuals of
a species, its matter different in each individual; its essence being
cause of uniformity, its matter cause of accident. At the same time,
matter is not nothing, but something, which, though not substance, is
potentially substance; and it is either proximate to the substance, or
primary; proximate, as a substance which is potentially different, e.g.
wood potentially a table; primary, as an indeterminate something which
is a substratum capable of becoming natural substances, of which it is
always one; and it is primarily the matter of earth, water, air, fire,
the four simple bodies ([Greek: apla somata]) with natural rectilineal
motions in the terrestrial world (_De Gen. et Cor_. ii. I seq.); while
aether ([Greek: aithaer]) is a fifth simple body, with natural circular
motion, being the element of the stars ([Greek: to ton astron
stoicheion]) in the celestial world. Each natural substance is a formal
cause, as being what it is; a material cause, as having passive power to
be changed; an efficient cause, as having active power to change, by
communicating the selfsame essence into different matter so as to
produce therein a homogeneous effect in the same species; and a final
cause, as an end to be realized. Moreover, though each natural substance
is corruptible ([Greek: phtharton]), species is eternal ([Greek:
aidion]), because there was always some individual of it to continue its
original essence (expressed by the imperfect tense in [Greek: to ti aen
einai]), which is ungenerated and incorruptible; the natural world
therefore is eternal; and nature is for ever aiming at an eternal
propagation, by efficient acting on matter, of essence as end. For even
nature does nothing in vain, but aims at final causes, which she
uniformly realizes, except so far as matter by its spontaneity ([Greek:
apo tou automatou]) causes accidental effects; and the ends of nature
are no form of good, nor even the good of man, but the essences of
natural substances themselves, and, above them all, the good God
Himself. Such is Aristotle's natural realism, pervading his metaphysical
and physical writings.

II. _God._--Nature is but one kind of being ([Greek: en gar ti genos tou
ontos ae physis], _Met._ [Gamma] 3, 1005 a 34). Above all natural
substances, the objects of natural science, there stands a supernatural
substance, the object of metaphysics as theology. Nature's boundary is
the outer sphere of the fixed stars, which is eternally moved day after
day in a uniform circle round the earth. Now, an actual cause is
required for an actual effect. Therefore, there must be a prime mover of
that prime movable, and equally eternal and uniform. That prime mover is
God, who is not the creator, but the mover directly of the heavens, and
indirectly through the planets of sublunary substances. But God is no
mechanical mover. He moves as motive ([Greek: kinei de os eromenon],
_Met._ [Lambda] 7, 1072 b 3); He is the efficient only as the final
cause of nature. For God is a living being, eternal, very good ([Greek:
zoov aision ariston], _ib._ 1072 b 29). While nature aims at Him as
design, as an end, a motive, a final cause, God's occupation ([Greek:
diagogae]) is intelligence ([Greek: noaesis]); and since essence, not
indeed in all being, but in being understood, becomes identical with
intelligence, God in understanding essence is understanding Himself; and
in short, God's intelligence is at once intelligence of Himself, of
essence and of intelligence,--[Greek: kai estin ae noaesis noaeseos
noaesis] (_Met._ [Lambda] 7, 1074 b 34). But at the same time the
essence of good exists not only in God and God's intelligence on the one
hand, but also on the other hand on a declining scale in nature, as both
in a general and in his army; but rather in God, and more in some parts
of nature than in others. Thus even God is a substance, a separate
individual, whose differentiating essence is to be a living being,
eternal and very good; He is however the only substance whose essence is
entirely without matter and unconjoined with matter; and therefore He is
a substance, not because He has or is a substratum beneath attributes,
but wholly because He is a separate individual, different both from
nature and men, yet the final good of the whole universe. Such is
Aristotle's theological realism without materialism and the origin of
all spiritualistic realism, contained in his _Metaphysics_ ([Lambda]
6-end).

III. _Man._--There is a third kind of substance, combining something
both of the natural and of the divine: we men are that privileged
species. Each man is a substance, like any other, only because he is a
separate individual. Like any natural substance, he is composed of
matter and immateriate essence. But natural substances are inorganic and
organic; and a man is an organic substance composed of an organic body
([Greek: organikon soma]) as matter, and a soul ([Greek: psychae]) as
essence, which is the primary actuality of an organic body capable of
life ([Greek: zoae]). Still a man is not the only organism; and every
organism has a soul, whose immediate organ is the spirit ([Greek:
pneuma]), a body which--analogous to a body diviner than the four
so-called elements, namely the aether, the element of the stars--gives
to the organism its non-terrestrial vital heat, whether it be a plant or
an animal. In an ascending scale, a plant is an organism with a
nutritive soul; an animal is a higher organism with a nutritive,
sensitive, orectic and locomotive soul; a man is the highest organism
with a nutritive, sensitive, orectic, locomotive and rational soul. What
differentiates man from other natural and organic substances, and
approximates him to a supernatural substance, God, is reason ([Greek:
logos]), or intellect ([Greek: nous]). Now, though only one of the
powers of the soul, intellect alone of these powers has no bodily organ;
it alone is immortal: it alone is divine. While the soul is propagated,
like any other essence, by the efficient, which is the seed, to the
matter, which is the germ, of the embryo man, intellect alone enters
from without ([Greek: thurathen]), and is alone divine ([Greek: theion],
not [Greek: theos]), because its activity communicates with no bodily
activity (_De Gen._ ii. 3, 736-737). A man then is a third kind of
substance, like a natural substance in bodily matter, like a
supernatural substance in divine reason or intellect. Such is
Aristotle's dual, or rather triple, realism, continued in his _De Anima_
and other biological writings, especially _De Generatione Animalium_,
ii.

There are three points about a man's life which both connect him with,
and distinguish him from, God. God's occupation is speculative; man's is
speculation, practice and production.

  I. _Speculation_ ([Greek: theoria]).--Since things are individuals,
  and there is nothing, and nothing universal, beyond them, there are
  two kinds of knowledge ([Greek: gnosis]), sense ([Greek: aisthaesis])
  of individuals, intellect ([Greek: nous]) of universals. Both powers
  know by being passively receptive of essence propagated by an
  efficient cause; but, while in sense the efficient cause is an
  external object ([Greek: exothen]), in intelligence it is active
  intellect ([Greek: nous to poiein]) propagating its essence in passive
  intellect ([Greek: nous pathaetikos]). Nevertheless, without sense
  there is no knowledge. Sense receives from the external world an
  essence, e.g. of white, which is really universal as well as
  individual, but apprehends it only as individual, e.g. this white
  substance: intellect thereupon discovers the universal essence but
  only in the individuals of sense. This intellectual discovery requires
  sensation and retention of sensation; so that sense ([Greek:
  aisthaesis]) receives impressions, imagination ([Greek: phantasia])
  retains them as images, intellect ([Greek: nous]) generalizes the
  universal, and, when it is intelligence of essence, is always true.

  This is the origin of knowledge, psychologically regarded (in the _De
  Anima_). Logically regarded, the origin of all teaching and learning
  of an intellectual kind is a process of induction ([Greek: epagogae])
  from particulars to universal, and of syllogism ([Greek: syllogismos])
  from universal to further particulars; induction, whenever it starts
  from sense, becomes the origin of scientific knowledge ([Greek:
  epiostaemae]); while there is also a third process of example ([Greek:
  paradeigma]) from particular to particular, which produces only
  persuasion. In acquiring scientific knowledge, syllogism cannot start
  from universals without induction, nor induction acquire universals
  without sense. At the same time, there are three species of syllogism,
  scientific, dialectical and eristical or sophistical; and in
  consequence there are different ways of acquiring premisses. In order
  to acquire the knowledge of the true and primary principles of
  scientific knowledge, and especially the intelligence of the
  universal essence of the subject, which is always true, the process of
  knowledge consists of (1) sense ([Greek: aisthaesis]), which receives
  the essence as individual, (2) memory ([Greek: mnaemae]), which is a
  retention of sensible impression, (3) experience ([Greek: empeiria]),
  which consists of a number of similar memories, (4) induction ([Greek:
  epagogae]), which infers the universal as a fact ([Greek: to oti]),
  (5) intellect ([Greek: nous]), which apprehends the principle ([Greek:
  archae]); because it is a true apprehension that the universal induced
  is the very essence and formal cause of the subject: thereupon,
  scientific syllogism ([Greek: epistaemonikos syllogismos]), making the
  definition ([Greek: horismos]) of this essence the middle term
  ([Greek: to meson]), becomes a demonstration ([Greek: apodeixis]) of
  the consequences which follow from the essence in the conclusion. Such
  then is science. In order to acquire the probabilities ([Greek: ta
  endoxa]) of opinion ([Greek: doxa]), which are the premisses of
  dialectical syllogism, the process is still induction, as in science,
  but dialectical induction by interrogation from the opinions of the
  answerers until the universal is conceded: thereupon the dialectical
  syllogism ([Greek: dialektikos syllogismos]) deduces consequent
  opinions in the conclusion. Nor does the process of acquiring the
  premisses of eristical syllogism, which is fallacious either in its
  premisses or in its process, differ, except that, when the premisses
  are fallacious, the dialectical interrogations must be such as to
  cause this fallacy. Hence, as science and dialectic are different, so
  scientific induction and syllogism must be distinguished from
  dialectical induction and syllogism. Dialectic is useful, for
  exercise, for conversation and for philosophical sciences, where by
  being critical it has a road to principles. But it is by a different
  process of sense, memory, experience, induction, intelligence,
  syllogism, that science becomes knowledge of real causes, of real
  effects, and especially of real essences from which follow real
  consequences, not beyond, but belonging to real substances. So can we
  men, not, as Plato thought, by having in our souls universal
  principles innate but forgotten, but by acquiring universal principles
  from sense, which is the origin of knowledge, arrive at judgments
  which are true, and true because they agree with the things which we
  know by sense, by inference and by science. Such is Aristotle's
  psychological and logical realism, contained in the _De Anima_ and
  logical treatises.

  2. _Practice_ ([Greek: praxis]).--In this natural world of real
  substances, human good is not an imitation of a supernatural universal
  form of the good, but is human happiness; and this good is the same
  both of the individual as a part and of the state as a whole. Ethics
  then is a kind of Politics. But in Ethics a man's individual good is
  his own happiness; and his happiness is no mere state, but an activity
  of soul according to virtue in a mature life, requiring as conditions
  moderate bodily and external goods of fortune; his virtue is (1) moral
  virtue, which is acquired by habituation, and is a purposive habit of
  performing actions in the mean determined by right reason or prudence;
  requiring him, not to exclude, but to moderate his desires; and (2)
  intellectual virtue, which is either prudence of practical, or wisdom
  of speculative intellect; and his happiness is a kind of ascending
  scale of virtuous activities, in which moral virtue is limited by
  prudence, and prudence by wisdom; so that the speculative life of
  wisdom is the happiest and most divine, and the practical life of
  prudence and moral virtue secondary and human. Good fortune in
  moderation is also required as a condition of his happiness. Must we
  then, on account of misfortunes, look with Solon at the end, and call
  no man happy till he is dead? Or is this altogether absurd for us who
  say that happiness is an activity? Virtuous activities determine
  happiness, and a virtuous man is happy in this life, in spite of
  misfortunes unless they be too great; while after death he will not
  feel the misfortunes of the living so much as to change his happiness.
  Still, for perfect happiness a man should prefer the speculative life
  of divine intellect, and immortalize ([Greek: athanatizein]) as far as
  possible. For intellect is what mainly makes a man what he is, and is
  divine and immortal.

  To turn from Ethics to Politics, the good of the individual on a small
  scale becomes on a large scale the good of the citizen and the state,
  whose end should be no far-off form of good, and no mere guarantee of
  rights, but the happiness of virtuous action, the life according to
  virtue, which is the general good of the citizen. Hence, the citizen
  of the best state is he who has the power and the purpose to be
  governed and govern for the sake of the life according to virtue.

  A right government is one which aims at the general good, whereas any
  government which aims at its own good is a deviation. Hence
  governments are to be arranged from best to worst in the following
  order:--

   I. Right governments ([Greek: orthai politeiai]), aiming at the
            general good:--
       i. Monarchy, of one excelling in virtue:
      ii. Aristocracy, of a class excelling in virtue:
     iii. Commonwealth, of the majority excelling in virtue.

  II. Deviations ([Greek: parekbaseis]), aiming at the good of the
            government:--
       i. Democracy, aiming at the good of the majority:
      ii. Oligarchy, aiming at the good of the few:
     iii. Tyranny, aiming at the good of one.

  Such is Aristotle's practical philosophy, contained in his matured
  _Nicomachean Ethics_, and his unfinished _Politics_.

  3. _Production_ ([Greek: poiaesis]).--Production differs from practice
  in being an activity ([Greek: enirgeia]; e.g. building) which is
  always a means to a work ([Greek: ergon]; e.g. a house) beyond itself.
  Productive science, or art, is an intellectual habit of true reasoning
  from appropriate principles, acquired from experiences, and applied to
  the production of the work which is the end of the art. All the arts
  are therefore at once rational and productive. They are either for
  necessity (e.g. medicine) or for occupation (e.g. poetry), the former
  being inferior to the latter. Rhetoric is a faculty on any subject of
  investigating what may be persuasive ([Greek: pithanon]), which is the
  work of no other art; its means are artificial and inartificial
  evidences ([Greek: pisteis]), and, among artificial evidences,
  especially the logical arguments of example and enthymeme. Poetry is
  the art of producing representations; (1) in words, rhythm and harmony
  ([Greek: harmonia], "harmony" in the original sense); (2) of men like
  ourselves, or better as in tragedy, or worse as in comedy; (3) by
  means of narrative as in epic, or by action as in the drama. The cause
  of poetry is man's instinct of representation and his love of
  representations caused by the pleasure of learning. Comedy is
  representation of men inferior in being ludicrous: epic is like
  tragedy a representation of superior men, but by means of narrative
  and unlimited in time: tragedy is a representation of an action
  superior and complete, in a day if possible, by means of action, and
  accomplishing by pity and fear the purgation of such passions
  (_Poetics_, 1449 b 24). Music is a part of moral education; and for
  this end we should use the most moral harmonies. But music has also
  other ends and uses, and on the whole four; namely amusement, virtue,
  occupation and purgation of the affections; for some men are liable
  more than others to pity and fear and enthusiasm, but from sacred
  melodies we see them, when they have heard those which act
  orgiastically on the soul, becoming settled by a kind of medicine and
  purgation ([Greek: katharsis]), and being relieved with pleasure.
  Finally, art is not morality, because its end is always a work of art,
  not virtuous action: on the other hand, art is subordinate to
  morality, because all the ends of art are but means to the end of
  life, and therefore a work of art which offends against morality is
  opposed to the happiness and the good of man. Such is Aristotle's
  productive science or art, contained in his _Rhetoric_ and _Poetics_,
  compared with his _Ethics_ and _Politics_.

Aristotle, even in this sketch of his system, shows himself to be the
philosopher of facts, who can best of all men bear criticism; and indeed
it must be confessed that he retained many errors of Platonism and laid
himself open to the following objections. Two substances, being
individuals, e.g. Socrates and Callias, are in no way the same, but only
similar, even in essence, e.g. Socrates is one rational animal, Callias
another. A universal, e.g. the species man, is not predicate of many
individuals ([Greek: en kata pollon], _Post. An._ i. II), but a whole
number of similar individuals, e.g. all men; and not a whole species,
but only an individual, is a predicate of such individual, e.g. Socrates
is a man, not all men, and one white thing, not all white things.
Consequently, a species or genus is not a substance, as Aristotle says
it is in the _Categories_ (inconsistently with his own doctrine of
substances), but a whole number of substances, e.g. all men, all
animals. Similarly, the universal essence of a species is not one and
the same as each individual essence, but is the whole number of similar
individual essences of the similar individuals of the species, e.g. all
rational animals. Consequently, the universal essence of a species of
substances is not one and the same eternal essence in all the
individuals of a species but only similar, and is not substance as
Aristotle calls it in the _Metaphysics_, inconsistently with his own
doctrine of substance, but is a whole number of similar substances, e.g.
all rational animals which are what all men are. Hence again, the
natural world of species and essences is not eternal, but only endures
as long as there are individual substances. Hence, moreover, a natural
substance or body as an efficient cause or force causes an effect on
another, not by propagating one eternal essence of a species into the
matter of the other, but so far as we really understand force, by their
reciprocally preventing one another from occupying the same place at the
same moment on account of the mutual resistance of any two bodies. The
essence of a natural substance, e.g. wood, is not immateriate, but is
the whole body as what it is. The matter of a natural substance is not a
primary matter which is one indeterminate substratum of all natural
substances, but is only one body as able to be changed by a force which
is another substance able to change it, e.g. a seed becoming wood, wood
becoming coal, &c. A natural substance or body, therefore, is not a
heterogeneous compound of essence and matter, but is essence as what it
is, matter as able passively to be changed, force as able actively to
change. The simple bodies which are the matter of the rest are not
terrestrial earth, water, air, fire, and a different celestial aether,
but whatever elementary bodies natural science, starting anew from
mechanics and chemistry, may determine to be the matter of all other
bodies whatever. Nature does not aim at God as end, but God, thinking
and willing ends, produces and acts on nature. Soul is not an
immateriate essence of an organic body capable, but an immateriate
conscious substance within an organic body. Sensation is not the
reception of the selfsame essence of an external body, but one's
perception of one's sentient organism as affected, and especially of its
organs resisting one another, e.g. one's lips, hands, &c., preventing
one another from occupying the same place at the same moment within
one's organism. Intelligence does not differ from sense by having no
bodily organ, but the nervous system is the bodily organ of both.
Intelligence is not active intellect propagating universal essence in
passive intellect, but only logical inference starting from sense, and
both requiring nervous body and conscious soul. It is not always a true
apprehension of essence, but often, especially in physical matter, such
as sound or heat or light, takes superficial effects to be the essence
of the thing. Aristotle did not altogether solve the question, What is,
and scarcely solved at all the question, How do we know the external
world?

We might continue to object. But at bottom there remains the fundamental
position of Aristotelianism, that all things are substances, individuals
separate though related; that some things are attributes, real only as
being some individual substance somehow affected, or, as we should say,
modified or determined; and that without individual substances there is
nothing, and nothing universal apart from individuals. There remains too
the consequence that there are different substances, separate from but
related to one another; and these substances of three irreducible kinds,
natural, supernatural, human. Aristotelianism has to be considered
against the philosophy which preceded it and against the philosophy
which has since followed it. Platonism preceded it, and was the
metaphysical doctrine that all things are supernatural--forms, gods,
souls. Idealism has since followed it, and is the metaphysical doctrine
that all things are mind and states of mind. Aristotelianism intervenes
between ancient Platonism and modern Idealism, and is the metaphysical
doctrine that all things are substances, natural and supernatural and
human. It is a philosophy of substantial things, standing as a _via
media_ between a philosophy of the supernatural and a philosophy of
mind. There are three alternatives, which may be put as questions which
every thinker must ask himself. Are the things which surround me in what
I call the environment,--the men, the animals, the plants, the ground,
the stones, the water, the air, the moon, the sun, the stars and
God--are they shadows, unsubstantial things, as formerly Platonism made
all things to be except the supernatural world of forms, gods and souls?
Or are they, as modern Idealism says, mind and states of mind? Or are
they really substances separate from, though related to, myself, who am
also a substance? The Aristotelian answer is--"Yes, all things are
substances, but not all supernatural, nor all mental; for some are
natural substances, or bodies"; and by that answer Aristotelianism
stands or falls.

  LITERATURE.--The Aristotelian philosophy is to be studied first in
  Aristotle's works, which are the best commentaries on one another; the
  best complete edition is the Berlin edition (1831-1870), by Bekker and
  Brandis, in which also are the fragments collected by V. Rose, the
  scholia collected by Brandis, and the index compiled by Bonitz. After
  reading the remains of the Peripatetic school, the Greek commentators
  should be further studied in this edition. The Latin commentators, the
  Arabians and the schoolmen show how Aristotle has been the chief
  author of modern culture; while the vindication of modern independence
  comes out in his critics, the greatest of whom were Roger and Francis
  Bacon. Since the modern discovery of the science of motion by Galileo
  which changed natural science, and the modern revolution of philosophy
  by Descartes which changed metaphysics, the study of Aristotle has
  become less universal; but it did not die out, and received a fresh
  stimulus especially from Julius Pacius, who going back through G.
  Zabarella to the Arabians, and himself gifted with great logical
  powers, always deserves study in his editions of the _Organon_ and the
  _Physics_ and in his _Doctrinae Peripateticae_. In more recent times,
  as part of the growing conviction of the essentiality of everything
  Greek, Aristotle has received marked attention. In France there are
  the works of Cousin (1835), Félix Ravaisson, who wrote on the
  _Metaphysics_ (1837-1846), and Barthélemy St Hilaire, who translated
  the _Organon_ and other works (1844 seq.). In Germany there has been a
  host of commentaries, among which we may mention the _Organon_ edited
  (1844-1846) by F. Th. Waitz (not so well as by Pacius), the _De Anima_
  edited (1833) by F.A. Trendelenburg and later by A. Torstrik, the
  _Historia Animalium_ by H. Aubert and F. Wimmer (1868), the _Ethics_
  by K.L. Michelet (1827), the _Metaphysics_ by A. Schwegler (1847) and
  (best of all) by H. Bonitz (1848), who is the most faithful of all
  commentators, because to great industry and acumen he adds the rare
  gift of confessing when he does not understand, and when he does not
  know what Aristotle might have thought. With Aristotle's works before
  one, with the _Index Aristotelicus_, and the edition and translation
  of the _Metaphysics_ by Bonitz on one side, and Zeller's _Die
  Philosophie der Griechen_, ii. 2, "Aristoteles" (trans. by Costelloe
  and Muirhead), on the other side, one can go a considerable way
  towards understanding the foundations of Aristotelianism.

  In England scholars tend to take up certain parts of Aristotle's
  philosophy. Grote indeed intended to write a general account of
  Aristotle like that of Plato; but his _Aristotle_ went little further
  than the logical writings. From Cambridge we have J.W. Blakesley's
  _Life of Aristotle_, E.M. Cope's _Rhetoric_, Dr Henry Jackson's
  _Nicomachean Ethics_, v., S.H. Butcher's _Poetics_, Hicks's _De
  Anima_, J.E. Sandys's _Athenian Constitution_, Jebb's _Rhetoric_ (ed.
  Sandys). Oxford in particular, since the beginning of the 19th
  century, has kept alive the study of Aristotle. E. Cardwell in his
  edition of the _Nicomachean Ethics_ (1828) had the wisdom to found his
  text on the Laurentian Manuscript (Kb); E. Poste wrote translations of
  the _Posterior Analytics_ and _Sophistici Elenchi_; R. Congreve edited
  the _Politics_; A. Grant edited the _Nicomachean Ethics_; E. Wallace
  translated and annotated the _De Anima_; B. Jowett translated the
  _Politics_; W.L. Newman has edited the _Politics_ in four volumes; Dr
  Ogle has translated the _De Partibus Animalium_, with notes; R. Shute
  wrote a _History of the Aristotelian Writings_; Professor J.A.
  Stewart has written _Notes on the Nicomachean Ethics_; Professor J.
  Burnet has issued an annotated edition of the _Nicomachean Ethics_,
  and W.D. Ross has translated the _Metaphysics_. All these are, or
  were, Oxford men; and it remains to mention two others: I. Bywater,
  who as an Aristotelian scholar has done much for the improvement of
  Bekker's text, especially of the _Nicomachean Ethics_ and the
  _Poetics_; and F.G. Kenyon, who has the proud distinction of having
  been the first modern editor of the [Greek: Athaenaion politeia].
