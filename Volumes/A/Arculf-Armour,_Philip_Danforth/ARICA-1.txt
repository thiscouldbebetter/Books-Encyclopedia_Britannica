ARICA (SAN MARCOS DE ARICA), a town and port of the Chilean-governed
province of Tacna, situated in 18° 28' 08" S. lat. and 70° 20' 46" W.
long. It is the port for Tacna, the capital of the province, 38 m.
distant, with which it is connected by rail, and is the outlet for a
large and productive mining district. Arica at one time had a population
of 30,000 and enjoyed much prosperity, but through civil war,
earthquakes and conquest, its population had dwindled to 2853 in 1895
and 2824 in 1902. The great earthquake of 1868, followed by a tidal
wave, nearly destroyed the town and shipping. Arica was captured, looted
and burned by the Chileans in 1880, and in accordance with the terms of
the treaty of Ancon (1883) should have been returned to Peru in 1894,
but this was not done. Late in 1906 the town again suffered severely
from an earthquake.
