ARISTIDES, of Miletus, generally regarded as the father of Greek prose
romance, flourished 150-100 B.C. He wrote six books of erotic _Milesian
Tales_ ([Greek: Milesiaka]), which enjoyed great popularity, and were
subsequently translated into Latin by Cornelius Sisenna (119-67 B.C.).
They are lost, with the exception of a few fragments, but the story of
the Ephesian matron in Petronius gives an idea of their nature. They
have been compared with the old French _fabliaux_ and the tales of
Boccaccio.
