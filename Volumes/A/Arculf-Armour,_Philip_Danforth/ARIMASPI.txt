ARIMASPI, an ancient people in the extreme N.E. of Scythia (q.v.),
probably the eastern Altai. All accounts of them go back to a poem by
Aristeas of Proconnesus, from whom Herodotus (iii. 116, iv. 27) drew his
information. They were supposed to be one-eyed (hence their Scythian
name), and to steal gold from the griffins that guarded it. In art they
are usually represented as richly dressed Asiatics, picturesquely
grouped with their griffin foes; the subject is often described by poets
from Aeschylus to Milton. They are so nearly mythical that it is
impossible to insist on the usual identification with the ancestors of
the Huns. Their gold was probably real, as gold still comes from the
Altai.
