ARIOBARZANES, the name of three ancient kings or satraps of Pontus, and
of three kings of Cappadocia and a Persian satrap.

Of the Pontic rulers two are most famous, (1) The son of Mithradates I.,
who revolted against Artaxerxes in 362 B.C. and may be regarded as the
founder of the kingdom of Pontus (q.v.). According to Demosthenes he and
his three sons received from the Athenians the honour of citizenship.
(2) The son of Mithradates III., who reigned c. 266-240 B.C., and was
one of those who enlisted the help of the invading Gauls (see GALATIA).

Of the Cappadocian rulers the best-known one ("Philo-Romaeus" on the
coins) reigned nominally from 93 to 63 B.C., but was three times
expelled by Mithradates the Great and as often reinstated by Roman
generals. Soon after the third occasion he formally abdicated in favour
of his son Ariobarzanes "Philopator," of whom we gather only that he was
murdered some time before 51. His son Ariobarzanes, called "Eusebes" and
"Philo-Romaeus," earned the gratitude of Cicero during his proconsulate
in Cilicia, and fought for Pompey in the civil wars, but was afterwards
received with honour by Julius Caesar, who subsequently reinstated him
when expelled by Pharnaces of Pontus. In 42 B.C. Brutus and Cassius
declared him a traitor, invaded his territory and put him to death.

The Persian satrap of this name unsuccessfully opposed Alexander the
Great on his way to Persepolis (331 B.C.).
