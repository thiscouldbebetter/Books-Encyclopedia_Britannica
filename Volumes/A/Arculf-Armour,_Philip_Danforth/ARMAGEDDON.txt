ARMAGEDDON, a name occurring in the Authorized Version of the English
Bible in Rev. xvi. 16. The Revised Version has Harmagedon. The form is
commonly regarded as the Greek equivalent of the Hebrew _har megiddon_,
the mountain district of Megiddo. The writer is describing the place
where the last decisive battle was to be fought at the Day of Judgment,
and Harmagedon may have been chosen as the name because the district
about Megiddo had been on several occasions the scene of great battles
(cf. Judg. iv. 6 ff., v. 19). It has, however, been suggested in the
_Zeitschrift für die Alttestamentliche Wissenschaft_, vii. 170 (1887),
that the name is for _har migdo_, "his fruitful mountain"--the mountain
land of Israel. Prof. Cheyne (_Encyc. Bibl._ s.v.) again, following
suggestions of H. Gunkel, H. Zimmern and P. Jensen, compares the dragon
of the Apocalypse with the Babylonian Tiamat, thinks that some myth is
referred to, and finds the [Greek: magedon] of [Greek: Harmagedon] in
the divine name [Greek: Yesemmigadon], a Babylonian god of the
underworld. The name of the place where Tiamat was defeated by Marduk
perhaps included that of a god of the underworld. (See ANTICHRIST.) From
the application of the word Armageddon to the great battle of the End of
Time comes the use of the phrase "an Armageddon" to express any great
slaughter or final conflict.
