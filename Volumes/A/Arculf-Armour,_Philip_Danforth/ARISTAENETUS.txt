ARISTAENETUS, Greek epistolographer, flourished in the 5th or 6th
century A.D. He was formerly identified with Aristaenetus of Nicaea (the
friend of Symmachus), who perished in an earthquake at Nicomedia, A.D.
358, but internal evidence points to a much later date. Under his name
two books of love stories, in the form of letters, are extant; the
subjects are borrowed from the erotic elegies of such Alexandrian
writers as Callimachus, and the language is a patchwork of phrases from
Plato, Lucian, Alciphron and others. The stories are feeble and insipid,
and full of strange and improbable incidents.
