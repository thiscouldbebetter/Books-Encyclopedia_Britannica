ARISTAGORAS (d. 497 B.C.), brother-in-law and cousin of Histiaeus,
tyrant of Miletus. While Histiaeus was practically a prisoner at the
court of Darius, he acted as regent in Miletus. In 500 B.C. he
persuaded the Persians to join him in an attack upon Naxos, but he
quarrelled with Megabates, the Persian commander, who warned the
inhabitants of the island, and the expedition failed. Finding himself
the object of Persian suspicion, Aristagoras, instigated by a message
from Histiaeus, raised the standard of revolt in Miletus, though it
seems likely that this step had been under consideration for some time
(see IONIA). After the complete failure of the Ionian revolt he
emigrated to Myrcinus in Thrace. Here he fell in battle (497), while
attacking Ennea Hodoi (afterwards Amphipolis) on the Strymon, which
belonged to the Edonians, a Thracian tribe. The aid given to him by
Athens and Eretria, and the burning of Sardis, were the immediate cause
of the invasion of Greece by Darius.
