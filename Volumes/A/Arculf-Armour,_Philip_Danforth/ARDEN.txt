ARDEN, FOREST OF, a district in the north of Warwickshire, England, the
"woodland" as opposed to the "felden," or "fielden," i.e. open country,
in the south, the river Avon separating the two. Originally it was part
of a forest tract of far wider extent than that within the confines of
the county, and now, though lacking the true character of a forest, it
is still unusually well wooded. The undulating surface ranges for the
most part from 250 to 500 ft. in elevation. Wide lands in this district
were held in the time of Edward the Confessor by Alwin, whose son
Thurkill of Warwick, or "of Arden," founded the family of the
Warwickshire Ardens who in Queen Elizabeth's time still held several of
the manors ascribed to Thurkill in _Domesday_. Shakespeare, whose mother
Mary Arden claimed to be of this family, knew the district well, living
as he did at Stratford; and its natural characteristics, then still
unchanged, inspired his pictures of forest life in _As You Like It_. The
name of the Forest of Arden, besides remaining a convenient designation
of a well-marked physical area, is preserved in such place-names as
Henley-in-Arden and Hampton-in-Arden.
