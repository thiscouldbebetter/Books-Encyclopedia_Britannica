ARISTIDES, QUINTILIANUS, the author of an ancient treatise on music, who
lived probably in the third century A.D. According to Meibomius, in
whose collection (_Antiq. Musicae Auc. Septem_, 1652) this work is
printed, it contains everything on music that is to be found in
antiquity. (See Pauly-Wissowa, _Realencyc._ ii. 894.)
