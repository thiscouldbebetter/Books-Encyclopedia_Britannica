ARGELANDER, FRIEDRICH WILHELM AUGUST (1799-1875), German astronomer,
was born at Memel on the 22nd of March 1799. He studied at the
university of Konigsberg, and was attracted to astronomy by F.W. Bessel,
whose assistant he became (October 1, 1820). His treatise on the path of
the great comet of 1811 appeared in 1822; he was, in 1823, entrusted
with the direction of the observatory at Åbo; and he exchanged it for a
similar charge at Helsingfors in 1832. His admirable investigation of
the sun's motion in space was published in 1837; and in the same year he
was appointed professor of astronomy in the university of Bonn, where he
died on the 17th of February 1875. He also published _Observations
Astronomicae Aboae Factae_ (3 vols., 1830-1832); _DLX Stellarum Fixarum
Positiones Mediae_ (1835); and the first seven volumes of _Astronomische
Beobachtungen auf der Sternwarte zu Benn_ (1846-1869), containing his
observations of northern and southern star-zones, and his great
_Durchmusterung_ (vols, iii,-v., 1859-1862) of 324,198 stars, from the
north pole to -2° Dec. The corresponding atlas was issued in 1863. His
observations (begun in 1838) and discussions of variable stars were
embodied in vol. vii. of the same series.
