ARDGLASS ("Green Height"): a small town of Co. Down, Ireland, in the
east parliamentary division, at the head of a rocky bay, in a
picturesque situation between two hills, 32 m. S. by E. of Belfast on a
branch of the Belfast & Co. Down railway. Pop. (1901) 501. Soon after
the Norman invasion it became of the first importance as a port, a fact
attested by the remains of no fewer than five castles in close
proximity, which give the town a picturesque aspect. There are also an
ancient church crowning the eastern hill, and a curious fortified
warehouse (called the New Works), dating probably from the 14th century,
when a trading company was established here under a grant from Henry IV.
Ardglass was a royal burgh and sent a representative to the Irish
parliament. The chief industry is the herring fishery. Ships of 500 tons
may enter the harbour at all times. In summer Ardglass is a frequented
resort of visitors; good bathing and a golf links contribute to its
attractions.
