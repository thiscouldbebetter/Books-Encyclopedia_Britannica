ARISTOBULUS, of Paneas (c. 160 B.C.), a Jewish philosopher of the
Peripatetic school. Gercke places him in the time of Ptolemy X.
Philometor (end of 2nd century), Anatolius in that of Ptolemy II.
Philadelphus, but the middle of the 2nd century is more probable. He was
among the earliest of the Jewish-Alexandrian philosophers whose aim was
to reconcile and identify Greek philosophical conceptions with the
Jewish religion. Only a few fragments of his work, apparently entitled
_Commentaries on the Writings of Moses_, are quoted by Clement, Eusebius
and other theological writers, but they suffice to show its object. He
endeavoured to prove that early Greek philosophers had borrowed largely
from certain parts of Scripture, and quoted from Linus, Orpheus, Musaeus
and others, passages which strongly resemble the Mosaic writings. These
passages, however, were obvious forgeries. It is suggested that the name
Aristobulus was taken from 2 Macc. i. 10. The hypothesis (Schlatter,
_Das neugefundene hebräische Stück des Sirach_) that it was from
Aristobulus that the philosophy of _Ecclesiasticus_ was derived is not
generally accepted.
