ARISTEAS, a somewhat mythical personage in ancient Greece, said to have
lived in the time of Cyrus and Croesus, or, according to some, ca. 690
B.C. We are chiefly indebted to Herodotus (iv. 13-15) for our knowledge
of him and his poem _Arimaspeia_. He belonged to a noble family of
Proconnesus, an island colony from Miletus in the Propontis, and was
supposed to be inspired by Apollo. He travelled through the countries
north and east of the Euxine, and visited the Hyperboreans, Issedonians
and Arimaspians, who fought against the gold-guarding griffins. An
important historical fact which seems to be indicated in his poem is the
rush of barbarian hordes towards Europe under pressure from their
neighbours. Twelve lines of the poem are preserved in Tzetzes and
Longinus. Wonderful stories are told of Aristeas. At Proconnesus, he
fell dead in a shop; simultaneously a traveller declared he had spoken
with him near Cyzicus; his body vanished; six years afterwards, he
returned. Again disappearing, 240 years later he was at Metapontum, and
commanded the inhabitants to raise a statue to himself and an altar to
Apollo, whom he had accompanied in the form of a raven, at the founding
of the city. According to Suidas, Aristeas also wrote a prose theogony.
The genuineness of his works is disputed by Dionysius of Halicarnassus.
