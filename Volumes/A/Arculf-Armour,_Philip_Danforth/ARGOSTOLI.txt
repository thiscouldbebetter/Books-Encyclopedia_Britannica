ARGOSTOLI (anc. _Cephallenia_), the capital of Cephalonia (one of the
Ionian islands), and the seat of a bishop of the Greek church. Pop.
about 10,000. It possesses an excellent harbour, a quay a mile in
length, and a fine bridge. Shipbuilding and silk-spinning are carried
on. Near at hand are the ruins of Cranii, which afford fine examples of
Greek military architecture; and at the west side of the harbour there
is a curious stream, flowing _from_ the sea, and employed to drive mills
before losing itself in caverns inland.
