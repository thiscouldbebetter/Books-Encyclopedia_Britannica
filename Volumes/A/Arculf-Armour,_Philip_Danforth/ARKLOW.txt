ARKLOW, a seaport and market town of Co. Wicklow, Ireland, in the east
parliamentary division, 49 m. S. of Dublin, by the Dublin &
South-Eastern railway. Pop. (1901) 4944. Sea-fisheries are prosecuted,
and there are oyster-beds on the coast, but the produce requires to be
freed from a peculiar flavour by the purer waters of the Welsh and
English coast before it is fit for food. The produce of the copper and
lead mines of the Vale of Avoca is shipped from the port. There are
cordite and explosives works, established by Messrs Kynoch of
Birmingham, England. In 1882 an act was passed providing for the
improvement of the harbour and for the appointment of harbour
commissioners. The town hall and the Protestant church (1899) were gifts
of the earl of Carysfort, in whose property the town is situated. There
are slight ruins of an ancient castle of the Ormondes, demolished in
1649 by Cromwell. On the 9th of June 1798 the Irish insurgents,
attacking the town, were defeated by the royal troops near Arklow
Bridge, and their leader, Father Michael Murphy, was killed.
