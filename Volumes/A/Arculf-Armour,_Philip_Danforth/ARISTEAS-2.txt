ARISTEAS, the pseudonymous author of a famous _Letter_ in which is
described, in legendary form, the origin of the Greek translation of the
Old Testament known as the Septuagint (q.v.). Aristeas represents
himself as a Gentile Greek, but was really an Alexandrian Jew who lived
under one of the later Ptolemies. Though the _Letter_ is unauthentic, it
is now recognized as a useful source of information concerning both
Egyptian and Palestinian affairs in the 2nd and possibly in the 3rd
century B.C.

  An English translation, based on a critical Greek text, was published
  by H. St J. Thackeray in the _Jewish Quarterly Review_, vol. xv. There
  are two modern editions of the Greek, one by the last named (in
  Swete's _Introduction to the Old Testament in Greek_, Cambridge,
  1900), the other by P. Wendland (Leipzig, 1900).
