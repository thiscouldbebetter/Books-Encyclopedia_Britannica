ARETHAS (c. 860-940), Byzantine theological writer and scholar,
archbishop of Caesarea in Cappadocia, was born at Patrae. He was the
author of a Greek commentary on the Apocalypse, avowedly based upon that
of Andrew, his predecessor in the archbishopric. In spite of its
author's modest estimate, Arethas's work is by no means a slavish
compilation; it contains additions from other sources, and especial care
has been taken in verifying the references. His interest was not,
however, confined to theological literature; he annotated the margins of
his classical texts with numerous scholia (many of which are preserved),
and had several MSS. copied at his own expense, amongst them the Codex
Clarkianus of Plato (brought to England from the monastery of St John in
Patmos), and the Dorvillian MS. of Euclid (now at Oxford).

  Most divergent opinions have been held as to the time in which Arethas
  lived; the reasons for the dates given above will be found succinctly
  stated in the article "Aretas," by A. Jülicher in Pauly-Wissowa's
  _Realencyclopadie der klassischen Altertumswissenschaft_ (1896). The
  text of the commentary is given in Migne, _Patrologia Graeca_, cvi.;
  see also O. Gebhardt and A. Harnack, _Texte und Untersuchungen zur
  Geschichte der altchristlichen Litt._ i. pp. 36-46 (1882), and _Vita
  Euthymii_ (patriarch of Constantinople, d. 917), ed. C. de Boor
  (1888); H. Wace, _Dictionary of Christian Biography_, i.; C.
  Krumbacher, _Geschichte der byzantinischen Litteratur_ (1897); G.
  Heinrici in Herzog-Hauck, _Realencyklopadie_ (1897).
