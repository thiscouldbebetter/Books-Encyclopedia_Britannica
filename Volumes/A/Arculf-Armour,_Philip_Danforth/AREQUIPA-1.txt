AREQUIPA, a coast department of southern Peru, bounded N. by the
departments of Ayacucho and Cuzco, E. by Puno and Moquegua, S. and W. by
Moquegua and the Pacific. It is divided into seven provinces. Area,
21,947 sq. m.; pop. (1896) 229,007. It is traversed by an important
railway line from Mollendo (Islay) to Puno, on Lake Titicaca, 325 m.
long, with extensions to Santa Rosa, Peru and La Paz, Bolivia. The
highest point reached by this line is 14,660 ft. The department includes
an arid, sand-covered region on the coast traversed by deep gorges
formed by river courses, and a partly barren, mountainous region inland
composed of the high Cordillera and its spurs toward the coast, between
which are numerous highly fertile valleys watered by streams from the
snow-clad peaks. These produce cotton, rice, sugar-cane, wheat, coffee,
Indian corn, barley, potatoes and fruit. The mountainous region is rich
in minerals, and there is a valuable deposit of borax near the capital,
Arequipa.
