ARMET (diminutive of Fr. _arme_), a form of helmet, which was developed
out of existing forms in the latter part of the 15th century. It was
round in shape, and often had a narrow ridge or comb along the top. It
had a pivoted or hinged vizor and nosepiece, and complete chin, neck and
cheek protection, closely connected with the gorget. It is distinguished
from the basinet by its roundness, and by the fact that it protects the
neck and chin by strong plates, instead of a "camail" or loose collar of
mail; from the salade and heaume by its close fit and skull-cap shape;
and from the various forms of vizored burgonets by the absence of the
projecting brim. It remained in use until the final abandonment of the
complete closed head-piece.
