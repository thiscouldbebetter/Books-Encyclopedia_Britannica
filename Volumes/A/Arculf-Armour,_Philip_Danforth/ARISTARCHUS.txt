ARISTARCHUS, of Samos, Greek astronomer, flourished about 250 B.C. He is
famous as having been the first to maintain that the earth moves round
the sun. On this account he was accused of impiety by the Stoic
Cleanthes, just as Galileo, in later years, was attacked by the
theologians. His only extant work is a short treatise (with a commentary
by Pappus) _On the Magnitudes and Distances of the Sun and Moon_. His
method of estimating the relative lunar and solar distances is
geometrically correct, though the instrumental means at his command
rendered his data erroneous. Although the heliocentric system is not
mentioned in the treatise, a quotation in the _Arenarius_ of Archimedes
from a work of Aristarchus proves that he anticipated the great
discovery of Copernicus. Further, Copernicus could not have known of
Aristarchus's doctrine, since Archimedes's work was not published till
after Copernicus's death. Aristarchus is also said to have invented two
sun-dials, one hemispherical, the so-called _scaphion_, the other plane.
