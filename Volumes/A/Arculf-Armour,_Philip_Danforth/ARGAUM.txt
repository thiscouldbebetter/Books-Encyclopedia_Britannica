ARGAUM, a village of British India in the Akola district of the Central
Provinces, 32 m. north of Akola. The village is memorable for an action
which took place on the 28th of November 1803 between the British army,
commanded by Major-General Wellesley (afterwards duke of Wellington),
and the Mahrattas under Sindhia and the raja of Berar, in which the
latter were defeated with great loss. A medal struck in England in 1851
commemorates the victory.
