ARMENTIÈRES, a town of northern France, in the department of Nord, on
the Lys, 13 m. W.N.W. of Lille on the Northern railway from that city to
Dunkirk. Pop. (1906) 25,408. The chief building is the hôtel de ville
with a 17th-century belfry. There are communal colleges for girls and
boys, a board of trade-arbitrators, a chamber of commerce and a national
technical school. The town is an important centre for the spinning and
weaving of flax and cotton; bleaching, dyeing and the manufacture of
machinery are among the other industries. Its industrial prosperity
dates from the middle ages, when, however, woollen, not cotton, goods
were the staple product.
