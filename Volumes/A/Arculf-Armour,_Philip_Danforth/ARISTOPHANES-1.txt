ARISTOPHANES, of Byzantium, Greek critic and grammarian, was born about
257 B.C. He removed early to Alexandria, where he studied under
Zenodotus and Callimachus. At the age of sixty he was appointed chief
librarian of the museum. He died about 185-180 B.C. Aristophanes chiefly
devoted himself to the poets, especially Homer, who had already been
edited by his master Zenodotus. He also edited Hesiod, the chief lyric,
tragic and comic poets, arranged Plato's dialogues in trilogies, and
abridged Aristotle's _Nature of Animals_. His arguments to the plays of
Aristophanes and the tragedians are in great part preserved. His works
on Athenian courtesans, masks and proverbs were the results of his study
of Attic comedy. He further commented on the [Greek: Pinakes] of
Callimachus, a sort of history of Greek literature. As a lexicographer,
Aristophanes compiled collections of foreign and unusual words and
expressions, and special lists (words denoting relationship, modes of
address). As a grammarian, he founded a scientific school, and in his
_Analogy_ systematically explained the various forms. He introduced
critical signs--except the obelus; punctuation prosodiacal, and
accentual marks were probably already in use. The foundation of the
so-called Alexandrian "canon" was also due to his impulse (_Sandys,
Hist. Class. Schol_., ed. 1906, i. 129 f.).
