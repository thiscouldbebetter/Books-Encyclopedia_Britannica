ARLINGTON, a township of Middlesex county in E. Massachusetts, U.S.A.
Pop. (1890) 5629; (1900) 8603, of whom 2387 were foreign-born; (1910
census) 11,187. Area, 5½ sq. m. It is served by the Boston & Maine
railway. It has pleasant residential villages (Arlington, Arlington
Heights, &c.) with attractive environs, and there is an excellent public
library (the Robbins library). At Arlington Heights there are several
well-known sanatoriums. Spy Pond (about 100 acres) is one of the
prettiest bodies of water in the vicinity of Boston. Arlington is an
important centre for market-gardening (in hot-houses), and along Mill
Brook, in the township, are several factories, including chrome works, a
large mill and a manufactory of pianoforte cases. In 1762 Arlington was
made a "precinct" of Cambridge (of which it was a part from 1635 to
1807) under the name of Menotomy. In 1807 it became a separate township
under the name (retained until 1867) of West Cambridge.
