ARIANO DI PUGLIA, a town and episcopal see, which, despite its name, now
belongs to Campania, Italy, in the province of Avellino, 1509 ft. above
sea-level, on the railway between Benevento and Foggia, 24 m. E. of the
former by rail. Pop. (1901) town, 8384; commune, 17,653. It lies in the
centre of a fertile district, but has no buildings of importance, as it
has often been devastated by earthquakes. A considerable part of the
population still dwells in caves. It has been supposed to occupy the
site of Aequum Tuticum, an ancient Samnite town, which became a
post-station on the Via Traiana[1] in Roman times; but this should
probably be sought at S. Eleuterio 5½ m. north. It was a military
position of some importance in the middle ages. Thirteen miles
south-south-east is the Sorgente Mefita, identical with the pools of
Ampsanctus (q.v.).     (T. As.)

FOOTNOTE:

  [1] This has generally been supposed to be the place referred to by
    Horace (_Sat_. i. 5. 87), as one which the metre would not allow him
    to mention by name; but H.-Nissen (_Halische Landeskunde_, Berlin,
    1902, ii. 845) proposes Ausculum instead.
