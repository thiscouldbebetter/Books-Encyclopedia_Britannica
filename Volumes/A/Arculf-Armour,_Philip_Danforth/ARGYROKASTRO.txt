ARGYROKASTRO, or ARGYROCASTRON (Turkish, _Ergeri_; Albanian _Ergir
Castri_), a town of southern Albania, Turkey, in the vilayet of Iannina.
Pop. (1900) about 11,000. Argyrokastro is finely situated 1060 ft. above
sea-level, on the eastern slopes of the Acroceraunian mountains, and
near the left bank of the river Dhrynos, a left-hand tributary of the
Viossa. It is the capital of a sanjak bearing the same name, and was
formerly important as the headquarters of the local Moslem aristocracy,
partly owing to the mountainous and easily defensible nature of the
district. It contains the ruins of an imposing castellated fort. A fine
kind of snuff, known as _fuli_, is manufactured here. Argyrokastro has
been variously identified with the ancient Hadrianopolis and Antigonea.
In the 18th century it is said to have contained 20,000 inhabitants, but
it was almost depopulated by plague in 1814. Albanian Moslems constitute
the greater part of the population.
