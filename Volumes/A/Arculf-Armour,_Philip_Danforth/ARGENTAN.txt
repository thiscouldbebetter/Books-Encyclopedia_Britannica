ARGENTAN, a town of north-western France, capital of an arrondissement
in the department of Orne, 27 m. N.N.W. of Alençon on the railway from
Le Mans to Caen. Pop. (1906) 5072. It is situated on the slope of a hill
on the right bank of the Orne at its confluence with the Ure. The town
has remains of old fortifications, among them the Tour Marguerite, and a
château, now used as a law-court, dating from the 15th century. The
church of St Germain (15th, 16th and 17th centuries) has several
features of architectural beauty, notably the sculptured northern
portal, and the central and western towers. The church of St Martin,
dating from the 15th century, has good stained glass. The handsome
modern town-hall contains among other institutions the tribunal of
commerce, the museum and the library. Argentan is the seat of a
sub-prefect, has a tribunal of first instance and a communal college.
Leather-working and the manufacture of stained glass are leading
industries. There are quarries of limestone in the vicinity. Argentan
was a viscounty from the 11th century onwards; it was often taken and
pillaged. During the Religious Wars it remained attached to the Catholic
party. François Eudes de Mézeray, the historian, was born near the town,
and a monument has been erected to his memory.
