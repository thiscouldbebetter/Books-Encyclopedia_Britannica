ARDITI, LUIGI (1822-1903), Italian musical composer and conductor, was
born in Piedmont, and studied music at the Conservatoire in Milan,
starting professionally as a violinist, and touring with Bottesini, the
double-bass player, in the United States in 1847. He began composing at
an early age, and in 1840 produced an overture, followed by an opera _I
Briganti_ in 1841, and other works. He paid frequent visits to America,
conducting the opera in New York, where he produced his _La Spia_ in
1856. In 1858 he became conductor of the opera at Her Majesty's theatre
in London, and both in London and abroad he became famous in this
capacity, having the reputation of being Madame Patti's favourite
conductor. His vocal waltz _Il Bacio_ was often sung by her. In 1896 he
published his _Reminiscences_, and after a long and active musical life
he died at Brighton on the 1st of May 1903.
