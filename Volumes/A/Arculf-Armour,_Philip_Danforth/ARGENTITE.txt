ARGENTITE, a mineral which belongs to the galena group, and is cubic
silver sulphide (Ag2S). It is occasionally found as uneven cubes and
octahedra, but more often as dendritic or earthy masses, with a blackish
lead-grey colour and metallic lustre. The cubic cleavage, which is so
prominent a feature in galena, is here present only in traces. The
mineral is perfectly sectile and has a shining streak; hardness 2.5,
specific gravity 7.3. It occurs in mineral veins, and when found in
large masses, as in Mexico and in the Comstock lode in Nevada, it forms
an important ore of silver. The mineral was mentioned so long ago as
1529 by G. Agricola, but the name argentite (from the Lat. _argentum_,
"silver") was not used till 1845 and is due to W. von Haidinger. Old
names for the species are Glaserz, silver-glance and vitreous silver. A
cupriferous variety, from Jalpa in Tabasco, Mexico, is known as
jalpaite. Acanthite is a supposed dimorphous form, crystallizing in the
orthorhombic system, but it is probable that the crystals are really
distorted crystals of argentite.     (L. J. S.)
