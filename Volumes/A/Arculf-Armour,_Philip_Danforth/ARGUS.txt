ARGUS, in ancient Greek mythology, the son of Inachus, Agenor or
Arestor, or, according to others, an earth-born hero (autochthon). He
was called Panoptes (all-seeing), from having eyes all over his body.
After performing several feats of valour, he was appointed by Hera to
watch the cow into which Io had been transformed. While doing this he
was slain by Hermes, who stoned him to death, or put him to sleep by
playing on the flute and then cut off his head. His eyes were
transferred by Hera to the tail of the peacock. Argus with his countless
eyes originally denoted the starry heavens (Apollodorus ii. 1;
Aeschylus, _P. V._ 569; Ovid, _Metam._ i. 264).

Another ARGUS, the old dog of Odysseus, who recognized his master on his
return to Ithaca, figures in one of the best-known incidents in Homer's
_Odyssey_ (xvii. 291-326).
