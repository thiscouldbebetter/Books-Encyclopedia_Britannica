ARETAEUS, of Cappadocia, a Greek physician, who lived at Rome in the
second half of the 2nd century A.D. We possess two treatises by him,
each in four books, in the Ionic dialect: _On the Causes and Indications
of Acute and Chronic Diseases, and On their Treatment_. His work was
founded on that of Archigenes; like him, he belonged to the eclectic
school, but did not ignore the theories of the "Pneumatics," who made
the heart the seat of life and of the soul.
