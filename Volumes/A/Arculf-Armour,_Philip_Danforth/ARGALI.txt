ARGALI, the Tatar name of the great wild sheep, _Ovis ammon_, of the
Altai and other parts of Siberia. Standing as high as a large donkey,
the argali is the finest of all the wild sheep, the horns of the rams,
although of inferior length, being more massive than those of _Ovis
poli_ of the Pamirs. There are several local races of argali, among
which _O. ammon hodgsoni_ of Ladak and Tibet is one of the best known.
There are likewise several nearly related central Asian species, such as
_O. sairensis_ and _O. littledalei_. (See SHEEP.)
