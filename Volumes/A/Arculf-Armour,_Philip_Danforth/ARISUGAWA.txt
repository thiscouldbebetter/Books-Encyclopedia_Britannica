ARISUGAWA, the name of one of the royal families of Japan, going back to
the seventh son of the mikado Go-Yozei (d. 1638). After the revolution
of 1868, when the mikado Mutsu-hito was restored, his uncle, Prince
Taruhito Arisugawa (1835-1895), became commander-in-chief, and in 1875
president of the senate. After his suppression of the Satsuma rebellion
he was made a field-marshal, and he was chief of the staff in the war
with China (1894-95). His younger brother, Prince Takehito Arisugawa (b.
1862), was from 1879 to 1882 in the British navy, serving in the Channel
Squadron, and studied at the Naval College, Greenwich. In the
Chino-Japanese War of 1894-95 he was in command of a cruiser, and
subsequently became admiral-superintendent at Yokosuka. Prince Arisugawa
represented Japan in England together with Marquis Ito at the Diamond
Jubilee (1897), and in 1905 was again received there as the king's
guest.
