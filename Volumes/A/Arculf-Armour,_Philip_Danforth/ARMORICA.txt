ARMORICA (AREMORICA), the Roman name, derived from two Celtic words
meaning the "seaside" (_ar_, on, and _mor_, sea), for the land of the
Armorici, roughly the peninsula of Brittany. At the time of the Roman
advance on Gaul there were five principal tribes in Armorica, the
Namneti, the Veneti, the Osismii, the Curiosolitae and the Redones. It
was subdued by Caesar, who entirely destroyed the seafaring tribe of its
south coast, the Veneti. Under the Empire it formed part of the province
of Gallia Lugudunensis (Lugdunensis). It contained hardly any towns,
though many large country houses, and was perhaps less Romanized than
the rest of Gaul. In and after the later part of the 5th century it
received many Celtic immigrants from the British Isles, fleeing (it is
said) from the Saxons; and the Celtic dialect which the Bretons still
speak is thought to owe its origin to these immigrants. (See further
BRITTANY.)
