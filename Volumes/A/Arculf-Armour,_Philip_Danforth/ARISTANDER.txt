ARISTANDER, of Telmessus in Lycia, was the favourite soothsayer of
Alexander the Great, who consulted him on all occasions. After the death
of the monarch, when his body had lain unburied for thirty days,
Aristander procured its burial by foretelling that the country in which
it was interred would be the most prosperous in the world. He is
frequently mentioned by the historians who wrote about Alexander, and
was probably the author of a work on prodigies, which is referred to by
Pliny (_Nat. Hist_. xvii. 38) and Lucian.
