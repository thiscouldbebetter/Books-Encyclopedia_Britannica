ARÊTE (O. Fr. _areste_, Lat. _arista_, ear of corn, fish-bone or spine),
a ridge or sharp edge; a French term used in Switzerland to denote the
sharp bayonet-like edge of a mountain (such as the Matterhorn), that
slopes steeply upward with two precipitous sides meeting in a long
ascending ridge. Hence the word has passed into common use to denote any
sharp mountain edge denuded by frost action above the snowline, where
the consequent angular ridges give the characteristic "house-roof
structure" of these altitudes.
