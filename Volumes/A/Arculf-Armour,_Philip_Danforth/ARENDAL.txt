ARENDAL, a seaport of Norway, in Nedenaes _amt_ (county), on the south
coast, 46 m. N.E. from Christiansand. Pop. (1900) 11,155. It rises
picturesquely above the mouth of the river Nid, with a good harbour
protected by an island from the open waters of the Skagerrack. The town
itself occupies several islets, and some of the houses are supported
above the water on piles. The chief exports are timber (very largely
exported to Great Britain), wood-pulp, sealskins and felspar. In 1879
Arendal ranked second (after Christiania) as a ship-owning port; in 1899
it had dropped to the fifth place. In and near the town are factories
for wood-pulp, paper, cotton and joinery; and at Fevig, 8 m. north-east,
a shipbuilding yard and engineering works. The neighbourhood is
remarkable for the number of beautiful and rare minerals found there;
one of these, a variety of epidote, was formerly called Arendalite.
Louis Philippe stayed here for some time during his exile.
