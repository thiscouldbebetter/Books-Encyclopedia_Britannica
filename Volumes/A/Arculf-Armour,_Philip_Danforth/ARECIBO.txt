ARECIBO, a city and port on the north coast of Porto Rico, at the mouth
of a small stream called the Rio Grande de Arecibo, and contiguous to
one of the most fertile regions of the island. Pop. (1899) 8008; of the
tributary district, about 30,000; (1910) 9612. It is connected with San
Juan, Mayaguezand Ponce by railway. It is a well-built and active
commercial city, and has a large export trade in coffee and sugar. The
harbour is an open roadstead, very dangerous to shipping in northerly
winds, and the discharge and loading of cargoes is effected by means of
lighters at considerable risk and expense. Arecibo was founded in 1788.
