ARGYRODITE, a mineral which is of interest as being that in which the
element germanium was discovered by C. Winkler in 1886. It is a silver
sulpho-germanate, Ag8GeS6, and crystallizes in the cubic system. The
crystals have the form of the octahedron or rhombic dodecahedron, and
are frequently twinned. The botryoidal crusts of small indistinct
crystals first found in a silver mine at Freiberg in Saxony were
originally thought to be monoclinic, but were afterwards proved to be
identical with the more distinctly developed crystals recently found in
Bolivia. The colour is iron-black with a purplish tinge, and the lustre
metallic. There is no cleavage; hardness 2½, specific gravity 6.2. It is
of interest to note that the Freiberg mineral was long ago imperfectly
described by A. Breithaupt under the name _Plusinglanz_, and that the
Bolivian crystals were incorrectly described in 1849 as crystallized
brongniardite. The name argyrodite is from the Greek [Greek:
argurodaes], rich in silver.

Isomorphous with argyrodite is the corresponding tin compound Ag8SnS6,
also found in Bolivia as cubic crystals, and known by the name
canfieldite. Other Bolivian crystals are intermediate in composition
between argyrodite and canfieldite.     (L. J. S.)
