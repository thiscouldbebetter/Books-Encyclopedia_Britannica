ARICINI, the ancient inhabitants of Aricia (q.v.), the form of the name
ranking them with the Sidicini, Marrucini (q.v.), &c., as one of the
communities belonging probably to the earlier or Volscian stratum of
population on the west side of Italy, who were absorbed by the Sabine or
Latin immigrants. Special interest attaches to this trace of their
earlier origin, because of the famous cult of Diana Nemorensis, whose
temple in the forest close by Aricia, beside the _lacus Nemorensis_, was
served by "the priest who slew the slayer, and shall himself be slain";
that is to say, the priest, who was called _rex Nemorensis_, held office
only so long as he could defend himself from any stronger rival. This
cult, which is unique in Italy, is picturesquely described in the
opening chapter of J.G. Frazer's _Golden Bough_ (2nd ed., 1900) where
full references will be found. Of these references the most important
are, perhaps, Strabo v. 3. 12; Ovid, _Fasti_, iii. 263-272; and
Suetonius, _Calig_. 35, whose wording indicates that the old-world
custom was dying out in the 1st century A.D. It is a reasonable
conjecture that this extraordinary relic of barbarism was characteristic
of the earlier stratum of the population who presumably called
themselves _Arici_.

  On the anthropological aspect of the cult, see also A.B. Cook,
  _Class. Rev_. xvi., 1902, p. 365, where the whole evidence is very
  fully collected; and Frazer's _Studies in the Early History of
  Kingship_ (1907), where he accepts Cook's criticism of his own earlier
  theory.     (R. S. C.)
