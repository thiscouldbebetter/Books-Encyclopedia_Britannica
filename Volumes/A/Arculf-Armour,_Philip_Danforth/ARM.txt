ARM (a common Teutonic word; the Indo-European root is _ar_, to join or
fit; cf. the Lat. _armus_, shoulder, and the plural word _arma_,
weapons, Gr. [Greek: armos], joint, and the reduplicated [Greek:
arariskein], to join), the human upper limb from the shoulder to the
wrist, and the fore limb of an animal. (See ANATOMY: _Superficial and
Artistic_, and SKELETON: _Appendicular._) The word is also used of any
projecting limb, as of a crane, or balance, of a branch of a tree, and
so, in a transferred sense, of the branch of a river or a nerve. Through
the Fr. _armes_, from the Lat. _arma_, and so in English usually in the
plural "arms," comes the use of the word for weapons of offence and
defence, and in many expressions such as "men-at-arms,"
"assault-at-arms," and the like, and for the various branches,
artillery, cavalry, infantry, of which an army is composed, the "arms of
the service." "Arms" or "armorial bearings" are the heraldic devices
displayed by knights in battle on the defensive armour or embroidered on
the surcoat worn over the armour and hence called "coats of arms." These
became hereditary and thus are borne by families, and similar insignia
are used by nations, cities, episcopal sees and corporations generally.
