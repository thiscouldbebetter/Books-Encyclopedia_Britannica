ARISTONICUS, of Alexandria, Greek grammarian, lived during the reigns of
Augustus and Tiberius. He taught at Rome and wrote commentaries and
grammatical treatises. His chief work was [Greek: Peri Saemeion
Homaerou], in which he gave an account of the "critical marks" inserted
by Aristarchus in the margin of his recension of the text of the _Iliad_
and _Odyssey_. Important fragments are preserved in the scholia of the
Venetian Codex A of the _Iliad_.
