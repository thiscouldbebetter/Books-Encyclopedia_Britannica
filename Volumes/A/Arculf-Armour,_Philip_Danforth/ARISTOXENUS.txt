ARISTOXENUS, of Tarentum (4th century B.C.), a Greek peripatetic
philosopher, and writer on music and rhythm. He was taught first by his
father Spintharus, a pupil of Socrates, and later by the Pythagoreans,
Lamprus of Erythrae and Xenophilus, from whom he learned the theory of
music. Finally he studied under Aristotle at Athens, and was deeply
annoyed, it is said, when Theophrastus was appointed head of the school
on Aristotle's death. His writings, said to have numbered four hundred
and fifty-three, were in the style of Aristotle, and dealt with
philosophy, ethics and music. The empirical tendency of his thought is
shown in his theory that the soul is related to the body as harmony to
the parts of a musical instrument. We have no evidence as to the method
by which he deduced this theory (cf. T. Gomperz, _Greek Thinkers_, Eng.
trans. 1905, vol. iii. p. 43). In music he held that the notes of the
scale are to be judged, not as the Pythagoreans held, by mathematical
ratio, but by the ear. The only work of his that has come down to us is
the three books of the _Elements of Harmony_ ([Greek: rythmika
stoicheia]), an incomplete musical treatise. Grenfell and Hunt's
_Oxyrhynchus Papyri_ (vol. i., 1898) contains a five-column fragment of
a treatise on metre, probably this treatise of Aristoxenus.

  The best edition is by Paul Marquard, with German translation and full
  commentary, _Die harmonischen Fragmente des Aristoxenus_ (Berlin,
  1868). The fragments are also given in C.W. Müller, _Frag. Hist.
  Graec._, ii. 269 sqq.; and R. Westphal, _Melik und Rhythmik d. klass.
  Hellenenthums_ (2nd vol. edited by F. Saran, Leipzig, 1893). Eng.
  trans. by H.S. Macran (Oxford, 1902). See also W.L. Mahne, _Diatribe
  de Aristoxeno_ (Amsterdam, 1793); B. Brill, _Aristoxenus' rhythmische
  und metrische Messungen_ (1871); R. Westphal, _Griechische Rhythmik
  und Harmonik_ (Leipzig, 1867); L. Laloy, _Aristoxène de Tarente et la
