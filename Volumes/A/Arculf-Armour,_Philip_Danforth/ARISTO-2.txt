ARISTO or ARISTON, of Chios (c. 250 B.C.), a Stoic philosopher and pupil
of Zeno. He differed from Zeno on many points, and approximated more
closely to the Cynic school. He was eloquent (hence his nickname "the
Siren") but controversial in tone. He despised logic, and rejected the
philosophy of nature as beyond the powers of man. Ethics alone he
considered worthy of study, and in that only general and theoretical
questions. He rejected Zeno's doctrine of desirable things, intermediate
between virtue and vice. There is only one virtue--a clear, intelligent,
healthy state of mind (_hygeia_). Aristo is frequently confounded with
another philosopher of the same name, Ariston of Iulis, in Ceos, who,
about 230 B.C., succeeded Lyco as scholarch of the Peripatetics. (See
STOICS.)
