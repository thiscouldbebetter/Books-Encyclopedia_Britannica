ARGOSY (a corruption, by transposition of letters, of the name of the
seaport Ragusa), the term originally for a carrack or merchant ship from
Ragusa and other Adriatic ports, now used poetically of any vessel
carrying rich merchandise. In English writings of the 16th century the
seaport named is variously spelt Ragusa, Aragouse or Aragosa, and ships
coming thence were named Ragusyes, Arguzes and Argosies; the last form
surviving and passing into literature. The incorrect derivation from
Jason's ship, the "Argo," is of modern origin.
