ARGENTEUIL, a town of northern France in the department of
Seine-et-Oise, on the Seine, 5 m. N.W. of the fortifications of Paris by
the railway from Paris to Mantes. Pop. (1906) 17,330. Argenteuil grew up
round a monastery, which, dating from A.D. 656, was by Charlemagne
changed into a nunnery; it was afterwards famous for its connexion with
Héloise (see ABELARD), and on her expulsion in 1129 was again turned
into a monastery. Asparagus, figs, and wine of medium quality are grown
in the district; and heavy iron goods, chemical products, clocks and
plaster are among the manufactures.
