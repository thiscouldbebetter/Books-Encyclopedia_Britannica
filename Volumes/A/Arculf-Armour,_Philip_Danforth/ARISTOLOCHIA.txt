ARISTOLOCHIA (Gr. [Greek: aristos], best, [Greek: locheia], child-birth,
in allusion to its repute in promoting child-birth), a genus of shrubs
or herbs of the natural order Aristolochiaceae, often with climbing
stems, found chiefly in the tropics. The flower forms a tube inflated at
the base. _A. Clematitis_, birthwort, is a central and southern European
species, found sometimes in England apparently wild on ruins and similar
places, but not a native. _A. Sipho_, Dutchman's pipe, or pipe vine, is
a climber, native in the woods of the Atlantic United States, and grown
in Europe as a garden plant. The flower is bent like a pipe.

A member of the same order is the _asarabacca_ (_Asarum europaeum_), a
small creeping herb with kidney-shaped leaves and small purplish
bell-shaped flowers. It is a native of the woods of Europe and north
temperate Asia, and occurs wild in some English counties. It was
formerly grown for medicinal purposes, the underground stem having
cathartic and emetic properties. An allied species, _A. canadense_, is
the Canadian snake-root, a native of Canada and the Atlantic United
States.
