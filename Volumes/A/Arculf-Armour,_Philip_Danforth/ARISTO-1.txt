ARISTO, of Pella, a Jewish Christian writer of the middle of the 2nd
century, who like Hegesippus (q.v.) represents a school of thought more
liberal than that of the Pharisaic and Essene Ebionites to which the
decline of Jewish Christianity mainly led. Aristo is cited by Eusebius
(_Hist. Eccl._ iv. 6. 3) for a decree of Hadrian respecting the Jews,
but he is best known as the writer of a _Dialogue_ (between Papiscus, an
Alexandrian Jew, and Jason, who represents the author) on the witness of
prophecy to Jesus Christ, which was approvingly defended by Origen
against the reproaches of Celsus. The little book was perhaps used by
Justin Martyr in his own _Dialogue with Trypho_, and probably also by
Tertullian and Cyprian, but it has not been preserved.

  The literature is cited in G. Krüger's _Early Christian Literature_,
