ASS (O.E. _assa_; Lat. _asinus_), a common name (the synonym "donkey" is
supposed to be derived either by analogy from "monkey," or from the
Christian name Duncan; cf. Neddy, Jack, Dicky, &c.) for different
varieties of the sub-genus _Asinus_, belonging to the horse tribe, and
especially for the domestic ass; it differs from the horse in its
smaller size, long ears, the character of its tail, fur and markings,
and its proverbial dulness and obstinacy. The ancient Egyptians
symbolized an ignorant person by the head and ears of an ass, and the
Romans thought it a bad omen to meet one. In the middle ages the Germans
of Westphalia made the ass the symbol of St Thomas, the incredulous
apostle; the boy who was last to enter school on St Thomas' day was
called the "Ass Thomas" (Gubernatis's _Zoological Mythology_, i. 362).
The foolishness and obstinacy of the ass has caused the name to be
transferred metaphorically to human beings; and the fifth proposition of
Book i. of Euclid is known as the _Pons Asinorum_, bridge of asses.
