ASCHERSLEBEN, a town of Germany, in the Prussian province of Saxony, 36
m. by rail N.W. from Halle, and at the junction of lines to Cothen and
Nienhagen. Pop. (1900) 27,245; (1905) 27,876. It contains one Roman
Catholic and four Protestant churches, a synagogue, a fine town-hall
dating from the 16th century, and several schools. The discovery of coal
in the neighbourhood stimulated and altered its industries. In addition
to the manufacture of woollen wares, for which it has long been known,
there is now extensive production of vinegar, paraffin, potash and
especially beetroot-sugar; while the surrounding district, which was
formerly devoted in great part to market-gardening, is now turned almost
entirely into beetroot fields. There are also iron, zinc and chemical
manufactures, and the cultivation of agricultural seeds is carried on.
In the neighbourhood are brine springs and a spa (Wilhelmsbad).
Aschersleben was probably founded in the 11th century by Count Esico of
Ballenstedt, the ancestor of the house of Anhalt, whose grandson, Otto,
called himself count of Ascania and Aschersleben, deriving the former
part of the title from his castle in the neighbourhood of the town. On
the death of Otto III. (1315) Aschersleben passed into the hands of the
bishop of Halberstadt, and at the peace of 1648 was, with the bishopric,
united to Brandenburg.
