ASSELIJN, HANS (1610-1660), Dutch painter, was born at Diepen, near
Amsterdam. He received instruction from Esaias Vandevelde (1587-1630),
and distinguished himself particularly in landscape and animal painting,
though his historical works and battle pieces are also admired. He
travelled much in France and Italy, and modelled his style greatly after
Bamboccio (Peter Laer). He was one of the first Dutch painters who
introduced a fresh and clear manner of painting landscapes in the style
of Claude Lorraine, and his example was speedily followed by other
artists. Asselijn's pictures were in high estimation at Amsterdam, and
several of them are in the museums of that city. Twenty-four, painted in
Italy, were engraved.
