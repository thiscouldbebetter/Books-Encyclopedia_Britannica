ASTRAGAL (from the Gr. [Greek: astragalos], the ankle-joint), an
architectural term for a convex moulding. This term is generally applied
to small mouldings, "torus" (q.v.) to large ones of the same form. The
Lesbian astragal referred to by Vitruvius, bk. iv. ch. vi., was in all
probability an astragal carved with a bead and reel enrichment.
