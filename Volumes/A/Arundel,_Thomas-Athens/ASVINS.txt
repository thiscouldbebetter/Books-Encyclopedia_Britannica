ASVINS, in Hindu mythology, twin deities of light. After Indra, Agni and
Soma, they are the most prominent divinities in the Rig-Veda, and have
more than fifty entire hymns addressed to them. Their exact attributes
are obscure. They appear to be the spirits of dawn, the earliest
bringers of light in the morning sky; they hasten on in the clouds
before Dawn and prepare the way for her. In some hymns they are called
sons of the sun; in others, children of the sky; in others, offspring of
the ocean. They are youngest of the gods, bright lords of lustre,
honey-hued. They are inseparable. The sole purpose of one hymn is to
compare them with different twin objects, such as eyes, hands, feet and
wings. They have a common wife, Surya. They are physicians, protectors
of the weak and old, especially of elderly unmarried women. They are the
friends of lovers, and bless marriages and make them fruitful.
