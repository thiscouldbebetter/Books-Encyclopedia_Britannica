ASHREF, a town of Persia in the province of Mazandaran, about 50 m. W.
of Astarabad and 5 m. inland from the Caspian Sea, in 36° 42' N. and 53°
32' E. The population is about 6000, comprising descendants of some
Georgians introduced by Shah Abbas I. (1587-1629) and a number of
Gudars, a peculiar pariah race, probably of Indian origin. The place was
without importance until 1612, when Shah Abbas began building and laying
out the palaces and gardens in the neighbourhood now collectively known
as Bagh i Shah (the garden of the shah). The palaces, completed in 1627,
are now in ruins, but the gardens with their luxuriant vegetation and
gigantic cypress and orange trees ate well worth a visit. There were
originally six separate gardens, all contained within one large wall but
separated one from another by high walls. The principal palace was the
Chehel Situn (forty pillars), destroyed by the Afghans in 1723, and,
although rebuilt by Nadir Shah in 1731, already in ruins in 1743. About
¾ m. north of the town is the Safi-abad garden, with a palace built by
Shah Safi (1629-1642) for his daughter. It is situated on a lovely
wooded hill, and was repaired and in part renovated about 1870 by
Násiru'd-Din Shah.
