ASSINIBOIN ("Stone-Cookers"), a tribe of North American Indians of
Siouan stock. Their name (see above) is said to refer to their method of
boiling water by dropping red-hot stones into it. Their former range was
between the Missouri and the middle Saskatchewan on both sides of the
Canadian frontier. In 1904 there were 1234 in the United States, all on
reservations in Montana; and in 1902 there were 1371 in Canada.
