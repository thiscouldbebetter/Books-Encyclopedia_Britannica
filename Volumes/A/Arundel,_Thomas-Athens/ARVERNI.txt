ARVERNI, the name of an ancient Gaulish tribe in the Auvergne, which
still bears its name. It resisted Caesar longer than most of Gaul; when
once vanquished it adopted Roman civilization readily. Its tribal deity,
the god of the mountain, the Puy de Dôme, rechristened in Roman phrase
Mercurius Dumias, was famous far beyond its territory. Part of his
temple has been excavated recently.
