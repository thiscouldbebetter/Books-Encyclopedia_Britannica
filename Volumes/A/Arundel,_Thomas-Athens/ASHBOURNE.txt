ASHBOURNE, a market-town in the western parliamentary division of
Derbyshire, England, 13 m. W.N.W. of Derby, on the London &
North-Western and the North Staffordshire railways. Pop. of urban
district (1901) 4039. It is pleasantly situated on rising ground between
two small valleys opening into that of the Dove, and the most beautiful
scenery of Dovedale is not far distant. The church of St Oswald is
cruciform, Early English and later; a fine building with a central tower
and lofty octagonal spire. Its monuments and brasses are of much
interest. The town has a large agricultural trade and a manufacture of
corsets. The streams in the neighbourhood are in favour with trout
fishermen. Ashbourne Hall, an ancient mansion, has associations with
"Prince Charlie," who occupied it both before and after his advance on
Derby in 1745. There are also many connexions with Dr Johnson, a
frequent visitor here to his friend Dr Taylor, who occupied a house
opposite the grammar school.
