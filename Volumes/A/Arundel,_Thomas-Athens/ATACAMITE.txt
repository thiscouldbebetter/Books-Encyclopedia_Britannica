ATACAMITE, a mineral found originally in the desert of Atacama, and
named by D. de Gallizen in 1801. It is a cupric oxychloride, having the
formula CuCl2·3Cu(OH)2, and crystallizing in the orthorhombic system.
Its hardness is about 3 and its specific gravity 3.7, while its colour
presents various shades of green, usually dark. Atacamite is a
comparatively rare mineral, formed in some cases by the action of
sea-water on various copper-ores, and occurring also as a volcanic
product on Vesuvian lavas. Some of the finest crystals have been yielded
by the copper-mines of South Australia, especially at Wallaroo. It
occurs also, with malachite, at Bembe, near Ambriz, in West Africa. From
one of its localities in Chile, Los Remolinos, it was termed Remolinite
by Brooke and Miller. Atacamite, in a pulverulent state, was formerly
used as a pounce under the name of "Peruvian green sand," and was known
in Chile as arsenillo.     (F. W. R.*)
