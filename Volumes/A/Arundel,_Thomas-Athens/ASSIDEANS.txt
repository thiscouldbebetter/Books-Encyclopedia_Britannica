ASSIDEANS (the Anglicized form, derived through the Greek, of the Hebrew
_Hasidim_, "the pious"), the name of a party or sect which stood out
against the Hellenization of the Jews in the 2nd century B.C. After the
massacre of those who fled from the forces of Antiochus Epiphanes and
would not resist on the sabbath, Mattathias (or Judas) decided to set
aside the law and was joined by a company of Assideans, brave men of
Israel every one, who offered themselves willingly for the law (1 Macc.
ii. 42, cf. 2 Macc. viii. 1). On the appointment of Alcimus (162 B.C.),
"a descendant of Aaron" as high-priest, "the Assideans were the first
who sought peace" (1 Macc. vii. 13 f.); but the treacherous murder of
sixty of them (ib. 16) threw them back into the arms of Judas. According
to 2 Macc. xiv., Alcimus identified them with the whole party of the
rebels, of which they were only one, though the most important, section.
