ASS, FEAST OF THE, formerly a festival in northern France, primarily in
commemoration of the biblical flight into Egypt, and usually held on the
14th of January. A girl with a baby at her breast and seated on an ass
splendidly caparisoned was led through the town to the church, and there
placed at the gospel side of the altar while mass was said. The ceremony
degenerated into a burlesque in which the ass of the flight became
confused with Balaam's ass. So scandalous became the popular revels
associated with it, that the celebration was prohibited by the church in
the 15th century. (See FOOLS, FEAST OF.)
