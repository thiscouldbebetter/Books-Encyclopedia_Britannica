ASTRUC, JEAN (1684-1766), French physician and Biblical critic, was born
on the 19th of March 1684 at Sauve, in Languedoc. He graduated in
medicine at Montpellier in 1703, and in 1710 he was appointed to the
chair of anatomy at Toulouse, which he retained till 1717, when he
became professor of medicine at Montpellier. Subsequently he was
appointed successively superintendent of the mineral waters of Languedoc
(1721), first physician to the king of Poland (1729), and regius
professor of medicine at Paris (1731). He died on the 5th of May 1766 at
Paris. Of his numerous works, that on which his fame principally rests
is the treatise entitled _De Morbis Venereis libri sex_, 1736. In
addition to other medical works he published anonymously _Conjectures
sur les mémoires originaux dont il parait que Moyse s'est servi pour
composer le livre de la Genèse_, (1753), in which he pointed out that
two main sources can be traced in the book of Genesis; and two
dissertations on the immateriality and immortality of the soul, 1755.
