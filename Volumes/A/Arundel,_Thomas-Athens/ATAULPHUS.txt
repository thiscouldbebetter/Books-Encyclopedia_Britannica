ATAULPHUS (the Latinized form of the Gothic Ataulf, "Father-wolf," from
_atta_, father, and _vulfs_, wolf; mod. Germ. Adolf, Latinized as
Adolphus, the form used by Gibbon for the subject of this article), king
of the Goths (d. 415). On the death of Alaric (q.v.) his followers
acclaimed his brother-in-law Ataulphus as king. In 412 he quitted Italy
and led his army across the Alps into Gaul. Here he fought against some
of the usurpers who threatened the throne of Honorius; he made some sort
of compact with that emperor and, in 414, he married his sister
Placidia, who had been since the siege of Rome a captive in the camp of
the Goths. The ex-emperor Attalus danced at the marriage festival, which
was celebrated with great pomp at Narbonne. In 415 Ataulphus crossed the
Pyrenees into Spain and died at Barcelona, being assassinated by a
groom. The most important fact in his history is his confession,
recorded by Orosius, that he saw the inability of his countrymen to rear
a civilized or abiding kingdom, and that consequently his aim should be
to build on Roman foundations and blend the two nations into one.
