ATELLA, an ancient Oscan town of Campania, 9 m. N. of Naples and 9 m. S.
of Capua, on the road between the two. It was a member of the Campanian
confederation, and shared the fortunes of Capua, but remained faithful
to Hannibal for a longer time; the great part of the inhabitants, when
they could no longer resist the Romans, were transferred by him to
Thurii, and the town was reoccupied in 211 by the Romans, who settled
the exiled inhabitants of Nuceria there. The fate of Atella at the end
of the war, when the latter were able to return to their own city, is
unknown. Cicero was in friendly relations with it, and exerted influence
that it might retain its property in Gaul, so that it is obvious that it
had then recovered municipal rights. The town is mainly famous as the
cradle of early Roman comedy, the _Fabulae Atellanae_ (see below). Some
remains of the town still exist, including a tower of the city wall in
brick.
