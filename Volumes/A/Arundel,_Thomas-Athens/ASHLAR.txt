ASHLAR, also written ASHLER, ASHELERE, &c. (probably from Lat. _axilla_,
diminutive of _axis_, an axle), hewn or squared stone, generally applied
to that used for facing walls. In a contract of date 1398 we
read--"Murus erit exterius de puro lapide vocato _achilar_, plane
incisso, interius vero de lapide fracto vocato _roghwall_." "Clene hewen
ashler" often occurs in medieval documents; this no doubt means tooled
or finely worked, in contradistinction to rough-axed faces.

An "ashlar piece" in building is an upright piece of timber framed
between the common rafters and the wall plate.
