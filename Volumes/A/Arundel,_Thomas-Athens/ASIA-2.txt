ASIA, in a restricted sense, the name of the first Roman province east
of the Aegean, formed (133 B.C.) out of the kingdom left to the Romans
by the will of Attalus III. Philometor, king of Pergamum. It included
Mysia, Lydia, Caria and Phrygia, and therefore, of course, Aeolis, Ionia
and the Troad. In 84 B.C., on the close of the Mithradatic War, Sulla
reorganized the province, forming 40 _regiones_ for fiscal purposes, and
it was later divided into _conventus_. From 80 to 50 B.C. the upper
Maeander valley and all Phrygia, except the extreme north, were detached
and added to Cilicia. In 27 B.C. Asia was made a senatorial province
under a pro-consul. As the wealthiest of Roman provinces it had most to
gain by the _pax Romana_, and therefore welcomed the empire, and
established and maintained the most devout cult of Augustus by means of
the organization known as the _Koinon_ or Commune, a representative
council, meeting in the various _metropoleis_. In this cult the emperor
came to be associated with the common worship of the Ephesian Artemis.
By the reorganization of Diocletian, A.D. 297, Asia was broken up into
several small provinces, and one of these, of which the capital was
Ephesus, retained the name of the original province (see ASIA MINOR).
