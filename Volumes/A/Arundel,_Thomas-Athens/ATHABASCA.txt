ATHABASCA (_Athiapescow_), or ELK, a river and lake Of the province of
Alberta, Canada. The river rises in the Rocky Mountains near the
Yellowhead Pass in 52° 10' N. and 117° 10' W., and flows north-east as
far as Athabasca Landing, and thence north into Lake Athabasca. It is
740 m. long and has a number of important tributaries, including the
McLeod, Pembina, Lesser Slave, which drains the lake of that name, and
Clearwater. Athabasca lake is 195 m. long, west to east, from 20 to 32
m. wide has an area of 3085 sq. m., and is 690 ft. above the sea. It
discharges its waters northward by Slave river and the Mackenzie system
to the Arctic Ocean. On its north shore the country is high and rocky;
on the south, sandy and barren. Shallow draught steamers navigate the
lake and river, and Lesser Slave lake and river, with one
interruption--at Grand Rapids near the mouth of the Clearwater river.
