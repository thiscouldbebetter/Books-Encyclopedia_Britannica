ASSIGNMENT, ASSIGNATION, ASSIGNEE (from Lat. _assignare_, to mark out),
terms which, as derivatives of the verb "to assign," are of frequent
technical use in law. To assign is to make over, and the term is
generally used to express a transference by writing, in
contradistinction to a transference by actual delivery. In England the
usual expression is assignment, in Scotland it is assignation. The
person making over is called the _assignor_ or _cedent_; the recipient,
the _assign_ or _assignee_. An assignee may be such either _by deed_, as
when a lessee assigns his lease to another, or _in law_, as when
property devolves upon an executor. The law as to assignment in
connexion with each particular subject, as the assignment of a chose in
action, assignment in contract, of dower, of errors, of a lease, &c.,
will be found under the respective headings. In a colloquial sense,
"assignation" means a secretly contrived meeting between lovers.
