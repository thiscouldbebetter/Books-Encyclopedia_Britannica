ASSEGAI, or ASSAGAI (from Berber-Arab _as-zahayah_, through Portuguese
_azagaia_), a weapon for throwing or hurling, a light spear or javelin
made of wood and pointed with iron, particularly the spear used by the
Zulu and other Kaffir tribes of South Africa. In addition to the
long-handled assegai there is a shorter weapon for use at close
quarters.
