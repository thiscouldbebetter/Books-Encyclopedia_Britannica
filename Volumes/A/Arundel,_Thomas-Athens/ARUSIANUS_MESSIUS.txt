ARUSIANUS MESSIUS, or MESSUS, Latin grammarian, flourished in the 4th
century A.D. He was the author of a small extant work _Exempla
Elocutionum_, dedicated to Olybrius and Probinus, consuls for the year
395. It contains an alphabetical list, chiefly of verbs admitting more
than one construction, with examples from each of the four writers,
Virgil, Sallust, Terence and Cicero. Cassiodorus, the only writer who
mentions Arusianus, refers to it by the term Quadriga.
