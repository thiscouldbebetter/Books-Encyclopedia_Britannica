population is largely industrial. Aston Hall, erected by Sir Thomas
Holte in 1618-1635, is an admirable architectural example of its period,
built of red brick. It stands in a large park, the whole property being
acquired by the corporation of Birmingham in 1864, when the mansion
became a museum and art gallery. It contains the panelling of a room
from the house of Edmund Hector, which formerly stood in Old Square,
Birmingham, where Dr Samuel Johnson was a frequent visitor. Aston Lower
Grounds, adjoining the park, contain an assembly hall, and the playing
field of the Aston Villa Football Club, where the more important games
are witnessed by many thousands of spectators. Aston Manor was
incorporated in 1903. The parliamentary borough returns one member. The
