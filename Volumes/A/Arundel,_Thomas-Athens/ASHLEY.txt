ASHLEY, WILLIAM JAMES (1860-   ), English economist, was born in London
on the 25th of February 1860. He was educated at St Olave's grammar
school and Balliol College, Oxford, and became a fellow of Lincoln
College. In 1888 he was appointed professor of political economy and
constitutional history in Toronto University, a post which he resigned
in 1892, in order to become professor of economic history at Harvard
University. In 1901 he was appointed professor of commerce and finance
in Birmingham University and in 1902 dean of the faculty of commerce.
Professor Ashley became well known for his work on the early history of
English industry, and for his prominence among those English economists
who supported Mr Chamberlain's tariff reform movement. His most
important works are _Early History of the English Woollen Industry_
(1887); _Introduction to English Economic History and Theory_ (2 parts,
1888-1893); _Surveys, Historic and Economic_ (1900); _Adjustment of
