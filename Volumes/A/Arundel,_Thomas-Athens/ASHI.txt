'ASHI (352-427), Jewish _'amora_, the first editor of the Talmud, was
born at Babylon. He was head of the Sura Academy, and there began the
Babylonian Talmud, spending thirty years of his life at it. He left the
work incomplete, and it was finished by his disciple Rabina just before
the year 500 A.D. (See TALMUD.)
