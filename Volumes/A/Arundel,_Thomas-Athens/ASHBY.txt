ASHBY, TURNER (1824-1862), American cavalry leader in the Confederate
army, was born in Fauquier county, Virginia, in 1824. Before the Civil
War he was a planter in Markham, Fauquier county, and a local
politician. When hostilities began he raised a regiment of cavalry,
which he led with conspicuous success in the Valley campaigns of
1861-62, under Joseph Johnston and Stonewall Jackson. He was promoted a
brigadier-general shortly before his death, which took place in a
cavalry skirmish at Harrisonburg, Va., on the 6th of June 1862. By his
early death the Confederates lost one of the best cavalry officers in
their service.
