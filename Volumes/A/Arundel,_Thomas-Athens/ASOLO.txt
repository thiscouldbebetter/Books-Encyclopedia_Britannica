ASOLO (anc. _Acelum_), a town of Venetia, Italy, in the province of
Treviso, about 19 m. N.W. direct from the town of Treviso, and some 10
m. E. of Bassanoby road. Pop. (1901) 5847. It is well situated on a
hill, 690 ft. above sea-level. Remains of Roman baths and of a theatre
have been discovered in the course of excavation (_Notizie degli scavi_,
1877, 235; 1881, 205; 1882, 289), and the town was probably a
_municipium_. It became an episcopal see in the 6th century. It was to
Asolo that Catherine Cornaro, queen of Cyprus, retired on her
abdication. Here she was visited by Pietro Bembo, who conceived here his
_Dialoghi degli Asolani_, and by Andrea Navagero (Naugerius). Paulus
Manutius was born here. The village of Maser is 4½ m. to the E., and
near it is the Villa Giacomelli, erected by Palladio, containing
frescoes by Paolo Veronese, executed in 1566-1568 for Marcantonio
Barbaro of Venice, and ranking among his best works.
