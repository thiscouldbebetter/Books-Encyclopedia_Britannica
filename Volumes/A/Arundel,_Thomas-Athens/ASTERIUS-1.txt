ASTERIUS, bishop of Amasia, in Pontus, c. 400. He was partly
contemporary with the emperor Julian (d. 363) and lived to a great age.
His fame rests chiefly on his _Homilies_, which were much esteemed in
the Eastern Church. Most of these have been lost, but twenty-one are
given in full by Migne (_Patrol. Ser. Gr._ xl. 164-477), and there are
fragments of others in Photius (_Cod._ 271). Asterius was a man of much
culture, and his works are a valuable contribution to our knowledge of
the history of preaching.
