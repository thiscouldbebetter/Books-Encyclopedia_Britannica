ASAPH, the eponym of the Asaphite gild of singers, one of the hereditary
choirs that superintended the musical services of the temple at
Jerusalem in post-exilic times. The names occur in the titles of certain
Psalms, and the writer of the Book of Chronicles makes Asaph a seer (2
Chron. xxix. 30), contemporary with David and Solomon, and chief of the
singers of his time.
