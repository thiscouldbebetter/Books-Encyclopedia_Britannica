ASTERIA, or STAR-STONE (from Gr. [Greek: astaer], star), a name applied
to such ornamental stones as exhibit when cut _en cabochon_ a luminous
star. The typical asteria is the star-sapphire, generally a bluish-grey
corundum, milky or opalescent, with a star of six rays. (See SAPPHIRE.)
In red corundum the stellate reflexion is less common, and hence the
star-ruby occasionally found with the star-sapphire in Ceylon is among
the most valued of "fancy stones." When the radiation is shown by yellow
corundum, the stone is called star-topaz. Cymophane, or chatoyant
chrysoberyl, may also be asteriated. In all these cases the asterism is
due to the reflexion of light from twin-lamellae or from fine tubular
cavities or thin enclosures definitely arranged in the stone. The
_astrion_ of Pliny is believed to have been our moonstone, since it is
described as a colourless stone from India having within it the
appearance of a star shining with the light of the moon. All star-stones
were formerly regarded with much superstition.
