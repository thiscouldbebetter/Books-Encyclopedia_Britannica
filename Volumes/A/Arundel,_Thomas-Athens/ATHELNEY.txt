ATHELNEY, a slight eminence of small extent in the low level tract about
the junction of the rivers Tone and Parrett in Somersetshire, England.
It was formerly isolated by marshes and accessible only by boat or
artificial causeway, and under these conditions it gained its historical
fame as the retreat of King Alfred in 878-879 when he was unable to
withstand the incursions of the Danes. After regaining his throne he
founded a monastery here in gratitude for the retreat afforded him by
the island; no traces of it exist above ground, but remains have been
excavated. There was also found here, in 1693, the celebrated Alfred
jewel, bearing his name, and preserved in the Ashmolean Museum at
Oxford. An inscribed pillar commemorating the king was set up in 1801.
The name of Athelney signifies the Isle of Princes (A.S.
_AEthelingaea_). Athelney is a railway station on a branch of the Great
Western line.
