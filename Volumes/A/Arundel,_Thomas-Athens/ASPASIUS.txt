ASPASIUS, a Greek peripatetic philosopher, and a prolific commentator on
Aristotle. He flourished probably towards the close of the 1st century
A.D., or perhaps during the reign of Antoninus Pius. His commentaries on
the _Categories, De Interpretatione, De Sensu_, and other works of
Aristotle are frequently referred to by later writers, but have not come
down to us. Commentaries on Plato, mentioned by Porphyry in his life of
Plotinus, have also been lost. Commentaries on books 1-4, 7 (in part),
and 8 of the _Nicomachean Ethics_ are preserved; that on book 8 was
printed with those of Eustratius and others by Aldus Manutius at Venice
in 1536. They were partly (2-4) translated into Latin by Felicianus in
1541, and have frequently been republished, but their authenticity has
been disputed. The most recent edition is by G. Heylbut in _Commentaria
in Aristotelem Graeca_, xix. 1 (Berlin, 1889).

Another ASPASIUS, in the 3rd century A.D., was a Roman sophist and
rhetorician, son or pupil of the rhetorician Demetrianus. He taught
rhetoric in Rome, and filled the chair of rhetoric founded by Vespasian.
He was secretary to the emperor Maximin. His orations, which are praised
for their style, are lost.
