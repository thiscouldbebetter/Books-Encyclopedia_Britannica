ATHALARIC (516-534), king of the Ostrogoths, grandson of Theodoric,
became king of the Ostrogoths in Italy on his grandfather's death (526).
As he was only ten years old, the regency was assumed by his mother
Amalasuntha (q.v.). The murmurs of the Gothic nobles procured for their
young sovereign too early emancipation from the schoolroom. He drank
heavily, and indulged in vicious excesses which ruined his constitution.
He died on the 2nd of October 534.
