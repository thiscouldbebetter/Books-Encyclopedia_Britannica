ASTELL, MARY (1668-1731), English author, was born at
Newcastle-upon-Tyne. She was instructed by her uncle, a clergyman, in
Latin and French, logic, mathematics and natural philosophy. In her
twentieth year she went to London, where she continued her studies. She
published, in 1697, a work entitled _A Serious Proposal to the Ladies,
wherein a Method is offered for the Improvement of their Minds_. With
the same end in view she elaborated a scheme for a ladies' college,
which was favourably entertained by Queen Anne, and would have been
carried out had not Bishop Burnet interfered. The most important of her
other works was _The Christian Religion, as professed by a Daughter of
the Church of England_, published in 1705.
