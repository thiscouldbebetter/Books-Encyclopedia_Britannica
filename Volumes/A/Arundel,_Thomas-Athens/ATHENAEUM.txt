ATHENAEUM, a name originally applied in ancient Greece ([Greek:
Athaenaion]) to buildings dedicated to Athena, and specially used as the
designation of a temple in Athens, where poets and men of learning were
accustomed to meet and read their productions. The academy for the
promotion of learning which the emperor Hadrian built (about A.D. 135)
at Rome, near the Forum, was also called the Athenaeum. Poets and
orators still met and discussed there, but regular courses of
instruction were given by a staff of professors in rhetoric,
jurisprudence, grammar and philosophy. The institution, later called
Schola Romana, continued in high repute till the 5th century. Similar
academies were also founded in the provinces and at Constantinople by
the emperor Theodosius II. In modern times the name has been applied to
various academies, as those of Lyons and Marseilles, and the Dutch high
schools; and it has become a very general designation for literary
clubs. It is also familiar as the title of several literary periodicals,
notably of the London literary weekly founded in 1828.
