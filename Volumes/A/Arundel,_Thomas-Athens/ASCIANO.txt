ASCIANO, a town of Tuscany, in the province of Siena, 19 m. S.E. of the
town of Siena by rail. Pop. (1901) 7618. It is surrounded by walls built
by the Sienese in 1351, and has some 14th-century churches with
paintings of the same period. Six miles to the south is the large
Benedictine monastery of Monte Oliveto Maggiore, founded in 1320, famous
for the frescoes by Luca Signorelli (1497-1498) and Antonio Bazzi,
called Sodoma (1505), in the cloister, illustrating scenes from the
legend of St Benedict; the latter master's work is perhaps nowhere
better represented than here. The church contains fine inlaid choir
stalls by Fra Giovanni da Verona. The buildings, which are mostly of red
brick, are conspicuous against the gray clayey and sandy soil. The
monastery is described by Aeneas Sylvius Piccolomini (Pope Pius II.) in
his _Commentaria_. Remains of Roman baths, with a fine mosaic pavement,
were found within the town in 1898 (G. Pellegrini in _Notizie degli
scavi_, 1899, 6).
