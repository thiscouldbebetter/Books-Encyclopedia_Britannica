ASMONEUS, or ASAMONAEUS (so Josephus), great-grandfather of Mattathias,
the father of Judas Maccabaeus. Nothing more is known of him, and the
name is only given by Josephus (not in 1 Macc. ii. 1). But the dynasty
was known to Josephus and the Mishna (once) as "the sons (race) of the
Asamonaeans (of A.)"; and the Targum of 1 Sam. ii. 4 has "the house of
the Hashmoneans who were weak, signs were wrought for them and
strength." If not the founder, Asmoneus was probably the home of the
family (cf. Heshmon, Jos. xv. 27).
