ASSOCIATE (Lat. _associatus_, from _ad_, to, and _sociare_ to join). one
who is united with another, and so generally a companion--in particular
a subordinate member of an institution or society, as an associate of
the Royal Academy, or one holding a degree in a learned society lower
than that of fellow. In English law the associates are officers of the
supreme court, whose duties are to draw up the list of causes, enter
verdicts, hand the records to the parties, &c., and generally to conduct
the business of trials. By the Judicature (Officers) Act 1879 they were
styled masters of the supreme court, but the office is now amalgamated
with the crown office department, of which they are clerks.
