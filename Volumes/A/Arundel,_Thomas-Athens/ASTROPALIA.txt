ASTROPALIA (classical _Astypalaea_), an island, with good harbours, in
the south part of the Aegean, situated in 36.5° N. and immediately west
of 26.5° E. It was colonized by Megara, and its constitution and
buildings are known from numerous inscriptions. The Roman emperors
recognized it as a free state, and in the middle ages it was called
_Stampalia_, and belonged to the noble Venetian family of Quirini. It
was taken by the Turks in the 16th century, and is now noted for its
sponges. The customs and dress of the people, who speak a patois of
romaic origin, are interesting.
