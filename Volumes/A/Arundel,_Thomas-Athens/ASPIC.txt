ASPIC (French, from Lat. _aspis_), an asp or viper found in Egypt whose
bite is supposed to cause a swift and easy death, hence poetically a
term for any venomous snake. From association, perhaps, with the
coldness of the aspic (as in the French proverb, _froid comme un
aspic_), the word is used for a savoury jelly containing meat, fish or
eggs, &c. It is also the botanical name of the _Lavandula spica_, or
spikenard, from which a white, aromatic and highly inflammable oil is
distilled, called _huile d'aspic_.
