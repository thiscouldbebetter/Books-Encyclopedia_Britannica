ASSAYE, a village of Hyderabad or the Nizam's Dominions, in southern
India, just beyond the Berar frontier. The place is celebrated as the
site of a battle fought on the 23rd of September 1803 between the
combined Mahratta forces Under Sindhia and the rajah of Berar and the
British under Major-General Wellesley, afterwards the duke of
Wellington. The Mahratta force consisted of 50,000 men, supported by 100
pieces of cannon served by French artillerymen, and entrenched in a
strong position. Against this the English had but a force of 4500 men,
which, however, after a severe struggle, gained the most complete
victory that ever crowned British valour in India. Of the enemy 12,000
were killed and wounded; and General Wellesley lost 1657--one-third of
his little force--killed and wounded. Assaye is 261 m. north-west of
Hyderabad.
