ASHBURTON, a river of Western Australia, rising in the mountains west of
the Great Sandy Desert, and following a course north-westward for 400
m., into Exmouth Gulf. In its upper reaches it flows through a rich
gold-bearing district to which it gives name, and nearer its mouth it
traverses a vast tract of fine pastoral country. The outlet for both
these districts is the port of Onslow, at the mouth of the river, near
which there are several pearl-fishing stations. The river is not
navigable.
