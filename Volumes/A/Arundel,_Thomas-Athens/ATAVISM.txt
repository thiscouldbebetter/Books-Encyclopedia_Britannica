ATAVISM (from Lat. _atavus_, a great-great-great-grandfather or
ancestor), the term given in biology to the reproduction in a living
person or animal of the characteristics of an ancestor more remote than
its parents (see HEREDITY). Loosely used, it connotes a reversion to an
earlier type. Individuals reproduce unexpectedly the traits of earlier
ancestors, and ethnologists and criminologists frequently explain by
"atavism" the occurrence of degenerate species of man; but the whole
subject is complicated by other possible explanations of such phenomena,
included in the scientific study of normal "variation."
