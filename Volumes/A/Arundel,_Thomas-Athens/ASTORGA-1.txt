ASTORGA, a city of N.W. Spain, in the province of Leon; situated near
the right bank of the river Tuerto, and at the junction of the
Salamanca-Corunna and Leon-Astorga railways. Pop. (1900) 5573. Astorga
was the Roman Asturica Augusta, a provincial capital, and the
meeting-place of four military roads. Though sacked by the Goths in the
5th century, and later by the Moors, it is still surrounded by massive
walls of Roman origin. A ruined castle, near the city, recalls its
strategic importance in the 8th century, when Asturias, Galicia and Leon
were the headquarters of resistance to the Moors. Astorga has been the
see of a bishop since the 3rd century, and was formerly known as the
City of Priests, from the number of ecclesiastics resident within its
walls. Its Gothic cathedral dates from the 15th century. The city
confers the title of marquis on the Osorio family, the ruins of whose
palace, sacked in 1810 by the French, are still an object of interest.
