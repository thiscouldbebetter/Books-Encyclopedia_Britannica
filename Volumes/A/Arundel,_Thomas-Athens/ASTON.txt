ASTON, ANTHONY (fl. 1712-1731), English actor and dramatist, began to be
known on the London stage in the early years of the 18th century. He had
tried the law and other professions, which he finally abandoned for the
theatre. He had some success as a dramatic author, writing _Love in a
Hurry_, performed in Dublin about 1709, and _Pastora, or the Coy
Shepherdess_, an opera (1712). For many years he toured the English
provinces with his wife and son, producing pieces which he himself
wrote, or medleys from various plays fitted together with songs and
dialogues of his own.
