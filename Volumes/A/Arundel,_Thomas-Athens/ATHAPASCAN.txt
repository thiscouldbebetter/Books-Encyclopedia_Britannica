ATHAPASCAN, a widely distributed linguistic stock of North American
Indians, the chief tribes included being the Chippewyan, Navajo, Apache,
Jicarilla, Lipan, Hupa and Wailaki. The Athapascan family is
geographically divided into Northern, Pacific and Southern. The Northern
division (Tinneh or Déné) is about Alaska, and the Yukon and Mackenzie
rivers,--the eponymous "Athabasca" tribe living round Lake Athabasca, in
the province of Alberta in Canada. The Pacific division covers a strip
of territory, some 400 m. in length, from Oregon southwards into
California. The Southern division includes Arizona and New Mexico, parts
of Utah, Colorado, Kansas and Texas, and the northern part of Mexico.
The typical tribes are those of the Northern division.
