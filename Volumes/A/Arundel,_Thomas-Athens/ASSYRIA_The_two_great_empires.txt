ASSYRIA. The two great empires, Assyria and Babylon, which grew up on
the banks of the Tigris and Euphrates, can be separated as little
historically as geographically. From the beginning their history is
closely intertwined; and the power of the one is a measure of the
weakness of the other. This interdependence of Assyrian and Babylonian
history was recognized by ancient writers, and has been confirmed by
modern discovery. But whereas Assyria takes the first place in the
classical accounts to the exclusion of Babylonia, the decipherment of
the inscriptions has proved that the converse was really the case, and
that, with the exception of some seven or eight centuries, Assyria might
be described as a province or dependency of Babylon. Not only was
Babylonia the mother country, as the tenth chapter of Genesis explicitly
states, but the religion and culture, the literature and the characters
in which it was contained, the arts and the sciences of the Assyrians
were derived from their southern neighbours. They were similar in race
and language. (See BABYLONIA AND ASSYRIA.)
