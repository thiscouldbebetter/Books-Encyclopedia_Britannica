ASCLEPIADES, Greek physician, was born at Prusa in Bithynia in 124 B.C.,
and flourished at Rome in the end of the 2nd century B.C. He travelled
much when young, and seems at first to have settled at Rome as a
rhetorician. In that profession he did not succeed, but he acquired
great reputation as a physician. He founded his medical practice on a
modification of the atomic or corpuscular theory, according to which
disease results from an irregular or inharmonious motion of the
corpuscles of the body. His remedies were, therefore, directed to the
restoration of harmony, and he trusted much to changes of diet,
accompanied by friction, bathing and exercise, though he also employed
emetics and bleeding. He recommended the use of wine, and in every way
strove to render himself as agreeable as possible to his patients. His
pupils were very numerous, and the school formed by them was called the
Methodical. Asclepiades died at an advanced age.
