ATE, in Greek mythology, the personification of criminal folly, the
daughter of Zeus and Eris (Strife). She misled even Zeus to take a hasty
oath, whereby Heracles became subject to Eurystheus. Zeus thereupon cast
her by the hair out of Olympus, whither she did not return, but remained
on earth, working evil and mischief (_Iliad_, xix. 91). She is followed
by the Litae (Prayers), the old and crippled daughters of Zeus, who are
able to repair the evil done by her (_Iliad_, ix. 502). In later times
Ate is regarded as the avenger of sin (Sophocles, _Antigone_, 614, 625).
