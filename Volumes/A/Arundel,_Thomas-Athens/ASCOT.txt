ASCOT, a village in the Wokingham parliamentary division of Berkshire,
England, famous for its race-meetings. Pop. of parish of Ascot Heath
(1901), 1927. The station on the Southwestern railway, 29 m. W.S.W. of
London, is called Ascot and Sunninghill; the second name belonging to an
adjacent township with a population (civil parish) of 4719. The
race-course is on Ascot Heath, and was laid out by order of Queen Anne
in 1711, and on the 11th of August in that year the first meeting was
held and attended by the queen. The course is almost exactly 2 m. in
circumference, and the meetings are held in June. The principal race is
that for the Ascot Gold Cup, instituted in 1807. The meeting is one of
the most fashionable in England, and is commonly attended by members of
the royal family. The royal procession, for which the meeting is
peculiarly famous, was initiated by George IV. in 1820.
