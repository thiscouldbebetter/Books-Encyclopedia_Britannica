ARVALS, ARVELS or ARTHELS (O. Norse _Arfr_, inheritance, and _öl_, A.S.
Ale, a banquet), primarily the funeral dinner, and later, especially in
the north of England, a thin, light, sweet cake, spiced with cinnamon
and nutmeg, served to the poor at such feasts. The funeral meal was
called the Arvel-dinner. The custom seems to have been to hold on such
occasions an informal inquest, when the corpse was publicly exposed, to
exculpate the heir and those entitled to the property of the dead from
all accusations of foul play.
