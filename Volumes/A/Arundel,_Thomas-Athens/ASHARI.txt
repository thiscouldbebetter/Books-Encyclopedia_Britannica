ASH'ARI [Abu-l Hasan 'Ali ibn Isma'il ul-Ash'ari], (873-935), Arabian
theologian, was born of pure Arab stock at Basra, but spent the greater
part of his life at Bagdad. Although belonging to an orthodox family, he
became a pupil of the great Mu'tazalite teacher al-Jubba'i, and himself
remained a Mu'tazalite until his fortieth year. In 912 he returned to
the faith of his fathers and became its most distinguished champion,
using the philosophical methods he had learned in the school of heresy.
His theology, which occupied a mediate position between the extreme
views on most points, became dominant among the Shafi'ites. He is said
to have written over a hundred works, of which only four or five are
known to be extant.
