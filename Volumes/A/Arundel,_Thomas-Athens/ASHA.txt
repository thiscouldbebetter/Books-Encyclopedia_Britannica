A'SHA [MAIMUN IBN QAIS], Arabian poet, was born before Mahomet, and
lived long enough to accept the mission of the prophet. He was born in
Manfuha, a village of al-Yemama in the centre of Arabia, and became a
wandering singer, passing through all Arabia from Hadramut in the south
to al-Hira in the north, and naturally frequenting the annual fair at
Okaz (Ukaz). His love poems are devoted to the praise of Huraira, a
black female slave. Even before the time of Mahomet he is said to have
believed in the resurrection and last judgment, and to have been a
monotheist. These beliefs may have been due to his intercourse with the
bishop of Nejran (Najran) and the `Ibadites (Christians) of al-Hira. His
poems were praised for their descriptions of the wild ass, for the
praise of wine, for their skill in praise and satire, and for the
varieties of metre employed. His best-known poem is that in praise of
Mahomet.

  His poems have been collected from various sources in L. Cheikho's
  _Les Poètes arabes chrétiens_ (Jesuit press, Beirut, 1890), pp.
  357-399. His eulogy of Mahomet has been edited by H. Thorbecke, _Al
  Asa's Lobgedicht auf Muhammad_ (Leipzig, 1875).     (G. W. T.)
