ASCLEPIADES, of Samos, epigrammatist and lyric poet, friend of
Theocritus, flourished about 270 B.C. He was the earliest and most
important of the convivial and erotic epigrammatists. Only a few of his
compositions are actual "inscriptions"; others sing the praises of the
poets whom he specially admired, but the majority of them are
love-songs. It is doubtful whether he is the author of all the epigrams
(some 40 in number) which bear his name in the Greek Anthology. He
possibly gave his name to the Asclepiadean metre.
