ASOR (Hebr. for "ten"), an instrument "of ten strings" mentioned in the
Bible, about which authors are not agreed. The word occurs only three
times in the Bible, and has not been traced elsewhere. In Psalm xxxiii.
2 the reference is to "kinnor, nebel and asor"; in Psalm xcii. 3, to
"nebel and asor"; in Psalm cxliv. to "nebel-asor." In the English
version _asor_ is translated "an instrument of ten strings," with a
marginal note "omit" applied to "instrument." In the Septuagint, the
word being derived from a root signifying "ten," the Greek is [Greek: en
dekachordo] or [Greek: psaltaerion dekachordon], in the Vulgate _in
decachordo psalterio_. Each time the word _asor_ is used it follows the
word _nebel_ (see PSALTERY), and probably merely indicates a variant of
the nebel, having ten strings instead of the customary twelve assigned
to it by Josephus (_Antiquities_, vii. 12. 3).
