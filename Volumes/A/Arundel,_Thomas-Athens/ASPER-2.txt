ASPER, HANS (1499-1571), Swiss painter, was born and died at Zürich. He
wrought in a great variety of styles, but excelled chiefly in flower and
fruit pieces, and in portrait-painting. Many of his pictures have
perished, but his style may be judged from the illustrations to
Gessner's _Historia Animalium_, for which he is said to have furnished
the designs, and from portraits of Zwingli and his daughter Regula
Gwalter, which are preserved in the public library of Zürich. It has
been usual to class Asper among the pupils and imitators of Holbein, but
an inspection of his works is sufficient to show that this is a mistake.
Though Asper was held in high reputation by his fellow-citizens, who
elected him a member of the Great Council, and had a medal struck in his
honour, he seems to have died in poverty.
