ATHALIAH, in the Bible, the daughter of Ahab, and wife of Jehoram, king
of Judah. After the death of Ahaziah, her son she usurped the throne and
reigned for six years. She is said to have massacred all the members of
the royal house of Judah (2 Kings xi. 1-3), but a similar atrocity is
also ascribed to Jehu (2 Kings x. 12-14); with both notices contrast 2
Chron. xxi. 17. The sole survivor Joash was concealed in the temple by
his aunt, Jehosheba, wife of the priest Jehoida (2 Chron. xxii. 11)
These organized a revolution in favour of Joash, and caused Athaliah and
her adherents to be put to death (2 Kings xi.; 2 Chron. xxii. 10-12,
xxiii., xxiv. 7).

The story of Athaliah forms the subject of one of Racine's best
tragedies. It has been musically treated by Handel and Mendelssohn.
