ASTLEY, SIR JOHN DUGDALE, Bart. (1828-1894), English soldier and
sportsman, was a descendant of Lord Astley, and son of the 2nd baronet
(cr. 1821). From 1848 to 1859 he was in the army, serving in the Crimean
War and retiring as lieutenant-colonel. He married an heiress in 1858,
and thenceforth devoted himself to horse-racing, pugilism and sport in
general. He succeeded to the baronetcy in 1873, and from 1874 to 1880
was Conservative M.P. for North Lincolnshire. He was a popular figure on
the turf, being familiarly known as "the Mate," and won and lost large
sums of money. Just before his death, on the 10th of October 1894, he
published some entertaining reminiscences, under the title of _Fifty
Years of my Life_.
