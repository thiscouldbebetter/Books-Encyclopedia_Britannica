ASTERIUS, of Cappadocia, sophist and teacher of rhetoric in Galatia, was
converted to Christianity about the year 300, and became the disciple of
Lucian, the founder of the school of Antioch. During the persecution
under Maximian (304) he relapsed into paganism, and thus, though
received again into the church by Lucian and supported by the Eusebian
party, never attained to ecclesiastical office. He is best known as an
able defender of the semi-Arian position, and was styled by Athanasius
the "advocate" of the Arians. His chief work was the _Syntagmation_, but
he wrote many others, including commentaries on the Gospels, the Psalms,
and Romans. He attended many synods, and we last hear of him at the
synod of Antioch in 341.
