ASAF-UD-DOWLAH, nawab wazir of Oudh from 1775 to 1797, was the son of
Shuja-ud-Dowlah, his mother and grandmother being the begums of Oudh,
whose spoliation formed one of the chief counts in the charges against
Warren Hastings. When Shuja-ud-Dowlah died he left two million pounds
sterling buried in the vaults of the zenana. The widow and mother of the
deceased prince claimed the whole of this treasure under the terms of a
will which was never produced. When Warren Hastings pressed the nawab
for the payment of debt due to the Company, he obtained from his mother
a loan of 26 lakhs of rupees, for which he gave her a _jagir_ of four
times the value; he subsequently obtained 30 lakhs more in return for a
full acquittal, and the recognition of her _jagirs_ without interference
for life by the Company. These _jagirs_ were afterwards confiscated on
the ground of the begum's complicity in the rising of Chai Singh, which
was attested by documentary evidence. The evidence now available seems
to show that Warren Hastings did his best throughout to rescue the nawab
from his own incapacity, and was inclined to be lenient to the begums.
