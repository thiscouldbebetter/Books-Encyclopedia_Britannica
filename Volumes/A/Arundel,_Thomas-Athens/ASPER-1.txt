ASPER, AEMILIUS, Latin grammarian, possibly lived in the 2nd century
A.D. He wrote commentaries on Terence, Sallust and Virgil. Numerous
fragments of the last show that as both critic and commentator he
possessed good judgment and taste. They are printed in Keil, _Probi in
Vergilii Bucolica Commentarius_ (1848); see also Suringar, _Historia
Critica Scholiastarum Latinorum_ (1834); Gräfenhan, _Geschichte der
klassischen Philologie im Alterthum._ iv. (1843-1850). Two short
grammatical treatises, extant under the name of Asper, and of very
little value, have nothing to do with the commentator, but belong to a
much later date--the time of Priscian (6th century). Both are printed in
Keil, _Grammatici Latini_. See also Schanz, _Geschichte der römischen
Litteratur_, § 598.
