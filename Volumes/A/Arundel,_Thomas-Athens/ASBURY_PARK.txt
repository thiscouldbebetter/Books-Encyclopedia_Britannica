winter months. There is an excellent beach, along which extends a
board-walk about 1 m. long; the beach is owned and controlled by the

being obtained from artesian wells. Asbury Park was founded in 1869, was
named in honour of the Rev. Francis Asbury, was incorporated as a
borough in 1874, and was chartered as a city in 1897. In 1906 territory
to the west with a population estimated at 6000 was annexed.
