ASPERGES ("thou wilt sprinkle," from the Latin verb _aspergere_), the
ceremony of sprinkling the people with holy water before High Mass in
the Roman Catholic Church, so called from the first word of the verse
(Ps. iv. 9) _Asperges me, Domini, hyssopo et mundabor_, with which the
priest begins the ceremony. The brush used for sprinkling is an
aspergill (_aspergillum_), or aspersoir, and the vessel for this water
an _aspersorium_. The act of sprinkling the water is called _aspersion_.
