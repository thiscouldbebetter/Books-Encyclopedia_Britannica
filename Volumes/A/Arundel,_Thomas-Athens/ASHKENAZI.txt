'ASHKENAZI, SEBI (1656-1718), known as Hakham Sebi, for some time rabbi
of Amsterdam, was a resolute opponent of the followers of the
pseudo-Messiah, Sabbatai Sebi (q.v.). He had a chequered career, owing
to his independence of character. He visited many lands, including
England, where he wielded much influence. His _Responsa_, are held in
high esteem.
