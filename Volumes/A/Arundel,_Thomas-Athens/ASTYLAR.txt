ASTYLAR (from Gr. á-, privative, and [Greek: stylos], a column), an
architectural term given to a class of design in which neither columns
nor pilasters are used for decorative purposes; thus the Ricardi and
Strozzi palaces in Florence are astylar in their design, in
contradistinction to Palladio's palaces at Vicenza, which are columnar.
