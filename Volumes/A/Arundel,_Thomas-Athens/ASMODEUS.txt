ASMODEUS, or ASHMEDAI, an evil demon who appears in later Jewish
tradition as "king of demons." He is sometimes identified with Beelzebub
or Apollyon (Rev. ix. 11). In the Talmud he plays a great part in the
legends concerning Solomon. In the apocryphal book of Tobit (iii. 8)
occurs the well-known story of his love for Sara, the beautiful daughter
of Raguel, whose seven husbands were slain in succession by him on their
respective bridal nights. At last Tobias, by burning the heart and liver
of a fish, drove off the demon, who fled to Egypt. From the part played
by Asmodeus in this story, he has been often familiarly called the
genius of matrimonial unhappiness or jealousy, and as such may be
compared with Lilith. Le Sage makes him the principal character in his
novel _Le Diable boiteux_. Both the word and the conception seem to have
been derived originally from the Persian. The name has been taken to
mean "covetous." It is in any case no doubt identical with the demon
Aeshma of the Zend-Avesta and the Pahlavi texts. But the meaning is not
certain. It is generally agreed that the second part of the name
Asmodeus is the same as the Zend _daewa, dew_, "demon." The first part
may be equivalent to Aeshma, the impersonation of anger. But W.
Baudissin (Herzog-Hauck, _Realencyklopädie_) prefers to derive it from
_ish_, to drive, set in motion; whence _ish-min_, driving, impetuous.

  The legend of Asmodeus is given fully in the _Jewish Encyclopaedia_,
  s.v. See also the articles in the _Encyclopaedia Biblica_, Hastings'
  _Dictionary of the Bible_, and Herzog-Hauck, _Realencyklopädie_.
