ASHWELL, LENA (1872-   ), English actress, was the daughter of Commander
Pocock, R.N. In 1896 she married the actor Arthur Playfair, whom she
divorced in 1908; later in the latter year she married Dr Simson. In
1895 she played Elaine in Sir Henry Irving's production of _King Arthur_
at the Lyceum, and again acted with him in 1903 in _Dante_. She made her
first striking success, however, on the London stage in _Mrs Dane's
Defence_ with Sir Charles Wyndham in 1900, and a few years later her
acting in _Leah Kleschna_ confirmed her position as one of the leading
actresses in London. In 1907 she started under her own management at the
Kingsway theatre.
