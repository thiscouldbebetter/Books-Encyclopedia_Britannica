ASISIUM (mod. _Assisi_), an ancient town of Umbria, in a lofty situation
about 15 m. E.S.E. of Perusia. As an independent community it had
already begun to use Latin as well as Umbrian in its inscriptions (for
one of these recording the chief magistrates--_marones_--see _C.I.L._
xi. 5390). It became a _municipium_ in 90 B.C., but, though numerous
inscriptions (_C.I.L._ xi. 5371-5606) testify to its importance in the
Imperial period, it is hardly mentioned by our classical authorities.
Scanty traces of the ancient city walls may be seen; within the town the
best-preserved building is the so-called temple of Minerva, with six
Corinthian columns of travertine, now converted into a church, erected
by Gaius and Titus Caesius in the Augustan era. It fronted on to the
ancient forum, part of the pavement of which, with a base for the
equestrian statues of Castor and Pollux (as the inscription upon it
records) has been laid bare beneath the present Piazza Vittorio
Emanuele. The remains of the amphitheatre, in _opus reticulatum_, may be
seen in the north-east corner of the town; and other ancient buildings
have been discovered. Asisium was probably the birthplace of Propertius.
