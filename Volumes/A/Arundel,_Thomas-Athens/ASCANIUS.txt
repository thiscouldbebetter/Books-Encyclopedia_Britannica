ASCANIUS, in Roman legend, the son of Aeneas by Creüsa or Lavinia. From
Livy it would appear that tradition recognized two sons of Aeneas called
by this name, the one the son of his Trojan, the other of his Latin
wife. According to the usual account, he accompanied his father to Italy
on his flight from Troy. On the death of Aeneas, the government of
Latium was left in the hands of Lavinia, Ascanius being too young to
undertake it. After thirty years he left Lavinium, and founded Alba
Longa. Ascanius was also called Ilus and Iulus, and the Julian gens
claimed to be descended from him. Several more or less contradictory
traditions may be found in Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Strabo and other
writers.
