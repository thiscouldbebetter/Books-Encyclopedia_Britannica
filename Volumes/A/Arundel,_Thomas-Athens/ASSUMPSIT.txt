ASSUMPSIT ("he has undertaken," from Lat. _assumere_), a word applied to
an action for the recovery of damages by reason of the breach or
non-performance of a simple contract, either express or implied, and
whether made orally or in writing. _Assumpsit_ was the word always used
in pleadings by the plaintiff to set forth the defendant's undertaking
or promise, hence the name of the action. Claims in actions of
_assumpsit_ were ordinarily divided into (a) common or _indebitatus
assumpsit_, brought usually on an implied promise, and (b) special
_assumpsit_, founded on an express promise. _Assumpsit_ as a form of
action became obsolete after the passing of the Judicature Acts 1873 and
1875. (See further CONTRACT; PLEADING and TORT.)
