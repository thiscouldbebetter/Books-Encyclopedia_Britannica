ASHRAF (SHUREFA, SHERIFS), a small scattered tribe of African "Arabs"
settled near Tokar, in the valleys of the Gash and Baraka, and in the
Amarar country north of Suakin. They call themselves Beni Hashin, and
claim descent from Mahomet; hence their name, _sherif_ (plural _ashraf_)
being the title applied to descendants of the prophet. In the time of
the khalifa Abdulla (1885-1898), Ashraf was the name by which the family
and adherents of his late master the mahdi were known, the mahdi's
family claiming to be Ashraf. The Ashraf of Tokar remained loyal to
Egypt during the Sudan troubles.
