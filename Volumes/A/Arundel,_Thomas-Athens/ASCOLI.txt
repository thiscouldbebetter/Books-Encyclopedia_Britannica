ASCOLI, GRAZIADIO ISAIA (1820-1907), Italian philologist; of Jewish
family, was born at Görz at an early age showed a marked linguistic
talent. In 1854 he published his _Studii orientali e linguistici_, and
in 1860 was appointed professor of philology at Milan. He made various
learned contributions to the study of Indo-European and Semitic
languages, and also of the gipsy language, but his special field was the
Italian dialects. He founded the _Archivio glottologico italiano_ in
1873, publishing in it his _Saggi Ladini_, and making it in succeeding
years the great organ of original scholarship on this subject. He was
universally recognized as the greatest authority on Italian linguistics,
and his article in the _Encyclopaedia Britannica_ (9th ed., revised for
this edition) became the classic exposition in English. (See ITALY:
_Language_.)
