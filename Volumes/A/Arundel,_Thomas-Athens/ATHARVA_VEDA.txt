ATHARVA VEDA, the fourth book of the Vedas, the ancient scriptures of
the Brahman religion. Like the other Vedas it is divided into Samhita,
Brahmanas and Upanishads, representing the spiritual element and its
magical and nationalistic development. The mantras or sayings composing
the Samhita of the Atharva Veda differ from those of the other Vedas by
being in the form of spells rather than prayers or hymns, and seem to
indicate a stage of religion lower than that of the Rig Veda.
