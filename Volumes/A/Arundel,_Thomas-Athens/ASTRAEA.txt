ASTRAEA, in Greek legend, the "star maiden," daughter of Zeus and
Themis, or of Astraeus the Titan and Eos, in which case she is
identified with Dike. During the golden age she remained among men
distributing blessings, but when the iron (or bronze) age came on, she
was forced to withdraw, being the last of the goddesses to quit the
earth. In the heavens she is amongst the signs of the zodiac as the
constellation Virgo. She is usually represented with a pair of scales
and a crown of stars.
