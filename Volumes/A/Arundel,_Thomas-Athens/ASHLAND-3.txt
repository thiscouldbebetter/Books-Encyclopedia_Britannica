ASHLAND, a village of Hanover county, Virginia, U.S.A., 17 m. N.W. of
Richmond. Pop. (1900) 1147; (1910) 1324. It is served by the Richmond,
Fredericksburg & Potomac railway, and is a favourite resort from
Richmond. Here is situated the Randolph-Macon College (Methodist
Episcopal, South), one of the oldest Methodist Episcopal colleges in the
United States. In 1832, two years after receiving its charter, it opened
near Boydton, Mecklenburg county, Virginia, and in 1868 was removed to
Ashland. The college in 1907-1908 had 150 students and a faculty of 16;
it publishes an endowed historical series called _The John P. Branch
Historical Papers of Randolph-Macon College_; and it is a part of the
"Randolph-Macon System of Colleges and Academies," which includes,
besides, Randolph-Macon Academy (1890) at Bedford City, Virginia, and
Randolph-Macon Academy (1892) at Front Royal, Virginia, both for boys;
Randolph-Macon Woman's College (1893) at Lynchburg, Virginia, which in
1907-1908 had an enrolment of 390; and Randolph-Macon Institute, for
girls, Danville, Virginia, which was admitted into the "System" in 1897.
These five institutions are under the control of a single board of
trustees; the work of the preparatory schools is thus correlated with
that of the colleges. About 7 m. out of Ashland is the birthplace of
Henry Clay, and about 15 m. distant is the birthplace of Patrick Henry.
Ashland was settled in 1845 and was incorporated in 1856.
