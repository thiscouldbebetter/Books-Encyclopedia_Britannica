ASKAULES (Gr. [Greek: askaulaes] [?] from [Greek: askos], bag, [Greek:
aulos], pipe), probably the Greek word for bag-piper, although there is
no documentary authority for its use. Neither it nor [Greek: askaulos]
(which would naturally mean the bag-pipe) has been found in Greek
classical authors, though J.J. Reiske--in a note on Dio Chrysostom,
_Orat._ lxxi. _ad fin._, where an unmistakable description of the
bag-pipe occurs ("and they say that he is skilled to write, to work as
an artist, and to play the pipe with his mouth, on the bag placed under
his arm-pits")--says that [Greek: askaulaes] was the Greek word for
bag-piper. The only actual corroboration of this is the use of
_ascaules_ for the pure Latin _utricularius_ in Martial x. 3. 8. Dio
Chrysostom flourished about A.D. 100; it is therefore only an assumption
that the bag-pipe was known to the classical Greeks by the name of
[Greek: askaulos]. It need not, however, be a matter of surprise that
among the highly cultured Greeks such an instrument as the bag-pipe
should exist without finding a place in literature. It is significant
that it is not mentioned by Pollux (_Onomast._ iv. 74) and Athenaeus
(_Deipnos._ iv. 76) in their lists of the various kinds of pipes.
