ASYLUM, RIGHT OF (Fr. _droit d'asile_; Ger. _Asylrecht_), in
international law, the right which a state possesses, by virtue of the
principle that every independent state is sole master within its
boundaries, of allowing fugitives from another country to enter or
sojourn upon its territory. Extradition (q.v.) treaties are undertakings
between states curtailing the exercise of the right of asylum in respect
of refugees from justice, but the conditions therein laid down
invariably show that nations regard the maintenance of this right of
asylum as intimately connected with their right of independent action,
however weak as states they may be, on their own soil. The neutral right
to grant asylum to belligerent forces is now governed by articles 57, 58
and 59 of the regulations annexed to the Hague Convention of the 29th
of July 1899, relating to the Laws and Customs of War on Land. (See
