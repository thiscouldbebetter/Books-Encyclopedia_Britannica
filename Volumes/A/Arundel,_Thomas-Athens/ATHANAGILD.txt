ATHANAGILD (d. 547) became king of the Visigoths (in Spain) in 534,
having invoked the aid of the emperor Justinian for his revolt against
his predecessor Agila. Athanagild, when himself king, vainly tried to
oust his late allies from the footing which they had gained in Spain,
nor were the Greeks finally expelled from Spain till seventy years
later. Athanagild himself is chiefly remembered for the tragic fortunes
of his daughters Brunechildis and Gavleswintha, who married two Frankish
brother kings, Sigebert and Chilperic. Athanagild died ("peacefully," as
the annalist remarks) in 547.
