ATHENRY, a market town of county Galway, Ireland, 14 m. inland (E.) from
Galway on the Midland Great Western main line. Pop. (1901) 853. Its name
is derived from _Ath-na-riogh_, the ford of kings; and it grew to
importance after the Anglo-Norman invasion as the first town of the
Burgs and Berminghams. The walls were erected in 1211 and the castle in
1238, and the remains of both are noteworthy. A Dominican monastery was
founded with great magnificence by Myler de Bermingham in 1241, and was
repaired by the Board of Works in 1893. Of the Franciscan monastery of
1464 little is left. The town returned two members to the Irish
parliament from the time of Richard II. to the Union; but it never
recovered from the wars of the Tudor period, culminating in a successful
siege by Red Hugh O'Donnell in 1596.
