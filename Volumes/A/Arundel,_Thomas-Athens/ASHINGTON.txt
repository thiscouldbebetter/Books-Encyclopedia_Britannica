ASHINGTON, an urban district in the Wansbeck parliamentary division of
Northumberland, England, 4 m. E. of Morpeth, on the Newbiggin branch of
the North Eastern railway. Pop. (1901) 13,956. The district, especially
along the river Wansbeck, is not without beauty, but there are numerous
collieries, from the existence of which springs the modern growth of
Ashington. At Bothal on the river (from which parish that of Ashington
was formed) is the castle originally belonging to the Bertram family, of
which Roger Bertram probably built the gatehouse, the only habitable
portion remaining, in the reign of Edward III. The ruins of the castle
are fragmentary, but of considerable extent. The church of St Andrew
here has interesting details from Early English to Perpendicular date,
and in the neighbouring woods is a ruined chapel of St Mary. The mining
centre of Ashington lies 2 m. north-east, on the high ground north of
the Wansbeck.
