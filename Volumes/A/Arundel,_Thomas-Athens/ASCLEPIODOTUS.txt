ASCLEPIODOTUS, Greek military writer, flourished in the 1st century B.C.
Nothing is known of him except that he was a pupil of Poseidonius the
Stoic (d. 51 B.C.). He is the supposed author of a treatise on
Graeco-Macedonian tactics ([Greek: Taktiká Kephálaia]), which, however,
is probably not his own work, but the skeleton outline of the lectures
delivered by his master, who is known to have written a work on the
subject.
