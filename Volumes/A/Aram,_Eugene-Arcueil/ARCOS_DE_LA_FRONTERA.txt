ARCOS DE LA FRONTERA, a town of southern Spain, in the province of
Cadiz; on the right bank of the river Guadalete, which flows past Santa
Maria into the Bay of Cadiz. Pop. (1900) 13,926. The town occupies a
ridge of sandstone, washed on three sides by the river, and commanding
fine views of the lofty peak of San Cristobál, on the east, and the
fertile Guadalete valley, celebrated in ancient Spanish ballads for its
horses. At the highest point of the ridge is a Gothic church with a fine
gateway, and a modern tower overlooking the town. The fame of its ten
bells dates from the wars between Spaniards and Moors in which "Arcos of
the Frontier" received its name. After its capture by Alphonso the Wise
of Castile (1252-1284), the town was a Christian stronghold on the
borders of Moorish territory. Another church contains several Moorish
banners, taken in 1483 at the battle of Záhara, a neighbouring village.
The ruined citadel, the theatre, and the palace of the dukes of Arcos
are the only other noteworthy buildings. Roman remains have been found
in the vicinity, and the ridge of Arcos is honeycombed with rock-hewn
chambers, said to be ancient cave-dwellings.
