ARBE (Serbo-Croatian _Rab_), an island in the Adriatic Sea, forming the
northernmost point of Dalmatia, Austria. Pop. (1900) 4441. Arbe is 13 m.
long; its greatest breadth is 5 m. The capital, which bears the same
name, is a walled town, remarkable, even among the Dalmatian cities, for
its beauty. It occupies a steep ridge jutting out from the west coast.
At the seaward end of this promontory is the 13th-century cathedral;
behind which the belfries of four churches, at least as ancient, rise in
a row along the crest of the ridge; while behind these, again, are the
castle and a background of desolate hills. Many of the houses are
roofless and untenanted; for, after five centuries of prosperity under
Venetian or Hungarian rule, an outbreak of plague in 1456 swept away the
majority of the townsfolk, and ruined the survivors. Some of the old
palaces are, nevertheless, of considerable interest; one especially as
the birthplace of the celebrated philosopher, Marc Antonio de Dominis.
Fishing and agriculture constitute the chief resources of the islanders,
whose ancient silk industry is still maintained. In 1018 the yearly
tribute due to Venice was fixed at ten pounds of silk or five pounds of
gold.
