ARCHIPELAGO, a name now applied to any island-studded sea, but
originally the distinctive designation of what is now generally known as
the Aegean Sea ([Greek: Aigaion pelagos]), its ancient name having been
revived. Several etymologies have been proposed: e.g. (1) it is a
corruption of the ancient name, _Egeopelago_; (2) it is from the modern
Greek, [Greek: Hagio pelago], the Holy Sea; (3) it arose at the time of
the Latin empire, and means the Sea of the Kingdom (_Archi_); (4) it is
a translation of the Turkish name, Ak Denghiz, _Argon Pelagos_, the
White Sea; (5) it is simply _Archipelagus_, Italian, _arcipelago_, the
chief sea. For the Grecian Archipelago see AEGEAN SEA. Other
archipelagoes are described in their respective places.
