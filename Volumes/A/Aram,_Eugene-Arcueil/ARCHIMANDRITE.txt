ARCHIMANDRITE (from Gr. [Greek: archon], a ruler, and [Greek: mandra], a
fold or monastery), a title in the Greek Church applied to a superior
abbot, who has the supervision of several abbots and monasteries, or to
the abbot of some specially great and important monastery, the title for
an ordinary abbot being hegumenos. The title occurs for the first time
in a letter to Epiphanius, prefixed to his _Panarium_ (c. 375), but the
_Lausiac History_ of Palladius may be evidence that it was in common use
in the 4th century as applied to Pachomius (q.v.). In Russia the bishops
are commonly selected from the archimandrites. The word occurs in the
_Regula Columbani_ (c. 7), and du Cange gives a few other cases of its
use in Latin documents, but it never came into vogue in the West. Owing
to intercourse with Greek and Slavonic Christianity, the title is
sometimes to be met with in southern Italy and Sicily, and in Hungary
and Poland.
