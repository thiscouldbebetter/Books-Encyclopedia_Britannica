ARCHITRAVE (from Lat. _arcus_, an arch, and _trabs, trabem_, a beam), an
architectural term for the chief beam which carries the superstructure
and rests immediately on the columns. In the ordinary entablature it is
the lowest of the three divisions, the other two being the frieze and
the cornice (see ORDER). The term is also applied to the moulded frame
of a doorway.
