ARCHER, WILLIAM (1856-   ), English critic, was born at Perth on the
23rd of September 1856, and was educated at Edinburgh University. He
became a leader-writer on the _Edinburgh Evening News_ in 1875, and
after a year in Australia returned to Edinburgh. In 1879 he became
dramatic critic of the _London Figaro_, and in 1884 of the _World_. In
London he soon took a prominent literary place. Mr Archer had much to do
with introducing Ibsen to the English public by his translation of _The
Pillars of Society_, produced at the Gaiety Theatre, London, in 1880. He
also translated, alone or in collaboration, other productions of the
Scandinavian stage: Ibsen's _Doll's House_ (1889), _Master Builder_
(1893); Edvard Brandes's _A Visit_ (1892); Ibsen's _Peer Gynt_ (1892);
_Little Eyolf_ (1895); and _John Gabriel Borkman_ (1897); and he edited
_Henrik Ibsen's Prose Dramas_ (5 vols., 1890-1891). Among his critical
works are:--_English Dramatists of To-day_ (1882); _Masks or Faces?_
(1888); five vols. of critical notices reprinted, _The Theatrical World_
(1893-1897); _America To-day, Observations and Reflections_; _Poets of
the Younger Generation_ (1901); _Real Conversations_ (1904).
