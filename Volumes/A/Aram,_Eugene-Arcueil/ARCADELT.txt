ARCADELT, or ARCHADELT, JACOB (c. 1514-c. 1556), a Netherlands composer,
of the early part of the Golden Age. In 1539 he left a position at
Florence to teach the choristers of St Peter's, Rome, and became one of
the papal singers in 1540. He was a prolific church composer, but the
works published in his Italian time consist entirely of madrigals, five
books of which, published at Venice, probably gave a great stimulus to
the beginnings of the Venetian school of composition. In 1555 he left
Italy and entered the service of Cardinal Charles of Lorraine, duke of
Guise, and after this published three volumes of masses, besides
contributing motets to various collections. The _Ave Maria_, ascribed to
him and transcribed as a pianoforte piece by Liszt, does not seem to be
traced to an earlier source than its edition by Sir Henry Bishop, which
has possibly the same kind of origin in Arcadelt as the hymn tune
"Palestrina" has in the delicate and subtle _Gloria_ of Palestrina's
_Magnificat Quinti Toni_, the fifth in his first _Book of Magnificats_.
