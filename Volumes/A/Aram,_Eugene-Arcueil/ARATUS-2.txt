ARATUS, of Soli in Cilicia, Greek didactic poet, a contemporary of
Callimachus and Theocritus, was born about 315 B.C. He was invited
(about 276) to the court of Antigonus Gonatas of Macedonia, where he
wrote his most famous poem, [Greek: Phainomena] (Appearances, or
Phenomena). He then spent some time with Antiochus I. of Syria; but
subsequently returned to Macedonia, where he died about 245. Aratus's
only extant works are two short poems, or two fragments of his one poem,
written in hexameters; an imitation of a prose work on astronomy by
Eudoxus of Cnidus, and [Greek: Diosaemeia] (on weather signs), chiefly
from Theophrastus. The work has all the characteristics of the
Alexandrian school of poetry. Although Aratus was ignorant of astronomy,
his poem attracted the favourable notice of distinguished specialists,
such as Hipparchus, who wrote commentaries upon it. Amongst the Romans
it enjoyed a high reputation (Ovid, _Amores_, i. 15, 16). Cicero, Caesar
Germanicus and Avienus translated it; the two last versions and
fragments of Cicero's are still extant. Quintilian (_Instit._ x. i, 55)
is less enthusiastic. Virgil has imitated the _Prognostica_ to some
extent in the _Georgics_. One verse from the opening invocation to Zeus
has become famous from being quoted by St Paul (Acts xvii. 28). Several
accounts of his life are extant, by anonymous Greek writers.
