ARCHIMEDES, SCREW OF, a machine for raising water, said to have been
invented by Archimedes, for the purpose of removing water from the hold
of a large ship that had been built by King Hiero II. of Syracuse. It
consists of a water-tight cylinder, enclosing a chamber walled off by
spiral divisions running from end to end, inclined to the horizon, with
its lower open end placed in the water to be raised. The water, while
occupying the lowest portion in each successive division of the spiral
chamber, is lifted mechanically by the turning of the machine. Other
forms have the spiral revolving free in a fixed cylinder, or consist
simply of a tube wound spirally about a cylindrical axis. The same
principle is sometimes used in machines for handling wheat, &c. (see
CONVEYORS).
