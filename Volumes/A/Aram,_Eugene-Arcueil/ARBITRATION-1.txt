ARBITRATION, INTERNATIONAL. International arbitration is a proceeding in
which two nations refer their differences to one or more selected
persons, who, after affording to each party an opportunity of being
heard, pronounce judgment on the matters at issue. It is understood,
unless otherwise expressed, that the judgment shall be in accordance
with the law by which civilized nations have agreed to be bound,
whenever such law is applicable. Some authorities, notably the eminent
Swiss jurist, J.K. Bluntschli, consider that unless this tacit condition
is complied with, the award may be set aside. This would, however, be
highly inconvenient since international law has never been codified. A
fresh arbitration might have to be entered on to decide (1) what the law
was, (2) whether it applied to the matter in hand. Arbitration differs
from Mediation (q.v.) in so far as it is a judicial act, whereas
Mediation involves no decision, but merely advice and suggestions to
those who invoke its aid.

_Arbitral Tribunals._--An international arbitrator may be the chief of a
friendly power, or he may be a private individual. When he is an
emperor, a king, or a president of a republic, it is not expected that
he will act personally; he may appoint a delegate or delegates to act on
his behalf, and avail himself of their labours and views, the ultimate
decision being his only in name. In this respect international
arbitration differs from civil arbitration, since a private arbitrator
cannot delegate his office without express authority. The analogy
between the two fails to hold good in another respect also. In civil
arbitration, the decision or award may be made a rule of court, after
which it becomes enforceable by writ of execution against person or
property. An international award cannot be enforced directly; in other
words it has no legal sanction behind it. Its obligation rests on the
good faith of the parties to the reference, and on the fact that, with
the help of a world-wide press, public opinion can always be brought to
bear on any state that seeks to evade its moral duty. The obligation of
an ordinary treaty rests on precisely the same foundations. Where there
are two or any other even number of arbitrators, provision is usually
made for an umpire (French _sur-arbitre_). The umpire may be chosen by
the arbitrators themselves or nominated by a neutral power. In the
"Alabama" arbitration five arbitrators were nominated by the president
of the United States, the queen of England, the king of Italy, the
president of the Swiss Confederation, and the emperor of Brazil
respectively. In the Bering Sea arbitration there were seven
arbitrators, two nominated by Great Britain, two by the United States,
and the remaining three by the president of the French Republic, the
king of Italy, and the king of Sweden and Norway respectively. In
neither of these cases was there an umpire; nor was any necessary, since
the decision, if not unanimous, lay with the majority. (See separate
articles on BERING SEA ARBITRATION and "ALABAMA" ARBITRATION.)

Arbitral tribunals may have to deal with questions either of law or
fact, or of both combined. When they have to deal with law only, that is
to say, to lay down a principle or decide a question of liability, their
functions are judicial or quasi-judicial, and the result is arbitration
proper. Where they have to deal with facts only, e.g. the evaluation of
pecuniary claims, their functions are administrative rather than
judicial, and the term commission is applied to them. "Mixed
commissions," so called because they are composed of representatives of
the parties in difference, have been frequently resorted to for
delimitation of frontiers, and for settling the indemnities to be paid
to the subjects of neutral powers in respect of losses sustained by
non-combatants in times of war or civil insurrection. The two earliest
of these were nominated in 1794 under the treaty negotiated by Lord
Grenville with Mr John Jay, commonly called the "Jay Treaty," their
tasks being (1) to define the boundary between Canada and the United
States which had been agreed to by the treaty signed at Paris in 1783;
(2) to estimate the amount to be paid by Great Britain and the United
States to each other in respect of illegal captures or condemnation of
vessels during the war of the American Revolution.

Although arbitrations proper may be thus distinguished from "mixed
commissions," it must not be supposed that any hard or fast theoretical
line can be drawn between them. Arbitrators strictly so called may (as
in the "Alabama" case) proceed to award damages after they have decided
the question of liability; whilst "mixed commissions," before awarding
damages, usually have to decide whether the pecuniary claims made are or
are not well founded.

_Awards._--International awards, as already pointed out, differ from
civil awards in having no legal sanction by which they can be enforced.
On the other hand, they resemble civil awards in that they may be set
aside, i.e. ignored, for sufficient reason, as, for example, if the
tribunal has not acted in good faith, or has not given to each party an
opportunity of being heard, or has exceeded its jurisdiction. An
instance under the last head occurred in 1831, when it was referred to
the king of the Netherlands as sole arbitrator to fix the north-eastern
boundary of the state of Maine. The king's representatives were unable
to draw the frontier line by reason of the imperfection of the maps then
in existence, and he therefore directed a further survey. This direction
was beyond the terms of the reference, and the award, when made, was
repudiated by the United States as void for excess. The point in dispute
was only finally disposed of by the Webster-Ashburton treaty of 1842.

_Subject-matter._--The history of international arbitration is dealt
with in the article PEACE, where treaties of general arbitration are
discussed, both those which embrace all future differences thereafter to
arise between the contracting parties, and also those more limited
conventions which aim at the settlement of all future differences in
regard to particular subjects, e.g. commerce or navigation. The rapid
growth of international arbitration in recent times may be gathered from
the following figures. Between 1820 and 1840, there were eight such
instances; between 1840 and 1860, there were thirty; between 1860 and
1880, forty-four; between 1880 and 1900, ninety. Of the governments
which were parties in these several cases Great Britain heads the list
in point of numbers, the United States of America being a good second.
France, Portugal, Spain and the Netherlands are the European states next
in order. The present article is concerned exclusively with arbitration
in regard to such existing differences as are capable of precise
statement and of prompt adjustment. These differences may be arranged in
two main groups:--

  (a) Those which have arisen between state and state in their sovereign
    capacities;

  (b) Those in which one state has made a demand upon another state,
    ostensibly in its sovereign capacity, but really on behalf of some
    individual, or set of individuals, whose interests it was bound to
    protect.

To group (a) belong territorial differences in regard to ownership of
land and rights of fishing at sea; to group (b) belong pecuniary claims
in respect of acts wrongfully done to one or more subjects of one state
by, or with the authority of, another state. To enumerate even a tenth
part of the successful arbitrations in recent times would occupy too
much space. Some prominent examples (dealt with elsewhere under their
appropriate titles) are the dispute between the United States and Great
Britain respecting the "Alabama" and other vessels employed by the
Confederate government during the American Civil War (award in 1872);
that between the same powers respecting the fur-seal fishery in Bering
Sea (award in 1893); that between Great Britain and Venezuela respecting
the boundary of British Guiana (award in 1899); that between Great
Britain, the United States and Portugal respecting the Delagoa railway
(award in 1900); that between Great Britain and the United States
respecting the boundary of Alaska (award in 1903). The long-standing
Newfoundland fishery dispute with France (finally settled in 1904) is
dealt with under Newfoundland. Other examples are shortly noticed in the
tables on p. 329, which although by no means exhaustive, sufficiently
indicate the scope and trend of arbitration during the years covered.
The cases decided by the permanent tribunal at the Hague established in
1900 are not included in these tables. They are separately discussed
later.

_The Hague Tribunal._--The establishment of a permanent tribunal at the
Hague, pursuant to the Peace convention of 1899, marks a momentous epoch
in the history of international arbitration. This tribunal realized an
idea put forward by Jeremy Bentham towards the close of the 18th
century, advocated by James Mill in the middle of the 19th century, and
worked out later by Mr Dudley Field in America, by Dr Goldschmidt in
Germany, and by Sir Edmund Hornby and Mr Leone Levi in England. The
credit of the realization is due, in the first place, to the tsar of
Russia, who initiated the Hague Conference of 1899, and, in the second
place to Lord Pauncefote (then Sir Julian Pauncefote, British ambassador
at Washington), who urged before a committee of the conference the
importance of organizing a permanent international court, the service of
which should be called into requisition at will, and who also submitted
an outline of the mode in which such a court might be formed. The result
was embodied in the following articles of the Convention, signed on
behalf of sixteen of the assembled powers on the 29th of July 1899.

  (Art. 23). Each of the signatory powers is to designate within three
  months from the ratification of the convention four persons at the
  most, of recognized competence in international law, enjoying the
  highest moral consideration, and willing to accept the duties of
  arbitrators. Two or more powers may agree to nominate one or more
  members in common, or the same person may be nominated by different
  powers. Members of the court are to be appointed for six years and may
  be re-nominated. (Art. 25). The signatory powers desiring to apply to
  the tribunal for the settlement of a difference between them are to
  notify the same to the arbitrators. The arbitrators who are to
  determine this difference are, unless otherwise specially agreed, to
  be chosen from the general list of members in the following
  manner:--each party is to name two arbitrators, and these are to
  choose a chief arbitrator or umpire (_sur-arbitre_). If the votes are
  equally divided the selection of the chief arbitrator is to be
  entrusted to a third power to be named by the parties. (Art. 26). The
  tribunal is to sit at the Hague when practicable, unless the parties
  otherwise agree. (Art. 27). "The signatory powers consider it a duty
  in the event of an acute conflict threatening to break out between two
  or more of them to remind these latter that the permanent court is
  open to them. This action is only to be considered as an exercise of
  good offices." Several of the powers nominated members of the
  permanent court pursuant to Art. 25, quoted above, those nominated on
  behalf of Great Britain being Lord Pauncefote, Sir Edward Malet, Sir
  Edward Fry and Professor Westlake. On the death of Lord Pauncefote,
  Major-General Sir John C. Ardagh was appointed in his place.

    The pious fund of the Californias.

  _Hague Cases._--(1) The first case decided by the Hague court was
  concerned with the "Pious Fund of the Californias." A fund bearing
  this name was formed in the 18th century for the purpose of converting
  to the Catholic faith the native Indians of Upper and Lower
  California, both of which then belonged to Mexico, and of maintaining
  a Catholic priesthood there. By a decree of 1842 this fund was
  transferred to the public treasury of Mexico, the Mexican government
  undertaking to pay interest thereon in perpetuity in furtherance of
  the design of the original donors. After the sale of Upper California
  to the United States, effected by the treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo
  (1848), the Mexican government refused to pay the proportion of the
  interest to which Upper California was entitled. The question of
  liability was then referred to commissioners appointed by each state,
  and, on their failing to agree, to Sir Edward Thornton, British
  minister at Washington, who by his award, in 1875, found there was due
  from Mexico to Upper California, or rather to the bishops there as
  administrators of the fund, an arrear of interest amounting to nearly
  $100,000, which was directed to be paid in gold. This award was
  carried out, but payment of the current interest was again withheld as
  from the 24th of October 1868. Claim was thereupon made on Mexico by
  the United States on behalf of the bishops, but without success.
  Ultimately, in May 1902, an agreement was come to between the two
  governments which provided for the settlement of the dispute by the
  Hague tribunal. The points to be determined were (1) whether the
  matter was _res judicata_ by reason of Sir E. Thornton's award; (2)
  whether, if not, the claim for the interest was just. The arbitrators
  selected by the United States were Sir E. Fry and Professor F. de
  Martens, and by Mexico, Professor Asser and Professor de Savornin
  Lohman, both of Amsterdam. These four (none of whom, it will be
  observed, was of the nationality of either party in difference) chose
  for their umpire Professor Matzen, of Copenhagen, president of the
  Landsthing there. In October 1902, the court decided both questions in
  the affirmative, awarding the payment by Mexico of the annual sum
  claimed, not in gold, but _en monnaie ayant cours légal au Mexique_.
  The direction to pay in gold made by Sir E. Thornton was held to be
  referable only to the mode of the execution of the award, and
  therefore not to be _chose jugée_.

    Great Britain, Germany and Italy versus Venezuela.

  (2) The second arbitration before the Hague court was more important
  than the first, not only because so many of the great powers were
  concerned in it, but also because it brought about the discontinuance
  of acts of war. The facts may be stated shortly thus. By three several
  protocols signed at Washington in February 1903, it was agreed that
  certain claims by Great Britain, Germany and Italy, on behalf of their
  respective subjects against the Venezuelan government should be
  referred to three mixed commissions, and that for the purpose of
  securing the payment of these claims 30 percent of the customs
  revenues at the ports of La Guayra and Puerto Caballo should be
  remitted in monthly instalments to the representative of the Bank of
  England at Caracas. Prior to the date of these protocols, an attempt
  had been made by Great Britain, Germany and Italy to enforce their
  claims by blockade, and a further question arose as between these
  three powers on the one hand, and the United States of America,
  France, Spain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Sweden and Norway, and Mexico
  (all of whom had claims against Venezuela, but had abstained from
  hostile action) on the other hand, as to whether the blockading powers
  were entitled to preferential treatment. By three several protocols
  signed in May 1903 this question was agreed to be submitted to the
  Hague court, three members of which were to be named as arbitrators by
  the tsar of Russia, but no arbitrator was to be a subject or citizen
  of any of the signatory or creditor powers. The arbitrators named by
  the tsar were M. Muraviev, minister of justice and attorney-general of
  the Russian empire; Professor Lammasch, member of the Upper House of
  the Austrian parliament; and M. de Martens, then member of the council
  of the ministry of foreign affairs at St Petersburg. The arbitrators
  by their award in February 1904 decided unanimously in favour of the
  blockading powers and ordered payment of their claims out of the 30%
  of the receipts at the two Venezuelan ports which had been set apart
  to meet them.

    Great Britain, France and Germany versus Japan.

  (3) The third case before the Hague court was heard in 1904-1905. A
  controversy not amenable to ordinary diplomatic methods arose between
  Great Britain, France and Germany on the one hand and Japan on the
  other hand as to the legality of a house-tax imposed by Japan on
  certain subjects of those powers who held leases in perpetuity. The
  question upon the true construction of certain treaties between the
  European powers and Japan which had been made a few years previously.
  By three protocols signed at Tokyo in August 1902 this question was
  agreed to be submitted to arbitrators, members of the court at the
  Hague, one to be chosen by each party with power to name an umpire.
  The arbitrators chosen were M. Renault, professor of the law faculty
  in Paris, and M. Montono, the Japanese envoy to the French capital.
  They named as their umpire and president M. Gram, ex-minister of the
  state of Norway. In May 1905, an award was pronounced by the majority
  (M. Gram and M. Renault) in favour of the European contention, M.
  Montono dissenting both from the conclusion of his colleagues and from
  the reasons on which it was based.

    Great Britain and the French flag at Muscat.

  (4) Barely two months had elapsed since the date of the last award
  when the Hague court was again called into requisition. The scene of
  dispute this time was on the S.E. coast of Arabia. Muscat, the capital
  of the kingdom of Oman on that coast, is ruled by a sultan, whose
  independence both Great Britain and France had, in March 1862,
  "reciprocally engaged to respect." Notwithstanding this, the French
  republic had issued to certain native dhows, owned by subjects of the
  sultan, papers authorizing them to fly the French flag, not only on
  the Oman littoral but in the Red Sea. A question thereupon arose as to
  the manner in which the privileges thereby purported to be conferred
  affected the jurisdiction of the sultan over such dhows, the masters
  of which, as was alleged, used their immunity from search for the
  purpose of carrying on contraband trade in slaves, arms and
  ammunition. In October 1904 the two governments agreed to refer this
  question to the Hague court. Chief Justice Melville W. Fuller, of the
  Supreme Court of the United States, was named as arbitrator on the
  part of Great Britain, M. de Savornin Lohrnan, who had acted in the
  case of the Californias (No. 1), as arbitrator on the part of France.
  The choice of an umpire was entrusted to the king of Italy. He named
  Professor Lammasch, who, as we have seen, had acted in the arbitration
  with Venezuela in 1903.

  A unanimous award was made in August 1905. It was held that although
  generally speaking every sovereign may decide to whom he will accord
  the right to fly his flag, yet in this case such right was limited by
  the general act of the Brussels conference of July 1890 relative to
  the African slave trade, an act which was ratified by France on the
  2nd of June 1892; that accordingly the owners and master of dhows who
  had been authorized by France to fly the French flag before the
  last-named date retained this authorization so long as France chose
  to renew it, but that after that date such authorization was improper
  unless the guarantees could establish that they had been treated by
  France as her protégés within the meaning of that term as explained in
  a treaty of 1863 between France and Morocco. A further point decided
  was that the owners or master of dhows duly authorized to fly the
  French flag within the ruling of the first point, did not enjoy, in
  consequence of that fact, any such right of extra-territoriality as
  would exempt them from the sovereignty and jurisdiction of the sultan.
  Such exemption would be contrary to the engagement to respect the
  independence of the sultan solemnly made in 1862.

_Arbitral Procedure._--Not the least of the benefits of the Hague
convention of 1899 (strengthened by that of 1907) is that it contains
rules of procedure which furnish a guide for all arbitrations whether
conducted before the Hague court or not. These may be summarized as
follows:--The initial step is the making by the parties of a special
agreement clearly defining the subject of the dispute. The next is the
choice of the arbitrators and of an umpire if the number of arbitrators
is even. Each party then by its agents prepares and presents its case in
a narrative or argumentative form, annexing thereto all relevant
documents. The cases so presented are interchanged by transmission to
the opposite party. The hearing consists in the discussion of the
matters contained in the several cases, and is conducted under the
direction of the president who is either the umpire, or, if there is no
umpire, one of the arbitrators. The members of the tribunal have the
right of putting questions to the counsel and agents of the parties and
to demand from them explanation of doubtful points. The arbitral
judgment is read out at a public sitting of the tribunal, the counsel
and agents having been duly summoned to hear it. Any application for a
revision of the award must be based on the discovery of new evidence of
such a nature as to exercise a decisive influence on the judgment and
unknown up to the time when the hearing was closed, both to the tribunal
itself and to the party asking for the revision. These general rules are
universally applicable, but each case may require that special rules
should be added to them. These each tribunal must make for itself.

One special and necessary rule is in regard to the language to be
employed. This rule must vary according to convenience and is therefore
made _ad hoc_. In case No. 1 noted above, the court allowed English or
French to be spoken according to the nationality of the counsel engaged.
The judgment was delivered in French only. In case No. 2 it was agreed
that the written and printed memoranda should be in English but might be
accompanied by a translation into the language of the power on whose
behalf they were put in. The oral discussion was either in English or
French as happened to be convenient. The judgment was drawn up in both
languages. In case No. 3 French was the official language throughout,
but the parties were allowed to make any communication to the tribunal,
in French, English, German or Japanese. In case No. 4 French was again
the official language, but the counsel and agents of both parties were
allowed to address the tribunal in English. The protocols and the
judgment were drawn up in French accompanied by an official English
translation.

_Limits of International Arbitration._--Of the numerous treaties for
general arbitration which have been made during the 20th century that
between Great Britain and France (1903) is a type. This treaty contains
reservations of all questions involving the vital interests, the
independence or the honour of the contracting parties. The language of
the reservation is open to more interpretations than one. What, for
instance, is meant by the phrase "national independence" in this
connexion? If it be taken in its strict acceptation of autonomous state
sovereignty, the exception is somewhat of a truism. No self-respecting
power would, of course, consent to submit to arbitration a question of
life or death. This would be as if two men were to agree to draw lots as
to which should commit suicide in order to avoid fighting a duel. On the
other hand, if the exception be taken to exclude all questions which,
when decided adversely to a state, impose a restraint on its freedom of
action, then the exception would seem to exclude such a question as the
true interpretation of an ambiguous treaty, a subject with which
experience shows international arbitration is well fitted to deal.
Again, we may ask, what is meant by the phrase "national honour"? It was
thought at one time that the honour of a nation could only be vindicated
by war, though all that had happened was the slighting of its flag, or
of its accredited representative, during some sudden ebullition of local
feeling. France once nearly broke off peaceful relations with Spain
because her ambassador at London was assigned a place below the Spanish
ambassador, and on another occasion she despatched troops into Italy
because her ambassador at Rome had been insulted by the friends and
partisans of the pope. The truth is that the extent to which national
honour is involved depends on factors which have nothing to do with the
immediate subject of complaint. So long as general good feeling subsists
between two nations, neither will easily take offence at any
discourteous act of the other. But when a deep-seated antagonism is
concealed beneath an unruffled surface, the most trivial incident will
bring it to the light of day. "Outraged national honour" is a highly
elastic phrase. It may serve as a pretext for a serious quarrel whether
the alleged "outrage" be great or small.

The prospects of the expansion of international arbitration will be more
clearly perceived if we classify afresh all state differences under two
heads:--(1) those which have a legal character, (2) those which have a
political character. Under "legal differences" may be ranged such as are
capable of being decided, when once the facts are ascertained, by
settled, recognized rules, or by rules not settled nor recognized, but
(as in the "Alabama" case) taken so to be for the purpose in hand.
Boundary cases and cases of indemnity for losses sustained by
non-combatants in time of war, of which several instances have already
been mentioned, belong to this class. To the same class belong those
cases in which the arbitrators have to adapt the provisions of an old
treaty to new and altered circumstances, somewhat in the way in which
English courts of justice apply the doctrine of "cy-près." "Political
differences" on the other hand, are such as affect states in their
external relations, or in relation to their subjects or dependants who
may be in revolt against them. Some of these differences may be slight,
while others may be vital, or (which amounts to the same thing) may seem
to the parties to be so. All differences falling under the first of
these two general heads appear to be suitable for international
arbitration. Differences falling under the second general head are, for
the most part, unsuitable, and may only be adjusted (if at all) through
the mediation of a friendly power.

The interesting problem of the future is--are we to regard this
classification as fixed or as merely transitory? The answer depends on
several considerations which can only be glanced at here. It may be
that, just as the usages of civilized nations have slowly crystallized
into international law, so there may come a time when the political
principles that govern states in relation to each other will be so
clearly defined and so generally accepted as to acquire something of a
legal or quasi-legal character. If they do, they will pass the line
which at present separates arbitrable from non-arbitrable matter. This
is the juridical aspect of the problem. But there is also an economic
side to it by reason of the conditions of modern warfare. Already the
nations are groaning under the burdens of militarism, and are for ever
diverting energies that might be employed in the furtherance of useful
productive work to purposes of an opposite character. The interruption
of maritime intercourse, the stagnation of industry and trade, the rise
in the price of the necessaries of life, the impossibility of adequately
providing for the families of those--call them reservists, "landwehr,"
or what you will--who are torn away from their daily toil to serve in
the tented field,--these are considerations that may well make us pause
before we abandon a peaceful solution and appeal to brute force. Lastly,
there is the moral aspect of the problem. In order that international
arbitration may do its perfect work, it is not enough to set up a
standing tribunal, whether at the Hague or elsewhere, and to equip it
with elaborate rules of procedure. Tribunals and rules are, after all,
only machinery. If this machinery is to act smoothly we must improve our
motive power, the source of which is human passion and sentiment.
Although religious animosities between Christian nations have died out,
although dynasties may now rise and fall without raising half Europe to
arms, the springs of warlike enterprise are still to be found in
commercial jealousies, in imperialistic ambitions and in the doctrine of
the survival of the fittest which lends scientific support to both.
These must one and all be cleared away before we can enter on that era
of universal peace towards the attainment of which the tsar of Russia
declared, in his famous circular of 1898, the efforts of all governments
should be directed. Meanwhile it is legitimate to share the hope
expressed by President Roosevelt in his message to Congress of December
1905 that some future Hague conference may succeed in making arbitration
the customary method of settling international disputes in all save the
few classes of cases indicated above, and that--to quote Mr Roosevelt's
words--"these classes may themselves be as sharply defined and rigidly
limited as the governmental and social development of the world will for
the time being permit."

  Of works in English there is a singular dearth. The most important is
  by an American, J.B. Moore, _History of the International Arbitrations
  to which the United States has been a Party_ (Washington, 1898). The
  appendices to this work (which is in six volumes) contain, with much
  other matter of great value, full historical notes of arbitrations
  between other powers. Arbitration and mediation will be found briefly
  noticed in Phillimore's _International Law_; in Sir Henry Maine's
  _Lectures_, delivered in Cambridge in 1887; in W.E. Hall's
  _International Law_, and more at length in an interesting paper
  contributed by John Westlake to the _International Journal of Ethics_,
  October 1896, which its author has reprinted privately. A London
  journal, _The Herald of Peace and International Arbitration_, issued
  some years ago a list of instances in which arbitration or mediation
  had been successfully resorted to during the 19th century. David
  Dudley Field, of New York, subsequently enlarged this list, which has
  been continued under the title _International Tribunals_, by Dr W.
  Evans Darby, and is published, along with the texts of several
  projects for general arbitration, at the offices of the Peace Society,
