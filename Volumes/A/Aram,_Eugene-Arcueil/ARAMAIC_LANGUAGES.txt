ARAMAIC LANGUAGES, a class of languages so called from Aram, a
geographical term, which in old Semitic usage designates nearly the same
districts as the Greek word Syria. Aram, however, does not include
Palestine, while it comprehends Mesopotamia (Heb. Aram of two rivers), a
region which the Greeks frequently distinguish from Syria proper. Thus
the Aramaic languages may be geographically defined as the Semitic
dialects originally current in Mesopotamia and the regions extending
south-west from the Euphrates to Palestine. (See SEMITIC LANGUAGES;
SYRIAC; TARGUM.)
