ARBACES, according to Ctesias (Diodor. ii. 24 ff. 32), one of the
generals of Sardanapalus, king of Assyria and founder of the Median
empire about 830 B.C. But Ctesias's whole history of the Assyrian and
Median empires is absolutely fabulous; his Arbaces and his successors
are not historical personages. From the inscriptions of Sargon of
Assyria we know one "Arbaku Dynast of Arnashia" as one of forty-five
chiefs of Median districts who paid tribute to Sargon in 713 B.C. See
