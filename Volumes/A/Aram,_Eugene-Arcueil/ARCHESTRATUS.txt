ARCHESTRATUS, of Syracuse or Gela, a Greek poet, who flourished about
330 B.C. After travelling extensively in search of foreign delicacies
for the table, he embodied the result in a humorous poem called [Greek:
Hedupatheta], afterwards freely translated by Ennius under the title
_Heduphagetica_. About 300 lines of this gastronomical poem are
preserved in Athenaeus. The writer, who has been styled the Hesiod or
Theognis of gluttons, parodies the style of the old gnomic poets; chief
attention is paid to details concerning fish.
