ARATOR, of Liguria, a Christian poet, who lived during the 6th century.
He was an orphan, and owed his early education to Laurentius, archbishop
of Milan, and Ennodius, bishop of Pavia, who took great interest in him.
After completing his studies, he practised with success as an advocate,
and was appointed to an influential post at the court of Athalaric, king
of the Ostrogoths. About 540, he quitted the service of the state, took
orders and was elected sub-deacon of the Roman Church. He gained the
favour of Pope Vigilius, to whom he dedicated his _De Actibus
Aposlolorum_ (written about 544), which was much admired in the middle
ages. The poem, consisting of some 2500 hexameters, is of little merit,
being full of mystical and allegorical interpretations and long-winded
digressions; the versification, except for certain eccentricities in
prosody, is generally correct.
