ARCOLA, a village of northern Italy, 16 m. E.S.E. of Verona, on the
Alpone stream, near its confluence with the Adige below Verona. The
village gives its name to the three days' battle of Arcola (15th, 16th
and 17th of November 1796), in which the French, under General Napoleon
Bonaparte, defeated the Austrians commanded by Allvintzy (see FRENCH
REVOLUTIONARY WARS).
