ARCTURUS, the brightest star in the northern hemisphere, situated in the
constellation Boötes (q.v.) in an almost direct line with the tail
([zeta] and [eta]) of the constellation Ursa Major (Great Bear); hence
its derivation from the Gr. [Greek: arktos], bear, and [Greek: ouros],
guard. Arcturus has been supposed to be referred to in various passages
of the Hebrew Bible; the Vulgate reads Arcturus for stars mentioned in
Job ix. 9, xxxvii. 9, xxxviii. 31, as well as Amos v. 8. Other versions,
as also modern authorities, have preferred, e.g., Orion, the Pleiades,
the Scorpion, the Great Bear (of. _Amos_ in the "International Critical
Comment" series, and G. Schiaparelli, _Astronomy in the O.T._, Eng.
trans., Oxford, 1905, ch. iv.). According to one of the Greek legends
about Arcas, son of Lycaon, king of Arcadia, he was killed by his father
and his flesh was served up in a banquet to Zeus, who was indignant at
the crime and restored him to life. Subsequently Arcas, when hunting,
chanced to pursue his mother Callisto, who had been transformed into a
bear, as far as the temple of Lycaean Zeus; to prevent the crime of
matricide Zeus transported them both to the heavens (Ovid, _Metam_. ii.
410), where Callisto became the constellation Ursa Major, and Areas the
star Arcturus (see LYCAON and CALLISTO).
