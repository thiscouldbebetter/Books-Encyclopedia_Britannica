ARBOUR, or ARBOR (originally "herber" or "erber," O. Fr. _herbier_, from
Lat. _herbarium_, a collection of herbs, _herba_, grass; the word came
to be spelt "arber" through its pronunciation, as in the case of Derby,
and by the 16th century was written "arbour," helped by a confusion of
derivation from Lat. _arbor_, a tree, and by change of meaning), a
grass-plot or lawn, a herb-garden, or orchard, and a shady bower of
interlaced trees, or climbing plants trained on lattice-work. The
application of the word has shifted from the grass-covered ground, the
proper meaning, to the covering of trees overhead. "Arbor" (from the
Latin for "tree") is a term applied to the spindle of a wheel,
particularly in clock-making.
