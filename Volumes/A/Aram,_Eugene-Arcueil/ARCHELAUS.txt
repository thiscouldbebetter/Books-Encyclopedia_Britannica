ARCHELAUS, king of Judaea, was the son of Herod the Great. He received
the kingdom of Judaea by the last will of his father, though a previous
will had bequeathed it to his brother Antipas. He was proclaimed king by
the army, but declined to assume the title until he had submitted his
claims to Augustus at Rome. Before setting out, he quelled with the
utmost cruelty a sedition of the Pharisees, slaying nearly 3000 of them.
At Rome he was opposed by Antipas and by many of the Jews, who feared
his cruelty; but Augustus allotted to him the greater part of the
kingdom (Judaea, Samaria, Ituraea) with the title of ethnarch. He
married Glaphyra, the widow of his brother Alexander, though his wife
and her second husband, Juba, king of Mauretania, were alive. This
violation of the Mosaic law and his continued cruelty roused the Jews,
who complained to Augustus. Archelaus was deposed (A.D. 7) and banished
to Vienne. The date of his death is unknown.

Archelaus is mentioned in Matt. ii. 22, and the parable of Luke xix. 11
f. probably refers to his journey to Rome.
