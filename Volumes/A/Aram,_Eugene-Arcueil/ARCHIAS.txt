ARCHIAS, AULUS LICINIUS, Greek poet, was born at Antioch in Syria 120
B.C. In 102, his reputation having been already established, especially
as an improvisatore, he came to Rome, where he was well received amongst
the highest and most influential families. His chief patron was
Lucullus, whose gentile name he assumed. In 93 he visited Sicily with
his patron, on which occasion he received the citizenship of Heracleia,
one of the federate towns, and indirectly, by the provisions of the lex
Plautia Papiria, that of Rome. In 61 he was accused by a certain Gratius
of having assumed the citizenship illegally; and Cicero successfully
defended him in his speech _Pro Archia_. This speech, which furnishes
nearly all the information concerning Archias, states that he had
celebrated the deeds of Marius and Lucullus in the Cimbrian and
Mithradatic wars, and that he was engaged upon a poem of which the
events of Cicero's consulship formed the subject. The Greek Anthology
contains thirty-five epigrams under the name of Archias, but it is
doubtful how many of these (if any) are the work of the poet of Antioch.
