ARCELLA (C.G. Ehrenberg), a genus of lobose Rhizopoda, characterized by
a chitinous plano-convex shell, the circular aperture central on the
flat ventral face, and more than one nucleus and contractile vacuole. It
can develop vacuoles, or rather fine bubbles of carbonic acid gas in its
cytoplasm, to float up to the surface of the water.
