ARCHPRIEST (Lat. _archipresbyter_, Gr. [Greek: archipresbyteros]), in
the Christian Church, originally the title of the chief of the priests
in a diocese. The office appears as early as the 4th century as that of
the priest who presided over the presbyters of the diocese and assisted
the bishop in matters of public worship, much as the archdeacon helped
him in administrative affairs. Where, as in Germany, the dioceses were
of vast extent, these were divided into several archpresbyterates. Out
of these developed the rural deaneries, the office of archpriest being
ultimately merged in that of rural dean, with which it became
synonymous. It thus became strictly subordinate to the jurisdiction of
the archdeacon. In Rome itself, as the office of archdeacon grew into
that of cardinal-camerlengo, so that of archpriest of St Peter's
developed into that of the cardinal-vicar. In England from 1598 until
the appointment of a vicar-apostolic in 1623 the Roman Catholic clergy
were placed by the pope under an "archpriest" as superior of the English
mission. In the Lutheran Church in Germany the title archpriest
(_Erzpriester_) was in some cases long retained as the equivalent of
that of superintendent, sometimes also still called dean (_Dechant_),
his functions being much the same as those of the rural dean.
