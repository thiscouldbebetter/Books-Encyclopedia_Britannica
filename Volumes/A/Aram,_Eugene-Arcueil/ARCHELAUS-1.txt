ARCHELAUS, king of Macedonia (413-399 B.C.), was the son of Perdiccas
and a slave mother. He obtained the throne by murdering his uncle, his
cousin and his half-brother, the legitimate heir, but proved a capable
and beneficent ruler. He fortified cities, constructed roads and
organized the army. He endeavoured to spread among his people the
refinements of Greek civilization, and invited to his court, which he
removed from Aegae to Pella, many celebrated men, amongst them Zeuxis,
Timotheus, Euripides and Agathon. In 399 he was killed by one of his
favourites while hunting; according to another account he was the victim
of a conspiracy.
