ARBOR DAY, the name applied in the United States of America to a day
appointed for the public planting of trees (see ARBOUR). Originating, or
at least being first successfully put into operation, in Nebraska in
1872 through the instrumentality of J. Sterling Morton, then president
of the state Board of Agriculture, it received the official sanction of
the state by the proclamation of Governor R.W. Furnas in 1874 and by the
enactment in 1885 of a law establishing it as a legal holiday in
Nebraska. The movement spread rapidly throughout the United States until
with hardly an exception every state and territory celebrates such a day
either as a legal or a school holiday. The time of celebration varies in
different states--sometimes even in different localities in the same
state--but April or early May is the rule in the northern states, and
February, January and December are the months in various southern
states. A like practice has been introduced in New Zealand.
