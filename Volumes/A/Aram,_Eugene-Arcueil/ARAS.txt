ARAS, the anc. _Araxes_, and the _Phasis_ of Xenophon (Turk. and Arab.
_Ras_, Armen. _Yerash_, Georg. _Rashki_), a river which rises south of
Erzerum, in the Bingeul-dagh, and flows east through the province of
Erzerum, across the Pasin plateau, and then through Russian Armenia,
passing between Mount Ararat and Erivan, and forming the Russo-Persian
frontier. Its course is about 600 m. long; its principal tributary is
the Zanga, which flows by Erivan and drains Lake Gokcha or Sevanga. It
is a rapid and muddy stream, dangerous to cross when swollen by the
melting of the snows in Armenia, but fordable in its ordinary state. It
formerly joined the Kura; but in 1897 it changed its lower course, and
now runs direct to the Kizil-agach Bay of the Caspian. On an island in
its bed stood Artaxata, the capital of Armenia from 180 B.C. to A.D. 50.
