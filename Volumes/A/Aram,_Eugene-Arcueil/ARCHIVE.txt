ARCHIVE (Lat. _archivum_, a transliteration of Gr. [Greek: archeion], an
official building), a term (generally used in the plural "archives"),
properly denoting the building in which are kept the records, charters
and other papers belonging to any state, community or family, but now
generally applied to the documents themselves (see RECORD).
