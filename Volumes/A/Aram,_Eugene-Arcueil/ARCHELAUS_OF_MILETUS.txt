ARCHELAUS OF MILETUS, Greek philosopher of the 5th century B.C., was
born probably at Athens, though Diogenes Laërtius (ii. 16) says at
Miletus. He was a pupil of Anaxagoras, and is said by Ion of Chios
(_ap_. Diog. Laërt. ii. 23) to have been the teacher of Socrates. Some
argue that this is probably only an attempt to connect Socrates with the
Ionian school; others (e.g. Gomperz, _Greek Thinkers_) uphold the story.
There is similar difference of opinion as regards the statement that
Archelaus formulated certain ethical doctrines. In general, he followed
Anaxagoras, but in his cosmology he went back to the earlier Ionians. He
postulated primitive Matter, identical with air and mingled with Mind,
thus avoiding the dualism of Anaxagoras. Out of this conscious "air," by
a process of thickening and thinning, arose cold and warmth, or water
and fire, the one passive, the other active. The earth and the heavenly
bodies are formed from mud, the product of fire and water, from which
springs also man, at first in his lower forms. Man differs from animals
by the possession of the moral and artistic faculty. No fragments of
Archelaus remain; his doctrines have to be extracted from Diogenes
Laërtius, Simplicius, Plutarch and Hippolytus.
