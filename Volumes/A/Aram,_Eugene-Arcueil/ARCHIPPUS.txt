ARCHIPPUS, an Athenian poet of the Old Comedy, who flourished towards
the end of the 5th century B.C. His most famous play was the _Fishes_,
in which he satirized the fondness of the Athenian epicures for fish.
The Alexandrian critics attributed to him the authorship of four plays
previously assigned to Aristophanes. Archippus was ridiculed by his
contemporaries for his fondness for playing upon words (Schol. on
Aristophanes, _Wasps_, 481).

  Titles and fragments of six plays are preserved, for which see T.
  Kock, _Comicorum Atticorum Fragmenta_, i. (1880); or A. Meineke,
  _Poetarum Comicorum Graecorum Fragmenta_ (1855).
