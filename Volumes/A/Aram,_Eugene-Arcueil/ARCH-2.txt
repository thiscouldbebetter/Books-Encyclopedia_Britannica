ARCH, JOSEPH (1826-   ), English politician, founder of the National
Agricultural Labourers' Union, was born at Barford, a village in
Warwickshire, on the 10th of November 1826. His parents belonged to the
labouring class. He inherited a strong sentiment of independence from
his mother; and his objections to the social homage expected by those
whom the catechism boldly styled his "betters" made him an "agitator."
Having educated himself by unremitting exertions, and acquired fluency
of speech as a Methodist local preacher, he founded in 1872 the National
Agricultural Labourers' Union, of which he was president. A rise then
came in the wages of agricultural labourers, but this had the unforeseen
effect of destroying the union; for the labourers, deeming their object
gained, ceased to "agitate." Mr Arch nevertheless retained sufficient
popularity to be returned to parliament for north-west Norfolk in 1885;
and although defeated next year owing to his advocacy of Irish Home
Rule, he regained his seat in 1892, and held it in 1895, retiring in
1900. He was deservedly respected in the House of Commons; seldom has an
agitator been so little of a demagogue.

  A biography written by himself or under his direction, and edited by
  Lady Warwick (1898), tells the story of his career.
