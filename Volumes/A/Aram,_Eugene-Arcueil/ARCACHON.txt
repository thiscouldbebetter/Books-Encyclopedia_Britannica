ARCACHON, a coast town of south-western France, in the department of
Gironde, 37 m. W.S.W. of Bordeaux on the Southern railway. Pop. (1906)
9006. Arcachon is situated on the southern border of the lagoon of
Arcachon at the foot of dunes covered with splendid pine-woods. It
comprises two distinct parts, the summer town, extending for 2½ m. along
the shore, and bordered by a firm sandy beach, frequented by bathers,
and the winter town, farther inland, consisting of numerous villas
scattered amongst the pines.

Owing to the mildness of its climate the winter town is a resort for
consumptive patients. The principal industries are oyster-breeding,
which is conducted on a very large scale, and fishing. The port has
trade with Spain and England.
