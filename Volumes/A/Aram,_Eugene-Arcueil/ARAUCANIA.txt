ARAUCANIA, the name of a large territory of Chile, South America, S. of
the Bio-bio river, belonging to the Araucanian Indians (see below) at
the time of their independence of Spanish and Chilean authority. The
loss of their political independence has been followed by that of the
greater part of their territory, which has been divided up into the
Chilean provinces of Arauco, Bio-bio, Malleco and Cautin, and the
Indians, much reduced in number, now live in the wooded recesses of the
three provinces last named.
