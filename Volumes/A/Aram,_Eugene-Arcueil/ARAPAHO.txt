ARAPAHO (possibly from the Pawnee for "trader"), a tribe of North
American Indians of Algonquian stock. They formerly ranged over the
central portion of the plains between the Platte and Arkansas. They were
a brave, warlike, predatory tribe. With the Sioux and Cheyennes they
waged unremitting warfare upon the Utes. The southern divisions of the
tribe were placed (1867) on a reservation in the west of Indian
Territory (now Oklahoma), while the northern are in western Wyoming. The
southern section sold their reservations in 1892 and became American
citizens. The Arapahos number in all some 2000.
