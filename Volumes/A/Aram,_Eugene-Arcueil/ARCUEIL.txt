ARCUEIL, a town of northern France, in the department of Seine, on the
Bièvre, 2½ m. N.E. of Sceaux on the railway from Paris to Limours. Pop.
(1906) 8660. The town has an interesting church dating from the 13th to
the 15th century. It takes its name from a Roman aqueduct, the _Arcus
Juliani_ (Arculi), some traces of which still remain. In 1613-1624 a
bridge-aqueduct over 1300 ft. long was constructed to convey water from
the spring of Rungis some 4 m. south of Arcueil, across the Bièvre to
the Luxembourg palace in Paris. In 1868-1872 another aqueduct, still
longer, was superimposed above that of the 17th century, forming part of
the system conveying water from the river Vanne to Paris. The two
together reach a height of about 135 ft. Bleaching, and the manufacture
of bottle capsules, patent leather and other articles are carried on at
Arcueil; and there are important stone quarries.
