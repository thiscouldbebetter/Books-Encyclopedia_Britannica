ARCADIUS, of Antioch, Greek grammarian, flourished in the 2nd century
A.D. According to Suidas, he wrote treatises on orthography and syntax,
and an onomaticon (vocabulary), described as a wonderful production. An
epitome of the great work of Herodian on general prosody in twenty
books, wrongly attributed to Arcadius, is probably the work of
Theodosius of Alexandria or a grammarian named Aristodemus. This epitome
([Greek: Peri Tonon]) only includes nineteen books of the original work;
the twentieth is the work of a forger of the 16th century. Although
meagre and carelessly put together, it is valuable, since it preserves
the order of the original and thus affords a trustworthy foundation for
its reconstruction.
