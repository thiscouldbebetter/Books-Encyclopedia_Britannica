ARASON, JON (1484-1551), Icelandic bishop and poet, became a priest
about 1504, and having attracted the notice of Gottskalk, bishop of
Holar, was sent by that prelate on two missions to Norway. In 1522 he
succeeded Gottskalk in the see of Holar, but he was soon driven out by
the other Icelandic bishop, Ogmund of Skalholt. His exile, however, was
brief, and some years after his return he became involved in a dispute
with his sovereign, Christian III., king of Denmark, because he refused
to further the progress of Lutheranism in the island. Then in 1548, when
a large number of the islanders had accepted the reformed doctrines,
Arason and Ogmund joined their forces and attacked the Lutherans. Civil
war broke out, and in 1551 the bishop of Holar and two of his sons were
captured and executed. Arason, who was the last Roman Catholic bishop in
Iceland, is celebrated as a poet, and as the man who introduced printing
into the island.
