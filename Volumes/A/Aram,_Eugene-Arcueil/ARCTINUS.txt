ARCTINUS, of Miletus, one of the earliest poets of Greece and
contributors to the epic cycle. He flourished probably about 744 B.C.
(Ol. 7). His poems are lost, but an idea of them can be gained from the
_Chrestomathy_ written by Proclus the Neo-Platonist of the 5th century
or by a grammarian of the same name in the time of the Antonines. The
_Aethiopis_ [Greek: Aithiopis], in five books, was so called from the
Aethiopian Memnon, who became the ally of the Trojans after the death of
Hector. As the opening shows, it took up the narrative from the close of
the _Iliad_. It begins with the famous deeds and death of the Amazon
Penthesileia, and concludes with the death and burial of Achilles and
the dispute between Ajax and Odysseus for his arms. The title thus only
applied to part of the poem. The _Sack of Troy_ ([Greek: Iliou Perois])
gives the stories of the wooden horse, Sinon, and Laocoon, the capture
of the city, and the departure of the Greeks under the wrath of Athene
at the outrage of Ajax on Cassandra. The _Little Iliad_ ([Greek: Igias
mikra]) of Lesches formed the transition between the _Aethiopis_ and the
_Sack of Troy_.
