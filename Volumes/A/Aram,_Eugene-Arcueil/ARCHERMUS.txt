ARCHERMUS, a Chian sculptor of the middle of the 6th century B.C. His
father Micciades, and his sons, Bupalus and Athenis, were all sculptors
of marble, using doubtless the fine marble of their native land. The
school excelled in draped female figures. Archermus is said by a
scholiast (on Aristophanes' _Birds_, v. 573) to have been the first to
represent Victory and Love with wings. This statement gives especial
interest to a discovery made at Delos of a basis signed by Micciades and
Archermus which was connected with a winged female figure in rapid
motion (see GREEK ART), a figure naturally at first regarded as the
Victory of Archermus. Unfortunately further investigation has
discredited the notion that the statue belongs to the basis, which seems
rather to have supported a sphinx.
