AURAY, a town of France near the mouth of the Auray river, in the
department of Morbihan, 12 m. W. of Vannes on the railway between that
town and Lorient. Pop. (1906) 5241. Its port, which is formed by the
channel of the river and divides the town into two parts, is frequented
by coasting and fishing vessels. The principal buildings are the church
of St Esprit (13th century) now secularized; the Renaissance church of
St Gildas; the town-hall (18th century); and, at a short distance from
the town, the Carthusian monastery, now a deaf and dumb institute, on
the site of the battle of 1364, at which Charles of Blois was defeated
by John of Montfort (see BRITTANY: _History_). Adjoining the Chartreuse
is a small chapel in which are preserved the bones of the Royalists
captured by the Republicans in a battle fought near the spot in 1795. In
the neighbourhood is the church of Sainte Anne d'Auray, one of the
principal places of pilgrimage in Brittany. Auray is one of the chief
centres in France for oyster-breeding, and carries on boat-building and
sardine-fishing.
