AUBADE (a French word from _aube_, the dawn), the dawn-song of the
troubadours of Provence, developed by the Minnesingers (q.v.) of Germany
into the _Tagelied_, the song of the parting at dawn of lovers at the
warning of the watchman. In France in modern times the term is applied
to the performance of a military band in the early morning in honour of
some distinguished person.
