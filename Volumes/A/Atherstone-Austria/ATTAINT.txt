ATTAINT, WRIT OF, an obsolete method of procedure in English law, for
inquiring by a jury of twenty-four whether a false verdict had been
given in a trial before an ordinary jury of twelve. If it were found
that an erroneous judgment had been given, the wrong was redressed and
the original jury incurred infamy, with imprisonment and forfeiture of
their goods, which punishments were, however, commuted later for a
pecuniary penalty. In criminal cases a writ of attaint was issued at
suit of the king, and in civil cases at the suit of either party. In
criminal cases it appears to have become obsolete by the end of the 15th
century. Procedure by attaint in civil cases had also been gradually
giving place to the practice of granting new trials, and after the
decision in Bushell's case in 1670 (see JURY) it became obsolete, and
was finally abolished by the Juries Act 1825, except as regards jurors
guilty of embracery (q.v.).
