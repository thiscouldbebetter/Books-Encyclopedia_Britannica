AUDEFROI LE BATARD, French _trouvère_, flourished at the end of the 12th
century and was born at Arras. Of his life nothing is known. The
seigneur de Nesles, to whom some of his songs are addressed, is probably
the châtelain of Bruges who joined the crusade of 1200. Audefroi was the
author of at least five lyric romances: _Argentine, Belle Idoine, Belle
Isabeau, Belle Emmelos_ and _Béatrix_. These romances follow older
_chansons_ in subject, but the smoothness of the verse and beauty of
detail hardly compensate for the spontaneity of the shorter form.

  âge_ (Paris, 1889).
