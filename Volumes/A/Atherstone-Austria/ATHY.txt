ATHY (pronounced Athý), a market-town of Co. Kildare, Ireland, in the
south parliamentary division, 45 m. S.W. of Dublin on a branch of the
Great Southern & Western railway. Pop. of urban district (1901) 3599. It
is intersected by the river Barrow, which is here crossed by a bridge of
five arches. The crossing of the river here was guarded and disputed
from the earliest times, and the name of the town is derived from a king
of Munster killed here in the 2nd century. There are picturesque remains
of Woodstock Castle of the 12th or 13th century, and White Castle built
in 1506, and rebuilt in 1575 by a member of the family whose name it
bears, and still occupied. Both were erected to defend the ford of the
Barrow. There are also an old town gate, and an ancient cemetery with
slight monastic remains. Previous to the Union Athy returned two members
to the Irish parliament. The trade, chiefly in grain, is aided by
excellent water communication, by a branch of the Grand Canal to Dublin,
and by the river Barrow, navigable from here to Waterford harbour.
