peninsula between two bays, near the modern village of Vathy, about 3 m.
S. of Chalcis. Its fame was due to the tradition that it was the
starting-place of the Greek fleet before the Trojan War, the scene of
the sacrifice of Iphigenia. The temple of Artemis was still to be seen
in the time of Pausanias.
