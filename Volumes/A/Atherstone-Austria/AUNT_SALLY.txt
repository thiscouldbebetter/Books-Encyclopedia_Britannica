AUNT SALLY, the English name for a game popular at fairs, race-courses
and summer resorts. It consists in throwing hard balls, of wood or
leather-covered yarn, at puppets dressed to represent different
characters, originally a grotesque female figure called "Aunt Sally,"
with the object of smashing a clay pipe which is inserted either in the
mouth or forehead of the puppet. In France the game is popular under the
name _jeu de massacre_. In a variation of the pastime the mark consists
of a living person's head thrust through a hole in a sheet of canvas. In
case of a hit a second shy is allowed, or a small prize is given.
