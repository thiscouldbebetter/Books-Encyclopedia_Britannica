AUGUSTA BAGIENNORUM, the chief town of the Ligurian tribe of the
Bagienni, probably identical with the modern Bene Vagienna, on the upper
course of the Tanaro, about 35 m. due south of Turin. The town retained
its position as a tribal centre in the reorganization of Augustus, whose
name it bears, and was erected on a systematic plan. Considerable
remains of public buildings, constructed in concrete faced with small
stones with bands of brick at intervals, an amphitheatre with a major
axis of 390 ft. and a minor axis of 305 ft., a theatre with a stage 133
ft. in length, and near it the foundations of what was probably a
basilica, an open space (no doubt the forum), an aqueduct, baths, &c.,
have been discovered by recent excavations, and also one of the city
gates, flanked by two towers 22 ft. sq.
