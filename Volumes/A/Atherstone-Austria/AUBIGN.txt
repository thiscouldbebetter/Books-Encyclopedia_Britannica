AUBIGNÉ, CONSTANT D' [BARON DE SURINEAU] (c. 1584-1647), French
adventurer, was the son of Théodore Agrippa d'Aubigné, and the father of
Madame de Maintenon. Born a Protestant, he became by turns Catholic or
Protestant as it suited his interests. He betrayed the Protestants in
1626, revealing to the court, after a voyage to England, the projects of
the English upon La Rochelle. He was renounced by his father; then
imprisoned by Richelieu's orders at Niort, where he was detained ten
years. After having tried his fortunes in the Antilles, he died in
Provence, leaving in destitution his wife, Jeanne de Cardillac, whom he
had married in 1627. He had two children, Charles, father of the duchess
of Noailles, and Françoise, known in history as Madame de Maintenon.
