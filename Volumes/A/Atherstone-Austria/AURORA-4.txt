AURORA, a village of Cayuga county, New York, U.S.A., on Cayuga Lake, 16
m. S.W. of Auburn. Pop. (1905) 623; (1910) 493. It is served by the
Lehigh Valley railway. Aurora is a beautiful place and a popular summer
resort, but it is best known as the seat of Wells College, a
non-sectarian college for women, founded in 1868 by Henry Wells
(1805-1878), of the Wells Fargo Express Company, and liberally endowed
by Edwin B. Morgan (1806-1881), also connected with the same company,
and by others. At Aurora are also the Somes school (a preparatory school
for boys), founded in 1798 and until 1904 known as the Cayuga Lake
Academy, and the Wells school (a preparatory school for girls). The
village has a public library. Aurora was settled in 1789 chiefly by
residents of New England, and was incorporated in 1905.
