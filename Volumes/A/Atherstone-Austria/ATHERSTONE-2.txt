ATHERSTONE, a market-town in the Nuneaton parliamentary division of
Warwickshire, England, 102½ m. N.W. from London by the London &
North-Western railway. Pop. (1901) 5248. It lies in the upper valley of
the Anker, under well-wooded hills to the west, and is on the Roman
Watling Street, and the Coventry canal. The once monastic church of St
Mary is rebuilt, excepting the central tower and part of the chancel.
The chief industry is hat-making. On the high ground to the west lie
ruins of the Cistercian abbey of Merevale, founded in 1149; they include
the gatehouse chapel, part of the refectory and other remains exhibiting
beautiful details of the 14th century. Coal is worked at Baxterley, 3 m.
west of Atherstone.

  Atherstone (_Aderestone, Edridestone, Edrichestone_), though not
  mentioned in any pre-Conquest record, is of unquestionably ancient
  origin. A Saxon barrow was opened near the town in 1824. It is
  traversed by Watling Street, and portions of the ancient Roman road
  have been discovered in modern times. Atherstone is mentioned in
  Domesday among the possessions of Countess Godiva, the widow of
  Leofric. In the reign of Henry III. it passed to the monks of Bec in
  Normandy, who in 1246 obtained the grant of an annual fair at the
  feast of the Nativity of the Virgin, and the next year of a market
  every Tuesday. This market became so much frequented that in 1319 a
  toll was levied upon all goods coming into the town, in order to
  defray the cost of the repair to the roads necessitated by the
  constant traffic, and in 1332 a similar toll was levied on all goods
  passing over the bridge called Feldenbrigge near Atherstone. The
  September fair and Tuesday markets are still continued. In the reign
  of Edward III. a house of Austin Friars was founded at Atherstone by
  Ralph Lord Basset of Drayton, which, however, never rose to much
  importance, and at its dissolution in 1536 was valued at 30 shillings
  and 3 pence only.
