AUDE, a river of south-western France, rising in the eastern Pyrenees
and flowing into the Golfe du Lion. Rising in a small lake a short
distance east of the Puy de Carlitte, it soon takes a northerly
direction and flows for many miles through deep gorges of great beauty
as far as the plain of Axat. Beyond Axat its course again lies through
defiles which become less profound as the river nears Carcassonne. Below
that town it receives the waters of the Fresquel and turns abruptly
east. From this point to its junction with the Cesse its course is
parallel with that of the Canal du Midi. The river skirts the northern
spurs of the Corbières, some distance below which it is joined by the
Orbieu and the Cesse. It then divides into two branches, the
northernmost of which, the Aude proper, runs east and empties into the
Mediterranean some 12 m. east-north-east of Narbonne, while the other
branch, the Canal de la Robine, turning south, traverses that town,
below which its course to the sea lies between two extensive lagoons,
the Étang de Bages et de Sigean and the Étang de Gruissan. The Aude has
a length of 140 m. and a basin 2061 sq. m. in extent. There is
practically no traffic upon it.
