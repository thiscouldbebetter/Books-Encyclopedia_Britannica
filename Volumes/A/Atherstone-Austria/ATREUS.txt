ATREUS, in Greek legend, son of Pelops and Hippodameia, and elder
brother of Thyestes. Having murdered his stepbrother Chrysippus, Atreus
fled with Thyestes to Mycenae, where he succeeded Eurystheus in the
sovereignty. His wife Aërope was seduced by Thyestes, who was driven
from Mycenae. To avenge himself, Thyestes sent Pleisthenes (Atreus' son
whom Thyestes had brought up as his own) to kill Atreus, but Pleisthenes
was himself slain by his own father. After this Atreus, apparently
reconciled to his brother, recalled him to Mycenae and invited him to a
banquet to eat of his son, whom Atreus had slain. Thyestes fled in
horror. Subsequently Atreus married the daughter of Thyestes, Pelopia,
who had by her own father a son, Aegisthus, who was adopted by Atreus.
Thyestes was found by Agamemnon and Menelaus, the sons of Atreus, and
imprisoned at Mycenae. Aegisthus being sent to murder Thyestes, mutual
recognition took place, and Atreus was slain by the father and son, who
seized the throne, and drove Agamemnon and Menelaus out of the country
(Thucydides i. 9; Hyginus, _Fabulae_; Apollodorus). Homer does not speak
of the horrors of the story, which are first found in the tragedians; he
merely states (_Iliad_, ii. 105) that Atreus at his death left the
kingdom to Thyestes.
