AUGUSTA, a seaport of the province of Syracuse, Sicily, 19 m. N. of it
by rail. Pop. (1901) 16,402. It occupies a part of the former peninsula
of Xiphonia, now a small island, connected with the mainland by a
bridge. It was founded by the emperor Frederick II. in 1232, and almost
entirely destroyed by an earthquake in 1693, after which it was rebuilt.
The castle is now a large prison. The fortified port, though
unfrequented except as a naval harbour of refuge, is a very fine one.
There are considerable saltworks at Augusta. To the south, on the left
bank of the Molinello. 1½ m. from its mouth, Sicel tombs and Christian
catacombs, and farther up the river a cave village of the early middle
ages, have been explored (_Notizie degli Scavi_, 1902, 411, 631;
_Römische Quartalschrift_, 1902, 205). Whether there was ever a town
bearing the name Xiphonia is doubted by E.A. Freeman (_Hist. of Sic._ i.
583); cf., however, E. Pais, _Atakta_ (Pisa, 1891), 55, who attributes
its foundation, under the name of Tauromenion (which it soon lost), to
the Zancleans of Hybla (afterwards Megara Hyblaea).     (T. As.)
