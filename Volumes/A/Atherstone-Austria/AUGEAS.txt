AUGEAS, or AUGEIAS, in Greek legend, a son of Helios, the sun-god, and
king of the Epeians in Elis. He possessed an immense wealth of herds,
including twelve bulls sacred to Helios, and white as swans. Eurystheus
imposed upon Heracles the task of clearing out all his stalls unaided in
one day. This he did by turning the rivers Alpheus and Peneus through
them. Augeas had promised him a tenth of the herd, but refused this,
alleging that Heracles had acted only in the service of Eurystheus.
Heracles thereupon sent an army against him, and, though at first
defeated, finally slew Augeas and his sons.
