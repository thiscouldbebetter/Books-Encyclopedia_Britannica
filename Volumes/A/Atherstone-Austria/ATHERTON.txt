ATHERTON, or CHOWBENT, an urban district in the Leigh parliamentary
division of Lancashire, England, 13 m. W.N.W. of Manchester on the
London & North-Western and Lancashire & Yorkshire railways. Pop. (1901)
16,211. The cotton factories are the principal source of industry; there
are also iron-works and collieries. The manor was held by the local
family of Atherton from John's reign to 1738, when it passed by marriage
to Robert Gwillym, who assumed that name. In 1797 his eldest daughter
and co-heiress married Thomas Powys, afterwards the second Lord Lilford.
Up to 1891 the lord of the manor held a court-leet and court-baron
annually in November, but in that year Lord Lilford sold to the local
board the market tolls, stallages and pickages, and since this sale the
courts have lapsed. The earliest manufactures were iron and cotton.
Silk-weaving, formerly an extensive industry, has now almost entirely
decayed. The first chapel or church was built in 1645. James Wood, who
became Nonconformist minister in the chapel at Atherton in 1691, earned
fame and the familiar title of "General" by raising a force from his
congregation, uncouthly armed, to fight against the troops of the
Pretender (1715).
