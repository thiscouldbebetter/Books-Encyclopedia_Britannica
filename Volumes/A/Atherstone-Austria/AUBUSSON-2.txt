AUBUSSON, a town of France, capital of an arrondissement in the
department of Creuse, picturesquely situated on the river Creuse 24 m.
S.E. of Guéret by rail. Pop. (1906) 6475. It has celebrated
manufactories of carpets, &c., employing about 2000 workmen, the
artistic standard of which is maintained by a national school of
decorative arts, founded in 1869. Nothing certain is known as to the
foundation of this industry, but it was in full activity at least as far
back as 1531. From the 10th to the 13th century Aubusson was the centre
of a viscounty, and the viscountess Marguerite, wife of Rainaud VI., was
sung by many a troubadour. After the death of the viscount Guy II. (a
little later than 1262) Aubusson was incorporated in the countship of La
Marche by Hugh XII. of Lusignan, and shared in its fortunes. Louis XIV.
revived the title of viscount of Aubusson in favour of François, first
marshall de la Feuillade (1686). From the family of the old viscounts
was descended Pierre d'Aubusson (q.v.). Admiral Sallandrouze de
Lamornaix (1840-1902) belonged to a family of tapestry manufacturers
established at Aubusson since the beginning of the 19th century.
Aubusson was also the native place of the novelists Leonard Sylvain,
Julien Sandeau and Alfred Assollant (1827-1886).
