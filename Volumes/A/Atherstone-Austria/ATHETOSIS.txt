ATHETOSIS (Gr. [Greek: hathetos], "without place"), the medical term
applied to certain slow, purposeless, deliberate movements of the hands
and feet. The fingers are separately flexed and extended, abducted and
adducted in an entirely irregular way. The hands as a whole are also
moved, and the arms, toes and feet may be affected. The condition is
usually due to some lesion of the brain which has caused hemiplegia, and
is especially common in childhood. It is occasionally congenital (so
called), and is then due to some injury of the brain during birth. It is
more usually associated with hemiplegia, in which condition there is
first of all complete voluntary immobility of the parts affected: but
later, as there is a return of a certain amount of power over the limbs
affected, the slow rhythmic movements of athetosis are first noticed.
This never develops, however, where there is no recovery of voluntary
power. Its distribution is thus nearly always hemiplegic, and it is
often associated with more or less mental impairment. The movements may
or may not continue during sleep. They cannot be arrested for more than
a moment by will power, and are aggravated by voluntary movements. The
prognosis is unsatisfactory, as the condition usually continues
unchanged for years, though improvement occasionally occurs in slight
cases, or even complete recovery.
