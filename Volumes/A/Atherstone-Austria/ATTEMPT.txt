ATTEMPT (Lat. _adtemptare, attentare_, to try), in law, an act done with
intent to commit a crime, and forming one of a series of acts which
would constitute its actual commission if it were not interrupted. An
attempt must proceed beyond mere preparation, but at the same time it
must fall short of the ultimate purpose in any part of it. The actual
point, however, at which an act ceases to be an attempt, and becomes
criminal, depends upon the circumstances of each particular case. A
person may be guilty of an attempt to commit a crime, even if its
commission in the manner proposed was impossible. Every attempt to
commit a treason, felony or indictable misdemeanour is in itself an
indictable misdemeanour, punishable by fine or imprisonment, unless the
attempt to commit is specifically punishable by statute as a felony, or
in a defined manner as a misdemeanour; and a person who has been
indicted for a felony or misdemeanour may, if the evidence so warrants,
be found guilty only of the attempt, provided that it too is a
misdemeanour.
