ATTAR [or OTTO] OF ROSES (Pers. _'atar_, essence), a perfume consisting
of essential oil of roses, prepared by distilling, or, in some
districts, by macerating the flowers. The manufacture is chiefly carried
out in India, Persia and the Balkans; the last named supplying the bulk
of the European demand. It is used by perfumery manufacturers as an
ingredient. The genuine attar of roses is costly and it is frequently
adulterated.
