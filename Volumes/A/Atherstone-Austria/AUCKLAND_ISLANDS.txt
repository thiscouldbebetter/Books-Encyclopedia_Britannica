AUCKLAND ISLANDS, a group in the Pacific Ocean, discovered in 1806 by
Captain Briscoe, of the English whaler "Ocean," in 50° 24' S., 166° 7'
E. The islands, of volcanic origin, are very fertile, and are covered
with forest. They were granted to the Messrs Enderby by the British
government as a whaling station, but the establishment was abandoned in
1852. The islands belong politically to New Zealand.
