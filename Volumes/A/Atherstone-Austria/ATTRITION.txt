ATTRITION (Lat. _attritio_, formed from _atterere_, to rub away), a
rubbing away; a term used in pathology and geology. Theologians have
also distinguished "attrition" from "contrition" in the matter of sin,
as an imperfect stage in the process of repentance; attrition being due
to servile fear of the consequences of sin, contrition to filial fear of
God and hatred of sin for His sake. It has been held among the Roman
Catholics that in the sacrament of penance attrition becomes contrition.
