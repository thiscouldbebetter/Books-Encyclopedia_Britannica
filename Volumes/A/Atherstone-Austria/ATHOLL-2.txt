ATHOLL, or ATHOLE, a district in the north of Perthshire, Scotland,
covering an area of about 450 sq. m. It is bounded on the N. by
Badenoch, on the N.E. by Braemar, on the E. by Forfarshire, on the S. by
Breadalbane, on the W. and N.W. by Lochaber. The Highland railway
bisects it diagonally from Dunkeld to the borders of Inverness-shire. It
is traversed by the Grampian mountains and watered by the Tay, Tummel,
Garry, Tilt, Bruar and other streams. Glen Garry and Glen Tilt are the
chief glens, and Loch Rannoch and Loch Tummel the principal lakes. The
population mainly centres around Dunkeld, Pitlochry and Blair Atholl.
The only cultivable soil occurs in the valleys of the large rivers, but
the deer-forest and the shootings on moor and mountain are among the
most extensive in Scotland. It is said to have been named Athfotla
(Atholl) after Fotla, son of the Pictish king Cruithne, and was under
the rule of a Celtic _mormaer_ (thane or earl) until the union of the
Picts and Scots under Kenneth Macalpine in 843. The duke of Atholl's
seats are Blair Castle and Dunkeld House. What is called Atholl brose is
a compound, in equal parts, of whisky and honey (or oatmeal), which was
first commonly used in the district for hoarseness and sore throat.
