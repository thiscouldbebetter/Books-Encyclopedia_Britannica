ATTORNMENT (from Fr. _tourner_, to turn), in English real property law,
the acknowledgment of a new lord by the tenant on the alienation of
land. Under the feudal system, the relations of landlord and tenant were
to a certain extent reciprocal. So it was considered unreasonable to the
tenant to subject him to a new lord without his own approval, and it
thus came about that alienation could not take place without the consent
of the tenant. Attornment was also extended to all cases of lessees for
life or for years. The necessity for attornment was abolished by an act
of 1705. The term is now used to indicate an acknowledgment of the
existence of the relationship of landlord and tenant. An
attornment-clause, in mortgages, is a clause whereby the mortgagor
attorns tenant to the mortgagee, thus giving the mortgagee the right to
distrain, as an additional security.
