AUBERGINE (diminutive of Fr. _auberge_, a variant of _alberge_, a kind
of peach), or EGG PLANT (_Solanum melongena_, var. _ovigerum_), a tender
annual widely cultivated in the warmer parts of the earth, and in France
and Italy, for the sake of its fruits, which are eaten as a vegetable.
The seed should be sown early in February in a warm pit, where the
plants are grown till shifted into 8-in. or 10-in. pots, in well-manured
soil. Liquid manure should be given occasionally while the fruit is
swelling; about four fruits are sufficient for one plant. The French
growers sow them in a brisk heat in December, or early in January, and
in March plant them out four or eight in a hot-bed with a bottom heat of
from 60° to 68°, the sashes being gradually more widely opened as the
season advances, until at about the end of May they may be taken off.
The two main branches which are allowed are pinched to induce laterals,
but when the fruits are set all young shoots are taken off in order to
increase their size. The best variety is the large purple, which
produces oblong fruit, sometimes reaching 6 or 7 in. in length and 10 or
12 in. in circumference. The fruit of the ordinary form almost exactly
resembles the egg of the domestic fowl. It is also grown as an
ornamental plant, for covering walls or trellises; especially the
black-fruited kind.
