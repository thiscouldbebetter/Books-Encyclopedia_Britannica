ATTALIA, an ancient city of Pamphylia, which derived its name from
Attalus II., king of Pergamum; the modern Adalia (q.v.). It was
important as the nearest seaport to the rich districts of south-west
Phrygia. A much-frequented "half-sea" route led through it to the Lycus
and Maeander valleys, and so to Ephesus and Smyrna. This was the natural
way from any part of central Asia Minor to Syria and Egypt, and
accordingly we hear of Paul and Barnabas taking ship at Attalia for
Antioch. Originally the port of Perga, Attalia eclipsed the old
Pamphylian capital in early Christian times and became the metropolis.
There are extensive remains of the ancient walls, including some
portions which go back to the foundation of the Pergamenian city. The
most conspicuous monument is the triple Gate of Hadrian, flanked by a
tower built by the empress Julia. This lies about half-way round the
_enceinte_ and formerly admitted the road from Perga.
