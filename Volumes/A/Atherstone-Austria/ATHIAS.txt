ATHIAS, JOSEPH (d. 1700), Jewish rabbi and printer, was born in Spain
and settled in Amsterdam. His editions of the Hebrew Bible (1661, 1667)
are noted for beauty of execution and the general correctness of the
text. He also printed a Judaeo-German edition of the Bible in 1679, a
year after the appearance of the edition by Uri Phoebus.
