ATTESTATION (Lat. _adtestare, attestare_, to bear witness, _testis_, a
witness), the verification of a deed, will or other instrument by the
signature to it of a witness or witnesses, who endorse or subscribe
their names under a memorandum, to the effect that it was signed or
executed in their presence. The essence of attestation is to show that
at the execution of the document there was present some disinterested
person capable of giving evidence as to what took place. The clause at
the end of the instrument, immediately preceding the signatures of the
witnesses to the execution, and stating that they have witnessed it, is
known as the attestation clause. In Scots law, the corresponding clause
is called the testing-clause (see DEED; WILL OR TESTAMENT; WITNESS).
