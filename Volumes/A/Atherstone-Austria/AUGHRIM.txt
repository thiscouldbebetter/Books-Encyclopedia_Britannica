AUGHRIM, or AGHRIM, a small village in Co. Galway, Ireland, 4 m. W. by
S. of Ballinasloe. It is rendered memorable by the decisive victory
gained here on the 12th of July 1691 by the forces of William III. under
General Ginkel, over those of James II. under the French general St
Ruth, who fell in the fight. The Irish numbering 25,000, and strongly
posted behind marshy ground, at first maintained a vigorous resistance;
but Ginkel having penetrated their line of defence, and their general
being struck down by a cannon ball at this critical moment, they were at
length overcome and routed with terrible slaughter. The loss of the
English did not exceed 700 killed and 1000 wounded; while the Irish, in
their disastrous flight, lost about 7000 men, besides the whole material
of the army. This defeat rendered the adherents of James in Ireland
incapable of further efforts, and was speedily followed by the complete
submission of the country.
