ATTIC BASE, the term given in architecture to the base of the Roman
Ionic order, consisting of an upper and lower torus, separated by a
scotia (q.v.) and fillets. It was the favourite base of the Romans,
and was employed by them for columns of the Corinthian and Composite
orders, and in Byzantine and Romanesque work would seem to have been
generally adopted as a model.
