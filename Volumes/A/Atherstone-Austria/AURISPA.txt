AURISPA, GIOVANNI (c. 1370-1459), one of the learned Italians of the
15th century, who did so much to promote the revival of the study of
Greek in Italy, was born at Noto in Sicily. In 1418 he visited
Constantinople, where he remained for some years, perfecting his
knowledge of Greek and searching for ancient MSS. His efforts were
rewarded by the acquisition of some 250 MSS., with which he returned to
Venice. Here he is said to have been obliged to pawn his treasures for
50 gold florins to provide for his immediate wants. Cosimo de' Medici,
hearing of his embarrassment, redeemed the MSS. and summoned the owner
to Florence. In 1438, at the council of Basel, Aurispa attracted the
attention of Pope Eugenius IV., who made him his secretary; he held a
similar position under Nicholas V., who presented him to two lucrative
abbacies. He died at Ferrara. Considering his long life and reputation
Aurispa produced little: Latin translations of the commentary of
Hierocles on the golden verses of Pythagoras (1474) and of _Philisci
Consolatoria ad Ciceronem_ from Dio Cassius (not published till 1510);
and, according to Gesner, a translation of the works of Archimedes.
Aurispa's reputation rests upon the extensive collection of MSS. copied
and distributed by him, and his persistent efforts to revive and promote
the study of ancient literature.
