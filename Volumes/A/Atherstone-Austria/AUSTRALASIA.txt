AUSTRALASIA, a term used by English geographers in a sense nearly
synonymous with the Oceania of continental writers. It thus comprises
all the insular groups which extend almost continuously from the
south-eastern extremity of Asia to more than half-way across the
Pacific. Its chief divisions are Malaysia with the Philippines;
Australia with Tasmania and New Zealand; Melanesia, that is, New Guinea,
New Britain, New Ireland, Admiralty, the Solomons, New Hebrides, Santa
Cruz, Fiji, Loyalties and New Caledonia; Micronesia, that is, the
Ladrones, Pelew and Carolines, with the Marshall and Gilbert groups;
lastly, Polynesia, that is, Samoa, Tonga, Cook, Tahiti, the Marquesas,
Ellice, Hawaii and all intervening clusters. The term is so far
justified in that it harmonizes better than Oceania did with the names
of the other continents, and also embodies the two essential facts that
it is a south-eastern extension of Asia, and that its central and most
important division is the great island-continent of Australia. In a more
restricted sense the term Australasia corresponds to the large division
including Australia, Tasmania and New Zealand.
