AUDAEUS, or AUDIUS, a church reformer of the 4th century, by birth a
Mesopotamian. He suffered much persecution from the Syrian clergy for
his fearless censure of their irregular lives, and was expelled from the
church, thereupon establishing an episcopal monastic community. He was
afterwards banished into Scythia, where he worked successfully among the
Goths, not living to see the destruction of his labours by Athanaric.
The Audaeans celebrated the feast of Easter on the same day as the
Jewish Passover, and they were also charged with attributing to the
Deity a human shape, an opinion which they appear to have founded on
Genesis i. 26. Theodoret groundlessly accuses them of Manichean
tendencies.
