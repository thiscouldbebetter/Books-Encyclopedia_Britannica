AUBURN (from the Low Lat. _alburnus_, whitish, light-coloured),
ruddy-brown; the meaning has changed from the original one of
brownish-white or light yellow (_citrinus_, in _Promptorium
Parvulorum_), probably through the intensification of the idea of brown
caused by the early spelling "abron" or "abrown."
