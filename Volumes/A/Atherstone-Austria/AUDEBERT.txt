AUDEBERT, JEAN BAPTISTE (1759-1800), French artist and naturalist, was
born at Rochefort in 1759. He studied painting and drawing at Paris, and
gained considerable reputation as a miniature-painter. Employed in
preparing plates for the _Histoire des coléoptères_ of G.A. Olivier
(1756-1814), he acquired a taste for natural history. In 1800 appeared
his first original work, _L'Histoire naturelle des singes, des makis et
des galéopithèques_, illustrated by sixty-two folio plates, drawn and
engraved by himself. The colouring in these plates was unusually
beautiful, and was applied by a method devised by himself. Audebert died
in Paris in 1800, leaving complete materials for another great work,
_Histoire des colibris, des oiseaux-mouches, des jacamars et des
promérops_, which was published in 1802. Two hundred copies were printed
in folio, one hundred in large quarto, and fifteen were printed with the
whole text in letters of gold. Another work, left unfinished, was also
published after the author's death, _L'Histoire des grimpereaux et des
oiseaux de paradis_. The last two works also appeared together in two
volumes, _Oiseaux dorés ou à reflets métalliques_ (1802).
