AUCHTERMUCHTY (Gaelic, "the high ground of the wild sow"), a royal and
police burgh of Fifeshire, Scotland, built on an elevation about 9 m. W.
by S. of Cupar, with a station on a branch of the North British railway
from Ladybank to Mawcarse Junction. Pop. 1387. The rapid Loverspool Burn
divides the town. The principal industries include the weaving of linen
and damasks, bleaching, distilling and malting. John Glas, founder of
the sect known as Glassites or Sandemanians, was a native of the town. A
mile and a half to the south-west is the village of Strathmiglo (pop.
966), on the river Eden, with a linen factory and bleaching works.
