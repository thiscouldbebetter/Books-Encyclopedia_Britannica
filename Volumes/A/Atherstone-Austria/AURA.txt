AURA (from the Gr. for "breath" or "breeze"), a term used in old days to
denote a supposed ethereal emanation from a volatile substance; applied
later to the "electrical aura," or air-current caused by electrical
discharge; in epilepsy (q.v.) to one of its premonitory symptoms; and
in spiritualism to a mysterious light associated with the presence of
spirit-forms. See also AUREOLA.
