ATINA, the name of three ancient towns of Italy.

1. A town (mod. _Àtena_) of Lucania, upon the Via Popillia, 7 m. N. of
Tegianum, towards which an ancient road leads, in the valley of the
river now known as Diano. Its ancient importance is vouched for by its
walls of rough cyclopean work, which may have had a total extent of some
2 m. (see G. Patroni in _Notizie degli scavi_, 1897, 112; 1901, 498).
The date of these walls has not as yet been ascertained, recent
excavations, which led to the discovery of a few tombs in which the
earliest objects showing Greek influence may go back to the 7th century
B.C., not having produced any decisive evidence on the point. To the
Roman period belong the remains of an amphitheatre and numerous
inscriptions.

2. A town (mod. _Atina_) of the Volsci, 12 m. N. of Casinum, and about
14 m. E. of Arpinum, on a hill 1607 ft. above sea-level. The walls, of
carefully worked polygonal blocks of stone, are still preserved in
parts, and the modern town does not fill the whole area which they
enclose. Cicero speaks of it as a prosperous country town, which had not
as yet fallen into the hands of large proprietors; and inscriptions show
that under the empire it was still flourishing. One of these last is a
boundary stone relating to the assignation of lands in the time of the
Gracchi, of which six other examples have been found in Campania and
Lucania.

3. A town of the Veneti, mentioned by Pliny, _H.N._ iii. 131.
