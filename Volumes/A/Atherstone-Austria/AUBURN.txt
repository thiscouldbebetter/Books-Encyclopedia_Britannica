AUBURN, a city and the county-seat of Androscoggin county, Maine,
U.S.A., on the Androscoggin river, opposite Lewiston (with which it
practically forms an industrial unit), in the S.W. part of the state.
Pop. (1890) 11,250; (1900) 12,951, of whom 2076 were foreign-born;
(1910, census) 15,064. It is served by the Grand Trunk and the Maine
Central railways. The river furnishes abundant water-power, and the city
ranked fourth in the state as a manufacturing centre in 1905. Boots and
shoes are the principal products; in 1905 seven-tenths of the city's
wage-earners were engaged in their manufacture, and Auburn's output
($4,263,162 = 66.5% of the total factory product of the city) was
one-third of that of the whole state. Other manufactures are butter,
bread and other bakery products, cotton goods, furniture and leather.
The municipality owns and operates its waterworks. Auburn was first
settled in 1786, and was incorporated in 1842, but the present charter
dates only from 1869.
