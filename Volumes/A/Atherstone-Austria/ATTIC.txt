ATTIC (i.e. "in the Attic style"), an architectural term given to the
masonry rising above the main cornice of a building, the earliest
example known being that of the monument of Thrasyllus at Athens. It was
largely employed by the Romans, who in their arches of triumph utilized
it for inscriptions or for bas-relief sculpture. It was used also to
increase the height of enclosure walls such as those of the Forum of
Nerva. By the Italian revivalists it was utilized as a complete storey,
pierced with windows, as found in Palladio's work at Vicenza and in
Greenwich hospital. The largest attic in existence is that which
surmounts the entablature of St Peter's at Rome, which measures 39 ft.
in height. The term is also employed in modern terminology to designate
an upper storey in a roof, and the feature is sometimes introduced to
hide a roof behind.
