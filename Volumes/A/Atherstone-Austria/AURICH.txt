AURICH, a town of Germany, in the Prussian province of Hanover, chief
town of the district of East Friesland, on the Ems-Jade canal, 18 m.
N.W. from Emden by rail. Pop. (1900) 6013. It is built in the Dutch
style, and lies in a sandy but fertile plain, surrounded by pleasant
promenades which have taken the place of the old fortifications. It has
a palace, formerly the residence of the counts of East Friesland and now
used as government offices, a Roman Catholic and two Protestant
churches, a gymnasium, and four libraries. There are breweries and
small manufactories of paper and tobacco. Close by is the
_Upstallsboom_, the hill of oath and liberty, where every year at
Whitsuntide representatives of the seven Frisian coast lands assembled
to deliberate.
