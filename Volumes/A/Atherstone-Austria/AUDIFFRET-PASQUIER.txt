AUDIFFRET-PASQUIER, EDMÉ ARMAND GASTON, DUC D' (1823-1905), French
statesman, was the grand-nephew and adopted son of Baron Etienne Denis
Pasquier. He was created duke in 1844, and became auditor at the council
of state in 1846. After the revolution of 1848 he retired to private
life. Under the empire he was twice an unsuccessful candidate for the
legislature, but was elected in February 1871 to the National Assembly,
and became president of the right centre in 1873. After the fall of
Thiers, he directed the negotiations between the different royalist
parties to establish a king in France, but as he refused to give up the
tricolour for the flag of the old _régime_, the project failed. Yet he
retained the confidence of the chamber, and was its president in 1875
when the constitutional laws were being drawn up. Nominated senator
under the new constitution, he likewise was president of the senate from
March 1876 to 1879 when his party lost the majority. Henceforth he was
less prominent in politics. He was distinguished by his moderation and
uprightness; and he did his best to dissuade MacMahon from taking
violent advisers. In 1878 he was elected to the French Academy, but
never published anything.
