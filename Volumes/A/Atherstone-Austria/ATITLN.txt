ATITLÁN, or SANTIAGO DE ATITLÁN, a town in the department of Sololá,
Guatemala, on the southern shore of Lake Atitlán. Pop. (1905) about
9000, almost all Indians. Cotton-spinning is the chief industry. Lake
Atitlán is 24 m. long and 10 m. broad, with 64 m. circumference. It
occupies a crater more than 1000 ft. deep and about 4700 ft. above
sea-level. The peaks of the Guatemala Cordillera rise round it,
culminating near its southern end in the volcanoes of San Pedro (7000
ft.) and Atitlán (11,719 ft.). Although the lake is fed by many small
mountain torrents, it has no visible outlet, but probably communicates
by an underground channel with one of the rivers which drain the
Cordillera. Mineral springs abound in the neighbourhood. The town of
Sololá (q.v.) is near the north shore of the lake.
