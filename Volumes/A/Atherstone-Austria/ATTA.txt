ATTA, TITUS QUINCTIUS, or QUINTICIUS (d. 77 B.C.), Roman comedy writer,
was, like Titinius and Afranius, distinguished as a writer of _fabulae
togatae_, national comedies. He had the reputation of being a vivid
delineator of character, especially female. He also seems to have
published a collection of epigrams. The scanty fragments contain many
archaisms, but are lively in style. According to Horace (_Epistles_, ii
1. 79) the plays of Atta were still put on the stage in his time.

  Aulus Gellius vii. 9; fragments in Neukirch, _De fabula togata
  Romanorum_ (1833); Ribbeck, _Comicorum Latinorum reliquiae_ (1855).
