AUDOUIN, JEAN VICTOR (1797-1841), French naturalist, was born at Paris
on the 27th of April 1797. He began the study of law, but was diverted
from it by his strong predilection for natural history, and entered the
medical profession. In 1824 he was appointed assistant to P.A. Latreille
(1762-1833) in the entomological chair at the Paris museum of natural
history, and succeeded him in 1833. In 1838 he became a member of the
Academy of Sciences. He died in Paris on the 9th of November 1841. His
principal work, _Histoire des insectes nuisibles à la vigne_ (1842), was
completed after his death by Henry Milne-Edwards and Émile Blanchard.
His papers mostly appeared in the _Annales des sciences naturelles_,
which, with A.T. Brongniart and J.B.A. Dumas, he founded in 1824, and in
the proceedings of the Société Entomologique de France, of which he was
one of the founders in 1832.
