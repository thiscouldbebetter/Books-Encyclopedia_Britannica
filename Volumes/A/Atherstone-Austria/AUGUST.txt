AUGUST (originally _Sextilis_), the sixth month in the pre-Julian Roman
year, which received its present name from the emperor Augustus. The
preceding month, _Quintilis_, had been called "July" after Julius
Caesar, and the emperor chose August to be rechristened in his own
honour because his greatest good fortune had then happened. In that
month he had been admitted to the consulate, had thrice celebrated a
triumph, had received the allegiance of the soldiers stationed on the
Janiculum, had concluded the civil wars, and had subdued Egypt. As July
contained thirty-one days, and August only thirty, it was thought
necessary to add another day to the latter month, in order that the
month of Augustus might not be in any respect inferior to that of
Julius.
