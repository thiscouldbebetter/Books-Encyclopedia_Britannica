ATTHIS (an adjective meaning "Attic"), the name given to a monograph or
special treatise on the religious and political history, antiquities and
topography of Attica and Athens. During the 4th and 3rd centuries B.C.,
a class of writers arose, who, making these subjects their particular
study, were called atthidographi, or compilers of atthides. The first of
these was Clidemus or Clitodemus (about 378 B.C.); the last, Ister of
Cyrene (died 212 B.C.); the most important was Philochorus (first half
of the 3rd century B.C.), of whose work considerable fragments have been
preserved. The names of the other atthidographi known to us are
Phanodemus, Demon, Androtion, Andron, Melanthius. They laid no claim to
literary skill; their style was monotonous and soon became wearisome.
They were in fact chroniclers or annalists--not historians. Their only
object was to set down, in plain and simple language, all that seemed
worthy of note in reference to the legends, history, constitution,
religion and civilization of Attica. They followed the order of the
olympiads and archons, and their work was supported by the authority of
original documents, monuments and inscriptions. Their writings were much
used by historians, as well as by the scholiasts and grammarians.
