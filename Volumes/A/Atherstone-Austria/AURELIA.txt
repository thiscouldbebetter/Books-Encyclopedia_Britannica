AURELIA, VIA, an ancient highroad of Italy, the date of the construction
of which is unknown. It ran from Rome to Alsium, where it reached the
sea, and thence along the south-west coast of Italy, perhaps originally
only as far as Cosa, and was later extended to Vada Volaterrana, and in
109 B.C. to Genua and Dertona by means of the Via Aemilia, though a
coast road as far as Genua at least must have existed long before. The
name is applied in the Antonine Itinerary to these extensions, and even
to the prolongation to Aries. Its line is in the main closely followed
by the modern coast highroad; cf., however, for the section between Cosa
and Populonia, O. Cuntz in _Jahreshefte des Öslerr. arch. Instituts_,
