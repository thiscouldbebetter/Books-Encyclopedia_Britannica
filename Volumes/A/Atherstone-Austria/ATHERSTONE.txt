ATHERSTONE, WILLIAM GUYBON (1813-1898), British geologist, one of the
pioneers in South African geology, was born in 1813, in the district of
Uitenhage, Cape Colony. Having qualified as M.D. he settled in early
life as a medical practitioner at Grahamstown, subsequently becoming
F.R.C.S. In 1839 his interest was aroused in geology, and from that date
he "devoted the leisure of a long and successful medical practice" to
the pursuit of geological science. In 1857 he published an account of
the rocks and fossils of Uitenhage (the latter described more fully by
R. Tate, _Quart. Journal Geol. Soc._, 1867). He also obtained many
fossil reptilia from the Karroo beds, and presented specimens to the
British Museum. These were described by Sir Richard Owen. Atherstone's
identification in 1867 as a diamond of a crystal found at De Kalk near
the junction of the Riet and Vaal rivers, led indirectly to the
establishment of the great diamond industry of South Africa. He
encouraged the workings at Jagersfontein, and he also called attention
to the diamantiferous neck at Kimberley. He was one of the founders of
the Geological Society of South Africa at Johannesburg in 1895; and for
some years previously he was a member of the Cape parliament. He died at
Grahamstown, on the 26th of June 1898.
