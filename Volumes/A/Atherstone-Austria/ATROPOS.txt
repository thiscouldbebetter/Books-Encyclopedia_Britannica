ATROPOS, in Greek mythology, the eldest of the three Fates (see FATE).
Her name, the "Unalterable" ([Greek: a]- privative, and [Greek:
trepein], to turn), indicates her function, that of rendering the
decisions of her sisters irreversible or immutable. Atropos is most
frequently represented with scales, a sun-dial or a cutting instrument,
the "abhorred shears," with which she slits the thin-spun thread of life
that has been placed on the spindle by Clotho and drawn off by Lachesis.
