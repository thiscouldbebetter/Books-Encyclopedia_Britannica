AURILLAC, a town of central France, capital of the department of Cantal,
140 m. N.N.E. of Toulouse, on the Orléans railway between Figeac and
Murat. Pop. (1906) 14,097. Aurillac stands on the right bank of the
Jordanne, and is dominated from the north-west by the Roc Castanet,
crowned by the castle of St Etienne, the keep of which dates from the
11th century. Its streets are narrow and uninteresting, with the
exception of one which contains, among other old houses, that known as
the Maison des Consuls, a Gothic building of the 16th century, decorated
with sculptured stone-work. Aurillac owes its origin to an abbey founded
in the 9th century by St Géraud, and the abbey-church, rebuilt in the
17th century in the Gothic style, is the chief building in the town. The
former college, which dates from the 17th century, is now occupied by a
museum and a library. There is a statue of Pope Silvester II., born near
Aurillac in 930 and educated in the abbey, which soon afterwards became
one of the most famous schools of France. Aurillac is the seat of a
prefect, and its public institutions include tribunals of first instance
and of commerce, a chamber of commerce, a lycée, training-colleges and a
branch of the Bank of France. The chief manufactures are wooden shoes
and umbrellas, and there is trade in cheese and in the cattle and horses
reared in the neighbourhood.
