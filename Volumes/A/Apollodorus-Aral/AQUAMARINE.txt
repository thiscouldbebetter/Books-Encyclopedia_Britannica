AQUAMARINE (Lat. _aqua marina_, "water of the sea"), a transparent
variety of beryl (q.v.), having a delicate blue or bluish-green colour,
suggestive of the tint of sea-water. It occurs at most localities which
yield ordinary beryl, some of the finest coming from Russia. The
gem-gravels of Ceylon contain aquamarine. Clear yellow beryl, such as
occurs in Brazil, is sometimes called aquamarine chrysolite. When
corundum presents the bluish tint of typical aquamarine, it is often
termed Oriental aquamarine.
