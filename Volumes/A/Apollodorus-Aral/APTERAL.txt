APTERAL (from the Gr. [Greek: apteros], wingless, [Greek: a-], privative
and [Greek: pteros], a wing), an architectural term applied to
amphiprostyle temples which have no columns on the sides; in the Ionic
temple on the Acropolis at Athens known as Nike Apteros, the adjective
is used, not as applying to the goddess of victory but to the absence of
any peristyle on the sides.
