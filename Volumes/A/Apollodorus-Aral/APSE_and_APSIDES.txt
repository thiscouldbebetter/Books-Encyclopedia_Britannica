APSE and APSIDES, in mechanics, either of the two points of an orbit
which are nearest to and farthest from the centre of motion. They are
called the lower or nearer, and the higher or more distant apsides
respectively. The "line of apsides" is that which joins them, forming
the major axis of the orbit.
