AQUILA [Greek: Akulas], (1) a Jew from Rome, who with his wife Prisca or
Priscilla had settled in Corinth, where Paul stayed with them (Acts
xviii. 2,3). They became Christians and fellow-workers with Paul, to
whom they seem to have shown their devotion in some special way (Rom.
xvi. 3, 4). (2) A native of Pontus, celebrated for a very literal and
accurate translation of the Old Testament into Greek. Epiphanius (_De
Pond. et Mens._ c. 15) preserves a tradition that he was a kinsman of
the emperor Hadrian, who employed him in rebuilding Jerusalem (Aelia
Capitolina, q.v.), and that he was converted to Christianity, but, on
being reproved for practising pagan astrology, apostatized to Judaism.
He is said also to have been a disciple of Rabbi 'Aqiba (d. A.D. 132),
and seems to be referred to in Jewish writings as [Hebrew: akiles].
Aquila's version is said to have been used in place of the Septuagint in
the synagogues. The Christians generally disliked it, alleging without
due grounds that it rendered the Messianic passages incorrectly, but
Jerome and Origen speak in its praise. Origen incorporated it in his
_Hexapla_.

  It was thought that this was the only copy extant, but in 1897
  fragments of two codices were brought to the Cambridge University
  Library. These have been published--the fragments containing 1 Kings
  xx. 7-17; 2 Kings xxiii. 12-27 by F.C. Burkitt in 1897, those
  containing parts of Psalms xc.-ciii. by C. Taylor in 1899. See F.C.
  Burkitt's article in the _Jewish Encyclopaedia_.
