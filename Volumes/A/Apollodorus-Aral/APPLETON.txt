APPLETON, NATHAN (1770-1861) American merchant and politician, was born
in New Ipswich, New Hampshire, on the 6th of October 1779. He was
educated in the New Ipswich Academy, and in 1794 entered mercantile life
in Boston, in the employment of his brother, Samuel (1766-1853), a
successful and benevolent man of business, with whom he was in
partnership from 1800 to 1809. He co-operated with Francis C. Lowell
and others in introducing the power-loom and the manufacture of cotton
on a large scale into the United States, a factory being established at
Waltham, Massachusetts, in 1814, and another in 1822 at Lowell,
Massachusetts, of which city he was one of the founders. He was a member
of the general court of Massachusetts in 1816, 1821, 1822, 1824 and
1827, and in 1831-1833 and 1842 of the national House of
Representatives, in which he was prominent as an advocate of protective
duties. He died in Boston on the 14th of July 1861.

His son, THOMAS GOLD APPLETON (1812-1884), who graduated at Harvard in
1831, had some reputation as a writer, an artist and a patron of the
fine arts, but was better known for his witticisms, one of which, the
oft-quoted "Good Americans, when they die, go to Paris," is sometimes
attributed to Oliver Wendell Holmes. He published some poems and, in
prose, _Nile Journal_ (1876), _Syrian Sunshine_ (1877), _Windfalls_
(1878), and _Chequer-Work_ (1879).
