APPENDINI, FRANCESCO MARIA (1768-1837), Italian historian and
philologist, was born at Poirino, near Turin, on the 4th of November
1768. Educated at Rome, he took orders and was sent to Ragusa, where he
was appointed professor of rhetoric. When the French seized Ragusa,
Napoleon placed Appendini at the head of the Ragusan academy. After the
Austrian occupation he was appointed principal of a college at Zara,
where he died in 1837. Appendini's chief work was his _Notizie
Istorico-critiche sulle Antichità, Storia, e Letteratura dei Ragusci_
(1802-1803).
