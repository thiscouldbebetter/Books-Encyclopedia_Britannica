AQUATINT (Lat. _aqua_, water, and _tincta_, dyed), a kind of etching
(q.v.) which imitates washes with a brush. There are many ways of
preparing a plate for aquatint, the following being recommended by P.G.
Hamerton. Have three different solutions of rosin in rectified alcohol,
making them of various degrees of strength, but always thin enough to be
quite fluid, the weakest solution being almost colourless. First pour
the strongest solution on the plate. When it dries it will produce a
granulation; and you may now bite as in ordinary etching for your darker
tones, stopping out what the acid is not to operate upon, or you may use
a brush charged with acid, perchloride of iron being a very good mordant
for the purpose. After cleaning the plate, you proceed with the weaker
solutions in the same way, the weakest giving the finest granulation for
skies, distances, &c. The process requires a good deal of stopping-out,
and some burnishing, scraping, &c., at last. Aquatint may be effectively
used in combination with line etching, and still more harmoniously with
soft ground etching in which the line imitates that of the lead pencil.
