APPERT, BENJAMIN NICOLAS MARIE (1797-1847), French philanthropist, was
born in Paris on the 10th of September 1797. While a young man he
introduced a system of mutual instruction into the regimental schools of
the department of the Nord. The success which it obtained induced him to
publish a _Manual_ setting forth his system. While engaged in teaching
prisoners at Montaigu, he fell under the suspicion of having connived at
the escape of two of them, and was thrown into the prison of La Force.
On his release he resolved to devote the rest of his life to bettering
the condition of those whose lot he had for a time shared, and he
travelled much over Europe for the purpose of studying the various
systems of prison discipline, and wrote several books on the subject.
After the revolution of 1830 he became secretary to Queen Marie Amélie,
and organized the measures taken for the relief of the needy. He was
decorated with the Legion of Honour in 1833.

His brother, FRANÇOIS APPERT (d. 1840), was the inventor of the method
of preserving food by enclosing it in hermetically sealed tins; he left
a work entitled _Art de conserver les substances animales et
végétables_.
