ARACHNIDA, the zoological name given in 1815 by Lamarck (Gr. [Greek:
harachnae], a spider) to a class which he instituted for the reception
of the spiders, scorpions and mites, previously classified by Linnaeus
in the order Aptera of his great group Insecta. Lamarck at the same time
founded the class Crustacea for the lobsters, crabs and water-fleas,
also until then included in the order Aptera of Linnaeus. Lamarck
included the Thysanura and the Myriapoda in his class Arachnida. The
Insecta of Linnaeus was a group exactly equivalent to the Arthropoda
founded a hundred years later by Siebold and Stannius. It was thus
reduced by Lamarck in area, and made to comprise only the six-legged,
wing-bearing "Insecta." For these Lamarck proposed the name Hexapoda;
but that name has been little used, and they have retained to this day
the title of the much larger Linnaean group, viz. Insecta. The position
of the Arachnida in the great sub-phylum Arthropoda, according to recent
anatomical and embryological researches, is explained in the article
