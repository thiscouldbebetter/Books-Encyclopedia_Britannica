APPIAN (Gr. [Greek: Appianos]), of Alexandria, Roman historian,
flourished during the reigns of Trajan, Hadrian and Antoninus Pius. He
tells us that, after having filled the chief offices in his native
place, he repaired to Rome, where he practised as an advocate. When
advanced in years, he obtained, by the good offices of his friend
Fronto, the dignity of imperial procurator--it is supposed in Egypt. His
work ([Greek: Rumaika]) in twenty-four books, written in Greek, is
rather a number of monographs than a connected history. It gives an
account of various peoples and countries from the earliest times down to
their incorporation into the Roman empire. Besides a preface, there are
extant eleven complete books and considerable fragments. In spite of its
unattractive style, the work is very valuable, especially for the period
of the civil wars.
