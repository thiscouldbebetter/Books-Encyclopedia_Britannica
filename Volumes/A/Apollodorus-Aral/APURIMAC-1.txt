APURIMAC, a river of central Peru, rising in the Laguna de Villafra in
the western Cordilleras, 7 m. from Caylloma, a village in the department
of Arequipa, and less than 100 m. from the Pacific coast. It flows first
north-easterly, then north-westerly past Cuzco to the mouth of the
Perené tributary, thence east and north to its junction with the Ucayali
at 10° 41' S. lat., and 73° 34' W. long. It is known as the Apurimac
only down to the mouth of the Mantaro tributary, 11° 45' S. lat. and
1325 ft. above sea-level. Thence to the mouth of the Perene (984 ft.) it
is known as the Ené, and from that point to its junction with the
Ucayali (859 ft.) as the Tambo.
