APURÉ, a river of western Venezuela, formed by the confluence of the
Sarare and Uribante at 6° 45' N. lat. and 71° W. long., and flowing
eastward across the Venezuelan _llanos_ to a junction with the Orinoco
at about 7° 40' N. lat. and 66° 45' W. long. Its drainage area includes
the slopes of both the Colombian and Venezuelan Andes. It has a sluggish
course across the _llanos_ for about 300 m., and is navigable throughout
its length. Its principal tributaries are the Caparro, Portuguesa and
Guarico on the north, and the Caucagua on the south. Its lateral
channels on the south mingle with those of the Arauca for many miles,
forming an extensive district subject to annual inundations.
