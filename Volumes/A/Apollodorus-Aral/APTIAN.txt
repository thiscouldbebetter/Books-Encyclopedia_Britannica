APTIAN (Fr. _Aptien_, from Apt in Vaucluse, France), in geology, the
term introduced in 1843 by A. d'Orbigny (_Pal. France Crét._ ii.) for
the upper stage of the Lower Cretaceous rocks. In England it comprises
the Lower Greensand and part of the Speeton beds; in France it is
divided into two sub-stages, the lower, "Bedoulian," of Bedoule in
Provence, with _Hoplites deshayesei_ and _Ancyloceras Matheroni_; and an
upper, "Gargasian," from Gargas near Apt, with _Hoplites furcatus_
(_Dufrenoyi_) and _Phylloceras Guettardi_. To this stage belong the
_Toucasia_ limestone and _Orbitolina_ marls of Spain; the
_Schrattenkalk_ (part) of the Alpine and Carpathian regions; and the
_Terebrirostra_ limestone of the same area. Parts of the Flysch of the
eastern Alps, the Biancone of Lombardy, and _argile scagliose_ of
Emilia, are of Aptian age; so also are the "Trinity Beds" of North
America. Deposits of bauxite occur in the Aptian hippurite limestone at
Les Baux near Aries, and in the Pyrenees. The Aptian rocks are generally
clays, marls and green glauconitic sands with occasional limestones.
