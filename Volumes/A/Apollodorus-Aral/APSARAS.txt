APSARAS, in Hindu mythology, a female spirit of the clouds and waters.
In the Rig-Veda there is one Apsaras, wife of Gandharva; in the later
scriptures there are many Apsaras who act as the handmaidens of Indra
and dance before his throne. They are able to change their form, and
specially rule over the fortunes of gaming. One of their duties is to
guide to paradise the heroes who fall in battle, whose wives they then
become. They are distinguished as _daivika_ ("divine") or _laukika_
("worldly").
