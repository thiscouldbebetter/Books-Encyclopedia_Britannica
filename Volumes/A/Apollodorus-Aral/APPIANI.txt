APPIANI, ANDREA (1754-1817), the best fresco painter of his age, was
born at Milan. He was made pensioned artist to the kingdom of Italy by
Napoleon, but lost his allowance after the events of 1814 and fell into
poverty. Correggio was his model, and his best pieces, which are in the
church of Santa Maria presso San Celso and the royal palace at Milan,
almost rival those of his great master. He also painted Napoleon and the
chief personages of his court. Among the most graceful of his
oil-paintings are his "Venus and Love," and "Rinaldo in the Garden of
Armida." He is known as "the elder," to distinguish him from his
great-nephew Andrea Appiani (1817-1865), an historical painter at Rome.
Other painters of the same name were Niccolo Appiani (fl. 1510) and
Francesco Appiani (1704-1792).
