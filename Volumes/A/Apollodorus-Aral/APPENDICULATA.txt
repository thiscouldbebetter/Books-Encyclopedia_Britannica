APPENDICULATA, a zoological name introduced by E. Ray Lankester (preface
to the English edition of C. Gegenbaur's _Comparative Anatomy_), and
employed by the same writer in the 9th edition of this encyclopaedia
(article "Zoology") to denote the eighth phylum, or major division, of
coelomate animals. The animals thus associated, the Rotifera, Chaetopoda
and Arthropoda, are composed of a larger or smaller number of hollow
rings, each ring possessing typically a pair of hollow lateral
appendages, moved by intrinsic muscles and penetrated by blood-spaces.
