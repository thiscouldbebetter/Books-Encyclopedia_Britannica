ARAGUA, one of the smaller states of Venezuela under the redivision of
1904, lying principally within the parallel ranges of the Venezuelan
Cordillera, and comprising some of the most fertile and healthful
valleys of the republic. It is bounded E. by the Federal District and
Maturin, S. by Guárico and W. by Zamora and Carabobo. Pop. (1905, est.)
152,364. Aragua has a short coast-line on the Caribbean west of the
Federal District, but has no port of consequence. Cattle, swine and
goats are raised, and the state produces coffee, sugar, cacao, beans,
cereals and cheese. The climate of the higher valleys is subtropical,
the mean annual temperature ranging from 74° to 80° F. The capital, La
Victoria (pop. 7800), is situated in the fertile Aragua valley, 1558 ft.
above sea-level and 36 m. south-west of Carácas. Other important towns
are Barbacoas (pop. 13,109) on the left bank of the Guarico in a highly
fertile region, Ciudad de Cura and Maracay (pop. 7500), 56 m.
west-south-west of Carácas near the north-east shore of Lake Valencia.
The last two towns are on the railway between Carácas and Valencia.
