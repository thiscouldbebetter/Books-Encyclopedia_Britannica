APRON (a corruption arising from a wrong division of "a napron" into "an
apron," from the Fr. _naperon, napperon_, a diminutive of _nappe_, Lat.
_mappa_, a napkin), an article of costume used to protect the front of
the clothes. It forms part of the ceremonial dress of Freemasons. The
"apron" worn by church dignitaries is a shortened cassock (q.v.). The
word has many technical uses, as for the protecting slope in front of
the sill of dock-gates, or at the foot of weirs.
