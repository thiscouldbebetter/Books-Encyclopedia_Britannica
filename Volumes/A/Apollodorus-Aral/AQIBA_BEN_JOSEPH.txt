'AQIBA BEN JOSEPH (c. 50-132), Jewish Palestinian rabbi, of the circle
known as _tana_ (q.v.). It is almost impossible to separate the true
from the false in the numerous traditions respecting his life. He became
the chief teacher in the rabbinical school of Jaffa, where, it is said,
he had 24,000 scholars. Whatever their number, it seems certain that
among them was the celebrated Rabbi Meir, and that through him and
others 'Aqiba exerted a great influence on the development of the
doctrines embodied in the Mishnah. He sided with Bar Cochebas in the
last Jewish revolt against Rome, recognized him as the Messiah, and
acted as his sword-bearer. Being taken prisoner by the Romans under
Julius Severus, he was flayed alive with circumstances of great cruelty,
and met his fate, according to tradition, with marvellous steadfastness
and composure. He is said by some to have been a hundred and twenty
years old at the time of his death. He is one of the ten Jewish martyrs
whose names occur in a penitential prayer still used in the synagogue
service. 'Aqiba was among the first to systematize the Jewish tradition,
and he paved the way for the compilation of the Mishnah. From his school
emanated the Greek translation of the scriptures by Aquila.
