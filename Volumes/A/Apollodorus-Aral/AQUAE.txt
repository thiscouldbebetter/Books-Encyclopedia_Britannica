AQUAE (Lat. for "waters"), a name given by the Romans to sites where
mineral springs issued from the earth. Over a hundred can be identified,
some declaring by their modern names their ancient use: Aix-les-Bains in
Savoy (_Aquae Sabaudicae_), Aix-en-Provence (_Aquae Sextiae_),
Aix-la-Chapelle or Aachen (_Aquae Grani_), &c. Only two occur in
Britain: _Aquae Sulis_--less correctly _Aquae Solis_--at Bath in
Somerset, which was famous, and Buxton (called _Aquae_ simply), which
seems to have been far less important. Aquae Sulis was occupied by the
Romans almost as soon as they entered the island in A.D. 43, and
flourished till the end of the Roman period. It was frequented by
soldiers quartered in Britain, by the Britons, and by visitors from
north Gaul, and its name was known in Italy, though patients probably
seldom travelled so far. Like most mineral springs known to the
ancients, it was under the protection of a local deity, the Celtic Sul,
whom the Romans equated with their Minerva. Stately remains of its baths
and temple have been found at various times, especially in 1790 and
1878-1895, and may still be seen there.
