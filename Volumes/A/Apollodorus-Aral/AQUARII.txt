AQUARII, a name given to the Christians who substituted water for wine
in the Eucharist. They were not a sect, for we find the practice widely
in vogue at an early time, even among the orthodox. In Greek they were
called _Hydroparastatae_, or those who offer water. Theodosius, in his
persecuting edict of 382, classes them as a special sect with the
Manicheans, who also eschewed wine. See EUCHARIST.
