ARAGUAYA, ARAGUAY or ARAGUIA, a river of Brazil and principal affluent
of the Tocantins, rising in the Serra do Cayapó, where it is known as
the Rio Grande, and flowing in a north by east direction to a junction
with the Tocantins at Sao Joao do Araguaya, or Sao Joao das Duas Barras.
Its upper course forms the boundary line between Goyaz and Matto Grosso.
The river divides into two branches at about 13° 20' S. lat., and unites
again at 10° 30', forming the large island of Santa Anna or Bananal. The
eastern branch, called the Furo, is the one used by boats, as the main
channel is obstructed by rapids. Its principal affluent is the Rio das
Mortes, which rises in the Serra de Sao Jeronymo, near Cuyabá, Matto
Grosso, and is utilized by boatmen going to Pará. Of other affluents,
the Bonito, Garças, Cristallino and Tapirapé on the west, and the
Pitombas, Claro, Vermelho, Tucupá and Chavante on the east, nothing
definite is known as the country is still largely unexplored. The
Araguaya has a course of 1080 m., considerable stretches of which are
navigable for small river steamers, but as the river below Santa Anna
Island is interrupted by reefs and rapids in two places--one having a
fall of 85 ft. in 18 m., and the other a fall of 50 ft. in 12 m.--it
affords no practicable outlet for the products of the state. It was
explored in part by Henri Coudreau in 1897.
