APPONYI, ALBERT, COUNT (1846-   ), Hungarian statesman, the most
distinguished member of an ancient noble family, dating back to the 13th
century, and son of the chancellor Gyorgy Apponyi (1808-1899) and the
accomplished and saintly Countess Julia Sztáray, was born at Pesth on
the 29th of May 1846. Educated at the Jesuit seminary at Kalksburg and
at the universities of Vienna and Pesth, a long foreign tour completed
his curriculum, and at Paris he made the acquaintance of Montalembert, a
kindred spirit, whose influence on the young Apponyi was permanent. He
entered parliament in 1872 as a liberal Catholic, attaching himself at
first to the Deák party; but the feudal and ultramontane traditions of
his family circle profoundly modified, though they could never destroy,
his popular ideals. On the break up of the Deák party he attached
himself to the conservative group which followed Baron Pál Senynyey
(1824-1888) and eventually became its leader. Until 1905 Count Albert
was constantly in opposition, but in May of that year he consented to
take office in the second Wekerle ministry. A lofty and magnetic orator,
his speeches were published at Budapest in 1896; and he is the author of
an interesting dissertation, _Esthetics and Politics, the Artist and the
Statesman_ (Hung.) (Budapest, 1895).
