APPOGGIATURA (from Ital. _appoggiare_, to lean upon), a musical term for
a melodic ornament, a grace-note prefixed to a principal note and
printed in small character. The effect is to suspend the principal note,
by taking away the time-value of the _appoggiatura_ prefixed to it.
There are two kinds, the long _appoggiatura_, now usually printed as
played, and the short, where the suspension of the principal note is
scarcely perceptible; this is often called _acciatura_, a word properly
applied to an ornament now obsolete, in which a principal note in a
melody is struck together with the note immediately below, the lower
note being at once released and the other held on.
