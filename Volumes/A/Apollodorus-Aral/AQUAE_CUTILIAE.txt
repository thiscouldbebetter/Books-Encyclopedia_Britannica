AQUAE CUTILIAE, a mineral spring in Italy, near the modern Cittaducale,
9 m. E. of Rieti. The lake near it was supposed by classical writers to
be the central point of Italy, and was renowned for its floating
islands, which, as in other cases, were formed from the partial
petrification of plants by the mineral substances contained in the
water. Considerable remains of baths may still be seen there--they were
apparently resorted to by both Vespasian and Titus in their last
illnesses, for both died there.
