APPRAISER (from Lat. _appretiare_, to value), one who sets a value upon
property, real or personal. In England the business of an appraiser is
usually combined with that of an auctioneer, while the word itself has
given place, to a great extent, to that of "valuer." (See the articles
AUCTIONS AND AUCTIONEERS, and VALUATION AND VALUERS.)

In the United States appraiser is a term often used to describe a person
specially appointed by a judicial or quasi-judicial authority to put a
valuation on property, e.g. on the items of an inventory of the estate
of a deceased person or on land taken for public purposes by the right
of eminent domain. Appraisers of imported goods and boards of general
appraisers have extensive functions in administering the customs laws of
the United States. Merchant appraisers are sometimes appointed
temporarily under the revenue laws to value where there is no resident
appraiser without holding the office of appraiser (U.S. Rev. Stats. §
2609).
