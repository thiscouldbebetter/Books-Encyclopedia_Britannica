ARRIA, in Roman history, the heroic wife of Caecina Paetus. When her
husband was implicated in the conspiracy of Scribonianus against the
emperor Claudius (A.D. 42), and condemned to death, she resolved not to
survive him. She accordingly stabbed herself with a dagger, which she
then handed to him with the words, "Paetus, it does not hurt" (_Paete,
non dolet_; see Pliny, _Epp._ iii. 16; Martial i. 14; Dio Cassius lx.
16). Her daughter, also called Arria, was the wife of Thrasea Paetus.
When he was condemned to death by Nero, she would have imitated her
mother's example, but was dissuaded by her husband, who entreated her to
live for the sake of their children. She was sent into banishment
(Tacitus, _Annals_, xvi. 34).
