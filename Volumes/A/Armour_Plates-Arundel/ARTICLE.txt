ARTICLE (from Lat. _articulus_, a joint), a term primarily for that
which connects two parts together, and so transferred to the parts thus
joined; thus the word is used of the separate clauses or heads in
contracts, treaties or statutes and the like; of a literary composition
on some specific subject in a periodical; or of particular commodities,
as in "articles of trade and commerce." It appears also in the phrase
"in the article of death" to translate _in articulo mortis_, at the
moment of death. In grammar the term is used of the adjectives which
state the extension of a substantive, i.e. the number of individuals to
which a name applies; the indefinite article denoting one or any of a
particular class, the definite denoting a particular member of a class.
