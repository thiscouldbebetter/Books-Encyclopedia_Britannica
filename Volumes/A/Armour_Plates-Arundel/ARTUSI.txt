ARTUSI, GIOVANNI MARIA, Italian composer and musical theorist, was born
in Bologna, and died on the 18th of August 1613. He was _canonico
regulare_ at the church of San Salvatore in his native city. He is
chiefly famous in the history of music for his attacks upon Monteverde
(q.v.) embodied in his _L'Artusi overo d. imp._ (1600). For an
exhaustive explanation and a translation of excerpts from these the
studies of Dr G. Vogel and O. Riemann should be consulted. These will be
found in the _Vierteljahrsschrift für Musikwissenschaft_, Leipzig, vol.
3, pp. 326, 380 and 426.
