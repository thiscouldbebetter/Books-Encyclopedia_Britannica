ARTAPHERNES, more correctly ARTAPHRENES, brother of Darius Hystaspis,
and satrap of Sardis. It was he who received the embassy from Athens
sent probably by Cleisthenes (q.v.) in 507 B.C., and subsequently warned
the Athenians to receive back the "tyrant" Hippias. Subsequently he took
an important part in suppressing the Ionian revolt (see IONIA,
ARISTAGORAS, HISTIAEUS), and after the war compelled the cities to make
agreements by which all differences were to be settled by reference. He
also measured out their territories in parasangs and assessed their
tributes accordingly (Herod, vi. 42). In 492 he was superseded in his
satrapy by Mardonius (Herodotus v. 25, 30-32, 35, &c.; Diod. Sic. x.
25). His son, of the same name, was appointed (490), together with
Datis, to take command of the expedition sent by Darius to punish Athens
and Eretria for their share in the Ionian revolt. After the defeat of
Marathon he returned to Asia. In the expedition of Xerxes, ten years
later, he was in command of the Lydians and Mysians (Herod, vi. 94, 119;
vii. 74, Aesch. _Persae_, 21).

Aeschylus in his list of Persian kings (_Persae_, 775 ff.), which is
quite unhistorical, mentions two kings with the name Artaphrenes, who
may have been developed out of these two Persian commanders. (Ed. M.)
