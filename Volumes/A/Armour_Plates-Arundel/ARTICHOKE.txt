ARTICHOKE. The common artichoke, _Cynara, scolymus_, is a plant
belonging to the natural order Compositae, having some resemblance to a
large thistle. It has long been esteemed as a culinary vegetable; the
parts chiefly employed being the immature receptacle or floret disk,
with the lower part of the surrounding leaf-scales, which are known as
"artichoke bottoms." In Italy the receptacles, dried, are largely used
in soups; those of the cultivated plant as _Carciofo domestico_, and of
the wild variety as _Carciofo spinoso_.

The Jerusalem artichoke, _Helianthus tuberosus_, is a distinct plant
belonging to the same order, cultivated for its tubers. It closely
resembles the sunflower, and its popular name is a corruption of the
Italian _Girasole Articiocco_, the sunflower artichoke. It is a native
of Canada and the north-eastern United States, and was cultivated by the
aborigines. The tubers are rich in the carbohydrate inulin and in sugar.

The name is derived from the northern Italian _articiocco_, or
_arciciocco_, modern _carciofo_; these words come, through the Spanish,
from the Arabic _al-kharshuf_. False etymology has corrupted the word in
many languages: it has been derived in English from "choke," and
"heart," or the Latin _hortus_, a garden; and in French, the form
_artichaut_ has been connected with _chaud_, hot, and _chou_, a cabbage.
