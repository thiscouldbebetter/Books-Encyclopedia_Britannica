ARTICULATION (from Lat. _articulare_, to divide into joints), the act of
joining together; in anatomy the junction of the bones (see JOINTS); in
botany the point of attachment and separation of the deciduous parts of
a plant, such as a leaf. The word is also used for division into
distinct parts, as of human speech by words or syllables.
