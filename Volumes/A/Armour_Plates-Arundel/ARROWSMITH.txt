ARROWSMITH, the name of an English family of geographers. The first of
them, Aaron Arrowsmith (1750-1823), migrated to London from Winston in
Durham when about twenty years of age, and was employed by John Gary,
the engraver. In 1790 he made himself famous by his large chart of the
world on Mercator's projection. Four years later he published another
large map of the world on the globular projection, with a companion
volume of explanation. The maps of North America (1796) and Scotland
(1807) are the most celebrated of his many later productions. He left
two sons, Aaron and Samuel, the elder of whom was the compiler of the
_Eton Comparative Atlas_, of a Biblical atlas, and of various manuals of
geography. They carried on the business in company with John Arrowsmith
(1790-1873), nephew of the elder Aaron. In 1834 John published his
_London Atlas_, the best set of maps then in existence. He followed up
the atlas with a long series of elaborate and carefully executed maps,
those of Australia, America, Africa and India being especially valuable.
In 1863 he received the gold medal of the Royal Geographical Society, of
which body he was one of the founders.
