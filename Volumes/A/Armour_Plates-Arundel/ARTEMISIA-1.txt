ARTEMISIA, daughter of Lygdamis, was queen of Halicarnassus and Cos
about 480 B.C. Being a dependent of Persia, she took part in person in
the expedition of Xerxes against the Greeks, and fitted out five ships,
with which she distinguished herself in the sea-fight near Salamis
(480). When closely pursued by the Athenians she escaped by the
stratagem of attacking one of the Persian vessels, whereupon the
Athenians concluded that she was an ally, and gave up the pursuit
(Herod. vii. 99, viii. 68). After the battle Xerxes declared that the
men had fought like women, and the women like men. By her advice he did
not risk another battle, but at once retired from Greece. She is said to
have loved a young man named Dardanus, of Abydos, and, enraged at his
neglect of her, to have put out his eyes while he was asleep. The gods,
as a punishment for this, ordered her, by an oracle, to take the famous
but rather mythical _lover's leap_ from the Leucadian promontory
(Photius, _Cod. 153a_).
