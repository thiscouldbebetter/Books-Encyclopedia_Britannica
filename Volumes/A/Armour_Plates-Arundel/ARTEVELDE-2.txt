ARTEVELDE, PHILIP VAN (c. 1340-1382), youngest son of the above, and
godson of Queen Philippa of England, who held him in her arms at his
baptism, lived in retirement until 1381. The Ghenters had in that year
risen in revolt against the oppression of the count of Flanders, and
Philip, now forty years of age, and without any military or political
experience, was offered the supreme command. His name awakened general
enthusiasm. At first his efforts were attended by considerable success.
He defeated Louis de Mâle, count of Flanders, before Bruges, entered
that city in triumph, and was soon master of all Flanders. But France
took up the cause of the Flemish count, and a splendid French army was
led across the frontier by the young king Charles VI. in person.
Artevelde advanced to meet the enemy at the head of a burgher army of
some 50,000 Flemings. The armies met at Roosebeke near Courtrai, with
the result that the Flemings were routed with terrible loss, Philip
himself being among the slain. This happened on the 27th of November
1382.

  The brief but stirring career of this popular leader is admirably
  treated in Sir Henry Taylor's drama, _Philip van Artevelde_.
