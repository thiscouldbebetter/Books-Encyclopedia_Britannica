ARTEMON (fl. c. A.D. 230), a prominent Christian teacher at Rome, who
held Adoptianist (see ADOPTIANISM), or humanitarian views, of the same
type as his elder contemporaries the Theodotians, though perhaps
asserting more definitely than they the superiority of Christ to the
prophets in respect of His supernatural birth and sinlessness. He was
excommunicated by Zephyrinus, despite his remarkable claim that all that
bishop's predecessors in the see of Rome had held the humanitarian
position. (See also MONARCHIANISM.)
