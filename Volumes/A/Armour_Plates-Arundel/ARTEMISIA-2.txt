ARTEMISIA, the sister and wife of Mausolus (or Maussollus), king of
Caria, was sole ruler from about 353 to 350 B.C. She has immortalized
herself by the honours paid to the memory of her husband. She built for
him, in Halicarnassus, a very magnificent tomb, called the Mausoleum,
which was one of the seven wonders of the world, and from which the name
mausoleum was afterwards given to all tombs remarkable for their
grandeur. She appointed panegyrics to be composed in his honour, and
offered valuable prizes for the best oratorical and tragic compositions.
She also erected a monument, or trophy, in Rhodes, to commemorate her
conquest of that island. When the Rhodians regained their freedom they
built round this trophy so as to render it inaccessible, whence it was
known as the _Abaton_. There are statues of Mausolus and Artemisia in
the British Museum.
