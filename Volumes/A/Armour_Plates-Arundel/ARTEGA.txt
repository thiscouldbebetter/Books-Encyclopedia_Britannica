ARTEGA, a tribe of African "Arabs," said to be descendants of a sheik of
that name who came from Hadramut in pre-Islamic days, settling near
Tokar. The name is said to be "patrician," and the Artega may be
regarded as the most ancient stock in the Suakin district. They are now
an inferior mixed race. They were all followers of the mahdi and khalifa
in the Sudan wars (1883-1898).
