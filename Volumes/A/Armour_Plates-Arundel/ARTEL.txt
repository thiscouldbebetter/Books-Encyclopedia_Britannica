ARTEL (Russ. for "gang"), the name for the co-operative associations in
Russia. Originally, the artels were true examples of productive
co-operation, bodies of working-men associating together for the purpose
of jointly undertaking some piece of work, and dividing the profits.
This original form of artel still survives among the fishermen of
Archangel. Artels have come, however, to be little more than trade
gilds, with mutual responsibility. (For details see RUSSIA.)
