ARSES, Persian king, youngest son of Artaxerxes III., was raised to the
throne in 338 B.C. by Bagoas (q.v.), who had murdered his father and
all his brothers. But when the young king tried to make himself
independent, Bagoas killed him too, with all his children, in the third
year of his reign (336) (Diod. 17.5; Strabo 15. 736; Trogus, Prol. x.,
Alexander's despatch to Darius III.; Arrian ii. 14. 5, and the
chronographers). In Plutarch, _De fort. Alex._ ii. 3. 5, he is called
_Oarses_; in Johannes Antioch. p. 38, _Arsamos_; in the canon of
Ptolemy, _Aroges_ (by Elias of Nisibis, _Piruz_); in a chronological
tablet from Babylon (Brit. Mus. Sp. ii. 71, _Zeitschrift für
Assyriologie_, viii. 176, x. 64) he is abbreviated into _Ar_. See
