ARTENA, a village of Italy, in the province of Rome, situated at the
N.N.W. extremity of the Volscian Mountains; it is 36 m. S.E. by rail,
and 24 m. direct from Rome. Pop. (1901) 5016. On the mountain above it
(2073 ft.) are the fine remains of the fortifications of a city built in
a very primitive style, in cyclopean blocks of local limestone; within
the walls are traces of buildings, and a massive terrace which supported
some edifice of importance. The name of this city is quite uncertain;
Ecetra is a possible suggestion. The modern village, which was called
Monte Fortino until 1870, owes its present name to an unwarrantable
identification of the site with the ancient Volscian Artena, destroyed
in 404 B.C. Another Artena, which belonged to the district of Caere, and
lay between it and Veii, was destroyed in the period of the kings, and
its site is quite unknown.
