ARTEDI, PETER (1705-1735), Swedish naturalist, was born in the province
of Angermania, in Sweden, on the 22nd of February 1705. Intending to
become a clergyman, he went, in 1724, to study theology at Upsala, but
he turned his attention to medicine and natural history, especially
ichthyology, upon the study of which he exercised great influence (see
ICHTHYOLOGY). In 1728 his countryman Linnaeus arrived in Upsala, and a
lasting friendship was formed between the two. In 1732 both left Upsala,
Artedi for England, and Linnaeus for Lapland; but before parting they
reciprocally bequeathed to each other their manuscripts and books in the
event of death. He was accidentally drowned on the 27th of September
1735 at Amsterdam, where he was engaged in cataloguing the collections
of Albert Seba, a wealthy Dutchman, who had formed what was perhaps the
richest museum of his time. According to agreement, his manuscripts came
into the hands of Linnaeus, and his _Bibliotheca Ichthyologica_ and
_Philosophia Ichthyologica_, together with a life of the author, were
published at Leiden in the year 1738.
