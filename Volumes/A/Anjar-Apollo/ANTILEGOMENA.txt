ANTILEGOMENA ([Greek: antilegomena], contradicted or disputed), an
epithet used by the early Christian writers to denote those books of the
New Testament which, although sometimes publicly read in the churches,
were not for a considerable time admitted to be genuine, or received
into the canon of Scripture. They were thus contrasted with the
_Homologoumena_, or universally acknowledged writings. Eusebius (_Hist.
Eccl._ iii. 25) applies the term _Antilegomena_ to the Epistle of James,
the Epistle of Jude, 2 Peter, 2 and 3 John, the Acts of Paul, the
Shepherd of Hermas, the Teaching of the Apostles, the Apocalypse of
John, and the Gospel according to the Hebrews. In later usage it
describes those of the New Testament books which have obtained a
doubtful place in the Canon. These are the Epistles of James and Jude, 2
Peter, 2 and 3 John, the Apocalypse of John, and the Epistle to the
Hebrews.
