APODICTIC (Gr. [Greek: apodeiktikos], capable of demonstration), a
logical term, applied to judgments which are necessarily true, as of
mathematical conclusions. The term in Aristotelian logic is opposed to
dialectic, as scientific proof to probable reasoning. Kant contrasts
apodictical with problematic and assertorical judgments.
