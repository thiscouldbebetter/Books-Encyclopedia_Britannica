ANTIOCHUS OF SYRACUSE, Greek historian, flourished about 420 B.C.
Nothing is known of his life, but his works, of which only fragments
remain, enjoyed a high reputation. He wrote a _History of Sicily_ from
the earliest times to 424, which was used by Thucydides, and the
_Colonizing of Italy_, frequently referred to by Strabo and Dionysius of
Halicarnassus.
