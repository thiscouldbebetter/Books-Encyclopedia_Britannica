ANTIVARI (Montenegrin _Bar_, so called by the Venetians from its
position opposite Bari in Italy), a seaport of Montenegro which until
1878 belonged to Turkey. Pop. (1900) about 2500. The old town is built
inland, on a strip of country running between the Adriatic Sea and the
Sutorman range of mountains, overshadowed by the peak of Rumiya (5148
ft.). At a few hundred yards' distance it is invisible, hidden among
dense olive groves. Within, there is a ruinous walled village, and the
shell of an old Venetian fortress, surrounded by mosques and bazaars;
for Antivari is rather Turkish than Montenegrin. The fine bay of
Antivari, with Prstan, its port, is distant about one hour's drive
through barren and forbidding country, shut in by mountains. At the
northern horn of the bay stands Spizza, an Austrian military station.
Antivari contains the residence of its Roman Catholic archbishop, and,
in the centre of the shore, Topolitsa, the square undecorated palace of
the crown prince. Antivari is the name applied both to Prstan and the
old town. The Austrian Lloyd steamers call at times, and the "Puglia"
S.S. Company runs a regular service of steamers to and from Bari. As an
outlet for Montenegrin commerce, however, Antivari cannot compete with
the Austrian Cattaro, the harbour being somewhat difficult of access in
stormy weather. Fishing and olive-oil refining are the main industries.
