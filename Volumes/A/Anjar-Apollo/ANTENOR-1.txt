ANTENOR, in Greek legend, one of the wisest of the Trojan elders and
counsellors. He advised his fellow-townsmen to send Helen back to her
husband, and showed himself not unfriendly to the Greeks and an advocate
of peace. In the later story, according to Dares and Dictys, he was said
to have treacherously opened the gates of Troy to the enemy; in return
for which, at the general sack of the city, his house, distinguished by
a panther's skin at the door, was spared by the victors. Afterwards,
according to various versions of the legend, he either rebuilt a city
on the site of Troy, or settled at Cyrene, or became the founder of
Patavium.
