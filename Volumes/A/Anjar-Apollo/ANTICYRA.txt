ANTICYRA, the ancient name of three cities of Greece, (1) (Mod.
_Aspraspitia_), in Phocis, on the bay of Anticyra, in the Corinthian
gulf; some remains are still visible. It was a town of considerable
importance in ancient times; was destroyed by Philip of Macedon;
recovered its prosperity; and was captured by T. Quinctius Flamininus in
198 B.C. The city was famous for its black hellebore, a herb which was
regarded as a cure for insanity. This circumstance gave rise to a number
of proverbial expressions, like [Greek: Antikuras se dei] or "naviget
Anticyram," and to frequent allusions in the Greek and Latin writers.
Hellebore was likewise considered beneficial in cases of gout and
epilepsy. (2) In Thessaly, on the right bank of the river Spercheus,
near its mouth. (3) In Locris, on the north side of the entrance to the
Corinthian gulf, near Naupactus.
