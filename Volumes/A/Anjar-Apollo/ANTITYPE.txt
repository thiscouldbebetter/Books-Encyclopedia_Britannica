ANTITYPE (Gr. [Greek: antitupos]), the correlative of "type," to which
it corresponds as the stamp to the die, or vice versa. In the sense of
copy or likeness the word occurs in the Greek New Testament (Heb. ix.
24; 1 Peter iii. 21), English "figure." By theological writers antitype
is employed to denote the reality of which a type is the prophetic
symbol. Thus, Christ is the antitype of many of the types of the Jewish
ritual. By the fathers of the Greek church (e.g. Gregory Nazianzen)
antitype is employed as a designation of the bread and wine in the
sacrament of the Lord's Supper.
