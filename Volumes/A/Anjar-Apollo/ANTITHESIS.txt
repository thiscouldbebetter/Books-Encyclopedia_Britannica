ANTITHESIS (the Greek for "setting opposite"), in rhetoric, the bringing
out of a contrast in the meaning by an obvious contrast in the
expression, as in the following:--"When there is need of silence, you
speak, and when there is need of speech, you are dumb; when present, you
wish to be absent, and when absent, you desire to be present; in peace
you are for war, and in war you long for peace; in council you descant
on bravery, and in the battle you tremble." Antithesis is sometimes
double or alternate, as in the appeal of Augustus:--"Listen, young men,
to an old man to whom old men were glad to listen when he was young."
The force of the antithesis is increased if the words on which the beat
of the contrast falls are alliterative, or otherwise similar in sound,
as--"The fairest but the falsest of her sex." There is nothing that
gives to expression greater point and vivacity than a judicious
employment of this figure; but, on the other hand, there is nothing more
tedious and trivial than a pseudo-antithetical style. Among English
writers who have made the most abundant use of antithesis are Pope,
Young, Johnson, and Gibbon; and especially Lyly in his _Euphues_. It is,
however, a much more common feature in French than in English; while in
German, with some striking exceptions, it is conspicuous by its absence.
