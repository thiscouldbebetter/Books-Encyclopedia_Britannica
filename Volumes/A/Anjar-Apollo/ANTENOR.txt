ANTENOR, an Athenian sculptor, of the latter part of the 6th century
B.C. He was the author of the group of the tyrannicides Harmodius and
Aristogeiton, set up by the Athenians on the expulsion of the
Peisistratidae, and carried away to Persia by Xerxes. A basis with the
signature of Antenor, son of Eumares, has been shown to belong to one of
the dedicated female figures of archaic style which have been found on
the Acropolis of Athens.
