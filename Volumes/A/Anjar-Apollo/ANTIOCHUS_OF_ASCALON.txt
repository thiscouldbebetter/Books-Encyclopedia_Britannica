ANTIOCHUS OF ASCALON (1st century B.C.), Greek philosopher. His
philosophy consisted in an attempt to reconcile the doctrines of his
teachers Philo of Larissa and Mnesarchus the Stoic. Against the
scepticism of the former, he held that the intellect has in itself a
sufficient test of truth; against Mnesarchus, that happiness, though its
main factor is virtue, depends also on outward circumstances. This
electicism is known as the Fifth Academy (see ACADEMY, GREEK). His
writings are lost, and we are indebted for information to Cicero (_Acad.
Pr._ ii. 43), who studied under him at Athens, and Sextus Empiricus
(_Pyrrh. hyp._ i. 235). Antiochus lectured also in Rome and Alexandria.
