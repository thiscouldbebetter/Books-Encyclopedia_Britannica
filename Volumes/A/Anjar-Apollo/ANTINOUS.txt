ANTINOÜS, a beautiful youth of Claudiopolis in Bithynia, was the
favourite of the emperor Hadrian, whom he accompanied on his journeys.
He committed suicide by drowning himself in the Nile (A.D. 130), either
in a fit of melancholy or in order to prolong his patron's life by his
voluntary sacrifice. After his death, Hadrian caused the most
extravagant respect to be paid to his memory. Not only were cities
called after him, medals struck with his effigy, and statues erected to
him in all parts of the empire, but he was raised to the rank of the
gods, temples were built for his worship in Bithynia, Mantineia in
Arcadia, and Athens, festivals celebrated in his honour and oracles
delivered in his name. The city of Antinoöpolis was founded on the ruins
of Besa where he died (Dio Cassius lix. 11; Spartianus, _Hadrian_). A
number of statues, busts, gems and coins represented Antinoüs as the
ideal type of youthful beauty, often with the attributes of some special
god. We still possess a colossal bust in the Vatican, a bust in the
Louvre, a bas-relief from the Villa Albani, a statue in the Capitoline
museum, another in Berlin, another in the Lateran, and many more.
