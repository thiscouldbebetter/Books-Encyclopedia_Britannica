ANTIPHILUS, a Greek painter, of the age of Alexander. He worked for
Philip of Macedon and Ptolemy I. of Egypt. Thus he was a contemporary of
Apelles, whose rival he is said to have been, but he seems to have
worked in quite another style. Quintilian speaks of his facility: the
descriptions of his works which have come down to us show that he
excelled in light and shade, in genre representations, and in
caricature.
