ANTIGONUS OF CARYSTUS (in Euboea), Greek writer on various subjects,
flourished in the 3rd century B.C. After some time spent at Athens and
in travelling, he was summoned to the court of Attalus I. (241-197) of
Pergamum. His chief work was the _Lives of Philosophers_ drawn from
personal knowledge, of which considerable fragments are preserved in
Athenaeus and Diogenes Laertius. We still possess his _Collection of
Wonderful Tales_, chiefly extracted from the [Greek: Thaumasia
Akousmata] attributed to Aristotle and the [Greek: Thaumasia] of
Callimachus. It is doubtful whether he is identical with the sculptor
who, according to Pliny (_Nat. Hist._ xxxiv. 19), wrote books on his
art.
