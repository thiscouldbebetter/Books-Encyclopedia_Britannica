ANTIGONUS GONATAS (c. 319-239 B.C.), Macedonian king, was the son of
Demetrius Poliorcetes, and grandson of Antigonus Cyclops. On the death
of his father (283), he assumed the title of king of Macedonia, but did
not obtain possession of the throne till 276, after it had been
successively in the hands of Pyrrhus, Lysimachus, Seleucus, and Ptolemy
Ceraunus. Antigonus repelled the invasion of the Gauls, and continued in
undisputed possession of Macedonia till 274, when Pyrrhus returned from
Italy, and (in 273) made himself master of nearly all the country. On
the advance of Pyrrhus into Peloponnesus, he recovered his dominions. He
was again (between 263 and 255) driven out of his kingdom by Alexander,
the son of Pyrrhus, and again recovered it. The latter part of his reign
was comparatively peaceful, and he gained the affection of his subjects
by his honesty and his cultivation of the arts. He gathered round him
distinguished literary men--philosophers, poets, and historians. He died
in the eightieth year of his age, and the forty-fourth of his reign. His
surname was usually derived by later Greek writers from the name of his
supposed birthplace, Gonni (Gonnus) in Thessaly; some take it to be a
Macedonian word signifying an iron plate for protecting the knee;
neither conjecture is a happy one, and in our ignorance of the
Macedonian language it must remain unexplained.
