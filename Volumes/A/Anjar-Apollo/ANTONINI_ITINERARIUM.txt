ANTONINI ITINERARIUM, a valuable register, still extant, of the stations
and distances along the various roads of the Roman empire, seemingly
based on official documents, which were probably those of the survey
organized by Julius Caesar, and carried out under Augustus. Nothing is
known with certainty as to the date or author. It is considered probable
that the date of the original edition was the beginning of the 3rd
century, while that which we possess is to be assigned to the time of
Diocletian. If the author or promoter of the work is one of the
emperors, it is most likely to be Antoninus Caracalla.

  Editions by Wesseling, 1735, Parthey and Pindar, 1848. The portion
  relating to Britain was published under the title _Iter Britanniarum_,
  with commentary by T. Reynolds, 1799.
