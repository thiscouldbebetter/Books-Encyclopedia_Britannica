ANTIOCH IN PISIDIA, an ancient city, the remains of which, including
ruins of temples, a theatre and a fine aqueduct, were found by Arundell
in 1833 close to the modern Yalovach. It was situated on the lower
southern slopes of the Sultan Dagh, in the Konia vilayet of Asia Minor,
on the right bank of a stream, the ancient Anthius, which flows into the
Hoiran Geul. It was probably founded on the site of a Phrygian
sanctuary, by Seleucus Nicator, before 280 B.C. and was made a free city
by the Romans in 189 B.C. It was a thoroughly Hellenized, Greek-speaking
city, in the midst of a Phrygian people, with a mixed population that
included many Jews. Before 6 B.C. Augustus made it a colony, with the
title Caesarea, and it became the centre of civil and military
administration in south Galatia, the romanization of which was
progressing rapidly in the time of Claudius, A.D. 41-54, when Paul
visited it (Acts xiii. 14, xiv. 21, xvi. 6, xviii. 23). In 1097 the
crusaders found rest and shelter within its walls. The ruins are
interesting, and show that Antioch was a strongly fortified city of
Hellenic and Roman type.
