ANTONIO DE LEBRIJA [ANTONIUS NEBRISSENSIS], (1444-1522), Spanish
scholar, was born at Lebrija in the province of Andalusia. After
studying at Salamanca he resided for ten years in Italy, and completed
his education at Bologna University. On his return to Spain (1473), he
devoted himself to the advancement of classical learning amongst his
countrymen. After holding the professorship of poetry and grammar at
Salamanca, he was transferred to the university of Alcalá de Henares,
where he lectured until his death in 1522, at the age of seventy-eight.
His services to the cause of classical literature in Spain have been
compared with those rendered by Valla, Erasmus and Budaeus to Italy,
Holland and France. He produced a large number of works on a variety of
subjects, including a Latin and Spanish dictionary, commentaries on
Sedulius and Persius, and a Compendium of Rhetoric, based on Aristotle,
Cicero and Quintilian. His most ambitious work was his chronicle
entitled _Rerum in Hispania Gestarum Decades_ (published in 1545 by his
son as an original work by his father), which twenty years later was
found to be merely a Latin translation of the Spanish chronicle of
Pulgar, which was published at Saragossa in 1567. De Lebrija also took
part in the production of the Complutense polyglot Bible published under
the patronage of Cardinal Jimenes.
