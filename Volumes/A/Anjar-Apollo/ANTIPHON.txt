ANTIPHON, of Rhamnus in Attica, the earliest of the "ten" Attic orators,
was born in 480 B.C. He took an active part in political affairs at
Athens, and, as a zealous supporter of the oligarchical party, was
largely responsible for the establishment of the Four Hundred in 411
(see THERAMENES); on the restoration of the democracy he was accused of
treason and condemned to death. Thucydides (viii. 68) expresses a very
high opinion of him. Antiphon may be regarded as the founder of
political oratory, but he never addressed the people himself except on
the occasion of his trial. Fragments of his speech then delivered in
defence of his policy (called [Greek: Peri metastaseos]) have been
edited by J. Nicole (1907) from an Egyptian papyrus. His chief business
was that of a professional speech-writer ([Greek: logographos]), for
those who felt incompetent to conduct their own cases--as all disputants
were obliged to do--without expert assistance. Fifteen of Antiphon's
speeches are extant: twelve are mere school exercises on fictitious
cases, divided into tetralogies, each consisting of two speeches for
prosecution and defence--accusation, defence, reply, counter-reply;
three refer to actual legal processes. All deal with cases of homicide
([Greek: phonikai dikai]). Antiphon is also said to have composed a
[Greek: Techne] or art of Rhetoric.
