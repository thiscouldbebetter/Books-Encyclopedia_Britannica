ANTHON, CHARLES (1797-1867), American classical scholar, was born in New
York city on the 19th of November 1797. After graduating with honours at
Columbia College in 1815, he began the study of law, and in 1819 was
admitted to the bar, but never practised. In 1820 he was appointed
assistant professor of Greek and Latin in his old college, full
professor ten years later, and at the same time headmaster of the
grammar school attached to the college, which post he held until 1864.
He died at New York on the 29th of July 1867. He produced for use in
colleges and schools a large number of classical works, which enjoyed
great popularity, although his editions of classical authors were by no
means in favour with schoolmasters, owing to the large amount of
assistance, especially translations, contained in the notes.
