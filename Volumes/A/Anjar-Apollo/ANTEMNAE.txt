ANTEMNAE (Lat. _ante amnem_, sc. _Anienem_; Varro, _Ling. Lat_. v. 28),
an ancient village of Latium, situated on the W. of the Via Salaria, 2
m. N. of Rome, where the Anio falls into the Tiber. It is said to have
been conquered by Romulus after the rape of the Sabine women, and to
have assisted the Tarquins. Certainly it soon lost its independence, and
in Strabo's time was a mere village. The site is one of great strength,
and is now occupied by a fort, in the construction of which traces of
the outer walls and of huts, and several wells and a cistern, all
belonging to the primitive village, were discovered, and also the
remains of a villa of the end of the Republic.
