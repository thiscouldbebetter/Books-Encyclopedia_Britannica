ANTIPHANES, the most important writer of the Middle Attic comedy with
the exception of Alexis, lived from about 408 to 334 B.C. He was
apparently a foreigner who settled in Athens, where he began to write
about 387. He was extremely prolific: more than 200 of the 365 (or 260)
comedies attributed to him are known to us from the titles and
considerable fragments preserved in Athenaeus. They chiefly deal with
matters connected with the table, but contain many striking sentiments.

  Fragments in Koch, _Comicorum Atticorum Fragmenta_, ii. (1884); see
  also Clinton, _Philological Museum_, i. (1832); Meineke, _Historia
  Critica Comicorum Graecorum_ (1839).
