ANTIBES, a seaport town in the French department of the Alpes-Maritimes
(formerly in that of the Var, but transferred after the Alpes-Maritimes
department was formed in 1860 out of the county of Nice). Pop. (1906) of
the town, 5730; of the commune, 11,753. It is 12½ m. by rail S.W. of
Nice, and is situated on the E. side of the Garoupe peninsula. It was
formerly fortified, but all the ramparts (save the Fort Carré, built by
Vauban) have now been demolished, and a new town is rising on their
site. There is a tolerable harbour, with a considerable fishing
industry. The principal exports are dried fruits, salt fish and oil.
Much perfume distilling is done here, as the surrounding country
produces an abundance of flowers. Antibes is the ancient Antipolis. It
is said to have been founded before the Christian era (perhaps about 340
B.C.) by colonists from Marseilles, and is mentioned by Strabo. It was
the seat of a bishopric from the 5th century to 1244, when the see was
transferred to Grasse.     (W. A. B. C.)
