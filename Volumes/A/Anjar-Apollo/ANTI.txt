ANTI, or CAMPA, a tribe of South American Indians of Arawakan stock,
inhabiting the forests of the upper Ucayali basin, east of Cuzco, on the
eastern side of the Andes, south Peru. The Antis, who gave their name to
the eastern province of Antisuyu, have always been notorious for
ferocity and cannibalism. They are of fine physique and generally
good-looking. Their dress is a robe with holes for the head and arms.
Their long hair hangs down over the shoulders, and round their necks a
toucan beak or a bunch of feathers is worn as an ornament.
