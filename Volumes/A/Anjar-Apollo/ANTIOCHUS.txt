ANTIOCHUS, the name of thirteen kings of the Seleucid dynasty in Nearer
Asia. The most famous are Antiochus III. the Great (223-187 B.C.) who
sheltered Hannibal and waged war with Rome, and his son Antiochus IV.
Epiphanes (176-164 B.C.) who tried to suppress Judaism by persecution
(see SELEUCID DYNASTY).

The name was subsequently borne by the kings of Commagene (69 B.C.-A.D.
72), whose house was affiliated to the Seleucid.

ANTIOCHUS I. of Commagene, who without sufficient reason has been
identified with the Seleucid Antiochus XIII. Asiaticus, made peace on
advantageous terms with Pompey in 64 B.C. Subsequently he fought on
Pompey's side in the Civil War, and later still repelled an attack on
Samosata by Marcus Antonius (Mark Antony.) He died before 31 B.C. and
was succeeded by one Mithradates I. This Mithradates was succeeded by an

ANTIOCHUS II., who was executed by Augustus in 29 B.C. After another
Mithradates we know of an ANTIOCHUS III., on whose death in A.D. 17
Commagene became a Roman province. In 38 his son ANTIOCHUS IV. EPIPHANES
was made king by Caligula, who deposed him almost immediately. Restored
by Claudius in 41, he reigned until 72 as an ally of Rome against
Parthia. In that year he was deposed on suspicion of treason and retired
to Rome. Several of his coins are extant.
