APHELION (from Gr. [Greek: apo], from, and [Greek: hêlios], sun), in
astronomy, that point of the orbit of a planet at which it is most
distant from the sun. Apogee, Apocentre, Aposaturnium, &c. are terms
applied to those points of the orbit of a body moving around a centre of
force--as the Earth, Saturn, &c.--at which it is farthest from the
central body.
