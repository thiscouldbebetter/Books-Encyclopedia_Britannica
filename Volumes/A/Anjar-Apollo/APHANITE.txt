APHANITE, a name given (from the Gr. [Greek: aphanês], invisible) to
certain dark-coloured igneous rocks which are so fine-grained that their
component minerals are not detected by the unaided eye. They consist
essentially of plagioclase felspar, with hornblende or augite, and may
contain also biotite, quartz and a limited amount of orthoclase.
Although a few authorities still recognize the aphanites as a distinct
class, most systematic petrologists, at the present time, have discarded
it, and regard these rocks as merely structural facies of other species.
Those which contain hornblende are uniform, fine-grained diorites,
vogesites, &c., while when pyroxene predominates they are ascribed to
the dolerites, quartz-dolerites, &c. Hence, any rock which is compact,
crystalline and fine grained, is frequently said to be _aphanitic_,
without implying exactly to which of the principal rock groups it really
belongs.
