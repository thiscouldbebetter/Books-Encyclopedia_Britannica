ANTONINUS, SAINT [ANTONIO PIEROZZI, also called DE FORCIGLIONI]
(1389-1459), archbishop of Florence, was born at that city on the 1st of
March 1389. He entered the Dominican order in his 16th year, and was
soon entrusted, in spite of his youth, with the government of various
houses of his order at Cortona, Rome, Naples and Florence, which he
laboured zealously to reform. He was consecrated archbishop of Florence
in 1446, and won the esteem and love of his people, especially by his
energy and resource in combating the effects of the plague and
earthquake in 1448 and 1453. He died on the 2nd of May 1459, and was
canonized by Pope Adrian VI. in 1523. His feast is annually celebrated
on the 13th of May. Antoninus had a great reputation for theological
learning, and sat as papal theologian at the council of Florence (1439).
Of his various works, the list of which is given in Quétif-Echard, _De
Scriptoribus Ord. Praedicat_., i. 818, the best-known are his _Summa
theologica_ (Venice, 1477; Verona, 1740) and the _Summa confessionalis_
(Mondovi, 1472), invaluable to confessors.
