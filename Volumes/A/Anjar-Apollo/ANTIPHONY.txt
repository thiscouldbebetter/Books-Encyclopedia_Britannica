ANTIPHONY (Gr. [Greek: anti], and [Greek: phone], a voice), a species of
psalmody in which the choir or congregation, being divided into two
parts, sing alternately. The peculiar structure of the Hebrew psalms
renders it probable that the antiphonal method originated in the service
of the ancient Jewish Church. According to the historian Socrates, its
introduction into Christian worship was due to Ignatius (died 115 A.D.),
who in a vision had seen the angels singing in alternate choirs. In the
Latin Church it was not practised until more than two centuries later,
when it was introduced by Ambrose, bishop of Milan, who compiled an
antiphonary, or collection of words suitable for antiphonal singing. The
antiphonary still in use in the Roman Catholic Church was compiled by
Gregory the Great (590 A.D.).
