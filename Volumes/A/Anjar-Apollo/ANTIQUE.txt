ANTIQUE (Lat. _antiquus_, old), a term conventionally restricted to the
remains of ancient art, such as sculptures, gems, medals, seals, &c. In
a limited sense it applies only to Greek and Roman art, and includes
neither the artistic remains of other ancient nations nor any product of
classical art of a later date than the fall of the western empire.
