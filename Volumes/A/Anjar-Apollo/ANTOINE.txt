ANTOINE, ANDRÉ (1858-   ), French actor-manager, was born at Limoges,
and in his early years was in business. But he was an enthusiastic
amateur actor, and in 1887 he founded in Paris the Théâtre Libre, in
order to realize his ideas as to the proper development of dramatic art.
For an account of his work, which had enormous influence on the French
stage, see DRAMA: _France_. In 1894 he gave up the direction of this
theatre, and became connected with the Gymnase, and later (1896) with
the Odéon.
