ANTIPAROS (anc. _Oliaros_), an island of the kingdom of Greece, in the
modern eparchy of Naxos, separated by a strait (about 1½ m. wide at the
narrowest point) from the west coast of Pares. It is 7 m. long by 3
broad, and contains about 700 inhabitants, most of whom live in Kastro,
a village on the north coast, and are employed in agriculture and
fishing. Formerly piracy was common. The only remarkable feature in the
island is a stalactite cavern on the south coast, which is reached by a
narrow passage broken by two steep and dangerous descents which are
accomplished by the aid of rope-ladders. The grotto itself, which is
about 150 ft. by 100, and 50 ft. high (not all can be seen from any
part, and probably some portions are still unexplored), shows many
remarkable examples of stalactite formations and incrustations of
dazzling brilliance. It is not mentioned by ancient writers; the first
western traveller to visit it was the marquis de Nointel (ambassador of
Louis XIV. to the Porte) who descended it with a numerous suite and held
high mass there on Christmas day 1673. There is, however, in the
entrance of the cavern an inscription recording the names of visitors in
ancient times.
