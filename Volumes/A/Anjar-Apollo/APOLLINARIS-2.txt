APOLLINARIS, SULPICIUS, a learned grammarian of Carthage, who flourished
in the 2nd century A.D. He taught Pertinax--himself a teacher of grammar
before he was emperor,--and Aulus Gellius, who speaks of him in the
highest terms (iv. 17). He is the reputed author of the metrical
arguments to the _Aeneid_ and to the plays of Terence and (probably)
Plautus (J.W. Beck, _De Sulpicio Apollinari_, 1884).
