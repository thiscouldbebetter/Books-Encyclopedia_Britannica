ANTHRACOTHERIUM ("coal-animal," so called from the fact of the remains
first described having been obtained from the Tertiary lignite-beds of
Europe), a genus of extinct artiodactyle ungulate mammals, characterized
by having 44 teeth, with five semi-crescentic cusps on the crowns of the
upper molars. In many respects, especially the form of the lower jaw,
_Anthracotherium_, which is of Oligocene and Miocene age in Europe, and
typifies the family _Anthracotheriidae_, is allied to the hippopotamus,
of which it is probably an ancestral form. The European _A. magnum_ was
as large as the last-mentioned animal, but there were several smaller
species and the genus also occurs in Egypt, India and North America.
