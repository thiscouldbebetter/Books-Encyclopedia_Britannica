ANTONIO, NICOLAS (1617-1684), Spanish bibliographer, was born at Seville
on the 31st of July 1617. After taking his degree at Salamanca
(1636-1639), he returned to his native city, wrote his treatise _De
Exilio_ (which was not printed till 1659), and began his monumental
register of Spanish writers. The fame of his learning reached Philip
IV., who conferred the order of Santiago on him in 1645, and sent him as
general agent to Rome in 1654. Returning to Spain in 1679, Antonio died
at Madrid in the spring of 1684. His _Bibliotheca Hispana nova_, dealing
with the works of Spanish authors who flourished after 1500, appeared at
Rome in 1672; the _Bibliotheca Hispana vetus_, a literary history of
Spain from the time of Augustus to the end of the 15th century, was
revised by Manuel Martí, and published by Antonio's friend, Cardinal
José Saenz de Aguirre at Rome in 1696. A fine edition of both parts,
with additional matter found in Antonio's manuscripts, and with
supplementary notes by Francisco Perez Bayer, was issued at Madrid in
1787-1788. This great work, incomparably superior to any previous
bibliography, is still unsuperseded and indispensable.

  Of Antonio's miscellaneous writings the most important is the
  posthumous _Censura de historias fabulosas_ (Valencia, 1742), in which
  erudition is combined with critical insight. His _Bibliotheca Hispana
  rabinica_ has not been printed; the manuscript is in the national
  library at Madrid.
