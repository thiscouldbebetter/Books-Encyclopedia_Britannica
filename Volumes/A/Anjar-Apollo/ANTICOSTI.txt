ANTICOSTI, an island of the province of Quebec, Canada, situated in the
Gulf of St Lawrence, between 49° and 50° N., and between 61° 40' and 64°
30' W., with a length of 135 m. and a breadth of 30 m. Population 250,
consisting chiefly of the keepers of the numerous lighthouses erected by
the Canadian government. The coast is dangerous, and the only two
harbours, Ellis Bay and Fox Bay, are very indifferent. Anticosti was
sighted by Jacques Cartier in 1534, and named Assomption. In 1763 it was
ceded by France to Britain, and in 1774 became part of Canada. Wild
animals, especially bears, are numerous, but prior to 1896 the fish and
game had been almost exterminated by indiscriminate slaughter. In that
year Anticosti and the shore fisheries were leased to M. Menier, the
French chocolate manufacturer, who converted the island into a game
preserve, and attempted to develop its resources of lumber, peat and
minerals.
