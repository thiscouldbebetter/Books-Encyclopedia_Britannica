ANTONOMASIA, in rhetoric, the Greek term for a substitution of any
epithet or phrase for a proper name; as "Pelides," or "the son of
Peleus," for Achilles; "the Stagirite" for Aristotle; "the author of
_Paradise Lost_" for Milton; "the little corporal" for Napoleon I.;
"Macedonia's madman" for Alexander the Great, &c. &c. The opposite
substitution of a proper name for some generic term is also sometimes
called antonomasia; as "a Cicero" for an orator.
