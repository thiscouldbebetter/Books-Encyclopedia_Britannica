ANTIPYRINE (phenyldimethyl pyrazolone) (C11H12N2O), is prepared by the
condensation of phenylhydrazine with aceto-acetic ester, the resulting
phenyl methyl pyrazolone being heated with methyl iodide and methyl
alcohol to 100-110° C.:

        CH3·C=N \               CH3·C-N·CH3
                 >N·C6H5   ->       || >N·C6H5
         CH2-CO /                HC-CO
  Phenyl methyl pyrazolone        Antipyrine

On the large scale phenylhydrazine is dissolved in dilute sulphuric
acid, the solution warmed to about 40° C. and the aceto-acetic ester
added. When the reaction is complete the acid is neutralized with soda,
and the phenyl methyl pyrazolone extracted with ether and distilled _in
vacuo_. The portion distilling at about 200° C. is then methylated by
means of methyl alcohol and methyl iodide at 100-110° C., the excess of
methyl alcohol removed and the product obtained decolorized by sulphuric
acid. The residue is treated with a warm concentrated solution of soda,
and the oil which separates is removed by shaking with benzene. The
benzene layer on evaporation deposits the anti-pyrine as a colourless
crystalline solid which melts at 113° C. and is soluble in water. It is
basic in character, and gives a red coloration on the addition of ferric
chloride. In medicine anti-pyrine ("phenazonum") has been used as an
analgesic and antipyretic. The dose is 5-20 grs., but on account of its
depressant action on the heart, and the toxic effects to which it
occasionally gives rise, it is now but little used. It is more safely
replaced by phenacetine.
