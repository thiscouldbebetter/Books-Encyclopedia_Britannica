ANNOBON, or ANNO BOM, an island in the Gulf of Guinea, in 1° 24' S. and
5° 35' E., belonging to Spain. It is 110 m. S.W. of St Thomas. Its
length is about 4 m., its breadth 2, and its area 6¾ sq. m. Rising in
some parts nearly 3000 ft. above the sea, it presents a succession of
beautiful valleys and steep mountains, covered with rich woods and
luxuriant vegetation. The inhabitants, some 3000 in number, are negroes
and profess belief in the Roman Catholic faith. The chief town and
residence of the governor is called St Antony (San Antonio de Praia).
The roadstead is tolerably safe, and passing vessels take advantage of
it in order to obtain water and fresh provisions, of which Annobon
contains an abundant supply. The island was discovered by the Portuguese
on the 1st of January 1473, from which circumstance it received its name
(= New Year). Annobon, together with Fernando Po, was ceded to Spain by
the Portuguese in 1778. The islanders revolted against their new masters
and a state of anarchy ensued, leading, it is averred, to an arrangement
by which the island was administered by a body of five natives, each of
whom held the office of governor during the period that elapsed till ten
ships touched at the island. In the latter part of the 19th century the
authority of Spain was re-established.
