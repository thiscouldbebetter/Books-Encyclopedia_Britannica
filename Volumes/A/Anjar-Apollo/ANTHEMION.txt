ANTHEMION (from the Gr. [Greek: anthemion], a flower), the conventional
design of flower or leaf forms which was largely employed by the Greeks
to decorate (1) the fronts of ante-fixae, (2) the upper portion of the
stele or vertical tombstones, (3) the necking of the Ionic columns of
the Erechtheum and its continuation as a decorative frieze on the walls
of the same, and (4) the cymatium of a cornice. Though generally known
as the honeysuckle ornament, from its resemblance to that flower, its
origin will be found in the flower of the acanthus plant.
