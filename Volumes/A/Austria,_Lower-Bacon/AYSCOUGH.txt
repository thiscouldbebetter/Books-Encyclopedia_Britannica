AYSCOUGH, SAMUEL (1745-1804), English librarian and index-maker, was born
at Nottingham in 1745. His father, a printer and stationer, having ruined
himself by speculation, Samuel Ayscough left Nottingham for London, where
he obtained an engagement in the cataloguing department of the British
Museum. In 1782 he published a two-volume catalogue of the then undescribed
manuscripts in the museum. About 1785 he was appointed assistant librarian
at the museum, and soon afterwards took holy orders. In 1786 he published
an index to the first seventy volumes of the _Monthly Review_, and in 1796
indexed the remaining volumes. Both this index and his catalogue of the
undescribed manuscripts in the museum were private ventures. His first
official work was a third share in the British Museum catalogue of 1787,
and he subsequently catalogued the ancient rolls and charters, 16,000 in
all. In 1789 he produced the first two volumes of the index to the
_Gentleman's Magazine_, and in 1790 the first index-concordance to
Shakespeare. He was a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries, and has been
called [v.03 p.0077] "The Prince of Indexers." He died at the British
Museum on the 30th of October 1804.
