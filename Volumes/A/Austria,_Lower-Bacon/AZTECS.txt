AZTECS (from the Nahuatl word _aztlan_, "place of the Heron," or "Heron"
people), the native name of one of the tribes that occupied the tableland
of Mexico on the arrival of the Spaniards in America. It has been very
frequently employed as equivalent to the collective national title of
Nahuatlecas or Mexicans. The Aztecs came, according to native tradition,
from a country to which they gave the name of Aztlan, usually supposed to
lie towards the north-west, but the satisfactory localization of it is one
of the greatest difficulties in Mexican history. The date of the exodus
from Aztlan is equally undetermined, being fixed by various authorities in
the 11th and by others in the 12th century. One Mexican manuscript gives a
date equivalent to A.D. 1164. They gradually increased their influence
among other tribes, until, by union with the Toltecs, who occupied the
tableland before them, they extended their empire to an area of from 18,000
to 20,000 square leagues. The researches of Humboldt gave the first clear
insight into the early periods of their history. See MEXICO; NAHUATLAN
