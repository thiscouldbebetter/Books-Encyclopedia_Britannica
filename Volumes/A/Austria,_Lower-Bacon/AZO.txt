AZO (_c._ 1150-1230), Italian jurist. This Azo, whose name is sometimes
written Azzo and Azzolenus, and who is occasionally described as Azo
Soldanus, from the surname of his father, is to be distinguished from two
other famous Italians of the same name, viz. Azo Lambertaccius, a canonist
of the 13th century, professor of canon law at the university of Bologna,
author of _Questiones in jus canonicum_, and Azo de Ramenghis, a canonist
of the 14th century, also a professor of canon law at Bologna, and author
of _Repetitiones super libro Decretorum_. Few particulars are known as to
the life of Azo, further than that he was born at Bologna about the middle
of the 12th century, and was a pupil of Joannes Bassianus, and afterwards
became professor of civil law in the university of his native town. He also
took an active part in municipal life, Bologna, with the other Lombard
republics, having gained its municipal independence. Azo occupied a very
important position amongst the glossators, and his _Readings on the Code_,
which were collected by his pupil, Alessandro de Santo Aegidio, and
completed by the additions of Hugolinus and Odofredus, form a methodical
exposition of Roman law, and were of such weight before the tribunals that
it used to be said, "Chi non ha Azzo, non vada a palazzo." Azo gained a
great reputation as a professor, and numbered amongst his pupils Accursius
and Jacobus Balduinus. He died about 1230.
