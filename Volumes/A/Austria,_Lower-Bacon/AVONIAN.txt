AVONIAN, in geology, the name proposed by Dr A. Vaughan in 1905 (_Q.J.G.S._
vol. lxi. p. 264) for the rocks of Lower Carboniferous age in the Avon
gorge at Bristol. The Avonian stage appears to embrace precisely the same
rocks and fossil-zones as the earlier designation "Dinantien" (see
CARBONIFEROUS SYSTEM); but its substages, being founded upon different
local conditions and a different interpretation of the zonal fossils, do
not correspond exactly with those of the French and Belgian geologists.

               Substages.       ZONES.        Substages.

            { Kidwellian  { _Dibunophyllum_ }             }
            {             { _Seminula_      } Viséen      }
    Avonian {                               }             } Dinantien
            {             { _Syringothyris_ }             }
            { Clevedonian {                               }
            {             { _Zaphrentis_    } Tournaisien }
            {             { _Cleistopora_   }             }

The upper Avonian (Kidwellian) is well developed about Kidwelly in
Carmarthenshire. The lower substage (Clevedonian) is well displayed near
Clevedon in Somerset.
