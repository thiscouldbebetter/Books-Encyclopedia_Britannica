AVARAY, a French territorial title belonging to a family some of whose
members have been conspicuous in history. The Béarnaise family named
Bésiade moved into the province of Orléanais in the 17th century, and there
acquired the estate of Avaray. In 1667 Théophile de Bésiade, marquis
d'Avaray, obtained the office of grand bailiff of Orleans, which was held
by several of his descendants after him. Claude Antoine de Bésiade, marquis
d'Avaray, was deputy for the bailliage of Orleans in the states-general of
1789, and proposed a _Declaration of the Duties of Man_ as a pendant to the
_Declaration of the Rights of Man_; he subsequently became a
lieutenant-general in 1814, a peer of France in 1815, and duc d'Avaray in
1818. Antoine Louis François, comte d'Avaray, son of the above,
distinguished himself during the Revolution by his devotion to the comte de
Provence, afterwards Louis XVIII., whose emigration he assisted. Having
nominally become king in 1799, that prince created the estate of
Ile-Jourdain a duchy, under the title of Avaray, in favour of the comte
d'Avaray, whom he termed his "liberator."
