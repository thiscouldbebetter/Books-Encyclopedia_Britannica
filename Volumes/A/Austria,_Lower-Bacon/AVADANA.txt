AVAD[=A]NA, the name given to a type of Buddhist romance literature
represented by a large number of Sanskrit (Nepalese) collections, of which
the chief are the Avad[=a]nasataka (Century of Legends), and the
Divy[=a]vad[=a]na (The Heavenly Legend). Though of later date than most of
the canonical Buddhist books, they are held in veneration by the orthodox,
and occupy much the same position with regard to Buddhism that the
Pur[=a]nas do towards Brahminism.
