AUXILIARY (from Lat. _auxilium_, help), that which gives aid or support;
the term is used in grammar of a verb which completes the tense, mood or
voice of another verb; in engineering, _e.g._ of the low steam power used
to supplement the sail-power in sailing ships, still occasionally used in
yachts, sealers or whalers; and in military use, of foreign or allied
troops, more properly of any troops not permanently maintained under arms.
In the British army the term "Auxiliary Forces" was employed formerly to
include the Militia, the Imperial Yeomanry and the Volunteers.
