AZUNI, DOMENICO ALBERTO (1749-1827), Italian jurist, was born at Sassar, in
Sardinia, in 1749. He studied law at Sassari and Turin, and in 1782 was
made judge of the consulate at Nice. In 1786-1788 he published his
_Dizionario Universale Ragionato della Giurisprudenza Mercantile_. In 1795
appeared his systematic work on the maritime law of Europe, _Sistema
Universale dei Principii del Diritto Maritimo dell' Europa_, which he
afterwards recast and translated into French. In 1806 he was appointed one
of the French commission engaged in drawing up a general code of commercial
law, and in the following year he proceeded to Genoa as president of the
court of appeal. After the fall of Napoleon in 1814, Azuni lived for a time
in retirement at Genoa, till he was invited to Sardinia by Victor Emmanuel
I., and appointed judge of the consulate at Cagliari, and director of the
university library. He died at Cagliari in 1827. Azuni also wrote numerous
pamphlets and minor works, chiefly on maritime law, an important treatise
on the origin and progress of maritime law (Paris, 1810), and an
historical, geographical and political account of Sardinia (1799, enlarged
1802).
