AXE (O. Eng. _aex_; a word common, in different forms, in the Teutonic
languages, and akin to the Greek [Greek: axinê]; the _New English
Dictionary_ prefers the spelling "ax"), a tool or weapon, taking various
shapes, but, when not compounded with some distinguishing word (_e.g._ in
"pick-axe"), generally formed [v.03 p.0068] by an edged head fixed upon a
handle for striking. A "hatchet" is a small sort of axe.
