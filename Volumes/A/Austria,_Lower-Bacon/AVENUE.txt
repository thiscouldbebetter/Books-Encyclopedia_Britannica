AVENUE (the past participle feminine of Fr. _avenir_, to come to), a way of
approach; more particularly, the chief entrance-road to a country house,
with rows of trees on each side; the trees themselves are said to form the
avenue. In modern times the word has been much used as a name for streets
in towns, whether with or without trees, such as Fifth Avenue in New York,
or Shaftesbury Avenue in London.
