AVENGER OF BLOOD, the person, usually the nearest kinsman of the murdered
man, whose duty it was to avenge his death by killing the murderer. In
primitive societies, before the evolution of settled government, or the
uprise of a systematized criminal law, crimes of violence were regarded as
injuries of a personal character to be punished by the sufferer or his
kinsfolk. This right of vengeance was common to most countries, and in many
was the subject of strict regulations and limitations. It was prevented
from running into excesses by the law of sanctuary (_q.v._) and in many
lands the institution of blood-money, and the wergild offered the
wrong-doer a mode of escaping from his enemies' revenge. The Mosaic law
recognized the right of vengeance, but not the money-compensation. The
Koran, on the contrary, while sanctioning the vengeance, also permits
pecuniary commutation for murder.
