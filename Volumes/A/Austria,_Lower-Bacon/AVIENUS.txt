AVIENUS, RUFIUS FESTUS, a Roman aristocrat and poet, of Vulsinii in
Etruria, who flourished during the second half of the 4th century A.D. He
was probably proconsul of Africa (366) and of Achaia (372). Avienus was a
pagan and a staunch supporter of the old religion. He translated the
[Greek: Phainomena] of Aratus and paraphrased the [Greek: Periêgêsis] of
Dionysius under the title of _Descriptio Orbis Terrarum_, both in
hexameters. He also compiled a description, in iambic trimeters, of the
coasts of the Mediterranean, Caspian and Black Seas in several books, of
which only a fragment of the first is extant. He also epitomized Livy and
Virgil's _Aeneid_ in the same metre, but these works are lost. Some minor
poems are found under his name in anthologies, _e.g._ a humorous request to
one Favianus for some pomegranates for medicinal purposes.
