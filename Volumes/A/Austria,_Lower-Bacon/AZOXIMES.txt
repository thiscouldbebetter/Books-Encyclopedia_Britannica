AZOXIMES (furo [a.b.] diazoles), a class of organic compounds which contain
the ring system

<math>HC = N  N = CH[|]\/[|]O.<math>

They may be prepared by converting nitriles into amidoximes by the action
of hydroxylamine, the amidoximes so formed being then acylated by acid
chlorides or anhydrides. From these acyl derivatives the elements of water
are removed, either by simple heating or by boiling their aqueous solution;
this elimination is accompanied by the formation of the azoxime ring. Thus

            NH_2OH            // N·OH   boil with
  C_6H_5CN --------> C_6H_5·C           -------->
                              \  NH_2   propionic anhydride

    [         //N·O·COC_2H_5 ]             // N·O \
    [ C_6H_5C                ] --> C_6H_5·C        C·C_2H_5.
    [         \ NH_2         ]             \  N   //

[v.03 p.0086] Azoximes can also be produced from [alpha]-benzil dioxime by
the "Beckmann" change. Most of the azoximes are very volatile substances,
sublime readily, and are easily soluble in water, alcohol and benzene.
