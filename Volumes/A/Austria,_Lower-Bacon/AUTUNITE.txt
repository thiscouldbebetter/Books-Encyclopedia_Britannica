AUTUNITE, or CALCO-URANITE, a mineral which is one of the "uranium micas,"
differing from the more commonly occurring torbernite (_q.v._) or
cupro-uranite in containing calcium in place of copper. It is a hydrous
uranium and calcium phosphate, Ca(UO_2)_2(PO_4)_2 + 8(or 12)H_2O. Though
closely resembling the tetragonal torbernite in form, it crystallizes in
the orthorhombic system and is optically biaxial. The crystals have the
shape of thin plates with very nearly square outline (89° 17' instead of
90°). An important character is the perfect micaceous cleavage parallel to
the basal plane, on which plane the lustre is pearly. The colour is
sulphur-yellow, and this enables the mineral to be distinguished at a
glance from the emerald-green torbernite. Hardness 2-2½; specific gravity
3.05-3.19. Autunite is usually found with pitchblende and other uranium
minerals, or with ores of silver, tin and iron; it sometimes coats
joint-planes in gneiss and pegmatite. Falkenstein in Saxony, St Symphorien
near Autun (hence the name of the species), and St Day in Cornwall are
well-known localities for this mineral.
