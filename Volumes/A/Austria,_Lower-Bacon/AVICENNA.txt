AVICENNA [Ab[=u] `Al[=i] al-Husain ibn `Abdall[=a]h ibn S[=i]n[=a]]
(980-1037), Arabian philosopher, was born at Afshena in the district of
Bokhara. His mother was a native of the place; his father, a Persian from
Balkh, filled the post of tax-collector in the neighbouring town of
Harmaitin, under N[=u]h II. ibn Mansur, the Samanid amir of Bokhara. On the
birth of Avicenna's younger brother the family migrated to Bokhara, then
one of the chief cities of the Moslem world, and famous for a culture which
was older than its conquest by the Saracens. Avicenna was put in charge of
a tutor, and his precocity soon made him the marvel of his neighbours,--as
a boy of ten who knew by rote the Koran and much Arabic poetry besides.
From a greengrocer he learnt arithmetic; and higher branches were begun
under one of those wandering scholars who gained a livelihood by cures for
the sick and lessons for the young. Under him Avicenna read the _Isagoge_
of Porphyry and the first propositions of Euclid. But the pupil soon found
his teacher to be but a charlatan, and betook himself, aided by
commentaries, to master logic, geometry and the Almagest. Before he was
sixteen he not merely knew medical theory, but by gratuitous attendance on
the sick had, according to his own account, discovered new methods of
treatment. For the next year and a half he worked at the higher philosophy,
in which he encountered greater obstacles. In such moments of baffled
inquiry he would leave his books, perform the requisite ablutions, then hie
to the mosque, and continue in prayer till light broke on his difficulties.
Deep into the night he would continue his studies, stimulating his senses
by occasional cups of wine, and even in his dreams problems would pursue
him and work out their solution. Forty times, it is said, he read through
the _Metaphysics_ of Aristotle, till the words were imprinted on his
memory; but their meaning was hopelessly obscure, until one day they found
illumination from the little commentary by F[=a]r[=a]b[=i] (_q.v._), which
he bought at a bookstall for the small sum of three dirhems. So great was
his joy at the discovery, thus made by help of a work from which he had
expected only mystery, that he hastened to return thanks to God, and
bestowed an alms upon the poor. Thus, by the end of his seventeenth year
his apprenticeship of study was concluded, and he went forth to find a
market for his accomplishments.

His first appointment was that of physician to the amir, who owed him his
recovery from a dangerous illness (997). Avicenna's chief reward for this
service was access to the royal library of the Samanids (_q.v._),
well-known patrons of scholarship and scholars. When the library was
destroyed by fire not long after, the enemies of Avicenna accused him of
burning it, in order for ever to conceal the sources of his knowledge.
Meanwhile, he assisted his father in his financial labours, but still found
time to write some of his earliest works.

At the age of twenty-two Avicenna lost his father. The Samanid dynasty came
to its end in December 1004. Avicenna seems to have declined the offers of
Mahm[=u]d the Ghaznevid, and proceeded westwards to Urjensh in the modern
Khiva, where the vizier, regarded as a friend of scholars, gave him a small
monthly stipend. But the pay was small, and Avicenna wandered from place to
place through the districts of Nishapur and Merv to the borders of
Khorasan, seeking an opening for his talents. Shams al-Ma`[=a]l[=i]
Q[=a]b[=u]s, the generous ruler of Dailam, himself a poet and a scholar,
with whom he had expected to find an asylum, was about that date (1012)
starved to death by his own revolted soldiery. Avicenna himself was at this
season stricken down by a severe illness. Finally, at Jorj[=a]n, near the
Caspian, he met with a friend, who bought near his own house a dwelling in
which Avicenna lectured on logic and astronomy. For this patron several of
his treatises were written; and the commencement of his _Canon of Medicine_
also dates from his stay in Hyrcania.

He subsequently settled at Rai, in the vicinity of the modern Teheran,
where a son of the last amir, Majd Addaula, was nominal ruler, under the
regency of his mother. At Rai about thirty of his shorter works are said to
have been composed. But the constant feuds which raged between the regent
and her second son, Shams Addaula, compelled the scholar to quit the place,
and after a brief sojourn at Kazw[=i]n, he passed southwards to Hamad[=a]n,
where that prince had established himself. At first he entered into the
service of a high-born lady; but ere long the amir, hearing of his arrival,
called him in as medical attendant, and sent him back with presents to his
dwelling. Avicenna was even raised to the office of vizier; but the
turbulent soldiery, composed of Kurds and Turks, mutinied against their
nominal sovereign, and demanded that the new vizier should be put to death.
Shams Addaula consented that he should be banished from the country.
Avicenna, however, remained hidden for forty days in a sheik's house, till
a fresh attack of illness induced the amir to restore him to his post. Even
during this perturbed time he prosecuted his studies and teaching. Every
evening extracts from his great works, the _Canon_ and the _Sanatio_, were
dictated and explained to his pupils; among whom, when the lesson was over,
he spent the rest of the night in festive enjoyment with a band of singers
and players. On the death of the amir Avicenna ceased to be vizier, and hid
himself in the house of an apothecary, where, with intense assiduity, he
continued the composition of his works. Meanwhile, he had written to Abu
Ya`far, the prefect of Isfahan, offering his services; but the new amir of
Hamad[=a]n getting to hear of this correspondence, and discovering the
place of Avicenna's concealment, incarcerated him in a fortress. War
meanwhile continued between the rulers of Isfahan and Hamad[=a]n; in 1024
the former captured Hamad[=a]n and its towns, and expelled the Turkish
mercenaries. When the storm had passed Avicenna returned with the amir to
Hamad[=a]n, and carried on his literary labours; but at length, accompanied
by his brother, a favourite pupil, and two slaves, made his escape out of
the city in the dress of a Sufite ascetic. After a perilous journey they
reached Isfahan, and received an honourable welcome from the prince. The
remaining ten or twelve years of Avicenna's life were spent in the service
of Abu Ya`far `Al[=a] Addaula, whom he accompanied as physician and general
literary and scientific adviser, even in his numerous campaigns. During
these years he began to study literary matters and philology, instigated,
it is asserted, by [v.03 p.0063] criticisms on his style. But amid his
restless study Avicenna never forgot his love of enjoyment. Unusual bodily
vigour enabled him to combine severe devotion to work with facile
indulgence in sensual pleasures. His passion for wine and women was almost
as well known as his learning. Versatile, light-hearted, boastful and
pleasure-loving, he contrasts with the nobler and more intellectual
character of Averroes. His bouts of pleasure gradually weakened his
constitution; a severe colic, which seized him on the march of the army
against Hamad[=a]n, was checked by remedies so violent that Avicenna could
scarcely stand. On a similar occasion the disease returned; with difficulty
he reached Hamad[=a]n, where, finding the disease gaining ground, he
refused to keep up the regimen imposed, and resigned himself to his fate.
On his deathbed remorse seized him; he bestowed his goods on the poor,
restored unjust gains, freed his slaves, and every third day till his death
listened to the reading of the Koran. He died in June 1037, in his
fifty-eighth year, and was buried in Hamad[=a]n.

It was mainly accident which determined that from the 12th to the 17th
century Avicenna should be the guide of medical study in European
universities, and eclipse the names of Rhazes, Ali ibn al-Abbas and
Avenzoar. His work is not essentially different from that of his
predecessors Rhazes and Ali; all present the doctrine of Galen, and through
Galen the doctrine of Hippocrates, modified by the system of Aristotle. But
the _Canon_ of Avicenna is distinguished from the _Al-Hawi_ (_Continens_)
or _Summary_ of Rhazes by its greater method, due perhaps to the logical
studies of the former, and entitling him to his surname of Prince of the
Physicians. The work has been variously appreciated in subsequent ages,
some regarding it as a treasury of wisdom, and others, like Avenzoar,
holding it useful only as waste paper. In modern times it has been more
criticized than read. The vice of the book is excessive classification of
bodily faculties, and over-subtlety in the discrimination of diseases. It
includes five books; of which the first and second treat of physiology,
pathology and hygiene, the third and fourth deal with the methods of
treating disease, and the fifth describes the composition and preparation
of remedies. This last part contains some contingent of personal
observation. He is, like all his countrymen, ample in the enumeration of
symptoms, and is said to be inferior to Ali in practical medicine and
surgery. He introduced into medical theory the four causes of the
Peripatetic system. Of natural history and botany he pretends to no special
knowledge. Up to the year 1650, or thereabouts, the _Canon_ was still used
as a text-book in the universities of Louvain and Montpellier.

About 100 treatises are ascribed to Avicenna. Some of them are tracts of a
few pages, others are works extending through several volumes. The
best-known amongst them, and that to which Avicenna owed his European
reputation, is the _Canon of Medicine_; an Arabic edition of it appeared at
Rome in 1593, and a Hebrew version at Naples in 1491. Of the Latin version
there were about thirty editions, founded on the original translation by
Gerard of Cremona. The 15th century has the honour of composing the great
commentary on the text of the _Canon_, grouping around it all that theory
had imagined, and all that practice had observed. Other medical works
translated into Latin are the _Medicamenta Cordialia_, _Canticum de
Medicina_, _Tractatus de Syrupo Acetoso_. Scarcely any member of the
Arabian circle of the sciences, including theology, philology, mathematics,
astronomy, physics and music, was left untouched by the treatises of
Avicenna, many of which probably varied little, except in being
commissioned by a different patron and having a different form or extent.
He wrote at least one treatise on alchemy, but several others have been
falsely attributed to him. His book on animals was translated by Michael
Scot. His _Logic_, _Metaphysics_, _Physics_, _De Caelo_, are treatises
giving a synoptic view of Aristotelian doctrine. The _Logic_ and
_Metaphysics_ have been printed more than once, the latter, _e.g._, at
Venice in 1493, 1495 and 1546. Some of his shorter essays on medicine,
logic, &c., take a poetical form (the poem on logic was published by
Schmoelders in 1836). Two encyclopaedic treatises, dealing with philosophy,
are often mentioned. The larger, _Al-Shif[=a]'_ (_Sanatio_), exists nearly
complete in manuscript in the Bodleian library and elsewhere; part of it on
the _De Anima_ appeared at Pavia (1490) as the _Liber Sextus Naturalium_,
and the long account of Avicenna's philosophy given by Shahrastani seems to
be mainly an analysis, and in many places a reproduction, of the
_Al-Shif[=a]'_, A shorter form of the work is known as the _An-naj[=a]t_
(_Liberatio_). The Latin editions of part of these works have been modified
by the corrections which the monkish editors confess that they applied.
There is also a _Philosophia Orientalis_, mentioned by Roger Bacon, and now
lost, which according to Averroes was pantheistic in tone.
