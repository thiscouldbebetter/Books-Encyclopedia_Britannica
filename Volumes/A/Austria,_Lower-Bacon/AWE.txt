AWE, LOCH, the longest freshwater lake in Scotland, situated in
mid-Argyllshire, 116 ft. above the sea, with an area of nearly 16 sq. m. It
has a N.E. to S.W. direction and is fully 23 m. long from Kilchurn Castle
to Ford, its breadth varying from 1/3 of a mile to 3 m. at its upper end,
where it takes the shape of a crescent, one arm of which runs towards Glen
Orchy, the other to the point where the river Awe leaves the lake. The two
ends of the loch are wholly dissimilar in character, the scenery of the
upper extremity being majestic, while that of the lower half is pastoral
and tame. Of its numerous islands the best-known is Inishail, containing
ruins of a church and convent, which was suppressed at the Reformation. At
the extreme north-eastern end of the lake, on an islet which, when the
water is low, becomes part of the mainland, stand the imposing ruins of
Kilchurn Castle. Its romantic surroundings have made this castle a
favourite subject of the landscape painter. Dalmally, about 2 m. from the
loch, is one of the pleasantest villages in the Highlands and has a great
vogue in midsummer. The river Awe, issuing from the north-western horn of
the loch, affords excellent trout and salmon fishing.
