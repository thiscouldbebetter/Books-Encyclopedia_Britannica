AUTOCHTHONES (Gr. [Greek: autos], and [Greek: chthôn], earth, _i.e._ people
sprung from earth itself; Lat. _terrigenae_; see also under ABORIGINES),
the original inhabitants of a country as opposed to settlers, and those of
their descendants who kept themselves free from an admixture of foreign
peoples. The practice in ancient Greece of describing legendary heroes and
men of ancient lineage as "earthborn" greatly strengthened the doctrine of
autochthony; for instance, the Athenians wore golden grasshoppers in their
hair in token that they were born from the soil and had always lived in
Attica (Thucydides i. 6; Plato, _Menexenus_, 245). In Thebes, the race of
Sparti were believed to have sprung from a field sown with dragons' teeth.
The Phrygian Corybantes had been forced out of the hill-side like trees by
Rhea, the great mother, and hence were called [Greek: dendrophueis]. It is
clear from Aeschylus (_Prometheus_, 447) that primitive men were supposed
to have at first lived like animals in caves and woods, till by the help of
the gods and heroes they were raised to a stage of civilization.
