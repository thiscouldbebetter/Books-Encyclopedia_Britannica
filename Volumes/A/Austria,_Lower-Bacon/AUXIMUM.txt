AUXIMUM (mod. _Osimo_), an ancient town in Picenum, situated on an isolated
hill 8 m. from the Adriatic, on the road from Ancona to Nuceria. It was
selected by the Romans as a fortress to protect their settlements in
northern Picenum, and strongly fortified in 174 B.C. The walls erected at
that period, of large rectangular blocks of stone, still exist in great
part. Auximum became a colony at latest in 157 B.C. It often appears in the
history of the civil wars, owing to its strong position. Pompey was its
patron, and intended that Caesar should find resistance here in 49 B.C. It
appears to have been a place of some importance in imperial times, as
inscriptions and the monuments of its forum (the present piazza) show. In
the 6th century it is called by Procopius the chief town of Picenum, Ancona
being spoken of as its harbour.
