AY, AYE. The word "aye," meaning _always_ (and pronounced as in "day";
connected with Gr. [Greek: aei], always, and Lat. _aevum_, an age), is
often spelt "ay," and the _New English Dictionary_ prefers this. "Aye,"
meaning Yes (and pronounced almost like the word "eye"), though sometimes
identified with "yea," is probably the same word etymologically, though
differentiated by usage; the form "ay" for this is also common, but
inconvenient; at one time it was spelt simply _I_ (_e.g._ in Michael
Drayton's _Idea_, 57; published in 1593).
