AVENARIUS, RICHARD HEINRICH LUDWIG (1843-1896), German philosopher, was
born in Paris on the 19th of November 1843. His education, begun in Zürich
and Berlin, was completed at the university of Leipzig, where he graduated
in 1876. In 1877 he became professor of philosophy in Zürich, where he died
on the 18th of August 1896. At Leipzig he was one of the founders of the
_Akademisch-philosophische Verein_, and was the first editor of the
_Vierteljahrsschrift für wissenschaftliche Philosophie_. In 1868 he
published an essay on the Pantheism of Spinoza. His chief works are
_Philosophie als Denken der Welt gemäss dem Princip des kleinsten
Kraftmasses_ (1876) and the _Kritik der reinen Erfahrung_ (1888-1890). In
these works he made an attempt to co-ordinate thought and action. Like
Mach, he started from the principle of economy of thinking, and in the
_Kritik_ endeavoured to explain pure experience in relation to knowledge
and environment. He discovers that statements dependent upon environment
constitute pure experience. This philosophy, called Empirio-criticism, is
not, however, a realistic but an idealistic dualism, nor can it be called
materialism.
