AWAJI, an island belonging to Japan, situated at the eastern entrance of
the Inland Sea, having a length of 32 m., an extreme breadth of 16 m., and
an area of 218 sq. m., with a population of about 190,000. It is separated
on the south from the island of Shikoku by the Naruto channel, through
which, in certain conditions of the tide, a remarkable torrential current
is set up. The island is celebrated for its exquisite scenery, and also for
the fact that it is traditionally reputed to have been the first of the
Japanese islands created by the deities Izanagi and Izanami. The loftiest
peak is Yuruuba-yama (1998 ft.), the most picturesque Sen-zan (1519 ft.).
Awaji is noted for a peculiar manufacture of pottery.
