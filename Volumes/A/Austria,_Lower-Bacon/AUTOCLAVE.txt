AUTOCLAVE, a strong closed vessel of metal in which liquids can be heated
above their boiling points under pressure. Etymologically the word
indicates a self-closing vessel ([Greek: autos], self, and _clavis_, key,
or _clavus_, nail), in which the tightness of the joints is maintained by
the internal pressure, but this characteristic is frequently wanting in the
actual apparatus to which the name is applied. The prototype of the
autoclave was the digester of Denis Papin, invented in 1681, which is still
used in cooking, but the appliance finds a much wider range of employment
in chemical industry, where it is utilized in various forms in the
manufacture of candles, coal-tar colours, &c. Frequently an agitator,
passing through a stuffing-box, is fitted so that the contents may be
stirred, and renewable linings are provided in cases where the substances
under treatment exert a corrosive action on metal.
