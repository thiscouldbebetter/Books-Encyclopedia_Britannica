AYMARA (anc. _Colla_), a tribe of South American Indians, formerly
inhabiting the country around Lake Titicaca and the neighbouring valleys of
the Andes. They form now the chief ethnical element in Bolivia, but are of
very mixed blood. In early days the home of the Aymaras by Lake Titicaca
was a "holy land" for the Incas themselves, whose national legends
attributed the origin of all Quichua (Inca) civilization to that region.
The Aymaras, indeed, seem to have possessed a very considerable culture
before their conquest by the Incas in the 13th and 14th centuries, evidence
of which remains in the megalithic ruins of Tiahuanaco. When the Spaniards
arrived the Aymaras had been long under the Inca domination, and were in a
decadent state. They, however, retained certain privileges, such as the use
of their own language; and their treatment by their conquerors generally
suggested that the latter believed themselves of Aymara blood. Physically,
the pure Aymara is short and thick-set, with a great chest development, and
with the same reddish complexion, broad face, black eyes and rounded
forehead which distinguish the Quichuas. Like the latter, too, the Aymaras
are sullen and apathetic in disposition. They number now, including
half-breeds, about half a million in Bolivia. Some few are also found in
southern Peru.
