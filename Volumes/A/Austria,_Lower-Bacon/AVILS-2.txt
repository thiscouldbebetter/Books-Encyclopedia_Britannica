AVILÉS, or SAN NICOLÁS DE AVILÉS (the Roman _Flavionavia_), a seaport of
northern Spain, in the province of Oviedo; on the Bay of Avilés, a winding
inlet of the Bay of Biscay, 24 m. by rail W. of Gijón. Pop. (1900) 12,763.
Avilés is a picturesque and old-fashioned town, containing several ancient
palaces and Gothic churches. The bay, which is crossed by a fine bridge at
its narrow landward extremity, is the headquarters of a fishing fleet, and
a port of call for many coasting vessels. Coal from the Oviedo mines is
exported coastwise, and in 1904 the shipments from Avilés for the first
time exceeded those from Gijón, reaching a total of more than 290,000 tons.
Glass and coarse linen and woollen stuffs are manufactured; and there are
valuable stone quarries in the neighbourhood.
