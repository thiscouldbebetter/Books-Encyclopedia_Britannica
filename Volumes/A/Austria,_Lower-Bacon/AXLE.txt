AXLE (in Mid. Eng. _axel-tre_, from O. Norweg. _öxull-tre_, cognate with
the O. Eng. _æxe_ or _eaxe_, and connected with Sansk. _áksha_, Gr. [Greek:
axôn], and Lat. _axis_), the pin or spindle on which a wheel turns. In
carriages the axle-tree is the bar on which the wheels are mounted, the
axles being strictly its thinner rounded prolongations on which they
actually turn. The pins which pass through the ends of the axles and keep
the wheels from slipping off are known as axle-pins or "linch-pins,"
"linch" being a corruption, due to confusion with "link," of the Old
English word for "axle," _lynis_, cf. Ger. _Lünse_.
