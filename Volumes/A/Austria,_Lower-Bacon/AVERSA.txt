AVERSA, a town and episcopal see of Campania, Italy, in the province of
Caserta, 15½ m. S.S.W. by rail from Caserta, and 12½ m. N. by rail from
Naples, from which there is also an electric tramway. Pop. (1901) 23,477.
Aversa was the first place in which the Normans settled, it being granted
to them in 1027 for the help which they had given to Duke Sergius of Naples
against Pandulf IV. of Capua. The Benedictine abbey of S. Lorenzo preserves
a portal of the 11th century. There is also a large lunatic asylum, founded
by Joachim Murat in 1813.
