AVARS, or AVARI, an East Caucasian people, the most renowned of the
Lesghian tribes, inhabiting central Daghestan (see LESGHIANS). They are the
only Lesghian tribe who possess a written language, for which they make use
of the Arabic characters. They are often confused with the Avars whose
empire on the Danube was broken by Charlemagne; but Komarov asserts that
they are of more recent origin as a tribe, their name being Lowland Turki
for "vagrant" or "refugee."
