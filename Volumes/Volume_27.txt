TONALITE, in petrology, a rock of the diorite class, first 
described from Monte Adamello near Tonale in the Eastern 
Alps. It may be described as a quartz-diorite containing 
biotite and hornblende in nearly equal proportions. The prin- 
cipal felspar is plagioclase, but orthoclase occurs also, usually 
in small amount. Those varieties which are rich in orthoclase, 
in addition to plagioclase, have been called quartz-monzonites 
or adamellites, but a better term is grano-diorite, which has 
been very generally adopted in America for rocks which are 
intermediate in character between the granites and the diorites. 
The hornblende of the diorites is green, sometimes with a tinge 
of brown; the biotite is always brown and strongly pleochroic. 
Often these two minerals are clustered together irregularly or in 
parallel growths. They have generally a fairly strong tendency 
to idiomorphism, but may sometimes enclose plagioclase fel- 
spar in ophitic manner. Both of them decompose to chlorite, 
epidote and carbonates. The plagioclase felspar, which may 
form more than one-half of the rock, is andesine or oligoclase; 
simple crystals are rare, the majority being complex growths 
with centres of felspar rich in lime, while in the external zones the 
proportion of soda felspar increases greatly. The inner portions 
have often well-defined, but very irregular, boundaries, and are 
sometimes sponge-like, with the cavities filled up with a later, 
more acid, deposit. This seems to indicate that growth has 
taken place in stages, alternating with periods when the 
crystallized felspar was eroded or partly dissolved. The ortho- 
clase sometimes forms irregular plates enclosing individuals 
of plagioclase. Quartz occurs both in irregular simple grains 
and as micropegmatite. Occasionally pale green pyroxene is 
visible in the centre of crystals of dark green hornblende. The 
accessory minerals apatite, magnetite and zircon are always 
present, and very common also are orthite in coffee-coloured 
zonal prisms practically always encircled by yellow epidote, 
and reddish-brown crystals of sphene, simple or twinned. 

In external appearance the tonalites are very like the granites 
but usually darker in colour. Tonalite-porphyrites often accom- 
pany them, having the same composition but with^ phenocrysts 
of felspar, quartz, hornblende and biotite in a fine-grained ground- 
mass. Veins and threads of fine grey rock, mainly composed of 
quartz and felspar, often intersect tonalite-masses and have been 
called tonalite-aplites, seeing that they bear the same relations to 
aplites as the aplites do to the granites. They contain more soda- 
lime felspar than the normal ^ aplites. Towards their margins 
the^ larger alpine masses of tonalite often assume banded or gneissic 
facies, due apparently to movement during intrusion.

In eastern Tirol another tonalite occurs at Rieserferner; there 
is also a well-known mass of this rock near Traversella. In the south 
of Scotland (Galloway district) tonalites accompany hornblende- 
and biotite-granites, hornblende- and augite-diorites. The newer 
granites of the Highlands of Scotland in many places pass into 
tonalites, especially near their margins, and similar rocks occur in 
Ireland in a few places. Grano-diorites have been described from 
California, and rocks of very similar character occur in the Andes, 
Patagonia and the lesser Antilles. Tonalites are also said to be 
frequent among the igneous rocks of Alaska. (J. S. F.) 

TONAWANDA, a city of Erie county, New York, U.S.A., 
about ii m. by rail N. of Buffalo on the Niagara River at the 
mouth of Tonawanda Creek (opposite North Tonawanda), 
and on the Erie Canal. Pop. (1900), 7421, of whom 1834 were 
foreign-born; (1010 census), 8290. Tonawanda is served 
by the New York Central & Hudson River and the Erie railways, 
and is connected with Buffalo, Niagara Falls and Lockport by 
electric lines. The industries depend chiefly on electric power 
generated by the Niagara Falls, 11 m. distant. There are rolling- 
mills, planing-mills, ship-yards, and blast-furnaces, and among 
the manufactures are wooden ware, flour and paper. The 
surrounding region was the scene of hostilities during the Seven 
Years' War, and the War of 1812. The first permanent white 
settlement was made about 1809, and Tonawanda was in- 
corporated as a village in 1854 and was chartered as a city in 
1903. The name of the city is an Indian word said to mean 
" swift water." 

TONBRIDGE [Ttjnbridge], a market town in the Tonbridge 
or south-western parliamentary division of Kent, England, 
29^ m. S.S.E. of London by the South Eastern & Chatham 
railway. Pop. of urban district (1901), 12,736. It is situated 
on rising ground above the river Medway, which is crossed by a 
stone bridge erected in 1775. The church of St Peter and St 
Paul, chiefly Decorated and Perpendicular, with some portions 
of earlier date, was completely restored in 1879. There are 
remains of an ancient castle, consisting chiefly of a finely pre- 
served gateway, of the Early Decorated period, flanked by two 
round towers. The castle was formerly defended by three 
moats, one of them formed by the Medway. Tonbridge School 
was founded by Sir Andrew Judd, lord mayor of London in 
the time of Edward VI., and was rebuilt in 1865, remodelled 
in 1880, and extended subsequently. Ornamental articles of 
inlaid wood, called Tonbridge ware, chiefly sold at Tunbridge 
Wells, are largely manufactured. There are gunpowder mills 
on the banks of the Medway, and wool-stapling, brewing and 



TONDERN— TONE 



tanning are carried on. There is some traffic on the Medway, 
which is navigable for barges. 

Tonbridge owed its early importance to the castle built by 
Richard, earl of Clare, in the reign of Henry I. The castle 
was besieged by William Rufus, was taken by John in the wars 
with the barons, and again by Prince Edward, son of Henry III. 
After being in the possession of the carls of Clare and Hert- 
ford, and of the earls of Gloucester, it became the property of 
the Staffords, and on the attainder of the duke of Bucking- 
ham in the reign of Henry VIII. was taken by the Crown. It 
was dismantled during the Civil War. The lords of the castle 
had the right of attending the archbishops of Canterbury on 
state occasions as chief butlers. 

TONDERN, a town of Germany, in the Prussian province of 
Schleswig-Holstein, on the Widane, 8 m. from the North Sea at 
Hoyer, opposite the island of Sylt, and 42 m. by rail N.W. from 
Flensburg. Pop. (1900), 4244. Tondern was in early days a 
seaport, but since the reclamation of the marshes and the dredg- 
ing of the Widane navigation has ceased, and vessels load and 
unload at Hoyer, with which the place has direct railway com- 
munication. The trade consists chiefly in agricultural produce 
and cattle, and there is an important horse market. 

In the village of Galhus, lying about 4 m. N., were discovered, 
in 1639 and 1734 respectively, two golden horns of the Scandi- 
navian period; these were stolen in 1802 from the Museum of 
Northern Antiquities in Copenhagen, where they had been 
treasured, and have never heen recovered.

TONE, THEOBALD WOLFE (1 763-1 798), Irish rebel, the 
son of Peter Tone, a Dublin coachmaker, was born in Duhlin 
on the 20th of June 1763. His grandfather was a small 
farmer in county Kildare, and his mother was the daughter of 
a captain in the merchant service. Though entered as a student 
at Trinity College, Dublin, Tone gave little attention to study, 
his inclination being for a military career; but after eloping 
with'Matilda Witherington, a girl of sixteen, he took his degree 
in 1786, and read law in London at the Middle Temple and after- 
wards in Dublin, being called to the Irish bar in 1789. Though 
idle, Tone had considerable ability. Chagrined at finding no 
notice taken of a wild scheme for founding a military colony 
in the South Seas which he had submitted to Pitt, he turned to 
Irish politics. An able pamphlet attacking the administration 
of the marquess of Buckingham in 1790 brought him to the 
notice of the Whig club; and in September 1791 he wrote a 
remarkable essay over the signature " A Northern Whig," of 
which 10,000 copies are said to have been sold. The principles 
of the French Revolution were at this time heing eagerly em- 
braced in Ireland, especially among the Preshyterians of Ulster, 
and two months hefore the appearance of Tone's essay a great 
meeting had been held in Belfast, where republican toasts 
had heen drunk with enthusiasm, and a resolution in favour 
of the abolition of religious disqualifications had given the first 
sign of political sympathy between the Roman Catholics and 
the Protestant dissenters of the north. The essay of " A 
Northern Whig " emphasized the growing breach between the 
Whig patriots like Flood and Grattan, who aimed at Catholic 
emancipation and parliamentary reform without disloyalty 
to the connexion with England, and the men who desired td 
establish a separate Irish republic. Tone expressed in his 
pamphlet unqualified contempt for the constitution which 
Grattan had so triumphantly extorted from the English govern- 
ment in 1782; and, himself a Protestant, he urged co-operation 
hetween the different religious sects in Ireland as the only 
means of ohtaining complete redress of Irish grievances. 

In October 1791 Tone converted these ideas into practical 
policy by founding, in conjunction with Thomas Russell (1767- 
1803), Napper Tandy (q.v.) and others, the society of the " United 
Irishmen." The original purpose of this society was no more 
than the formation of a political union between Roman Catholics 
and Protestants, with a view to obtaining a liberal measure of 
parliamentary reform; it was only when that object appeared 
to be unattainable by constitutional methods that the majority 



of the members adopted the more uncompromising opinions which 
Wolfe Tone held from the first, and conspired to establish an 
Irish republic by armed rebellion. Tone himself admitted 
that with him hatred of England had always been " rather an 
instinct than a principle," though until his views should become 
more generally accepted in Ireland he was prepared to work 
for reform as distinguished from revolution. But he desired 
to root out the popular respect for the names of Charlemont 
and Grattan, and to transfer to more violent leaders the conduct 
of the national movement. Grattan was a reformer and a 
patriot without a tincture of democratic ideas; Wolfe Tone was 
a revolutionary whose principles were drawn from the French 
Convention. Grattan's political philosophy was allied to that 
of Edmund Burke; Tone was a disciple of Danton and Thomas 
Paine. 

Democratic principles were gaining ground among the Roman 
Catholics as well as the Presbyterians. A quarrel between the 
moderate and the more advanced sections of the Roman Catholic 
Committee led, in December 1791, to the secession of sixty-eight 
of the former, led by Lord Kenmare; and the direction of the 
committee then passed to more violent leaders, of whom the 
most prominent was John'Keogh, a Dublin tradesman. The 
active participation of the Roman Catholics in the movement 
of the United Irishmen was strengthened by the appointment 
of Tone as paid secretary of the Roman Catholic Committee in 
the spring of 1792. When the legality of the Roman Catholic 
Convention in 1792 was called in question by the government, 
Tone drew up for the committee a statement of the case on which 
a favourable opinion ;of counsel was obtained; and a sum of 
£1500 with a gold medal was voted to Tone hy the Convention 
when it dissolved itself in April 1793. Burke and Grattan were 
anxious that provision should be made for the education of 
Irish Roman Catholic priests at home, to preserve them from 
the contagion of Jacobinism in France; Wolfe Tone, " with an 
incomparably juster forecast," as Lecky observes, " advocated 
the same measure for exactly opposite reasons." He rejoiced 
that the breaking up of the French schools by the revolution 
had rendered necessary the foundation of Maynooth College, 
which he foresaw would draw the sympathies of the clergy into 
more democratic channels. In 1794 the United Irishmen, 
persuaded that their scheme of universal suffrage and equal 
electoral districts was not likely to he accepted by any party in 
the Irish parliament, hegan to found their hopes on a French 
invasion. . An English clergyman named William Jackson, a 
man of infamous notoriety who had long lived in France, where 
he had imbibed revolutionary opinions, came to Ireland to 
nogotiate between the French committee of public safety and 
the United Irishmen. For this emissary Tone drew up a 
memorandum on the state of Ireland, which he described as 
ripe for revolution; the paper was betrayed to the government 
by an attorney named Cockayne to whom Jackson had impru- 
dently disclosed his mission; and in April 1794 Jackson was 
arrested on a charge of treason. Several of the leading United 
Irishmen, including Reynolds and Hamilton Rowan, immediately 
fled the country; the papers of the United Irishmen were seized; 
and for a time the organization was broken up. Tone, who had 
not attended meetings of the society since May 1793, remained 
in Ireland till after the trial and suicide of Jackson in April 
1795. Having friends among the government party, including 
members of the Beresford family, he was enabled to make terms 
with the government, and in return for information as to what 
had passed between Jackson, Rowan and himself he was per- 
mitted to emigrate to America, where he arrived in May 1795. 
Taking up his residence at Philadelphia, he wrote a few months 
later to Thomas Russell expressing unqualified dislike of the 
American people, whom he was disappointed to find no more 
truly democratic in sentiment and no less attached to order and 
authority than the English; he descrihed George Washington 
as a " high-flying aristocrat," and he found the aristocracy of 
money in America still less to his liking than the European 
aristocracy of birth. 

Tone did not feel himself bound in honour by his compact

with the government at home to abstain from further conspiracy; 
and finding himself at Philadelphia in the congenial company 
of Reynolds, Rowan and Napper Tandy, he undertook a mission 
to Paris to persuade the French government to send an expedi- 
tion to invade Ireland. In February 1796 he arrived in Paris 
and had interviews with De La Croix and L. N. M. Carnot, who 
were greatly impressed by his energy, sincerity and ability. A 
commission was given him as adjutant-general in the French 
army, which he hoped might protect him from the penalty of 
treason in the event of capture by the English; though he himself 
claimed the authorship of a proclamation said to have heen issued 
by the United Irishmen, enjoining that all Irishmen taken with 
arms in their hands in the British service should be instantly 
shot; and he supported a project for landing a thousand criminals 
in England, who were to be commissioned to burn Bristol and 
commit any other atrocity in their power. He drew up two 
memorials representing that the landing of a considerable 
French force in Ireland would be followed by a general rising 
of the people, and giving a detailed account of the condition of 
the country. The French directory, which possessed informa- 
tion from Lord Edward Fitzgerald (q.v.) and Arthur O'Connor 
confirming Tone, prepared to despatch an expedition under 
Hoche. On the 15th of December 1796 the expedition, consist- 
ing of forty-three sail and carrying about 15,000 men with a 
large supply of war material for distribution in Ireland, sailed 
from Brest. Tone, who accompanied it as " Adjutant-general 
Smith," had the greatest contempt for the seamanship of the 
French sailors, which was amply justified by the disastrous 
result of the invasion. Returning to France without having 
effected anything, Tone served for some months in the French 
army under Hoche; and in June 1797 he took part in prepara- 
tions for a Dutch expedition to Ireland, which was to be sup- 
ported by the French. But the Dutch fleet was detained in the 
Texel for many weeks by unfavourable weather, and before it 
eventually put to sea in October, only to be crushed by Duncan 
in the battle of Camperdown, Tone had returned to Paris; and 
Hoche, the chief hope of the United Irishmen, was dead. Bona- 
parte, with whom Tone had several interviews about this time, 
was much less disposed than Hoche had been to undertake in 
earnest an Irish expedition; and when the rebellion broke out 
in Ireland in 1798 he had started for Egypt. When, therefore, 
Tone urged the directory to send effective assistance to the Irish 
rebels, all that could be promised was a number of small raids 
to descend simultaneously on different points of the Irish coast. 
One of these under Humbert succeeded in landing a force in 
Killala Bay, and gained some success in Connaught before it was 
subdued by Lake and Cornwallis, Wolfe Tone's brother Matthew 
being captured, tried by court-martial, and hanged; a second, 
accompanied by Napper Tandy (q.v.), came to disaster on the 
coast of Donegal; while Wolfe Tone took part in a third, under 
Admiral Bompard, with General Hardy in command of a force 
of about 3000 men, which encountered an English squadron 
near Lough Swilly on the 12th of October 1798. Tone, who was 
on board the " Hoche," refused Bompard's offer of escape in a 
frigate before the action, and was taken prisoner when the 
" Hoche " was forced to surrender. When the prisoners were 
landed a fortnight later Sir George Hill recognized Tone in the 
French adjutant-general's uniform. At his trial by court-martial 
in Dublin, Tone made a manly straightforward speech, avowing 
his determined hostility to England and his design " by fair and 
open war to procure the separation of the two countries," and 
pleading in virtue of his status as a French officer to die by the 
musket instead of the rope. He was, however, sentenced to be 
hanged on the 12th of November; but on the nth he cut his 
throat with a penknife, and on the 19th of November 1798 he 
died of the wound. 

Although Wolfe Tone had none of the attributes of greatness, 
" he rises," says Lecky, "far above the dreary level of common- 
place which Irish conspiracy in general presents. The tawdry 
and exaggerated rhetoric; the petty vanity and jealousies; the 
weak sentimentalism; the utter incapacity for proportioning 
means to ends, and for grasping the stern realities of things, 



which so commonly disfigure the lives and conduct even of the 
more honest members of his class, were wholly alien to his nature. 
His judgment of men and things was keen, lucid and masculine, 
and he was alike prompt in decision and brave in action." In 
his later years he overcame the drunkenness that was habitual 
to him in youth; he developed seriousness of character and unsel- 
fish devotion to wbat he believed was the cause of patriotism; 
and he won the respect of men of high character and capacity 
in France and Holland. His journals, which were written for 
his family and intimate friends, give a singularly interesting 
and vivid picture of life in Paris in the time of the directory. 
They were published after his death by his son, William Theobald 
Wolfe Tone (1791-1828), who was educated by the French 
government and served with some distinction in the armies of 
Napoleon, emigrating after Waterloo to America, where he died, 
in New York City, on the 10th of October 1828.

TONGA, or Friendly Islands (so called by Captain Cook), 
an archipelago in the South Pacific Ocean, about 350 m. S.S.W. 
of Samoa and 250 m. E.S.E. of Fiji. The long chain of islands, 
numbering about 150, though with a collective land area of 
only 385 sq. m., extends from 18 5' to 22 29' S. and 174 to 
176 io' W., and is broken into three groups, viz. the Tonga to 
the south, Hapai (which again is divided into three clusters) in 
the centre and Vavau to the north.* The largest island is 
Tongatabu (the Sacred Tonga, Tasman's Amsterdam) in the 
southern group, measuring about 25 by 10 m., and 165 sq. m. 
in area, which contains the capital, Nukualofa. The vegetation 
is rich and beautiful, but the scenery tame, the land seldom rising 
above 60 ft.; Eua (Tasman's Middelburg), 9 m. south-east and 
67 sq. m. in area, is 1078 ft. in extreme height, and much more 
picturesque, being diversified by rocks and woods. Vavau, 
in the northern group, is 55 sq. m. in extent and 300 ft. high. 
Next to these come the coral islands Nomuka and Lifuka in 
the Hapai group; Tofua, 2846ft.,LateorLette, 1800 ft. and Kao, 
3020 ft. high, which are volcanic and smaller. The numerous 
islets of the central group are very fertile. It is along the western 
side of the northern half of the chain that tbe line of volcanic 
action is apparent; the islands here (of which some are active 
volcanoes) are lofty. To the east the whole chain is hounded 
by a profound trough in the ocean bed, which extends south- 
westward, east of the Kermadec Islands, towards New Zealand. 
The majority of the Tonga Islands, however, are level, averaging 
40 ft. high, with hills rising to 600 ft.; their sides are generally 
steep. The surface is covered with a rich mould unusual in 
coral islands, mixed towards the sea with sand, and having a 
substratum of red or blue clay. The soil is thus very productive, 
although water is scarce and bad. Barrier reefs are rare; 
fringing reefs are numerous, except on the east side, which is 
nearly free, and there are many small isolated reefs and volcanic 
banks among the islands. If the reefs impede navigation they 
form some good harbours. The best is on the south-western side 
of Vavau; another is on the north of Tongatabu. Earthquakes 
are not infrequent. From 1845 to 1857 volcanic eruptions were 
very violent, and islands once fertile were devastated and nearly 
destroyed. A new island rose from the sea, and was at once 
named " Wesley," but disappeared again. In 1886 there was 
a serious volcanic eruption in the outlying island of Niuafoou, 
and at the same time Falcon Reef, normally awash at high water, 
discharged sufficient scoriae and pumice to form a new island 
50 ft. high. In 1898 the island had been washed away, but in 
1900 H.M.S. " Porpoise " found that a solid core of black rock 
had been extruded 6 ft. above high water. All the volcanoes 
in the group were then quiescent. 

Geology. — The line of volcanic action extends along the western side 
of the northern half of the chain. Some of the islands are built of, 



TONGA 



volcanic rocks alone; such are Hongu-tonga and Hongu-hapai, which 
appear to be fragments of a single ancient crater, Tofua, Kao, Late, 
Metis, Amargua and Falcon Island. The lava is a basic augite- 
andesite. Another group of islands consistsof elevated masses of 
submarine volcanic deposits, upon some of which coral-reef limestone 
forms a more or less complete covering; such are Tonumeia and the 
Nomuka group (Mango, Tonua, Nomuka-iki). AH the volcanic rocks 
of these islands are submarine stratified tuffs which are penetrated 
hereand there by andcsite or diabase dikes. The Vavau group 
consists entirely of coral limestone, which is occasionally crystalline, 
and contains stalactitic caves of great Seauty. 

Climate, Flora, Fauna, — The climate is healthy for Europeans, 
being dry and cool as compared with that of Samoa and Fiji. There 
are frequent alternations of temperature, which averages 75 to 
77° F., though considerably higher in the wet season. Cool south- 
east trade winds blow, sometimes with great violence, from April 
to December. During the rest of the year the winds blow from 
west-north-west and north, with rain and occasional destructive 
hurricanes. A cyclone which devastated Vavau in April 1900 was the 
most destructive ever recorded in the group, but hurricanes are rare. 
The^ average rainfall for the year is about 80 ins. The vegetation 
is similar to that of Fiji, but more definitely Indo-Malayan in 
character; it embraces all the plants of the groups to the east with 
many that are absent there. Ferns abound*, some of them peculiar, 
and tree ferns on the higher islands, and all the usual fruit trees 
and cultivated plants of the Pacific are found. There are several 
kinds of valuable timber trees. The only indigenous land mammalia 
are a small rat and a few curious species of bats. The dog and the 
pig were no doubt introduced by man. Of birds some 30 kinds 
are known, an owl being the only bird of prey; parrots, pigeons, 
kingfishers, honey-suckers, rails, ducks, and other water birds are 
numerous. _ There are snakes and small lizards, but no frogs or 
toads. Of insects there are relatively few kinds; but ants, beetles 
and^ mosquitoes abound. The fishes, of an Indo-Malay type, are 
varied and numerous. Turtle and sea-snakes abound, as do mollusca, 
of which a few are peculiar, and zoophytes. 

Inhabitants. — The population of the archipelago is about 
19,000, of whom about- 370 are whites or half-castes. The 
natives, a branch of the Polynesian race, are the most progressive 
and most intellectual in the Pacific Islands, except the 
Hawaiians. They have exercised an influence over distant 
neighbours, especially in Fiji, quite out of proportion to their 
numbers. Their conquests have extended as far as Niu6, or 
Savage Island, 200 m. east, and to various other islands to the 
north. In Captain Cook's time Poulaho, the principal chief, 
considered Samoa to be within his dominions. This pre- 
eminence may perhaps be due to an early infusion of Fijian 
blood: it has been observed that such crosses are always more 
vigorous than the pure races in these islands; and this influence 
seems also traceable in the Tongan dialect, and appears to have 
been partially transmitted thence to the Samoan. Various 
customs, traditions and names of places also point to a former 
relation with Fiji. Their prior conversion to Christianity gave 
the Tongans material as well as moral advantages over their 
neighbours. Crime is infrequent, and morality, always above 
the Polynesian average, has improved. The people have strict 
notions of etiquette and gradations of rank. In disposition 
they are amiable and courteous, but arrogant, b'vely, inquisitive 
and inclined to steal — their attacks in earlier days on Europeans, 
when not caused by misunderstandings, being due probably 
to their coveting property which to them was of immense value. 
They are brave and not unenergetic, though the soft climate 
and the abundance of food discourage industry. They value 
children, and seldom practised infanticide, and cannibalism was 
rare. Their women are kindly treated, and only do the lighter 
work. Agriculture, which is well understood, is the chief 
industry! They are bold and skilful sailors and fishermen; 
other trades, as boat and house building, carving, cooking, net 
and mat making, are usually hereditary. Their houses are 
slightly built, but the surrounding ground and roads are laid 
out with great care and taste. 

There were formerly (till the early 18th century) two sovereigns; 
the higher of these, called Tui Tonga (chief of Tonga), was greatly 
reverenced but enjoyed little power. The real ruler and the chief 
officers of the state were members of the Tubou family, from which 
also the wife of the Tui Tonga was always chosen, whose descendants 
through the female line had special honours and privileges, under 
the title of tatnaha^ recalling the vasu of Fiji. The explanation 
of the dual kingship is probably this — the Tui Tonga were regarded 
as the direct descendants of the original head of the family from 
which the people sprang; regarded with reverence, and possessing 



unlimited power, they came to misuse this and discontent resulted, 
whereupon, to protect themselves, they # appointed an executive 
deputy. Below these came the Eiki or chiefs, and next to them the 
class called Matabule. These were the hereditary counsellors and 
companions of the chiefs, and conveyed to the people the decisions 
formed at their assemblies. They also directed the national cere- 
monies, and preserved the popular traditions. While, under the 
control of Europeans, the Tongans have shown some aptitude for 
administration, they fail when left to themselves. They pick up 
superficial acquijcements with astonishing ease, but seem to be 
incapable of mastering any subject. They write shorthand, but 
speak no English; they have a smattering^ of higher mathematics, 
yet are ignorant of book-keeping. Their government, effective 
enough when dealing with natives, breaks down in all departments 
concerned with Europeans, and becomes the_ prey of designing 
traders. Their ambition is to rank as a civilized state, and the 
flattery lavished on them by their teachers has spoiled them. 

There are some ancient stone remains in Tongatabu, burial places 
(feitoka) built with great blocks, and a remarkable monument 
consisting of two large upright blocks morticed to carry a transverse 
one, on which was formerly a circular basin of stone. 

Administration and Trade. — In May 1900 the group became a 
British protectorate under the native flag, the appointment of 
the consul and agent being transferred to the government of 
New Zealand. In 1904 the financial and legal administration 
was put into the hands of the British High Commissioner for 
the Western Pacific. The native king is assisted by a legislative 
assembly consisting, in equal numbers, of hereditary nobles and 
popular (elected) representatives. The wisdom of King George 
Tubou in refusing to alienate an acre of land, except upon lease, 
has resulted in Tonga having been the last native state in the 
Pacific to lose its independence. There is a revenue of about 
£21,000 annually derived chiefly from a poll-tax, leases and 
customs. The principal exports are copra, bananas, oranges and 
fungus, and the annual values of exports and imports are £80,000 
and £70,000 respectively on an average, though both fluctuate 
considerably. British coin is legal tender (since 1905). There 
are five churches in Tonga — the Free Wesleyans, embracing the 
great majority of the inhabitants, Wesleyans, Roman Catholics, 
and Seventh Day Adventists. These last are few; a still smaller 
number of natives are nominally Anglicans. 

History. — In 161 6 the vessels of Jacob Lemaire and Willem 
Cornells Schouten reached the island of Niuatobutabu, and had 
a hostile encounter with the natives. In 1643 Abel Tasman 
arrived at Tongatabu and was more fortunate. The next visit 
was that of Samuel Wallis in 1767, followed in 1773 by that of 
Captain Cook. In 1777 Cook returned, and stayed seven weeks 
among the islands. In 1799 a revolution, having its origin in 
jealousy between two natives of high rank, broke out. Civil 
war dragged on for many years— long after the deaths of the 
first leaders — but Taufaahau, who became king in 1845 under 
the name of George Tubou I., proved a strong ruler. In 1822 
a Methodist missionary had arrived in the island, and others 
followed. The attempt to introduce a new faith led to renewed 
strife, this time between converts and pagans, but King George 
(who fully appreciated the value of intercourse with foreigners) 
supported the missionaries, and by 1852 the rebels were subdued. 
The missionaries, finding their position secure, presently began 
to take action in political affairs, and persuaded the king to 
grant a constitution to the Tongans, who welcomed it with a 
kind of childish enthusiasm, but were far from fitted to receive 
it. A triennial parliament, a cabinet, a privy council, and an 
elaborate judicial system were estabh'shed, and the cumbrous 
machinery was placed in the hands of a " prime minister," a 
retired Wesleyan missionary, Mr Shirley Baker. Treaties of 
friendship were concluded with Germany, Great Britain, and 
the United States of America. Baker induced the king to break 
off his connexion with the Wesleyan body in Sydney, and to set 
up a state church. Persecution of members of the old church 
followed, and in 1890 the missionary-premier had to be removed 
from the group by the high commissioner. He afterwards 
returned to initiate a new sect called the " Free Church of 
England," which for a time created further divisions among the 
people. • 

King George Tubou died in 1893 at the age of ninety-six, and 
was succeeded by his great-grandson under the same title. 



TONGKING 



Mr Basil Thomson (who after Baker's deportation had carried 
out reforms which the natives, when left alone, were incapable 
of maintaining) was sent in 1900 to conclude the treaty by 
which the king placed his kingdom under British protection.

TONGKING, 1 a province of French Indo-China, and protec- 
torate of France, situated between 20 and 23^° N. and 102 and 
io8f° E., and bounded N. by the Chinese provinces of Kwang- 
Tung, Kwang-Si and Yun-nan, W. by Laos, S. by Annam, and 
E. by the Gulf of Tongking. Area, about 46,000 sq. m. The 
population is estimated at 6,000,000, including 33,000 Chinese 
and about 4000 Europeans. Geographically, Tongking com- 
prises three regions: (1) the delta of the Song-Koi (Red river), 
which, beginning at Son-Tay and coalescing with the delta of 
the Thai-Binh, widens out into the low-lying and fertile plain' 
within which are situated the principal cities. (2) Two moun- 
tainous tracts, to the north and west of the delta, running 
approximately from north-west to south-east, one separating 
the basins of the Song-Koi and the Canton river, the other those 
of the Song-Koi and the Mekong. (3) A region of plateaus 
and low hills forming a transition between the delta and the 
mountains. The main geographical feature in the country is 
the Song-Koi, which, taking its rise near Tali Fu, in Yun-nan, 
enters Tongking at Lao-Kay (the Lao boundary), and flows 
.thence in a south-easterly direction to the Gulf of Tongking. 
It was this river which mainly, in the first instance, attracted the 
French to Tongking, as it was believed by the explorers that, 
forming the shortest route by water to the rich province of 
Yun-nan, it would prove also to be the most convenient and 
expeditious means of transporting the tin, copper, silver and 
gold which are known to abound there. This belief, however, 
has proved fallacious. The upper course of the stream is 
constantly impeded by rapids, the lowest being about thirty 
miles above Hung-Hoa. Beyond Lao-Kay navigation is 
impracticable during the dry season, and at all other times of 
the year goods have to be there transferred into light junks. 
Below Lao-Kay larger junks, and in the summer months steam 
launches of shallow draught use the river. Within the limits 
of Yun-nan the navigation is still more difficult. Near Son-Tay 
the Song-Koi receives the waters of the Song-Bo (Black 
river) and the Song-Ka (Clear river), parallel affluents 
rising in Yun-nan, and from that point divides into a network of 
waterways which empty themselves by countless outlets into 
the sea. The Song-Cau rises in north-eastern Tongking and 
below the town of Sept Pagodes, where it is joined by the Song- 
Thuong to form the Thai-Binh, divides into numerous branches, 
communicating with the Sorig-Koi by the Canal des Rapides 
and the Canal des Bambous. 

The coast line of Tongking from Mon-Kay on the Chinese 
frontier to Thanh-Hoa, near that of* Annam, has a length of 
375 m. From Mon-Kay as far as the estuary of the Song-Koi it 
is broken, rugged and fringed with islands and rocky islets. The 
bay of Tien-Hien, to the south of which lies the island of Ke-Bao, 
and the picturesque bay of Along, are the chief indentations. 
Beyond the island of Cac-Ba, south of the Bay of Along, the coast 
is low, flat and marshy, and tends to advance as the alluvial 
deposits of the delta accumulate. 

The climate of Tongking is less trying to Europeans than that 
of the rest of French Indo-China. During June, July and August, 
the temperature ranges between 82 and ioo° F., but from October 
to May the weather is cool. The country is subject to typhoons in 
August and September. 

In the wooded regions of the mountains the tiger, elephant 
and panther are found, and wild buffalo, deer and monkeys are 
common.^ The delta is the home of ducks and many other varieties 
of aquatic birds. Tea, cardamom, and mulberry grow wild, and 
in general the flora approximate to that of southern China. 

The Annamese (see Annam), who form the bulk of the population 
of Tongking, are of a somewhat better physique than those of the 



1 See also Indo-China, French, and Annam. 



rest of Indo-China. Savage tribes inhabit the northern districts — 
the Muongs the mountains bordering the Black river, the Th6s the 
regions bordering the Clear river and the Thai-Binh. The Muongs 
are bigger and stronger than the Annamese. They have square 
foreheads, large faces and prominent cheek-bones, and their eyes are 
often almost straight. 

Rice, which in some places furnishes two crops annually, is incom- 
parably the most important product of the delta. Elsewhere there 
are plantations of coffee, tobacco, ramie, paper-tree (Daphne odora), 
cotton, jute, sugar-cane, pepper and mulberry. The cultivation 
of silkworms is of growing importance. 

Gold, copper, tin, lead and other metals are found in the higher 
regions of Tongking, but only gold and tin are exploited, and these 
only to a very limited extent. There is a large output of coal of 
inferior quality from Hon-Gay on the bay of Along and there are 
coal-workings on the island of Ke-Bao. 

Hanoi, Hai-phong and Nam-Dinh carry on cotton-spinning, and 
Hanoi and Nam-Dinh are well known for the manufacture of carved 
and inlaid furniture. The natives are skilful at enamelling and the 
chasing and ornamentation of gold and other metals. The manu- 
facture of paper from the fibrous bark* of the paper-tree is a wide- 
spread industry and there are numerous distilleries of rice-spirit. 

The imports of Tongking, which in 1905 reached a value of 
£3,501,422, comprise railway material, cereals, flour, liquors, woven 
goods, petroleum, glassware, paper, prepared skins, clocks and 
watches, arms and ammunition, &c.' Exports (valued at £1,393,674 
in 1905) comprise rice, rubber, manila hemp, ramie, lacquer and 
badian oils, raw skins, silk-waste, coal, Chinese drugs, rattan, mats, 
gamboge. 

The transit trade^ via Tongking between Hong-Kong and the 
province of Yun-nan in southern China is of considerable importance, 
reaching in 1905 a value of £1,146,000. This trade is entirely in 
the hands of Chinese houses, the tin of the Yun-nan mines and 
cotton yarns from Hong-Kong constituting its most important 
elements. Goods in transit enjoy a rebate of 80% of the customs 
duties. Goods are carried on the Song-Koi to Lao-Kay or Man-Hao, 
thence on mules. The waterways of the delta are lined with em- 
bankments, the causeways along which form the chief means of land 
communication of the region. (For railways, see Indo-China, 
French.) 

The protectorate of Tongking approaches nearer to direct admin- 
istration than that of Annam, where the conditions of the protector- 
ate are more closely observed. Till 1897 the emperor of Annam 
was represented in Tongking by a viceroy (kinh-luoc), but now the 
native officials are appointed by and are directly under the control 
of the resident-superior, who resides at Hanoi, presides over [the (pro- 
tectorate council, and is the chief territorialrepresentative of France. 
Tongking is divided into nineteen provinces, in each of which 
there is a resident or a vice-resident, and four military territories, 
the latter administered by commandants. In each province there 
is a council of native " notables," elected by natives and occupied 
with the discussion of the provincial budget and public works. 
There is also a deliberative council of natives (instituted 1907) for 
the whole of Tongking. The provincial administration, local 
government and educational system are analogous to those of Annam 
(£.t>.). Two chambers of the court of appeal of Indo-China and a 
criminal court sit at Hanoi; there are tribunals of first instance and 
tribunals of commerce at Hanoi and Hai-Phong. When both 
parties to a suit are Annamese, it comes within the jurisdiction of 
the An-Sat or native judge of the province.

The chief source of revenue is the direct taxes (including especially 
the poll-tax and land-tax), which amounted in 1904 to £^17,723, 
while the chief items of expenditure are the cost of the residencies 
and general staff, public works and the civil guard. 

For the early history of Tongking, see Annam and Indo-China, 
French. Tongking was loosely united to Annam until 1801, 
when Gia-long, king of Annam, brought it definitely under his 
sway. Having, by the treaty of 1862 and the annexation of 
Cochin China, firmly established themselves in Annamese 
territory, the French began to turn their attention to Tongking, 
attracted by the reported richness of its mineral wealth. They 
found a pretext for interfering in its affairs in the disturbances 
arising from the invasion of its northern provinces by the 
disbanded followers of the Taiping rebels. The Franco-German 
War of 1870-71 put an end to the project for a time, but the 
return of peace in Europe was the signal for the renewal of hos- 
tilities in the East. The appearance of Garnier's work on his 
expedition up the Mekong again aroused an interest in Tongking, 



TONGKING 



and the reported wealth of the country added the powerful 
motive of self-interest to the yearnings of patriotism. Already 
Jean Dupuis, a trader who in the pursuit of his calling had 
penetrated into Yun-nan, was attempting to negotiate for the 
passage up the Song-Koi of himself and a cargo of military stores 
for the Chinese authorities in Yun-nan. Meanwhile Captain 
Senez appeared from Saigon, having received instructions to 
open the route to French commerce. But to neither the trader 
nor the naval officer would the Tongkingese lend a favourable 
car, and in default of official permission Dupuis determined to 
force his way up the river. This he succeeded in doing, but 
arrived too late, for he found the Taiping rebellion crushed and 
the stores no longer wanted. 

On the return of Dupuis to Hanoi, the Tongkingese general 
at that place wrote to the king of Annam, begging him to induce 
the governor of Cochin-China to remove the intruder. An order 
was thereupon issued calling upon Dupuis to leave the country. 
This he declined to do, and, after some negotiations, Francis 
Gamier with a detachment was sent to Hanoi to do the best 
he could in the difficult circumstances. Gamier threw himself 
heart and soul into Dupuis's projects, and, when the Tongkingese 
authorities refused to treat with him except on the subject of 
Dupuis's expulsion, he attacked the citadel in November, 1873, 
and carried it by assault. Having thus secured his position, 
he sent to Saigon for reinforcements, and meanwhile sent small 
detachments against the five other important fortresses in the 
delta (Hung-yen, Phu-Ly, Hai-Duong, Ninh-Binh and Nam- 
Dinh), and captured them all. The Tongkingese now called in 
the help of Lu-Vinh-Phuoc, the leader of the " Black Flags," l 
who at once marched with a large force to the scene of action. 
Within a few days he recaptured several villages near Hanoi, 
and so threatening did his attitude appear that Gamier, who had 
hurried back after capturing Nam-Dinh, made a sortie from the 
citadel. The movement proved a disastrous one, and resulted 
in the death of Gamier and of his second in command, Balny 
d'Avri court. 

Meanwhile the news of Garnier's hostilities had alarmed the 
governor of Saigon, who, having no desire to be plunged into a 
war, sent Philastre, an inspector of native affairs., to offer 
apologies to the king of Annam. When, however, on arriving 
in Tongking Philastre heard of Garnier's death, he took command 
of the French forces, and at once ordered the evacuation of 
Nam-Dinh, Ninh-Binh and Hai-Duong — a measure which, 
however advantageous it may have been to the French at the 
moment, was most disastrous to the native Christian population, 
the withdrawal of the French being the signal for a general 
massacre of the converts. In pursuance of the same policy 
Philastre made a convention with the authorities (March, 1874) 
by which he bound his countrymen to withdraw from the occu- 
pation of the country, retaining only the right to trade on the 
Song-Koi and at Hanoi and Hai-Phong, and agreed to put an 
end to Dupuis's aggressive action. 

For a time affairs remained in statu quo, but in 1882 Le Myre 
deVillers, the governor of Cochin-China, sent Henri Riviere with 
a small force to open up the route to Yun-nan by the Song-Koi. 
With a curious similarity the events of Garnier's campaign were 
repeated. Finding the authorities intractable, Riviere stormed 
and carried the citadel of Hanoi, and then, with very slight loss, 
he captured Nam-Dinh, Hai-Duong, and other towns in the delta. 
And once again these victories brought the Black Flags into 
the neighbourhood of Hanoi. As Gamier had done, so Riviere 
hurried back from Nam-Dinh on news of the threatened danger. 
Like Gamier also he headed a sortie against his enemies, and like 
Gamier he fell a victim to nis own impetuosity (May, 1883). 

In the meantime the Annamese court had been seeking to 
enlist the help of the Chinese in their contest with the French. 
The tie which bound the tributary nation to the sovereign state 
had been for many generations slackened or drawn closer as 
circumstances determined, but it had never been entirely 
dissevered, and from the Annamese point of view this was one 

1 Bands of Chinese rebels who infested the mountainous region of 
Tongking. 



of the occasions when it was of paramount importance that it 
should be acknowledged and acted upon. With much more 
than usual regularity, therefore, the king despatched presents 
and letters to the court of Peking, and in 1880 he sent a special 
embassy, loaded with unusually costly offerings, and bearing a 
letter in which his position of a tributary was emphatically 
asserted. Far from ignoring the responsibility thrust upon him, 
the emperor of China ordered the publication of the letter in the 
Peking Gazette, 

The death of Riviere and the defeat of his troops had placed 
the French in a position of extreme difficulty. M. Jules Ferry, 
who had become premier of France in February 1883, determined 
on a vigorous forward policy. But for the moment the outlying 
garrisons, except those of Nam-Dinh and Hai-Phong, had to 
be withdrawn and Hanoi itself was besieged by the Black Flags. 
Reinforcements brought by Admiral Courbet and General Bouet 
were insufficient to do more than keep them at bay. So con- 
tinued was the pressure on the garrison that Bouet determined 
to make an advance upon Son-Tay to relieve the blockade. ,He 
attacked Vong, a fortified village, but he met with such resistance 
that, after suffering considerable loss, he was obliged to retreat 
to Hanoi. In the lower delta fortune sided with the French, 
and almost without a casualty Hai-Duong and Phu-Binh fell 
into their hands. Meanwhile, in order to put more effective 
pressure upon the court of Hue, Dr Harmand, commissary- 
general, supported by Courbet, proceeded with a naval force to 
the Hue river. They found that, though King Tu Due was dead, 
his policy of resistance was maintained, and therefore stormed 
the city. After a feeble defence it was taken, and Harmand 
concluded a treaty with the king (August 1883) in which the 
French protectorate was fully recognized, the king further 
binding himself to recall the Annamese troops serving in Tong- 
king, and to construct a road from Saigon to Hanoi. 

Though this treaty was exacted from Annam under pressure, 
the French lost no time in carrying out that part of it which 
gave them the authority to protect Tongking, and Bouet again 
advanced in the direction of Son-Tay. But again the resistance 
he met with compelled him to retreat, after capturing the fortified 
post of Palan. Meanwhile, on the determination to attack 
Son-Tay becoming known in Paris, the Chinese ambassador 
warned the ministry that, since Chinese troops formed part of 
the garrison, he should consider it as tantamount to a declaration 
of war. But his protest met with no consideration. On the 
arrival of reinforcements an advance was again made; and on the 
16th of December 1883, after some desperate fighting, Son-Tay 
fell. 

During 1884 the French made themselves masters of the lower 
delta. Throughout the campaign Chinese regulars fought 
against the French, who thus found themselves involved in war 
with China. While hostilities were in progress M. Fournier, the 
French consul at Tientsin, had been negotiating for peace, so 
far as China was concerned, with Li Hung-chang, and in May 
1884 had signed and sealed a memorandum by which the 
Chinese plenipotentiary agreed that the Chinese troops should 
evacuate the northern provinces of Tongking " immtdiatementP 
In the following month another treaty, signed at Hue, confirmed 
the French protectorate over Annam and Tongking. It was 
not, however, followed by a cessation of military operations. 
A misunderstanding arose between the French and the Chinese 
as to the exact date for the evacuation of their posts by the 
Chinese, and in June General Millot, then commander-in-chief of 
the French forces, dispatched Colonel Dugenne at the head of 
a strong force to occupy Lang-Son. The expedition was badly 
arranged; the baggage train was far too unwieldy; and the pace 
at which the men were made to march was too quick for that 
scorching time of the year. They advanced, however, to Bac-Le, 
within 25 m. of Lang-Son, when they suddenly came upon a 
Chinese camp. An irregular engagement began, and, in the 
pitched battle which ensued, the Chinese broke the French lines, 
and drove them away in headlong flight. This brought the 
military operations for the season to a close. 

During the rainy season fevers of all kinds became alarmingly 



TONGS— TONGUE 



prevalent, and the number of deaths and of men invalided 
was very large. In the meantime, however, an expedition, led 
by Colonel Donnier, against the Chinese garrison at Chu, about 
10 m. south-east from Lang-kep, was completely successful; 
and in a battle fought near Chu the Chinese were defeated, with 
a loss of 3000 killed, the French loss being only 20 killed and 90 
wounded. In the skirmishes which followed the French were 
generally victorious, but not to such a degree as to warrant any 
enlargement of the campaign. 

In January 1885 large reinforcements arrived and Briere 
de Tlsle, who had succeeded Millot as commander-in-chief, 
ordered an advance towards Lang-Son. The difficulties of 
transport greatly impeded his movements, still the expedition 
was successful. On the 6th of February three forts at Dong- 
Song, with large supplies of stores and ammunition, fell into the 
hands of the French. Three days' heavy righting made them 
masters of a defile on the road, and on the 13th Lang-Son was 
taken, the garrison having evacuated the town just before the 
entrance of the conquerors. With his usual energy General 
Negrier, who commanded a division under Briere de Tlsle, 
pressed on in pursuit to Ki-Hea, and even captured the frontier 
town of Cua-Ai. But Briere de ITsle had now to hurry back 
to the relief of Tuyen-Kwan, which was doggedly resisting the 
attacks of an overwhelming Chinese force, and Negrier was left 
in command at Lang-Son. The withdrawal of Briere de ITsle's 
division gave the Chinese greater confidence, and, though for a 
time Negrier was able to hold his own, on the 22nd and 23rd of 
March he sustained a severe check between Lang-Son and 
That-Ke, which was finally converted into a complete rout, 
his troops being obliged to retreat precipitately through Lang- 
Son to Than-Moi and Dong-Song. Briere de ITsle reached 
Tuyen-Kwan, the garrison of which was commanded by Colonel 
Domine, on the 3rd of March, and effected its relief. The 
disaster at Lang-Son caused the downfall of the Ferry ministry 
(March 30). Shortly afterwards Sir Robert Hart succeeded 
in negotiating peace with China. By the terms agreed on at 
Tientsin (June, 1885), it was stipulated that France was to take 
Tongking and Annam under its protection and to evacuate 
Formosa and the Pescadores. (For further history, see Indo- 
China.)

TONGS (O. Eng. lange, M. Eng. longe, cf. Du. lang, Ger. Zange, 
from base lang, to bite, cf. Gr. haxvtiv), a gripping and lifting 
instrument, of which there are many forms adapted to their 
specific use. Some are merely large pincers or nippers, but the 
greatest number fall into three classes: the first, as in the com- 
mon fire-tongs, used for picking up pieces of coal and placing 
them on a fire, which have long arms terminating in small flat 
circular grippers and are pivoted close to the handle; the second, 
as in the sugar-tongs, asparagus tongs, and the like, consisting 
of a single band of metal bent round or of two bands joined at 
the head by a spring, and third, such as the blacksmith's tongs 
or the crucible-tongs, in which the pivot or joint is placed close 
to the gripping ends. A special form of tongs is that known as 
the " lazy-tongs," consisting of a pair of grippers at the end of a 
series of levers pivoted together like scissors, the whole being 
closed or extended by the movement of the handles communi- 
cated to the first set of levers and thence to the grippers, the 
whole forming an extensible pair of tongs for gripping and lifting 
things at a distance. 

TONGUE (O. Eng. lunge), in anatomy, a movable organ 
situated in the floor of the mouth, and serving for the sensation 
of taste besides helping in the mastication of food, in articulate 
speech, and in feeling the exact position of any structure 
within the mouth. 

The tongue is divided into a main part or body, a base which 



looks backward toward the pharynx, a dorsum or upper surface, 
a root by which it is attached to the hyoid bone and floor of the 
mouth, a tip which is free and an inferior free surface in contact 
with the front part of the floor of the mouth and with the lower 
incisor teeth. Owing to the large amount of muscle in its com- 
position the shape of the tongue varies considerably from time 
to time. The dorsum of the tongue is covered by stratified 
squamous epithelium, and, when at rest, is convex both antero- 
posteriorly and transversely; it is thickly studded with papillae, 
of which four kinds are recognized. 

Filiform papillae are minute conical projections covering the 
whole of the dorsum, by which term the true upper surface is 
meant, as well as the tip and borders of the tongue. They are very 
numerous and contain a short core of subepithelial mucous mem- 
brane covered by a thick coating of epithelfal cells, which coating 
may divide at its tip into a number of thread-like processes. 

Fungiform papillae are less numerous than the last, and somewhat 
resemble " button mushrooms " ; they generally contain special 
taste buds. 

Circumvallate papillae are usually from seven to ten in number 
and are arranged in the form of a V, the apex of which points down 
the throat. They lie cjuite at the back of the upper surface of the 
tongue and each consists of a little flat central mound surrounded 
by a deep moat, the outer wall of which is slightly raised above the 
surface, and it is to this that the papillae owe their name. Both 
sides of the moat have taste buds embedded in them, while into the 
bottom small serous glands open. 

Foliate papillae are only vestigial in man and consist of a series 
of vertical ridges occupying a small oval area on each side of the 
tongue near its base and just in front of the attachment of the 
anterior pillars of the fauces. (See Pharynx.) 

The posterior surface or base of the tongue forms part of the anterior 
wall of the pharynx and has a quite different appearance to that of 
the dorsum. On it are found numerous circular or oval elevations 
of the mucous membrane caused by lymphoid tissue (lymphoid 
follicles), on the summit of the most of which is a mucous crypt 
or depression. The division between the superior or oral surface 
of the tongue and the posterior or pharyngeal is sharply marked by 
a V-shaped shallow groove called the sulcus terminahs which lies 
just behind and parallel to the V-shaped row of circumvallate 
papillae. At the apex of this V is a small blind pit, the foramen 
caecum. 

At the lower part of the pharyngeal surface three folds of mucous 
membrane, called glosso-epiglottic folds, run backward ; the middle 
one passes to the centre of the front of the epiglottis, while the two 
lateral ones, in modern anatomy often called pharyngo-epiglottic 
folds, pass backward and outward to the fossa of the tonsil. 

On the inferior free surface of the tongue, that is to say, the surface 
which is seen when the mouth is looked into and the tongue turned 
up, there is a median fold of mucous membrane called the fraenum 
linguae, which is attached below to the^ floor of the mouth. On each 
side of this the blue outlines of the ranine veins are seen, while close 
to these a little fold on each side, known as a plica fimbriata, is often 
found. It must not, however, be confused with the plica sublin- 
gualis described in the article Mouth and Salivary Glands. 

The substance of the tongue is composed almost entirely of striped 
muscle fibres which run in different directions. Some of these 
bundles, such as the superficial, deep, transverse and oblique linguales 
are confined to the tongue and are spoken of as intrinsic muscles. 
Other muscles, such as the hyo-glossus, stylo-glossus, &c. come 
from elsewhere and are extrinsic; these are noticed under the head 
of Muscular System. The arteries of the tongue are derived 
from the lingual, a branch of the external carotid (see Arteries), 
while the veins from the tongue return the blood, by one or more 
veins on each side, into the internal jugular vein (see Veins). 

The nerves to the tongue are the (1) lingual or gustatory, a branch 
of the fifth (see Nerves '.•Cranial) which supplies the anterior two- 
thirds with ordinary sensation and also, by means of the chorda 
tymphani which is bound up with it, with taste sensation; (2) 
the glossopharyngeal which supplies the circumvallate papillae 
and posterior third of the tongue with taste and ordinary sensation; 
(3) a few twigs of the superior laryngeal branch of the vagus to the 
pharyngeal surface of the tongue; and (4) the hypoglossal which is 
the motor nerve to the muscles. 

Embryology. 
The mucous membrane covering the second and third visceral 
arches fuses to form the furcula (see Respiratory System). Just 
in front of this a rounded eminence appears at an early date in 
the ventral wall of the pharynx to form the tuberculum impar 
which is separated from the furcula by the depression known as 
the sinus arcuatus. This tuberculum impar gradually grows to 
form the central part of the tongue in front of the foramen 
caecum, while the anterior part of the organ is derived from two 
lateral swellings which appear in the floor of the mouth and surround 
the tuberculum impar antero-laterally. The posterior third, or 
pharyngeal part, is developed from the anterior part of the furcula 



8 



TONGUE 



in the middle line, that is to say from the third visceral arch. The 
sinus arcuatus becomes gradually shallower as these two parts of 
the tongue grow together and eventually is indicated by the sulcus 
terminalis; in the mid line, however, the isthmus of the thyroid 
grows down from it, forming the thyro-glossal duct the remains of 
which are seen in the foramen caecum (see Ductless Glands). 
It will be seen that the tongue is developed in connexion with the 
first, second and third visceral arches, and it is therefore to be 
expected that the fifth, seventh and ninth nerves which supply 
those arches would help to supply it, but the vagus from the fourth 
arch reaches it in addition, while the fact that most of the muscular 
substance of the tongue is supplied by the hypoglossal nerve is 
explained on the theory that some of the cervical skeletal muscula- 
ture has grown cephalad into the tongue and has carried its nerve 
with it. 

Comparative Anatomy. 
The tongue is present in fishes but it is an immovable swelling in 
the floor of the mouth and is practically devoid of muscles. In the 
hag (Myxine) among the Cyclostomata, and pike (Esox) among the 



well developed the circumvallate papillae are few, often only one 
on each side. , 

In the lemurs an under tongue or sub lingua is found, which is 
probably represented by the plicae fimbriatae under the human 
tongue, and by some morphologists is regarded as the homologue 
of the whole tongue of the lower vertebrates, the greater part of 
the mammalian tongue being then looked upon as a new formation.

Surgery of the Tongue. 

During infancy it is sometimes noticed that the little band of 
membrane (fraenum) which binds the under part of the tongue 
to the middle line of the floor of the mouth is unusually short. The 
condition will probably , right itself as the front part of the tongue 



takes on its natural growth.

Horizontal Section through Mouth and Pharynx at the Level of the Tonsils, 

Teleostei, teeth are developed on the tongue. In the Amphibia 
the tailed forms (Urodela) usually have tongues like fishes, though in 
the genus Spelerpes the organ is very free and can be protruded for 
a great distance. In the majority of the Anura the tongue is usually 
attached close to the front of the floor of the mouth so that it can 
be flapped^ forward with great rapidity. There are, however, two 
closely allied families of frogs (Xenopodidae and Pipidae) which 
form the orderof Aglossa, because in them the tongue is suppressed. 

In the reptiles the tongue is generally very movable, though 
this is not the case in the Crocodilia and many of the Chelonia. The 
forked tongues of snakes and many lizards and the highly specialized 
telescopic tongue of the chameleon are familiar objects. 

In # birds the tongue is usually covered with horny epithelium 
and is poorly supplied with muscles. When it is very protrusible, 
as in the woodpecker, the movement Is due to the hyoid, with the 
base of the tongue^ attached, moving forward. 

In the Mammalia the tongue is always movable by means of well- 
developed extrinsic and intrinsic muscles, while papillae and glands 
are numerous. The filiform papillae reach their maximum in the 
feline family of the Carnivora where they convert the tongue into 
a rasp by which bones can be licked clean of all flesh attached to 
them. 

Foliate papillae are best seen in the rodents, and when they are 



In some children the tongue is so 
large that it hangs out of the mouth, 
scratching itself upon the teeth. This 
condition is likely to be associated 
with weak intellect. 

Acute inflammation of the tongue 
may be caused by the sting of a wasp 
or by the entrance of septic germs 
through a wound, and the trouble may 
end in an abscess. 

Chronic inflammation of the tongue 
may be caused by syphilis, by the 
irritation _ of decayed teeth or of a 
badly-fittingplate of artificial teeth, 
or by excessive smoking. The con- 
dition is one of danger in that it may 
lead eventually to the tongue becom- 
ing the seat of cancer. The treatment 
demands the removal of every source 
of irritation. The teeth must be made 
sound and smooth and must be kept 
so. Smoking must be absolutely and 
entirely given up, and salt, mustard, 
pickles, _ spirits, aerated waters, and 
everything else which is likely to be a 
cause of irritation must be avoided. 

Cancer of the tongue is the result of 
chronic irritation which produces an 
excessive growth of the scaly covering 
of the tongue and causes an invasion 
of the deeper parts of the tongue by 
the scales. It is moreoften found in 
men than women and is usually asso- 
ciated with a hard swelling at one side 
of the tongue — perhaps near a jagged 
tooth or at the spot where the end of 
the pipe-stem approaches the tongue. 
The nerves of the tongue being caught 
and compressed in the growth, pain 
is constant and severe, and the move- 
ments during mastication cause great 
distress.^ The swelling gradually in- 
creases in size and, spreading to the 
floor of the mouth, hinders the free 
movements of the tongue. In due 
course it breaks down in the middle 
and a hard- walled ulcer appears. All 
this time the small scales of the cancer 
are finding their way along the lymph-channels and causing a 
secondary enlargement in the glands just below the jaw and along 
the side of the neck. Enlargement of the cervical glands is a very 
serious complication of cancer of the tongue. 

The only treatment for cancer of the tongue which is at present 
known in surgery is the early removal^ by operation. It not seldom 
happens that because there is a certain amount of doubt as to the 
exact nature of the growth in the early weeks delay in operating 
is reasonably permitted, but during this time there is the risk of 
the cells of the disease finding their way to the lymphatic system. 
Still, inasmuch as there may be great difficulty in determining the 
diagnosis from tertiary syphilitic disease, a course of treatment by 
iodide of potassium may well be recommended. Syphilis is often 
the precursor of lingua^ cancer, and it is^ impossible to say exactly 
when the syphilitic lesion becomes malignant. In the ease of a 
cancerous tumour of the tongue being so deeply or so widely attached 
that its removal cannot be recommended, relief may be afforded by 
the extraction of most, or all of the teeth, by limiting the food to the 
most simple and unirritating kinds, and possibly by dividing the 
great sensory nerves of the tongue. 

Cancer of the tongue is now operated on in advanced cases such as in 
former years would not have been dealt with by a radical operation. 
An incision is made beneath the jaw and through the floor of the

mouth, by which the tongue is drawn out and rendered easily 
accessible, the arteries being leisurely secured as the tissues are cut 
across. The upper part of the gullet is plugged by a sponge so that 
no blood can enter the lungs, and unimpeded respiration is provided 
for by the preliminary introduction of a tube into the windpipe. 
Through the incision which is made below the jaw the infected 
lymphatic glands are removed. To Dr Kocher of Berne the profes- 
sion and the public are indebted for this important advance in the 
treatment of this disease. (£• O*.) 

TONGUES, GIFT OF, or Glossolalia frXaxrffa, tongue, 
XaAeu', speak), a faculty of abnormal and inarticulate vocal 
utterance, under stress of religious excitement, which was 
widely developed in the early Christian circles, and has its 
parallels in other religions. In the New Testament such 
experiences are recorded in Caesarea (Acts x. 46), at Corinth 
(Acts xix. 6; 1 Cor. xii., xiv.), Thessalonica (1 Thess. v. 19), 
Ephesus (Eph. v. 18), and universally (Mark xvi. 17). From 
the epistles of Paul, who thanked God that he spake with tongues 
more than all or any of his Corinthian converts, we can gather a 
just idea of how he regarded this gift and of what it really was. 

Firstly, then, it was a grace {charisma) of the spirit, yet not 
of the holy or pure spirit only, but of evil spirits also who on 
occasions had been known to take possession of the larynx of a 
saint and exclaim, " Jesus is Anathema." As no one could 
curse Jesus except under the influence of a devilish afflatus, so 
none could say " Jesus is Lord " except he was inspired by the 
Holy Spirit. But, secondly, the pneumatic utterances techni- 
cally known as speaking with tongues failed to reach this level 
of intelligibility; for Paul compares "a tongue" to a material 
object which should merely make a noise, to a pipe or harp 
twanged or blown at random without tune or time, to a trumpet 
blaring idly and not according to a code of signal notes. Unless, 
therefore, he that has the gift of tongues also possess the gift 
of interpreting his exclamations, or unless some one present can 
do so for him, he had not better exercise it in church. He is 
a barbarian to others and they to him, since they cannot under- 
stand what is spoken by him. Paul discriminates between the 
Spirit which during these paroxysms both talks and prays to God 
and the nous or understanding which informs a believer's psalm, 
teaching, revelation or prophesy, and renders them intelligible, 
edifying and profitable to the assembly. Accordingly Paul 
lays down rules which he regarded as embodying the Lord's 
commandment. A man " that speaketh in a tongue speaketh 
not unto men, but unto God; for no man understandeth;" and 
therefore it is expedient that he keep this gift for his private 
chamber and there pour out the mysteries. In church it is best 
that he should confine himself to prophesying, for that brings 
to others " edification and comfort and consolation." If, 
however, tongues must be heard in the public assembly, then let 
not more than three of the saints exhibit the gift, and they only 
in succession. Nor let them exhibit it at all, unless there is 
some one present who can interpret the tongues and tell the 
meeting what it all means. If the whole congregation be 
talking with tongues all at once, and an unbeliever or one with 
no experience of pneumatic gifts come in, what will he think, 
asks Paul. Surely that " you are mad." So at Pentecost on 
the occasion of the first outpouring of the Spirit the saints w r ere 
by the bystanders accused of being drunk (Acts ii. 15). In 
the church meeting, says Paul, " I had rather speak five words 
with my understanding, that I might instruct others also, than 
ten thousand words in a tongue." 

The writer of Acts ii., anxious to prove that Providence 
from the first included the Gentiles in the Messianic Kingdom, 
assumes that the gift of tongues was a miraculous faculty of 
talking strange languages without having previously learned 
them. Augustine accordingly held that each of the disciples 
talked all languages miraculously; Chrysostom that each talked 
one other than his own. The Pentecostal inspiration has been 
construed as a providential antithesis to the confusion of tongues 
— an idea which Grotius expressed in the words: " Poena 
linguarum dispersit homines; donum linguarum dispersos in 
unum populum collegit." Competent critics to-day recognize 
that such a view is impossible; and it has been suggested with 



much probability that in the second chapter of Acts the words 
in v. 5: " Now there were dwelling . . . under heaven " as well as 
vv. 6-1 1 : " because that every man . . . mighty works of God " 
were interpolated by Luke in the document he transcribed. 1 
The faithful talking with tongues were taken by bystanders 
for drunken men, but intoxicated men do not talk in languages 
of which they are normally ignorant. 2 

Paul on the whole discouraged glossolaly. " Desire earnestly 
the greater gifts," he wrote to the Corinthians. The gift of 
tongues was suitable rather to children in the faith than to the 
mature. Tongues were, he felt, to cease whenever the perfect 
should come; and the believer who spoke with the tongues of 
men and of angels, if he had not love, was no better than the 
sounding brass and clanging cymbal of the noisy heathen 
mysteries. It was clearly a gift productive of much disturbance 
in the Church (1 Cor. xiv. 23). He would not, however, entirely 
forbid and quench it (1 Thess. v. 19), so long as decency and order 
were preserved. 

It is not then surprising that we hear little of it after the 
apostolic age. It faded away in the great Church, and probably 
Celsus was describing Montanist circles (though Origen assumed 
that they were ordinary believers) when he wrote 3 of the many 
Christians of no repute who at the least provocation, whether 
within or without their temples, threw themselves about like 
inspired persons; while others did the same in cities or among 
armies in order to collect alms, roaming about cities or camps. 
They were wont to cry out, each of himself, " I am God; I am 
the Son of God; or I am the divine Spirit." They would indulge 
in prophecies of the last judgment, and back their threats with 
a string of strange, half-frantic and utterly unmeaning sounds, 
the sense of which no one with any intelligence could discover; 
for they were obscure gibberish, and merely furnished any fool 
or impostor with an occasion to twist the utterances as he chose 
to his own purposes. 

In the above we get a glimpse both of the glossalist and of his 
interpreter as they appeared to the outside world; and the 
impression made on them is not unlike that which Paul appre- 
hended would be left on outsiders by an indiscriminate use of 
the gift. Tertullian early in the 3rd century testifies that 
glossolaly still went on in the Montanist Church which he had 
joined; for we must so interpret the following passage in his 
De anima, cap. ix.: " There is among us at the present time a 
sister who is endowed with the charismatic gift of revelations, 
which she suffers through ecstasy in the spirit during the Sunday 
service in church. She converses with angels, sometimes even 
with the Lord, and both hears and see mysteries." The magical 
papyri teem with strings of senseless and barbaric words which 
probably answer to what certain of the Fathers called the 
language of demons. It has been suggested that we here have 
recorded the utterances of glossolalists. 

The attitude of Paul toward glossolaly among his converts 
strikingly resembles Plato's opinion as expressed in the Tintaeus, 
p. 72, of the enthusiastic ecstasies of the ancient 'iihvris (sooth- 
sayer). " God," he writes, " has given the art of divination not to 
the wisdom, but to the foolishness of man; for no man, when in 
his wits, attains prophetic truth and inspiration; but when he 
receives the inspired word either his intelligence is enthralled 
by sleep, or he is demented by some distemper or possession. 
And he who would understand what he remembers to have been 
said, whether in a dream or when he was awake, by the prophetic 
and enthusiastic nature, or what he has seen, must first recover 
his wits; and then he will be able to explain rationally what all 

1 This misunderstanding of Acts ii. has influenced the official 
Roman doctrine of demoniacal possession. The Sacerdotale indi- 
cates as one of the symptoms of possession the ability of the possessed • 
to talk other tongues than his own. Cf. the^ Fustis dae?nonum t 
cap. xi. Venetus (1606): " Aliqui sermonem alienum a patria sua 
loquuntur etsi nunquam e laribus paternis recesserint." 

2 It is noteworthy that in Eph. v. 18 Paul contrasts the being filled 
with the Spirit with the foolishness of intoxication with wine, and 
remarks that those filled with the Spirit speak to themselves in 
psalms and hymns and spiritual songs and give thanks always for 
all things.

such words and apparitions mean, and what indications they 
afford to this man or that, of past, present or future good and 
evil. But, while he continues demented, he cannot judge of 
the visions which he sees or the words which he utters. . . . And 
for this reason it is customary to appoint diviners or interpreters 
to be judges of the true inspiration." 1 From such passages 
as the above we infer that the gift of tongues and of their inter- 
pretation was not peculiar to the Christian Church, but was a 
repetition in it of a phase common in ancient religions. The 
very phrase y\oxraai$ \a\elv, " to speak with tongues," was 
not invented by the New Testament writers, but borrowed from 
ordinary speech. 

Virgil (Aen. vi. 46, 98) draws a life-like picture of the ancient 
prophetess " speaking with tongues." He depicts her quick 
changes of colour, her dishevelled hair, her panting breast, her 
apparent increase of stature as the god draws nigh and fills her 
with his divine afflatus. Then her voice loses its mortars ring: 
" nee mortale sonans." The same morbid and abnormal trance 
utterances recur in Christian revivals in every age, e.g. among 
the mendicant friars of the 13th century, among the Jansenists, 
the early Quakers, the converts of Wesley and Whitefield, the 
persecuted protestants of the Cevennes, the Irvingites. 

Oracular possession of the kind above described is also common 
among savages and people of lower culture; and Dr Tylor, in 
his Primitive Culture, ii. 14, gives examples of ecstatic utterance 
interpreted by the sane. Thus in the Sandwich Islands the 
god Oro gave his oracles through a priest who " ceased to act 
or speak as a voluntary agent, but with his limbs convulsed, 
his features distorted and terrific, his eyes wild and strained, 
he would roll on the ground foaming at the mouth, and reveal 
the will of the god in shrill cries and sounds violent and indis- 
tinct, which the attending priests duly interpreted to the 
people."

TONK, a native state of India, in the Rajputana agency. It 
consists of six isolated tracts, some of which are under the Central 
India agency. Total area, 2553 sq. m.; total population (1901), 
273,201; estimated revenue £77,000. No tribute is payable. 
The chief, whose title is nawab, is a Mahommedan of Afghan 
descent. The founder of the family was Amir Khan, the noto- 
rious Pindari leader at the beginning of the 19th century, who 
received the present territory on submitting to the British in 
1817. The nawab Mahommed Ibrahim Ali Khan, G.C.I.E., 
succeeded in 1867, and was one of the few chiefs who attended 
both Lord Lytton's Durbar in 1877 and the Delhi Durbar of 1903 
as rulers of their states. The late minister, Sir Sahibzada 
Obeidullah Khan, was deputed on political duty to Peshawar 
during the Tirah campaign of 1897. Grain, cotton, opium and 
hides are the chief exports. Two of the outlying tracts of the 
state are served by two railways. Distress was caused by 
drought in 1890-1900. The town of Tonk is situated 1462 ft. 
above sea-level, 60 m. by road south from Jaipur, near the right 
bank of the river Banas. Pop. (1901), 38,759. It is surrounded 
by a wall, with a mud fort. It has a high school, the Walter 
female hospital under a lady superintendent, and a hospital for 
males. 

There is another town in India called Tonk, or Tank, in Dera 
Ismail Khan district, North-West Frontier Province; pop. (1901), 
4402. It is the residence of a nawab, who formerly exercised 
semi-independent powers. Here Sir Henry Durand, lieutenant- 
governor of the Punjab, was killed in 1870 when passing on an 
elephant under a gateway. 

TONNAGE. The mode of ascertaining the tonnage of mer- 
chant ships is settled by the Merchant Shipping Acts. But 
before explaining the method by which this is computed, it is 
well to remark that* there are several tonnages employed in 
different connexions. Displacement tonnage is that which is 
invariably used in respect of warships, and is the actual weight 
of water displaced by the vessel whose tonnage is being dealt 
1 Jowett's translation. 



with. Men-of-War are designed to carry all their weights, 
including coal, guns, ammunition, stores and water in tanks and 
in boilers, at a certain draught, and the tonnage attributed to 
them is the weight of water which at that designed draught 
they actually displace. This displacement tonnage is therefore 
a total made up of the actual weight of the ship's fabric and 
that of everything that is on board of her. It can be found by 
ascertaining the exact cubic space occupied by the part of her 
body which is immersed (including her rudder, propellers and 
external shafting) at the draught under consideration in cubic 
feet, and dividing this by 35, since 35 cubic feet of sea-water 
weigh one ton. Of course there is nothing to prevent displace- 
ment tonnage from being used in describing the size of merchant 
ships, and indeed in regard to the performances of fast steam- 
ships on trial it is usual to give their draught on the occasion 
when they are tested, and to state what was their actual displace- 
ment under these trial conditions. But it is obvious, from what 
has been said as to the components which go to make up the 
displacement at load draught, that this tonnage must, in respect 
of any individual ship, be the greatest figure which can be quoted 
in regard to her size. It is usual for dues to be assessed against 
merchant vessels in respect of their registered tonnage. This must 
therefore be fixed by authority, and at present vessels are 
measured by the officer of customs according to the rules laid 
down in the second schedule to the Merchant Shipping Act 
1894. As will be seen from the explanation of the method 
adopted, this is a somewhat arbitrary process, and even the 
gross registered tonnage affords little indication of the actual 
size of the ship, whilst the under-deck and net tonnages are 
still less in accord with the extreme dimensions. 

As to length for tonnage, the measurements start with the 
tonnage deck, which in vessels with less than three decks is the 
upper, and in vessels of three or more decks is the second from 
below. The length for tonnage is measured in a straight line 
along this deck from the inside of the inner plank at the bow 
to the inside of the inner plank at the stern, making allowance 
for the rake, if any, which the midship bow and stern timbers 
may have in the actual deck. When this is measured it is 
apparent into which of five classes the ship's tonnage-length 
places her. If she be under 50 ft. in length she falls into the 
first class, while if she be over 225 ft. in length she falls into the 
fifth class, the remaining three classes being intermediate to 
these. Vessels of the first class are measured as in four equal 
sections, and vessels of the larger class as in twelve equal sections, 
according to their length. Then at each of the points of division 
so marked off transverse areas are taken. This is done by 
measuring the depth in feet from a point at a distance of one- 
third of the round of the beam below the tonnage deck to the 
upper side of the floor timbers. Where the vessel has a ceiling 
and no water-ballast tanks at the point of measurement, 2\ in. 
is allowed for ceiling. But where there are such tanks the 
measurement is taken from the top of the tank and no allowance 
is made for ceiling, whether there in fact be any or not. If the 
midship depth so found exceeds 16 ft., each depth is divided into 
six equal parts, and the horizontal breadths are measured at 
each point of division and also at the upper and lower points of 
the depth, extending each measurement to the average thickness 
of that part of the ceiling which is between the points of measure- 
ment. They are then numbered from above, and the second, 
fourth and sixth multiplied by four, whilst the third and fifth 
are multiplied by two. The products are then added together. 
To the sum are added the first and the seventh breadths. This 
total having been multiplied by one-third the common interval 
between the breadths, the resultant is the transverse area. The 
transverse areas so obtained at each point of the vessel's length 
are numbered from the bow aft. Omitting the first and last, the 
second and every even area so obtained are multiplied by four, 
whilst the third and every odd area are multiplied by two. 
These products are added together, as are also those of the first 
and last areas if they yield anything, and the figure thus reached 
is multiplied by one-third of the common interval between the 
areas. This product is reckoned as the cubical capacity of the

ship in feet. When divided by 100 the result is the registered 
under-deck tonnage of the ship — subject to the additions and 
deductions ordered by the act. Directions of a kind similar 
to those already set out are given whereby the tonnage in the 
space enclosed between the tonnage and upper decks may be 
ascertained, and also for the measuring of any break, poop or 
other permanent closed-in space on the upper deck available 
for stores, and the sum of the capacity of these must be added 
to the under-deck tonnage to arrive at the gross registered tonnage. 
But an express proviso is enacted that no addition shall be made 
in respect of any building erected for the shelter of deck pas- 
sengers and approved by the board of trade. In the process of 
arriving at the net tonnage the main deduction allowed from the 
gross tonnage is that of machinery space in steamships. The 
method of measurement here is similar to that by which the 
under-deck tonnage is reached. Where the engines and boilers 
are fitted in separate compartments, each compartment is 
measured separately, as is the screw shaft tunnel in the case 
of steamships propelled by screws. The tonnage of these spaces 
is reckoned, not from the tonnage deck, but from the crown of 
the space; whilst, if it has previously been reckoned in the gross 
tonnage, there may be an allowance for the space above the 
crown, if enclosed for the machinery or for the admission of 
light and air. Allowances are only made in respect of any 
machinery space if it be devoted solely to machinery or to 
light and air. It must not be used for cargo purposes or 
for cabins. Further, by the act itself in the case of paddle 
steamships, where the machinery space is above 20% and 
under 30% of the gross tonnage, it is allowed to be reckoned 
as 37% of such gross tonnage; whilst similarly, in the case of 
screw steamships, where such machinery space is over T3 % 
and under 20 % of the gross tonnage, it is allowed to be reckoned 
as 32%. Further deductions are also made in respect of space 
used solely for the accommodation of the master and the crew, 
and for the chart-room and signal-room, as well as for the wheel- 
house and chain cable locker and for the donkey-engine and 
boiler, if connected with the main pumps of the ship, and in 
sailing vessels for the sail locker. The space in the double 
bottom and in the water-ballast tanks, if these be not available 
for the carriage of fuel stores or cargo, is also deducted if it has 
been reckoned in the gross tonnage in the first instance. 

From the rules above laid down it follows that it is possible 
for vessels, if built with a full midship section, to have a gross 
registered tonnage considerably below what the actual cubical 
capacity of the ship would give, whilst in the case of steam 
tugs of high power it is not unprecedented, owing to the large 
allowances for machinery and crew spaces, for a vessel to 
have a registered net tonnage of nil. 

Suez Canal dues being charged on what is practically the 
registered tonnage (though all deductions permitted by the 
British board of trade are not accepted), it is usual, at all events 
in the British navy, for warships to be measured for what would 
be their registered tonnage if they were merchant ships, so that 
in case they may wish to pass through the canal a scale of 
payment may be easily reached. But such tonnage is never 
spoken of in considering their size relative to other vessels. 

Two other tonnages are also made use of in connexion with 
merchant ships, especially when specifications for vessels are 
being made. The first of these is measurement capacity. This 
is found by measuring out the true cubic capacity of the holds, 
whereby it is found what amount of light measurement goods 
can be carried. The second is deadweight capacity. This is 
generally given as excluding what is carried in the coal bunkers, 
and it is therefore the amount of deadweight which can be carried 
in the holds at load draught when the vessel is fully charged 
with coals and stores. (B. W. G.) 

TONNAGE AND POUNDAGE, in England, customs duties 
anciently imposed upon exports and imports, the former being a 
duty upon all wines imported in addition to prisage and butlerage, 
the latter a duty imposed ad valorem at the rate of twelve- 
pence in the pound on all merchandise imported or exported. 
The duties were levied at first by agreement with merchants 



(poundage in 1302, tonnage in T347), then granted by parliament 
in 1373, at first for a limited period only. They were considered 
to be imposed for the defence of the realm. From the reign 
of Henry VI. until that of James I. they were usually granted 
for life. They were not granted to Charles I., and in 1628 that 
king took the unconstitutional course of levying them on his 
own authority, a course denounced a few years later by 
r6 Car. I. c. 18 (1640), when the Long Parliament granted them 
for two months. After the Restoration they were granted to 
Charles II. and his two successors for life. By acts of Anne and 
George I. the duties were made perpetual, and mortgaged for the 
public debt. In 1 787 they were finally abolished, and other modes 
of obtaining revenue substituted, by 27 Geo. III. c. r3 (1787). 

Poundage also signifies a fee paid to an officer of a court for his 
services, e.g. to a sheriff's officer, who is entitled by 29 EHz. c. 4 
(1586-1587; to a poundage of a shilling in the pound on an execution 
up to £100, and sixpence in the pound above that sum. 

TONNERRE, a town of north-central France, capital of an 
arrondissement in the department of Yonne, 52 m. S.E. of Sens 
on the Paris-Lyon railway. Pop. (1906), 3974. It is situated 
on a slope of the vineclad hills on the left bank of the Armangon. 
At the foot of the hill rises the spring of Fosse-Dionne, enclosed 
in a circular basin 49 ft. in diameter. The town has two interest- 
ing churches. That of St Pierre, which crowns the hill, possesses 
a fine lateral portal of the Renaissance period to which the church, 
with the exception of the choir (1351), belongs. The church of 
Notre-Dame is mainly Gothic, but the facade is a fine specimen 
of Renaissance architecture. The Salle des Malades, a large 
timber-roofed apartment in the hospital, dates from the end of 
the 13th century and is used as a chapel. It is 330 ft. long and 
contains the tombs of Margaret of Burgundy, wife of Charles 
of Anjou, king of Sicily, and foundress of the hospital, and of 
Francois-Michel Le Tellfer, marquis of Louvois, war minister 
of Louis XIV. The hospital itself was rebuilt in the 19th 
century. The Renaissance H6tel d'Uzes was built in the 16th 
century. Tonnerre is the seat of a sub-prefect and has a tribunal 
of first instance. The vineyards of the vicinity produce well- 
known wines. The trade of the town is chiefly in wine, in 
the good building-stone found in the neighbourhood and in 
Portland cement. Cooperage is carried on. 

Its ancient name of Tornodorttm points to a Gallic or Gallo- 
Roman origin for Tonnerre. In the 6th century it became the 
capital of the region of Tonnerrois and in the 10th century of a 
countship. After passing into the possession of several noble 
families, it was bought from a count of Clermont-Tonnerre by 
Louvois, by whose descendants it was held up to the time of 
the Revolution. 

TONQUA BEAN. The Tonqua, Tonka or Tonquin bean, 
also called the coumara nut, is the seed of Dipterix odorata, a 
leguminous tree growing to a height of 80 ft., native of tropical 
South America. The drupe-like pod contains a single seed 
possessed of a fine sweet " new-mown hay " odour, due to the 
presence of coumarin (q.v.). Tonqua beans are used principally 
for scenting snuff and as an ingredient in perfume sachets and 
in perfumers' " bouquets." 

TONSBERG, a fortified seaport of Norway, in Jarlsberg- 
Laurvik amt (county), situated on a bay on the south coast, 
near the entrance to Christiania Fjord, 72 m. S. by W. of Christi- 
ania on the Skien railway. Pop. (1900), 8620. It is one of 
the most ancient towns in Norway. It is the headquarters of a 
sealing and whaling fleet. The principal industries are refineries 
for preparing whale and seal oil and saw-mills. An interesting 
collection of antiquities and whaling implements is preserved in 
the Slotstaarn on Castle Hill. 

TONSILLITIS, acute inflammation of the tonsils, or quinsy, 
due to the invasion of the tonsil, or tonsils, by septic micro- 
organisms which may have gained access through the mouth or 
by the blood-stream. Sometimes the attack comes on as the 
result of direct exposure to sewer gas, and it is not at all an 
uncommon affection of house surgeons, nurses and others 
who have to spend most of their time in a hospital. The 
association of quinsy with rheumatism may be the result of the 



12 



TONSON— TONTINE 



infection of the tonsils by the micro-organisms or the toxins 
of that disease. Acute tonsillitis is very apt to run on to the 
formation of abscess. Quinsy may begin with a feeling of 
chilliness or with an attack of shivering. Then comes on a 
swelling in the throat with pain, tenderness and difficulty in 
swallowing. Indeed, if both tonsils are acutely inflamed it 
may be impossible to swallow even fluid and the breathing 
may be seriously embarrassed. The temperature may be raised 
several degrees. There is pain about the ear and about the 
jaw, and there is a swelling of the glands in the neck. The 
breath is offensive and the tongue is thickly coated. There 
may be some yellowish markings on the surface of the tonsil, 
but these differ from the patches of " false membrane " of 
diphtheria in that they can be easily brushed off by a swab, but 
often a true diagnosis can only be made by bacteriological 
examination. The treatment consists in giving a purgative, 
and in encouraging the patient to use an inhaler containing hot 
carbolized water. Hot compresses also may be applied to the 
neck. As regards medicines, the most trustworthy are salicylic 
acid, iron and quinine. As soon as abscess threatens, a 
slender-bladed knife should be thrust from before backward 
deeply into the swollen mass. And if, as most likely happens, 
matter then escapes, the patient's distress speedily ends. Con- 
valescence having set in, a change of air and course of tonic 
treatment will be advisable. 

Chronic tonsillitis is often associated with adenoid vegetations 
at the back of the throat of tuberculous or delicate children, such 
children being spoken of as being " liable to sore throat." Chronic 
enlargement of the tonsils may seriously interfere with a child's 
general health and vigour and, should the condition not subside 
under general measures such as a stay at a bracing seaside place 
and the taking of cod-liver oil and iron, it will be well to treat the 
tonsils by operation. (E. O.*) 

TONSON, the name of a family of London booksellers and 
publishers. Richard and Jacob Tonson (c. 1656-1736), sons 
of a London barber-surgeon, started in 1676 and 1677 indepen- 
dently as booksellers and publishers in London. In 1679 Jacob, 
the better known of the two, bought and published Dryden's 
Troilus and Cressida, and from that time was closely associated' 
with Dryden, and published most of his works. He published 
the Miscellany Poems (1 684-1 708) under Dryden's editorship, 
the collection being known indifferently as Dryden 's or Tonson's 
Miscellany, and also Dryden's translation of Virgil (1697). 
Serious disagreements over the price paid, however, arose 
between poet and publisher, and in his Faction Displayed 
(1705) Dryden described Tonson as having " two left legs, and 
Judas-coloured hair." Subsequently the relations between the 
two men improved. The brothers jointly published Dryden's 
Spanish Friar (1683). Jacob Tonson also published Congreve's 
Double Dealer, Sir John Vanbrugh's The Faithful Friend and 
The Confederacy, and the pastorals of Pope, thus justifying 
Wycherly's description of him as "gentleman usher to the 
Muses." He bought also the valuable rights of Paradise Lost, 
half in 1683 and half in 1690. This was his first profitable 
venture in poetry. In 1712 he became joint publisher with 
Samuel Buckley of the Spectator, and in the following year 
published Addison's Cato. He was the original secretary and 
a prominent member of the Kit-Cat Club. About 1720 he gave 
up business and retired to Herefordshire, where he died on the 
2nd of April 1736. His business was carried on by his 
nephew, Jacob Tonson, jun. (d. 1735), and subsequently by 
his grand-nephew, also Jacob (d. 1767). 

TONSURE (Lat. tonsura, from tondere, to shave), a religious 
observance in the Roman Catholic and Orthodox Eastern 
Churches, consisting of the shaving or cutting part of the hair 
of the^ head as a sign of dedication to special service. The 
reception of the tonsure in these churches is the initial ceremony 
which marks admission to orders and to the rights and privileges 
of clerical standing. It is administered by the bishop with an 
appropriate ritual. Candidates for the rite must have been 
confirmed, be adequately instructed in the elements of the 
Christian faith, and be able to read and write. Those who have 
received it are bound (unless in exceptional circumstances) 
to renew the mark, consisting of a bare circle on the crown of 



the head, at least once a month, otherwise they forfeit the 
privileges it carries. The practice is not a primitive one; Ter- 
tullian simply advises Christians to avoid vanity in dressing 
their hair, and Jerome deprecates both long and closely cropped 
hair. According to Prudentius (Ilepur. xiii. 30) it' was customary 
for the hair to be cut short at ordination. Paulinus of Nola 
(c. 490) alludes to the tonsure as in use among the (Western) 
monks; from them the practice quickly spread to the clergy. 
For Gaul about the year 500 we have the testimony of Sidonius 
Apollinaris (iv. 13), who says that Germanicus the bishop had 
his hair cut " in rotae speciem." 

The earliest instance of an ecclesiastical precept on the subject 
occurs in can. 41 of the Council of Toledo (a.d. 633) :_ " omnes clerici, 
detonso superius capite toto, inferius solam circuH coronam relin- 
quant." Can. 33 of the Quinisext council (692) requires even singers 
and readers to be tonsured. Since the 8th century three tonsures 
have been more or less in use, known respectively as the Roman, 
the Greek and the Celtic. The first two are sometimes distinguished 
as the tonsure of Peter and the tonsure of Paul. The Roman or 
St Peter's tonsure prevailed in France, Spain and Italy. It consisted 
in shaving the whole head, leaving only a fringe of hair supposed to 
symbolize the crown of thorns- Late in the middle ages this 
tonsure was lessened for the clergy, but retained for monks and 
friars. In the Eastern or St Paul's tonsure the whole head was 
shaven, but when now practised in the Eastern Church this tonsure 
is held to be adequately shown when the hair is shorn close. In 
the Celtic tonsure (tonsure of St John, or, in contempt, tonsure of 
Simon Magus) all the hair in front of a line drawn over the top of 
the head from ear to ear was shaven (a fashion common among the 
Hindus). The question of the Roman or Celtic tonsure was one of 
the points in dispute in the early British Church, settled in favour 
of the Roman fashion at the Council of Whitby (664). The tonsure 
at first was never given separately, and even children when so 
dedicated were appointed readers, as no one could belong to the 
clerical state without at least a minor order. From the 7th century, 
however, children were tonsured without ordination, and later on 
adults anxious to escape secular jurisdiction were often tonsured 
without ordination. Till the 10th century the tonsure could be 
given by priests or even by laymen, but its bestowal was gradually 
restricted to bishops and abbots. 

TONTINE, a system of life insurance owing its name to 
Lorenzo Tonti, an Italian banker, born at Naples early in the 1 7th 
century, who settled in France about 1650. In 1653 he proposed 
to Cardinal Mazarin a new scheme for promoting a public loan. 
A total of 1,025,000 liyres was to be subscribed in ten portions 
of 102,500 livres each by ten classes of subscribers, the first class 
consisting of persons under 7, the second of persons above 7 and 
under 14, and so on to the tenth, which consisted of persons 
between 63 and 70. The annual fund of each class was to be 
divided among the survivors of that class, and on the death of the 
last individual the capital was to fall to the state. This plan of 
operations was authorized under the name of "tontine royale" 
by a royal edict, but this the parlement refused to register, and the 
idea remained in abeyance till 1689, when it was revived hy 
Louis XIV., who established a tontine of 1,400,000 tivres divided 
into fourteen classes of 100,000 each, the subscription being 300 
livres. This tontine was carried on till 1 7 26, when the last bene- 
ficiary died — a widow who at the time of her decease was drawing 
an annual income of 73,500 b'vres. Several other government 
tontines were afterwards set on foot; but in 1763 restrictions 
were introduced, and in 1770 all tontines at the time in existence 
were wound up. Private tontines continued to flourish in 
France for some years, the " tontine Lefarge," the most cele- 
brated of the kind, being opened in 1791. and closed in 1889. 

The tontine principle has often been applied in Great Britain, 
at one time in connexion with government life annuities. Many 
such tontines were set on foot between the years 1773 and 1789, 
those of 1773, 1775 and 1777 being commonly called the Irish 
tontines, as the money was borrowed under acts of the Irish parlia- 
ment. The most important English tontine was that of 1789, which 
was created by 29 Geo. III. c. 41. Under this act over a million was 
raised in 10,000 shares of £100, 5s. It was also often applied to the 
purchase^ of estates or the erection of buildings. The investor 
staked his money on the chance of his own life or the life of his 
nominee enduring for a longer period than the other lives involved 
in the speculation, in which case he expected to win a large prize. It 
was occasionally introduced into life assurance, more particularly 
by American life offices, but newer and more ingenious forms of 
contract ftave now made the tontine principle practically a thing 
of the past. (See National Debt ; Insurance.) 



TOOKE, J. H. 



TOOKE, JOHN HORNE (1736-1812), English politician and 
philologist, third son of John Home, a poulterer in Newport 
Market, whose business the boy when at Eton happily veiled 
under the title of a " Turkey merchant," was horn in Newport 
Street, Long Acre, Westminster, on the 25th of June 1736. 
After passing some time at school in Soho Square, and at a 
Kentish village, he went from 1744 to 1746 to Westminster 
School and for the next five or six years was at Eton. On the 
12th of January 1754 he was admitted as sizar at St John's 
College, Cambridge, and took his degree of B.A. in 1758,' as last 
but one of the senior optimes, Richard Beadon, his lifelong friend, 
afterwards bishop of Bath and Wells, being a wrangler in the 
same year. Home had been admitted on the 9th of November 
1756, as student at the Inner Temple, making the friendship of 
John Dunning and Lloyd Kenyon, but his father wished him to 
take orders in the English Church, and he was ordained deacon 
on the 23rd of September 1759 and priest on the 23rd of 
November 1760. For a few months he was usher at a boarding 
school at Blackheath, but on the 26th of September 1760 he 
became perpetual curate of New Brentford, the incumbency of 
which his father had purchased for him, and he retained its 
scanty profits until 1773. During a part of this time (1763-1764) 
he was absent on a tour in France, acting as the bear-leader of a 
son of the miser Elwes. Under the excitement created by the 
actions of Wilkes, Home plunged into politics, and in 1765 
hrought out a scathing pamphlet on Lords Bute and Mansfield, 
entitled " The Petition of an Englishman." In the autumn of 
1765 he escorted to Italy the son of a Mr Taylor. In Paris he 
made the acquaintance of Wilkes, and from Montpellier, in 
January 1766, addressed a letter to him which sowed the seeds 
of their personal antipathy. In the summer of 1767 Home 
landed again on English soil, and in 1768 secured the return of 
Wilkes to parliament for Middlesex. With inexhaustible energy 
he promoted the legal proceedings over the riot in St George's 
Fields, when a youth named Allen was killed, and exposed the 
irregularity in the judge's order for the execution of two Spital- 
fields weavers. His dispute with George Onslow, member for 
Surrey, who at first supported and then threw over Wilkes for 
place, culminated in a civil action, ultimately decided, after the 
reversal of a verdict which had been obtained through the charge 
of Lord Mansfield, in Home's favour, and in the loss by his 
opponent of his seat in parliament. An influential association, 
called " The Society for Supporting the Bill of Rights," was 
founded, mainly through the exertions of Home, in 1769, but 
the members were soon divided into two opposite camps, and 
in 1771 Home and Wilkes, their respective leaders, broke out 
into open warfare, to the damage of their cause. On the 1st 
of July 1771 Home obtained at Cambridge, though not without 
some opposition from members of both the political parties, his 
degree of M.A. Earlier in that year he claimed for the public the 
right of printing an account of the debates in parliament, and 
after a protracted struggle between the ministerial majority and 
the civic authorities, the right was definitely established. The 
energies of the indefatigable parson knew no bounds. In the 
same year (1771) he crossed swords with Junius, and ended in 
disarming his masked antagonist. Up to this time Home's fixed 
income consisted of those scanty emoluments attached to a 
position which galled him daily. He resigned his benefice in 
1773 and betook himself to the study of the law and philology. 
An accidental circumstance, however, occurred at this moment 
which largely afrected his future. His friend Mr William Tooke 
had purchased a considerable estate, including Purley Lodge, 
south of the town of Croydon in Surjey. The possession of 
this property brought about frequent disputes with an ad- 
joining landowner, Thomas de Grey, and, after many actions 
in the courts, his friends endeavoured to obtain, by a bill 
forced through the houses of parliament, the privileges which 
the law had not assigned to him (February 1774). Home, 
thereupon, by a bold libel on the Speaker, drew public atten- 
tion to the case, and though he himself was placed for a 
time in the custody of the serjeant-at-arms, the clauses which 
were injurious to the interest of Mr Tooke were eliminated from 



13 

the bill. Mr Tooke declared his intention of making Home 
the heir of his fortune, and, if the design was never carried 
into effect, during his lifetime he bestowed upon him large 
gifts of money. No sooner had this matter been happily 
settled than Home found himself involved in serious 
trouble, For his conduct in signing the advertisement soliciting 
subscriptions for the relief of the relatives of the Americans 
" murdered by the king's troops at Lexington and Concord," 
he was tried at the Guildhall on the 4th of July 1777, before 
Lord Mansfield, found guilty, and committed to the King's Bench 
prison in St George's Fields, from which he only emerged after 
a year's durance, and after a loss in fines and costs amounting to 
£1200. Soon after his deliverance he applied to be called to the 
bar, but his application was negatived on the ground that his 
orders in the Church were indelible. Home thereupon tried his 
fortune, but without success, on farming some Jand in Hunting- 
donshire. Two tracts about this time exercised great influence 
in the country. One of them, Facts Addressed to Landholders, 
&c. (1780), written by Home in conjunction with others, 
criticizing the measures of Lord North's ministry, passed through 
numerous editions; the other, A Letter on Parliamentary Reform 
(1782), addressed by him to Dunning, set out a scheme 
of reform, which he afterwards withdrew in favour of that 
advocated by Pitt. On his return from Huntingdonshire he 
became once more a frequent guest at Mr Tooke's house at 
Purley, and in 1782 assumed the name of Home Tooke. In 
1786 Home Tooke conferred perpetual fame upon his bene- 
factor's country house by adopting, as a second title of his 
elaborate philological treatise of "E7rea 7rrcp6«'ra, the more 
popular though misleading title of The Diversions of Purley. 
The treatise at once attracted attention in England and the 
Continent. The first part was published in 1786, the second 
in 1805. The best edition is that which was published in 1829, 
under the editorship 6f Richard Taylor, with the additions 
written in the author's interleaved copy. . 

Between 1782 and 1790 Tooke gave his support to Pitt, and 
in the election for Westminster, in 1784, threw all his energies 
into opposition to Fox. With Fox he was never on terms of 
friendship, and Samuel Rogers, in his Table Talk, asserts that 
their antipathy was so pronounced that at a dinner party given 
by a prominent Whig not the slightest notice was taken by Fox 
of the presence of Home Tooke. It was after the election of 
Westminster in 1788 that Tooke depicted the rival statesmen 
(Lord Chatham and Lord Holland, William Pitt and C. J. Fox) 
in his celebrated pamphlet of Two Pair of Portraits. At the 
general election of 1790 he came forward as a candidate for that 
distinguished constituency, in opposition to Fox and Lord Hood, 
hut was defeated; and, at a second trial in 1796, he was again 
at the bottom of the poll. Meantime the excesses of the French 
republicans had provoked reaction in England, and the Tory 
ministry adopted a policy of repression. Home Tooke was 
arrested early on the morning of the 16th of May 1794, and 
conveyed to the Tower. His trial for high treason lasted for six 
days (17th to 22nd of November) and ended in his acquittal, 
the jury only taking eight minutes to settle their verdict. His 
public life after this event was only distinguished by one act of 
importance. Through the influence of the second Lord Camel- 
ford, the fighting peer, he was returned to parliament in 1801 
for the pocket borough of Old Sarum. Lord Temple endeavoured 
to secure his exclusion on the ground that he had taken orders 
in the Church, and one of Gilray's caricatures delineates the two 
politicians, Temple and Camelford, playing at battledore and 
shuttlecock, with Home Tooke as the shuttlecock. The ministry 
of Addington would not support this suggestion, but a bill 
was at once introduced by them and carried into law, which 
rendered all persons in holy orders ineligible to sit in the House 
of Commons, and Home Tooke sat for that parliament only. 

The last years of Tooke's life were spent in retirement in a 
house on the west side of Wimbledon Common. The traditions 
of his Sunday parties have lasted unimpaired to this day, 
and the most pleasant pages penned by his biographer describe 
the politicians and the men of letters who gathered round his 



14 

hospitable board. His conversational powers rivalled those of 
Dr Johnson; and, if more of his sayings have not been chronicled 
for the benefit of posterity, the defect is due to the absence of a 
Boswell. Through the liberality of his friends, his last days 
were freed from the pressure of poverty, and he was enabled 
to place his illegitimate son in a position which soon brought 
him wealth, and to leave a competency to his two illegitimate 
daughters. Illness seized him early in 1810, and for the next 
two years his sufferings were acute. He died in his house at 
Wimbledon on the 18th of March 181 2, and his body was buried 
with that of his mother at Ealing, the tomb which he had 
prepared in the garden attached to his house at Wimbledon 
being found unsuitable for the interment. An altar-tomb still 
stands to his memory in Ealing churchyard. A catalogue of 
his library was printed in 1 813. 

The Life of Horne Tooke, by Alexander Stephens, is written in an 
unattractive style and was the work of an admirer only^ admitted 
to his acquaintance at the close of his days. The notice in the 
Quarterly Review, June 1812, of W. Hamilton Reid's compilation, 
is by J. W. Ward, Lord Dudley. The main facts of his life are set 
out by Mr J. E. Thorold Rogers, in his Historical Gleanings, 2nd 
series. Many of Horne Tooke's wittiest sayings are preserved in the 
Table Talk of Samuel Rogers and S. T. Coleridge. (W. P. C.) 

TOOKE, THOMAS (1774-1858), English economist, wasborn 
at St Petersburg on the 29th of February 1774. Entering a 
large Russian house in London at an early age, he acquired 
sound practical experience of commercial matters and became 
a recognized authority on finance and banking. He was one of 
the earliest advocates of free trade and drew up the Merchants' 
Petition presented to the House of Commons by Alexander 
Baring, afterwards Lord Ashburton. He gave evidence before 
several parliamentary committees, notably the committee of 
1821, on foreign trade, and those of 1832, 1840 and 1848 on the 
Bank Acts. He was elected a fellow of the Royal Society in 
1821. He died in London on the 26th of February 1858. 

Tooke was the author of Thoughts and Details on the High and Low 
Prices of the last Thirty Years (1823), Considerations on the State of 
the Currency (1826), in both of which he showed his hostility to the 
policy afterwards carried out in the Bank Act of 1844, but he is 
best known for his History of Prices and of the State of the Circulation 
during the Years 1703-1850 (6 vols., 1 838-1 857). In the first four 
volumes he treats (a) of the prices of corn, and the circumstances 
affecting prices ; (&) the prices of produce other than corn ; and (c) 
the state of the circulation. The two final volumes, written in 
conjunction with W. Newmarch (q.v.), deal with railways, free trade, 
hanking in Europe and the effects of new discoveries of gold. 

TOOL (0. Eng. tdl 7 generally referred to a root seen in the 
Goth, taujan, to make, or in the English word " taw," to work or 
dress leather), an implement or appliance used by a worker 
in the treatment of the substances used in his handicraft, 
whether in the preliminary operations of setting out and 
measuring the materials, in reducing his work to the required 
form by cutting or otherwise, in gauging it and testing its 
accuracy, or in duly securing it while thus being treated. 

For the tools of prehistoric man see such articles as Archaeology ; 
Flint Implements; and Egypt, § Art and Archaeology. 

In beginning a survey of tools it is necessary to draw the 
distinction between hand and machine tools. The former class 
includes any tool which is held and operated by the unaided 
hands, as a chisel, plane or saw. Attach one of these to some 
piece of operating mechanism, and it, with the environment of 
which it is the central essential object, becomes a machine tool. 
A very simple example is the common power-driven hack saw 
for metal, or the small high-speed drill, or the wood-boring auger 
held in a frame and turned by a winch handle and bevel-gears. 
The difference between these and a big frame-saw cutting down a 
dozen boards simultaneously, or the immense machine boring the 
cylinders of an ocean liner, or the great gun lathe, or the hydraulic 
press, is so vast that the relationship is hardly apparent. Often 
the tool itself is absolutely dwarfed by the machine, of which 
nevertheless it is the central object and around which the machine 
is designed and built. A milling machine weighing several tons 
will often be seen rotating a tool of but two or three dozen 
pounds' weight. Yet the machine is fitted with elaborate slides 
and self-acting movements, and provision for taking up wear, 



TOOKE, T.— TOOL 



and is worth some hundreds of pounds sterling, while the tool 
may not be worth two pounds. Such apparent anomalies are 
in constant evidence. We propose, therefore, first to take a 
survey of the principles that underlie the forms of tools, and 
then pursue the subject of their embodiment in machine tools. 

Hand Tools 
The most casual observation reveals the fact that tools admit 
of certain broad classifications. It is apparent that by far the 
larger number owe their value to their capacity for cutting or 
removing portions of material by an incisive or wedge-like 
action, leaving a smooth surface behind. An analysis of the 
essential methods of operation gives a broad grouping as 
follows: — 
I. The chisel group . . Typified by the chisel of the woodworker. 
II. The shearing group . „ „ scissors. 

III. The scrapers ... „ „ cabinet-maker's scrape. 

IV. The percussive and > hammer and the punch. 

detrusive group . ) ^ 

V. The moulding group . „ „ trowel. 

The first three are generally all regarded as cutting tools, 
notwithstanding that those in II. and III. do not operate as 
wedges, and therefore are not true chisels. But many occupy 
a border-line where the results obtained are practically those 
due to cutting, as in some of the shears, saws, milling cutters, 
files and grinding wheels, where, if the action is not directly 
wedge-like, it is certainly more or less incisive in character. 

Cutting Tools. — The cutting edge of a tool is the practical outcome 
of several conditions. Keenness of edge, equivalent to a small 
degree of angle between the tool faces, would appear at first sight 
to be the prime element in cutting, as indeed it is in the case of a 
razor, or in that of a chisel for soft wood. But that is not the prime 
condition in a tool for cutting iron or steel. Strength is of far 
greater importance, and to it some keenness of edge must be sacri- 
ficed. All cutting tools are wedges; but a razor or a chisel edge, 
included between angles of 15 or 20 , would be turned over at once 
if presented to iron or steel, for which angles of from 6o° to 75 are 
required. Further, much greater rigidity in the latter, to resist 
spring and fracture, is necessary than in the former, because the 
resistance to cutting is much greater. A workman can operate a 
turning tool by hand, even on heavy pieces of metal-work. Formerly 
all turning, no matter how large, was done by hand-operated tools, 
and after great muscular exertion a few pounds of metal might be 
removed in an hour.^ But coerce a similarly formed tool in a rigid 
guide or rest, and drive it by the power of ten or twenty men, and 
it hecomes possible to remove say a hundredweight of chips in an 
hour. Or, increase the size of the tool and its capacity for endurance, 
and drive by the power of 40 or 60 horses, and half a ton of chips 
may be removed in an hour. 

All machine tools of which the chisel is the type operate by cutting; 
that is, they act on the same principle and by the same essential 
method as the knife, razor or chisel, and not by that of the grind- 
stone. A single tool, however, may act as a cutting instrument at 
one time and as a scrape at another. The butcher's knife will 
afford a familiar illustration. It is used as a cutting tool when sever- 
ing a steak, but it becomes a scrape when used to clean the block. 
The difference is not therefore due to the form of the knife, but to the 
method of its application, a distinction which holds good in reference 
to the tools used by engineers. There is a very old hand tool once 
much used in the engineer's turnery, termed a graver." This was 
employed for cutting and for scraping indiscriminately, simply by 
varying the angle of its presentation. At that time the question 
of the best cutting angles was seldom raised or discussed, because 
the manipulative instinct of the turner settled it as the work pro- 
ceeded, and as the material operated on varied in texture and degree 
of hardness. But since the use of the slide rest holding tools rigidly 
fixed has become general, the question of the most suitable tool 
formation has been the subjectof much experiment and discussion. 
The almost unconscious experimenting which goes on every day 
in every workshop in the world proves that there may be a difference 
of several degrees of angle in tools doing similar work, without 
having any appreciable^ effect upon results. So long as certain 
broad principles and reasonable limits are observed, that is sufficient 
for practical purposes. ' 

Clearly, in order that a tool shall cut, it must possess an incisive 
form. In fig. 1, A might be thrust over the surface of the plate of 
metal, but no cutting action could take place. It would simply 
grind and polish the surface. If it were formed like B, the grinding 
action would give place to scraping, by which some material would 
be removed. _ Many tools are formed thus, but there is still no 
incisive or knife-like action, and the tool is simply a scrape and not 
a cutting tool. But C is a cutting tool, possessing penetrative- 
capacity. If now B were tilted backwards as at D, it would at 



HAND TOOLS] 



TOOL 



15 



once become a cutting tool. But its bevelled face would rub and 
grind on the surface of the work, producing friction and heat, and 
interfering with the penetrative action of the cutting edge. On 
the other hand, if C were tilted forwardsas at E its action would 
approximate to that of a scrape for the time being. But the high 
angle of the hinder bevelled face would not afford adequate support 
to the cutting edge, and the latter would therefore become worn 
off almost instantly, precisely as that of a razor or wood-working 
chisel would crumble away if operated on hard metal. It is obvious

therefore that the correct forrri for a cutting tool must depend upon 
a due balance being maintained between the angle of the front 
and of the bottom faces — " front " or " top rake," and "bottom 
rake" or "clearance" — considered in regard to their method of 
presentation to the work. ^ Since, too, all tools used in machines are 
held rigidly in one .position, differing in this respect froin hand- 
operated tools, it follows that a constant angle should be given to 
instruments which are used for operating on a given kind of metal 
or alloy. It does not matter whether a tool is driven in a lathe, 
or a planing machine, or a sharper or a slotten whether it is cutting 
on external or internal surfaces, it is always maintained in a direction 
perpendicularly to the point of application as in fig. 1, F, G, H, 
planing, turning and boring respectively. It is consistent with 
reason and with fact that the softer and more fibrous the metal, 
the keener must be the formation of the tool, and that, conversely, 
the harder and more crystalline the metal the more obtuse must be 
the cutting angles, as in the extremes of the razor and the tools 
for cutting iron and steel already instanced. < The three figures 
J, K, L show tools suitably formed for wrought iron and mild steel, 
for cast iron and cast steel, and for brass respectively. Cast iron 
and cast steel could not be cut properly with the first, nor wrought 
iron and fibrous steel with the second, nor either with the third. 
The angles given are those which accord best with general practice, 
but they are not constant, being varied by conditions, especially 
by lubrication and rigidity of fastenings. The profilesof the first 
and second tools are given mainly with the view of having material 
for grinding away, without the need for frequent reforging. But 
there are many tools which are formed quite differently when used 
in tool-holders and in turrets, though the same essential principles 
of angle are observed. 

The angle of clearance, or relief, a, in fig. 1, is an important detail 
of a cutting tool. It is of greater importance than an exact angle 
of top rake. But, given some sufficient angle of clearance, its 
exact amount is not of much moment. Neither need it be uniform 
for a given cutting edge. It may vary from say3° to 10°, or even 
20 , and under good conditions little or no practical differences will 
result. Actually it need never vary much from 5 to 7°.^ The object 
in giving a clearance angle is simply to prevent friction between 
the non-cutting face immediately adjacent to the edge and the 
surfaceof the work. The limit to this clearance is that at which 
insufficient support is afforded to the cutting edge. These^ are the 
two facts, which if fulfilled permit of a considerable range in clear- 
ance angle. The softer the metal being cut the greater can be the 
clearance ; the harder the materia] the less clearance is permissible 
because the edge requires greater support. 

The frdnt, or top rake, b in fig. 1, is the angle or slope of the front, 
or top face, of the tool; it is varied mainly according as materials 
are crystalline or fibrous. In the turnings and cuttings taken off 
the more crystalline metals and alloys, the broken appearance of the 
chips is distinguished from the shavings removed from the fibrous 
materials. This is a feature which always distinguishes cast iron 
and unannealed cast steel from mild steel, high carbon steel from 



that low in carbon, and cast iron from wrought iron. It indicates 
too that extra work is put on the tool in breaking up the chips, 
following immediately on their severance, and when the comminu- 
tions are very small they indicate insufficient top rake. This 
is a^ result that turners try to avoid when possible, or at least to 
minimize. Now the greater the slope of thc^ top rake the more 
easily will the cuttings come away, with the minimum of break in the 
crystalline materials and absolutely unbroken over lengths of many 
feet in the fibrous ones. The breaking up, or the continuity 
of the cuttings, therefore affords an indication of the suitability of 
the amount of top rake to its work. But compromise often has 
to be made between the ideal and the actual. The amount of top 
rake has to be limited in the harder metals and alloys in order to 
secure a strong tool angle, without which tools would lack the endur- 
ance required to sustain them through several hours without 
regrinding. 

The tool angle, c, is the angle included between top and bottom 
faces, and its amount, or thickness expressed in degrees, is a measure 
of the strength and endurance of any tool. At extremes it varies 
from about 15 ° to 85 . It is traceable in all kinds of tools, having 
very diverse forms. It is difficult to place some groups in the 
cutting category; they are on the border-line between cutting and 
scraping instruments. 

Typical Tools. — A bare enumeration of the diverse forms in which 
tools of the chisel type occur is not even possible here. The grouped 
illustrations (figs. 2 to 6) show some of the types, but it will be 
understood that each is varied in dimensions, angles and outlines 
to suit all the varied kinds of metals and alloys and conditions of 
operation. For, as every tool has to be gripped in a holder of some 
kind, as a slide-rest, tool-box, turret, tool-holder, box, cross-slide, 
&c, this often determines the choice of some one form in preference 
to another. A broad division is that into roughing and finishing

traverse of the second. The following are some of the principal 
forms. The round-nosed roughing tool (fig. 2) B is of straight- 
forward type, used for turning, 
planing and shaping. As the 
correct tool angle can only occur 
on the middle plane of the tool, it 
is usual to employ cranked tools, 
C, D, E, right- and left-handed, 
for heavy and moderately heavy 
duty, the direction of the crank- 
ing corresponding with that in 
which the tool is required to 
traverse. Tools for boring are 
cranked and many for planing 
(fig- 3)- The slotting tools (fig. 4) 
embody the same principle, but 
their < shanks are in line with 
the direction of cutting. Many 
roughing and finishing tools are 
of knife type H. Finishing tools 
have broad edges, F f G, H. They 
occur in straightforward and 
right- and left-hand types. 
These as a rule remove less than

used less now than formerly, are only of value for imparting a smooth 
finish to a surface. They are finishing tools only. Some spring 
tools are^ formed with considerable top rake, but generally they act 
by scraping only. 

Solid Tools v. Tool-holders. — It will be observed that the fore- 
going are solid tools ; that is, the cutting portion is forged from a solid 



bar of steel. This is costly when the best tool steel is used, hence 
large numbers of tools comprise points only, which are gripped in 
permanent holders in which they interchange. # Tool steel usually 
ranges from about § in. to 4 in. square ; most engineers' work is done 
with bars of from § in. to i§ in. square. It is in the smaller and 
medium sizes of tools that holders prove of most value. Solid tools, 
varying from 2§ in. to 4 in. square, are used for the heaviest cutting 
done in the planing machine. Tool-holders are not employed for very 
heavy work, because the heat generated would not get away fast 
enough from small tool points. There are scores of holders; per- 
haps a dozen good approved types are in common use. They are 
divisible into three great groups: those in which the top rake of 
the tool point is embodied in the holder,and is constant; thosein 
•which the clearance is similarly embodied; and those in which 
neither is provided for, but in which the tool point is ground to any 
angle. Charles Babbage designed the first tool-holder, and the 
essential type survives in several modern forms. The best-known 
holders now are the Tangye, the Smith & Coventry, the Armstrong, 
some by Mr C. Taylor, and the Bent. The Smith & Coventry (fig. 5), 
used more perhaps than any other single design, includes two forms. 
In one E the tool is a bit of round steel set at an angle which gives 
front rake, and having the top end ground to an angle of top rake. 
In the other A the tool has the section of a truncated wedge, set 
for constant top rake, or cutting angle, and having bottom rake 
or clearance angle ground. The Smith & Coventry round tool is 
not applicable for all classes of work. It will turn plain work, and 
plane level faces, but will not turn or plane into corners or angles. 
Hence the invention of the tool of V-section, and the swivel tool- 
holder. The round tool-holders are made right- and left-handed, 
the swivel tool-holder has a universal movement. The amount of 
projection of the round tool points is very limited, which impairs 
their utility when some overhanging of the tool is necessary. The 
V-tooIs can be slid out in their holders to operate on faces and 
edges situated to some considerable distance inwards from the end 
of the tool-holder. 

Box Tools. — In one feature the box tools of the turret lathes 
resemble tool-holders. The small pieces of steel used for tool 
points are gripped in the boxes, as, in tool-holders, and all the 
advantages which are derived from this arrangement of separating 
the point from its holder are thus secured (fig. 7). But in all other

respects the two are dissimilar. Two or three tool-holders of different 
sizes take all the tool points used in a lathe, but a new box has to- 
be devised in the case of almost every new job, with the exception 
of those the principal formation of which is the turning down of 
plain bars. The explanation is that, instead of a single point, 
several are commonly carried in a box. As complexity increases 
with the number of tools, new designs and dimensions of boxes 
become necessary, even though there may be family resemblances 
in groups. A result is that there is not, nor can there be T anything 
like finality in these designs. Turret work has become one of the 
most highly specialized departments of machine-shop practice, and 
the design of these boxes is already the work of" specialists. More 
and more of the work of the common lathe is being constantly 
appropriated by the semi- and full-automatic machines, a result to 
which the magazine feeds for castings and^ forgings that cannot 
pass through a hollow spindle have contributed greatly. New 
work is constantly being attacked in the automatic machines that 
was deemed impracticable a short time before ; some of the commoner 
jobs are^ produced with greater economy, while heavier castings, 
and forgings", longer and larger bars, are tooled in the turret lathes. 
iA great deal of the efficiency of the box tools is due to the support 
which is afforded to the cutting edges in opposition to the stress. 
of cutting. V-blocks are introduced in most cases as in fig. 7, and 
these not only resist the stress of the cutting, but gauge the diameter 
exactly. 

Shearing Action. — In many tools a shearing operation takes place r 
by which the stress of cutting is lessened. Though not very 
apparent, itis present^ in the round-nosed roughing tools, in the 
knife tools, in most milling cutters, as well as in all the shearing 
tools proper — the scissors, shears, &c. 

Planes. — We pass by the familiar great chisel group, used by wood- 
workers, with a brief notice. Generally the tool angles of these lie 
between 15 and 25 . They include the chisels proper, and the 
gouges in numerous shapes and proportions, used by carpenters^

cabinet-makers, turners, stone-masons and allied tradesmen. These 
are mostly thrust by hand to their work, without any mechanical 
control. Other chisels are used percussively, as the stout mortise 
chisels, some of the gouges, the axes, adzes and stone-mason's tools. 
The large family of planes embody chisels coerced by the mechanical 
control of the wooden (fig. 8) or metal stock. These also differ

metal though in a less marked degree. 

Drilling and Boring Tools, — Metal and timber are bored with 
equal facility; the tools (figs. 9 and 10) embody similar differences 
to the cutting tools already instanced for wood and metal. All the 
wood-working bits are true cutting tools, and their angles, if analysed, 
will be found not to differ much from those of the razor and common 
chisel. The drills for metal furnish examples both of scrapers and 
cutting tools. The common drill is only a scraper, but all the twist 
drills cut with good incisive action. An advantage possessed by all 
drills is that the cutting forces are balanced on each side of the 
centre of rotation. The same action is embodied in the best wood- 
boring bits and augers, as the Jennings, the Gilpin and the Irwin — 
much improved forms of the old centre-bit. But the balance is 
impaired if the lips are not absolutely symmetrical about the centre. 
This explains the necessity for the substitution of machine grinding 
for hand grinding of the lips, and great developments of twist drill 
grinding machines. Allied to the drills are the D-bits, and the 
reamers (fig. 11). The first-named both initiate and finish a hole;

blades forced outward by the tapered plug. Two lock-nuts at the 
end fix the blades firmly after adjustment. 

the second are used only for smoothing and enlarging drilled holes, 
and for correcting holes which pass through adjacent castings or 
plates. The reamers remove only a mere film, and their action 
is that of scraping. The foregoing are examples of tools operated 
from one end and unsupported at the other, except in so far as they 
receive support within the work. One of the objectionable features 
of tools operated in this way is that they tend to " follow the hole, ,r 
and if this is cored, or rough-drilled out of truth, there is risk of 
the boring tools following it to some extent at least. With the one 
exception of the D-bit there is no tool which can be relied on to take 
out a long bore with more than an approximation to concentricity 
throughout. Boring tools (fig. 12) held in the slide-rest will spring 
and bend and chatter, and unless the lathe is true, or careful com- 
pensation is made for its want of truth, they will bore bigger at one 
end than the other. Boring tools thrust by the back centre are 
liable to wabble, and though they are variously coerced to prevent 
them from turning round, that does not check the to-and-fro wabbly

motion from following the core, or rough bore. In a purely reaming 
tool this is permitted, but it is not good in tools that have to initiate 
the hole. 

This brings us to the large class of boring tools which are supported 
at each end by being held in bars carried between centres. There 
are two main varieties: in one the cutters are fixed directly in 
the bar (fig. 13, A to D), in the other in a head fitted on the bar

(fig. 13, E), hence termed a "boring head." As lathe heads are 
fixed^ the traverse cannot be imparted to the bars as in boring 
machines. The boring heads can be traversed, or the work can be

traversed by the* mechanism of the lathe saddle. The latter must be 
done when cutters are fixed m bars. A great deal of difference 
exists in the details of the fittings both of bars and heads, but they 
are not so arbitrary as they might seem at first sight. The principal 
differences are those due to the number of cutters used, their shapes, 
and their method of fastening. Bars receiving their cutters direct 
include one, two or four, cutting on opposite sides, and therefore 
balanced. Four give better balance than two, the cutters being 
set at right angles. If a rough hole runs out of truth, a single cutter 
is better than a double-ended one, provided a tool of the roughing 
shape^ is used. The shape of the tools varies from roughing to 
finishing, and their method of attachment is by screws, wedges or 
nuts, but we cannot illustrate the numerous differences that are 
met with. 

Saws, — The saws are a natural connecting link between the chisels 
and the milling cutters. Saws are used for wood, metal and stone. 

Slabs of steel several inches 
A ^1 s\ S\ in thickness are sawn 

through as readily as, 
though more slowly than, 
timber planks. Circular 
and band saws are common 
in the smithy and the 
boiler and machine shops 
for cutting off bars, forgings 
and rolled sections. But 
the tooth shapes are not 
those used for timber, nor is 
the cutting speed the same. 
In the individual saw-teeth 
both cutting and scraping 
actions are illustrated (fig. 
14), Saws which cut tim- 
ber continuously with the 
grain, as rip, hand, band, 
circular, have incisive teeth. 
For though many are desti- 
tute of front rake, the 
method of sharpening at 
an angle imparts a true 
shearing cut. But all cross- 
cutting teeth scrape only, 
the teeth being either of 
triangular or of M-form, 
variously modified. Teeth 
for metal cutting also act 
strictly by scraping. The 
pitching of the teeth is 
. related to the nature of 
the^ material and the 
for timber than for metal

direction of ^ cutting. It is coarser iui umuer man ior n 
coarser for ripping or sawing with the grain than for cross cutting! 
coarser for soft than for hard woods. The setting of teeth, 
or the bending over to right and left, by which the clearance is 
provided for the blade of the saw, is subject to similar variations. 
It is greatest for soft woods and least for metals, where in 
fact the clearance is often secured without set, by merely thinning 
the blade backwards. But it is greater for cross cutting than for 



ripping timber. Gulleting follows similar rules. The softer the 
timber, the greater the gulleting, to permit the dust to escape freely. 
Milling Cutters. — Between a circular sawfor cutting metal and 
a thin milling cutter there is no essential difference. Increase the 
thickness as if to produce a very wide saw, and the essential plain 
edge milling cutter for metal results. ^ In its simplest form the 
milling cutter is a cylinder with teeth lying across its periphery, or 
parallel with its axis — the edge mill (fig. 15), or else a disk with teeth 
radiating on its face, or at right angles with its axis — the end mill 
(fig. 16). Each is used indifferently for producing flat faces and 
edges, and for cutting grooves which are rectangular in cross-section. 
These milling cutters invade the province of the single-edged tools 
of the planer, shaper and slotter. Of these two typical forms the

changes are rung in great variety, ranging from the narrow slitting 
tools which saw off bars, to the broad cutters of 24 in. or more in 
width, used on piano-millers. 

When more than about an inch in width, surfacing cylindrical 
cutters are formed with spiral teeth (fig. 15, B), a device which is

essential to sweetness of operation, the action being that of shearing. 
These have their teeth cut on universal machines, using the dividing 
and spiral head and suitable change wheels, and after hardening 
they are sharpened on universal grinders. When cutters exceed 
about 6 in. in length the difficulties of hardening and grinding render 
the " gang " arrangement more suitable. Thus, two, three or more 
similar edge mills are set end to end on an arbor, with the spiral 
teeth running in reverse directions, giving a broad face with balanced 
endlong cutting forces. From these are built up the numerous 
gang mills, comprising plane faces at right angles with each other, 
of which the straddle mills are the best known (fig. 17, A). A 
common element in these combinations is the key seat type B having 
teeth on the periphery and on both faces as in fig. 15, C, D. By 
these combinations half a dozen faces or more can be tooled simul- 
taneously, and all alike, as long as the mills retain their edge. The 
advantages over the work of the planer in this class of work are seen 
in tooling the faces and edges of machine tables, beds and slides, in 
shaping the faces and edges of caps to fit their bearing blocks. In 
a single cutter of the face type, but having teeth on back and edge 
also, T-slots are readily milled (fig. 16, D) ; this if done on the planer 
would require re-settings of awkwardly cranked tools, and more 
measurement and testing with templets than is required on a 
milling machine. 

When angles, curves and profile sections are introduced, the 
capacity of the milling cutter is infinitely increased. The making 
of the cutters is also more difficult. Angular cutters (fig. 18) are 
used for producing the teeth of the mills themselves, for shaping 
the teeth of ratchet wheels, and, in combination with straight cutters 
in gangs, for angular sections. With curves, or angles and curves 
in combination, taps, reamers and drills can be fluted or grooved, 

the teeth of wheels shaped, and in 
fact any outlines imparted (fig. 19). 
Here the work of the fitter, as well 
as that .of the planing and allied 
machines, is^ invaded, for much of 
this work if prepared on these 
machines would have to be finished 
laboriously by the file. 

There are two ways in which 
milling cutters are used, by which 
their value is extended; one is to 
transfer some of their work proper 
to the lathe and boring machine, 
the other is by duplication. A 
good many light circular sections, 
as wheel rims, hitherto done in lathes, are regularly prepared in 
the milling machine, gang mills being used for tooling the peri- 
phery and edges at once, and the wheel blank being rotated. 
Similarly, holes are bored by a rotating mill of the cylindrical type. 
Internal screw threads are done similarly. Duplication occurs 
when milling sprocket wheels in line, or side by side, in milling nuts 
on an arbor, in milling a number of narrow faces arranged side by 
side, in cutting the teeth of several spur-wheels on one arbor and 
in milling the teeth of racks several at a time. 

One of the greatest advances in the practice of milling was that 
of making backed-off cutters. The sectional shape behind the tooth

B, Concave Cutter.

facets continued identical in form with the profile of the edge, the 
outline being carried back as a curve equal in radius to that of the 
cutting edge (fig. 20). The 
result is that the cutter may 
be sharpened on the front 
faces of the teeth without 
interfering with the shape 
which will be milled, because 
the periphery^ always con- 
stant in outline. After re- 
peated sharpenings the teeth 
would assume the form indi- 
cated, by the shaded portion 
on two of the teeth. The 
limit of grinding is reached 
when the tooth becomes too 
thin and weak to stand up to its work. But such cutters will endure 
weeks or months of constant service before becoming useless. The

of the teeth back at the required radius. Relieved cutters can of 
course be strung together on a single arbor to form gang mills, by 
which very complicated profiles may be tooled, beyond the capacity 
of a single solid mill. 

Scrapes. — The tools which operate by scraping (fig. 21) include 
many of the broad finishing tools of the turner in wood and metal 
(cf. fig. 2), and the scrape of the wood worker and the fitter. The 
practice of scraping surfaces true, applied to surface plates, machine 
slides and similar objects, was due to Sir Joseph Whitworth. It 
superseded the older and less accurate^ practice of grinding to a 
mutual fit. Now, with machines of precision, the practice of grinding 
has to a large extent displaced the more costly scraping. Scraping 
is, however, the only method available when the most perfect contact 
is desired. Its advantage lies in the fact that the efforts of the work- 
man can be localized over the smallest areas, and nearly infinitesimal 
amounts removed, a mere fine dust in the last stages. 

Files. — These must in strictness be classed with scrapes, for, 
although the points are keen, there is never any front rake. Collec- 
tively there is'a shearing action because the rows of teeth are cut 
diagonally. The sectional forms (fig. 22) and the longitudinal 
forms (fig. 23) of the files are numerous, to adapt them to all classes 
of work. In addition, the method of cutting, 
and the degrees of coarseness of the teeth, vary, 
being single, or float cut, or double cut (fig. 24). 
The rasps are another group. Degrees of coarse- 
ness are designated as rough, middle cut, bastard 
cut, second cut, smooth, double dead smooth; 
the first named is the coarsest, the last the 
finest. The terms are relative, since the larger 
a file is the coarser are its teeth, though of the 
same name as the teeth in a shorter file, which 
are finer. 

Screwing Tools. — The forms of these will be 
found discussed under Screw. They can scarcely 
be ranked among cutting tools, yet the best kinds 
remove metal with ease. This is due in great 
measure to the good clearance allowed, and to 
the narrowness of the cutting portions. Front 
rake is generally absent, though in some of the 
best screwing dies there is a slight amount. 

Shears and Punches. — These maybe of cutting 

or non-cutting types. Shears (fig. 25) have no 

front rake, but only a slight clearance. They 

slight shearing cut, because the blades do not

generally give a _ 

lie parallel, but the cutting begins at one end and continues in detail 

to the other. But strictly the shears, like the punches, act by a

severe detrusive effort; for the punch, with its bolster (fig. 26), 
forms a pair of cylindrical shears. Hence a shorn or punched 
edge is always rough, ragged, and covered with minute, shallow 
cracks. Both processes are therefore dangerous to iron and steel. 
The metal being unequally stressed, fracture starts in the annulus 
of metal. Hence the advantage of the practice of reamering.out 
this annulus, which is completely removed by enlargement by 
about an \ in. diameter, so that homogeneous metal is left throughout 
the entire unpunched section. The same results follow reamering 
both in iron and steel. Annealing, according to many experiments, 
has the same effect as reamering, due to the rearrangement of the 
molecules of metal. The perfect practice with punched plates 
is to punch, reamer, and finally to anneal. The effect of shearing 
is practically identical with that of punching, and planing and 
annealing shorn edges has the same influence as reamering and 
annealing punched holes. 

Hammers. — These form an immense group, termed percussive, 
from the manner of their use (fig. 27). Every trade has its own 
peculiar shapes, the total of which number many scores, each with 
its own appropriate name, and ranging in size from the minute 
forms of the^ jeweler to the sledges of the smith and boiler maker 
and the planishing hammers of the coppersmith. Wooden hammers 
are termed mallets, their purpose being to avoid bruising tools or 
the surfaces of work. Most trades use mallets of some form or 
another. Hammer handles are rigid in all cases except certain 
percussive tools of the smithy, which are handled with withy rods, 
or iron rods flexibly attached to the tools, so that when struck by 
the sledge they shall not jar the hands. The fullering tools, and 
flatters, and setts, though not hammers strictly, are actuated by 



Cercussion. The dies of the die forgers are actuated percussively, 
eiog closed by powerful hammers. The action of caulking tools 
is percussive, and so is that of moulders' rammers.

Moulding Tools. — This is a group of tools which, actuated either 
by simple pressure or percussively, mould, shape and model forms 
in the sand of the moulder, in the metal of the smith, and inpress 
work. All the tools of the moulder (fig. 28) with the exception of 
the rammers and vent wires act by moulding the sand into shapes

by pressure. Their contours correspond with the plane and curved 
surfaces of moulds, and with the requirements of shallow and deep 
work. They are made in iron and brass. _ The fullers, swages and 
flatters of the smith, and the dies used with hammer and presses, 
all mould by percussion or by pressure, the work taking the counter- 
part of the dies, or of some portion of them. The practice of die 
forging consists almost wholly of moulding processes. 

Tool Steels. — These now include three kinds. The common 
steel, the controlling element in which is carbon, requires to be 
hardened and tempered, and must not be overheated, about 500° F. 
being the highest temperature permissible — the critical tempera- 
ture. Actually this is seldom allowed to be reached. The dis- 
advantage of this steel is that its capabilities are limited, because the 
heat generated by heavy cutting soon spoils the tools. The second 
is the Mushet steel, invented by R. F. Mushet in 1868^ a carbon 
steel, in which the controlling element is tungsten, of which it contains 
from about 5 to 8%. It is termed self-hardeningy because it is 
cooled in air instead of being quenched in water. Its value consists 
in its endurance at high temperatures, even at a low red heat. 
Until the advent of the high-speed steels, Mushet steel was 
reserved for all heavy cutting, and for tooling hard tough 
steels. It is made in six different tempers suitable for various 
kinds of duty. Tools of Mushet steel must not be forged below 
a red heat. It is hardened by reheating the end to a white heat, 
and blowing cold in an air blast. The third kind of steel is termed 
high-speedy because much higher cutting speeds are practicable 
with these than with other steels. Tools made of them are hardened 
in a blast of cold air. The controlling elements are numerous and 
vary in the practice of different manufacturers, to render the 



MACHINE TOOLS] 



TOOL 



21 



tools adaptable to cutting various classes of metals and alloys. 
Tungsten is the principal controlling element, but chromium is 
essential, and molybdenum and vanadium are often found of 
value. The steels are forged at a yellow tint, equal to about 
1850 F. They are raised to a white heat for hardening, and cooled 
in an air blast to a bright red. They are then often quenched in a 
bath of oil. 

The first public demonstration of the capacities of high speed 
steels was made at the Paris Exhibition of 1900. Since that time 
great advances have been made. It has been found that the 
section of the shaving limits the practicable speeds, so that, although 
cutting speeds of 300 and 400 ft. a minute are practicable with 
light cuts, it is more economical to limit speeds to less than 100 ft. 
per minute with ^ much heavier cuts. The use of water is not 
absolutely essential as in using tools of carbon steel. The new 
steels show to much greater advantage on mild steel than on cast 
iron. They are more useful for roughing down than for finishing. 
The removal of 20 lb of cuttings per minute with a single tool 
is common, and that amount is often exceeded, so that a lathe 
soon becomes half buried in turnings unless they are carted away. 
The horse-power absorbed is proportionately large. Ordinary 
heavy lathes will take from 40 to 60 h.p. to drive them, or from 
four to six times more than is required by lathes of the same centres 
using carbon steel tools. Many remarkable records have been 
given of the capacities of the new steels. Not only turning and 
planing toolsbut drills and milling cutters are now regularly made 
of them. It is a revelation to see these drills in their rapid descent 
through metal. A drill of 1 in. in diameter will easily go through 
5 in. thickness of steel in one minute. 

Machine Tools 
The machine tools employed in modern engineering factories 
number many hundreds of well-defined and separate types. 
Besides these, there are hundreds more designed for special 
functions, and adapted only to the work of firms who handle 
specialities. Most of the first named and many of the latter admit 
of grouping in classes. The following is a natural classification: 

I. Turning Lathes. — These, by common consent, stand as a 
class alone. The cardinal feature by which they are distin- 
guished is that the work being operated on rotates against a 
tool which is held in a rigid fixture — the rest. The axis of 
rotation may be horizontal or vertical. 

II. Reciprocating Machines. — The feature by which these 
are characterized is that the relative movements of tool and 
work take place in straight lines, to and fro. The recipro- 
cations may occur in horizontal or vertical planes. 

III. Machines which Drill and Bore Holes. — These have some 
features in common with the lathes, inasmuch as drilling and 
boring are often- done in the lathes, and some facing and turning 
in the drilling and boring machines, but they have become 
highly differentiated. In the foregoing groups tools having 
either single or double cutting edges are used. 

IV. Milling Machines. — This group uses cutters having 
teeth arranged equidistantly round a cylindrical body, and 
may therefore be likened to saws of considerable thickness. 
The cutters rotate over or against work, between which and the 
cutters a relative movement of travel takes place, and they may 
therefore be likened to reciprocating machines, in which a 
revolving cutter takes the place of a single-edged one. 

V. Machines for Cutting the Teeth of Gear-wheels. — These 
comprise two sub-groups, the older type in which rotary milling 
cutters are used, and the later type in which reciprocating 
single-edged tools are employed. Sub-classes are designed for 
one kind of gear only, as spur-wheels, bevels, worms, racks, 
&c. 

VI. Grinding Machinery. — This is a large and constantly 
extending group, largely the development of recent years. 
Though emery grinding has been practised in crude fashion for 
a century, the difference in the old and the new methods lies 
in the embodiment of the grinding wheel in machines of high 
precision, and in the rivalry of the wheels of corundum, car- 
borundum and alundum, prepared in the electric furnace with 
those of emery. 

VII. Sawing Machines. — In modern practice these take an 
important part in cutting iron, steel and brass. Few shops 
are without them, and they are numbered by dozens in some 
establishments. They include circular saws for hot and cold 
metal, band saws and hack saws. 



VIII. Shearing and Punching Machines. — These occupy a 
border line between the cutting and non-cutting tools. Some 
must be classed with the first, others with the second. The 
detrusive action also is an important element, more especially 
in the punches. 

IX. Hammers and Presses. — Here there is a percussive action 
in the hammers, and a purely squeezing one in the presses. 
Both are made capable of exerting immense pressures, but the 
latter are far more powerful than the former. 

X. Portable Tools. — This large group can best be classified 
by the common feature of being readily removable for operation 
on large pieces of erection that cannot be taken to the regular 
machines. Hence they are all comparatively small and light. 
B roadly they include diverse tools, capable of performing 
nearly the whole of the operations summarized in the pre- 
ceding paragraphs. 

XI. Appliances. — There is a very large number of articles 
which are neither tools nor machine tools, but which are in- 
dispensable to the work of these; that is, they do not cut, or 
shape, or mould, but they hold, or grip, or control, or aid in 
some way or other the carrying through of the work. Thus 
a screw wrench, an angle plate, a wedge, a piece of packing, a 
bolt, are appliances. In modern practice the appliance in 
the form of a templet or jig is one of the principal elements 
in the interchangeable system. 

XII. Wood-working Machines, — This group does for the 
conversion of timber what the foregoing accomplish for metal. 
There is therefore much underlying similarity in many machines 
for wood and metal, but still greater differences, due to the 
conditions imposed on the one hand by the very soft, and on the 
other by the intensely hard, materials operated on in the two 
great groups. 

XIII. Measurement. — To the scientific engineer, equally 
with the astronomer, the need for accurate measurement is of 
paramount importance. Neither good fitting nor interchange- 
ability of parts is possible without a system of measurement, 
at once accurate and of ready and rapid application. Great 
advances have been made in this direction lately. 

I. — LathesJ 

The popular conception of a lathe, derived from the familiar 
machine of the wood turner, would not give a correct idea of the 
lathe which has been developed as the engineer's machine tool. 
This has become differentiated into nearly fifty well-marked.types, 
until in some cases even the term lathe has been dropped for more 
precise definitions, as vertical boring machine, automatic machine, 
while in others prefixes are necessary, as axle lathe, chucking lathe, 
cutting-off lathe, wheel lathe, and so on. With regard to size and 
mass the height of centres may range from 3 in. in the bench lathes 
to 9 or 10 ft. in gun lathes, and weights will range from say 50 lb 
to 200 tons, or more in exceptional -eases. While in some the 
mechanism is the simplest possible, in others it is so complicated 
that only the specialist is able to grasp its details. 

Early Lathes. — Space will not permit us to trace the evolution 
of the lathe from the ancient bow and card lathe and the pole 
lathe, in each of which the rotary movement was alternately for- 
ward, for cutting, and backward. The curious thing is that the 
wheel-driven lathe was a novelty so late as the 14th and 15th 
centuries, and had not wholly displaced the ancient forms even in 
the West in the 19th century, and the cord lathe still survives in 
the East. Another thing is that all the old lathes were of dead 
centre, instead of running mandrel type; and not until 1794 did the 
use of metal begin to take the place of wood in lathe construction. 
Henry Maudslay (1771-1831) did morethan any other man to 
develop the engineer's self-acting lathe in regard to its essential 
mechanism, but it was, like _ its immediate successors for fifty 
years after, a skeleton-like, inefficient weakling by comparison 
with the lathes of the present time. 

Broad Types. — A ready appreciation of the broad differences in 
lathe types may be obtained by considering the differences in the 
great groups of work on which lathes are designed to operate. 
Castings and forgings that are turned in lathes vary not only in 
size, but also in^ relative dimensions. Thus a long piece of driving 
shafting, or a railway axle, is very differently proportioned in length 
and diameter from a railway wheel or a wheel tire. Further, while 
the shaft has to be turned only, the wheel or the tire has to be 
turned and bored. Here then we have the first cardinal distinction 
between lathes, viz. those admitting work between centres (fig. 29) 
and face and boring lathes. In the first the piece of work is pivoted 
and driven between the centres of head-stock and tail-stock or loose 
poppet; in the second, it is held and gripped only by the dogs or 



22 



TOOL 



[LATHES 



jaws of a face-plate, on the head-stock spindle, the loose 
poppet being omitted. 

These, however, are broad types only, since proportions 
of length to diameter differ, and with them lathe designs 
are modified whenever there js a sufficient amount of work 
of one class to justify the laying down of a special machine 
or machines to deal with it. Then further, we have dupli- 
cate designs, in which, for example, provision is made in 
one lathe for turning two or three long shafts simultane- 
ously, or for turning and boring two wheels or tires at 
once. Further^the position of the axis of a face lathe 
need not be horizontal, as is necessary when the turning 
of long pieces lias to be done between centres. There are 
obvious advantages^ in arranging it vertically, the princi- 
pal being that castings and forcings can be more easily 
set and secured to a horizontal chuck than to one the face 
of which lies vertically. The chuck is also better sup- 
ported, and higher rates of turning are practicable. In 
recent years these vertical lathes or vertical turning and ■ 
boring mills (fig. 30) have been greatly increasing in num- 
bers; they also occur in several designs to suit either 
general or special duties, some of them being used for 
boring only, as chucking lathes. Some are of immense 
size, capable of # boring the field magnets of electric 
generators 40 ft. in diameter. 

Standard Lathes, — But for doing what is termed 
the general work of the engineer's turnery, the stan- 
dard lathes (fig. 29) predominate, ue. self-acting, sliding 
and surfacing lathes with headstock, loose poppet and 
slide-rest, centres, face plates and chucks, and an equip- 
ment by which long pieces are turned, either between 
centres or on the face chucks, and bored. One of 
the greatest objections to the employment of these 
standard types of lathes for indiscriminate duty is due 
to the limited height of the centres or axis of the head- 
stock, above the face of the bed. This is met generally 
by providing a pap or deep recess in the bed next 
the fast headstock', deep enough to take face work of 
large diameter. The device is very old and very common, 
but when the volume of work warrants the employment 
of separate lathes for face-work and for that done 
between centres it is better to have them. 

Screw-cutting. — A most important section of the work 
of the engineer's turnery is that of cutting screws (see 
Screw). This has resulted in differentiation fully as 
great as that existing between centres and face-work. 
The slide-rest was designed with this object, though 
it is also used for plain turning. The standard " self- 
acting sliding, surfacing and screw-cutting lathe " is 
essentially the standard turning lathe, with the addi- 
tion of the screw-cutting mechanism. This includes a 
master screw — the lead or guide screw, which is 
gripped with a clasp nut, fastened to the travelling 
carnage of the slide-rest. The lead-screw is connected 
to the headstock spindle by change wheels, which are 
the variables through which the relative rates of move- 
ment of the spindle and the lead-screw, and therefore 
of the screw-cutting tool, held and traversed in the 
slide-rest, are effected. By this beautiful piece of 
mechanism a guide screw, the pitch of which is per- 
manent, is made to cut screw-threads of an almost 
infinite number of possible pitches, both in whole and 
fractional numbers, by virtue of rearrangements of 
the variables, the change wheels. The objection to 
this method is that the trains of change wheels have 
to be recalculated and rearranged as often as a screw 
of a different pitch has to be cut, an operation which 
takes some little time. To avoid this, the nest or 
cluster system of gears has been largely adopted, its 
most successful embodiment being in the Hendey- 
Norton lathe. Here all the change wheels are arranged 
in a series permanently on one shaft underneath the 
headstock, and any one of them is put into engagement 
by a sliding ninion operated by the simple movement 
of a lever. Thus the lead-screw is driven at different 
rates without removing any wheel from its spindle. 
This has been extensively applied to both small and 
large lathes. But a moment's thought will show that 
even this device is too cumbrous when large numbers of 
small screws are required. There is, for example, little 
in common between the screw, say of 5 or 6 ft. in 
length, for a massive penstock or valve, and j-in. bolts, 
or the small screws required in thousands for electrical 
fittings. Clearly while the self-acting screw-cutting 
lathe is the best possible machine to use for the first, 
it is unsuitable for the last. So here at once, from the 
point of view of screw cutting only, an important diver- 
gence takes place, and one which has ultimately led 
to very high specialization.

large quantities, the guide-screw and change wheels give place to other 
devices, one of which involves the use of a separate master-screw 
for every different pitch, the other that of encircling cutting in- 
struments or dies. The first are represented by the chasing lathe, 
the second by the screwing lathes and automatics. Though the 
principles of operation are thus stated in brief, the details in design 
are most extensive and varied. 

In a chasing lathe the master-screw or hob, which may be either 
at the rear of the headstock or in front of the slide-rest, receives 
a hollow clasp-nut or a half-nut, or a star-nut containing several 
pitches, which, partaking of the traverse movement of the screw- 
thread, imparts the same horizontal movement to the cutting tool. 
The latter is sometimes carried in a hinged holder, sometimes in 
a common slide-rest. The attendant throws it into engagement 
at the beginning of a traverse, and out when completed, and also 



this is an economical system, but in others not. It cannot be 
considered so when bolts, screws and allied forms are of small 
dimensions. 

Hollow Mandrel Lathes. — It has been the growing practice since 
the last decade of the 19th century to produce short articles, re- 
quired in large quantities, from a long bar. This involves making 
the lathe with a hollow mandrel; that is, the mandrel of the head- 
stock has a hole drilled right through it, large enough to permit 
of the passage through it of the largest bar which the class of work 
requires. Thus, if the largest section of the finished pieces should 
require a bar of ii in. diameter, the hole in the mandrel would be 
made if in. Then the bar, inserted from the rear-end, is gripped 
by a chuck or collet at the front, the operations of turning, screwing 
and cutting off done, and the bar then thrust farther through 
to the exact length for the next set of identical operations to be

changes the hobs for threads of different sections. The screwed 
stays cf locomotive fire-boxes are almost invariably cut on chasing 
lathes of this class. 

In the screwing machines the thread is cut with dies, which 
encircle the rotating bar; or alternatively the dies rotate round a 
fixed pipe, and generally the angular lead or advance of the thread 
draws the dies' along. These dies differ in no essentials from similar 
tools operated by a hand lever at the bencru There are many 
modifications of these lathes, because the work is so highly special- 
ized that they are seldom used for anything except the work of 
cutting screws varying but little in dimensions. Such being the 
case they can hardly be classed as lathes, and are often _ termed 
screwing machines, because no provision exists for preliminary 
turning work, which is then done elsewhere, the task of turning 
and threading being divided between two lathes* In some cases

performed, and so on. This mechanism is termed a wire feed, because 
the first lathes which were built of this type only operated on large 
wires; the heavy bar lathes have been subsequently developed 
from it. In the more ad vanced_ types of lathes this feeding through 
the hollow spindle does not require the intervention of the attendant, 
but is performed automatically. 

The amount of preliminary work which has to be done upon a 
portion of a bar before it is ready for screwing varies. The simplest 
object is a stud, which is a parallel piece screwed up from each end. 
A bolt is a screw with a head of hexagonal, square or circular 
form, and the production of this involves turning the shank and 
shoulder and imparting convexity to the end, as well as screwing. 
But screw-threads have often to be cut on objects which are not 
primarily bolts, but which are spindles of various^ kinds used on 
mechanisms and machine tools, and in which reductions in the form

of steps have to be made, and recesses, or flanges, or other features 
produced. Out of the demands for this more complicated work, 
as well as for plain bolts and studs, has arisen the great group of 
turret or capstan lathes (fig. $i) and the automatics or automatic 
screw machines which are a high development of the turret lathes. 



Turret Lathes. — The turret or capstan (fig.32) is a device for grip-

in due succession, each one doing its little share of work, until the 
cycle of operations required to produce the object is complete, 
the cycle including such operations as turning and screwing, rough- 
ing and finishing cuts, drilling and boring. Severance of the finished 
piece is generally done by a tool or tools held by a cross-slide between 
the headstock and turret, so termed because its movements take 
place at right angles with the axis of the machine. This also 
of ten performs the duty of " forming," by which is meant the shap- 
ing of the exterior portion of an object of irregular outline, by a 
tool the edge of which is an exact counterpart of the profile required. 
The exterior of a cycle hub is shaped thus, as also are numerous 
handles and other objects involving various curves and shoulders, 
&c. The tool is fed perpendicularly to the axis of the rotat- 
ing work and completes outlines at once; if this were done in 
ordinary lathes much tedious manipulation of separate tools would 
be involved. 

Automatics. — But the marvel of the modern automatics (fig. 33) 
lies in the mechanism by which the cycle of operations is rendered 
absolutely independent of attendance, beyond the first adjustments 
and the insertion of a fresh bar as often as the previous one becomes 
used up. The movements of the rotating turret and of the cross- 
slide, and the feeding of the bar through the hollow spindle, take 
place within a second, at the conclusion of. the operation preceding. 
These movements are effected by a set of mechanism independent 
of that by which the headstock spindle is rotated, viz. by cams 
or cam drums on a horizontal cam shaft, or other equivalent 
device, differing much in arrangement, but not principle. Move- 
ments are hastened or retarded, or pauses of some moments may 
ensue, according to the cam arrangements devised, which of course 
have to be varied for pieces of different proportions and dimensions. 
But when the machines with their tools are once set up, they will 
run for days or weeks, repeating precisely the same cycle of opera- 
tions; they are self-lubricating, and only require to be fed with 
fresh lengths of bar and to have their tools resharpened occasionally. 
Of these automatics alone there are something like a dozen distinct 
types, some with their turrets vertical, others horizontal. Not 
only so but the use of a single spindle is not always deemed suffi- 
ciently economical, and some of these designs now have two, three 
and four separate work spindles grouped in one head.

number, andthey include the usual provisions for ordinary turning. 
In some designs change wheels are made use of for imparting a 
definite movement of cross traverse to the tool, which being com- 
pounded with the parallel sliding movements produces the taper, 
In others an upper bed carrying the heads and work swivels on a 
lower bed, which carries the slide rest. More often tapers are 
turned by a cross adjustment of the loose poppet, or by a taper 
attachment at the rear of the lathe, which coerces the movement 
of the top or tool-carrying slide of the rest. Or, as in short tapers, 
the slide-rest is set to the required angle on its carriage. Balls 
are sometimes turned by a spherical attachment to the slide-rest 
of an ordinary lathe. Copying lathes are those in which an object 
is reproduced from a pattern precisely like the objects required. 
The commonest example is that in which gun-stocks and the spokes 
of wheels are turned, but these are used for timber, and the engineer's 
copying latheuses a form or cam and a milling cutter. The form 
milling machine is the copying machine for metal-work. The 
manufacture of boilers has given birth to two kinds of lathes, one 
for turning the boiler ends, the other the boiler flue flanges, the 
edges of which have to be caulkecL Shaft pulleys have appropriated 
a special lathe containing provision for turning the convexity of 
the faces. Lathes are duplicated in two or three ways. Two, 
four, six or eight tools sometimes operate simultaneously on a piece 
of work. Two lathes are mounted on one bed. A tool will be boring 
a hole while another is turning the edges of the same wheel. One 
will be boring, another turning a wheel tire, and so on. The rolls 
for iron and steel mills have special lathes for trueing them up. 
The thin sheet metal-work produced by spinning has given rise to 
a special kind of spinning lathe where pressure, and not cutting, 
is the method adopted. 

Methods of Holding and Rotating Work. Chucks. — The term chuck 
signifies an appliance used in the lathe to hold and rotate work. 
As the dimensions and shapes of the latter vary extensively, so 
also do those of the chucks. Broadly, however, the latter corre- 
spond with the two principal classes of work done in the lathe, 
that between centreSy and that held at one end only or face work. 



This of course is an extremely comprehensive classification, because 
chucks of the same name differ vastly when used in small and large 
lathes. The chucks, again, used in turret work, though they grip 
the work by one_end only, differ entirely in design from the face 
chucks proper. 

Chucking between Centres. — The simplest and by far the commonest 
method adopted is to drill countersunk centres at the ends of the 
work to be turned, in the centre or longitudinal axis (fig, 34, A), 
and support these on the point centres of headstock and poppet. 
The angle included by the centres is usually 6o°, and the^ points 
may enter the work to depths ranging from as little as A- in.^ in very 
light pieces to £ in., J in. or 1 in. in the heaviest. Obviously a 
piece centred thus cannot be rotated by the mere revolution of the 
lathe, but it has to be driven by some other agent making con-

nexion between it and the mandrel. The wood turner uses a forked 
or prong centre to obtain the necessary leverage at the headstock 
ena, but that would be useless in metal. A driver is therefore used, 
of which there are several forms (fig. 34), the essential element 
being a short stiff prong of metal set away from the centre, and rotat- 
ing the work directly, or against a carrier which encircles and 
pinches the work. As this method of driving sets up an unbalanced 
force, the " Clement " or double driver (fig. 34, D), was invented, 
and is frequently made use of, though not nearly so much as the 
common single driver. In large and heavy work it is frequently 
the practice to drive in another way, by the dogs of the face-plate. 
Steadies. — Pieces of work which are rigid enough to withstand 
the stress of cutting do not require any support except the centres.

the carriage of the slide-rest and move along with it — travelling

steadies. In some the work is steadied in a vee, or a- right angle, 
in others adjustable pins or arms are brought into contact with it. 
As the pressure of the cut would cause an upward as well as back- 
ward yielding of the work, these two movements are invariably 
provided against, no matter in what ways the details of the steadies 
are worked out. Before a steady can be used, a hghtcut has to 
be taken in the locality where the steady has to take its bearing, 
to render the work true in that place. The travelling steady 
follows immediately behind the tool, coming in contact therefore 
with finished work continually. 

Mandrels.- -Some kinds of work are earned between centres 
indirectly, upon mandrels or arbors (fig. 36). This is the method

Fig. 36. — Mandrels. 

A, Plain mandrel. B, Stepped mandrel. C, Expanding mandrel, 
adopted when wheels, pulleys, bushes and similar articles arc bored 
first and turned afterwards, being chucked by the bore hole, which 
fits on a mandrel. The latter is then driven between point centres 
and the bore fits the mandrel sufficiently tightly to resist the stress 
of turning. The large number of bores possible involves stocking 
a considerable number of mandrels of different diameters. As it 
is not usual to turn a mandrel as often as a piece of work requires 
chucking, economy is studied by the use of stepped mandrels, which 
comprise several diameters, say from three to a dozen. A better 
device is the expanding mandrel, of which there are several forms. 
The essential principle in all is the capacity for slight adjustments 
in diameter, amounting to from i in. to J in., by the utilization 
of a long taper. A split, springy cylinder may be moved endwise 
over a tapered body, or separate single keys or blades may be 
similarly moved. 

Face-Work. — That kind of work in which support is given at the 
headstock end only, the centre of the movable poppet not being 
required, is known as face-work. It includes pieces the length of 
which ranges from something less than the diameter to about 
three or four times the diameter, the essential condition being that 
the unsupported end shall be sufficiently steady to resist the stress 
of cutting. Work which has to be bored, even though long, cannot 
be steadied on the back centre, and if long is often supported on 
a cone plate. The typical appliance used for face-work is the common 
face-plate (fig. 37). It is a plain disk, screwed on the mandrel

A y Screwed hole to fit mandrel nose. B, Slots for common bolts. 

C, Tee-slots for tee-head bolts, 
nose, and having slot holes in which bolts are inserted for the pur- 
pose of cramping pieces of work to its face. There are numerous 
forms of these clamps, and common bolts also are used. The face- 
plate may also serve to receive an intermediary, the angle-plate, 
against which work may be bolted when its shape is such as to 
render bolting directly to the plate inconvenient. 

Jaw Chucks. — When a face-plate has fitted to it permanent dogs 
or jaws it is termed a dog or jaw chuck (fig. 38). In the commonest 
form the jaws are moved radially and independently, each by 
its own screw, to grip work either externally or internally. In 
some cases the dogs are loosely fitted to the holes in a plain face- 
plate. In all these types the radial setting is tentative, that is, 



the jaws being independent, there is no self-centring capacity, and 
thus much time is lost. A large group, therefore, are rendered 
self-centring by the turning of a ring which actuates a face scroll

(fig. 39) or a circular rack with 
pinions (fig. 40), turned with 
a key which operates all the 
jaws simultaneously inwards 
or outwards. But as some 
classes of jobs have to be 
adjusted eccentrically, _ many 
chucks are of the combination 
type (fig. 40), capable of being 
used independently or con- 
centrically, hence termed uni- 
versal chucks. The change 
from one to the other simply 
means throwing the ring of 
teeth out of or into engage- 
ment with the pinions by 
means of cams or equivalent 
devices. Each type of chuck 
occurs in a large range of 
dimensions to suit lathes of all 
centres, besides which every 
lathe includes several chucks, 
large and small, in its equip- 
ment. The range of dia- 
meters which can be^ taken 
by any one chuck is limited, 
though the jaws are made 
with steps, in addition to the 
range afforded by the ope- 
rating screws. The " Taylor " 
spiral chucks (fig. 41) differ 



TOOL 



27 



essentially from the scroll types in having the actuating threads set spirally 
on the sloping interior of a cone. The result is that the outward pressure 
of each jaw is received behind the body, because the spiral rises up at the 
back. In the ordinary scroll chucks the pressure is taken only at the bottom 
of each jaw, and the tendency to tilt and pull the teeth out of shape is very 
noticeable. The spiral, moreover, enables a stronger form of tooth to be used, 
together with a finer pitch of threads, so that the wearing area can be 
increased. 

The foregoing may be termed the standard chucks. But in addition there 
arc large numbers for dealing with special classes of work. Brass finishers 
have several. Most of the hollow spindle lathes and automatics have draw-in 
or gush-out chucks, in which the jaws are operated simultaneously by the 
conical bore of the encircling nose, so that their action is instantaneous and 
self-centring. They are either operated by hand, as in fig. 31, or automatically, 
as in fig. 33. There is also a large group used for drills and reamers — the drill 
chucks employed in lathes as well as in drilling machines. 

II. — Reciprocating Machine Tools 
This is the only convenient head under which to group three great classes of 

machine tools which possess the feature of reciprocation in common. It 

includes the planing, shaping and slotting machines. The feature of reciproca- 
tion is that the cutting tool is operative only in one direction; that is, it cuts 

during one stroke or movement and is idle during the return stroke. It is, 

therefore, in precisely the same condition as a hand tool such as a chisel, a 

carpenter's plane or a hand 

saw. We snail return again 

to this feature of an idle 

stroke and discuss the devices 

that exist to avoid it. 
Planing Machines. — In the 

standard planer for general 

shop purposes (fig. 42) the 

piece of work to be operated 

on is attached to a horizontal o 

table moving to and fro on a 

rigid bed, and passing under- 
neath the^ fixed cutting tool. 

The tool is gripped in a box 

having certain necessary'ad- 

justments and movements, so 

that the tool can be carried 

or fed transversely across the 

work f> or at right angles with 

the direction of its travel, to 

take successive cuts, and also 

downwards or in a vertical 

direction. The tool-box is 

carried on a cross-slide which 

has capacity for several feet 

of vertical adjustment on up- f^-v ■ -™ %*} 

right members to suit work Vfy ^"'.^-' 

of varying depths. These up- (J] ^ 

rights or housings are bolted 

to the sides of the bed, and 

the whole framing is so rigidly 

designed that no perceptible 

tremor or yielding takes place 

under the heaviest duty im- 
posed by the stress of cutting.

[RECIPROCATING MACHINES 



Moreover, after the required adjustments have been made and the 
machine started, the travel and the return of the work-table and 
the feeding of the tool across the surface are performed by self-acting 
mechanism actuated by the reciprocations of the table itself, the 
table being driven from the belt pulleys. 



To such a design there are objections, which, though their im- 
portance has often been exaggerated, are yet real. First, the cross- 
rail and housings make a rigid enclosure over the table, which 
sometimes prevents the admission of a piece that is too large to 
pass under the cross-rail or between the housings. Out of this

RECIPROCATING MACHINES] 



TOOL 



29 



objection has arisen a new design, the side planer (fig. 43), in which 
the tool-box is carried by an arrn movable along a fixed bed or base, 
and overhanging the work, which is fastened to the side of the 
base, or on angle brackets, or in a deep pit alongside. Here the 
important difference is that the work is not traversed under the 
tool as in the ordinary planer, but the tool moves over the work. 
But an evil results, due to the overhang of the tool arm, which being 
a cantilever supported at one end onlyis not so rigid when cutting 
as the cross-rail of the ordinary machine, supported at both ends 
on housings. The same idea is embodied in machines built in other 
respects on the reciprocating table model. Sometimes one housing 
is omitted, and the tool arm is carried on the other, being therefore 
unsupported at one end. Sometimes a housing is made to be 
removable at pleasure, to be temporarily taken away only when a 
piece of work of unusual dimensions has to be fixed on the table. 
Another objection to the common planer is this. It seems 
unmechanical in this machineto reciprocate a heavy table and 
piece of work which often weighs several tons, and let the tool 
and its holder of a few hundredweights only remain stationary. 
The mere reversal of the table absorbs much greater horse-power 



there is no limitation whatever to the length of the work, since it 
may extend to any distance beyond the base-plate. 

Shaping Machines. — The shaping machine (fig. 44) does for com- 
paratively small pieces that which the^ planer does for long ones. 
It came later in time than the planer, being one of James Nasmyth's 
inventions, and beyond the fact that it has a reciprocating non- 
cutting return stroke it bears no resemblance to the older machine. 
Its design is briefly as follows: The piece of work to be shaped is 
attached to the top, or one of the vertical side faces, of a right- 
angled bracket or brackets. These are carried upon the face of a 
main standard and are adjustable thereon in horizontal and vertical 
directions. In small machines the ram or reciprocating arm (see 
fig. 44, G) slides in fixed guides on the top of the pillar, and the 
necessary side traverse is imparted to the work table B. To the top 
of the main standard, in one design, a carriage is fitted with hori- 
zontal traverse to cover the whole breadth, within the capacity of the 
machine, of any work to be operated on. In the largest machines 
two standards support a long bed, on which the carriage, with its 
ram, traverses past the work. These machines are frequently made 
double-headed, that is carriages, rams and work tables are dupli-

than the actual work of cutting. Hence a strong case is often 
stated for the abandonment of the common practice. But, on the 
other hand, the centre of gravity of the moving table and work 
lies low down, while when the cross-rail and housings with the cut- 
ting tool are travelled and reversed, their centre of gravity is high, 
and great precautions have to be taken to ensure steadiness of 
movement. Several planers are made thus, but they are nearly 
all of extremely massive type — the pit planers. The device is 
seldom applied to those of small and medium dimensions. 

But there is a great group of planers in which the work is always 
fixed, the tools travelling. These are the wall planers, vertical 
planers or wall creepers, used chiefly by marine engine builders. 
They are necessary, because many of the castings and forgings 
are too massive to be put on the tables of the largest standard 
machines. They are therefore laid on the base-plate of the wall 
planer, and the tool-box travels up and down a tall pillar bolted to 
the wall or standing independently, and so makes vertical cutting 
strokes. In some designs horizontal strokes are provided for, or 
either vertical or horizontal as required. Here, as in the side planer,

cated, and the operator can set one piece of work while the other 
is being shaped. In all capes the movement of the reciprocating 
arm, to the outer end of which the tool is attached, takes placein a 
direction transversely to the direction of movement of the carriage, 
and the tool receives no support beyond that which it receives from 
the arm which overhangs the work.^ Hence the shaper labours 
under the same disadvantages as the side planer — it cannot operate 
over a great breadth. A shaper with a 24-in. stroke is one of large 
capacity, 16 in. being an average limit. Although the non-cutting 
stroke exists, as in the planer, the objection due to the mass of a 
reciprocating table does not exist, so that the problem does not 
assume the same magnitude as in the planer. The weak point in 
the shaper is the overhang of the arm, which renders it liable to 
spring, and renders heavy cutting difficult. Recently a novel 
design has been introduced to avoid this, the draw-cut shaper, in 
which the cutting is done on the inward or return stroke, instead of 
on the outward one. 

Slotting Machines. — In the slotting machine (fig. 45) the cutting 
takes place vertically and there is a lost return stroke. All the

necessary movements save the simple reciprocating stroke are im- 
parted to the compound table on which the work is carried. These 
include two linear movements at right angles with each other and 
a circular motion capable of making a complete circle. Frequently 
a tilting adjustment is included to permit of slotting at an angle. 
The slotting machine has the disadvantage of an arm unsupported 
beyond the guides in which it moves. But the compound movements 
of the table permit of the production of shapes which cannot be done 
on planers and shapers, as circular parts and circular arcs, in com- 
bination with straight portions. Narrow key^ grooves in the bores 
of wheels are also readily cut, the wheels lying on the horizontal 
table, which would only be possible on planer and shaper by the use 
of awkward angle brackets, and of specially projecting tools. 

Quick return in planers is accomplished by having two distinct 
sets of gearing — a slow set for cutting and a quick train for return, 
each operated from the same group of driving pulleys* The return 
travel is thus accomplished usually three, often four, times more 
quickly than the forward rate; sometimes even higher rates are 
arranged for. In the shaper 
and slotter such acceleration 
is not practicable, a rate of 
two to one being about the 
limit, and this is obtained not 
by gears, but by the slotted 
crank, the Whitworth return, 
on shapers and slotters, or by 
elliptical toothed wheels on 
slotters. The small machines 

are generally unprovided with 
this acceleration. 

The double-cutting device 
seems at first sight the best 
solution, and it is adopted on 

a number of machines, though 

still in a great minority. The 
pioneer device of this kind, 
the rotating tool-box of 
Whitworth, simply turns the 
tool round through an angle 

of 180 at the termination of 

each stroke, the movement 
being self-acting. In some 

later designs, instead of the 

box being rotated to reverse 

the tool, two tools are used 

set back to back, and the one 

that is not cutting is relieved 

for the time being, that is 

tilted to clear the work. 

Neither of these tools will 

plane up to a shoulder as will 

the ordinary ones. 

Allied Machines. — The re- 
ciprocation of the tool or the 

work, generally the former, is 

adopted in several machines 

besides the standard types 

named. The plate-edge planer 

is used by platers and boiler 

makers. It is a side planer, 

the plates being bolted to a 

bed, and the tool traversing 

and cutting on one or both 

strokes. Provision is often 

included for planing edges at 

right angles. The key-seaters 

are a special type, designed 

mainly to remove the work of cutting key grooves in the bores 

of wheels and pulleys from the slotting machine. The work is 

fixed on a table and the keyway cutting tool is drawn downwards 

through the bore, with several resulting practical advantages. 

Many planing machines are portable so that they may be fixed 

upon very massive work. Several gear-wheel cutting machines 

embody the reciprocating tool. 

III. — Drilling and Boring Machines 
The strict distinction between the operations of drilling and 
boring is that the first initiates a hole, while the second enlarges one 
already existing. But the terms are used with some latitude. A 
combined drilling and boring machine is one which has provision 
for both functions. But when holes are of large dimensions the 
drilling machine is useless because the proportions and gears are 
unsuitable. A 6-in. drill is unusually large, but holes are bored up 
to 30 ft. or more in diameter. 

Types of Machines,— The distinction between machines with 

vertical and horizontal spindles is not vital, but of convenience only. 

v? P nnci P a l controlling element in design is the mass of the work, 

which often determines whether it or the machine shall be adjusted 

relatively to each other. Also the dimensions of a hole determine 



the speed of the tools, and this controls the design of the driving 
and feeding mechanism. Another important difference is that 
between drilling or boring one or more holes simultaneously. With 
few exceptions the tool rotates and the work is stationary. The 
notable exceptions are the vertical boring lathes already mentioned. 
Obviously the demands made upon drilling machines are nearly as 
varied as those on lathes. There is little in common between the 
machines which are serviceable for the odd jobs done in the general 
shop and those which are required for the repetitive work of the 
shops which handle specialities. Provision often has to be made 
for drilling simultaneously several^ holes at certain centres or 
holes at various angles* or to definite depths, while the mass of 
the spindles of the heavier machines renders counter-balancing 
essential. 

Bench Machines are the simplest and smallest of the group. They 
are operated either by hand or by power. In the power machines 
generally, except in the smallest, the drill is also fed downwards 
by power, by means of toothed gears. The upper part of the drilling

spindle being threaded is turned by an encircling spur-wheel, operated 
very slowly by a pinion and hand-wheel by the right hand of the 
attendant, the movement being made independent of the rotation 
of the spindle. A rack sleeve encircling the spindle is also common. 
In the power machines gears are also used, but a belt on small cone 
pulleys drives from the main cone shaft at variable speeds. From 
three to four drilling and feeding speeds are provided for by the 
respective cone pulleys. Work is held on or bolted to a circular 
table, which may have provision for vertical adjustment to suit 
pieces of work of different depths, and which can usually be swung 
aside out of the way to permit of deep pieces of work being introduced, 
resting on the floor or on blocking. 

Wall Machines. — One group of these machines resembles the bench 
machines in general design, but they are made to bolt to a wall 
^ j r °f on a bench. Their value lies in the facilities which they 
afford for drilling large pieces of work lying on the floor on block- 
ing, which could not go on the tables of the bench machines. Some- 
times a compound work-table is fastened to the floor beneath; 
and several machines also are ranged in line, by means of which long 
plates, angles, boilers or castings may be brought under the simul- 
taneous action of the group of machines. Another type is the 
radial arm machine, with or without a table beneath. In each case

an advantage gained is that a supporting pillar or standard is not 
required, its place being taken by the wall. 

Self-contained Pillar Machines include a large number having the 
above-named feature in common. In the older and less valuable 
types the framework is rigid, and the driving and feeding are by belt 
cones. But the machines being mostly of larger capacities than those 
just noted, back-gears similar to those of lathes are generally in- 
troduced. The spindles also are usually counterbalanced. The 
machine framing is bolted to a bed-plate. A circular work-table 
may or may not be included. When it is, provision is made for 
elevating the table by gears, and also for swinging it aside when deep 
work has to be put on the base-plate. 

Radial Arm Machines. — In these (fig. 46) the drilling mechanism 
is carried on a radial arm which is pivoted to the pillar with the 
object of moving the drill over the work, when the latter is too massive 
to permit of convenient adjustment under the drill. The driving 
takes place through shafts at right angles, from a horizontal shaft 
carrying the cones and back-geared to a vertical one, thence to a 
horizontal one along the radial arm, whence the vertical drilling 



makers and platers. In others the spindles are adjustable in circles 
of varying radii, as in those employed for drilling the bolt holes in 
pipe flanges. In^many of these the spindles are horizontal. Some 
very special multiple-spindle machines have the spindles at different 
angles, horizontal and vertical, or at angles. 

Universal Machines are a particular form of the pillar type in 
which the spindle is horizontal, moving with its carriage on a pillar 
capable of traversing horizontally along a bed; the carriage has ver- 
tical adjustment on its pillar and so commands the whole of the face 
of a large piece of work bolted to alow bed-plate adjacent to the 
machine. The term "universal " signifies that the machine com- 
bines provision for drilling, boring, tapping screws and inserting 
screw studs, facing and in some cases milling. The power required 
for boring is obtained by double and treble gears. These machines 
are used largely in marine engine works, where very massive 
castings and forgings must be operated on with their faces set 
vertically. 

Boring Machines. — Many^ machines are classified as suitable for 
drilling and boring. That simply means that provision is made on

spindle is driven. The latter has its bearings in a carriage which 
can be traversed along the arm for adjustment of radius. The 
spindle is counterbalanced. Hand as well as power adjustments 
are included. In the work-tables of radial and rigid machines 
there is a great diversity, so that work can be set on top, or at the 
sides, or at an angle, or on compound tables, so covering all the 
requirements of practice. 

Sensitive Machines have developed greatly and have superseded 
many of the older, slower designs. The occasion for their use lies 
in the drilling of small holes, ranging up to about an inch in diameter. 
They are belt-driven, without back-gears, and usually without 
bevel-gears to change the direction of motion. The feed is by lever 
moving a rack sleeve. A slender pillar with a foot supports the 
entire mechanism, and the work-table, with a range of vertical 
adjustment. 

Multiple Spindle Machines. — Many of the sensitive machines 
are fitted with two, three or more spindles operated in unison with 
a belt common to all. In other machines the multiple spindles are 
capable of adjustment for centres, as in the machines used by boiler

a drilling machine for boring holes of moderate size, say up to 8 or 
10 in., by double and treble back-gears. But the real boring machine 
is of a different type. In the horizontal machines a splined bar 
actuated by suitable gears carries a boring head which holds the 
cutters, which head is both rotated with, and traversed or fed along 
the bar. The work to be bored is fixed on a table which has pro- 
vision for vertical adjustment to suit work of different dimensions. 
The boring-bar is supported at both ends. In the case of the 
largest work the boring-bar is preferably set with its axis vertically, 
and the framing of the machine is arch-like. The bar is carried in 
a bearing at the crown of the arch and driven and fed there by suit- 
able gears, while the other end of the bar rotates in the table which 
forms the base of the machine. Some boring machines for small 
engine cylinders and pump barrels have no bar proper, but a long 
boring spindle carrying cutters at the further end is supported along 
its entire length in a long stiff boss projecting from the headstock 
of the machine — the snout machine. The work is bolted on a carriage 
which slides along a bed similar to a lathe bed. Many of these 
machines have two bars for boring two cylinders simultaneously-

[MILLING MACHINES 



IV. — Milling Machines 

In milling machines rotary saw-like cutters are employed. To a 
certain extent these and some gear-cutting machines overlap because 
they have points in common. Many gear-wheel teeth are produced 
by rotary cutters on milling machines. In many machines designed 
for gear cutting only, rotary cutters alone are used. For this reason 
the two classes of machines are conveniently and naturally grouped 
together, notwithstanding that a large and increasing group of gear- 
cutting machines operate with reciprocating tools. 

The French engineer, Jacques de Vaucanson (i 709-1782), is 
credited with having made the first milling cutter. The first very 
crude milling machine was made in 1818 at a gun factory in Connecti- 
cut. To-day the practice of milling ranks as of equal economic value 
with that of any other department of the machine shop, and the 
varieties of milling machines made are as highly differentiated as are 
those of any other group. An apparent incongruity which is rather 
striking is the relative disproportion between the mass of these 
machines and the small dimensions of the cutters. The failures of 
many of the early machines were largely due to alack of appreciation 
of the intensity of the stresses involved in milling. Asingle-edged 
cutting tool has generally a very narrow edge in operation. Milling 
cutters are as a rule yery wide by comparison, and several teeth in 
deep cuts are often in simultaneous operation. The result is that 
the machine spindle and the arbor or tool mandrel are subjected to 
severe stress, the cutter tends to spring away from the surface being 
cut, and if the framings are of light proportions they vibrate, and in- 
accuracy and chatter result. Even with the very stiff machines now 
made it is not possible to produce such accurate results on wide sur- 
faces as with the planer using a narrow-edged tool. Because 
of this great resistance and stress, cutters of over about 
an inch in width are always made with the teeth arranged 
spirally, and wide cutters which are intended for roughing 
down to compete with the planer always have either 
inserted cutters or staggered teeth. Hence the rotary cutter 
type of machine has not been able to displace the planing 
machine in wide work when great accuracy is essential. Its place 
lies in other spheres, in some of which its position is unassailable. 
Nearly all pieces of small and medium dimensions are machined as 
well by milling as by single-edged tools. AH pieces which have more 
than one face to be operated on are done better in the milling machine 
than elsewhere. All pieces which have profiled outlines involving 
combinations of curves and plane faces can generally only be pro- 
duced economically^ by^ milling.^ Nearly all work that involves 
equal divisions, or pitchings, as in the manufacture of the cutters 
themselves, or spiral cutting, or the teeth of gear-wheels when pro- 
duced by rotary cutters, must be done in milling machines. Beyond 
these a large quantity of work lies on the border-line, where the cnoice 
between milling and planing, shaping, slotting, &c, is a matter for 
individual judgment and experience. It is a matter for some sur- 
prise that round the little milling cutter so many designs of machines 
nave been built, varying from each other in the position of the tool 
spindles, in their number, and in the means adopted for actuating 
them and the tables which carry the work. 

A very early type of milling machine, which remains extremely 
popular, was the Lincoln. It was designed, as were all the early 
machines, for the small arms factories in the United States. The 
necessity for all the similar parts of pistols and rifles being inter- 
changeable^ has had the paramount influence in the development 
of the milling machine. In the Lincoln machine as now made 
(fig. 47) the work is attached to a table, or to a vice on the table, 
which has horizontal and cross traverse movements on a bed, but 
no capacity for vertical adjustment. The cutter is held and rotated 
on an arbor driven from a headstock pulley, and supported on a tail- 
stock centre at the other end, with capacity for a good range of ver- 
tical adjustment. This is necessary both to admit pieces of work 
of different depths or thicknesses between the table and the cutter, 
and to regulate the depth of cutting (vertical feed). Around this 
general design numerous machines small and large, with many 
variations in detail, are built. But the essential feature is the ver- 
tical movement of the spindle and cutter, the support of the arbor 
(cutter spindle) at both ends, and the rigidity afforded by the bed 
which supports head- and tail-stock and table. 

The pillar and knee machines form another group which divides 
favour about equally with the Lincoln, the design being nearly of 
an opposite character. The vertical movements for setting and 
feed are imparted to the work, which in this case is carried on a 
bracket or knee that slides on the face of the pillar which supports 
the headstock. Travelling and transverse movements are imparted 
to the table slides. The cutter arbor may or may not be supported 
away from the headstock by an arched overhanging arm. None of 
these machines is of large dimensions. They are made in two leading 
designs — the plain and the universal. The first embodies rectangular 
relations only, the second is a marvellous instrument both in 
its range of movements and fine degree of precision. The first 
machine of this kind was exhibited at Paris in 1867. The design 
permits the cutting of spiral grooves, the angle of which is embodied 
in the adjustment of a swivelling table and of a headstock thereon 
(universal or spiral head). The latter embodies change-gears like 



a screw-cutting lathe and worm-gear for turning the head, in com- 
bination with an index or dividing plate having several circles of 
holes, which by the insertion of an index peg permit of the work 
spindle being locked during a cut. The combinations possible with 
the division plate and worm-gear number hundreds. The head also 
has angular adjustments in the vertical direction, so that tapered 
work can be done as well as parallel. The result is that there Is 
nothing in the range of spiral or parallel milling, or tapered work or 
spur or bevel-gear cutting, or cutter making, that cannot be done 
on this type of machine, and the accuracy of the results of equal 
divisions of pitch and angle of spiral do not depend on the human 
element, but are embodied in the mechanism.

Machines with vertical spindles (fig. 48) form another great group, 
the general construction of which resembles that either of the com- 
mon drilling machine or of the slotting machine. In many cases the 
horizontal position is preferable for tooling, in others the vertical, 
but often tne matter is indifferent. For general purposes, the heavier 
class of work excepted, the vertical is more convenient. But apart 
from the fitting of a special brace to the lower end of the spindle 
which carries the cutter, the spindle is unsupported there and is 
thus liable to spring. But a brace can only be used with a milling 
cutter that operates by its edges, while one advantage of the vertical 
spindle machine is that it permits of the use of end or face cutters. 
One of the greatest advantages incidental to the vertical position 
of the spindle is that it permits of profile milling being done. One 
of the most tedious operations in the machine shop is the production 
of outlines which are not those of the regular geometric figures, 
as rectangles and circles, or combinations of the same. There is 



GEAR-CUTTING MACHINES] 



TOOL 



33 



only one way in which irregular forms can be produced cheaply 
and interchangeably, and that is by controlling the movements of 
the tool with an object of similar shape termed a "form "or 
41 former/' as in the well-known copying lathes, in the cam grinding 
machine, and in the forming adjuncts fitted to vertical spindle milling 
machines, so converting those into profiling machines. The prin- 
ciple and its application are alike simple. An object (the form) is 
made in hardened steel, having the same outlines as the object to be 
milled, and the slide which carries the cutter spindle has a hardened 
former pin or roller, which is pulled hard against the edges of 
the form by a suspended weight, so causing the tool to move and cut 
in the same path and in the same plane around the edges of the work. 
Here the milling machine holds a paramount place. No matter 
how many curves and straight portions may be combined in a piece, 
the machine reproduces them all faultlessly, and a hundred or a 
thousand others all precisely alike without any tentative corrections. 
Piano-millers, also termed slabbing machines, form a group that 
grows in value and in maps and capacity. They are a comparatively 
late development, becoming the chief rivals to the planing machines, 
for all the early milling was of a very light character. In general 
outlines the piano-millers closely resemble the planing machines, 
having bed, table, housings and cross-rail. The latter in the piano- 
miller carries the bearings for the cutter spindle or spindles under 
which the work travels and reciprocates. These spindles are ver- 
tical, but in some machines horizontal ones are fitted also, as in 
planers, so that three faces at right or other angles can be operated 
on simultaneously. The slabbing operations of the piano-millers do 
not indicate the full or even the principal utilities of these machines. 
To understand these it must be remembered that the cross-sections 
of very many parts which have to be tooled do not lie in single planes 
merely, but in combinations of plane surfaces, horizontal, vertical 
or angular. In working these on the planing machine separate 
settings of tools are required, and often successive settings. But 
milling cutters are built up in " gangs " to deal with such cases, and 
in this way the entire width of profile is milled at once. Horizontal 
faces, and vertical and angular edges and grooves, are tooled simul- 
taneously, with much economy in time, and the cutter profile will 
be accurately reproduced on numbers of separate pieces. ^ Allied 
to the piano-millers are the rotary planers. .They derive their name 
from the design of the cutters. An iron disk is pierced with holes 
for the insertion of a large number of separate cutters, which by the 
rotation of the disk produce plane surfaces. These are milling 
cutters, though the tools are single-edged ones, hence termed 
11 inserted tooth mills." These are used on other machines besides 
the rotary planers, but the latter are massive machines built on 
the planer model, with but one housing or upright to carry the 
carriage of the cutter swindle. These machines, varied considerably 
in design, do good service on a class of work in which a very high 
degree of accuracy is not essential, as column flanges, ends of 
girders, feet of castings, and such like. 

V. — Gear-cutting Machines 

The practice of cutting the teeth of gear-wheels has grown but 
slowly. In the gears used by engineers, thoseof large dimensions 
are numerous, and the cost of cutting these is often prohibitive, 
though it is unnecessary in numbers of mechanisms for which 
cast wheels are as suitable as the more accurately cut ones. The 
smallest gears for machines of precision^ have long been produced 
by cutting, but of late years the practice has been extending to 
include those of medium and large dimensions, a movement which 
has been largely favoured by the growth of electric driving, the 
high speeds of which make great demands on reduction and trans- 
mission gears. Several new types of gear-cutting machines have 
been designed, and specialization is still growing, until the older 
machines, which would, after a fashion, cut all forms of gears, 
are being ousted from modern establishments. 

The teeth of gear-wheels are produced either by rotary milling 
cutters or by single-edged tools (fig, 49). The advantage of the 
first is that the cutter used has the same sectional form as the inter- 
tooth space, so that the act of tooth cutting imparts the shapes 
without assistance from externa! mechanism. But this holds good 
only in regard to spur-wheel teeth, that is, those in which the teeth 
lie parallel with the axis of the wheel. The teeth of bevel-wheels, 
though often produced by rotary cutters, can never be formed 
absolutely correctly, simply because a cutter of unalterable section 
is employed to form the shapes which are constantly changing 
in dimensions along the length of the teeth (the bevel-wheel being 
a frustum of a cone). Hence, though fair working teeth are ob- 
tained in this way, they result from the practice of varying the 
relative angles of the cutters and wheel and removing the material 
in several successive operations or traverses, often followed by a 
little correction with the file. Although this practice is still commonly 
followed in bevel-wheels of small dimensions, and was at one time 
the only method available, the practice has been changing in favour 
of shaping the teeth by a process of planing with a single-edged 
reciprocating tool. As, however, such a tool embodies no formative 
section as do the milling cutters, either it or the wheel blank, or 
both, have to be coerced and controlled by mechanism outside the 
tool itself. Around this method a number of very ingenious 

xxvxr. 2 



machines have been designed, which may be broadly classed under 
two great groups — the form and the generating types. 

In the form machines a pattern tooth or form-tooth is prepared 
in hardened steel, usually three times as large as the actual teeth 
to be cut, and the movement of the mechanism which carries the 
wheel blank is coerced by this form, so that the tool, reciprocated 
by its bar, produces the same shape on the reduced dimensions of 
the wheel^ teeth. The generating machines use no pattern tooth, 
but the principles of the tooth formation are embodied in the mechan- 
ism itself. These are very interesting designs, because they not 
only shape the teeth without a pattern tooth, but their movements 
are automatically controlled. A large number of these have been 
brought out in recent years, their growth being due to the demand 
for accurate gears for motor cars, for electric driving, and for 
general high-class engineers' work. These are so specialized that 
they can only cut the one class of gear for which they are designed — 
the bevel-wheels, and these in only a moderate range of dimensions 
on a single machine of a given size. The principal bevel-gear 
cutting machines using forms or formers, are the Greenwood & 
Batley, Le Progres Industriel, the Bouncy (cuts helical teeth), 
the Oerlikon, which includes two types, the single and double 
cutting tools, the Gleason and the Rice. Generating machines 
include the Bilgram (the oldest), the Robey-Smith, the Monneret, 
the Warren, the Beale and the Dubosc.

As the difficulties of cutting bevel-wheels with rotary cutters, 
consequent on change of section of the teeth, do not occur in spur- 
gears, there are no examples of form machines for spur-wheel 
cutting, and only one generating planing type of machine, the 
Fellows, which produces involute teeth by a hardened steel-cutting 
pinion, which shapes wheels having any number of teeth of the 
same pitch, the cutter and blank being partly rotated between each 
cut as they roll when in engagement. 

The worm-gears appropriate a different group of machines, the 
demands on which have become more exacting since the growth 
of electric driving has brought these gears into a position of greater 
importance than they ever occupied before. With this growth 
the demand for nothing less than perfect gears has developed. 
A perfect gear is one in which the teeth of the worm-wheel are 
envelopes of the worm or screw, and this form can only be produced 
in practice in one way — by using a cutter^ that is practically a 
serrated worm (a hob), which cuts its way into the wheel just as 
an actual worm might be supposed to mould the teeth of a wheel 
made of a plastic substance. To accomplish this the relative move- 
ments of the hob and the wheel blank are arranged to be precisely 
those of the working worm and wheel. Very few such machines 
are made. A practical compromise is effected by causing the hob 



34 



TOOL 



[GRINDING MACHINES 



both to drive and cut the blank in an ordinary machine. When 
worms are not produced by these methods the envelope cannot be 
obtained, but each tooth space is cut by an involute milling cutter 
set at the angle of thread in a universal machine, or else in one of 
the general gear-cutting machines used for spur, bevel and worm 
gears, and only capable of yielding really accurate results in the 
case of spur-wheels. 

The previous remarks relate only to the sectional forms of the 
teeth. But their pitch or < distance from centre to centre requires 
dividing mechanism. This includes a main dividing or worm- 
wheel, a worm in conjunction with change gears, and a division 
plate for setting and locking the mechanism. The plate may have 
four divisions only to receive the locking lever or it may be drilled 
with a large number of holes in circles for an index peg. The 
first is adopted in the regular gear-cutters, the second on the 
universal milling machines which are used also for gear-cutting. 
In the largest number of machines this pitching has to be done by 
an attendant as often as one tooth is completed. But in a good 
number of recent machines the pitching is effected by the move- 
ments of the machine itself without human intervention. With 
spur-wheels the cutting proceeds until the wheel is complete, when 
the machine is often made to ring a bell to call attention to the 
fact. But in bevel -wheels only one side of the teeth all the way 
round can be done; the attendant must then effect the necessary 
settings for the other side, after which the pitchings are automatic. 

As a general rule only one tooth is being operated on at one time. 
But economy is studied in spur-gears by setting several similar 
wheels in line on a mandrel and cutting through a single tooth 
of the series at one traverse pi the tool. In toothed racks the 
same device is adopted. Again, there are cases in which cutters 
are made to operate simultaneously on two, three or more adjacent 
teeth. 

Recently a generating machine of novel design has been manu- 
factured, the spur-wheel hobbing machine. In appearance the 
hob resembles that employed for cutting worm-gears, but it also 
generates the teeth of spur and spiral gears. The hob is a worm 
cut to form teeth, backed off and hardened. The section of the 
worm thread is that of a rack. Though it will cut worm-wheels, 
spiral-wheels or spur-wheels equally correctly, the method of pre- 
sentation varies. When cutting worm-wheels it is fed inwards per- 
pendicularly to the blank; when cutting spirals it is set at a suitable 
angle and fed across the face of the blank. The angle of the worm 
thread in the hob being about 2J , it has to be set by that amount 
out of parallel with the plane of the gear to be cut. It is then fed 
down the face of the wheel blank, which is rotated so as to syn- 
chronize with the rotation of the worm. This is effected through 
change gears, which are altered for wheels having different numbers 
of teeth. The advantage is that of the hob over single cutters; 
one hob serves for all wheels^ of the same pitch, and each wheel 
is cut absolutely correct. While using a set of single cutters many 
wheels must have their teeth only approximately correct. 

VI. — Grinding Machines 

The practice of finishing metallic surfaces by grinding, though 
very old, is nevertheless with regard to its rivalry with the work 
of the ordinary machine tools a development of the last part of the 
19th century. From being a non-precision method, grinding has 
become the most perfect device for producing accurate results 
measured precisely within thousandths of an inch. K would be 
rather difficult to mention any class of machine-shop work which 
is not now done by the grinding wheel. The most recent develop- 
ments are grinding out engine cylinders and grinding the lips of 
twist drills by automatic movements, the drills rotating constantly. 

There are five very broad divisions under which grinding machines 
may be classified, but the individual, well-defined groups or types 
might number a hundred. The main divisions are: (1) Machines 
for dealing with plane surfaces; (2) machines for plain cylindrical 
work, external and internal; (3) the universals, which embody 
movements rendering them capable of angular setting; (4) the 
topi grinders: and (5) the specialized machines. Most of these 
mighty be again classed under two heads, the non-precision and the 
precision types. The difference between these two classes is that 
the first does not embody provision for measuring the amount of 
material removed, while the second does. This distinction is a 
most important one. 

The underlying resemblances and the differences in the main 
designs of the groups of machines just now noted will be better 
understood if the essential conditions of grinding as a correc- 
tive process are grasped. The cardinal point is that accurate 
results are produced by wheels that are themselves being abraded 
constantly. That is not the case in steel cutting tools, or at least 
in but an infinitesimal degree. A steel tool will retain its edge for 
several hours (often for days) without the need for regrinding, 
but the particles of abrasive in an emery or other grinding wheel 
are being incessantly torn out and removed. A wheel in traversing 
along a shaft say of 3 ft. in length is smaller in diameter at the 
terrmnation than at the beginning of the traverse, and therefore 
the shaft must be theoretically larger at one end than the other, 
bhafts, nevertheless, are ground parallel. The explanation is, and 



it lies at the basis of emery grinding, that the feed or amount 
removed at a single traverse isextremely minute, say a thousandth 
or half a thousandth of an inch.^ The minuteness of the feed 
receives compensation in the repetition and rapidity of the traverse. 
The wear of the wheel is reduced to a minimum and true work 
is produced. 

From this fact of the wear of grinding wheels two important 
results follow. One is that a traverse or lateral movement must 
always take place between the wheel and the piece of work being 
ground. This is necessary in order to preventa mutual grooving 
action between the wheel and work. The other is that it is essential 
to provide a large range in quality of wheels, graded according to 
coarseness and fineness, of hardness and softness of emery to suit 
all the different metals and alloys. Actually about sixty grades 
are manufactured, but about a dozen will generally cover average 
shop practice. With such a choice of wheels the soltest brass as 
well as the hardest tempered steel or case-hardened glass-like 
surfaces that could not possibly be cut in lathe or planer, can be 
ground with extreme accuracy.

Plane surfacing machines in many cases resemble in general 
outlines the well-known planing machine and the vertical boring 
milL The wheels traverse across the work, and they are fed 
vertically to precise fractional dimensions. They fill a large place 
in finishing plane surfaces, broad and narrow alike, and have be- 
come rivals to the planing and milling machines doing a similar 
class of work. For hardened surfaces they have no rival. 

Cylindrical _ grinders include many subdivisions to embrace 
external and internal surfaces, either parallel or tapered, small or

large. In their highest development they fulfil what are termed 
4t universal M functions (fig. 5o),that is, they are capable of grinding 
both external and internal cylinders, plane faces, tapers, both of 
low and high angle, and the teeth of various kinds of tools and 
cutters. These machines occur in two broad types. In one the 
axis of the revolving wheel is traversed pastPthe work, which 
revolves but is not traversed. In the other the reverse occurs, 
the work traversing and the axis of the wheel with its bearings 
remaining stationary. Equally satisfactory results are obtained 
by each. 

In all external cylindrical grinding, when the work can be rotated, 
the piece being ground rotates in an opposite direction to the 
rotation of the wheel (fig. 51, A). In all small pieces ground 
internally the same procedure is adopted (fig. 51, B). Incidentally,

A, External cylindrical grinding. 5, Internal ditto. C, External 

grinding when the work is fixed. D, Internal ditto. 

mention should be made of the fineness of the fitting required and 
attained in the construction of the spindles which carry the wheels 
for internal grinding. The perfection of fitting and of the means 
of adjustment for eliminating the effects of wear in the ordinary 
spindles for external and internal grinding is remarkable. The 
spindles for internal work have to revolve at rates ranging from about 
6000 to 30,000 times in a minute, yet run so truly that the holes 
ground do not depart from accuracy by more than say ^ta to -nri.inr 
of an inch. Yet so long as the work can be revolved no special 
complication of mechanism is required to ensure good results. 
The revolution of the wheel and the work is mutually helpful. The 
real difficulties arise when the work, on account of jtsmass or awk- 
wardness of shape, cannot be revolved. The principle embodied 
in machines designed to deal satisfactorily with such cases, though 
much diversified in detail, is the application of the planet device^ to 
the grinding wheels. That is, the wheel spindle rotating at a high 
speed, 6000 or 7000 revolutions per minute, ^ is simultaneously 
carried round in a circular path, so that its axis makes about 25 
or 30 revolutions per minute (fig. 51, C and D). The diameter of 
the path is capable of adjustment with minute precision within 
wide limits to suit bores of different diameters. The periphery^ of 
the grinding wheel which lies farthest fromits axis of revolution 
sweeps round in a path* the diameter of which equals that of the 
bore to be ground. These machines are now used largely^ for 
grinding out the cylinders of gas and petrol engines, valve seatings, 
the bushed holes of coupling rods, and similar classes of work. 
Many of them have their spindles set horizontally, others vertically. 

Allied to these are a relatively small but important group of 
machines used for grinding the slot links of the slide-valve gear 
of locomotive and other engines. The slot is mounted on a pivoted 
bar adjusted to the same radius as the slot to be ground, and the 
slot is moved relatively to the wheel, so producing the required 
curves. 

In another direction much development has taken place jn the 
practice of grinding. The increasing use of the milling cutter has

edges of milling cutter; a, a, Tooth rests. C, Grinding face of

been the occasion for the growth and high specialization of the cutter 
grinding machines. It is essential to the efficiency of such cutters 
that regrinding shall be done without drawing the temper, and this 
can only be effected by the use of an abrasive. In the early days 
of their use the temper hadto be drawn to permit of filing and 
rehardening effected with its inevitable distortion. 

Cutter grinding machines must possess universality of movements 
to deal with the numerous shapes in which milling cutters are made; 
heneethey often resemble in general outlines the universal grinding 
machines. But as a rule they are built on lighter models, and with 
a smaller range of movements, because the dimensions of cutters are 



generally much smaller than those of the ordinary run of engineers' 
work which has to be ground. Frequently a single pillar or standard 
suffices to carry the mechanism. In an ordinary universal tool 
grinder all the teeth of any form of cutter can be ground pre^sely 
alike (fig. 52)^ excepting those having irregular profiled outlines, for 
which a special machine, or an extra attachment to an ordinary 
machine, is necessary. But little of this is done, because in such 
eases, and in many others, the faces of the teeth are ground instead 
of the ed^e. This idea, due to the firm of Brown & Sharpe, may 
seem a trifle, but nevertheless to it the credit is largely due for the 
economies of cutter grinding. The principle is that in the " formed 
cutter/' as it is termed, the profiles of the teeth are not struck from 
the axis of revolution, but from another centre (fig. 20); grinding 
the tooth faces, therefore, has no effect on the shapes of the profiles, 
but only lessens the tooth thicknesses. Designed originally for 
the cutters for the teeth of gear-wheels, it has long been applied 
to profiles which involve combinations of curves. The pitching 
of the teeth is effected by a strip of metal, or tooth rest a (fig. 52), 
on which each successive tooth rests and is coerced during the 
grinding. If teeth are of special form the traverse movement of 
a spiral tooth along the rest ensures the required movement. 

Besides the cutter grinders used for milling cutters, reamers and 
screwing taps, there are two other groups of tool grinders, one for 
twist drills o^Jy and the other for the single-edged tools used in 
lathe, planer, shaper and other machines. Both these in their best 
forms are of recent development. The machines used for grinding 
twist drills embody numerous designs. Hand grinding is practically 
abandoned, the reason being that a very minute departure from 
symmetry on the two cutting lips of the drill results inevitably in 
the production of inaccurate holes. It is essential that the two 
lips be alike in regard to length, angle and clearance, and these are 
embodied in the mechanism of the grinding machines. But formerly 
in all these the drill holder had to be moved by hand around its 

Eivot^ and one^ lip ground at a time There are now some very 
eautiful machines of German manufacture in which the necessary 
movements are all automatic, derived from the continuous rotation 
of a belt pulley. The drill rotates constantly, and small amounts 
are ground off each lip in turn until the grinding is finished. The 
other group for grinding single-edged tools is a very small one. 
The correct angles for grinding are embodied in the setting of the 
machine, with the great advantage that any number of similar tools 
can be ground all alike without skilled attendance. 

Lying outside these broad types of machines there is a large and 
growing number designed for special service. The knife-grinding 
group for sharpening the planer knives used in wood-working 
machinery is a^ large one. Another is that for gulleting or deepening 
the teeth of circular saws as they wear. Another is designed for 
grinding the cups and cones for the ball races of cycle wheels, and 
another for grinding the hardened steel balls employed in ball 
bearings.

Emery grinding is dependent for much of its success on a plentiful 
supply of water. Dry grinding, which was the original practice, 
is hardly employed now. The early difficulties^ wet grinding were 
due to the want of a cementing material which would not soften 
under the action of water. Now wheels will run constantly without 
damage by water, and they are so porous that water will filter through 
them. Improvements in the manufacture of wheels, and the 
increased use of water, have concurred to render possible heavier 
and more rapid grinding without risk of distortion due to heating 
effects. In the best modern machines the provisions for water 
supply are a study in themselves, including a centrifugal pump, a 
tank, jointed piping, spraying tube, guards to protect the bearings 
and slides from damage, and trays to receive the waste water and 
conduct it back to the tank. 

There are two points of view from which the modern practice 
of grinding is now regarded — one as a corrective, the other as a 



3& 



TOOL 



[SAWING MACHINES 




formative process. The first is the older and is still by far the most 
important. The second is a later ideal towards which design and 
practice have been extending. As yet 
grinding cannot compete with the work 
of the single-edged tools and milling cut- 
ters when large quantities of material 
have to be removed. Just as some 

D leading firms have been designing 

stiffer machines having fuller lubri- 
"k^^ftsS ~t~t cation with a view to increase the duty 

of grinding wheels, the advent of the 
high-speed steels has given a new lease 
of lifeto the single-edged cutting tools. 
The rivalry now lies not with the tools 
of carbon temper steel, but with high- 
speed varieties. But as a corrective 
process grinding^ never occupied so im- 
portant a position as it does to-day, 
and its utility continuesto extend. 

The commoner forms in which grind- 
ing wheels are made are shown in fig. 53. 
These are varied largely in dimensions, 
from tiny cylindrical rollers a fraction 
of an inch in diameter for hole grind- 
ing, to big wheels of 3 ft. or more 
in diameter. Safety mountings, two 
examples of which are shown in fig. 54, 
embody means of^ retaining the broken 
pieces of a wheel in case it bursts.

by varying the class of sand and its velocity. 

Other materials, such as emery, chilled iron 

globules, &c, are employed for certain classes 

?j In some ms tances the powder is 

used dry, in others it is mixed with water, 

being then in the condition of fluid mud. The 

plant includes an air-compressing engine, an. 





air reservoir and the blast nozzle through which the air passes and 
propels the sand in the form of a jet. The pressures range from 
8 lb up to about 60 lb per sq. in., depending on the class of work 
which is done. 

The peculiar advantage of the sandblast lies in its adaptability to 
the working of irrfeular surfaces, which could not be touched by any 
other class of grinding. The blast penetrates hollows and recesses, 
and acts over an entire surface. There are many classes of 
operation done with the sand-blast, including cleaning, frosting, 
ornamentation, engraving and sharpening. In engineers' works 
a large amount of cleaning is effected upon castings, forgings, sheets 
and other products, either preparatory to machining or to painting, 
enamelling, tinning, galvanizing or plating. Cycle frames are 
cleaned with the sand-blast after brazing. The teeth of files are 
sharpened by directing a stream of sancT and water against their 
backs, with the result that the burr thrown up by the chisel when 
cutting is obliterated, and a strong form of tooth is produced. Worn 
files may also be sharpened up to equal new ones by sand-blasting 
them. Frosting glass is another useful application of the sand-blast, 
and by attaching suitable patterns or designs to the surface the sand 
may be caused to work ornamental figurings. It is a peculiar circum- 
stance that the sand has little effect upon soft and yielding substances 
in comparison with the abrasion it produces on hard surfaces, so 
that the pattern will remain undamaged, while the glass or other 
object beneath is frosted where the sand reaches it, through the 
openings. Not only can designs be worked on glass, or cut in stone, 
but perforations may be made in glass, &c, by the continued action 
of the sand, without any risk of fracture occurring. Much sand- 
blasting is performed inside closed chambers, having panes through 
which the workman watches the progress of the operation. But 
when the blast must be used in the open, protection is necessary and 
is afforded to the operator by a special helmet, which keeps out the 
flying dust and gives a supply of pure air through a tube in a 
similar fashion to the diver's helmet. 

VII. — Sawing Machines 
Metal-sawing machines are employed extensively in engineering 
works for cutting off bars, shafts, rails, girders and risers on steel 
castings, and for getting out curved pieces which would be difficult 
and expensive to slot. There are three classes of these saws, circular, 
band and reciprocating. The first named are used for straight- 
forward work, operating at 
right or other angles, the 
second for straight cuts and 
also for curves which can- 
not be treated with circular 
saws, and the third for small 
pieces. The circular saws em- 
body a stiff spindle, carrying 
the saw disk and driven by 
gearing. This spindle may 
mounted in a sliding 
bearing to carry it past the 
work held on a fixed table, 
or the spindle may be sta- 
tionary and the work be 
moved along past the saw.

to the teeth, should undue stress come upon the saw. This is usually 
effected by the use of weights or springs, which allow a certain free- 
dom or latitude to the driving gears. The work is held by screw 
clamps, V-blocks being required in the case of circular objects. A 
number of pieces, such as shafts, rails or girders, can be fastened down 
close together in a pile and cut through in one operation. 

There is a very useful class of circular saw, the flush-side (fig. 55), 
tl'at is valuable for cutting close up to a surface. The disk is bolted 
to a flange on the end of the spindle with countersunk bolts, so that 
the face is quite flat. Another class of saw used for dealing with 
girders and bars is carried in bearings^ upon a pivoted arm, which 
is pulled downwards by a weight to give the feed. The work is 
bolted to a table below the saw. Ample lubrication, by oil or soapy 
water, is essential in cutting wrought iron and steel; it is pumped 
on the blade, keeping it cool and washing away the cuttings. 
• Band-saw machines resemble in outline the familiar types employed 
for sawing wood, but they are necessarily stronger and stiffer, and 
the saws run at a much lower speed. t The tables, moreover, differ 
in possessing compound slides for moving the work and in the provi- 
sion of a series of slots on the top table, whereby the object to be sawn 
is secured with bolts and clamps. The tables are moved automatic- 
ally or by hand. The rate 01 cutting must be varied according to 
the thickness of metal. Lubrication is effected by runningthe lower 
saw pulley in a bath of oil or soapy water, which is carried up, so 
keeping the blade cool and " easing " the cut. 

The reciprocating class of saw has until recently been confined to 
small types for workshop use, termed hack saws, which have a 
small blade ranging from 12 to 18 in. long. # This is strained between 
a couple of bearings in a frame which is reciprocated above the work 
clamped in a vice. An arrangement of weights feeds ^ the saw 
downwards. The larger hack saws cut off bars and girders up 
to 12 in. across, and in some there is a provision introduced for giving 
intermittent rotation to the bar, thus presenting fresh faces to 
the saw. The hack saw is of great utility for comparatively light 
work, and, as the smallest blades are cheap enough to be thrown away 
when worn out, there is no trouble and expense connected with their 
sharpening, as in the circular and band saws. An adaptation of the 
reciprocating saw is that of the jig type, which has a small blade 
set vertically and passing up through a table on which the work is 
laid. It is handy for cutting out dies and various curved outlines, 
in the same manner that fret-sawing in wood is done. 

VIII. — Shearing and Punching Machines 

These have much in common as regards their mode of operation. 
They are actuated either by belt and spur gearing, by steam-engine, 
by electric motor, or hydraulically. The first named is only suitable 
where arrangements can be^ made for driving from a line shaft. 
In view of the great convenience of the other methods of driving, 
they are coming into greater use, especially for ship-yards and other 
works where shafting is undesirable or inconvenient. 

For boiler makers' and platers' use the function of punching, and 
shearing are usually combined in one machine, the rams being placed 
at opposite ends and actuated^ from the same^ source of power % The 
last shaft in the train of gearing is set to bring its ends within the 
boxes containing the rams, and eccentrics on the shaft are moved 
within die blocks fitted to the rams, so that as the shaft revolves it 
causes the rams to move up and down and operate the shear blade and

the punch attached to the bottom 
end. -Another class of machines is 
worked by means of massive levers, 
pivoted in the framing, and actuated 
by cams on the driving shaft which 
cause the levers to rock and move 
the punches or shears up and down 
by the opposite ends. The punch 
slides are constructed to " dwell " 
for a short period at the top of the 
stroke at each revolution, thus giving 
the attendant time to place and ad- 
just the plate accurately beneath the 
punch. The same effect is obtained 
in the eccentric types of machines 
mentioned above, by a disengaging 
motion,which is thrown in by touching 
a lever, thus stopping the punch until 
the operator is ready for its descent. 
The more complete machines have an 
angle shear situated centrally, with 
V-blades for severing angle iron. The 
largest forms of shears, for massive 
plates, usually have the blade recipro- 
cated by crank or eccentrics on the 
driving shaft, coupled by connecting- 
rods to the slide. 

Hydraulic punching and shearing 
machines are used largely on account 
of their convenience, since they dis- 
pense with all belts, engines or motors 
in the vicinity,andgivea very powerful

stroke. The hydraulic cylinder is generally direct-connected to 
the slides, and the operator turns on the pressure water by a lever. 
The machine shown in fig. 56 is a very complete example of the 
hydraulic type, combining punching and shearing with angle-cutting. 
Circular shears are used for the thinner plates and for sheet-metal 
work; they embody two circular blades placed with their axes 
parallel, and the sharp bevelled edges nearly in contact. The blades 
being rotated sever the plate as it is fed between them. Either 
straight or circular cuts may be made; true circles or disks are pro- 
duced by mounting the plate on a fixed stud and rotating it through 
a complete revolution past the cutters. 

IX. — Hammers and Presses 
The growth in the use of hammers actuated by steam and com- 
pressed air, and of presses worked by water power, has been remark- 
able. The precursors of the power hammers were the helve and 
the Oliver; the first named was operated by gravity, being lifted 
by a circle of cams, while the second was lifted by a spring pole 
overhead and pulled down by the foot of the workman, acting on 
a i ever — the hammer shaft. The first was used by the ironworkers 
and the second by the smiths, until displaced by the Nasmyth hammer 
and its extensive progeny. Even now the old helve and Oliver 
survive in some unprogressive shops. 

Steam Hammers. — The original hammer as invented by James 
Nasmyth was single acting, operating simply by gravity, the function 
of the steam being to lift the hammer for each succeeding fall. The 
first improvement was made by Rigby, who took the waste steam 
exhausted from the lower side of the piston to the upper side and 
so imparted some slight pressure in the descent. It was a stage 
between the early and the present hammers. In these, high-pressure 
steam is admitted above the piston to impart a more powerful blow, 
compounded of velocity X mass, than is obtainable by gravity; 
hence they are termed double-acting hammers (fig. 57). The 
principal difficulties which have to be surmounted in their construc- 
tion are those due to the severe concussion of the blows, which 
very sensibly shake the ground over an area of many yards. Fram- 
ings are made very rigid, and in the larger hammers double, enclosing 
the hammer head between them. The foundations are by far the 
heaviest used in any machine tools. Deep piling is often resorted 
to, supporting crossing timber balks; or concrete is laid in mass on 
which the iron anvil block is bedded. This block weighs anywhere 
between 100 and 1000 tons. The piston and its rod and the 
hammer head are generally a solid steel forging, for the piston rod 
is a weak element and cottered or screwed fittings are not trust- 
worthy. Piston valves are gener- 
ally used in preference to ordinary 
D-valves, combining simplicity 
of fitting with good balance. 
The periods of steam admission 
are under the control of the 
attendant, so that the length of 
stroke and the force of the blow 
are instantly responsive to his 
manipulation of the operating 
lever. Many hammers can be 
set to run automatically for any 
given length of stroke. 

Pneumatic Hammers. — A suc- 
cessful type of hammer for the 
ordinary operations of the smithy 
is that which is actuated by com- 
pressed ain Though designs 
vary the principle is the same, 
namely, air compressed in a 
controlling cylinder (fig. 58), and 
brought into an operating or 
hammer cylinder above the piston. 
Cushion ing.or release of the air be- 
low the piston, is under control, as 
is the pressure of the air above it. 
Drop Hammers. — The require- 
ments of forged work have, be- 
. • sides the power hammers ope- 
r'orgmg rated by a positive down stroke, 
been the cause of the develop- 
ment of an equally large group 
which are gravity hammers only 
— the drop hammers. They are 
put into operation by a belt or 
belts, but the function of the 
belt is simply to lift the hammer

But, speaking generally, the largest volume of repetitive die forging 
or stamping o? light articles is done under drop hammers. The 
small arms factories and the regular stamping shops scarcely use 
any other type. They may be roughly divided into three great 
groups; the belt, the board and the latest form— the Brett hfter. 
In each the hammer head or tup is lifted to any height within the 
range of lift, the height being controlled by the attendant at each 
blow. In most machines setting can be done at any constant 
height and the blows delivered automatically. Control is effected 
by hand or foot or both. Drop hammers generally have the 
advantage of working with greater rapidity than steam hammers. 
The original drop hammers, which are believed to have originated 
with the locksmiths of Birmingham and district, consisted of a 
hammer head attached to a rope, one end of which ran up over 
a loose pulley suspended in the roof, and the other was pulled by a 
man or two men, so lifting the hammer, which was then allowed to 
drop. The principle is embodied in many belt hammers to-day, 
but the pulley is driven constantly by shafting, and when the 
attendant pulls at the free end of the belt the friction of the pulley 
draws the belt over and lifts the hammer until the attendant lets 
it go. The weight lifted is greater than in the old type, but the 
labour is nevertheless very severe, and the blows are not rapid 
enough for quick forging. A far better machine is the board hammer. 
In this (fig. 59) the place of the belt is taken by an ordinary strip 
of board which passes between two rollers at the top of the hammer, 
which rollers are belt driven. The rollers are fitted on eccentric

pins, so that the movement of levers causes them to grip the board 
For the lift, or release it for the fall, these levers being under the 
control of the attendant. They can also be set to operate automically 
for any height of lift. 

These types are all subject to much concussion and vibration, 
because the machines are self-contained; anvil, standards and heads 
being rigidly bolted together, the concussion of every blow is trans- 
mitted through the entire mechanism. The Brett hammers (fig.6o) 
are designed to lessen this, in some cases by making the anvil distinct 
from the superstructure, and in all by connecting the lifting ropes 
to the ends of long levers which act something like elastic springs, 
absorbing vibration. The driving mechanism is also original, 
comprising a cylinder with a wing piston, which is* rotated by steam 

f>ressure through an arc of a circle only, sufficiently to operate the 
ifting levers. Another advantage is that the lifter cylinder need 
not be immediately over the hammer, but may be situated elsewhere. 
The hammer can be operated by hand directly for each stroke, or 
be set to work automatically.

Spring Hammers are a rather smaller group than the others. 
In these a belt-driven pulley actuates the tup through the medium 
of elastic leaf springs. The length of stroke is adjustable across 
the face of a slotted disk on the driving shaft. 

Forging Machines. — The Ryder forging machine is fitted with 
four or five pairs of swage tools, the lower halves being fixed and 
the upper ones driven by a rotating eccentric shaft. The operations 
imitate those on the anvil by hand forging, but from 800 to 1200 
blows are delivered in a minute. The swages are arranged in succes- 
sion, so that an operation is begun at one end and finished at the 
other, the attendant moving the bar rapidly through the successive 
swages or dies. 

Forging Presses. — These are rivals to the hammers, especially 
for heavy forcings, from which hammers are being rapidly dis- 
placed (fig. 61). It is now well understood that a hammer will not 



effect the consolidation of a massive forging right to thecentre as a 
press will. The force of the hammer blow is not transmitted to the 
centre as is that of a press, nor is the 
hammer so useful in work of large 
dimensions but of no great weight. 
In railway and wagon shops the 
presses are used far more frequently 
than the hammers. ^ A great advan- 
tage of the press is that two and 
three rams can be brought into 
operation so that a forging may be 
pressed from abpve, from below and 
to one side, which is of great value 
in complicated forms and in welding, 
but is not practicable in the hammers. 
Hence the forging presses have be- 
come developed for work of average 
dimensions as well as for the most 
massive. Many are of horizontal type, 
termed bull-dozers. 

Power presses for working sheet- 
metal articles include those for cut- 
ting out the blanks, termed cutting- 
out or blanking presses, and those 
for cupping or drawing the flat blank 
into shape if desired (fig. 62). The 
lower dies are held upon a bed, and 

the upper in a sliding ram, moved Fig. 61. — Hydraulic Forg- 
up and down by a cam or crank- ing Press. (Fielding & Piatt, 
shaft. A clutch mechanism is fitted, Ltd., Gloucester.) 
by means of which this shaft is 
connected with or disconnected from 
the heavy driving-wheel at will to 
give a single stroke or a series of 
strokes to the ram. In the normal] 
state the ram remains stationary at' 
the top position. The lightest presses 
are driven direct by belt on the crank-shaft pulley, but in the heavier 
classes spur-gearing must be interposed between the pulley^ shaft 
and the final shaft. The operation of drawing requires an encircling 
die which presses on the blank as it lies on its die, the cupping 
of the blank being effected by the downward motion of the plunger.

This is why the machine shown in fig. 62 has an outer slide P, which 
is made to " dwell " with an even pressure, while the middle ram 
is moving down and drawing out the article. Blanking and cupping 
may be done as one continuous operation if the work is shallow. 

Inclinable presses are employed for certain classes of work, the 
object being to let the stamped articles slide down the slope of the 
bed as rapidly as they are produced, instead of having to be removed 
by the operator. Much work can be placed on the. dies by hand, 
but for producing large quantities of small articles automatic feeds

are employed whenever possible. A good deal of work is produced 
from flat sheet, supplied in the form of a roll and fed through rollers 
by intermittent movements to the dies. Circular turn-tables are 
also used, operated by ratchet devices, which turn the tables round 
to bring a ring of pockets, carrying the pieces, successively under 
the dies; the attendant keeps the pockets supplied, but his hands 
do not come near the dies. 

X. — Portable Tools 

The growth of portable machine tools is one of the remarkable 
movements of the present day. To some extent they have always 
been used, notably in the drilling and tapping operations of loco- 
motive fire-boxes, but "not until recently to any important extent 
in the ordinary fitting and erecting shops. The main reason lay 
in the difficulties due to transmission of power by ropes or shafts. 
The employment of compressed air, water, electricity^ and flexible 
shafts, by which long distances can be covered, has given new life 
to the portable system, which is destined to occupy a place of even 
greater importance than it does at present. The reason for the grow- 
ing desirability of these tools is to be seen in the massive character 
of much engine and machine construction of the present time. 
Although firms that undertake the largest work can generally arrange 
to tool the individual parts on machines of massive sizes, that only 
meets a part of the difficulty. Very big work cannot be treated 
like that of small or even medium dimensions, done repetitively; 
that is, it is not practicable to drill and bore and ream and provide 
for the fitting of every piece by the aid of templets and jigs, while 
the work lies on the machine, but a great deal of adjustment and 
mutual fitting has to be accomplished in the course of erection. 
Therein lies the opportunity for the portable machine. If this is 
not used the alternatives are partial dismantling of the work and 
the transference of certain portions to machines or hand work. 
Another cause has been the substitution of machining for much hand 
work formerly done on massive constructions. 

The principal operations for which portable tools are designed are 
the following: Drilling, screwing, cutting the seatings for keys, 
planing short portions of work, facings for the attachment of other 
pieces, as brackets and bearings, hammering operations, as in making 
welded joints, caulking the edges of boiler plates, chipping with 
hammer and chisel, riveting, ramming sand in foundry moulds, 
planing ships' decks, and some operations of lesser magnitude. 

Portable tools are used in various ways. The first and most 
obvious is to attach them directly to the casting, forging or machine 
which is being built up. Thus a drilling machine will be clamped 
just where it is required to operate. Or if it has tobeused on a 
large plane surface as a ship's deck, an electrical machine is suitable, 
in which magnetic attraction is set up between the foot of the machine 
and the deck sufficient to hold it down. A key-seating machine 
will be clamped on the shaft in which a^ keygroove has to be cut. 
A drilling machine may be fastened to a pipe with a chain embracing 
the pipe. Very many of the drills, and all the caulking and chipping 
hammers, are grasped in the hands and so thrust to their work. 
The tapping of screw holes is mostly done in this way, a common 
example being the holes for the stay bolts in the fire-boxes of steam 
boilers. 

Another later method^ which has been introduced and practised 
in a few shops consists in installing a cast-iron floor-plate of large 
area, planed truly and provided with bolt holes and slots. On this 
a massive casting, forging or piece of work undergoing erection will 
be bolted. Then the portable tools — planers, drills, &c, as required — 
will be bolted to the table and brought into operation on the various 
sections of the work, several sometimes operating simultaneously. 
This method is to a certain extent coming into rivalry with the 
abnormal growth of machine tools, the development of which has 
been greatly accelerated by the massive dimensions of productions 
which only became^ possible by the substitution of steel made by 
the Bessemer and Siemens processes for iron. 

The reciprocating motion necessary to effect hammering, chipping 
or caulking operations is produced by the action of a solid piston, 
sliding in a cylinder (fig. 63) and driven sharply against the end 
of the tool by the inrush of compressed air, being then returned 
for another stroke. The strokes range in number up to as many 
as 2000 per minute in some cases. For heavy riveting a "long- 
stroke " hammer is employed, having a longer barrel than the 
chipping hammer shown in fig. 63, in order to obtain a greater force 
of blow. The operator grasps the hammer by the handle, with his 
fingers or thumb on the controlling lever, andas long as this is held 
down the blows continue. The air-supply pipe is flexible, so that 
it does not impede the movements of the workman. The tools at 
the end of the cylinder are simply held in a socket, so that they can 
be changed rapidly. 

Rotative motion can be produced either by electric or pneumatic 
motors,and both systems are in wide use. Pneumatic motors arc 
very suitable when an air-compressing plant is already laid down 
for other tools, while if electricity is used in the works portable tools 
operated by this agent may be employed instead of the pneumatic 
ones. In the electric drills (fig. 64) a small motor is fitted within 
the body and^ connected by spur-gears to the spindle to effect suitable 
speed reduction. A switch provides for stopping and starting the 
motor; the current is brought through a flexible cable which, like 



pneumatic hose, is armoured with wire to protect it from damage. 
The smallest drills are simply gripped in the operator's hand and

registers with the hole M t air is admitted from a small hole 
(not shown), passes round the groove through hole M and 
passage N to the rear of the valve. This acting on the back of 
the valve throws it forward, thus shutting off the supply to the 
rear of the piston and permitting a small quantity of air to flow 
to the forward end of the piston for driving it in a backward 
direction. As soon as the air pressure is relieved on the 
back of the valve by the uncovering of exhaust holes^ (not 
seen) by the piston D, the valve is returned to the original 
position, owing to the air constantly pressing on the small area 
of the valve.

a screw at intervals.

Pneumatic drills are usually worked by little motors having 
oscillating cylinders, by which the air and exhaust ports are covered 
and uncovered. They run at a high speed and are geared down 
to the spindle. In some cases two cylinders are used, but often 
four are fitted to give a powerful and equable turning moment. 
Grinding machines are also built with air motors directly coupled 
to the wheel spindle, the machines being moved about over the work 
by handles. 

Another class of portable tools is driven, not by self-contained 
motors, but from an outside source of power, which is conveyed to 
the tools through flexible shafts built up of a series of spiral springs, 
or through flexible joints which form a connexion that permits the 
shaft to bend round corners and accommodate itself to any position 
in which the tool may be placed. The advantage of this is that the 
tool itself is much lightened, since there is no motor, and it can 
therefore be easily handled. Thus a drill simply contains the 
spindle, running in a frame which carries bevel-gears for transmitting 
the motion of the flexible shaft. Portable grinders also have nothing 
but the spindle, wheel and frame. 

XI. — Appliances 
Appliances are vastly more numerous in a modern shop than in 
the older works, largely on account of the more repetitive character

of the operations done and of the desire to eliminate human labour, 
with its greater cost and chances of inaccuracy in the finished pro- 
duct. On all machines there are numerous aids by which the fixing 
of the work is facilitated. Many of these consist of simple^ packing 
blocks, by which heights are adjusted. These reach their higher 
developments in wedge-shaped packings, some of which are operated 
by a screw, while others act directly by screws. In some cases the 
exact height can be ascertained by observing graduations on 
the packings. Circular work is held in V-blocks, which occur in 
numerous modified forms. Various kinds of straps, clamps and bolts 
are used for gripping work with sufficient security to enable it to 
withstand the stress of the heaviest cutting. The highest develop- 
ment of all is attained in the templets and jigs, which are now 
indispensable in all modern shops, and which increase in number 
and complexity as the product of the shop becomes more specialized. 
A templet is a piece of metal cut to a definite shape, which being 
laid upon the work becomes a guide for striking the same shape 
on the surface of the work with a pointed scriber, and by which the 
tooling of any number of similar pieces is done without the labour 
of lining out each separate piece. ^ Obviously, in such acase the 
degree of accuracy of the toonng still depends on the machine hand, 
who may work exactly, or only approximately, to these lines. Hence 
a great advance is made in tne jig, which may be defined generally 
as a templet that is clamped rigidly to the work, or a box in which 
the work to be tooled is held. No marking off is done, but the jig 
becomes the actual guide for the operation of the cutting tools. 
The operation most frequently performed in jigs is drilling. Then 
the holes in the jig receive and coerce the drills, so thatthe holes 
made cannot vary in the least degree from those already in the jig. 
As it will often happen that hundreds or thousands of similar pieces 
will have to be tooled in this manner, holes in jigs are generally 
bushed with hardened steel, which is capable of enduring very 
lengthy service, and which can be renewed when worn. This is 
a simple illustration, but many jigs are of an extremely elaborate 
character, for it is obvious that the cost of a jig, though it may run 
into many pounds, becomes a mere trifle when spread over some 
thousands of pieces of work. 

XII. — Wood-working Machinery 

There is a large range of various classes of tools for performing 
the operations on timber, from the rough log to the finished product. 
Division is effected by saws, planing and finishing to outlines by 
knives or cutters, boring by augers and smoothing by sandpaper. 

The first operation is that of tree-felling, which is often effected 
by machine, consisting of a reciprocating blade, working horizontally 
in a frame and moved by a steam cylinder. The boiler is separate, 
so that the machine may be transported about and set to work over 
a considerable area, steam being conveyed to it by a flexible pipe. 
When the trees are brought into the saw-mills in the form of logs, 
i.e. with the branches lopped off, they are often cross-cut to reduce 
them to suitable lengths. This operation is effected either by a 
reciprocating saw, operated by a pulley and crank, or by an electric 
motor, or else with a circular saw, travelling on a carriage which 
moves the saw through the log laid in front of it. The next opera- 
tion, that of division or breaking-down into smaller portions, is 
done by saws of various types, according to the class of work. The 
oldest form of machine is the frame-saw, which is still used very 
largely. It comprises a framing within which a saw-gate or saw- 
frame is reciprocated up and down by a crank; the frame holds a 
number of saws or webs of flat form, strained up tightly with wedges 
or cotters between the top and bottom < of the frame, the distance 
between the saws being capable of variation tojsuit boards of all 
thicknesses. The log is fed longitudinally to the gang of saws upon 
carriages, which are of two types. In the roller-feed, which is 
suitable for comparatively even and straight logs, ribbed rollers 
in front and behind the saws obtain a bite on the top and bottom 
of the timber and feed it forward by their rotation. In the rack-feed 
the log is mounted bodily upon a long carriage that runs by rollers 
upon a set of rails, and the carriage is travelled along by pinions and 
racks, which give a positive feed regardless of the shape of the log. 
The carriage in the roller-feed machines is only represented by a 
couple of plain trolleys supporting the timber at back and front. 
The feed is obtained through a friction wheel of V-shape, with a 
smooth pawl, called the silent feed; the wheel is given a partial 
rotation at each down stroke of the saw-gate to turn the rollers or 
the pinions for carrying forward the log. The division of the timber 
may be either into deals or flitches, or planks or boards. In the 
last-named case as many as fifty saw-blades are sometimes held in 
a frame. 

For the more valuable hardwoods a single blade reciprocating 
saw, operated horizontally, is used very largely, the machine being 
termed a board-cutter. The log is clamped to a travelling table, 
passing underneath the saw, which is strained in a frame sliding 
on a cross-rail that can be adjusted up or down on a couple of up- 
rights like a planing machine. The saw is worked from a crank and 
connecting-rod. As only one board is sawn at a time the attendant 
is able to see the figuring of the timber and to avoid waste when bad 
places are encountered. 

A machine much more rapid in operation is the horizontal band- 



saw, modelled on the lines of the above machine, but with a band- 
saw blade running over two pulleys, at a high speed, of about 7000 ft, 
per minute. The saws are very thin, so that a minimum of wood is 
wasted in the cut or " kerf,' a very important consideration in 
dealing with costly woods. Vertical band-saws, having one pulley 
above the other so that the blade runs vertically, are very popular 
in America; they occupy less floor space than the horizontal types. 
It is necessary to present the log from the side, and it is therefore 
clamped by dogs upon a carriage running on rails, with provision 
for feeding the log laterally to the saw by sliding ways on the carriage. 

The use of circular saws for breaking-down is confined chiefly 
to squaring up heavy balks, which need only a cut on each side, or 
for cutting thick slabs. The thickness of the saw entails considerable 
waste of wood, and a large amount of power is required for driving. 
The machines are termed rack-benches, and comprise a long divided 
table built up of thin plates and travelling past the fixed saw upon 
rollers, the movement being effected by a rack and pinion. 

Re-sawing machines are those designed for further cutting-up 
deals, flitches, planks, &c, already broken out from the log, into 
boards and other scantlings. The deal and flitch frames are built 
on the model of the frame-saws first described, but with the differ- 
ences that roller feed is always used, because the stuff is smooth and 
easily fed, and that the back of the timber is run against fences to 
keep it moving in a straight line. In the double equilibrium frames, 
which are much favoured, there are two sets of saws in separate 
frames^ connected by rods to^ opposite crank-shafts, so that as one 
frame is rising the other is going down ; the forces are thus balanced 
and vibration is diminished, so that the machines can be speeded 
rather higher. Re-sawing is also done on circular and band saws 
of various types^ fitted with fences for guiding the timber and 
controlling the thicknesses. 

The cross-cut saws constitute another large group. They are 
employed for cutting-off various classes of stuff, after breaking-down 
or re-sawing, and are of circular saw type. The pendulum saw is 
a suspended form, comprising a circular saw at the bottom of a hang- 
ing arm, which can be pulled over by the attendant to draw the 
saw through a piece ofwood laid on a bench beneath. Circular 
saws are also mounted in tables or benches and made to part off 
stuff moved laterally upon asliding-table. When there is sufficient 
repetition work machines with two or more saws are used to cut 
one or more pieces to accurate length without the necessity for 
measurement. 

The lighter classes of circular and band-saws, employed for sawing 
up comparatively small pieces of timber, embody numerous provisions 
for quickening output. The plain saw benches, with circular saws, 
are the simplest class, consisting merely of a framed table or bench 
carrying bearings for the saw spindle and a fence on the top to guide 
the wood. A mechanical feed is incorporated in the heavier machines 
to push the timber along. The rope-feed mechanism includes a 
drum driven at varying rates and giving motion to a rope, which is 
connected with a hook to the timber, to drag it along past the saw, 
roller supports on rails taking the weight at each end of the bench. 
Roller-feed saws propel the stuff by the contact of vertical fluted 
rollers placed opposite the fence. Other classes of saws for joinery 
work, &c, are constructed with rising and falling spindles, so that 
the saw may be made to project more or less from the table, this 
provision being necessary in grooving and tonguing with special 
types of saws. The same effect is obtained by making the table 
instead of the spindle rise and fall. 

As it is necessary to use different saws for ripping (with the grain) 
and cross-cutting, some machines embody two saw^s so 'that work 
can be cut to shape on the same machine. These " dimension saws " 
have two spindles at the opposite ends of a pivoted arm that can 
be turned on a central pin to bring one or the other saw above as 
required. In cases where much angular and intricate sawing is 
done universal benches are employed, having in addition to the 
double saws a tilting motion to tne table, which in conjunction with 
various special fittings enables the^ sawyer to produce a large range 
of pieces for any class of construction. 

Band-saws, which have a thin narrow blade, are adapted especi- 
ally for curved sawing and cutting-out work which the circular saw 
cannot manage. The usual design of machine (fig. 65) comprises a stiff 
standard supporting a lower pulley in fixed bearings, and an upper 
one in a sliding bearing, which by means of a weight or spring is 
caused to rise and maintain an even tension on the saw blade as it 
is driven by the lower pulley, and runs the upper one. India-rubber 
tires are placed around the pulley rims to prevent damage to the 
saw teeth. The table, placed between the pulleys, may be angled 
for cutting bevel work. It is necessary, in order to do true work, 
to guide the saw blade above and below the cut, andit is therefore 
run in guides consisting of flat strips, in combination with anti- 
friction rollers which take the backward thrust of the saw. Fret 
or jig saws are a small class with a vertical reciprocating blade, 
employed chiefly for cutting out interior portions which necessitate 
threading the saw first through a hole. 

Planing machines, used for truing up the surfaces of wood after 
sawing, depend for their action upon rapidly revolving knives 
fastened to flat-sided cutter blocks. The simplest machines, the 
hand-planers, have a cutter cylinder revolving between two flat

table slides adjustable for height to support the wood while it is 
pushed along over the knives by thehand. A fence guides it in a 
straight line. Exact thicknessing is done on another type of 
machine, the panel planer or thicknesses in which the cutter cylinder 
revolves above .the table and the stuff is fed through by rollers above

and below. By altering the height of the table the thickness of 
wood can be varied. Double machines include a cutter cylinder 
above and below the timber, so that the upper anfi under sides are 
planed simultaneously. A combination of the hand-planer and 
the thjeknesser is useful in cases where space or expenditure must 
be limited. 

When large quantities of planed stuff are wanted, such as for 
flooring-boards, &c, other types of machines are employed. The 
four-cutter planers are the most rapid in output, and the timber 
is passed through them at a high rate, ranging up to 150 ft. per 
minute. There is first a revolving cutter cylinder, which roughs 
off the underside of the stuff, whence it passes (being propelled by 
rollers) to a fixed knife which imparts a very smooth face. A little 
farther on in the machine two vertical cutter blocks are encountered 
which carry cutters to plane or tongue or mould the edges, after 
which another cylinder above finishes the top face. Similar types 
of machines are made to produce mouldings, using four cutters 
shaped to suit the pattern required. 

Moulding is also done on the vertical spindle shapers, which carry 
a cutter or cuttersat the top of a spindle projecting through a flat 
table. The work is slid over the table and controlled by touching 
a collar below^ the cutter. Any form may be given to the cutters 
to produce different profiles. Some special moulding machines 



use a cutter at the end of a spindle projecting downwards from an 
arm overhanging a table, an arrangement which enables recessing 
and carving to be performed. 

Boring machines comprise rotating spindles and feeding mechanism 
to actuate augers. The single spindle machines are satisfactory 
enough for ordinary work, but when a number of differently sized 
holes have to be bored in a single piece of work, or in rapid succession, 
it is the practice to employ a machine with a number of spindles, so 
that a succession of augers of graduated diameters may be ready 
to use at will. 

Mortising or cutting slots is done in vertical machines with a 
reciprocating spindle, operated either by hand or by crank disk 
and pulleys. The tool that cuts the mortise resembles a wood- 
worker's chisel, but is of stouter form and has a suitable shank to 
fit in the spindle. The latter can be reversed to turn round and let 
the chisel face in the opposite direction for cutting at each end of a

mortise. A boring spindle is often incorporated with the machine 
to make holes for the mortising chisel to start in (fig. 66). Another 
class of mortiser employs a square hollow chisel, inside of which an 
auger rotates and first bores a hole, leaving to the chisel the duty 
of finishing out the corners. The chain mortiser is another type; 
it has an endless chain of flat links, sharpened to make cutting teeth, 
and is run around a bar and a roller at a high speed, so that when 
fed into the wood a recess or mortise is cut out. 

Tenoning machines, designed to cut the reduced ends or tenons 
to fit in mortises, perform their work by the aid of cutter blocks, 
revolved on horizontal sp ; ndles above and below the timber, which 
is fed laterally upon a sliding carriage. 

Dovetailing is effected by revolving cutters in machines having 
mechanism for pitching out the cuts, or if the work warrants it an 
entire row of dovetails is made at one traverse, by fitting a row of

cutters and feeding simultaneously. Corner-locking, or cutting 
parallel tongues and grooves in the^ edges of boxes, &o, is a rather 
more rapid operation than dovetailing, and is done with suitable 
cutter blocks or disks of appropriate thickness and pitching apart. 

The general joiner, as its name implies, will do a large variety of 
operations, and is used in shops and on estates where a complete 
plant of machines would be out of the question. It usually has a 
circular saw and sometimes a band-saw also, together with planing 
and moulding apparatus, a moulding spindle, boring spindle and 
tenoning apparatus.^ 

The lathes used in woodworking comprise the plain hand types 
with a simple T-rest on which the turner rests the tools to deal with 
the work revolving between centres, and the copying or Blanchard 
lathes, in which a master form or copy is rotated and caused by the 
contact and coercion of a roller to move the cutter rest in a corre- 
sponding fashion, so that the work is cut away until it exactly 
matches the shape of the copy. 

Sand-papering machines, which finish the surface of wood to a 
high degree, deal with both flat and curved faces. _ Flat boards, 
panels, &c, can be done by contact against revolving drums or 
disks covered with glass-paper, being fed along over them by hand 
or by rotating rollers. In one class of machinea revolving disk is 
placed at the end of a series of jointed arms, by which the disk can 
be moved about over the work resting on a table underneath. 

XIII. — Measurement 

An advance of the greatest importance made in mechanical 
engineering is that of measurement. Since the beginning of the ioth 
century steady movement has been going on in this direction until it 
seems impossible that much greater refinement can now be looked for. 
Probably the chief advances to be expected will lie in the general 
extension in workshop practice of the knowledge already acquired, 
rather than in the acquisition of higher degrees of refinement. 

Methods of measurement adopted in woodworking have but little 
application in high-class engineers' work. They are adopted, how- 
ever, to a considerable extent in the metal trades which are allied 
to engineering, as sheet metal working, girder work, &c. When a 
carpenter or joiner sets about constructing a door, window sash, 
roof or box he takes a two-foot rule, a flat lead pencil, and marks off 
the dimensions and lines by^ which he intends to work. If he has to 
work very carefully, then instead of using a pencil he cuts a line 
with the edge of a keen scribcr or chisel-like tool, by which to saw, 
plane or chisel. If outlines are curved, the compasses are brought 
into requisition, and these cut a fine line or lines on the surface of 
the wood. But in any case the eye alone judges of the coincidence 
ol the cutting with the lines marked. Whether the tool used be saw, 
chisel, gouge or plane, the woodworker estimates by sight alone 
whether or not the lines marked are worked by. 

The broad difference between his method and that of the engineer's 
machinist lies in this, that while the first tests his work by the eye, 
the second judges of its accuracy or otherwise by the sense of touch. 
It may seem that there cannot be very much difference in these two 
methods, but there is. To the first, the sixty-fourth part ofan inch 
is a fine dimension, to the second one-thousandth of an inch is rather 
coarse. Now the thickness of tissue paper is about one-thousandth 
of an inch, and no one could possibly work so closely as that by the 
eye alone. Engineers' steel rules usually have one inch which is 
divided into one hundred parts. Tolerably keen sight is required 
to distinguish those divisions, and few could work by them by ocular 
measurement alone, that is, by placing them in direct juxtaposition 
with the work. A thousandth part of an inch seems by com- 
parison a fine dimension. But it is very coarse when considered 
in relation to modern methods of^ measurement. In what are called 
" limit gauges " the plugs and rings are made of slightly different 
dimensions. If a plug is made a thousandth of an inch less than 
its ring it will slip^ through it easily with very perceptible slop. 
The common rule is therefore scarcely seen in modern machine 
shop, while the common calipers fill but a secondary place, their 
function having been invaded by the gauges. A minute dimension 
cannot be tested by lines of division on a rule, neither can a dimen- 
sion which should be fixed be tested with high precision with a 
movable caliper of ordinary type. Yet it must not be supposed 
that the adoption of the system of gauging instead of the older 
methods of rule measurement relieves men of responsibility. The 
instruments of precision require delicate handling. Rough forcing 
of gauges will not yield correct results. A clumsy workman is as 
much out of place in a modern machine shop as he would be in a 
watch factory. Without correctness of measurement mechanical 
constructions would be impossible, and the older device of mutual 
fitting of parts is of lessening value in face of the growth of the inter- 
changeable system, of international standards, and of automatic 
machine tools which are run with no intervention save that of feeding 
stock. 

The two broad divisions of measurement by sight and by contact 
are represented in a vast number of instruments. To the first- 
named belong the numerous rules in wood and metal and with 
English and metric divisions, and the scales which are used for 
setting out dimensions on drawings smaller than those of the real 
objects, but strictly proportional thereto. The second include all 



the gauges. These are either fixed or movable, an important sub- 
division. The first embrace two groups — one for daily workshop 
service, the other for testing and correcting the wear of these, hence 
termed " reference gauges." They are either made to exact standard 
sizes, or they embody limits of tolerance," that is, allowances for 
certain classes of fits, and for the minute degrees of inaccuracy 
which are permissible in an interchangeable system of manufacture. 
The movable group includes a movable portion, either correspond- 
ing^ with one leg of a caliper orhaving an adjustable rod, with pro- 
vision for precise measurement in the form of a vernier or of a screw 
thread divided micrometrically. These may be of general character 
for testing internal or external diameters, or for special functions 
as screw threads. Subtitles indicate some particular aspect or 
design of the gauges, as " plug and ring," " caliper," " horseshoe," 
" depth," " rod," " end measure," &c. So severe are the require- 
ments demanded of instruments of measurement that the manu- 
facture of the finer kinds remains a speciality in the hands of a very 
few firms. The cost and experience necessary are so great that 
prices rule high for the best instruments. As these, however, are 
not required for ordinary workshop use, two or three grades are 
manufactured, the limits of inaccuracy being usually stated and a 
guarantee given that these are not exceeded. 

Measurement by Sight. Rules and Scales. — The rules are used 
for marking off distances and dimensions in conjunction with other 
instruments, as scribers, compasses, dividers, squares; and for test- 
ing and checking dimensions when marked, and work in course of 
reduction or erection, directly or from calipers. They are made in 
boxwood and in steel, the latter being either rigid or flexible, as 
when required to go round curves. Rules are fitted in combination 
with other instruments, as sliding calipers, squares, depth gauges, 
&c. The scales are of boxwood, of ivory, the value of which is dis- 
counted by its shrinkage, and of paper. They are of flat section 
with bevelled edges, and of oval and of triangular sections, each 
giving a thin edge to facilitate readings. They are fully divided, 
or open divided; in the first case each division is alike subdivided, 
in the second only the end ones are thus treated. 

The Gauges. Fixed Gauges. — These now embrace several kinds, 
the typical forms being represented by the cylindrical or plug and 
ring gauges and by the caliper form or snap gauges. The principle 
in each is that a definite dimension being embodied in the gauge, 
the workman has not to refer to the rule, either directly dr through 
the medium of a caliper. This distinction, though slight, is of 
immense importance in modern manufacturing. Broadly it corre- 
sponds with the difference between the older heterogeneous and the 
present interchangeable systems. 

Plug and Ring Gauges. — The principal ones and the originals of 
all the rest, termed Whitworth gauges after the inventor, are the 
plug and ring gauges (fig. 67, A and 
B). The principle on which they 
depend is tnat U the two gauges are 
made to fit with perfect accuracy, 
without tightness on the one hand 
or slop on the other, then any 
work which is measured or turned 
and bored or ground by them will 
also fit with equal accuracy. Bored 
holes are tested by the plug gauge, 
and spindles are tested by the 
ring gauge, and such spindles and 
holes make a close fit if the work 
is done carefully. Of course, in prac- 
tice, there is very much variation in 
the character of the work done, 
and the finest gauges are too fine 
for a large proportion of engineers' o 

work. It is possible to make these Pig 67 

gauges within „4„ of an inch. ^ B Plug and r ' ing ga 
But they are seldom required so c Difference gauge

generally fine enough For general A Stepped reference gauge, 
shop work the gauges are made to within about -j-bVit of ai > 
inch. Standard gauges in which the plug and ring are of the 
same diameter will only fit by the application of a thin film of oil 
and by keeping the plug in slight movement within the ring. 
Without these precautions the two would " seize " so hard that they 
could not be separated without force and injury. 

Plug and Ring v. Horseshoe Gauges. — The horseshoe, snap or 
caliper gauges (fig. 68) are often used in preference to the plug and 
ring types. They are preferred because the surfaces in contact 
are narrow. These occur in various designs, with and without 
handles, separately and in combination and in a much larger range 
of dimensions than the plug and ring. Ring gauges are not quite 
such delicate instruments as the fixed caliper gauges. But since 
they measure diameter only, and turned work is not always quite 
circular, the caliper gauges are not so convenient for measurement 
as the round gauges, which fit in the same manner as the parts have 
to fit to one another. 

Fixed Gauges. Limit Gauges. — Some fits have to be what 
is termed in the shops " driving fits," that is, so tight that they 




44 



TOOL 



[MEASUREMENT 



have to be effected by driving with a hammer or a press, while 
others have to be " working fits," suitable, say, for the revolution of 
a loose pulley on its shaft or of an axle in its bearings. The " limit " 
or " difference gauges " (figs. 67 and 68) are designed for producing 
these working fits; that is, the plug and ring gauges differ in dimen- 
sions so that the work bored will drive tightly, or slide freely over

fourths and the vernier into twenty-five parts, or the beam is divided 
into fiftieths of an inch (fig. 70) and the vernier has 20 divisions to

and internal dimensions. These "beam calipers" are also made 
for metric divisions. Minor variations in design by different 
manufacturers arc numerous.

which is generally accepted is embodied in the gaugesby the Newall 
Engineering Co. These embrace force fits, which require the applica- 
tion of a screw or hydraulic press; driving fits, that require less 
power, as that of a hammer; push fits, in which a spindle can be 
thrust into its hole by hand; and running fits, such as that of shafts 
in bearings. Fixed gauges are made for each of these, but as this 
involves a heavy outlay the Newall firm have adjustable limit 
gauges (fig. 68, D) for external^ dimensions, the standard plug being 
used for holes. The setting is done by screwed plugs or anvils 
adjusted by reference bars. In all these gauges the " go on M and 
" not go on " ends respectively are stamped on the gauge, or the 
equivalents of + and — . 

Fixed Reference^ Gauges. Reference Disks and End Measuring 
Rods. — Shop working gauges become in time so damaged by service 
that they fail to measure so accurately as when new. To correct 
these errors reference gauges are provided, by which the inaccuracy of 
the worn ones is brought to the test. These are never used in the 
shops for actual measurement of work, but are only kept for checking 
the truth of the working gauges. _ They include disk, stepped and 
end_ measurement gauges. The disk and the stepped are used for 
testing the ring gauges, the stepped kind comprising essentially a 
collection of disks in one piece (ng. 67, D). The end measure pieces 
test the external gauges. The end measure standard lengths 
made by the Pratt & Whitney Co. are so accurate that any sizes 
taken at random in any numbers from } in. to 4 in., varying by 
sixteenths of an inch, will, when placed end to end, make up an exact 
length; this is a difficult test, since slight variations in the lengths of 
the components would add up materially when multiplied by the 
number of pieces. The ends are ground off with diamond dust or 
emery in a special machine under water, and are so true that one 
piece will support another by cohesive force, and this though the 
surfaces are less than J in. square. 

Movable Gauges. — This extensive group may be regarded as 
compounded of the common caliper and the Whitworth measuring 
machine. They are required when precise dimensions have to be 
ascertained in whole numbers and minute fractional parts. They 
combine the sense of touch by^ contact, as in the calipers, with the 
exact dimensions obtained by inspection of graduated scales, either 
the vernier or the micrometer screw. If gauges must not vary by 
more than ttW of an _ inch, which is the limit imposed by 
modern shop ideals, then instruments must be capable of measuring 
to finer dimensions than this. Hence, while the coarser classes of 
micrometers read directly to ^ftnr part of an inch, the finest 
measure up to^Anr of an inch, about 200 times as fine as the 
diameter of a human hair. They range in price correspondingly 
from about a sovereign to £100. 

The Calipers.— Common calipers (fig. 69) are adjusted over or 
within work, and the dimensions are taken therefrom by a rule or a 
gauge. They usually have no provision for minute adjustment 
beyond the gentle tapping of one of the legs when setting. In some

Vernier Calipers. — The vernier fitting, so named after its inventor, 
Pierre Vernier, in 1631, is fitted to numerous calipers and caliper 
rules. It is applied to calipers for engineers' use to read tor^r 
of an inch without requiring a magnifier. The beam of the caliper 
is divided into inches and tenths of the inch, and each tenth into

Micrometer Calipers are the direct offspring of the Whitworth 
measuring machine. In the original form of this machine a screw 
of 20 threads to the inch, turned by a worm-wheel of 200 teeth 
and single-threaded worm, had a wheel on the axis of the worm with 
250 divisions on its circumference, so that an adjustment of osfonrnof 
an inch was possible. The costly measuring machines made to-day 
have a dividing wheel on the screw, but they combine modifications 
to ensure freedom from error, the fruits of prolonged experience. 
Good machines are made by the Whitworth, the Pratt & Whitney, 
the Newall (fig. 71), and the Brown & Sharpe firms. These are 
used for testing purposes. But there are immense numbers of small 
instruments, the micrometer calipers (fig. 72), made for general 
shop use, measuring directly to j^ of an inch, and in the

pitch is 40 to the inch, and the circular divisions number 25, so that 
a movement of one division indicates that the screw has been ad- 
vanced £s of & or x^fl of an inch. Provision for correcting or 
taking up the effects of wear is included in these designs (e.g. at 
a in fig. 72), and varies with different manufacturers. A vernier is 
sometimes fitted in addition, in very high class instruments, to the 
circular divisions, so that readingsof ten thousandths of an inch can 
be taken. Beam micrometer calipers (fig. 73) take several inches 
in length, the micrometer being reserved for fractional parts of the 
inch only. 

Depth Gauges.— It is often necessary to measure the depth of 
one portion of a- piece of work below another part, or the height of 
one portion relatively to a lower one. To hold a rule perpendicularly 
and take a sight is not an accurate method, because the same 
objections apply to this as to rule measurement in a general. There 
are many depth gauges made with rule divisions simply, and then 
these have the advantage of a shouldered face which rests upon the 
Upper portion of the work and from which the rule measurement is

But for very accurate work either the vernier or the micrometer 
fitting is applied, so that depths can be measured in thousandths 
of an inch, or sometimes in sixty-fourths, or in metric subdivisions.

Rod Gauges. — When internal diameters have to be taken, too 
large for plug gauges or calipers to span, the usual custom is to set 
a rod of iron or steel across, file it till it fits the bore, and then 
measure its length with a rule. More accurate as well as adjust- 
able are the rod gauges (fig. 75) to which the vernier or the micro- 
meter are fitted. These occur in a few varied designs. 

Screw Thread Gauges. — The taking of linear dimensions, though 
provided for so admirably by the systems of gauging just dis- 
cussed, does not cover the important section of screw measurement. 
This is a department of the highest importance. In most English 
shops the only test to-day of the size of a screw or nut is the use 
of a standard screw or nut. That there is variation in these is 
evidenced by the necessity for fitting nuts to bolts when large

numbers of these are being assembled, after they have been used 
in temporary erections or when nuts are brought from the stores 
to fit studs or bolts cut in the shop. This method may suffice in 
many classes of work, but it is utterly unsuited to an interchange- 
able system; and when there is a fair amount of the latter firms 
sometimes make thread gauges of their own,in general form like 
the plug and ring gauges, using a hard quality of steel for small 
sizes or a tough quality of cast iron for the larger. These, though 
not hardened, will endure for a long time if treated carefully. But

though very useful and far better than none at all they lack two 
essentials. They^ are simply accommodation gauges, made to an 
existing tap or die, and do not therefore embody any precise abso- 
lute measurement, nor do they include 
any means for measuring variations from 
standard, nor are they hardened. To 
produce gauges to fulfil these require- 
ments demands an original standard to 
work by, micrometric measurements, and 
the means of grinding after the harden- 
ing process. These requirements are 
fulfilled in the screw thread gauges and 
calipers of the Pratt & Whitney and the 
Brown & Sharpe companies. The essen- 
tial feature. of a screw gauge is that it 
measures the sides of the threads with- 
out risk of a possible false reading due 
to contact on the bottom or top of the 
V. This is fulfilled by flatting the top 
and making the bottom of the gauge 
keen. The Pratt & Whitney gauges are 
made as a plug and ring (fig. 76), the 
plug being solid and the ring capable of 
precise adjustment round it. There is 
a plain round end, ground and lapped 
exactly to the standard size of the bottom 
of the thread, a dimension which is 

obliterated in the threaded end because of the bottoms of the 
angles being made keen for clearance. There are three kinds of 
this class of gauge made ; the first and most expensive is hardened 
and ground in the angle, while the second is hardened but not 
ground.^ The first is intended for use when a very perfect gauge 
is required, the second for ordinary shop usage. The third is 
made unhardened for purposes of reference simply, and it is 
not brought into contact with the work to be tested^ at all, 
but measurements are taken by calipers; in every detail it repre- 
sents the standard threads. The Brown & Sharpe appliance is 
of quite a different character.^ It is a micrometer caliper having 
a fixed V and a movable point between which the screw to be 
measured is embraced. By the reading of the micrometerand 
the use of a constant the diameter of any thread in the middle 
of the thread can be estimated. 

Miscellaneous. — The foregoing do not exhaustthe gauges. There 
are gauges for the sectional shapes of screw threads of all pitches, 
gauges for drilled holes that have to be screwed, gauges for the 
depth and thickness of the teeth of gear-wheels, gauges for the tapers 
of machine spindles, gauges for key-grooves, &c. There are also 
the woodworker's gauges — the marking and cutting, the panel, 
the mortise and the long-tooth. 

Indicators are a small group of measuring instruments of a rather 
peculiar character. They magnify the most minute error by adapta- 
tions of long and short lever arms. The Bath, the Starrett and the 
Brown & Sharpe are familiar in high-class shops. Some simply 
magnify inaccuracy, but in one type an index reads to thousandths

Surface Plates and Cognate Forms. — Allied to the gauges are the 
instruments for testing the t truth of plane surfaces: the surface 
plates, straight-edges and winding strips. The origination of plane 
surfaces by scraping, until the mutual coincidence of three plates- 
is secured, was due to Whitworth. These surface plates (fig. 78, A) 
fill an important place in workshop practice, since in the best 
work plane surfaces are tested on them and corrected by scraping. 
To a large extent the precision grinding machines have lessened 
the value of scraping, but it is still retained for machine slides 
and other work of a similar class. In the shops there are two 
classes of surface plates: those employed daily about the shops, 
the accuracy of which becomes impaired in time, and the standard

smaller straight-edges are gener 
ally parallel, and a similar pair 
constitutes " winding strips," by 
which any twist or departure 
from a plane surface is detected. 
Squares, of which there are numer- 
ous designs (fig. 78, C and D), are 
straight-edges set at right angles. 
Bevels or oevcl-squares (fig. 79), 
are straight-edges comprising a 
stock and a blade, which are ad- 
justable for angle in relation to 
each other. Shop protractors often p JG 7Q 

include a blade adjustable for ^ Common bevel

tions. Spirit-levels test the hon- j ans \ es 

zontal truth of surfaces. Many^ * 

levels have two bubble tubes at right angles with each other, one 
of which tests the truth of vertical faces. Generally levels have 
flat feet, but some are made of V-section to fit over shafting. The 
common plumb-bob is in frequent use for locating the vertical 
position of centres not in the same horizontal plane. When a.

plumb-bob is combined with a parallel straight-edge the term plumb-

TOOLE, JOHN LAWRENCE (1832-1906), English actor, son 
of an old employe of the East India Company who for many years 
acted as toast-master in the City of London, was born in London 
on the 1 2th of March 1832. He was educated at the City of 
London School, and started life in a wine merchant's office; but 
his natural propensity for comic acting was not to be denied, and 
after some practice as an amateur with the City Histrionic Club, 
he definitely took to the stage in 1852, appearing in Dublin as 
Simmons in The Spitalfields Weaver. He gained experience in 
the provinces, and in 1854 made his first professional appearance 
in London at the St James's theatre, acting Samuel Pepys in 
The King's Rival and Weazel in My Friend the Major. In 1857, 
having just had a great success as Paul Pry, he met Henry 
Irving in Edinburgh, and recommended him to go to* London; 
and their friendship remained thenceforth of the closest kind. 
In 1858 Toole joined Webster at the Adelphi, and established 
his popularity as a comedian, among other parts creating Joe 
Spriggins in Ici on parte franqais. In 1868 he was engaged at 
the Gaiety, appearing among other pieces in Thespis, the first 
Gilbert and Sullivan collaboration. His fame was at its height 
in 1874, when he went on tour to the United States, but he failed 
to reproduce there the success he had in England. In 1879 he 
took the " Folly " theatre in London, which he renamed " Toole's " 
in 1882. He was constantly away in the provinces, but he pro- 
duced here a number of plays: H. J. Byron's Upper Crust and 
Auntie; Pinero's Hester's Mystery and Girls and Boys; burlesques 
such as Paw Claudian, and, later, J. M. Barrie's Walker, London. 
But his appearances gradually became fewer, and after 1893 he 
was seen no more on the London stage, while his theatre was 
pulled down shortly afterwards for an extension of Charing Cross 
Hospital. He published his reminiscences in 1888. Toole 
married in 1854; and the death of his only son in 1879, and later 
of his wife and daughter, had distressing effects on his health; 
attacks of gout, from 1886 onwards, crippled him, and ultimately 
he retired to Brighton, where after a long illness he died on the 
30th of July 1906. In his prime he was immensely popular, 
and also immensely funny in a way which depended a good deal 
on his tricks and delivery of words. He excelled in what may 
be called Dickens parts — combining humour and pathos. He 
was a good man of business, and left a considerable fortune, 
out of which he made a number of bequests to charity and to 
his friends. His genial and sympathetic nature was no less 
conspicuous off the stage than on it. 

TOOMBS, ROBERT (1810-1885), American political leader, 
was born near Washington, Wilkes county, Georgia, on the 
2nd of July 1810. He was educated at Franklin College (univer- 
sity of Georgia), at Union College, Schenectady, New York, 
from which he graduated in 1828, and at the law school of the 
university of Virginia. He was admitted to the bar in 1830, 
and served in the Georgia House of Representatives (1838, 
1840-1841 and 1843-1844), in the Federal House of Represen- 
tatives (1845-1853), and in the United States Senate (1853- 
1861). He opposed the annexation of Texas, the Mexican War, 
President Polk's Oregon policy, and the Walker Tariff of 1846. 
In common with Alexander H. Stephens and Howell Cobb, he 
supported the Compromise Measures of 1850, denounced the 
Nashville Convention, opposed the secessionists in Georgia, and 
helped to frame the famous Georgia platform (1850). His 
position and that of Southern Unionists during the decade 1850- 
1860 has often been misunderstood. They disapproved of 
secession, not because they considered it wrong in principle, 
but because they considered it inexpedient. On the dissolution 
of the Whig party Toombs went over to the Democrats. He 
favoured the Kansas-Nebraska Bill, the admission of Kansas 
under the Lecompton Constitution, and the English Bill (1858), 
and on the 24th of June 1856 introduced in the Senate the 
Toombs Bill, which proposed a constitutional convention in 
Kansas under conditions which were acknowledged by various 
anti-slavery leaders as fair, and which mark the greatest con- 



cessions made by the pro-slavery senators during the Kansas 
struggle. The bill did not provide for the submission of the 
constitution to popular vote, and the silence on this point of the 
territorial law under which the Lecompton Constitution of 
Kansas was framed in 1857 was the crux of the Lecompton 
struggle (see Kansas). In the presidential campaign of i860 
he supported John C. Breckinridge, and on the 22nd of December, 
soon after the election of Lincoln, sent a telegram to Georgia 
which asserted that " secession by the 4th of March next should 
be thundered forth from the ballot-box by the united voice of 
Georgia." He delivered a farewell address in the Senate 
(Jan. 7, 1861), returned to Georgia, and with Governor Joseph 
E. Brown led the fight for secession against Stephens and 
Herschel V. Johnson (1812-1880). His influence was a most 
powerful factor in inducing the " old-line Whigs " to support 
immediate secession. After a short term as secretary of state in 
President Davis's cabinet, he entered the army (July 21, 1861), 
and served first as a brigadier-general in the Army of Northern 
Virginia and after 1863 as adjutant and inspector-general of 
General G. W. Smith's division of Georgia militia. He then spent 
two years in exile in Cuba, France and England, but returned to 
Georgia in 1867, and resumed the practice of law. Owing to his 
refusal to take the oath of allegiance, he was never restored to the 
full rights of citizenship. He died at his home in Washington, 
Georgia, on the 1 5th of December 1 885.

TOOTHWORT, the popular name for a small British plant of 
curious form and growth, known botanically as Lathraea squa- 
maria. It grows parasitically on roots, chiefly of hazel, in shady 
places such as hedge sides. It consists of a branched whitish 
underground stem closely covered with thick fleshy colourless 
leaves, which are bent over so as to hide the under surface; 
irregular cavities communicating with the exterior are formed 
in the thickness of the leaf. On the inner wall of these chambers 
are stalked hairs, which when stimulated by the touch of an 
insect send out delicate filaments by means of which the insect 
is killed and digested. The only portions that appear above 
ground are the short flower-bearing shoots, which bear a spike of 
two-lipped dull purple flowers. The scales which represent the 
leaves also secrete water, which escapes and softens the ground 
around the plant. Lathraea is closely allied to another British 
parasitic plant, broomrape (Orobanche). 

TOOWOOMBA, a town of Aubigny county, Queensland, 
Australia, 76 m. by rail W. by N. of Ipswich, and 101 m. from 
Brisbane. It is situated on the summit of the Great Dividing 
Range, and is the centre of the rich pastoral and agricultural 
district of Darling Downs. The chief buildings are the town-hall, 
a large theatre, a school of arts and a library; the Christian 
Brothers College and several handsome churches. The industries 
are brewing, tanning, soap-boiling, flour-milling, malting, iron- 
founding, saw-milling and jam-making. Vineyards are culti- 
vated by a German colony and large quantities of wine are made. 
The town received a municipal charter in i860, and during the 
governorship of Lord Lamington (1896-1897) became the summer 
residence of the governor and his staff. Pop. (1001), 9137;

TOP (cf. Dan. top, Ger. Topf, also meaning pot), a toy consist- 
ing of a body of conical, circular or oval shape with a point or 
peg on which it turns or is made to whirl. The twisting or whirl- 
ing motion is applied by whipping or lashing when it is a " whip- 
ping top" or " peg-top," or by the rapid unwinding of a string 
tightly wound round a head or handle. When the body is 
hollow this results in a whirring noise, whence the name " hum- 
ming top." Other kinds of tops are made as supports for coloured 
disks which on revolving show a kaleidoscopic variation of 
patterns. The top is also used in certain games of chance, when 
it is generally known as a " teetotum." There are many references 
to it in ancient classical literature. The Greek terms for the 
toy are peppi!;, which was evidently the whipping or peg top 
(Arist. Birds, 1461), and crrp6/3iXos, a humming top, spun by a 
string (Plato, Rep. iv. 436 E.). In Homer (//. xiv. 413) the word 



48 



TOPAZ— TOPEKA 



cTpdfxpos seems to point to the humming top. The Latin name 
for the top was turbo. This word and the Greek fidfxpos are 
sometimes translated by " top " when they refer to the 
instrument used in the Dionysiac mysteries, which, when 
whirled in the air by a string, produced a booming noise. This 
was no doubt the equivalent of the " bull roarer " (q.v.)* Strutt 
(Games and Pastimes, 491) says that the top was known in 
England as early as the 14th century. For the scientific 
properties of the top see Gyroscope and Gyrostat. 

This word must be distinguished from that signifying the highest 
or uppermost part of anything. It appears to have meant origin- 
ally a tuft or crest of hair, cf. Ger. Zopf, Du. top, Icel. topps y &c; 
it is allied to Eng. " tap/' a spike for a cask, and " tip, point. 
Some etymologists^ have identified the two words, the toy being 
so called from spinning on its top or tip, but the two German 
forms seem to prove conclusively that the words are different. 

TOPAZ, a mineral usually found in connexion with granitic 
rocks and used, when fine, as a gem-stone. It is believed that 
the topaz of modern mineralogists was unknown to the ancients, 
and that the stone described under the name of roirk^vos, in 
allusion to its occurrence on an island in the Red Sea known as 
ro7rdf toy vrjoos, was the mineral which is now termed chrysolite 
or peridot (q.v.). The Hebrew pitdah, translated " topaz " in 
the Old Testament, may also have been the chrysolite. 

Topaz crystallizes in the orthorhombic system, usually with a 
prismatic habit (figs. 1 and 2). Many of the crystals, like those 
from Saxony and Siberia, are rich in faces, and present with the 
prisms a complicated combination of pyramids and domes. The 
faces of the prism-zone are usually striated vertically. Doubly- 
terminated crystals are rare, and sometimes apparently hemi- 
morphic. The mineral presents a perfect cleavage transverse

to the long axis of the prism, and the cleavage-plane often has a 
pearly lustre. The chemical composition of the topaz has given 
rise to much discussion, but it is now generally regarded as an 
aluminium fluo-silicate having the formula Al 2 F 2 Si0 4 . It was 
shown by Professor S. L. Penfield and Mr J. C. Minor that the 
fluorine may be partially replaced by hydroxy!. When strongly 
heated topaz suffers considerable loss of weight. Sir D. Brewster 
found in topaz numerous microscopic cavities containing fluids, 
some of which have received the names of brewsterlinite and 
cryptolinite. Possibly some of the liquid inclusions may be 
hydrocarbons. 

The topaz, when pure, may be colourless, and if cut as a 
brilliant has been mistaken for diamond. It has, too, the 
same specific gravity, about 3-5. It is, however, greatly 
inferior in hardness, the hardness of topaz being only 8; and it 
has lower refractivity and dispersive powers: moreover, being an 
orthorhombic mineral, it possesses double refraction. From 
phenacite and from rock-crystal, for which it may be mistaken, it 
is distinguished by being biaxial and by having a much higher 
specific gravity. The topaz becomes electric by heating, by 
friction or by pressure. Colourless limpid topazes are known in 
Brazil as pingos d'agoa, or " drops of water," whilst in England 
they pass in trade as " minas novas," from a locality in the 
state of Minas Geraes in Brazil." 

Coloured topazes usually present various shades of yellow, blue 
or brown. The pleochroism is fairly marked, the colour of the 
sherry-yellow crystals from Brazil being generally resolved by the 



dichroscope into a brownish-yellow and a rose-pink. The colour 
in many cases is unstable, and the brown topazes of Siberia are 
specially liable to suffer bleaching by exposure to sunlight. In 
1750 a Parisian jeweller named Dumelle discovered that the 
yellow Brazilian topaz becomes pink on exposure to a moderate 
heat, and this treatment has since been extensively applied, so 
that nearly all the pink topaz occurring in jewelry has been 
artificially heated. Such " burnt topaz " is often known as 
" Brazilian ruby," a name applied also to the natural red topaz, 
which, however, is excessively rare. " Brazilian sapphire " is 
the term sometimes given to blue topaz, but the colour is usually 
pale. The delicate green topaz has been incorrectly called 
aquamarine, which is a name applicable only to the sea-green 
beryl (q.v.). According to A. K. Coomaraswamy, yellow sapphire 
is often sold as topaz in Ceylon, where yellow topaz is unknown, 
whilst pink corundum is frequently called there " king topaz." 

The topaz is cut on a leaden wheel, and polished with tripoli. 
It is generally step-cut, or table-cut, but its beauty is best 
developed when in the form of a brilliant. Cut topazes of 
large size are known, and it is said that the great " Braganza 
diamond " of Portugal is probably a topaz. 

Topaz usually occurs in granitic and gneissose rocks, often in 
greisen, and is commonly associated with cassiterite, tourmaline and 
beryl. It seems to have been formed, in many cases, by pneumato- 
lytic action. In the west of England it is found in Cornwall, 
notably at St Michael's Mount and at Cligga Head near St Agnes. 
It occurs also in Lundy Island. The finest British topaz is found 
in the Cairngorm group of mountains in the central Highlands, 
especially at Ben a Buird. Rolled pebbles occur in the bed of the 
Avon in Banffshire. Beautiful, though small, crystals occur in 
the drusy cavities of the granite of the Mourne Mountains in 
Ireland. The famous ^ topaz-rock of the Schneckenstein, near 
Auerbach, in Saxony, yields pale yellow crystals, formerly cut for 
jewelry, and it is said that these do not become pink on heating. 
Fine topazes occur in Russia, at several localities in the Urals and 
in the Adun-chalon Mountains, near Nerchinsk, in Siberia. A very 
fine series from the Koksharov collection is in the British Museum. 
Beautiful crystals of topaz are found in Japan, especially at Taka- 
yama in the province of Mino, and at Tanokamiyama in Omi 
province. Ceylon and^Burma occasionally yield topazes. Brazil 
is a famous locality, the well-known sherry-yellow crystals coming 
from Ouro Preto, formerly called Villa Rica, the capital of Minas 
Geraes, where they occur in a kaolinitic matrix, resulting from the 
alteration of a mica-schist, which is regarded by Professor O. A. 
Derby as a metamorphosed igneous rock. Topaz occurs in the 
tin-driftsof New South Wales, especially in the New England 
district; it has been discovered in the Coolgardie goldfield, West 
Australia; and itis found also in the tinfields of Tasmania and on 
Flinders Island in Bass's Strait. Fine topaz has been worked 
near Pike's Peak in Colorado, and in San Diego county, California. 
The mineral occurs in rhyolite at Nathrop in Chaffee county and 
Chalk Mountain in Summit county, Colorado, and in trachyte 
near Sevier Lake, Utah. The occurrence of topaz in these volcanic 
rocks js very notable, and contrasts with its common occurrence 
in granites. It: is found in like manner in rhyolite at San Luis- 
Potosi in Mexico; and beautiful little limpid crystals accompany 
stream-tin at Durango. Common topaz occurs in coarse crystals 
at many localities. A columnar variety from the tin-districts of 
Saxony and Bohemia, and from Mt^ Bischoff in Tasmania, is. 
known aspycnite (irvKpfe, dense); whilst a coarse opaque topaz 
from granite near Falun, in Sweden, has been termed pyrophysa- 
lite (irOp, fire; 4>vaaa), to blow), in allusion to its behaviour when 
heated. 

11 Oriental topaz " is the name sometimes given to yellow corun- 
dum, a mineral readily distinguished from true topaz by superior 
hardness and density. Yellow and smoke-tinted quartz, or cairn- 
gorm, is often known as " Scotch topaz " or " Spanish topaz,'* 
according to its locality; but these, on the contrary, are inferior 
in^ hardness and density. The chief differences between the three 
minerals may be seen in the following table, in which they are 
arranged in order of hardness, density and refractivity: —

the Kansas river, in the east part of the state, about 60 m. W. of 
Kansas City. Pop. (1900), 33,608, of whom 3201 were foreign- 
born (including 702 Germans, 575 Swedes, 512 English, 407 
Russians, 320 Irish, &c.) and 4807 were negroes; (1910, census), 
43,684. It is served by the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe, the 
Chicago, Rock Island & Pacific, the Union Pacific and the 
Missouri Pacific railways. The city is regularly laid out on a 
fairly level prairie bench, considerably elevated above the river 
and about 890 ft. above sea-level. Among its prominent build- 
ings are the United States government building, the Capitol 
(erected 1 866-1 903 at a cost of $3,200,589 and one of the best 
state buildings in the country), the county court house, the 
public library (1882), an auditorium (with a seating capacity 
of about 5000), the Y.M.C.A. building, a memorial building, 
housing historical relics of the state, and Grace Church Cathedral 
(Protestant Episcopal). The city is the see of a Protestant 
Episcopal bishop. In the Capitol are the library (about 6000 
volumes) and natural history collections of the Kansas Academy 
of Science, and the library (30,000 books, 94,000 pamphlets and 
28, 500 manuscripts) and collections of the Kansas State Historical 
Society, which publishes Kansas Historical Collections (1875 
sqq.) and Biennial Reports (1879 sqq.). The city is the seat of 
Washburn (formerly Lincoln) College (1865), which took its 
present name in 1868 in honour of Ichabod Washburn of Wor- 
cester, Massachusetts, who gave it $25,000; in 1909 it had 783 
students (424 being women). Other educational establishments 
are the College of the Sisters of Bethany (Protestant Episcopal, 
1861), for women, and the Topeka Industrial and Educational 
Institute (1895), for negroes. In Topeka are the state insane 
asylum, Christ's Hospital (1894), the Jane C. Stormont Hospital 
and Training School for nurses (1895), the Santa Fe Railway 
Hospital, the Bethesda Hospital (1906) and the St Francis 
Hospital (1909). Topeka is an important manufacturing city. 
Its factory product was valued in 1905 at $14,448,869. Natural 
gas is piped from southern Kansas for manufacturing and 
domestic use. 

The first white settlement on the site of Topeka was made in 
1852, but the city really originated in 1854, when its- site was 
chosen by a party from Lawrence. It was from the first a free- 
state stronghold. More than one convention was held here in 
Territorial days, including that which framed the Topeka 
Constitution of 1855; and some of the meetings of the free-state 
legislature chosen under that document (see Kansas) were also 
held here. Topeka was made the temporary state capital under 
the Wyandotte Constitution, and became the permanent capital 
in 1861. It was first chartered by the pro-slavery Territorial 
legislature in 1857, but did not organize its government until 
1858 (see Lawrence). In 1881 it was chartered as a city of the 
first class. The first railway outlet, the Union Pacific, reached 
Eugene, now North Topeka, in 1865. The construction of the 
Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe was begun here in 1868, and its 
construction shops, of extreme importance to the city, were built 
here in 1878. In 1880, just after the great negro immigration to 
Kansas, the coloured population was 31 % of the total.

TOPELIUS, ZAKRIS [Zacharias] (1818-1898), Finnish 
author, was born at Kuddnas, near Nykarleby, on the 
1 4th of January 1 8 1 8 . He was the son of a doctor of 
the same name, who was distinguished as the earliest collector 
of Finnish folk-songs. Topelius became a student at Hel- 
singfors in 1833, was made professor in 1863 and received 
in succession all the academic distinctions open to him . 
Quite early in his career he began to distinguish himself 
as a lyric poet, with the three successive volumes of his 
Heather Blossoms (1845-1854). The earliest of his historical 
romances was The Duchess of Finland, published in 1850. 
He was also editor-in-chief of the Helsingfors Gazette from 
1841 to i860. In 1878 Topelius was allowed to withdraw from 
his professional duties, but this did not sever his connexion 
with the university; it gave him, however, more leisure for his 
abundant and various literary enterprises. Of all the multi- 
farious writings of Topelius, in prose and verse, that which has 



enjoyed the greatest popularity is his Tales of a Barber-Surgeon^ 
episodes of historical fiction from the days of Gustavus II. 
Adolphus to those of Gustavus III., treated in the manner of 
Sir Walter Scott; the five volumes of this work appeared at 
intervals between 1853 and 1867. Topelius attempted the 
drama also, with most success in his tragedy of Regina von 
Emmeritz (1854). Topelius aimed, with eminent but perhaps 
pathetic success, at the cultivation of a strong passion of 
patriotism in Finland. He died on the 13th of March 1898 
at Helsingfors. Topelius was an exceptionally happy writer 
for children, his best-known book being L&sning for barn* 
His abundant poetry is graceful and patriotic, but does not 
offer any features of great originality. (E. G.) 

TOPETE, JUAN BAUPTISTA (1821-1885), Spanish naval 
commander and politician, was born in Mexico on the 24th of 
May 1821. His father and grandfather were also Spanish, 
admirals. He entered the navy at the age of seventeen, cut out 
a Carlist vessel in 1839, became a midshipman at twenty-two, 
obtained the cross of naval merit for saving the life of a sailor in 
1841 and became a lieutenant in 1845. He served on the West 
Indian station for three years, and was engaged in repressing the 
slave trade hefore he was promoted frigate captain in 1857. He 
was chief of staff to the fleet during the Morocco War, 1859, after 
which he got the crosses of San Fernando and San Hermenegildo. 
Having been appointed chief of the Carrara arsenal at Cadiz, he 
was elected deputy and joined the Union Liberal of O'Donnell 
and Serrano. He was sent out to the Pacific in command of the 
frigate " Blanca," and was present at the bombardment of 
Valparaiso and Callao, where he was badly wounded, and in 
other engagements of the war between Chile and Peru. On his- 
return to Spain, Topete was made port captain at Cadiz, which 
enabled him to take the lead of the conspiracy in the fleet against 
the Bourbon monarchy. He sent the steamer " Buenaventura " 
to the Canary Isle for Serrano and the other exiles; and when 
Prim and Sagasta arrived from Gibraltar, the whole fleet under 
the influence of Topete took such an attitude that the people, 
garrison and authorities of Cadiz followed suit. Topete took 
part in all the acts of the revolutionary government, accepted the 
post of marine minister, was elected a member of the Cortes of 
1869, supported the pretensions of Montpensier, opposed the 
election of Amadeus, sat in several cabinets of that king's reign, 
was prosecuted by the federal republic of 1873 and again took 
charge of the marine under Serrano in 1874. After the Restora- 
tion Topete for some years held aloof, but finally accepted the 
presidency of a naval board in 1877, and sat in the Senate as a 
life peer until his death on the 29th of October 1885 at Madrid. 

TOPFFER, RODOLPHE (1799-1846), the inventor of pedes- 
trian journeys in Switzerland by schoolboys, was born at Geneva 
on the 31st of January 1799. His grandfather, a tailor, came 
about 1 760 from Schweinfurt (Bavaria) to settle in Geneva, while 
his father, Adam, was an artist. Rodolphe's literary education 
was rather desultory, as he intended to be an artist, like his father. 
But in 1819 his weak eyesight put an end to that intention, so 
he studied in Paris, intending to devote himself to the profession 
of schoolmaster. After passing some time in a private school in 
Geneva (1822-1824), he founded (1824) one of his own, after his 
marriage. It was in 1823 that he made his first foot journey 
in the Alps with his pupils, though this became his regular 
practice only from 1832 onwards. These Voyages en zigzag were 
described annually (1832-1843) in a series of lithographed volumes, 
with sketches by the author — the first printed edition appeared 
at Paris in 1844, and a second series (Nouveaux voyages en zig- 
zag) also at Paris in 1854. Both series have since passed through 
many editions. In 1832 he was named professor of belles-lettres 
at the university of Geneva, and held that chair till his death, 
on the 8th of June 1846. As early as 1830 he published an article 
in the Bibliothbque universelle of Geneva. It was followed by a 
number of tales, commencing with the Bibliothbque de mon oncle 
(1832), many of which were later collected (1841) into the well- 
known volume which bears the title of Nouvelles genevoises. 
He took some part (on the Conservative side) in local politics, 
and was (1841-1843) editor of the Courrier de Geneve, Among

his other works are an edition of Demosthenes (1824), and a 
volume of artistic studies, the Reflexions el menus propos oVun 
peinlre ginevois (1848).

TOPHET, or Topheth (n$n$), the name given in 2 Kings 
xxiii. 10; Jer. vii. 31, to a spot in the valley of Ben Hinnom near 
Jerusalem where the Hebrews in the time of Ahab and Manasseh 
offered children to Molech and other heathen gods. Josiah 
" defiled" it as part of his reforming activity, and it became a 
place for the bestowal and destruction of refuse, and a synonym 
for Gehenna (Isa. xxx. 33 ; Jer. vii. 3 2). 

The uncertain etymology of the word is discussed in the Ency, 
Bib., s.v. " Molech," §3, "Topheth." 

TOPIARY, a term in gardening or horticulture for the cutting 
and trimming of shrubs, such as cypress, box or yew, into regular 
and ornamental shapes. It is usually applied to the cutting of 
trees into urns, vases, birds and other fantastic shapes, which 
were common at the end of the 17th century and through 
the 1 8th, but it also embraces the more restrained art necessary 
for the laying out of a formal garden. Yew and holly trees cut 
into fantastic objects may still be seen in old-fashioned cottage 
or farmhouse gardens in England. The Lat. topiarius meant an 
ornamental or landscape gardener, and was formed from topia 
(Gr. T&iroSy place), a term specially employed for a formal kind of 
landscape painting used as a mural decoration in Roman houses. 

TOPLADY, AUGUSTUS MONTAGUE (1740-177S), Anglican 
divine, was born at Farnham, Surrey, and educated at- West- 
minster and Trinity College, Dublin. Although originally a 
follower of Wesley, he in 1758 adopted extreme Calvinist opinions. 
He was ordrined in 1762 and became vicar of Harpford with 
Fenn-Ottery, Devonshire, in 1766. In 1768 he exchanged to the 
living of Broadhembury, Devonshire. He is chiefly known as a 
writer of hymns and poems, including " Rock of Ages," and the 
collections entitled Poems on Sacred Subjects (Dublin, 1759) and 
Psalms and Hymns for Public and Private Worship (London, 
1776). His best prose work is the Historic Proof of the Doctrinal 
Calvinism of the Church of Engla?id (London, 1774). Some 
comments by Wesley upon Toplady's presentation of Calvinism 
led to a controversy which was carried on with much bitter- 
ness on both sides. Toplady wrote a venomous Letter to 
Mr Wesley (1770), and Wesley repeated his comments in The 
Consequence Proved (1771), whereupon Toplady replied with 
increased acridity in More Work for Mr Wesley (1772). From 
1775 to 1778, having obtained leave of non-residence at 
Broadhembury, he lived in London, and ministered at a 
Calvinist church in Orange Street. 

TOPOGRAPHY (Gr. tokos, place, yp&fciv, to write), a 
description of a town, district or locality, giving details of its 
geographical and architectural features. The tennis also applied 
in anatomy to the mapping out of the surface of the human 
body, either according to a division based on the organs or parts 
lying below certain regions, or on a superficial plotting out of 
the body by anatomical boundaries and landmarks. 

TORAN, the name in Hindustani (Skr. . tor ana, from tor, pass) 
of a sacred or honorific gateway in Buddhist architecture. Its 
typical form is a projecting cross-piece resting on two uprights 
or posts. It is made of wood or stone, and the cross-piece is 
generally of three bars placed one on the top of the other; both 
cross-piece and posts are usually sculptured. 

10RBERNITE (or cupro-uranite), a mineral which is one of the 
''uranium micas"; a hydrous uranium and copper phosphate, 
Cu(U02)2(P0 4 )2+i2H 2 0. Crystals are tetragonal and have the 
form of square plates, which are often very thin. There is a 
perfect micaceous cleavage parallel to the basal plane, and on 
this face the lustre is pearly. The bright grass-green colour 
is a characteristic feature of the mineral. The hardness is z\ 
and the specific gravity 3-5. The radio-activity of the mineral

is greater than that of some specimens of pitchblende. It was 
first observed in 1772 at Johanngeorgenstadt in Saxony, but the 
best examples are from Gunnisiake near Calstock and Redruth 
in Cornwall. The name torbenite is after Torbern Bergman: ■ 
chalcolite is a synonym. (L. J. S.) 

TORCELLO, an island of Venetia, Italy, in the lagoons about 
6 m. to the N.W. of Venice, belonging to the commune of Burano. 
It was a flourishing city in the early middle ages, but now has 
only a few houses and two interesting churches. The former 
cathedral of S. Maria was founded in the 7th century. The 
present building, a basilica with columns, dates from 864; the 
nave was restored in 1008, in which year the now ruined octagonal 
baptistery was built. It contains large mosaics of the 12th 
century, strongly under Byzantine influence; those on the west 
wall represent the Resurrection and Last Judgment. The 
seats for the priests are arranged round the semicircular apse, 
rising in steps with the bishop's throne in the centre — an arrange- 
ment unique in Italy. Close by is S. Fosca, a church of the 12th 
century, octagonal outside, with colonnades on ^vc sides and a 
rectangular interior intended for a dome which was never 
executed, beyond which is a three-apsed choir. In the local 
museum are four Mycenaean vases, one found in the island and 
another on the adjacent island of Mazzorbo, proving direct 
intercourse with the Aegean Sea in prehistoric times. 

SeeR. M.Dawkins, in Journal of Hellenic Studies (1904), xxiv. 125. 

TORCH (O. Fr. torche, from Med. Lat. tortia, derived from 
tortus, twisted, torquere, to twist), a light or illuminant that can 
be carried in the hand, made of twisted tow, hemp or other 
inflammable substance. Torches or " links " were, till the general 
introduction of street lighting, necessary adjuncts for passengers 
on foot or in carriages in towns at night, and many of the older 
houses in London and elsewhere still retain the iron stands 
outside their doors, in which the torches might be placed. 

TORCHERE, a candelabrum mounted upon a tall stand of 
wood or metal, usually with two or three lights. When it 
was first introduced in France towards the end of the 17th 
century the torchere mounted one candle only, and when the 
number was doubled or tripled the improvement was regarded 
almost as a revolution in the lighting of large rooms. 

TORDENSKJOLD, PEDER (1601-1720), eminent Danish 
naval hero, the tenth child of alderman Jan Wessel of Bergen, in 
Norway, was born at Trondhjem on the 28th of October 1691. 
Wessel was a wild unruly lad who gave his pious parents much 
trouble. Finally he ran away from them by hiding in a ship 
bound for Copenhagen, where the king's chaplain Dr Peder Jes- 
persen took pity on the friendless lad, gratified his love for the 
sea by sending him on a voyage to the West Indies, and finally 
procured him a vacant cadetship. After further voyages, 
this time to the East Indies, Wessel was, on the 7 th of July 
171 1, appointed 2nd lieutenant in the royal marine and shortly 
afterwards became the captain of a little 4-gun sloop " Ormen" 
(The Serpent), in which he cruised about the Swedish coast 
and picked up much useful information about the enemy. 
In June 1712 he was promoted to a 20-gun frigate, against 
the advice of the Danish admiralty, which pronounced him to 
be too flighty and unstable for such a command. His dis- 
criminating patron was the Norwegian admiral Lovendal, 
who was the first to recognize the young man's ability as a 
naval officer. At this period Wessel was already renowned for 
two things: the audacity with which he attacked any Swedish 
vessels he came across regardless of odds, and his unique seaman- 
ship, which always enabled him to escape capture. The Great 
Northern War had now entered upon its later stage, when Sweden, 
beset on every side by foes, employed her fleet principally to 
transport troops and stores to her distressed German provinces. 
The audacity of Wessel impeded her at every point. He was 
continually snapping up transports, dashing into the fjords where 
her vessels lay concealed, and holding up her detached frigates. 
In July 1 7 14 he encountered a frigate which had been equipped 
in England for the Swedes and was on its way to Gothenburg 
under the command of an English captain. Wessel instantly 



TOREADOR— TORENO 



5i 






attacked her but in the English captain he met his match. 
The combat lasted all day, was interrupted by nightfall, and 
renewed again indecisively the following morning. Wessel's 
free and easy ways procured him many enemies in the Danish 
navy. He was accused of unnecessarily endangering his 
majesty's war-ships in the affairs with the frigate and he was 
brought before a court-martial. But the spirit with which 
he defended himself and the contempt he poured on his less 
courageous comrades took the fancy of King Frederick IV., 
who cancelled the proceedings and raised Wessel to the rank of 
captain. When in the course of 171 5 the return of Charles XII. 
from Turkey to Stralsund put a new life into the jaded and 
dispirited Swedish forces, Wessel distinguished himself in 
numerous engagements off the Pomeranian coast and did the 
enemy infinite damage by cutting out their frigates and destroy- 
ing their transports. On returning to Denmark in the beginning 
of 1716 he was ennobled under the title of " Tordenskjold " 
(Thundershield). When in the course of 1716 Charles XII. 
invaded Norway and sat down before the fortress of Fredrik- 
shald, Tordenskjold compelled him to raise the siege and 
retire to Sweden by pouncing upon the Swedish transport 
fleet laden with ammunition and other military stores which 
rode at anchor in the narrow and dangerous strait of Dynekil, 
utterly destroying the Swedish fleet with little damage to him- 
self. For this, his greatest exploit, he was promoted to the rank 
of commander, but at the same time incurred the enmity of 
his superior officer Admiral Gabel, whom he had omitted to 
take into his confidence on the occasion. Tordenskjold's first 
important command was the squadron with which he was 
entrusted in the beginning of 171 7 for the purpose of destroying 
the Swedish Gothenburg squadron which interrupted the com- 
munications between Denmark and Norway. Owing to the 
disloyalty of certain of his officers who resented serving under 
the young adventurer, Tordenskjold failed to do all that was 
expected of him. His enemies were not slow to take advantage 
of his partial failure. The old charge of criminal recklessness 
was revived against him at a second court-martial before which 
he was summoned in 1718; but his old patron Admiral U. C. 
Gyldenlove again intervened energetically in his behalf and 
the charge was quashed. In December 1718 Tordenskjold 
brought to Frederick IV. the welcome news of the death of 
Charles XII. and was made a rear-admiral for his pains. Tor- 
denskjold's last feat of arms was his capture of the Swedish 
fortress of Marstrand, when he partially destroyed and partially 
captured the Gothenburg squadron which had so long eluded him. 
He was rewarded with the rank of vice-admiral. Tordenskjold 
did not long survive the termination of the war. On the 20th 
of November 1720 he was killed in a duel with a Livonian 
colonel, Jakob Axel Stael von Holstein. Although, Dynekil 
excepted, Tordenskjold ? s victories were of far less importance 
than Sehested's at Stralsund and Gyldenlove's at Rugen, he is 
certainly, after Charles XII., the most heroic figure of the Great 
Northern War. His courage was fully equal to the courage 
of " The Lion of the North," hut he lacked that absolute self- 
command which gives to the bravery of Charles XII. its peculiar, 
almost superhuman, character.

TORELL, OTTO MARTIN (1828-1900), Swedish geologist, 
was born in Varberg on the 5th of June 1828. He was edu- 
cated at Lund for the medical profession, but became interested 
in zoological and geological studies, and being of independent 
means he devoted himself to science. He gave his attention 
first especially to the invertebrate fauna and the physical 
changes of pleistocene and recent times. He studied the 
glacial phenomena of Switzerland, Spitzbergen and Green- 
land, making two Arctic expeditions in company with A. E. 
Nordenskiold. In 1866 he became professor of zoology and 
geology in the University at Lund, and in 1871 he was appointed 



chief of the Swedish Geological Survey. In the latter capacity 
he laboured until 1897. His published contributions, though of 
much interest and importance, were not large, but his influence 
in promoting a knowledge of geology in Sweden was of great 
service. His Arctic experiences enabled him to interpret 
the method of origin of the drift deposits in northern Europe, 
and to show that they were largely of glacial or fluvio-glacial 
origin. In the English drifts he recognized many houlders of 
Scandinavian origin. He died on the nth of September 1900. 

His publications include: Bidrag till Spitzbergens molluskfauna 
(1859); and memoirs to accompany several sheets of the Geological 
Survey map of Sweden.

TORENO, JOSfi MARIA QUIEPO DE LLANO RUIZ DE 

SARAVIA, Count of (1 786-1843), Spanish politician and his- 
torian, was born at Oviedo on the 25th of November 1786. His 
family was wealthy and belonged to the most ancient nobility 
of Asturias. His mother, Dominga Ruiz de Saravia, had 
property in the province of Cuenca. The son received a better 
education in classics, mathematics and modern languages 
than was usual at that time. The young viscount of Matarrosa, 
the title he bore in his father's lifetime, was introduced 
to the writings of Voltaire and Rousseau by the abbot, 
of the Benedictine house of Monserrat in Madrid. He was 
present at Madrid when the city rose against Murat on the 2nd 
of May 1808, and took part in the struggle which was the 
beginning of the Peninsular War. From Madrid he escaped 
to Asturias, and on the 30th of May he embarked in a Jersey 
privateer at Gijon, with other delegates, in order to ask for the 
help of England against the French. The deputation was 
enthusiastically received in London. By the 30th of December 
he was back in Asturias, his father having died in the interval. 
During the Peninsular War he saw some service in the first 
occupation of Asturias by the French, but he was mainly occu- 
pied by his duties as a member of the Cortes. In 1809 he was at 
Seville, where one of his uncles was a member of the central 
Junta. In the following year he was a leader of the party which 
compelled the Regency to summon the Cortes — to which he was 
elected by Asturias early in 1811 though he wanted some months 
of the legal age of twenty-five. His election was opposed by 
some of his own relatives who did not share his advanced opinions, 
but it was ratified by the Cortes. Toreno was conspicuous 
among the well-meaning men who framed the constitution of 
181 2, which was made as if it was meant for some imaginary 
republic and not for Catholic and monarchical Spain. When 
Ferdinand VII. returned from prison in France in 1814 Toreno 
foresaw a reaction, and put himself out of reach of the king. 
He was the more an object of suspicion because his brother- 
in-law, Porlier, perished in a wild attempt to support the con- 
stitution by force. Toreno remained in exile till the outbreak 
of the revolution of 1820. Between that year and 1823 he was 
in Spain serving in the restored Cortes, and experience had 
abated his radical ardour. When the French intervened in 1823 
Toreno had again to go into exile, and remained abroad till the 
king published the amnesty of the 15th of October 1832. He 
returned home in July 1833, but remained on his estates till 
the king's death on the 29th of September. As hereditary 
standard bearer of Asturias (Alferez Mayor) it fell to him to 
proclaim the young queen, Isabella II. In 1834 his now 
moderate opinions pointed him out to the queen regent, Maria 
Christina, as a useful man for office. In June 1834 he was 
minister of finance, and became prime minister on the 7th of 
June. His tenure of the premiership lasted only till the 14th of 
September of the same year, when the regent's attempt to retain 
a practically despotic government under a thin constitutional 
veil broke down. 'The greater part of the remainder of his 
life was spent in voluntary exile, and he died in Paris on the 
1 6th of September 1843. As a politician he felt the need for a 
revision of the worn out despotism which ruled till 1808, but he 
was destitute of any real political capacity. Toreno is chiefly 
remembered as the author of the History of the Rising, War

and Revolution of Spain, which he began between 1823 and 
1832 and published in 1836-1838 in Paris. As a work of military 
criticism it is not of high value, and Toreno was prejudiced in 
favour of his colleagues of the Cortes, whose errors and ex- 
cesses he shared in and excused. The book is, however, written 
in excellent Castilian, and was compiled with industry. It is 
worth consulting as an illustration of the time in which the author 
lived, as a patriotic Spanish view of the war, and for the pro- 
minence it gives to the political side of the Peninsular War, 
which he justly treated as a revolution. 

A biography by Don Antonio de Cueto is prefixed to the reprint 
of the Levantamtento guerra y revolution de Espafia, in vol. Ixiv.

TORENO, QUEIPO DE LLANO Y GAYOSO DE, Count 
(1840-1800), Spanish politician, son of the preceding,* was 
born in Madrid in 1840. He was educated at the Madrid 
Institute and University, entered parliament in 1864 as [a 
Moderado, and sat in all the Cortes of Queen Isabella's reign 
as a deputy for his ancestral province, Asturias. Loyal to the 
Bourbons all through the revolution, he nevertheless became a 
deputy in the Cortes of 1871-1873, and founded an Alphonsist 
paper, El Tiempo, in 1873. When the Restoration took place, 
its first cabinet made Count de Toreno mayor of the capital, 
and in 1875 minister of public works, in which capacity he im- 
proved the public libraries, museums, academies and archives, 
and caused many important works to be published, includ- 
ing the Cartas de Indias. In 1879 he became minister for 
foreign affairs, in 1880 president of the House of Deputies, in 
1884 again governor of Madrid, and in 1885 again president 
of the House of Deputies. During the reign of Alphonso XII. 
and the first years of the regency of Queen Christina Count de 
Toreno was one of the most prominent Conservative leaders, 
and was often consulted by the Crown. He died on the 31st 
of January 1890. He was a patron of the turf, and established 
a race-course in Madrid, where the first races took place in the 
reign of Alphonso XII. 

TORGAU, a town of Germany, in the Prussian province of 
Saxony, situated on the left bank of the Elbe, 30 m. N.E. of 
Leipzig and 26 m. S.E. of Wittenberg by rail. Pop. (1905), 
12,299. Its most conspicuous building is the Schloss Hartenf els, 
on an island in the Elbe, which was built, or at least was finished, 
by the elector of Saxony, John Frederick the Magnanimous. 
This castle, which is now used as a barracks, is one of the largest 
Renaissance buildings in Germany. It was for some time the 
residence of the electors of Saxony and contains a chapel con- 
secrated by Martin Luther. The town hall, a 16th-century 
building, houses a collection of Saxon antiquities. Torgau 
•has two Evangelical churches and a Roman Catholic church. 
One of the former, the Stadt Kirche, contains paintings by 
Lucas Cranach and the tomb of Catherine von Bora, the wife of 
Luther. The chief industries of the town are the manufacture 
of gloves, carriages, agricultural machinery, beer and bricks; 
there is a trade in grain both on the Elbe and by rail. The 
fortifications, begun in 1807 by order of Napoleon, were dis- 
mantled in 1889-1891. In the vicinity is the royal stud farm of 
Graditz. 

Torgau is said to have existed as the capital of a distinct 
principality in the time of the German king Henry I., but early 
in the 14th century it was in the possession of the margraves 
of Meissen and later of the electors of Saxony, who frequently 
resided here. The town came into prominence at the time of 
the Reformation. In 1526 John, elector of Saxony, Philip, 
landgrave of Hesse, and other Protestant princes formed a 
league against the Roman Catholics, and the Torgau articles, 
drawn up here by Luther and his friends in 1530, were the 
basis of the confession of Augsburg. Torgau is particularly 
celebrated as the scene of a battle fought on the 3rd of November 
1760, when Frederick the Great defeated the Austrians (see 
Seven Years' War). In January 1814 Torgau was taken by 
the Germans after a siege of three months and it was formally 
ceded to Prussia in 1815.

TORNADO (Span., tomada, a turning about, cf. " turn "), 
a local whirlwind of extreme violence, usually formed within a 
thunderstorm. In appearance it consists of a funnel-shaped 
cloud, depending from the mass of storm-cloud above, and when 
fully developed tapering downwards to the earth. Besides its 
whirling motion, a tornado has an advancing movement of 
from 20 to 40 m. an hour — and along its own narrow path it 
carries destruction. Its duration is usually from half an hour 
to an hour. Tornadoes are most common in America, espe- 
cially in the Mississippi Valley and the Southern states; in Europe 
and elsewhere they are comparatively rare. Owing to their 
association with thunderstorms they generally occur in warm 
weather. A tornado is the result of a condition of local in- 
stability in the atmosphere, originating high above the earth. 
A current of air is induced to ascend with a rapid spiral motion 
round a central core of low pressure. The moisture in the 
ascending air is condensed by cooling both as it ascends and as 
it expands into the low-pressure core. The cloud-funnel appears 
to grow downwards because the moisture in the air is condensed 
more rapidly than the air itself, following a spiral course, ascends. 

TORO, a town of Spain, in the province of Zamora, on the 
right bank of the river Duero (Douro), and on the Zamora- 
Medina del Campo railway. Pop. (1900), 8379. Toro is an 
ancient fortified town, with picturesque narrow streets, among 
which are many medieval churches, convents and palaces, 
besides modern schools and public buildings. A fine bridge 
of twenty-two arches spans the river. The cathedral church 
is Romanesque; it dates from the 12th century but has been 
partially restored. The palace of the marquesses of Santa 
Cruz was the meeting place of the Cortes of 1371, 1442 and 
1505, which made Toro and its code of laws celebrated. Toro 
is first mentioned in documents of the 10th century. It played 
an important part in the development of the kingdoms of Leon 
and Castile and in the reconquest of Spain from the Moors. 

TORONTO, the capital of the province of Ontario, and the 
second largest city in the Dominion of Canada, situated on 
the northern shore of Lake Ontario, almost due north from the 
mouth of the Niagara river. It lies on a plateau gradually 
ascending from the lake shore to an altitude of 220 ft., and 
covers an area of nearly 20 sq. m. The river Don flows 
through the eastern part of the city, and the river Humber 
forms its western limit. The fine bay in front of the city, 
affording a safe and commodious harbour, is formed by an 
island stretching along the south of it. The city is well laid 
out for the most part, the streets crossing each other at right 
angles; Yonge Street, the chief artery, running north from the 
bay, was constructed as a military road in* 1796, and extends 
under the same name for upwards of 30 m. to Lake Simcoe. It 
constitutes the dividing line of the city, the cross streets being 
called east or west according to the side of it they are on. 

Toronto is the seat of government for the province, and 
contains the parliament buildings, the lieutenant-governor's 
residence, the courts of law and the educational departmental 
buildings. The parliament buildings are situated in Queen's 
Park, almost in the centre of [the city, and are an imposing 
structure of red sandstone in the neo-Greek style built at great 
cost. They are shortly to be enlarged, as the needs of the 
province have outgrown them. A little distance to the west 
stand the university buildings, the central one being a splendid 
piece of architecture in the Norman style. Stretching in a semi- 
circle round the broad campus are the library, the medical 
building, the biology building and museum, the school of practical 
science, the geology and chemistry buildings and the convoca- 
tion hall, their architecture varying very greatly, beauty having 
been sacrificed to more practical considerations; the magnetic 
observatory is also in the grounds, but is overshadowed by some 
of the more recent erections. It is one of the meteorological

stations established by the British government on the recom- 
mendation of the Royal Society in 1840 and is now maintained 
by the Dominion government. The university of Toronto, 
for the support of which the province is responsible, includes 
faculties of arts, science and medicine, in the teaching of which 
it is strictly secular. But near at hand and in full affiliation 
with the university are Victoria College (Methodist), Wycliffe 
College (Anglican), Knox College (Presbyterian) and St Michael's 
College (Roman Catholic), wherein courses in divinity are given 
and degrees conferred. Victoria College, likewise, provides a 
course in arts, but none in science. Trinity College (Anglican), 
though some distance away, is also affiliated with the univer- 
sity, and her students enjoy its full advantages. Besides the 
university, Toronto is remarkably rich in educational institu- 
tions. Upper Canada College, founded in 1829, in many respects 
resembles one of the English public schools. It has over 300 
students. St Andrew's College, also for boys, is a more recent 
establishment, and has about the same number of pupils. 
There are three large collegiate institutes, having some 300 to 
600 pupils each, and in addition a number of schools for girls, 
such as Havergal College and Westminster College. Osgoode 
Hall, a stately structure in the heart of the city, houses the 
higher courts of law and appeal, and also a nourishing law school. 
The city hall and court-house is one of the finest civic build- 
ings in North America. It is in the Romanesque style, and 
accommodates all the civic offices, the board of education, the 
police and county courts, &c. Many of the churches are worthy 
examples of good architecture. 

Toronto is essentially a residential city. The houses of the 
better class stand separate, not in long rows, and have about 
them ample lawns and abundant trees. It is consequently a 
widespread city, the length from east to west approximating 
ten miles. An electric railway system provides means of com- 
munication. There are many parks, ranging in size from 
Carlton Park of one acre to High Park (375 acres) and Island 
Park (389), the latter being across the harbour and constitut- 
ing the favourite resort of the people during the summer. In 
Exhibition Park there is held annually an industrial and agri- 
cultural exhibition that has grown to great magnitude. It lasts 
a fortnight in late summer. It is a municipal enterprise and 
the profits belong to the city. 

The population in 1907, as shown by the police census, 
exceeded 300,000. The government of the city is vested in a 
council consisting of the mayor and four controllers elected 
annually and eighteen aldermen (three from each of the six wards 
into which the city is divided). The council as a whole is the 
legislative body, while the board of control is the executive 
body, and as such is responsible for the supervision of all matters 
of finance, the appointment of officials, the carrying on of 
public works, and the general administration of the affairs of 
the city, except the departments of education and of police, 
the first being under the control of the board of education, 
elected annually by the citizens, and the latter under the 
board of police commissioners, consisting of the mayor, the 
county judge and the police magistrate. 

Toronto is one of the chief manufacturing centres of the 
dominion; agricultural machinery, automobiles, bicycles, cotton 
goods, engines, furniture, foundry products, flour, smoked meats, 
tobacco, jewelry, &c, are flourishing industries, and the list is 
constantly extending. The situation of the city is favourable 
to commerce, and the largest vessels on the lakes can use its 
harbour. It is the outlet of a rich and extensive agricultural 
district, and throughout the season of navigation lines of steamers 
ply between Toronto and the other lake ports on both the 
Canadian and American sides, the route of some of them 
extending from Montreal to Port Arthur on Lake Superior. 
Railway communication is complete, three great trunk lines 
making the city a terminal point, viz. the Grand Trunk, the 
Canadian Pacific and the Canadian Northern. 

As a financial centre Toronto has made remarkable advance. 
The transactions on the stock exchange rival those of Montreal. 
The Bank of Commerce has its headquarters here, as have also 



the Bank of Nova Scotia, the Bank of Toronto, the Standard 
Traders, Imperial, Sovereign, Dominion, Crown, United Empire, 
Sterling and other banks. 

The name of the city is of Indian origin, meaning "a place of 
meeting," the site in the days before the coming of the white 
man being an established rendezvous among the neighbouring 
Indian tribes. It first appears in history in 1749 as a centre of 
trade when the French built a small fort and started a trading 
establishment called Fort Rouille. Before long, however, 
British traders came up from the south and entered into active 
rivalry with the French, and in 1793 the fort was burned by 
the latter to prevent its occupation by their foes. A year later 
Governor Simcoe transferred the seat of government of the new 
province of Upper Canada from the town of Newark at the 
mouth of the Niagara River to Toronto, giving the new capital 
the rtame of York, in honour of the second son of George III. 
Under its new name it made slow progress as the surrounding 
country was cleared and settled. The entrance to the harbour 
was guarded by two blockhouses; provision was made for 
barracks and garrison stores; buildings were erected for the 
legislature; and there the members of parliament, summoned 
by royal proclamation to "meet us in our provincial parliament 
in our town of York," assembled on the 1st of June 1797. 
Sixteen years later the population numbered only 456. The 
town was twice sacked in the war of 181 2. General Dearborn 
captured it at the head of a force of upwards of 2000. On their 
advance to the outworks of the garrison the magazine of the 
fort exploded, whether by -accident or design, killing many of 
the invaders. The halls of legislature and other buildings were 
burnt and the town pillaged. On the restoration of peace the 
work of creating a capital for Upper Canada had wellnigh to 
begin anew. The organization of Upper Canada College in 
1830, with a staff of teachers nearly all graduates of Cambridge, 
gave a great impetus to the city and province. In 1834 the 
population of York numbered fully 10,000; and an act of the 
provincial legislature conferred on it 'a charter of incorporation, 
with a mayor, aldermen and councilmen. Under this charter 
it was constituted a city with the name of Toronto. Since 
that time the progress of the city has been rapid and substantial, 
the population doubling every twenty years. In 1885 the 
total assessment was $69,000,000; in 1895 $146,000,000 and in 
1906 $167,411,000, the rate of taxation being 18^ mills. 

TORPEDO. In 1805 Robert Fulton demonstrated a new 
method of destroying ships by exploding a large charge of 
gunpowder against the hull under water. No doubt then 
remained as to the effectiveness of this form of attack when 
successfully applied; it was the difficulty of getting the torpedo, 
as it was called, to the required position which for many years 
retarded its progress as a practical weapon of naval warfare. 
Attempts were first made to bring the explosive in contact with 
the vessel by allowing it to drift down to her by the action of 
tide or current, and afterwards to fix it against her from some 
form of diving boat, but successive failures led to its restriction 
for a considerable period to the submarine mine (?.v.) in which 
the explosive is stationary and takes effect only when the ship 
itself moves over or strikes the charge. Used in this way, it 
is an excellent deterrent to hostile warships forcing a harbour. 

Spar or Outrigger Torpedo. — The limitations attached to the 
employment of submarine mines, except for coast defence, 
revived the idea of taking the torpedo to the ship instead of 
waiting for the latter to gain some exact point which she might 
very possibly avoid. This first took practical shape in the spar 
or outrigger torpedo. This consisted of a charge of explosive, 
at the end of a long pole projecting from the bow of a boat, 
the pole being run out and immersed on arriving near the object. 
Directly the charge came in contact with the hull of the ship it 
was exploded by an electric battery in the boat. If the boat 
was not discovered and disabled while approaching, the chances 
were favourable to success and escape afterwards. Against a 
vigilant enemy it was doubtless a forlorn hope, but to brave 
men the venture offered considerable attractions. 

Frequent use of this spar or outrigger torpedo was made during 



54 



TORPEDO 



the American Civil War. A notable instance was the destruction 
of the Confederate ironclad " Albemarle " at the end of October 
1864. On this mission Lieut. Cushing took a steam launch 
equipped with an outrigger torpedo up the Roanoke River, in 
which lay the " Albemarle." On arriving near the ship Cushing 
found her surrounded by logs, but pushing his boat over them, 
he immersed the spar and exploded his charge in contact with 
the " Albemarle " under a heavy fire. Ship and launch sank 
together, but the gallant officer jumped overboard, swam away 
and escaped. Submerged boats were also used for similar 
service, but usually went to the bottom with their crews. 
During the war between France and China in 1884 the "Yang 
Woo " was attacked and destroyed by an outrigger torpedo. 

Locomotive Torpedoes. — Though the spar torpedo had scored 
some successes, it was mainly because the means of defence 
against it at that time were inefficient. The ship trusted solely 
to her heavy gun and rifle fire to repel the attack. The noise, 
smoke, and difficulty of hitting a small object at night with a 
piece that could probably be discharged but once before the boat 
arrived, while rifle bullets would not stop its advance, favoured 
the attack. When a number of small guns and electric lights 
were added to a ship's equipment, success with an outrigger 
torpedo became nearly, if not entirely, impossible. Attention 
was then turned in the direction of giving motion to the torpedo 
and steering it to the required point by electric wires worked 
from the shore or from another vessel; or, dispensing with any 
such connection, of devising a torpedo which would travel under 
water in a given direction by means of self-contained motive 
power and machinery. Of the former type are the Lay, Sims- 
Edison and Brennan torpedoes. The first two — electrically 
steered by a wire which trails behind the torpedo — have in- 
sufficient speed to be of practical value, and are no longer used. 
The Brennan torpedo, carrying a charge of explosive, travels 
under water and is propelled by unwinding two drums or 
reels of fine steel wire within the torpedo. The rotation of 
these reels is communicated to the propellers, causing the 
torpedo to advance. The ends of the wires are connected 
to an engine on shore to give rapid unwinding and 
increased speed to the torpedo. It is steered by vary- 
ing the speed of unwinding the two wires. This tor- 
pedo was adopted by the British war office for harbour 
defence and the protection of narrow channels. 

Uncontrolled Torpedoes. — The objection of naval 
officers to have any form of torpedo connected by wire 
to their ship during an action, impeding her free move- 
ment, liahle to get entangled in her propellers and 
perhaps exploding where not desired— disadvantages 
which led them to discard the Harvey towing torpedo 
many years ago — has hitherto prevented any navy from 
adopting a controlled torpedo for its sea-going fleet. The 
last quarter of the 19th century saw, however, great 
advances in the equipment of ships with locomotive torpedoes of 
the uncontrolled type. The Howell may be briefly described, 
as it has a special feature of some interest. Motive power is 
provided by causing a heavy steel fly-wheel inside the torpedo 
to revolve with great velocity. This is effected by a small special 
engine outside operating on the axle. When sufficiently spun 
up, the axle of the flywheel is connected with the propeller 
shafts and screws which drive the torpedo, so that on entering 
the water it is driven ahead and continues its course until the 
power stored up in the flywheel is exhausted. Now when a 
torpedo is discharged into the sea from a ship in motion, it has 
a tendency to deflect owing to the action of the passing water. 
The angle of deflexion will vary according to the speed of the 
ship, and is also affected by other causes, such as the position 
in the ship from which the torpedo is discharged, and its own 
angle with the line of keel. Hence arise inaccuracies of shooting; 
but these do not occur with this torpedo, for the motion of the 
flywheel, acting as a gyroscope — the principle of which applied 
to the Whitehead torpedo is described later— keeps this torpedo 
on a straight course. This advantage, combined with simplicity 
in construction, induced the American naval authorities at one 



time to contemplate equipping their fleet with this torpedo*, for 
they had not, up to within a few years ago, adopted any loco- 
motive torpedo. A great improvement in the torpedo devised 
by Mr Whitehead led them, however, definitely to prefer the 
latter and to discontinue the further development of the Howell 
system. 

The Whitehead torpedo is a steel fish-shaped body which 
travels under water at a high rate of speed, being propelled by 
two screws driven by compressed air. It carries a large charge 
of explosive which is ignited on the torpedo striking any hard 
substance, such as the hull of a ship. The body is divided into 
three parts. The foremost portion or head contains the explo- 
sive — usually wet gun-cotton — with dry primer and mechanical 
igniting arrangement; the centre portion is the air chamber 
or reservoir, while the remaining part or tail carries the engines, 
rudders, and propellers besides the apparatus for controlling 
depth and direction. This portion also gives buoyancy to the 
torpedo. 

When the torpedo is projected from a ship or boat into the 
water a lever is thrown back, admitting air into the engines 
causing the propellers to revolve and drive the torpedo ahead. 
It is desirable that a certain depth under water should be main- 
tained. An explosion on the surface would be deprived of the 
greater part of its effect, for most of the gas generated would 
escape into the air. Immersed, the water above confines the 
liherated gas and compels it to exert all its energy against the 
bottom of the ship. It is also necessary to correct the tendency 
to rise that is due to the torpedo getting lighter as the air is 
used up, for compressed air has an appreciable weight. This 
is effected by an ingenious apparatus long maintained secret. 
The general principle is to utilize the pressures due to different 
depths of water to actuate horizontal rudders, so that the 
torpedo is automatically directed upwards or downwards as 
its tendency is to sink or rise. 

The efficiency of such a torpedo compared with all previous types 
was clearly manifest when it was brought before the maritime 
states by the inventor, Whitehead, and it was almost universally 
adopted. The principal defect was want of speed — which at first

did not exceed 10 knots an hour — but by the application of Brother- 
hood's 3-cylindcr engine the speed was increased to 18 knots — 
a great advance. From that time continuous improvements have 
resulted in speeds of 30 knots and upwards for a short range being 
obtained. For some years a torpedo 14 ft. long and 14 in. in 
diameter was considered large enough, though it had a very limited 
effective range. For a longer range a larger weapon must be 
employed capable of carrying a greater supply of air. To obtain 
this, torpedoes of 18 in. diameter, involving increased length and 
weight, have for some time been constructed, and have taken the 
place of the smaller torpedo in the equipment of warships. This 
advance in dimensions has not only given a faster and steadier 
torpedo, but enabled such a heavy charge of gun-cotton to be 
carried that its explosion against any portion of a ship would inevit- 
ably either sink or disable her. The dimensions, shape, &c, of the 14- 
and 18-in. torpedoes are shown in fig. 1. A limited range was 
still imposed by the uncertainty of its course under water. The 
speed of the ship from which it was discharged, the angle with her 
keel at which it entered the water, and the varying velocity of 
impulse, tended to error of flight, such error being magnified the 
farther the path of the torpedo was prolonged. Hence 800 yds. 
was formerly considered the limit of distance within which the 
torpedo should be discharged at sea against an object from a ship 
in motion. 

In these circumstances, though improvements in the manufacture 
of steel and engines allowed of torpedoes.of far longer range being

made (the fastest torpedo up to 1898 having a speed of 29 knots 
for 800 yds.) 1 it was of no advantage to make them, as they could 
not be depended upon to run in a straight line from a stationary 
point for more than 800 yds., while from a ship in motion good 
practice could only be ensured at a reduced range. It was obvious, 
therefore, that to increase the effective range of the torpedo, these 
errors of direction must be overcome by some automatic steering 
arrangement. Several inventors turned their attention to the 
subject, nearly all of whom proposed to utilize the principle of the 
gyroscope for the purpose. The first which gave any satisfactory 
results was an apparatus devised by Ludwig Obry — an engineer 
in Austria — and tried by the Italian government about 1896. 
These trials demonstrated the feasibility of accurately and auto- 
matically steering a torpedo in a direct line by this means. Messrs 
Whitehead & Co., of Fiume, then acauired the invention, and after 
exhaustive experiments produced the apparatus which is now 
fitted to every torpedo made. It is based on the principle that 
a body revolving on a free axis tends to preserve its plane of rotation. 
A gyroscope with plane of rotation parallel to the vertical axis of 
the torpedo will have an angular motion if the torpedo is diverted 
from its original course. This angular motion is employed to actuate 
the steering mechanism by operating an air motor connected 
with the rudders, and keeping the torpedo in the line of discharge. 
The apparatus consists of a flywheel caused to rotate by a spring, 
the barrel on which the latter is wound having a segmental wheel 
which gears into a toothed pinion spindle of the flywheel. Owing 
to the diameter of the segment being much greater than the pinion, 
a rapid rotatory motion is imparted. The^ springes wound up by a 
key from outside the torpedo, and kept in tension until the pro- 
jectile is discharged, when the spring is released by the air lever 
being thrown back, which admits air to the engine; the gyroscope 
is then freed and set in motion with its plane in^the plane of the 
vertical axis of the torpedo as it was in the launching tube. 

Assuming now that the course of the torpedo is diverted by any 
cause, its axis will move or perform a certain angular motion with 
regard to the plane of the flywheel, which will have the same 
result as if we consider the conditions reversed, i.e. as if the plane 
of rotation of the flywheel were altered and that of the axis of the 
torpedo remained the same. ^ The axis of the flywheel performs 
a relative angular motion which it imparts to a crank actuating 
a servo-motor worked by compressed air, and connected with the 
rudders of the torpedo, moving them in the opposite direction 
to that in_ which the torpedo was diverted from its original course. 
Thus all inaccuracies of flight due to errors of adjustment, mis- 
calculation of deflexion, or even damage to some part, are elimin- 
ated. As long^ as the gyroscope is in good order the torpedo is 
bound to run in the line it was pointing when the flywheel was 
started. It is placed in the after-body of the torpedo, as indicated 
in fig. 2. 



limited by the strength of the enginesand other parts. Improve- 
ments in stee^ manufacture have permitted the use of much higher 
pressures of air and the construction of air-chambers able to with- 
stand the pressure of 2000 tb to the sq. in. with the same weight of 
air-chamber. This has enabled increased range without reduction 
in speed to be attained, or ^ conversely , increased speed at shorter 
ranges. By improvement in the engines which are now of the 
Brotherhood 4-cylinder central crank type further gains have 
been effected. 

Having reached the limit of pressure and endurance of air- 
chambers with present materials without undue increase of weight, 
the designer had to seek additional energy in another direction. 
Now the energy obtainable from a given weight of compressed air 
is dependent upon the volume of air available at the working 
pressure of the engines. At a constant pressure this volume of 
air is proportionate to its absolute temperature. If then the air 
be stored cold and highly heated before delivery to the engine 
the available energy from a given weight will be greatly increased. 
By this means we obtain the equivalent of a larger and heavier 
air-chamber without the increased weight such would involve. 

As originally used a quantity of hydrocarbon fuel was placed in 
the air-vessel. Upon discharging the torpedo this fuel was auto- 
matically ignited and the contents of the air-chamber were heated. 
Unless, however, the combustion could be regulated there were 
serious risks of abnormal pressures, of overheating and weakening 
the air-vessel. Deviceshave been applied to overcome this liability, 
and other methods devised to obtain the same result. 

By the use of heating and thereby increasing the volume of air 
in proportion to the rise of temperature the extra volume will 
aljow of a.n increased speed for a given range or a greater range 
without increase of speed. The limit to the development of this 
system seems to be the temperature the materials will stand, but 
even at this early stage it has added several knots to the speed of 
this wonderful weapon. 
b Torpedo Carriages and Discharge. — As no gun which is ineffi- 
ciently mounted can give good results, so the best torpedo is valueless 
without a good carriage or system of discharge. In the early days 
of the Whitehead, discredit came upon it because the importance 
of this was not sufficiently realized; and an erratic course under 
water was in nine cases out of tendue to a crude method of dis- 
charge. A delicate piece of mechanism was dropped into the water 
from a height of several feet, and naturally suffered internal derange- 
ment. Gun-ports were then used for the purpose, but now a special 
orifice is made, to which the torpedo carriage is fitted with a ball- 
and-socket joint — forming a water-tight aperture — so that this 
carriage or tube may be only 2 or 3 ft. above the water-line. The 
ball-and-socket joint enables it also to have a considerable angle 
of training. Originally the torpedo was pushed out by a rod 
acted upon by compressed air, in which case the carriage was a

The efficiency of the Whitehead torpedo has thus been enormously 
increased, and more accurate practice can now be made at 
2000 yds. than was formerly possible at 800 yds. This adds con- 
siderably to the chances of torpedo-boats attacking ships, even in 
day-time, at sea or at anchor, and will render further protection 
necessary against this weapon. Against a ship in motion there is 
still, however, the calculation as to her speed and the distance she 
will travel before the torpedo reaches her. Should this be mis- 
calculated, an increased range for torpedoes will magnify the error. 
For instance, a 30-knot torpedo will travel 1000 yds. in a minute. 
If aimed at a ship on the beam assumed to be steaming 15 knots 
an hour, to reach her when 1000 yds. distant the torpedo must 
be discharged at a point 500 yds. ahead of her. But if the ship 
is actually steaming 12 knots, she will have travelled only 400 yds. 
in the minute, and the torpedo will be 100 yds. in advanceof 
her. If discharged at a range of 500 yds., such a miscalculation 
causes an error of only 50 yds. or 150 ft. But if the object is 
300 it. long, and her centre was taken as the target, her bow would 
be just at the spot the torpedo would reach in thirty seconds. It 
would seem, therefore, that increased velocity of torpedo is necessary 
before the full advantages of the gyroscope can be realized. Now 
the range oi the torpedo is entirely dependent upon the store of 
energy which can be carried; upon, therefore, the capacity of the 
air reservoir, the maximum pressure it can stand, andon the effici- 
ency of the propelling engines. The speed over a given range is 
also dependent upon these factors ; the maximum speed being 



of Gyroscope in Torpedo, 
simple frame. The rod, pressing against the tail with some force, 
was apt to damage or disarrange the rudders, so the air-gun took 
the place of rod impulse. Here the torpedo fits closely in a tube 
or cylinder with an opening at the rear made air-tight when closed. 
At the desired moment compressed air is admitted to the rear 
part of the cylinder and blows the torpedo out. Gunpowder then 
superseded air for this operation; and now this has given place to 
a small charge of cordite, which does not leave any deposit on the 
inside of the cylinder. There is a double risk in the use of locomotive 
torpedoes from above water. (1) The charge may be exploded 
by hostile fire. Though mainly consisting of damp gun-cotton, 
which is- not readily ignited, the dry primer and detonator may be 
struck, which would lead to a disastrous explosion. (2) The air- 
chamber is also a source of danger. As it contains air compressed 
to a high degree of tension, experiments have shown that if struck 
by a spall shell it may burst with great violence; and as it offers 
a considerable mark, this is not an improbable event in an action. 
An instance of the danger of above- water torpedo tubes occurred 
in the Spanish-American War at the battle of Santiago. A shell 
entered the " Almirante Oquendo " and struck a 14-in. torpedo 
in the tube. The charge detonated, causing a fearful explosion 
and practically wrecking that part of the vessel. The develop- 
ment of moderate-sized quick-firing guns has increased this risk. 
Hence we find the use of above-water torpedo tubes now mainly 
confined to torpedo and other craft too small for submerged 
discharge.

discharge. From the earliest days of the weapon this has been 
employed to some extent. But it was^ principally in the direction 
of right-ahead fire, by having an orifice in the stem of the ship under 
water, to which a torpedo tube was connected. The tactical 
idea was thus to supplement attack with the ram, so that if the 
vessel endeavouring to ram saw that the object would evade this 
attack, she could project a torpedo ahead, which, travelling faster 
than the vessel, might as effectually accomplish the required service. 
The stem orifice had a water-tight cover, which was removed on 
the torpedo being placed in the tube and the inner door closed; 
then, sufficient impulse being imparted to eject the torpedo, and its 
machinery being set in motion at the same time, it darted forward 
towards the enemy. There is, however, some risk of the ship using 
a torpedo in this manner striking it before the missile has gathered 
the necessary impetus from its propellers to take it clear of the 
vessel. The system, moreover, has the disadvantage of weakening 
the ram, the construction of which should be of immense strength. 
There is the further liability of ramming with a torpedo in the bow 
tube, which would be as disastrous to friend as foe. This method 
of submerged discharge has therefore given place to ejecting the 
torpedo from the broadside. Considerable difficulty attached to 
getting the torpedo clear of the ship from this position without 
injury, especially when the vessel was proceeding at speed. The 
natural tendency of the passing water acting on the head of 
the torpedo as it emerged was to give a violent wrench and crush 
the rear end before that portion could clear the aperture. To prevent 
this the Jorpedo must be held rigid in the line of projection until 
the tail is clear of the ship. This is thus effected. Besides the 
tube with the aperture in side of the ship under water, fitted with 
sluice-valve, all broadside submerged discharge apparatus possess 
the following features: A shield is pushed out from the ship's 
side. In this shield there are grooves of some form. Guides on 
the torpedoes fit and run in these grooves. When discharged the 
torpedo is thus supported against the streams of passing water, 
and guided so that its axis continues in the line of projection until 
the tail is clear of the side, the shield being of such length that this 
occurs at the same time that the guides on the torpedo leave the 
grooves in the shield. An apparatus on this principle has been 
fitted to a number of ships of the British navy, and gives good 
results at high rates of speed. It has the defect that the shield 
must be run out previous to the torpedo being discharged, and 
brought back afterwards, thus involving three separate operations, 
each performed by compressed air. 

In the broadside submerged discharge, designed, constructed 
and supplied to many foreign navies by Messrs Armstrong of the 
Elswick works, the three operations are combined in one. There is 
an outer tube as before, but it contains an inner tube carrying the 
torpedo. Fized to this tube, and prolonging it, is the shield fitted 
with grooves. Both tubes have a door at the rear — made air- 
tight when closed — by which the torpedo is entered. A charge of 
cordite is used for ejection instead of compressed air, the gas from 
which entering the outer cylinder first forces the inner tube out, 
and then by means of a valve in the door of the inner tube passes 
in and blows out water and torpedo together, the shield supporting 
the latter until the tail is clear of the ship. By this time the cordite 
gas has expanded and cooled so as to relieve the pressure in rear; 
this causes the pressure of the water outside to push the shield 



is placed in the explosion chamber, and a torpedo is in the tube, 
all is in readiness for firing when desired, without further attention 
in the torpedo-room. The cordite is fired by electricity from the 
conning-tower ; the officer, therefore, having ascertained that all is 
ready below, has only to press a button when the object is in the 
required position. Automatic indications are given in the conning- 
tower when the sluice-valve is opened and when all is in readiness 
for firing. 

This method of discharging torpedoes from the broadside under 
water eliminates the principal danger of the system, which required 
the shield to be put into position beforehand. It was then liable 
to be struck and distorted by passing wreckage without the fact 
being apparent to those in the ship. On the discharge of a torpedo 
its course might thus be arrested, or possibly the charge be pre- 
maturely exploded in dangerous proximity to its own ship. There 
was a risk of getting the shield out too soon, and thereby exposing 
it unduly to injury, or leaving the operation until too late. The 
tendency of naval equipment being towards complication, any 
readjustment which makes for simplicity cannot be otherwise 
than beneficial, and this feature is especially desirable in all matters 
connected with the use of torpedoes. 

The compartment containing the broadside submerged apparatus 
usually extends across the ship, so as to contain a tube for each 
side. 

Use.in War. — This has been mainly confined to attacks upon 
squadrons and single ships by torpedo craft of various types. 
At the battle of Yalu, between the Chinese and Japanese fleets, 
torpedoes were discharged by the former, but none took effect." 
The Japanese trusted solely to gun-fire. After the defeat of 
the Chinese at sea, their remaining ships took refuge in the 
harbour of Wei-hai-Wei. Here they were blockaded by the 
Japanese fleet, which, having a number of torpedo-boats, made 
several determined attacks upon the ships inside. After one 
or two attempts, foiled by the obstructions placed by the 
Chinese to bar the passage, the Japanese boats succeeded in 
torpedoing several ships, and thus expedited the reduction of the 
place. In the war between Spain and the United States the 
inferiority of Admiral Cervera's squadron to that under Admiral 
Sampson might at the battle of Santiago have been to some 
extent counterbalanced by a skilful and vigorous use of torpedoes. 
If, instead of striving only to escape, a bold dash had been made 
for the American ships, the Spanish cruisers rapidly approaching 
end on to the foe, enveloped in the smoke of their own guns, 
should — some at least — have got within torpedo range without 
fatal injury. Closing each other at a speed of 10 knots only 
they would cover an interval of 6000 yds. in 9 minutes — a 
short time in which to disable a ship by gun-fire under such 
conditions. But Cervera elected to offer a passive resistance 
only, and while suffering destruction wrought no material injury 
upon his opponents. On the other hand, there have . been 



TORPEDO

several instances of large warships being sunk by locomotive 
torpedoes discharged from small craft. During the Chilean 
revolutionary war of 1891, a battleship, the " Blanco Encalada," 
of 3500 tons, was attacked in Caldera Bay by two torpedo vessels 
— the" Lynch "and" Condell " — of 750 tons. They entered the 
bay at dawn, the " Condell " leading. This vessel fired three 
torpedoes which missed the ironclad; then the "Lynch," after 
one ineffective shot, discharged a second torpedo, which struck 
the " Blanco " on the side nearly amidships. The latter had 
opened fire with little result, and sank soon afterwards. A 
similar incident occurred in 1894, when the Brazilian ironclad 
" Aquidaban " was sunk in Catherina Bay by the " Sampaio " — 
a torpedo vessel of 500 tons. She entered the bay at night, 
and first discharged her bow torpedo at the ironclad, which 
missed; she then fired a broadside torpedo, which struck and 
exploded against the bow of the " Aquidaban." It caused a 
great shock on board, throwing an officer on the bridge into the 
water. The vessel sank soon afterwards, and the " Sampaio " 
escaped uninjured. 

In the war (1904-5) 'between Russia and Japan the Whitehead 
torpedo did not exercise an important influence upon the naval 
operations. It scored a success at the beginning of the struggle 
when a Japanese torpedo-flotilla made an attack upon the 
Russian fleet lying at anchor outside Port Arthur. For some 
unaccountable reason, though war was imminent, little or no 
precautions seemed to have been taken for effectually guarding 
the vessels. They had no nets in position nor boats patrolling 
outside them. Thus taken by surprise when the Japanese 
torpedo-boats suddenly appeared about midnight on the 8th of 
February 1904, several Russian ships were struck by torpedoes 
before they could offer any resistance. The most damaged 
were the " Retvisan " and " Tsarevitch " (battleships) and 
" Pallada " (cruiser), but all managed to get into Port Arthur 
and were eventually repaired. With three ships hots de 
combat the Russian fleet was considerably weakened at an 
early stage. The loss of the " Petropavlovsk " in April from a 
mine explosion was a further discouragement, especially as 
with this ship went down the gallant and energetic Admiral 
Makarov. In these circumstances the Russian fleet could not 
assume the offensive nor prevent the Japanese troops being 
sent by sea to invest Port Arthur. In June when the injured 
vessels were fit for service again the fleet put to sea but returned 
the same evening. The incident is noteworthy only because it 
led to an attack by the Japanese torpedo craft on the retiring 
squadron after sunset. As illustrating the uncertainty of hit- 
ting a moving object at sea with the Whitehead torpedo, already 
mentioned, no vessels were struck on this occasion and they 
reached the anchorage uninjured. In the battle of Tsushima 
the Japanese torpedo-boats attacked the Russian fleet after its 
disablement by gun-fire and gave the coup de grdce to some 
of the ships, which had little power of resistance owing to the 
destruction of their light armament. This war, therefore, did 
not increase to any extent our knowledge of the actual capability 
of this weapon. 

Effect upon Naval Tactics: Blockade, — It has often been 
assumed that steam and the torpedo will in future render 
blockade impossible as it was carried out in the old wars; that, 
no longer dependent upon the wind to allow egress from the 
blockaded port, a vessel using steam can emerge when she 
chooses, while the fear of torpedo attack will deter a blockading 
squadron from keeping such watch as to foil the attempt. As 
regards the power conferred by steam, it will be no less advan- 
tageous to a blockading squadron, enabling it to maintain its 
position, whereas sailing ships were often driven by gales to leave 
their station and seek a port. This gave opportunities for the 
blockaded vessels to escape. As regards torpedo-boats, they 
would no doubt be a danger to a blockading squadron unpro- 
vided with a means of defence against these craft. Such defence 
consists in an adequate number of small vessels interposing an 
in-shore squadron between the port and the main body outside. 
Thus they perform the twofold service of watching the enemy's 
movements within and frustrating a torpedo attack. As an 



instance of blockade under modern conditions, we have that 
of Admiral Sampson upon Santiago — a guard more rigidly 
maintained than any in the old wars. So little was he deterred 
by the knowledge that Admiral Cervera had two torpedo 
vessels in his force, that he drew his squadron closer in at night 
when an attack might be expected, actually illuminating the 
entrance of the harbour with his electric searchlights, so that 
no craft could come out unperceived. No attempt was made to 
dislodge him from that position, and we may assume that 
blockade, if required in any scheme of naval strategy, will be 
carried out, whatever the weapons of warfare. 

As regards the effect of torpedoes upon tactics at sea, and in 
general, as well as single ship, actions, they must operate against 
close range and employment of the ram. If it is recognized that 
a vessel within 1000 yds. is liable to a fatal blow, she will 
endeavour in ordinary circumstances to keep outside that 
distance and rely upon gun-fire. The exception would be where 
she is overmatched in that respect, and hence might endeavour 
to restore the balance by the use of torpedoes. In a fleet action 
the danger of missing a foe and hitting a friend would restrict 
the discharge of torpedoes; and this risk increases as formations 
disappear. But the torpedo must be conceded a tactical 
superiority over the ram for the following reasons: A vessel 
to use the latter must come within torpedo range, while her 
adversary may successfully apply torpedoes without placing 
herself in any danger of being rammed. The ram can only be 
used in one direction, and a small miscalculation may cause 
disaster. If a vessel has more than one position from which 
torpedoes can be discharged, she is not confined as regards 
attack to a single bearing or direction. 

In action we may consider the speed of the torpedo as double 
that of the ship, and since against a moving object allowance 
must be made for the space traversed while ram or torpedo is 
travelling towards it, the faster weapon is less affected in its 
chance of successful impact by change of direction and speed 
of the object at the last moment. Lastly, with machinery 
disabled a ship is powerless to use the ram, but can avert a ram 
attack with her torpedoes. The movements of squadrons or 
single ships on entering an action are not likely to be influenced 
by any contemplated immediate use of torpedoes, for the gun 
must remain the primary weapon, at any rate at the first 
onset. Commanders would hardly risk being crushed by 
gun-fire before getting within torpedo range. Having faith 
in the efficiency of their ordnance and the gunnery skill of their 
crew, they would first manoeuvre to bring these into play. 
Tactics for torpedo attack in such circumstances have not 
therefore been laid down, and it is only necessary to consider 
the positions which are advantageous for the use of this weapon, 
and, conversely, what should be avoided when a vessel, finding 
herself overmatched in gunnery, seeks to redress the balance 
with torpedoes. 

Size of Target. — This, with a ship, varies in length as the torpedo 
approaches end on to the vessel, or at angle to the line of keel; 
the greatest being when the path of both forms a right angle. 
Hencethe object is to place your ship where it presents the former 
condition to the enemy, while he affords the larger target. It 
must be remembered that, owing to the comparatively slow velocity 
of the torpedo, it must be aimed not directly at a ship in motion — 
like a shot from a gun — but at a point ahead which the ship will 
reach after the torpedo has traversed the intervening distance. 
Thus speed of object has to be estimated, and hence the importance 
of adding to the velocity of the torpedo and getting a broadside 
shot so as to reduce as much as^ possible errors of calculation. 
The great increase of the dimensions of warships, especially in 
length, which now has reached 500 ft., adds to the chances of a 
successful hit with torpedoes, and will doubtless tend to diminish 
a desire in future naval tactics to close inside torpedo range for the 
purpose of ramming. 

Range— Though the effective range of a torpedo discharged 
froma ship or torpedo vessel against a single object moving 
at high speed may be considered as approximately within 1000 
yds. this limit of distance is considerably augmented where the 
target consists of several vessels at sea in close order, or is that 
afforded by a fleet at anchor. In the first case it may be worth 
while to discharge torpedoes from a distance of two or three thou- 
sand yards at the centre of the line for the chance of hitting one of 
the vessels composing it. As regards a mass of ships at anchor,

unless protected by an impenetrable guard such as a breakwater 
or some invulnerable defence carried by the ships themselves, the 
increased range and accuracy of the torpedo imparted by recent 
developments would give it a chance of success if discharged against 
such a target at even greater^ distance. 

Finally, by improvements in construction and methods of dis- 
charge the torpedo has recovered the place it was rapidly losing a 
few years ago. As armour receives increased resisting power to 
above-water projectiles, and gets on a level again with the gun, 
more attention will be given to under-water attack, against which 
no adequate protection has yet been devised. Thus we. shall 
probably find the torpedo taking a very prominent place in any 
future war between the great maritime powers. (S. M E.-W.) 

TORQUAY, a municipal borough, seaport and watering place, 
in the Torquay parliamentary division of Devonshire, England, 
on Tor Bay of the English Channel, 26 m. S. of Exeter, by the 
Great Western railway. Pop. (1901), 33,625. Owing to the 
beauty of its site and the equability of its climate, and to its 
being screened by lofty hills on the north, east and west, and 
open to the sea-breezes of the south, it has a high reputation 
as a winter residence. The temperature seldom rises as high 
as 70 F. in summer or falls below freezing-point in winter. 
To the north lies the populous suburb of St Mary Church. 
There are some remains of Tor or Torre Abbey, founded 
for Praemonstratensians by William, Lord Brewer, in 1196. 
They stand north of the modern mansion, but, with the 
exception of a beautiful pointed arch portal, are of small 
importance. On the south of the gateway is a 13th-century 
building, known as the Spanish barn. On Chapel Hill are 
the remains of a chapel of the 12th century, dedicated to 
St Michael, and supposed to have formerly belonged to the 
abbey. St Saviour's parish church of Tor-Mohun, or Tor- 
moham, an ancient stone structure, was restored in 1874. 
The old church at St Mary Church, north of Torquay, was 
rebuilt in Early Decorated style; and in 18 71 a tower was 
erected as a memorial to Dr Phillpotts, bishop of Exeter, who 
with his wife is buried in the churchyard. St John's Church, 
by G. E. Street, is a fine example of modern Gothic. Among 
the principal buildings and institutions are the town-hall, 
museum of the natural history society, theatre and opera-house 
(1880), market, schools of art and science, the Torbay infirmary 
and dispensary, the Western hospital for consumption, Crypt 
House institution for invalid ladies and the Mildmay home for 
incurable consumptives. The control of the harbour, piers, 
pleasure grounds, &c, was acquired from the lord of the manor 
by the local board in 1886. The harbour has a depth of over 
20 ft. at low water. The principal imports are coal, timber 
and slates, and the principal export stone of the Transition 
limestone or Devonshire marble. In the town are a number of 
marble-polishing works. Terra-cotta ware of fine quality is 
also manufactured from a deposit of clay at Watcombe and 
at Hele. The town is governed by a mayor, 9 aldermen and 
27 councillors. Area, 3588 acres. 

There was a village at Torre even before the foundation of the 
abbey, and in the neighbourhood of Torre evidence has been 
found of Roman occupation. The manor was granted by 
William the Conqueror to Richard de Bruvere or de Brewere, and 
was subsequently known as Tor Brewer. After the defeat of the 
Spanish Armada, Don Pedro's galley was brought into Torbay; 
and William, prince of Orange, landed at Torbay on the 5th of 
November 1688. Until the middle of the 19th century it was 
an insignificant fishing village. It was incorporated in 1 89 2 . 

TORQUE, or Torc (Lat. torquis, torques, a twisted collar, 
torquere, to twist), the term given by archaeologists to the 
twisted collars or armlets of gold or other metal worn particu- 
larly by the ancient Gauls and other allied Celtic races. The 
typical torque is a circlet with twisted rope-like strands, the ends 
not joined together; the torque was usually worn with the 
opening in the front as seen in a figure of a Gaul in a sculptured 
sarcophagus in the Capitoline Museum at Rome. In mechanics, 
the term " torque " is used of the turning-moment of a system- 
force, as in a series dynamo. 

TORQUEMADA, JUAN DE (1388-1468), or rather Johannes 
de Turrecremata, Spanish ecclesiastic, was born at Valladolid, 



in 1388, and was educated in that city. At an early age he 
joined the Dominican order, and soon distinguished himself 
for learning and devotion. In 141 5 he accompanied the general 
of his order to the Council of Constance, whence he proceeded 
to Paris for study, and took his doctor's degree in 1423. After 
teaching for some time in Paris he became prior of the Dominican 
house first in Valladolid and then in Toledo. In 143 1 Pope 
Eugenius IV. called him to Rome and made him " magister 
sancti palatii." At the Council of Basel he was one of the ablest 
supporters of the view of the Roman curia, and he was rewarded 
with a cardinal's hat in 1439. He died at Rome on the 26th of 
September 1468. 

His principal works are In Gratiani Decretum commentarii 
(4 vols., Venice, 1578); Expositio brevis et utilis super toto psatterio 
(Mainz, 1474); Quaestiones spirituales super evangelia totius anni 
(Brixen, 1498); Summa ecclesiastica (Salamanca, 1550). The last- 
named work has the following topics: (1) De universa ecclesia; 
(2) De Ecclesia romana^ et pontificis primatu ; (3) De universali- 
bus conciliis; (4) De schismaticis et haereticis. His De conceptione 
deiparae Mariae, libri viii. (Rome, 1547), was edited with preface 
and notes by E. B. Pusey (London, 1869 seq.). 

TORQUEMADA, THOMAS (1420-1498), inquisitor-general of 
Spain, son of Don Pedro Ferdinando, lord of Torquemada, a small 
town in Old Castile, was born in 1420 at Valladolid during the 
reign of John II. Being nephew to the well-known cardinal of the 
same name, he early displayed an attraction for the Dominican 
order; and, as soon as allowed, he joined the Friars Preachers 
in their convent at Valladolid. His biographers state that he 
showed himself from the beginning very earnest in austere life 
and humility; and he became a recognized example" of the 
virtues of a Dominican. Valladolid was then the capital, and in 
due course eminent dignities were offered to him, but he gave 
signs of a determination to lead the simple life of a Friar Preacher, 
In the convent, his modesty was so great that he refused to 
accept the doctor's degree in theology, which is the highest 
prized honour in the order. His superiors, however, obliged 
him to take the priorship of the convent of Santa Cruz in 
Segovia, where he ruled for twenty-two years. The royal family, 
especially the queen and the infanta Isabella, often stayed at 
Segovia, and Torquemada became confessor to the infanta, 
who was then very young. He trained her to look on her 
future sovereignty as an engagement to make religion respected. 
Esprit Flechier, bishop of Nimes, in this Histoire du cardinal 
Jimenes (Paris, 1693), says that Torquemada made her promise 
that when she became queen she would make it her principal 
business to chastise and destroy heretics. He then began to 
teach her the political advantages of religion and to prepare the 
way for that tremendous engine in the hands of the state, the 
Inquisition. 

Isabella succeeded to the throne (1474) on the death of 
Henry IV. Torquemada had always been strong in his advice 
that she should marry Ferdinand of Aragon and thus consolidate 
the kingdoms of Spain. Hitherto he had rarely appeared at 
court; but now the queen entrusted him not only with the care of 
her conscience, but also with the benefices in the royal patronage. 
He also helped her in quieting Ferdinand, who was chafing under 
the privileges of the Castilian grandees, and succeeded so 
well that the king also took him as confessor. Refusing the rich 
see of Seville and many other preferments he accepted that 
of councillor of state. For a long time he had pondered over 
the confusion in which Spain was, which he attributed to the 
intimate relations allowed between Christians and infidels for 
the sake of commerce. He saw Jews, Saracens, heretics and 
apostates roaming through Spain unmolested; and in this lax 
toleration of religious differences he thought he saw the main 
obstacle to the political union of the Spains, which was the 
necessity of the hour. He represented to Ferdinand and 
Isabella that it was essential to their safety to reorganize the 
Inquisition, which had since the 13th century (1236) been 
established in Spain. The bishops, who were ex officio inquisitors 
in their own dioceses, had not succeeded in putting a stop to 
the evils, nor had the friars, by whom they had been practically 
superseded. By the middle of the 15th century there was 



TORQUEMADA, T. 



59 






hardly an active inquisitor left in the kingdom. In 1473 
Torquemada and Gonzalez de Mendoza, archbishop of Toledo, 
approached the sovereigns. Isabella had been for many years 
prepared, and she and Ferdinand, now that the proposal for 
this new tribunal came before them, saw in it a means of over- 
coming the independence of the nobility and clergy by which 
the royal power had been obstructed. With the royal sanction 
a petition was addressed to Sixtus IV. for the establishment of 
this new form of Inquisition; and as the result of a long intrigue, 
in 1479 a papal bull authorized the appointment by the Spanish 
sovereigns of two inquisitors at Seville, under whom the 
Dominican inquisitions already established elsewhere might serve. 
In the persecuting activity that ensued the Dominicans, " the 
Dogs of the Lord " (Domini canes), took the lead. Commissaries 
of the Holy Office were sent into different provinces, and ministers 
of the faith were established in the various cities to take cogni- 
sance of the crimes of heresy, apostasy, sorcery, sodomy and 
polygamy, these three last being considered to be implicit 
heresy. The royal Inquisition thus started was subversive of. 
the regular tribunals of the bishops, who much resented the 
innovation, which, however, had the power of the state at its 
back. 

In 1481, three years after the Sixtine commission, a tribunal 
was inaugurated at Seville, where freedom of speech and licence 
of manner were rife. The inquisitors at once began to detect 
errors. In order not to confound the innocent with the guilty, 
Torquemada published a declaration offering grace and pardon 
to all who presented themselves before the tribunal and avowed 
their fault. Some fled the country, but many (Mariana says 
17,000) offered themselves for reconciliation. The first seat of 
the Holy Office was in the convent of San Pablo, where the friars, 
however, resented the orders, on the pretext that they were not 
delegates of the inquisitor-general. Soon the gloomy fortress of 
Triana, on the opposite bank of the Guadalquivir, was prepared 
as the palace of the Holy Office; and the terror-stricken Sevil- 
lianos read with dismay over the portals the motto of the 
Inquisition: " Exsurge, Domine, Judica causam tuam, Capite 
nobis vulpes." Other tribunals, like that of Seville and under 
La Supretna, were speedily established in Cordova, Jaen and 
Toledo. The sovereigns saw that wealth was beginning to flow 
in to the new tribunals by means of fines and confiscations; 
and they obliged Torquemada to take as assessors five persons 
who would represent them in all matters affecting the royal 
prerogatives. These assessors were allowed a definite vote in 
temporal matters but not in spiritual, and the final decision 
was reserved to Torquemada himself, who in 1483 was appointed 
the sole inquisitor-general over all the Spanish possessions. In 
the next year he ceded to Diego Deza, a Dominican, his office of 
confessor to the sovereigns, and gave himself up to the congenial 
work of reducing heretics. A general assembly of his inquisitors 
was convoked at Seville for the 29th of November 1484; and 
there he promulgated a code of twenty-eight articles for the 
guidance of the ministers of the faith. Among these rules are 
the following, which will give some idea of the procedure. 
Heretics were allowed thirty days to declare themselves. Those 
who availed themselves of this grace were only fined, and their 
goods escaped confiscation. Absolution in foro extemo was 
forbidden to be given secretly to those who made voluntary 
confession; they had to submit to the ignominy of the public 
aulo-de-fi. The result of this harsh law was that numerous 
applications were made to Rome for secret absolution; and thus 
much money escaped the Inquisition in Spain. Those who 
were reconciled were deprived of all honourable employment, 
and were forbidden to use gold, silver, jewelry, silk or fine wool. 
Against this law, too, many petitions went to Rome for rehabili- 
tation, until in 1498 the Spanish pope Alexander VI. granted 
leave to Torquemada to rehabilitate the condemned, and with- 
drew practically all concessions hitherto made and paid for at 
Rome. Fines were imposed by way of penance on those 
confessing willingly. If a heretic in the Inquisition asked for 
absolution, he could receive it, but subject to a life imprisonment; 
but if his repentance were but feigned he could be at once 



condemned and handed over to the civil power for execution. 
Should the accused, after the testimony against him had been 
made public, continue to deny the charge, he was to be con- 
demned as impenitent. When serious proof existed against one 
who denied his crime, he could be submitted to the question by 
torture; and if under torture he avowed his fault and confirmed 
his guilt by subsequent confession he was punished as one con- 
victed; but should he retract he was again to be submitted to 
the tortures or condemned to extraordinary punishment. This 
second questioning was afterwards forbidden; but the prohibi- 
tion was got over by merely suspending and then renewing the 
sessions for questioning. It was forbidden to communicate to 
the accused the entire copy of the declaration of the witnesses. 
The dead even were not free from the Holy Office ; but processes 
could be instituted against them and their remains subjected 
to punishment. But along with these cruel and unjust measures 
there must be put down to Torquemada's credit some advanced 
ideas as to prison life. The cells of the Inquisition were, as a rule, 
large, airy, clean and with good windows admitting the sun. 
They'were, in those respects, far superior to the civil prisons of 
that day. The use of irons was in Torquemada's time not 
allowed in the Holy Office; the use of torture was in accordance 
with the practice of the other royal tribunals; and when these 
gave it up the Holy Office did so also. 

Such were some of the methods that Torquemada introduced 
into the Spanish Inquisition, which was to have so baneful an 
effect upon the whole country. During the eighteen years that 
he was inquisitor-general it is said that he burnt 10,220 persons, 
condemned 6860 others to be burnt in effigy, and reconciled 
97,321, thus making an average of some 6000 convictions a year. 
These figures are given by Llorente, who was secretary of the 
Holy Office from 1790 to 1792 and had access to the archives; 
but modern research reduces the list of those burnt by Torque- 
mada to 2000, in itself an awful holocaust to the principle of 
intolerance. The constant stream of petitions to Rome opened 
the eyes of the pope to the effects of Torquemada's severity. 
On three separate occasions he had to send Fray Alfonso Badaja 
to defend his acts before the Holy See. The sovereigns, too, 
saw the stream of money, which they had hoped for, diverted 
to the coffers of the Holy Office, and in 1493 they made com- 
plaint to the pope; but Torquemada was powerful enough to 
secure most of the money for the expenses of the Inquisition. 
But in 1496, when the sovereigns again complained that the 
inquisitors were, without royal knowledge or consent, disposing 
of the property of the condemned and thus depriving the public 
revenues of considerable sums, Alexander VI. appointed Jimenes 
to examine into the case and make the Holy Office disgorge the 
plunder. 

For many years Torquemada had been persuading the sove- 
reigns to make an attempt once for all to rid the country of the 
hated Moors. Mariana holds that the founding of the Inquisi- 
tion, by giving a new impetus to the idea of a united kingdom, 
made the country more capable of carrying to a satisfactory 
ending the traditional wars against the Moors. The taking of 
Zahaia in 1481 by the enemy gave occasion to reprisals. Troops 
were summoned to Seville and the war began by the siege of 
Alhama, a town eight leagues from Granada, the Moorish 
capital. Torquemada went with the sovereigns to Cordova, to 
Madrid or wherever the states-general were held, to urge on 
the war; and he obtained from the Holy See the same spiritual 
favours that had been enjoyed by the Crusaders. But he did 
not forget his favourite work of ferreting out heretics; and his 
ministers of the faith made great progress over all the kingdom, 
especially at Toledo, where merciless severity was shown to the 
Jews who had lapsed from Christianity. The Inquisition, 
although as a body the clergy did not mislike it, sometimes 
met with furious opposition from the nobles and common people. 
At Valentia and Lerida there were serious conflicts. At 
Saragossa Peter Arbue, a canon and an ardent inquisitor, 
was slain in 1485 whilst praying in a church; and the threats 
against the hated Torquemada made him go in fear of his life, 
and he never went abroad without an escort of forty familiars

of the Holy Office on horseback and two hundred more on 
foot. In 1487 he went with Ferdinand to Malaga and thence to 
Valladolid, where in the October of 1488 he held another general 
congregation of the Inquisition and promulgated new laws 
based on the experience already gained. He then hurried 
back to Andalusia where he joined the sovereigns, who 
were now besieging Granada, which he entered with the 
conquering army in January 1492 and built there a convent 
of his order. 

The Moors being vanquished, now came the turn of the 
Jews. In 1490 had happened the case of El Santo nino de 
la Guardia — a child supposed to have been killed by the Jews. 
His existence had never been proved; and in the district of 
Guardia no child was reported as missing. The whole story 
was most probably the creation of imaginations stimulated by 
torture and despair, unless it was a deliberate fiction set forth 
for the purpose of provoking hostility against the Jews. For 
a long time- Torquemada had tried to get the royal consent to 
a general expulsion; but the sovereigns hesitated, and, as the 
victims were the backbone of the commerce of the country, 
proposed a ransom of 300,000 ducats instead. The indignant 
friar would hear of no compromise: "Judas," he cried, "sold 
Christ for 30 pence; and your highnesses wish to sell Him again 
for 300,000 ducats." Unable to bear up against the Domini- 
can's fiery denunciations, the sovereigns, three months after 
the fall of Granada, issued a decree ordering every Jew either 
to embrace Christianity or to leave the country, four months 
being given to make up their minds; and those who refused to 
become Christians to order had leave to sell their property and 
carry off their effects. But this was not enough for the in- 
quisitor-general, who in the following month (April) issued orders 
to forbid Christians, under severe penalties, having any communi- 
cation with the Jews or, after the period of grace, to supply 
them even with the necessaries of life. The former prohibition 
made it impossible for the unfortunate people to sell their 
goods which hence fell to the Inquisition. The numbers 
of Jewish families driven out of the country by Torquemada 
is variously stated from Mariana's 1,700,000 to the more 
probable 800,000 of later historians. The loss to Spain was 
enormous, and from this act of the Dominican the commercial 
decay of Spain dates. 

Age was now creeping on Torquemada, who, however, never 
would allow his misdirected zeal to rest. At another general 
assembly, his fourth, he gave new and more stringent rules, which 
are found in the Compilacidn de las instrucciones del officio de la 
Santa Inquisicidn. He took up his residence in Avila, where 
he had built a convent; and here he resumed the common life 
of a friar, leaving his cell in October 1497 to visit, at Salamanca, 
the dying infante, Don Juan, and to comfort the sovereigns 
in their parental distress. They often used to visit him at 
Avila, where in 1498, still in office as inquisitor-general, he 
held his last general assembly to complete his life's work. 
Soon afterwards he died, on the 16th of September 1498, 
" full of years and merit " says his biographer. He was buried 
in the chapel of the convent of St Thomas in Avila. 

The name of Torquemada stands for all that is intolerant 
and narrow, despotic and cruel. He was no real statesman 
or minister of the Gospel, but a blind fanatic, who failed to 
see that faith, which is the gift of God, cannot be imposed on 
any conscience by force. (E. Tn.) 

TORRE ANNUNZIATA, a seaport of Campania, Italy, in 
the province of Naples, on the east of the Bay of Naples, and 
at the south foot of Mt Vesuvius, 14 m. S.E. of Naples by rail. 
Pop. (1901), 25,070 (town); 28,084 (commune). It is on the main 
line to Battipaglia, at the point of junction of a branch line 
from Cancello round the east of Vesuvius, and of the branch to 
Castellammare di Stabia and Gragnano. It has a royal arms 
factory established by Charles IV., and other ironworks, 
considerable manufacture of macaroni, paper, breeding of 
silkworms, and some fishing and shipping. The harbour is 
protected by moles. Remains attributed to the Roman post- 
station of Oplontis were discovered in making the railway 



between Torre del Greco and Torre Annunziata, a little west of 
the latter, in 1842. 

TORRE DEL GRECO, a seaport of Campania, Italy, in the 
province of Naples, 7! m. S.E. of that city by rail. Pop. 
(1901), 35,328. It lies at the south-west foot of Vesuvius, on the 
shore of the Bay of Naples. It is built chiefly of lava, and stands 
on the lava stream of 1631, which destroyed two-thirds of the 
older town. Great damage was done by the eruptions of 
1737 and 1794; the earthquake of 1857 and the eruption of the 
8th of December 1 861 were even more destructive. After each dis- 
aster the people returned, the advantage of the rich volcanic land 
overcoming apprehensions of danger. In the outskirts are 
many beautiful villas and gardens. The town has shipbuilding 
yards and lava quarries. The inhabitants take part in the 
coral and sponge fishing off the African and Sicilian coasts, and 
coral is worked in the town. There is also fishing for tunny, 
sardines and oysters; hemp is woven, and the neighbourhood 
is famed for its fruit and wine. In June the great popular 
.festival " Dei Quattro Altari " is annually celebrated 'here in 
commemoration of the abolition of the feudal dominion in 
1700. Remains of ancient villas and baths have been found 
here. 

TORRENS, ROBERT (1780-1864), English soldier and econo- 
mist, was born in Ireland in 1780. He entered the Marines 
in 1797, became a captain in 1806, and major in 181 1 for 
bravery in Anhalt during the Walcheren expedition. He 
fought in the Peninsula, becoming lieutenant-colonel in 1835 
and retiring as colonel in 1837. After abortive attempts to 
enter parliament in 1818 and 1826, he was returned in 1831 as 
member for Ashburton. He was a prolific writer, principally on 
financial and commercial policy. Almost the whole of the pro- 
gramme which was carried out in legislation by Sir Robert Peel 
had been laid down in his economic writings. He was an 
early and earnest advocate of the repeal of the corn laws, 
but was not in favour of a general system of absolute free trade, 
maintaining that it is expedient to impose retaliatory duties 
to countervail similar duties imposed by foreign countries, 
and a lowering of import duties on the productions of countries 
retaining their hostile tariffs would occasion a decline in 
prices, profits and wages. 

His principal writings of a general character were: The Economist 
[i.e. Physiocrat] refuted (1808); Essay on the Production of Wealth 
£1821); Essay on the External Corn-trade (eulogized by Ricardo) 
(1827); The Budget, a Series of Letters on Financial, Commercial 
and Colonial Policy (1841-1843); The Principles and Practical 
Operations 'of Sir Robert PeeVs Act of 1844 Explained and Defended 
(1847). 

TORRENS, SIR ROBERT RICHARD (1814-1884), British 
colonial statesman, was born at Cork, Ireland, in 1814, and 
educated at Trinity College, Dublin. He went to South Aus- 
tralia in 1840, and was appointed collector of customs. He was 
an official member of the first legislative council and in 1852 
was treasurer and registrar-general. When responsible govern- 
ment was established he was elected as a representative for 
Adelaide and became a member of the first ministry. In 1857 
he introduced his famous Real Property Act, the principle of 
which consists of conveyance by registration and certificate 
instead of deeds. The system was rapidly adopted in the other 
colonies and elsewhere, and was expounded by the author during 
a visit to the United Kingdom in 1862-1864. After leaving 
South Australia, Sir R. R. Torrens represented Cambridge 
in the House of Commons from 1868 to 1874; in 1872 he was 
knighted. He was the author of works on the effect of the 
gold discoveries on the currency, and other subjects. He died 
on the 31st of August 1884. 

TORRENS, WILLIAM TORRENS M'CULLAGH (1813-1894), 
English politician and social reformer, son of James M'Cullagh 
(whose wife's maiden name, Torrens, he assumed in 1863), 
was born near Dublin on the 13th of October 1813. He was 
called to the bar, and in 1835 became assistant commissioner 
on the special commission on Irislupoor-relief, which resulted 
in the extension of the workhouse system in Ireland in 
1838. In the 'forties he joined the Anti-Corn Law League,

and in 1846 published his Industrial History of Free Nations. 
In 1847 he was elected to parliament for Dundalk, and sat 
till 1852. In 1857 he was elected as a Liberal for Yarmouth 
and from 1865 to 1885 he represented Finsbury. Torrens 
was a well known man in political life, and devoted himself 
mainly to social questions in parliament. It was an amend- 
ment of his to the Education Bill of 1870 which established 
the London School Board, and his Artisans' Dwellings Bill in 
1868 facilitated the clearing away of slums by local authorities. 
He published several books, and his Twenty Years in Parlia- 
ment (1893) and History of Cabinets (1894) contain useful 
material. He died in London on the 26th of April 1894. 

TORRES NAHARRO, BARTOLOM^ DE (1480-1 530), 
Spanish dramatist, was born towards the end of the 15th century 
at Torres, near Badajoz. After some years of soldiering and of 
captivity in Algiers, Torres Naharro took orders, settled in 
Rome about 151 1, and there devoted himself chiefly to writing 
plays. Though he alludes to the future pope, Clement VII. as 
his protector, he left Rome to enter the household of Fabrizio 
Colonna at Naples where his works were printed under the title 
of Propaladia (1517). He is conjectured to have returned to his 
native place, and to have died there shortly after 1529, His 
Didlogo del nacimiento is written in unavowed, though obvious, 
imitation of Encina, but in his subsequent plays he shows a 
much larger conception of dramatic possibilities. He classifies his 
pieces as comedias d noticia and comedias & fantasia) the former, 
of which the Soldatesca and Tinellaria are examples, present 
in dramatic form incidents within his personal experience; the 
latter, which include such plays as Serafina, Himenea, Calamita 
and Aquilana, present imaginary episodes with adroitness and 
persuasiveness. Torres Naharro is much less dexterous in stage- 
craft than many inferior successors, his humour is rude and 
boisterous and his diction is unequal; but to a varied knowledge 
of human nature he adds knowledge of dramatic effect, and his 
rapid dialogue, his fearless realism and vivacious fancy prepared 
the way for the romantic drama in Spain. 

TORRES NOVAS, a town of Portugal, in the district of San- 
tarem, 19 m. N.N.E. of Santarem on the Lisbon-Entroncamento 
railway. Pop. (1900), 10,746. It manufactures cottons, linens, 
jute, paper, leather and spirits. It was probably founded by 
Greeks, and was held by the Romans, Goths and Moors, from 
whom it was conquered in 1148 by Alphonso I. of Portugal. 

TORRES VEDRAS, a town of Portugal, in the district of 
Lisbon, 43 m. N. by W. of Lisbon, on the Lisbon-Figueira da 
Foz railway. Pop. (1900), 6900. Torres Vedras is built on 
the left bank of the river Sizandro; it has a Moorish citadel 
and hot sulphur baths. Roman inscriptions and other remains 
have been found here, but the Latin name of the town, Turres 
Veteres t is probably medieval. Here were the noted fortifica- 
tions known as the " lines of Torres Vedras," constructed by 
Wellington in 1810 (see Peninsular War). Here also in 1846 
the troops of General Saldanha defeated those of the count 
de Bomfin and seized the castle and town (see Portugal: 
History) . 

TORRES Y VILLAROEL, DIEGO DE (1696-1759?), Spanish 
miscellaneous writer, was born in 1696 at Salamanca, where his 
father was bookseller to the university. In his teens Torres 
escaped to Portugal where he enlisted under a false name; he 
next moved to Madrid, living from hand to mouth as a hawker; 
in 1717 he was ordained subdeacon, resumed his studies at 
Salamanca, and in 1726 became professor of mathematics at 
the university. A friend of his having stabbed a priest, Torres 
was suspected of complicity, and once more fled to Portugal, 
where he remained till his innocence was proved. He then 
returned to his chair, which he resigned in 1751 to act as steward 
to two noblemen; he was certainly alive in 1758, but the date 
of his death is not known. Torres had so slight a smattering 
of mathematics that his appointment as professor was thought 
scandalous even in his own scandalous age; yet he quickly 
acquired a store of knowledge which he displayed with serene 
assurance. His almanacs, his verses, his farces, his devotional 
and pseudo-scientific writings show that he possessed the alert 



adaptiveness of the born adventurer; but all that remains of 
his fourteen volumes (1745-1752) is his autobiography, an 
amusing record of cynical effrontery and successful imposture.

yielding more than 100,000 tons a year. The other industries 
are chiefly fishing, shipbuilding and the manufacture of ropes 
and sails. The roadstead affords safe anchorage. There is an 
active trade in fruit and agricultural products. 

TORREY, JOHN (1796-1873), American botanist, was born 
at New York on the 15th of August 1796. When he was 15 
or 16 years of age his father received a prison appointment at 
Greenwich, and there he made the acquaintance of Amos Eaton 
(1776-1842)^ pioneer of natural history studies in America. He 
thus learned the elements of botany, as well as something of 
mineralogy and chemistry. In 1815 he began the study of 
medicine, qualifying in 1818. In the following year he issued 
his Catalogue of Plants growing spontaneously within Thirty Miles 
of the City of New York, and in 1824 he issued the first and only 
volume of his Flora of the Northern and Middle States. In the 
same year he obtained the chair of chemistry and geology at 
West Point military academy, and three years later the pro- 
fessorship of chemistry and botany in the College of Physicians 
and Surgeons, New York. In 1836 he was appointed botanist 
to the state of New York and produced his Flora of that state in 
1843; while from 1838 to 1843 he carried on the publication of 
the earlier portions of Flora of North America, with the assistance 
of his pupil, Asa Gray. From 1853 he was chief assayer to the 
United States assay office, but he continued to take an interest 
in botanical teaching until his death at New York on the 10th 
of March 1873. He made over his valuable herbarium and 
botanical library to Columbia College in i860, and he was the 
first president of the Torrey Botanical Club in 1873. His name 
is commemorated in the small coniferous genus Torreya, found 
in North America and in China and Japan. T. taxifolia, a 
native of Florida, is known as the Torrey tree or savin, and also 
as the stinking cedar. 

TORREY, REUBEN ARCHER (1856- * ), American evange- 
list, was born in Hoboken, New Jersey, on the 28th of January 
1856. He graduated at Yale University in 1875 and at the Yale 
Divinity School in 1878. He became a Congregational minister 
in 1878, studied theology at Leipzig and Erlanger in 1882-1883, 
joined D. L. Moody in his evangelistic work in Chicago in 1889, 
and became pastor of the Chicago Avenue Church in 1894 and 
afterwards superintendent of the Moody Bible Institute of 
Chicago. In 1902-1903 he preached in nearly every part of the 
English-speaking world, and with Charles McCallon Alexander 
(b. 1867) conducted revival services in Great Britain in 1903-: 
1905; Torrey conducted a similar campaign in American and 
Canadian cities in 1906-1907. 

TORRICELLI, EVANGELISTA (1608-1647), Italian physicist 
and mathematician, was born at Faenza on the 15th of October 
1608. Left fatherless at an early age, he was educated under 
the care of his uncle, a Camaldolese monk, who in 1627 sent him 
to Rome to study science under the Benedictine Benedetto 
Castelli (1 577-1644), professor of mathematics at the Collegio 
di Sapienza. The perusal of Galileo's Dialoghi delle nuove 
scienze (1638) inspired him with many developments of the 
mechanical principles there set forth, which he embodied in a 
treatise De motu (printed amongst his Opera geometrica, 1644). 
Its communication by Castelli to Galileo in 1641, with a proposal 
that Torricelli should reside with him, led to Torricelli repairing 
to Florence, where he met Galileo, and acted as his amanuensis 
during the three remaining months of his life. After Galileo's 
death Torricelli was nominated grand-ducal mathematician 
and professor of mathematics in the Florentine academy. The 
discovery of the principle of the barometer (q.v.) which has 
perpetuated his fame (" Torricellian tube " " Torricellian 
vacuum ") was made in 1643.

TORRIDONIAN— TORRINGTON, EARL OF 



The publication amongst Torricelli's Opera geometrica 
(Florence, 1644) of a tract on the properties of the cycloid 
involved him in a controversy with G. P. de Roberval, who 
accused him of plagiarizing his earlier solution of the problem of 
its quadrature. There seems, however, no room for doubt that 
Torricelli's was arrived at independently. The matter was 
still in debate when he was seized with pleurisy, and died at 
Florence on the 25th of October 1647. He was buried in San 
Lorenzo, and a commemorative statue of him erected at Faenza 
in 1864. 

Among the new truths detected by him was the valuable 
mechanical principle that if any number of bodies be so con- 
nected that, by their motion, their centre of gravity can neither 
ascend nor descend, then those bodies are in equilibrium. He 
also discovered the remarkable fact that the parabolas described 
(in a vacuum) by indefinitely numerous projectiles discharged 
from the same point with equal velocities, but in all directions 
have a paraboloid of revolution for their envelope. His theorem 
that a fluid issues from a small orifice with the same velocity 
(friction and atmospheric resistance being neglected) which it 
would have acquired in falling through the depth from its sur- 
face is of fundamental importance in hydraulics. He greatly 
" improved both the telescope and microscope. Several large 
object lenses, engraven with his name, are preserved at Florence. 
He used and developed B. Cavalieri's method of indivisibles. 

A selection from Torricelli's manuscripts was published by 
Tommaso Bonaventura in 1715, with the title Lezioni accademiche 
(Florence). They include an address of acknowledgment on his 
admission to the Accademia della Crusca. His essay on the inun- 
dations of the Val di Chiana was printed in Raccolta d'autori 
che trattano del moto delV acque, iv. 1 15 (Florence, 1 768), and amongst 
Opusculi idraulici, iii. 347 (Bologna, 1822). For his life see Fabroni,

gelista Torricelli (Faenza, 1864); Tiraboschi, Storia della lett. it.

TORRIDONIAN, in geology, a series of pre-Cambrian are- 
naceous sediments extensively developed in the north-west high- 
lands of Scotland and particularly in the neighbourhood of upper 
Loch Torridon, a circumstance which suggested the name 
Torridon Sandstone, first applied to these rocks by J. Nicol. 
The rocks are mainly red and chocolate sandstones, arkoses, 
flagstones and shales with coarse conglomerates locally at the 
base. Some of the materials of these rocks were derived from 
the underlying Lewisian gneiss, upon the uneven surface of 
which they rest; but the bulk of the material was obtained 
from rocks that are nowhere now exposed. Upon this ancient 
denuded land surface the Torridonian strata rest horizontally 
or with gentle inclination. Their outcrop extends in a belt of 
variable breadth from Cape Wrath to the Point of Sleet in Skye, 
running in a N.N.E.-S.S.W. direction through Ross-shire and 
Sutherlandshire. They form the isolated mountain peaks of 
Canisp, Quinag and Suilven in the neighbourhood of Loch 
Assynt, of Slioch near Loch Maree and other hills. They attain 
their maximum development in the Applecross, Gairloch and 
Torridon districts, form the greater part of Scalpay, and occur 
also in Rum, Raasay, Soay and the Crowlin Islands. The 
Torridonian rocks have been subdivided into three groups: an 
upper Aultbea group, 3000-5000 ft.; a middle or Applecross 
group, 6000-8000 ft.; and a lower or Diabeg group, 500 ft. in 
Gairloch but reaching a thickness of 7200 ft. in Skye.

of Scotland," Mem. Geol. Survey (Glasgow, 1907). (J. A. H.) 

TORRIGIANO, PIETRO (1472-1522), Florentine sculptor, 
was, according to Vasari, one of the group of talented youths 
who studied art under the patronage of Lorenzo the Magnificent 
in Florence. Benvenuto Cellini, reporting a conversation with 
Torrigiano, relates that he and Michelangelo, while both young, 
were copying the frescoes in the Carmine chapel, when some 
slighting remark made by Michelangelo so enraged Torrigiano 
that he struck him on the nose, and thus caused that disfigure- 
ment which is so conspicuous in all the portraits of Michelangelo. 
Soon after this Torrigiano visited Rome, and helped Pintu- 
ricchio in modelling the elaborate stucco decorations in the 



Apartamenti Borgia for Alexander VI. After some time spent as a 
hired soldier in the service of different states, Torrigiano was 
invited to England to execute the magnificent tomb for Henry 
VII. and his queen, which still exists in the lady chapel of West- 
minster Abbey. This appears to have been begun before the 
death of Henry VII. in 1509J but was not finished till 1517. 
The two effigies are well modelled, and have lifelike but not 
too realistic portraits. After this Torrigiano received the com- 
mission for the altar, retable and baldacchino which stood at 
the west, outside the screen of Henry VII.'s tomb. The altar 
had marble pilasters at the angles, two of which still exist, and 
below the tnensa was a life-sized figure of the dead Christ in 
painted terra-cotta. The retable consisted of a large relief of 
the Resurrection. The baldacchino was of marble, with enrich- 
ments of gilt bronze; part of its frieze still exists, as do also a 
large number of fragments of the terra-cotta angels which sur- 
mounted the baldacchino and parts of the large figure of Christ. 
The whole of this work was destroyed by the Puritans in the 1 7th 
century. 1 Henry VIII. also commissioned Torrigiano to make 
him a magnificent tomb, somewhat similar to that of Henry 
VII., but one-fourth larger, to be placed in a chapel at Windsor; 
it was, however, never completed, and its rich bronze was melted 
by the Commonwealth, together with that of Wolsey's tomb. 
The indentures for these various works still exist, and are printed 
by Neale, Westminster Abbey, i. 54-59 (London, 1818). These 
interesting documents are written in English, and in them 
the Florentine is called " Peter Torrysany." For Henry VII/s 
tomb he contracted to receive £1500, for the altar and its fit- 
tings £1000, and £2000 for Henry VIIL's tomb. Other works 
attributed from internal evidence to Torrigiano are the tomb 
of Margaret of Richmond, mother of Henry VII., in the south 
aisle of his chapel, and a terra-cotta effigy in the chapel of the 
Rolls. 

While these royal works were going on Torrigiano visited 
Florence in order to get skilled assistants. He tried to induce 
Benvenuto Cellini to come to England to help him, but Cellini 
refused partly from his dislike to the brutal and swaggering 
manners of Torrigiano, and also because lie did not wish to 
live among " such beasts as the English." The latter part 
of Torrigiano's life was spent in Spain, especially at Seville, 
where, besides the painted figure of St Hieronymus in the 
museum, some terra-cotta sculpture by him still exists. His 
violent temper got him into difficulties with the authorities, 
and he ended his life in 1522 in the prisons of the Inquisition.

TORRINGTON, ARTHUR HERBERT, Earl of (1647- 
1716), British admiral, was the son of a judge, Sir Edward 
Herbert (c. 1 591-1657). He entered the navy in 1663, and served 
in the Dutch wars of the reign of Charles II., as well as against 
the Barbary pirates. From 1680 to 1683 he commanded in 
the Mediterranean. His career had been honourable, and he 
had been wounded in action. The known Royalist sentiments 
of his family combined with his reputation as a naval officer to 
point him out to the favour of the king, and James II. appointed 
him rear-admiral of England and master of the robes. The 
king no doubt counted on his support of the repeal of the Test 
Acts, as the admiral was member for Dover. Herbert refused, 
and was dismissed from his places. He now entered into com- 
munication with the agents of the prince of Orange, and promised 
to use his influence with the fleet to forward a revolution. 
After the acquittal of the seven bishops in 1688 he carried the 
invitation to William of Orange. The Revolution brought him 
ample amends for his losses. He was named first lord, and took 
the command of the fleet at home. In 1689 he was at sea 
attempting to prevent the French admiral Chateau-Renault 
(q.v.) from landing the troops sent by the king of France to the 
aid of King James in Ireland. Though he fought an action with 

1 An old drawing still exists showing this elaborate work; it is 
engraved in the Hierurgia anglicana, p. 267 (London, 1848). Many 
hundreds of fragments of this terra-cotta sculpture were found a 
few years ago hidden under the floor of the triforium in the abbey; 
they are unfortunately too much broken and imperfect to be fitted 
together.

the French in Bantry Bay on the 10th of May he failed to baffle 
Chateau-Renault, who had a stronger force. Being discontented 
with the amount of force provided at sea, he resigned his place 
at the admiralty, but retained his command at sea. In May 
1689 he was created earl of Torrington. In 1690 he was in the 
Channel with a fleet of English and Dutch vessels, which did 
not rise above 56 in all, and found himself in front of the much 
more powerful French fleet. In his report to the council of 
regency he indicated his intention of retiring to the Thames, and 
losing sight of the enemy, saying that they would not do any 
harm to the coast while they knew his fleet to be " in being." 
The council, which knew that the Jacobites were preparing for 
a rising, and only waited for the support of a body of French 
troops, ordered him not to lose sight of the enemy, but rather 
than do that to give battle" upon any advantage of the wind." 
On the 10th of July Torrington, after consulting with his Dutch 
colleagues, made a half-hearted attack on the French off Beachy 
Head in which his own ship was kept out of fire, and severe 
loss fell on his allies. Then he retired to the Thames. The 
French pursuit was fortunately feeble (see Tourville, Comte 
de) and the loss of the allies was comparatively slight. The 
indignation of the country was at first great, and Torrington 
was brought to a court martial in December. He was acquitted, 
but never again employed. Although twice married, he was 
childless when he died on the 14th of April 1716, his earldom 
becoming extinct. The unfavourable account of his moral 
character given by Dartmouth to Pepys is confirmed by Bishop 
Burnet, who had seen much of him during his exile in Holland. 
An attempt has been made in recent years to rehabilitate the 
character of Torrington, and his phrase " a fleet in being " has 
been widely used (see Naval Warfare, by Vice-Admiral P. H. 
Colomb). 

See Charnock's Biog. Nov., i. 258. The best account of the^ battle 
of Beachy Head is to be found in " The Account given by Sir John 
Ashby Vice-Admiral and Rear-Admiral Rooke, to the Lords Com- 
missioners " (1691). 

TORRINGTON, GEORGE BYNG, Viscount (1663-1733), 
English admiral, was born at Wrotham, Kent. His father, 
John Byng, was compelled by pecuniary losses to sell his property 
and his son entered the navy as a king's letter boy (see Navy) 
in 1678. He served in a ship stationed at Tangier, and for a 
time left the navy to enter one of the regiments of the garrison, 
but in 1683 he returned to the navy as lieutenant, and went to 
the East Indies in the following year. During the year 1688, 
he had an active share in bringing the fleet over to the prince 
of Orange, and by the success of the revolution his fortune was 
made. In 1702 he was appointed to the command of the 
" Nassau," and was at the taking and burning of the French 
fleet at . Vigo, and the next year he was made rear-admiral of 
the red. In 1704 he served in the Mediterranean under Sir 
Cloudesley Shovel, and reduced Gibraltar. He was in the battle 
of Malaga, and for his gallantry received the honour of knight- 
hood. In 1708 as admiral of the blue he commanded the 
squadron which baffled the attempt of the Old Pretender to land 
in Scotland. In 1 718 he commanded the fleet which defeated the 
Spaniards off Cape Passaro and compelled them to withdraw from 
their invasion of Sicily. This commission he executed so well 
that the king made him a handsome present and sent him full 
powers to negotiate with the princes and states of Italy. Byng 
procured for the emperor's troops free access into the fortresses 
which still held out in Sicily, sailed afterwards to Malta, and 
brought out the Sicilian galleys and a ship belonging to the 
Turkey Company. By his advice and assistance the Germans 
retook the city of Messina in 1719, and destroyed the ships which 
lay in the basin — an achievement which completed the ruin 
of the naval power of Spain. To his conduct it was entirely 
owing that Sicily was subdued and the king of Spain forced to 
accept the terms prescribed him by the quadruple alliance. 
On his return to England in 1721 he was made rear-admiral 
of Great Britain, a member of the privy council, Baron Byng 
of Southill, in the county of Bedford and Viscount Torrington 
in Devonshire. He was also made one of the Knights Com- 



panions of the Bath upon the revival of that order in 1725. 
In 1727 George II. on his accession made him first lord of the 
admiralty, and his administration was distinguished by the 
establishment of the Royal Naval College at Portsmouth. He 
died on the 17th of January 1733, and was buried at Southill, 
in Bedfordshire. Two of his eleven sons, Pattee (1699-1747) 
and George (1701-1750), became respectively the 2nd and 3rd 
viscounts. The title is still held by the descendants of the 
latter. 

See Memoirs relating to Lord Torrington, Camden Soc., new series 
46, and A True Account of the Expedition of the British Fleet to Sicily 
1718-1720, published anonymously, but known to be by Thomas 
Corbett of the admiralty in 1739. Forbin's Memoirs contain 
the French side of the expedition to Scotland in 1708. 

TORRINGTON, a borough of Litchfield county, Connecticut, 
U.S.A., in the township of Torrington, on the Naugatuck river, 
about 25 m. W. of Hartford. Pop. (1900), 8360, of whom 2565 
were foreign-born; (1910) 15483; of the township, including the 
borough (1900) 12,453; (1910) 16,840. It is served by the New 
York, New Haven & Hartford railway and by an electric line con- 
necting with Winsted. It has a public library (1865) with 15,000 
volumes in 1909. There is a state armoury in the borough. 
Torrington is a prosperous manufacturing centre. In 1905 the 
value of the factory product was $9,674,124. The township 
of Torrington, originally a part of the township of Windsor, 
was first settled in 1734, and was separately incorporated in 
1740. The site was covered by pine trees, which were much 
used for ship-building, and for this reason it was known as 
Mast Swamp. ' In 1751 a mill was erected, but there were few, 
if any, residences until 1800. In 1806 the settlement was known 
as New Orleans village. In 1813 members of the Wolcott family 
of Litchfield, impressed with the water-power, bought land and 
built a woollen mill, and the village that soon developed was 
called Wolcottville. Its growth was slow until 1864. In 1881 
its name was changed to Torrington, and in 1887 the borough 
was incorporated.

article, " The Growth of Torrington," in the Connecticut Magazine, 
vol. ix., No. 1. 

TORRINGTON (Great Torrington), a market town and 
municipal borough in the South Molton parliamentary division 
of Devonshire, England, on the Torridge, 225 m. W. by S. of 
London by the London & South-Western railway. Pop. 
(1901), 3241. It stands on a hill overlooking the richly wooded 
valley of the Torridge, here crossed by three bridges. Glove 
manufactures on a large scale, with flour and butter making 
and leather dressing, are the staple industries. The town is 
governed by a mayor, 4 aldermen and 12 councillors. Area, 
3592 acres. 

Torrington {Toritone) was the site of very early settlement, 
and possessed a market in Saxon times. The manor was held 
by Brictric in the reign of Edward the Confessor, and in 1086 
formed part of the Domesday fief of Odo Fitz Gamelin, which 
later constituted an honour with Torrington as its caput. In 
1 221 it appears as a mesne borough under William de Toritone, 
a descendant of Odo and the supposed founder of the castle, 
which in 1228 was ordered to be razed to the ground, but is 
said to have been rebuilt in 1340 by Richard de Merton. The 
borough had a fair in 1221, and returned two members to parlia- 
ment from 1295 until exempted from representation at its own 
request in 1368. The government was vested in bailiffs and 
a commonalty, and no charter of incorporation was granted 
till that of Queen Mary in 1554, which instituted a governing 
body of a mayor, 7 aldermen and 18 chief burgesses, with 
authority to hold a court of record every three weeks on 
Monday, law-days and view of frankpledge at Michaelmas and 
Easter; a weekly market on Saturday, and fairs at the feasts 
of St Michael and St George. This charter was confirmed by 
Elizabeth in 1568 and by James I. in 161 7. A charter from 
James II. in 1686 changed the style of the corporation to a 
mayor, 8 aldermen and 12 chief burgesses. In the 16th century 
Torrington was an important centre of the clothing trade, and 
in 1605 the town is described as very prosperous, with three

fairs, and a great market " furnished from far on every quarter, 
being the most convenient place for occasions of king or county 
in those parts." The Saturday market is still maintained, but 
the fairs have been altered to the third Saturday in March and 
the first Thursday in May. In 1643 Colonel Digby took up 
his position at Torrington and put to flight a contingent of 
parliamentary troops; but in 1646 the town was besieged by Sir 
Thomas Fairfax and finally forced to surrender. The borough 
records were destroyed by fire in 1724.

of Great Torrington (1878). 

TORSTENSSON, LENNART, Count (1603-1651), Swedish 
soldier, son of Torsten Lenhartsson, commandant of Elfsborg, 
was born at Forstena in Vestergotland. At the age of fifteen 
he became one of the pages of the young Gustavus Adolphus 
and served during the Prussian campaigns of 1628-29. In 
1629 he was set over the Swedish artillery, which under his 
guidance materially contributed to the victories of Breitenfeld 
(1631) and Lech (1632). The same year he was taken prisoner 
at Alte Veste and shut up for nearly a year at Ingolstadt. 
Under Baner he rendered distinguished service at the battle of 
Wittstock (1636) and during the energetic defence of Pomerania 
in 1637-38, as well as at the battle of Chemnitz (1638) and in 
the raid into Bohemia in 1639. Illness compelled him to return 
to Sweden in 1641, when he was made a senator. The sudden 
death of Baner in May 1641 recalled Torstensson to Germany 
as generalissimo of the Swedish forces and governor-general of 
Pomerania. He was at the same time promoted to the rank 
of field marshal. The period of his command (1641-1645) 
forms one of the most brilliant chapters in the military history 
of Sweden. In 1642 he marched through Brandenburg and 
Silesia into Moravia, taking all the principal fortresses on his 
way. On returning through Saxony he well nigh annihilated 
the imperialist army at the second battle of Breitenfeld 
(Oct. 23, 1642). In 1643 he invaded Moravia for the second 
time, but was suddenly recalled to invade Denmark, when his 
rapid and unexpected intervention paralysed the Danish 
defence on the land side, though Torstensson's own position in 
Jutland was for a time precarious owing to the skilful handling 
of the Danish fleet by Christian IV. In 1644 he led his army 
for the third time into the heart of Germany and routed 
the imperialists at Jiiterbog (Nov. 23). At the beginning 
of November 1645 he broke into Bohemia, and the brilliant 
victory of Jankow (Feb. 24, 1645) laid open before him the 
road to Vienna. Yet, though one end of the Danube bridge 
actually fell into his hands, his exhausted army was unable to 
penetrate any farther and, in December the same year, Tor- 
stensson, crippled by gout, was forced to resign his command 
and return to Sweden. In 1647 ne was created a count. From 
1648 to 165 1 he ruled all the western provinces of Sweden, as 
governor-general. On his death at Stockholm (April 7, 
1651) he was buried solemnly in the Riddarholmskyrka, the 
Pantheon of Sweden. Torstensson was remarkable for the 
extraordinary and incalculable rapidity of his movements, 
though very frequently he had to lead the army in a litter, as 
his bodily infirmities would not permit him to mount his horse. 
He was also the most scientific artillery officer and the best and 
most successful engineer in the Swedish army. 

His son, Senator Count Anders Torstensson (164 1-1686), 
was from 1674 to 1681 governor-general of Esthonia. The 
family became extinct on the sword-side in 1727.

TORT (Fr. for wrong, from Lat. tortus, twisted, participle 
of torquere), the technical term, in the law of England, of those 
dominions and possessions of the British Empire where the 
common law has been received or practically adopted in civil 
affairs, and of the United States, for a civil wrong, i.e. the 
breach of a duty imposed by law, by which breach some person 
becomes entitled to sue for damages. A tort must, on the 



one hand, be an act which violates a general duty. The rule 
which it breaks must be one made by the law, not, as in the 
case of a mere breach of contract, a rule which the law protects 
because the parties have made it for themselves. On the other 
hand, a tort is essentially the source of a private right of action. 
An offence which is punishable, but for which no one can bring 
a civil action, is not a tort. It is quite possible for one and the 
same act to be a tort and a breach of contract, or a tort and a 
crime; it is even possible in one class of cases for the plaintiff 
to have the option — for purposes of procedural advantage — of 
treating a real tort as a fictitious contract; but there is no 
necessary or general connexion. Again, it is not the case that 
pecuniary damages are always or necessarily the only remedy 
for a tort; but the right to bring an action in common law juris- 
diction, as distinct from equity, matrimonial or admiralty 
jurisdiction, with the consequent right to damages, is invariably 
present where a tort has been committed. 

This technical use of the French word tort (which at one 
time was near becoming a synonym of wrong in literary 
English) is not very ancient, and anything like systematic 
treatment of the subject as a whole is very modern. Since 
about the middle of the 19th century there has been a current 
assumption that all civil causes of action must be founded on 
either contract or tort; but there is no historical foundation for 
this doctrine, though modified forms of the action of trespass — 
actions in consimili casu, or " on the case " in the accustomed 
English phrase — did in practice largely supplant other more 
archaic forms of action by reason of their greater convenience. 
The old forms were designed as penal remedies for manifest 
breach of the peace or corruption of justice; and traces of the 
penal element remained in them long after the substance of the 
procedure had become private and merely civil. The transition 
belongs to the general history of English law. 

In England the general scope of the law of torts has never 
been formulated by authority, the law having in fact been 
developed by a series of disconnected experiments with the 
various forms of action which seemed from time to time to 
promise the widest and most useful remedies. But there is 
no doubt that the duties enforced by the English law of torts 
are broadly those which the Roman institutional writers summed 
up in the precept Alterum non laedere. Every member of a 
civilized commonwealth is entitled to require of others a certain 
amount of respect for his person, reputation and property, 
and a certain amount of care and caution when they go about 
undertakings attended with risk to their neighbours. Under 
the modern law, it is submitted, the question arising when one 
man wilfully or recklessly harms another is not whether some 
technical form of action can be found in which he is liable, but 
whether he can justify or excuse himself. This view, at any rate, 
is countenanced by a judgment of the Supreme Court of the 
United States delivered in 1904. If it be right, the controverted 
question whether conspiracy is or is not a substantive cause 
of action seems to lose most of its importance. Instead of the 
doubtful proposition of law that some injuries become unlawful 
only when inflicted by concerted action, we shall have the plain 
proposition of fact that some kinds of injury cannot, as a rule, 
be inflicted by one person with such effect as to produce any 
damage worth suing for. 

The precise amount of responsibility can be determined only 
by full consideration in each class of cases. It is important to 
observe, however, that a law of responsibility confined to a man's 
own personal acts and defaults would be of next to no practical 
use under the conditions of modern society. What makes the 
law of torts really effective, especially with regard to redress 
for harm suffered by negligence, is the universal rule of law that 
every one is answerable for the acts and defaults of his servants 
(that is, all persons acting under his direction and taking their 
orders from him or some one representing him) in the cpurse of 
their employment. The person actually in fault is not the less 
answerable, but the remedy against him is very commonly not 
worth pursuing. But for this rule corporations could not be 
liable for any negligence of their servants, however disastrous

to innocent persons, except so far as it might happen to constitute 
a breach of some express undertaking. We have spoken of the 
rule as universal, but, in the case of one servant of the same 
employer being injured by the default of another, an unfortunate 
aberration of the courts, which started about two generations 
ago from small beginnings, was pushed to extreme results, 
and led to great hardship. A partial remedy was applied in 
1880 by the Employers' Liability Act; and in 1897 a much bolder 
step was taken by the Workmen's Compensation Act (super- 
seded by a more comprehensive act in 1906). But, as the 
common law and the two acts (which proceed on entirely 
different principles) cover different fields, with a good deal of 
overlapping, and the acts are full of complicated provisos and 
exceptions, and, contain very special provisions as to procedure, 
the improvement in substantial justice has been bought, so 
far, at the price of great confusion in the form of the law, and 
considerable difficulty in ascertaining what it is in any but 
the most obvious cases. The Workmen's Compensation Act 
includes cases of pure accident, where there is no fault at all, 
or none that can be proved, and therefore goes beyond the 
reasons of liability with which the law of torts has to do. In 
fact, it establishes a kind of compulsory insurance, which can 
be justified only on wider grounds of policy. A novel and 
extraordinary exception to the rule of responsibility for 
agents was made in the case of trade combinations by the 
Trade Disputes Act 1906. This has no interest for law as 
a science. 

There are kinds of cases, on the other hand, in 'which the law, 
without aid from legislation, has imposed on occupiers and other 
persons in analogous positions a duty stricter than that of 
being answerable for themselves and their servants. Duties 
of this kind have been called " duties of insuring safety." Gene- 
rally they extend to having the building, structure, or works in 
such order, having regard to the nature of the case, as not 
to create any danger to persons lawfully frequenting, using, or 
passing by them, which the exercise of reasonable care and skill 
could have avoided; but in some cases of "extra-hazardous " 
risk, even proof of all possible diligence — according to English 
authority, which is not unanimously accepted in America — will 
not suffice. There has lately been a notable tendency to extend 
these principles to the duties incurred towards the public by 
local authorities who undertake public works. Positive duties 
created by statute are on a similar footing, so far as the breach 
of them is capable of giving rise to any private right of 
action. 

The classification of actionable wrongs is perplexing, not 
because it is difficult to find a scheme of division, but because it is 
easier to find many than to adhere to any one of them. We may 
start either from the character of the defendant's act or omission, 
with regard to his knowledge, intention and otherwise; or from 
the character of the harm suffered by the plaintiff. Whichever 
of these we take as the primary line of distinction, the results can 
seldom be worked out without calling in the other. Taking 
first the defendant's position, the widest governing principle is 
that, apart from various recognized grounds of immunity, a 
man is answerable for the " natural and probable " consequences 
of his acts; i.e. such consequences as a reasonable man in his 
place should have foreseen as probable. Still more is he answer- 
able for what he did actually foresee and intend. Knowledge 
of particular facts may be necessary to make particular kinds 
of conduct wrongful. Such is the rule in the case of fraud and 
other allied wrongs, including what is rather unhappily called 
" slander of title," and what is now known as " unfair com- 
petition " in the matter of trade names and descriptions, short 
of actual piracy of trade-marks. But where an absolute right 
to security for a man's person, reputation or goods is interfered 
with, neither knowledge nor specific intention need be proved. 
In these cases we trespass altogether at our peril. It is in 
general the habit of the law to judge acts by their apparent 
tendency, and not by the actor's feelings or desires. I cannot 
excuse myself by good motives for infringing another man's 
rights, whatever other grounds of excuse may be available; 
xxvii. 3 



and it is now settled conversely, though after much doubt, 
that an act not otherwise unlawful is not, as a rule, made 
unlawful by being done from an evil motive. This rule was 
known some time ago to apply to the exercise of rights of 
property, and such speculative doubt as remained was removed 
by the decision of the House of Lords in the leading case of 
Allen v. Flood (1898, A.C. 1). We now know that it applies to 
the exercise of all common rights. The exceptions are very 
few, and must be explained by exceptional reasons. Indeed, 
only two are known to the present writer — malicious prose- 
cution, and the misuse of a " privileged occasion " which would 
justify the communication of defamatory matter if made in good 
faith. In each case the wrong lies in the deliberate perversion 
of a right or privilege allowed for the public good, though the 
precise extent of the analogy is not certain at present. 1 It 
must be remembered, however, that the presence or absence 
of personal ill will, and the behaviour of the parties generally, 
may have an important effect, when liability is proved or 
admitted, in mitigating or aggravating the amount of 
damages awarded by juries and allowed by the court to be 
reasonable. It may likewise be noted, by way of caution, that 
some problems of criminal law, with which we are not here 
concerned, require more subtle consideration. However, it is 
hardly ever safe to assume that the bounds of civil and criminal 
liability will be found coextensive. Perhaps we may go so far 
as to say that a man is neither civilly nor criminally liable for a 
mere omission (not being disobedience to a lawful command 
which he was bound to obey), unless he has in some way assumed 
a special duty of doing the act omitted. 

We have already had to mention the existence of grounds 
of immunity for acts that would otherwise be wrongful. Such 
grounds there must be if the law is to be enforced and justice 
administered at all, and if the business of life, is to be carried 
on with any freedom. Roughly speaking, we find in these 
cases one of the following conditions: Either the defendant 
was executing a lawful authority; or he was justified by 
extraordinary necessity; or he was doing something permitted 
by legislation for reasons of superior utility, though it may 
produce damage to others, and either with or without special 
provisions for compensating damage; or he was exercising a 
common right in matters open to free use and competition; 
or the plaintiff had, by consent or otherwise, disabled himself 
from having any grievance. Pure accident will hardly seem to 
any one who is not a lawyer to be a special ground of exemption, 
the question being rather how it could ever be supposed to be a 
ground of liability. But it was supposed so by many lawyers 
down to recent times; the reason lying in a history of archaic 
ideas too long to be traced here. Exercise of common rights 
is the category where most difficulty arises. Here, in fact, 
the point at which a man's freedom is limited by his neighbour's 
has to be fixed by a sense of policy not capable of formal 
demonstration. 

As Justice Holmes of the Supreme Court of the United States 
has said, we allow unlimited trade competition (so long as it is 
without fraud) though we know that many traders must suffer, 
and some may be ruined by it, because we hold that free com- 
petition is worth more to society than its costs. A state with 
different economic foundations might have a different law on this, 
as on many other points. This freedom extends not only to the 
exercise of one's calling, but to choosing with whom and under 
what conditions one will exercise it. Also the law will not inquire 
with what motives a common right is exercised ; and this applies 
to the ordinary rights of an owner in the use of his property 

1 It was formerly supposed that an action by a party to a con- 
tract against a third person for procuring the other party to break 
his contract was within the same class, i.e. that malice must be 
proved. But since Allen v. Flood, and the later decision of the 
House of Lords in Quinn v. Leathern (1901, A.C. 495), this view 
seems untenable. The ground of action is the intentional violation 
of an existing legal righ t ; which , however, si nee 1 906 , may 
be practised with impunity in the United Kingdom " in 
contemplation or furtherance of a trade dispute": Trade 
Disputes Act, § 3.

as well as to the right of every man to carry on his business. 1 
Owners and occupiers of immovable property are bound, indeed, 
to respect one another's convenience within certain limits. 
The maxim or precept Sic utere tuo ut alienum non laedas does 
not mean that I must not use my land in any way which can 
possibly diminish the profit or amenity of my neighbour's. 
That would be false. It is a warning that both his rights and 
mine extend beyond being free from actual unlawful entry, 
and that if either of us takes too literally the more popular but 
even less accurate maxim, " Every man may do as he will with his 
own," he will find that there is such a head of the law as nuisance. 

From the point of view of the plaintiff, as regards the kind of 
damage suffered by him, actionable wrongs may be divided 
into four groups. We have some of a strictly personal kind; 
some which affect ownership and rights analogous to owner- 
ship; some which extend to the safety, convenience and profit of 
life generally — in short, to a man's estate in the widest sense; 
and some which may, according to circumstances, result in 
damage to person, property or estate, any or all of them. Per- 
sonal wrongs touching a man's body or honour are assault, false 
imprisonment, seduction or " enticing away " of members of 
his family. Wrongs to property are trespass to land or goods, 
" conversion " of goods (*.e. wrongful assumption of dominion 
over them), disturbance of easements and other individual 
rights in property not amounting to exclusive possession. Tres- 
pass is essentially a wrong to possession; but with the aid of 
actions " on the case " the ground has been practically covered. 
Then there are infringements of incorporeal rights which, though 
not the subject of trespass proper, are exclusive rights of 
enjoyment and have many incidents of ownership. Actions, 
in some cases expressly given by statute, he for the piracy of 
copyright, patents and trade marks. Wrongs to a man's estate 
in the larger sense above noted are defamation (not a strictly 
personal wrong, because according to English common law the 
temporal damage, not the insult, is, rightly or wrongly, made 
the ground of action); deceit, so-called "slander of title" 
and fraudulent trade competition, which are really varieties 
of deceit; malicious prosecution; and nuisance, which, though 
most important as affecting the enjoyment of property, is not 
considered in that relation only. Finally, we have the results of 
negligence and omission to perform special duties regarding 
the safety of one's neighbours or customers, or of the public, 
which may affect person, property, or estate generally. 

The law of wrongs is made to do a great deal of work which, 
in a system less dependent on historical conditions, we should 
expect to find done by the law of property. We can claim or 
reclaim our movable goods only by complaining of a wrong 
done to our possession or our right to possess. There is no 
direct assertion of ownership like the Roman vindicatio. The 
law of negligence, with the refined discussions of the test and 
measure of liability which it has introduced, is wholly modern; 
and the same may be said of the present working law of nuisance, 

t 1 The rule that a man's motives for exercising his common 
rights are not examinable involves the consequence that advising 
or procuring another, who is a free agent, to do an act of this kind 
can, a fortiori, not be an actionable wrong at the suit of a third 
person who is damnified by the act, and that whatever the adviser's 
motives may be. This appears to be included in the decision of 
the House of Lords in Allen v. Flood, That decision, though not 
binding in any American court, is approved and followed in most 
American jurisdictions. It is otherwise where a system of coercion 
is exercised on a man's workmen or customers in order to injure 
him in his business. The extension of immunity to such conduct 
would destroy the value of the common right which the law pro- 
tects: Quinn v. Leathern. The coercion need not be physical, and 
the wrong as a whole may be made up of acts none of which taken 
alone would Jbe a cause of action. In this point there is nothing 
novel, for it is so in almost every case of nuisance. Conspiracy is 
naturally a frequent dement in such cases, but it does not appear 
to be necessary; if it were, millionaires and corporations might 
exceed the bounds of lawful competition with impunity whenever 
they were strong enough. The reasons given in Quinn v. Leathern 
are many and various, but the decision is quite consistent with 
Allen v. Flood. However, the Trade Disputes Act will probably have 
its intended effect of reducing the law on this head to relative 
insignificance in England. 



though the term is of respectable antiquity. Most recent of all 
is the rubric of " unfair competition," which is fast acquiring 
great importance. 

It will be observed that the English law of torts answers 
approximately in its purpose and contents to the Roman law 
of obligations ex delicto and- quasi ex delicto. When we have 
allowed for the peculiar treatment of rights of property in the 
common law, and remembered that, according to one plausible 
theory, the Roman law of possession itself is closely connected 
in its origin with the law of delicts, we shall find the corre- 
spondence at least as close as might be expected a priori. Nor 
is the correspondence to be explained by borrowing, for this 
branch of the common law seems to owe less to the classical 
Roman or medieval canon law than any other. Some few 
misunderstood Roman maxims have done considerable harm in 
detail, but the principles have been worked out in all but 
complete independence. 

A list of modern books and monographs will be found at the 
end of the article on " Torts " by the present writer in the Encyclo- 
paedia of the Laws of England (2nd ed.). Among recent editions 
of works on the law of torts and new publications the following may 
be mentioned here: Addison, by W. E. Gordon and W. H. Griffith 
(8th ed., 1906); Clerk and Lindsell, by Wyatt Paine (4th ed., 
1906); Pollock (8th ed., 1908); Salmond, The Law of Torts (2nd ed. ( 
1910). In America: Burdick, The Law of Torts (1905); Street, The 
Foundations of Legal Liability (1906), 3 vols, of which vol. i. is

TORTOISE. Of the three names generally used for this order 
of reptiles, viz* tortoise, turtle and terrapin, the first is derived 
from the Old French word iortisj i.e. twisted, and was probably 
applied first to the common European species on account of 
its curiously bent forelegs. Turtle is believed to be a corruption 
of the same word, but the origin of the name terrapin is un- 
known: since the time of the navigators of the 16th century it 
has been in general use for fresh-water species of the tropics, 
and especially for those of the New World. The name tortoise 
is now generally applied to the terrestrial members of this group 
of animals, and that of turtle to those which live in the sea or 
pass a great part of their existence in fresh water. They consti- 
tute one of the orders of reptiles, the Chelonia: toothless reptiles, 
with well developed limbs, with a dorsal and a ventral shell 
composed of numerous bony plates, large firmly fixed quadrates, 
a longitudinal anal opening and an unpaired copulatory organ. 

The whole shell consists of the dorsal, more or less convex carapace 
and the ventral plastron, both portions being joined laterally by 
the so-called bridge. The carapace is (with the exception of 
Sphargis) formed by dermal ossifications which are arranged in 
regular series, viz. a median row (1 nuchal, mostly 8 neurals and 
1-3 supracaudal or pygal plates), a right and left row of costal 
plates which surround and partly replace the ribs, and a consider- 
able number (about 11 pairs) of marginal plates. The plas- 
tron consists of usually 9, rarely n, dermal bones, viz. paired 
epi-, hyo-, hypo- and xiphi-plastral plates and the unpaired 
endo-plastral ; the latter is homologous with the interclavicle, the 
epi-plastra with the clavicles, the rest with so-called abdominal 
ribs of other reptiles. 

In most Chelonians the bony shell is covered with a hard epi- 
dermal coat, which is divided into large shields, commonly called 
11 tortoiseshell." These horny shields or scutes do not correspond 
in numbers and extent with the underlying bones, although there 
is a general, vague resemblance in their arrangement; for instance, 
there is a neural, a paired costal and a paired marginal series. 
The^ terminology may be learned from the accompanying illus- 
trations (figs. 1 and 2). * 

The integuments of the head, neck, tail and limbs arc either 
soft and smooth or scaly or tubercular, frequently with small osseous 
nuclei. 

All the bones of the skull are suturally^ united. The dentary 

Cortion of the mandible consists of one piece only, both halves 
eing completely fused together. The pectoral arch remains 
separate in the median line; it consists of the coracoids, which slope 
backwards, and the scapulae, which stand upright and often abut 
against the inside of the first pair of costal plates. Near the glenoid 
cavity for the humerus arises from the scapula a long process which 
is directed transversely towards its fellow; it represents the acromial 
process of other vertebrates, although so much enlarged, and is 
neither the precoracoid, nor the clavicle, as stated by the thought- 
less. The tail is still best developed in the Chelydridae, shortest in 
the Trionychoidea. Since it contains the large copulatory organ, 
it is less reduced in the males. No Chelonians possess the slightest

traces of teeth, but their jaws arc provided with horny sheaths, with 
hard and sharp edges, forming a beak. 

The number of Chelonians known at present may be estimated 
at about 200, the fresh-water species being far the most numerous, 
and are abundant in well-watered districts of the tropical and 
sub-tropical zones. Their number and variety decrease beyond 
the tropics, and in the north they disappear entirely about the 
50th parallel in the western and about the 56th in the eastern 
hemisphere, whilst in the southern hemisphere the terrestrial 
forms seem to advance to 36°,S. only. The marine turtles, 
which are spread over the whole of the equatorial and sub-tropical 
seas, sometimes stray beyond those limits. As in other orders

of reptiles, the most specialized and the largest forms are 
restricted to the tropics (with the exception of Macroclemmys) ; 
but, unlike lizards or snakes, Chelonians are unable to exist in 
sterile districts or at great altitudes. 

They show a great divergence in their mode of life — some 
living constantly on land, others having partly terrestrial 
partly aquatic habits, others again rarely leaving the water 
or the sea. The first-mentioned, the land tortoises proper, have 
short club-shaped feet with blunt claws, and a very convex, 
heavy, completely ossified shell. In the fresh-water forms 
the joints of the limb bones are much more mobile, the digits 
distinct, armed with sharp claws, and united by a membrane 



or web; their shell is less convex, and is flattened, and more 
or less extensive areas may remain unossified, or transparent 
windows are formed with age, for instance in Batagur, As a 
rule, the degree of development of the interdigital web and of 
convexity of the shell indicates the prevalence of aquatic or 
terrestrial habits of a species of terrapin. Finally, the marine 
turtles have paddle-shaped limbs resembling those of Cetaceans. 

Land tortoises are sufficiently protected by their carapace, 
and therefore have no need of any special modification of 
structure by means of which their appearance would be assimi- 
lated to the surroundings and thus give them additional 
security from their enemies. These, however, are few in number. 
On the other hand, among the carnivorous terrapins and fresh- 
water turtles instances of protective resemblance are not 
scarce, and may even attain to a high degree of specialization, 
as in Chelys, the matamata. The colours of land tortoises are 
generally plain, or in yellow and brown patterns, whilst 
those of many terrapins are singularly varied, bright and 
beautiful, especially in the very young, but all this beauty is 
lost in the adult of many species. 

Chelonians are diurnal animals; only a few are active during 
the night, habitually or on special occasions, as, for instance, 
during oviposition. Land tortoises aTe slow in all their move- 
ments, but all kinds living in water can execute rapid motions, 
either to seize their . prey or to escape from danger. All 
Chelonians are stationary, residing throughout the year in 
the same locality, with the exception of the marine turtles, 
which periodically migrate to their breeding-stations. Species 
inhabiting temperate regions hibernate. 

Land tortoises, a few terrapins, and some of the marine 
turtles are herbivorous, the others carnivorous, their prey con- 
sisting chiefly of fish, frogs, molluscs, and other small aquatic 
animals; some, e.g. Clemmys insculpta and Cistudo Carolina, 
have a mixed vegetable and animal diet. 

All Chelonians are oviparous, and the eggs are generally covered 
with a hard shell, mostly elliptical, rarely quite round, as in the 
case of the marine turtles. The various modifications, and also 
the not uncommon individual variations, in the composition of 
the carapace plates and the number and disposition of the shields, 
are very significant. They show an unmistakable tendency 
towards reduction in numbers, a concentration and simplification 
of the shell and its covering shields. We can to a certain extent 
reconstruct a generalized ancestral tortoise and thereby narrow 
the wide gap which separates the Chelonia from every other reptilian 
order. The early Chelonians possessed most likely more than 
five longitudinal dorsal rows of plates. The presence of several 
small supramarginal shields in Macroclemmys may be an indication 
that the total number of longitudinal rows was originally at least 
seven. The number of transverserows, both of plates and shields, was 
also greater. We can account for at least twelve median plates and 
as many pairs of marginals, but for onlv eieht median and eight pairs 
of costal shields (individual variations observed in Thalassochelys). 
It stands to reason that originally each trunk metamere had its full 
complement of plates and shields; consequently that about twelve 
trunk metameres partook in the formation of the shell, which, 
with subsequent shortening and broadening ofthe trunk, has under- 
gone considerable concentration and reduction, a process which 
has reduced the costal plates to seven pairs in the American species 
of Trionyx, has completely abolished the neural plates of some 
Chelydidae, and has brought down the costal shields to four pairs in 
the majority of recent Chelonians. In several species of Testudo 
the little nuchal shield is suppressed, thereby reducing the unpaired 
median shields to five. The complete absence of shields in the Triony- 
chidae and in Carettochelys is also due to a secondary process, which, 
however, has proceeded in a different way. 

Classification of Chelonia. 
H. Stannius in 1854 clearly separated the Trionychoidea 
from the rest. E. D. Cope, in 1870, distinguished between 
Pleurodira and Cryptodira according to whether the neck, 
Seprj or 8eiprj y is bent sidewards, or hidden by being withdrawn 
in an S-shaped curve in a vertical plane; he also separated 
Sphargis as Athecae from all the other Chelonians, for which 
L. Dollo, in 1886, proposed the term Thecophora. These terms 
are most unfortunate, misleading. Athecae (from 6i)K7} } 
shell) has reference to the absence of a horny shell-covering in 
the leathery turtle; but since the same character applies to 
Trionychoidea and to Carettochelys, nobody can guess that

the term Athecae in Dollo's sense refers to the fact that the 
shell of the leathery turtle is not homologous, with the typical 
shell or Qtjktj of the other Chelonians. The grouping of the 
latter into families recognizable by chiefly internal, skeletal 
characters has been effected by G. A. Boulenger. For practical 
purposes the following " key *' is preferable to those taxonomic 
characters which are mentioned in the descriptions of the

Sub-order I. Athecae. — The shell consists of a mosaic of numerous 
small polygonal osseous plates and is covered with leathery skin 
without any horny shields. The limbs are transformed into paddles, 
without claws. Marine. Sole representative Sphargis or Derma- 
tochelys coriacea, the leathery turtle or luth ; it is the largest of living 
Chelonians, surpassing 6 ft. in length, has a wide 
distribution over all the intertropical seas, but 
is very rare everywhere; a few stragglers have 
appeared as far north as the coasts of Long 
Island, and those of Great Britain, Holland and 
France. It is a curious fact that only adults 
and young, but none of intermediate size, happen 
to be known. This creature shows many im- 
portant features. The vertebrae and ribs are 
not fused with, but remain free from, the cara- 
pace, and this is fundamentally different from 
and not homologous with that of other Chelon- 
ians. O. P. Hay has suggested that the mosaic 
polygonal components of the shelly of Sphargis 
are, so to speak, an earlier generation of osteo- 
dermal plates than the fewer and larger^ plates 
of the Thecophora, which in them fuse with the 
neural arches and the ribs. Sphargis has, how- 
ever, the later category in the plastron and in its first neural or nuchal 
plate. If this suggestion is correct, this turtle has either lost or 
perhaps never had developed the horny shields. The many mosaic 
plates comprise larger plates which form an unpaired median, 
two pairs ot other dorsal, a lateral and three pairs of ventral series 
or ridges; thirteen, or when the inner ventral pair fuses, twelve pairs 
in all. 

The skull, excellently studied by J. F. van Bemmelen, much 
resembles that of Chelone, but so-called epipterygoids are absent; 
further, the pterygoids, instead of sending lateral arms to the jugals 
and maxillaries, are widely separated from these bones by the 



palatines, and these do not at all ventrally roof over the choanae. 
The position of Sphargis in the system is still a moot question. 
G. A. Boulenger looks upon it as the sole remnant of a primitive 
group in opposition to all the other recent Chelonia; G. Baur con- 
sidered it the most specialized descendant of the Chelonidae, a

a certain extent by J. F. van Bemmelen. For literature, &c, 
see L. Dollo, Bull. 5. R. Bruxelles (Fevrier 4, 1901). 

Sub-order^ II. _ Thecophora. — The bony shell is composed of 
several longitudinal series of plates (on the dorsal side a median 
or neural, a paired lateral or costal series, and marginal plates). 
With few exceptions this shell is covered with large horny scutes 
or shields. 

Super-family 1. Cryptodira. — The neck, if retractile, bends in 
an S-shaped curve in a vertical plane. The pelvis is not fused 
with the shell, and this is covered with large horny shields, except 
in Carettochelys. 

Family 1. Chelydridae. — The plastron is rather narrow, and cross- 
shaped ; the bridge is very narrow and is covered by a pair of shields, 
the displaced abdominals, which are separated from the marginals 
by a few inframarginals. The limbs, neck and head are so stout 
that they cannot completely be withdrawn into the shell. The 
tail is very long. Only two genera with three species, confinedto 
America. Chelydra serpentina, the " snapping turtle," ranging 
from the Canadian lakes through the United States east^ of the 
Rockies; closely allied is C. rossignoni of Central America and 
Ecuador. Macroclemmys temmincki f the " alligator turtle/' is 
the largest known fresh- water Chelonian, its shell growing to a length

of 3 ft. It is characterized by the three series of strong prominent 
keels along the back; it inhabits the whole basin of the Mississippi 
and Missouri rivers. 

Family 2. Dermatemydidae. — The pectoral shields are widely 
separated from the marginals by inframarginals, the gulars are 
small or absent, and the tail is extremely short. Only a few species, 
in Central America. The plastron is composed of nine plates. 
The nuchal plate has a pair of rib-like processes like those of the 
Chelydridae. One or more of the posterior costal plates meet in 
the middle line. The shell of these aquatic, broadly web-fingered 
tortoises, is very flat and the covering shields are thin. They feed

upon leaves, grass and especially fruit. Staurotypus, e.g.' salvini 
with 23, Dermatemys, e.%. mawi, with 25 marginal shields. 

Family 3. Cinostermdae. — Closely allied to the two previous 
families from which Cinosternum, the only genus, differs chiefly 
by the absence of the endo-plastral plate. Inframarginals are 
present. The nuchal plate has a pair of rib-like processes. The 
neural plates are interrupted by the meeting of several pairs of the 
costal plates. Twenty-three marginal shields. In some species the 
skin of the legs and neck is so baggy that these parts slip in, the 
skin rolling off, when such a turtle withdraws into its shell. In 
some the plastron is hinged and the creature can shut itself up tightly, 
e.g. C. leucostoma of Mexico; in others the plastron leaves gaps, 
or it is narrow and without hinges, e.g. C. odoratum, the mud turtle 
or stinkpot terrapin of the eastern half of North America. About 
a dozen species, mostly Central American. 

Family 4. Platysternidae. — Platysternum megaceplialum, the only 
species, from Burma to southern China.^ The total length of these 
thick-headed, very long-tailed turtles is about 1 ft., only 5 in. 
belonging to the shell. The plastron is large, oblong, not cruci- 
form, composed of nine plates. The nuchal is devoid of rib-like 
processes. A unique arrangement is that the jugals are completely 
shut off from the orbits owing to the meeting of the post-frontals 
with the maxillaries. 

Family 5. Testudinidae. — The shell is always covered with well- 
developed shields; those which cover the plastral bridge are in 
direct contact with the marginals. The plastron is composed 
of nine bones. The digits have four or five claws. The neck is 
completely retractile. 

This family contains the majority of tortoises, divided into as 
many as 20 genera. These, starting with Emys as the least special- 
ized, can be arranged in two main diverging lines, one culminating 
in the thoroughly aquatic _ Batagur, the other in the exclusively 
terrestrial forms. Emys, with the plastron movably united to the 
carapace; with well-webbed limbs, amphibious. E. orbicularis or 
europaea was, towards the end of the Pleistocene period, distributed 
over a great part of middle Europe, remains occurring in the peat 
of England, Belgium, Denmark and Sweden; it is now withdrawing 
eastwards, being restricted in Germany to isolated localities east 
of Berlin, but it reoccurs in Poland and Russia, whence it extends 
into western Asia ; it is common in south Europe. The other species, 
E. blandingi, lives in Canada and the north-eastern states of the 
Union. Clemmys with the plastron immovably united to the cara- 
pace; temperate holarctic. region, e.g. C. caspica, C.leprosa in 
Spain and Morocco; C. insculpta, in north-east America. Mala- 
cocltmmys with a few species in North America, e.g. M. terrapin, 
the much prized *' diamond-back." Chrysemys with many American 
species, e.g. Ch. picta, the " painted terrapin " and C. concinna, 
most of them very handsomely coloured and marked when still 
young. Batagur and Kachuga in the Indian sub-region.^ 

Cistudo Carolina, the box tortoise of North America, with the 
plastron divided into an anterior and a posterior movable lobe, so 
that the creature can shut itself up completely.^ Although essen- 
tially by its internal structure a water tortoise, it has become 
absolutely terrestrial in habits, and herewith agree the high- 
backed instead of depressed shell, the short webless fingers and its 
general coloration. It has a mixed diet. The eyes of the males 
are red, those of the females are brown. From Long Island to 
Mexico. Cinixys, e.g. belliana of tropical Africa, has the posterior 
portion of the carapace movably hinged. Pyxis arachnoides of 
Madagascar has the front-lobe of the plastron hinged. 

Testudo, the main genus, with about 40 species, is cosmopolitan 
in tropical and sub-tropical countries, with the exception of the whole 
of the Australian and Malay countries; most of the species are 
African. T. graeca, in Mediterranean countries and islands. T. 
marginata in Greece with the posterior margin of the carapace 
much flanged or serrated, and T. ibera or maurttanica from Morocco 
to Persia; both differ from T. graeca by an unpaired supracaudal, 
mcrginal shield, and by the possession of a strong, conical, horny 
tubercle on the hinder surface of the thigh. With age the posterior 
portion of the plastron develops a transverse ligamentous hinge. 
T. polyphemus, the " gopher " of southern United States, lives in 
pairs in self-dug burrows. T. tabulata is one of the few South 
American terrestrial tortoises. 

Of great interest are the so-called gigantic land tortoises. In 
former epochs truly gigantic species of the genus Testudo had a wide 
and probably more continuous distribution. There was T. atlas, 
of the Pliocene of the Sivalik hills with a skull nearly 8 in. long, 
but the shell probably measured not more than 6 ft. in length, 
the restored specimen in the Natural History Museum at South 
Kensington being exaggerated. T. perpigniana of Pliocene France 
was also large. Large land tortoises, with a length of shell of 
more than 2 ft., became restricted to two widely separated regions 
of the world, viz. the Galapagos Islands (called thus after the Spanish 
galapago, i.e. tortoise), and islands in the western Indian Ocean 
viz. the Mascarenes (Bourbon, Mauritius and Rodriguez) and Aldabra. 
When they became extinct in Madagascar is not known, but 
T. grandidieri was a very large kind, of apparently very recent date. 
At the time of their discovery those smaller islands were un- 
inhabited by man or any predaceous mammal. It was on these 
peaceful islands that land tortoises lived in great numbers; with 



plenty of food there was nothing for them to do but to feed, to 
propagate, to grow and to vary. Most of the islands were or are 
inhabited by one _ or more typical, local forms. As they provided, 
like the equally ill-fated dodo and solitaire, a welcome provision 
of excellent meat, ships carried them about, to be slaughtered as 
occasion required, and soon almost exterminated them; some 
were occasionally liberated on other islands, for instance, on the 
Seychelles and on the Chagos, or they were left as presents, in 
Ceylon, Java or on Rotuma near the Fijis. Thus it has come to 
pass that the few survivors have been very much scattered. The 
small genuine stock at Aldabra is now under government protection, 
in a way. A large male of T. gigantea or elephantina or tyololissa 
or ponderosa, was brought to London and weighed 870 lb; another 
specimen had in 1908 been living at St Helena for more than one 
hundred years. A specimen of T. daudini, native of the South 
Island of Aldabra, was known for many years on Egmont Island, 
one of the Chagos group, then it was taken to Mauritius and then 
to England, where of course it soon died; its shell measures 55 in. 
in a straight line, and it weighed 560 lb. The type specimen of 
T. sumeirei, supposed to have come originally from the Seychelles, 
was in 1908 still kept in the barrack grounds at Port Louis, Mauri- 
tius, and had been known as a large tortoise for about 150 years. 
T. vosmaeri was a very thin-shelled species in Rodriguez. Of the 
Galapagos species T. ephippium still survives on Duncan Island; 
T. abingdoni lived on Abingdon Island; of T. elephantopus or 
vicina, G. Baur still collected 21 specimens in 1893 on Albemarle 
Island. One monster of this kind is said to have measured 56 in. 
over the curve of the carapace, with a skull a little more than 7 in. 
in length. All the Galapagos species are remarkable for their 
comparatively small head and the very long neck, which is much 
larger and more slender than that of the eastern species. 

Family 6. Chelonidae. Marine turtles, with only two recent 
genera, with three widely distributed species. The limbs are paddle- 
shapea, with only one or two claws, and the shell is covered with 
horny shields. The neck is short and incompletely retractile. 
The parietals, post-frontals, squamosals, quadrato-jugals, and jugals 
are much expanded and form an additional or false roof over the 
temporal region of the skull. 

The Chelonidae are a highly specialized offshoot of the Cryptodira, 
adapted to marine life. Fundamentally they agree most with the 
Testudinidae, and there is nothing primitive about them except 
that they still possess complete series of inframar^inal shields. 

Ckelone, with only 4 pairs of costal shields, with 5 neurals and 
a broad nuchal. C, tnydas s. viridis, the " green or edible turtle,"

has, when adult, a nearly smooth shell. It attains a length of 
nearly 4 ft., and may then weigh more than three hundredweight. 
Their food consists of algae, and of Zostera marina. Their capture 
forms a regular pursuit wherever they occur in any numbers. 
Comparatively few are caught in the open sea, others in staked 
nets, but the majority are intercepted at well-known periods and 
localities where they go ashore to deposit their eggs. These are 
round, with a parchment-like shell and buried in the sand, above 
the high-tide mark, as many as 100 to 250 being laid by one female. 
They are eagerly searched for and eaten. The famous turtle- 
soup is made not only of the meat and the fat, but also from the 
thick and gelatinous layer of subcutaneous tissue which lines the 
inside of the shell. Only the females are eaten; the males, recogniz- 
able by the longer tail, are rejected at the_ London market. This 
species inhabits the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans. 

C. imbricata, the " hawksbill turtle. " The shields are thick, 
strongly overlapping each other from before backwards, but in 
old specimens the shields lose their keel, flatten and become juxta- 
posed. The horny cover of the upper jaw forms a hooked beak. 
This species lives upon fish and molluscs^ and is not eaten; but 
is much persecuted for the horny shields which yield the

41 tortoise-shell, " so far as this is not a fraudulent imitation. When 
heated in oil, or boiled, the shields (which singly are not thick enough 
to be manufactured into larger articles) can be welded together 
under pressure and be given any desired shape. The " hawksbill "

ranges over all the tropical and sub-tropical seas and scarcely reaches 
3 ft. in length, but such a shell yields up to 8 lb of tortoiscshell. 

Thalassochelys caretta, the " loggerhead, " has normally five pairs 
of costal shields, but whilst the number of shields in the genus 
Chelone is very constant, that of the loggerhead varies individually 
to an astonishing extent. The greatest number of neurals ob- 
served, and counting the nuchal as the first, is 8, and 8 pairs of 
costal, in all 24; the lowest numbers are 6 neurals with 5 pairs of 
costals; odd costals are frequent. The most interesting facts are 
that some of the supernumerary shields are much smaller than the 
others, sometimes mere vestiges in all stages of gradual suppression, 
and that the abnormalities are much more common in babies and 
small specimens than in adults. The importance of these ortho- 
genetic variations has been discussed by H. Gadow in A. Willey's 
Zoolog. Results, pt. iii. p. 207-222, pis. 24, 25 (Cambridge 1899). 




Fig. 7. — Loggerhead (Thalassochelys caretta). 



The " loggerhead " is carnivorous, feeding on fish, molluscs and 
crustaceans, and is not esteemed as food. A great part of the 
turtle-oil^ which finds its way into the market is obtained from it; 
its tortoiseshell is of an inferior quality. Besides all the inter- 
tropical seas it inhabits the Mediterranean, and is an accidental 
visitor of the western coasts of Europe. The old specimen captured 
on the Dutch coast in 1894 contained the enormous number of 
1150 eggs.

the millions of eggs which are, or were, annually collected for the 
sake of their oil. Bates (The Naturalist on the River Amazon) 
gives a most interesting account of these turtles, which are entirely 
frugivorous. 

Family 2. Chelydidae. — The neck, when bent, remains partly 
exposed. Shell covered with shields. Plastron composed of 9 

Clates, but covered withi3 shields. This family, still represented 
y nearly 30 species, with 8 genera, is found in South America 
and in Australia. Chelys jfitnbriata, the " matamata " in the rivers of 
Guiana and North Brazil; total length about 3 ft.; with animal 
diet. Hydrotnedusa, e.g. tectifera, with very long neck, in Brazil, 
much resembling Chelodina, e.g. longicollis of the Australian region. 
Family 3. Carettochelydidae. — Carettochelys inscutpta, the only 
species, in the Fly river of New Guinea; still imperfectly known. 
This peculiar turtle seems to stand in the same relation to the Chely- 
didae and to the Trionychidae as do the Chelonidae to the Testu- 
dinidae by the transformation of the limbs into paddles with only two 
claws, and the complete reduction of the horny shields upon the 
shell, which is covered with soft skin. The plastron is composed 
of 9 plates; the 6 neural plates are all separated from one another 
by the costals. The premaxilla is single, as elsewhere only in

Chelys and in the Trionychidae. The neck is short and non-retractile. 
Length of shell about 18 in. 

Super-family 3. Trionychoidea. — The shell is very flat and much 
smaller than the body, and covered with soft leathery skin, but 
traces of horny structures are still represented, especially in the 
young of some species, by numerous scattered little spikes on the 
back of the shell and even on the soft parts of the back. The limbs 
arc short, broadly webbed and only the three inner digits are pro- 
vided with claws. Head and neck are retractile, bending in a sig- 
moid curve in a vertical plane. The jaws are concealed by soft 
lip-like flaps and the nose forms a short soft proboscis. The tem- 
poral region is not covered in by any arches; the quadrate is trumpet- 
shaped as in the Chelydidae, but the jugular arch is complete. 
The pelvis is not anchylosed to the shell. The carapace is much 
reduced in size, the ribs extending beyond the costal plates, and 
there are no marginals; except in the African Cyclanorbis the 
neural plates form a continuous series. All the nine elements of 
the plastron are deficient and but very loosely connected with each 
other. Most of these reductions in the skeletal and tegumentary 
armature are the result of life in muddy waters, in the bottom of 
which these creatures bury themselves with only the head exposed. 
They feed upon aquatic animals; those which are partial to hard- 
shclled molluscs soon wear down the sharp horny edges of the jaws, 
and thick horny crushing pads are developed in their stead. They 



only crawl upon land in order to lay their round brittle eggs. 
Trionyxes inhabit the rivers of Asia, Africa and North America. 
Trionyx jer ox, the " soft-shelled turtle," in the whole of the Missis- 
sippi basin and in the chain of the great northern lakes. T. triunguis 
in Africa, the largest species, with a length of shell of 3 ft. T. 
kurum and T. gangeticus are the commonest Indian species. The 
young are ornamented with two or three pairs of large, round, 
ocellated spots on the back. (H. F. G.) 

TORTOISESHELL. The tortoiseshell of commerce consists 
of the epidermic plates covering the bony carapace of the 
hawksbill turtle, Chelonia itnbricata, the smallest of the sea 
turtles. The plates of the back or carapace, technically called 
the head, are 13 in number, 5 occupying the centre, flanked 
by 4 on each side. These overlap each other to the extent of 
one-third of their whole size, and hence they attain a large size, 
reaching in the largest to 8 in. by 13 in., and weighing as 
much as 9 oz. The carapace has also 24 marginal pieces, 
called hoofs or claws, forming a serrated edge round it; but these, 
with the plates of the plastron, or belly, are of inferior value. The 
plates of tortoiseshell consist of horny matter, but they are 
harder, more brittle, and less fibrous than ordinary horn. 
Their value depends on the rich mottled colours they display — a 
warm translucent yellow, dashed and spotted with rich brown 
tints — and on the high polish they take and retain. The finest 
tortoiseshell is obtained from the Eastern Archipelago, par- 
ticularly from the east coast of Celebes to New Guinea; but the 
creature is found and tortoiseshell obtained from all tropical 
coasts, large supplies coming from the West Indian Islands and 
Brazil. 

Tortoiseshell is worked precisely as horn; but, owing to the high 
value of the material, care is taken to prevent any waste in its 
working. The plates, asseparated by heat from the bony skeleton, 
are keeled, curved, and irregular in form. They are first flattened 
by heat and pressure, and superficial inequalities are rasped away. 
Being harder and more brittle than horn, tortoiseshell requires 
careful treatment in moulding it into any form, and as high heat 
tends to darken and obscure the material it is treated at as low a 
heat as practicable. For many purposes it is necessary to increase 
the thickness or to add to the superficial size of tortoiseshell, and 
this is readily done by careful cleaning and rasping of the surfaces 
to be united, softening the plates in boiling water or sometimes by 
dry heat, and then pressing them tightly together by means of heated 
pincers or a vice. The heat softens and liquefies a superficial film 
of the horny material, and that with the pressure effects a perfect 
union of the surfaces brought together. Heat and pressure are 
also employed to mould the substance into boxes and the numerous 
artificial^ forms into which it is made up. 

Tortoiseshell has been a prized ornamental material from very 
early times. It was oneof the highly esteemed treasures of the 
Far East brought to ancient Rome by way of Egypt, and it was 
eagerly sought by wealthy Romans as a veneer for their rich furniture. 
In mpdern times it is most characteristically used in the elaborate 
inlaying of t cabinet-work known as buhl furniture, and in com- 
bination with silver for toilet articles. It isalso employed as a 
veneer for small boxes and frames. It is cut into combs, moulded 
into snuff-boxes and other small boxes, formed into knife-handles, 
and worked up into many other similar minor articles. The plates 
from certain other tortoises, known commercially as turtle-shell, 
possess a certain industrial value, but they are either opaque or 
soft and leathery, and cannot be mistaken for tortoiseshell. A 
close imitation of tortoiseshell can be made by staining translucent 
horn or by varieties of celluloid. 

TORTOLi, a town and episcopal see of Sardinia, on the east 
coast, 140 m. N.N.E. of Cagliari by rail (55 m. direct). Pop. 
(1901), 2105. It lies 60 ft. above sea-level to the south-west of a 
large lagoon, which renders it unhealthy. The harbour is 2§ m. to 
the east, and serves for the export of the wine and agricultural 
produce of the Ogliastra. A little to the south of Tortoli was 
the station of Sulci on the Roman coast road, known to us only 
from the itineraries. 

TORTONA (anc. Derlona), a town and episcopal see of Pied- 
mont, Italy, in the province of Alessandria, from which it is 
14 m. E. by rail, on the right bank of the Scrivia, at the northern 
foot of the Apennines, 394 ft. above sea-level. Pop. (1901), 
11,308 (town); 17,419 (commune). Tortona is on the main line 
from Milan to Genoa; from it a main line runs to Alessandria, 
a branch to Castelnuovo Scrivia, and a steam tramway to 
Sale. Its fortifications were destroyed by the French after 
Marengo (1799); the ramparts are now turned into shady

promenades. The cathedral, erected by Philip II., contains a 
remarkably fine Roman sarcophagus of the Christian period. 
Silk-weaving, tanning and hat-making are the chief industries; 
and there is some trade in wine and grain. 

Dertona, which may have become a Roman colony as early 
as the 2nd century B.C. and certainly did so under Augustus, 
is spoken of by Strabo as one of the most important towns of 
Liguria. It stood at the point of divergence of the Via 
Postumia (see Liguria) and the Via Aemilia, while a branch 
road ran hence to Pollentia. A number of ancient inscriptions 
and other objects have been found here. In the middle ages 
Tortona was zealously attached to the Guelphs, on which 
account it was twice laid waste by Frederick Barbarossa, in 
1155 and 1163. (T. As.) 

TORTOSA, a fortified city of north-east Spain, in the province 
of Tarragona; 40 m. by rail W.S.W. of the city of Tarragona, 
on the river Ebro 22 m. above its mouth. Pop. (1900), 24,452. 
Tortosa is for the most part an old walled town on the left bank 
of the river, with narrow, crooked and ill-paved streets, in which 
the houses are lofty and massively built of granite. But some 
parts of the old town have been rebuilt, and there is a modern 
suburb on the opposite side of the Ebro. The slope on which 
old Tortosa stands is crowned with an ancient castle, which 
has been restored and converted into barracks and a hospital. 
All the fortifications are obsolete. The cathedral occupies the 
site of a Moorish mosque built in 914. The present structure, 
which dates from 1347, has its Gothic character disguised 
by a classical facade with Ionic pillars and much tasteless 
modernization. The stalls in the choir, carved by Cristobal de 
Salamanca in 1588-1593, and the sculpture of the pulpits, as well 
as the iron-work of the choir-railing and some of the precious 
marbles with which the chapels are adorned, deserve notice. 
The other public buildings include an episcopal palace, a town- 
hall and numerous churches. There are manufactures of 
paper, hats, leather, ropes, porcelain, majolica, soap, spirits, 
and ornaments made of palm leaves and grasses. There is an 
important fishery in the river, and the harbour is accessible to 
vessels of 100 tons burden. Corn, wine, oil, wool, silk, fruits 
and . liquorice (a speciality of the district) are exported. The 
city is connected with Barcelona and Valencia by the coast 
railway, and with Saragossa by the Ebro valley line; it is also 
the terminus of a railway to San Carlos de la Rapita on the 
Mediterranean. Near Tortosa are rich quarries of marble and 
alabaster. 

Tortosa, the Dertosa of Strabo and the Colonia Julia Augusta 
Dertosa of numerous coins, was a city of the Ilercaones in 
Hispania Tarraconensis. Under the Moors it was of great im- 
portance as the key of the Ebro valley. It was taken by Louis 
the Pious in 811 (after an unsuccessful siege two years before), 
but was soon recaptured. Having become a haunt of pirates, 
and exceedingly injurious to Italian commerce, it was made the 
object of a crusade proclaimed by Pope Eugenius III. in 1148, 
and was captured by Ramon Berenguer IV., count of Barcelona, 
assisted by Templars, Pisans and Genoese. An attempt to 
recapture the city in 1149 was defeated by the heroism of the 
women, who were thenceforth empowered by the count to wear 
the red sash of the Order of La Hacha (The Axe), to import 
their clothes free of duty, and to precede their bridegrooms at 
weddings. Tortosa fell into the hands of the duke of Orleans 
in 1708; during the Peninsular War it surrendered in 1811 to 
the French under Suchet, who held it till 1814. 

TORTURE (from Lat. torquere, to twist), the general name for 
innumerable modes of inflicting pain which have been from time 
to time devised by the perverted ingenuity of man, and especially 
for those employed in a legal aspect by the civilized nations of 
antiquity and of modern Europe. From this point of view 
torture was always inflicted for one of two purposes: (1) As a 
means of eliciting evidence from a witness or from an accused 
person either before or after condemnation; (2) as a part of the 
punishment. The second was the earlier use, its function as a 
means of evidence arising when rules were gradually formulated 
by the experience of legal experts. 



Torture as a part of the punishment may be regarded as 
including every kind of bodily or mental pain beyond what is 
necessary for the safe custody of the offender (with or without 
enforced labour) or the destruction of his life — in the language 
of Bentham, an " afflictive " as opposed to a " simple " punish- 
ment. Thus the unnecessary' sufferings endured in English 
prisons before the reforms of John Howard, the peine forte 
et dure, and the drawing and quartering in executions for 
treason, fall without any straining of terms under the category 
of torture. 

The whole subject is now one of only historical interest as far 
as Europe is concerned. It was, however, up to a comparatively 
recent date an integral part of the law of most countries 
(to which England, Aragon and Sweden 1 formed honourable 
exceptions) — as much a commonplace of law as trial by jury 
in England. 2 The prevailing view, no doubt, was that truth was 
best obtained by confession, the regina probationum. Where 
confession was not voluntary, it must be extorted. Speaking 
generally, torture may be said to have succeeded the ordeal 
and trial by battle. Where these are found in full vigour, 
as in the capitularies of Charlemagne, there is no provision for 
torture. It was no doubt accepted reluctantly as being a 
quasi judicium Dei, but tolerated in the absence of any better 
means of eliciting truth, especially in cases of great gravity, on 
the illogical assumption that extraordinary offences must be 
met by extraordinary remedies. Popular feeling too, says 
Verri, preferred, as causes of evil, human beings who could be 
forced to confess, rather than natural causes which must be 
accepted with resignation. Confession, as probatio probatissima 
and vox vera, was the best of all evidence, and all the machinery 
of law was moved to obtain it. The trials for witchcraft 
remain on record as a refutation of the theory. 

The opinions of the best lay authorities have been almost 
unanimously against the use of torture, even in a system where 
it was as completely established as it was in Roman law. " Tor- 
menta," says Cicero, 3 in words which it is almost impossible to 
translate satisfactorily, " gubernat dolor, regit quaesitor, flectit 
libido, corrumpit spes, infirmat metus, ut in tot rerum angustiis 
nihil veritati loci relinquatur." Seneca says bitterly, " it forces 
even the innocent to he." St Augustine 4 recognizes the fallacy 
of torture. " If," says he, " the accused be innocent, he will 
undergo for an uncertain crime a certain punishment, and that 
not for having committed a crime, but because it is unknown 
whether he committed it." At the same time he regards it as 
excused by its necessity. The words of Ulpian, in the Digest 
of Justinian, 5 are no less impressive: "The torture (quaestio) 
is not to be regarded as wholly deserving or wholly undeserving 
of confidence; indeed, it is untrustworthy, perilous and decep- 
tive. For most men, by patience or the severity of the torture, 
come so to despise the torture that the truth cannot be elicited 
from them; others are so .impatient that they will lie in any 
direction rather than suffer the torture; so it happens that they 
depose to contradictions and accuse not only themselves but 
others." Montaigne's 6 view of torture as a part of the punish- 
ment is a most just one: " All that exceeds a simple death 
appears to me absolute cruelty; neither can our justice expect 
that he whom the fear of being executed by being beheaded or 
hanged will not restrain should be any more awed by the imagina- 
tion of a languishing fire, burning pincers, or the wheel." 
He continues with the curious phrase: "He whom the judge 
has tortured (gehenne) that he may not die innocent, dies inno- 
cent and tortured." Montesquieu 7 speaks of torture in a most 
guarded manner, condemning it, but without giving reasons, 
and eulogizing England for doing without it. The system was 
condemned by Bayle and Voltaire with less reserve. Among 

1 But even in these countries, whatever the law was, torture 
certainly existed in fact. 

2 Primitive systems varied. There is no trace of it in Babylonian 
or Mosaic law, but Egyptian and Assyrian provided for it; and the 
story of Regulus seems to show that it was in use at Carthage.

the Germans, Sonnenfels (1766), and, among the Italians, 
Beccaria, 1 Verri 2 and Manzoni 3 will be found to contain most that 
can be said on the subject. The influence of Beccaria in rendering 
the use of torture obsolete was undoubtedly greater than that of 
any other legal reformer. The great point that he makes is 
the unfair incidence of torture, as minds and bodies differ in 
strength. Moreover, it is, says he, to confound all relations to 
expect that a man should be both accuser and accused, and that 
pain should be the test of truth, as though truth resided in the 
muscles and fibres of a wretch under torture. The result of the 
torture is simply a matter of calculation. Given the force of the 
muscles and the sensibility of the nerves of an innocent person, 
it is required to find the degree of pain necessary to make bim 
confess himself guilty of a given crime. Bentham's 4 objection 
to torture is that the effect is exactly the reverse of the intention. 
" Upon the face of it, and probably enough in the intention of 
the framers, the object of this institution was the protection 
of innocence; the protection of guilt and the aggravation of the 
pressure upon innocence was the real fruit of it." The apologists 
of torture are chiefly among jurists. But theoretical objections 
to it are often urged by the authors of books of practice, as by 
Damhouder, von Rosbach, von Bodcn, Voet, and others named 
below under the head of The Netherlands. It is worthy 
of note as illustrative of the feeling of the time that even Bacon 6 
compares experiment in nature to torture in civil matters as the 
best means of eliciting truth. Muyart de Vouglans 6 derives 
the origin of torture from the law of God. Other apologists 
are Simancas, bishop of Badajoz, 7 Engel, 8 Pedro de Castro, 9 
and in England Sir R. Wiseman. 10 

Greece. — The opinion of Aristotle was in favour of torture as a 
mode of proof. ' It is/* he says, " a kind of evidence, and appears 
to carry with it absolute credibility because a kind of constraint 
is applied." It is classed as one of the " artless persuasions " 
(firex^ot TrlffTtts). 11 " It was the surest means of obtaining evidence, 
says Demosthenes. 12 At Athens slaves, and probably at times 
resident aliens, were tortured, 13 in the former case generally with 
the master's consent, but torture was seldom applied to free citizens, 1 * 
such application being forbidden by a psephism passed in the 
archonship of Scamandrius. After the mutilation of the Hermae 
in 415 B.C. a proposition was made* but not carried, that it should 
be applied to two senators named by an informer. In this particular 
case Andocides gave up all his slaves to be tortured. 16 Torture was 
sometimes inflicted in open court. The rack was used as a punish- 
ment even for free citizens. Antiphon was put to death by this 
means. 1 * The torture of Nicias by the Syracusans is alluded to by 
Thucydides 17 as an event likely to happen, and it was only in order 
to avoid the possibility of inconvenient disclosures that he was put 
to death without torture, lsocrates and Lysias refer to torture 
under the generic name of aTpkftXoxrts, but it was generally called 
/3d(racot, in the plural, like tormenta. As might be expected, 
torture was frequently inflicted by the Greek despots, and both 
Zeno and Anaxarchus are said to have been put to it by such irre- 
sponsible authorities. At Sparta the despot Nabis was accustomed, 
as we learn from Polybius, 19 to put persons to death by an instrument 
of torture in the form of his wife Apega, a mode of torture no doubt 
resembling the Jungfernkuss once used in Germany. At Argos, as 
Diodorus informs us (xv. 57), certain conspirators were put to the 
torture in 371 B.C. 19

Rome. — The Roman system was the basis of all subsequent 
European systems which recognized torture as a part of their pro- 
cedure, and the rules attained a refinement Deyond anything 
approached at Athens. The law of torture was said by Cicero to rest 
originally on custom {mores majorum), but there is no allusion to it 
in the Twelve Tables. There are frequent allusions to it in the 
classical writers, 20 both of the republic andthe empire. The law, 
as it existed under the later empire, is contained mainly in the titles 
De quaestionibus 21 of the Digest and the Code n — the former consisting 
largely of opinions from the Sententiae receptae of Paulus, 23 the latter 
being for the most part merely a repetition of constitutions contained 
in the Theodosian Code. 2 * Both substantive law and procedure 
were dealt with by these texts of Roman law, the latter, however, 
not as fully as in medieval codes, a large discretion being left to the 
judges. Torture was used both in civil and criminal trials, but in 
the former only upon slaves and freedmen or infamous persons (after 
Nov. xc. 1, 1, upon ignoti and obscuri if they showed signs of corrup- 
tions—such as gladiators — and in the absence of alia manifesta 
indicia?* as in cases affecting the inheritance (res hereditariae). Its 
place in the case of free citizens was taken by the reference to the 
oath of the party. During the republic torture appears to have 
been confined to slaves in all cases, but with the empire a free man 
became liable to it if accused of a crime, though in most cases not as 
a witness. On an accusation of treason every one, whatever his 
rank, was liable to torture, for in treason the condition of all was 
equal. 24 The same was the case of those accused of sorcery (magi), 
who were regarded as humani generis inimiciP A wife might be 
tortured (but only after her slaves had been put to the torture) it 
accused of poisoning her husband. In accusations of crimes other 
than treason or sorcery, certain persons were protected by the dignity 
of their position or their tender age. The main exemptions were 
contained in a constitution of Diocletian and Maximian, and included 
soldiers, nobles of a particular rank, i.e. eminentissimi and perfectis- 
simi, and their descendants to the third generation, and decuriones 
and their children to a limited extent (tormenta moderata) — that is 
to say, they were subject to the torture of the plumbatae in certain 
cases, such as fraud on the revenue and extortion. In addition to 
these, priests (but not clergy of a lower rank), children under fourteen 
and pregnant women were exempt. A free man could be tortured 
only where he had been inconsistent in his depositions, or where 
there was a suspicion that he was lying. 28 The rules as to the torture 
of slaves were numerous and precise. It was a maxim of Roman 
law that torture of slaves was the most efficacious means of obtaining 
truth. 2 ^ They could be tortured either as accused or as witnesses 
for their masters in all cases, but against their masters only in 
accusations of treason, adultery, frauds on the revenue, coining, and 
similar offences (which were regarded as a species of treason), 
attempts by a husband or wife on the life of the other, and in cases 
where a master had bought a slave for the special reason that he 
should not give evidence against him. The privilege from accusa- 
tions by the slave extended to the master's father, mother, wife, or 
tutor, and also to a former masten On the same principle a freedman 
could not be tortured against his patron. The privilege did not 
apply where the slave was joint property, and one of his masters had 
been murdered by the other, or where he was the property of a 
corporation, for in such a case he could be tortured in a charge against 
a member of the corporation. Slaves belonging to the inheritance 
could be tortured in actions concerning the inheritance. The adult 
slaves of a deceased person could be tortured where the deceased had 
been murdered. In a charge of adultery against a wife, her husband's, 
her own and her father's slaves could be put to the torture. A 
slave manumitted for the express purpose of escaping torture was 
regarded as still liable to it. Before putting a slave^ to torture 
without the consent of his master, security must be given to the 
master for his value and the oath of calumny must be taken. 30 The 
master of a slave tortured on a false accusation could recover double 
his value from the accuser. The undergoing of torture had at one 
time a serious effect upon the after-life ofthe slave, for in the time of 
Gaius a slave who had been tortured could on manumission obtain 
no higher civil rights than those of a dediticius. 31 The rules of 
procedure were conceived in a spirit of as much fairness as such rules 
could be. Some of the most important were these: The amount 
of torture was at the discretion of the judge, but it was to be so 



20 An instance is Pliny's letter to Trajan (Epist. x. 97), where he 
mentions having put to the torture two Christian? deaconesses 
(ministrae). The words are confitentes iterum ac tertio interrogavi. 
This supports Tertullian's objection to the torture of Christians, 
torquemur confitentes (ApoL c. 2). 

21 Quaestio includedthe whole process of which torture was a part. 
In the words of Cujacius, Quaestio est interrogate quae fit per lormenta, 
vet de reis, vel de testibus qui facto intervenisse dicuntur.

applied as not to injure life or limb. If so applied the judge was 
injamis. The examination was not to begin by torture; other 
proofs must be exhausted first. The evidence 1 must have advanced 
so far that nothing but the confession of the slave was wanting to 
complete it. Those of weakest frame and tenderest age were to be 
tortured first. Except in treason , the unsupported testimony of a 
single witness was not a sufficient ground for torture. The voice 
and manner of the accused were to be carefully observed. A spon- 
taneous confession, or the evidence of a personal enemy, was to be 
received with caution. Repetition of the torture could only be 
ordered in case of inconsistent depositions or denial in the face of 
strong evidence. There was no rule limiting the number of repeti- 
tions. Leading questions were not to be asked. A judge was not 
liable to an action for anything done during the course of the examina- 
tion. An appeal from an order to torture was competent to the 
accused, except in the case of slaves, when an appeal could be made 
only by the master. 2 The appellant was not to be tortured pending 
the appeal, but was to remain in prison.' The quaesitor asked the 
questions, the tortores applied the instruments. The principal 
forms of torture in use were the equuleus, or rack (mentioned as far 
back as Cicero), 4 the plumbatae, or leaden balls, the ungulae, or 
barbed hooks, the lamina, or hot plate, the mala mansion and the* 
fidiculae, or cord compressing the arm. Other allusions in the 
Digest and Code, in addition to those already cited, may be shortly 
noticed. The testimony of a gladiator or infamous person (such as 
an accomplice) was not valid without torture. 6 This was no doubt 
the origin of the medieval maxims (which were, however, by no 
means universally recognized) — Vilitas personae est justa causa 
torquendi testem, and Tortura purgalur infamia. Torture could not 
be inflicted during the forty days of Lent. 7 ^ Robbers and pirates 
might be tortured even on Easter day, the divine pardon being hoped 
for where the safety of societywas thus assured. 8 Capital punish- 
ment was not to be suffered until after conviction or confession under 
torture. 9 Withdrawal from prosecution (abolitio) was not to be 
allowed as a rule after the accused had undergone the torture. 10 In 
charges of treason the accuser was liable to torture if he did not 
prove his case. 11 The infliction of torture, not judicial, but at the 
same time countenanced by law, was at one time allowed to creditors. 
They were allowed to keep their debtors in private prisons, and most 
cruelly ill-use them, in order to extort payment. 12 Under the empire 

Crivate prisons were forbidden. 1 * In the time of Juvenal the Roman 
idies actually hired the public torturers to torture their domestic 
slaves. 14 As a part of the punishment torture was in frequent use. 
Crucifixion, mutilation, exposure to wild beasts in the arena and 
other cruel modes of destroying life were common, especially in the 
time of the persecution of the Christians underNero. 16 Crucifixion 
as a punishment was abolished by Constantine in 315, in veneration 
of the memory of Him who was crucified for mankind. On the other 
hand, where the interests of the Church were concerned the tendency 
was in favour of greater severity^ Thus, by the Theodosian Code, 
a heretic was to be flogged with lead (contusus plumbo) before 
banishment, 18 and Justinian made liable to torture and exile any one 
insulting a bishop or priest in a church, or saying litany, if a layman. 17 

1 The evidence on which the accused might be tortured was 
expressed in Roman law by the terms argumentum and indicium 
(used technically as early as Cicero, Verres, i. 10 and 17). The 
latter term, as will be seen, afterwards became one of the most 
important in the law of torture, but the analysis of indicium is later 
than Roman law. Indicium was not quite the same thing as semi- 
plena probatio, though the terms appear to be occasionally used as 
synonyms. Indicium was rather the foundation or cause of 
probatio, whether plena or semiplena. An indicium or a concurrence 
of indicia might, according to circumstances, constitute a plena or 
semiplena probatio. The phrase legitima indicia was sometimes used. 
In Sir T. Smith's work, c. 24 (see below), index means a prisoner 
acting as an approver under torture. Tormentum, tortura and 
quaestio appear to be equivalent terms. The medieval jurists 
derived the first of these from torquere mentem, an etymology as false 
as testamentum from Ustatio mentis (Inst. ii. 10 pr.).

The Leges barbarorum are interesting as forming the link of connexion 
between the Roman and the medieval systems. Through them the 
Roman doctrines were transmitted into the Roman law countries. 
The barbarian codes were based chiefly on the Theodosian Code. 
As compared with Roman law there seems to be a leaning towards 
humanity, e.g. the provision for redemption of a slave after confession 
by s. 40 of the Lex salica. After the edict of Gundobald in 501 
the combat rather than the torture became the expression of the 
judicium Dei. 

The Church. — As far as it could the Church adopted the Roman 
law. The Church generally secured the almost entire immunity of 
its clergy, at any rate of the higher ranks, from torture by civil 
tribunals; 18 but in general, where laymen were concerned all persons 
were equal. In many instances councils of the Church pronounced 
against torture, e.g. in a synod at Rome in 384. 19 Torture even of 
heretics seems to have been originally left to the ordinary tribunals. 
Thus a bull of Innocent IV., in 1282, directed the torture of heretics by 
the civil power, as being robbers and murderers of souls, and thieves 
of the sacraments of God. 20 The Church also enjoined torture for 
usury. 21 A characteristic division of torture, accepted by the Church, 
but not generally acknowledged by lay authorities, was into spiritual 
and corporal, the latter being simply the^ imposition of the oath of 
purgation, the only form originally in use in the ecclesiastical courtsr 
The canon law contains little on the subject of torture, and that little 
of a comparatively humane nature. It laid down that it was no sin in 
the faithful to inflict torture, 22 but a priest might not do so with his 
own hands, 23 and charity was to be used in all punishments. 24 No 
confession was to be extracted by torture 26 and it was not to be 
ordered indiciis non praecedentibus.™ The principal ecclesiastical 
tribunal by which torture was inflicted in more recent times was the 
Inquisition. The code of instructions issued by Torquemada in 
Spain in^ 1484 provided that an accused person might be put to the 
torture if semiplena probatio existed against the accused— that is, 
so much evidence as to raise a grave and not merely a light presump- 
tion of guilt, often used for the evidence of one eye or ear witness of 
a fact. If the accused confessed during torture, and afterwards 
confirmed the confession, he was punished as convicted; if he 
retracted, he was tortured again, or subjected to extraordinary 
punishment. One or two inquisitors, or a commissioner of the Holy 
Office, were bound to be present at every examination. Owing to the 
occurrence of certain cases of abuse of torture, a decree of Philip II. 
was issued, in 1558, forbidding the administration of torture 
without an order from the council. But this decree does not appear 
to have been fully observed. By the edict of the inquisitor-general 
Vald6s, in 1561, torture was to be left to the prudence and equity of 
the judges. They must consider motives and circumstances before 
decreeing torture, and must declare whether it is to be employed in 
caput propriunt, i.e. to extort a confession, or in caput alienum, i.e. 
to incriminate an accomplice. Torture was not to be decreed until 
the termination of the process and after defence heard, and the 
decree was subject to appeal, but only in doubtful cases, to the Council 
of the Supreme. It was also only in doubtful cases that the inquisitors 
were bound to consult the council; where the law was clear (and 
of this they were the judges) there need be no consultation, and no 
appeal was allowed. On ratification twenty-four hours afterwards 
of a confession made under torture, the accused might be reconciled, 
if the inquisitors believed him to be sincerely repentant. If 
convicted of bad faith he might be relaxed, i.e. delivered to the 
secular power to Jbe burned. The inquisitors had a discretion to 
allow the accused to make the canonical purgation by oath 
instead of undergoing corporal torture, but the rule which allows 
this to be done at the same time discountenances it as fallacious. 
It is remarkable that the rules do not allow much greater efficacy 
to torture. They speak of it almost in the terms of Roman law 
as dangerous and uncertain, and depending for its effects on 
physical strength. 27 Torture had ceased to be inflicted before the 
suppression 01 the Inquisition, and in 1816 a papal bull decreed 
that torture should cease, that proceedings^ should be public, and 
that the accuser should be confronted with the accused. The 
rules in themselves were not so^ cruel as the construction put upon 
them by the inquisitors. For instance, by^Torquemada's instruc- 
tions torture could not be repeated unless in case of retractation. 
This led to the subtlety of calling a renewed torture a continuation,

and not a repetition. The rules of Torquemada and of Valdes are 
those of the greatest historical importance, the latter forming the 
code of the Holy Office until its suppression, not only in Spain, but 
in other countries where the Inquisition was established. But 
several other manuals of procedure existed before the final perfec- 
tion of the system by Vald£s. The earliest is perhaps the instruc- 
tions for inquisitors {Directorium inquisitorum) compiled a century 
earlier than Torquemada by Nicholas Eymerico, grand inquisitor 
of Aragon about 1368. 1 Rules of practice were also framed two 
centuries later by Simancas, whose position as an apologist has been 
already stated. The textbook of procedure of the Italian Inquisi- 
tion was the Sacro arsenate. 11 ^ In 1545 and 1550 instructions for the 
guidance of inquisitors were issued by Charles V. The liability of 
a judge for exceeding the law was not always recognized by the 
Inquisition to the same extent as by the Jay tribunals. Llorente 
gives an instance of a warrant by an inquisitor to a licentiate order- 
ing the torture of an accused person, and protesting that, in case 
of death or fracture of limbs, the fact is not to be imputed to the 
licentiate. 3 

Thus far of the law. In practice all the ingenuity of cruelty was 
exercised to find new modes of torment. 4 These cruelties led at 
times to remonstrance from the civil power. One example is the 
edict of Philip II. just mentioned. Anotherand an earlier one is 
an ordonnance of Philip the Fair, in 1302, bidding the Inquisition 
confine itself within the limits of the law. 6 At Venice the senate 
decreed that three senators should be present as inquisitors. 

As the practice of torture became more systematized, it grew to 
be the subject of casuistical inquiry by churchmen to an extent far 
exceeding the scanty discussion of the question in the text of the 
canon law. It will be sufficient here to cite as an example the treat- 
ment of it by Liguori, who incorporates the opinions of many of the 
Spanish casuists. On the whole, his views appear to be more humane 
than the prevailing practice. The object of torture he defines 
very neatly as being to turn semiplena into plena probatio. For 
this proper indicia are necessary. He then proceeds to decide 
certain questions which had arisen, the most interesting of which 
deal with the nature of the sin of which the accused and the judge 
are guilty in particular instances. A judge sins gravely if he does 
not attempt all milder means of discovering truth before resorting 
to torture. He sins in a criminal cause, or in one of notable infamy, 
if he binds the accused by oath to tell the truth before there is proof 
against him. It is the same if without oath he uses threats, terror 
or exhibition of torments to confound the witness. 6 If any one, to 
avoid grave torments, charges himself with a capital crime, he does 
not sin mortally. 7 It was a doubtful question whether he sinned 
gravely in such a case. Escobar at an earlier date supported the 
morally dangerous view that an inquisitor may follow a probable 
opinion in ordering torture, relinquishing a more probable. 8 

England. — It is the boast of the common law of England that it 
never recognized torture as legal. ^ One, perhaps the chief, reason 
for this position taken by the law is the difference of the nature of 
the procedure in criminal cases from that in general use in European 
countries. To use words more familiar in foreign jurisprudence, 
the English system is accusatorial as distinguished from inquisitorial. 
In the former the accuser has to prove guilt, in the latter the accused 
has to prove innocence. The common law of England has always 
shown itself averse from the inquisitorial system, and so (at least 
in theory) to the torture which may be regarded as an outcome of 
the system whose one end was to obtain a confession from the accused. 
The tendency of the small amount of statute law bearing on the 
subject is in the same direction. It was provided t>y Magna Carta, 
§ 29, " that no free man . . . should be destroyed in any way unless 
by legal judgment of his equals or by the law of the land." On 
this Sir E. Coke comments, " No man destroyed, &c, that is, fore- 
judged of life or limb, disinherited, or put to torture or death." 9 
The act of 27 Hen. VIII. c. 4 enacted that, owing to the frequent 
escape of pirates in trials by the civil law, " the nature ^whereof 
is that before any judgment of death can be given against the 
offenders they must plainly confess their offence (which they will 
never do without torture or pains)," such persons shoujd be tried 
by jury before commissioners under the Great Seal. Finally, the 
Bill of Rights provided that cruel and unusual punishments ought 
not to be inflicted. The opinions of the judges have been invariably 
against torture in theory, however much some of them may have

2 It was by Father Masini, and went through numerous editions 
(complete or compendia) from 1558 to 1730. Among other manuals

4 Among others were the^gradual pouring of water drop by drop

gauze into the stomach, and the pindola, or swinging pendulum, 
so graphically described in one of Edgar Poe's tales.

been led to countenance it in practice. The strongest authority 
is the resolution of the judges in Felton's case (1628), that he ought 
not by the law to be tortured by the rack, for no such punishment 
is known or allowed by our law." 10 In accordance with this are 
the opinions of Sir John Fortescue, 11 Sir Thomas Smith w and Sir 
E. Coke. The latter says, " As there is no law to warrant tortures 
in this land, nor can they be justified by any prescription, being 
so lately brought in." 13 In spite of all this, torture in criminal 
proceedings was inflicted in England with more or less frequency 
for some centuries, both as a means of obtaining evidence and as 
a part of the punishment. But it should be remarked that torture 
of the former kind was invariably ordered by the Crown or council, 
or by some tribunal of extraordinary authority, such as the Star 
Chamber, not professing to be bound by the rules of the common 
law. In only two instances was a warrant to torture issued to a 
common law judge. 14 

A licence to torture is found as early as the Pipe Roll of 34 Hen. II. 15 
The Templars were tortured in 1310 by royal warrant addressed 
to the mayor and sheriffs of London. 16 In this case it is recorded that 
torture^ was unknown in England, and that no torturer was to be 
found in the realm. 17 A commission was issued concerning the 
tortures at Newgate in 1334. 18 The rack in the Tower is said to 
have been introduced by the duke of Exeter in the reign of Henry VI., 
and to have been thence called "the duke of Exeter's daughter." 19 
In this reign torture seems^ to have taken its place as a part of 
what may be called extraordinary criminal procedure, claimed, and 
it may be said tacitly recognized, as exercisable by virtue of the 
prerogative, and continued in use down to 1640. 20 The infliction 
of torture gradually became more common under the Tudor monarchs. 
Under Henry VIII. it appears to have been in frequent use. Only 
two cases are recorded under Edward VI., and eight under Mary. 21 
The reign of Elizabeth was its culminating point. In the words 
of Hallam, " the rack seldom stood idle in the Tower for all the 
latter part of Elizabeth's reign." 22 The varieties of torture used at 
this period are fully described by Dr Lingard, 23 and consisted of 
the rack, the scavenger's daughter, 24 the iron gauntlets or bilboes, 
and^ the cell called " Little Ease." The registers of the council 
during the Tudor and early Stuart reigns are full of entries as to 
the use of torture, both for state and for ordinary offences. 26 Among 
notable prisoners put to the torture were Anne Askew, the Jesuit 
Campion, Guy Fawkes 26 and Peacham (who was examined by Bacon 
11 before torture, in torture and after torture "). 27 The prevalence 
of torture in Elizabeth's reign led to the well-known defence at- 
tributed to Lord Burghley, " A declaration of the favourable dealing 
of Her Majesty's commissioners appointed for the examination of 
certain traitors, and of tortures unjustly reported to be done upon 
them for matter of religion," 1583. 28 The use of torture in England 
being always of an extraordinary and extra-judicial nature, it is

u Commonwealth of England, bk. ii. c. 27 (1583; ed. by L. Alston,

was directed by a warrant under the queen's seal alone (not through 
the council) to torture the duke of Norfolk's servants in 1571. In 
a letter to Lord Burghley he pleaded for exemption from so hateful 
a task.

wealth (Thurioe iii. 298).

of an ordinary nature, and afford no ground for the assertions made 
by Strutt and Bishop Burnet that torture was used to heretics as 
heretics.

24 These two were exactly opposite in principle. The rack stretched 
the limbs of the sufferer; the scavenger's daughter compressed him 
into a ball. 

25 Fifty-five of these will be found in the appendix to Mr Jardine's 
work. An ordinary robber of plate was threatened with torture 
in 1567. — Froude, Hist, of England, viii. 386. 

26 It is not certain whether he was racked, but probably he was, 
in accordance with the king's letter: " If he will not otherwise confess 
the gentlest tortures are to be first used to him, and so on, step by 
step, to the most severe, and so God speed the good work."

TORTURE 



comparatively certain that it could hardly have been applied with 
that observation of forms which existed in countries where it was 
regulated by law. There were no rules^ and no responsibility beyond 
the will of the Crown or council. This irresponsibility is urged by 
Selden L as a strong objection to the use of torture. The main 
differences between the infliction of torture in England and on the 
continent of Europe seemto be that English lawyers made no dis- 
tinction of those liable to it, never allowed torture of witnesses, and 
elaborated no subtle rules as to plena and semiplena probatio. 

So far of what may be called torture proper, to which the common 
law professed itself a stranger. There were, however, cases fully 
recognized by the common law which differed from torture only 
in name. The peine forte et dure was a notable example of this. 
If a prisoner stood mute of ^ malice instead of pleading, he was 
condemned to the peine, that is, to be stretched upon his back and 
to have iron laid upon him as much as he could bear, and more, 
and so to continue^ fed upon bad bread and stagnant water through 
alternate days until he pleaded or died. 2 It was abolished by 12 
Geo. III. c. 20. 7 and 8 Geo. IV. c. 28 enacted that a plea of " not 
guilty " should be entered for a prisoner so standing mute. A case 
of peine occurred as lately as 1726. At times tying the thumbs 
with whip-cord was used instead of the peine. This was said to be 
a common practice at the Old Bailey up to the 18th century. 3 In 
trials for witchcraft the legal proceedings often partook of the 
nature of torture, as in the throwing of the reputed witch into a 
pond to see whether she would sink or swim, in drawing her blood, 4 
and in thrusting pins into the body to try to find the insensible spot. 
Confessions, too, appear to have been often extorted by actual 
torture, and torture of an unusual nature, as the devil was supposed 
to protect his votaries from the effects of ordinary torture. 

Torture as a part of the punishment existed in fact, if not in 
name, down to a very recent period. Mutilation as a punishment 
appears in some of the pre-Conquest codes, such as those of Alfred, 
iEthelstan and Canute, in the laws attributed to William the 
Conqueror and in the assize of Northampton (1176). Bracton, who 
does not notice torture as a means of obtaining evidence, divides 
corporal punishment into that inflicted with and without torture. 5 
Later instances are the punishment of burning to death inflicted 
on heretics under the Six Articles (31 Hen. VIII. c. 14) and other 
acts, and on women for petit treason (abolished by 30 Geo. III. 
c. 48), the mutilation inflicted for violence in a royal palace by 
33 Hen. VIII. c. 12, the punishment for high treason, which 
existed nominally until 1870, the pillory (abolished by 7 Will. IV. 
and 1 Vict. c. 23), the stocks, branks and cucking-stool, and the 
burning in the hand for felony (abolished by 19 Geo. III. c. 74). 
Corporal punishment now exists only in the case of juvenile 
offenders and of robbery with violence. It was abolished in the 
army by the Army Act 1881. 6 Crueltyin punishment did not 
entirely cease in prisons even after the Bill of Rights. See such 
cases as R. v. Huggins, 1 7 State Trials, 298 ; Castell v. Bambridge, 
2 Strange's Rep. 856. 

Scotland. — Torture was long a recognized part of Scottish criminal 
procedure, and was acknowledged as such by many acts and warrants 
of the^ Scottish' parliament and warrants of the Crown and the privy 
council. Numerous instances occur in the Register of the Privy 
Council. 1 Two acts in 1640, dealt with^ torture ; one took the form 
of a warrant to examine witnesses against William Barton by any 
form of probation, 8 the other of a warrant to a committee to inquire 
as to the use of torture against persons suspected of witchcraft.* 
The judges in 1689 were empowered by the estates to torture Chiesly 
of Dalrye, charged with the murder of the lord president Lockhart, 
in order to discover accomplices. In the same year the use of torture 
without evidence or in ordinary cases was declared illegal in the 
Claim of Right. The careful wording of this will be noticed: it 
does not object to torture altogether, but reserves it for cases where 
a basis of evidence had already been laid, and for crimes of great 
gravity, thus admitting the dangerous principle, founded on Roman 
taw, that the importance of the crime is a reason for departing from 
the ordinary rules of justice. However great the crime, it is no 
more certain than in the case of a crime of less gravity that the 
person accused was the person who committed it. A warrant issued 
in the same year to put to the torture certain persons accused of 
conspiring against the government, and also certain dragoons 
suspected of corresponding with Lord Dundee. In 1690 an act 
passed reciting the torture of William Carstares, a minister, in 1683, 
and re-establishing his competency as a witness. 10 The last warrant 
appears to be one in 1690 for torturing a man accused of rape and 
murder. In 1708 torture in Scotland was finally abolished by 7

Anne c. 21, s 5. Many details of the tortures inflicted will be found 
in Pitcairn's Criminal Trials, the introduction to J. Maclaurins' 
R. Criminal Cases and J. H. Burton's Narratives from Criminal 
Trials. Among other varieties — the nature of some of them can 
only be guessed — were the rack, the pilniewinkis, the boot, u the 
caschie-laws, the lang irnis, the narrow-bore, the pynebankis, and 
worst of all, the waking, or artificial prevention of sleep. 12 The 
ingenuity of torture was exercised in a special degree on charges 
of witchcraft, notably in the reign of James VI., an expert both in 
witchcraft and in torture. # The act of 1649 already cited shows 
that the principle survived him. Under the government of the dukes 
of Lauderdale and York torture as a practice in charges of religious 
and political offences reached its height. " The privy council was 
accustomed to extort confessions by torture; that grim divan of 
bishops, lawyers and peers sucking in the groans of each undaunted 
enthusiast, in hope that some imperfect avowal might lead to the 
sacrifice of other victims, or at least warrant the execution of the 
present." 13 With such examples before them in the law, it is scarcely 
to be wondered at that persons in positions of authority, especially 
the nobility, sometimes exceeded the law and inflicted torture at 
their own will and for their own purposes. There are several 
instances in the Register of the Privy Council of suits against such 
persons, e.g. against the earl of Orkney, in 1605, for putting a son 
of Sir Patrick Bellenden in the boots. 

Ireland seems to have enjoyed comparative immunity from torture. 
It was not recognized by the common or statute law, and the cases 
of its infliction do not appear to be numerous. In 1566 the president 
and council of Munster, or any three of them, were empowered to 
inflict torture, " in cases necessary, upon vehement presumption 
of any great offence in any party committed against the Queen's 
Majesty." 14 In 1583 Hurley, an Irish priest, was tortured in Dublin 
by toasting his feet against the fire with hot boots." 15 In 1627 the 
lord deputy doubted whether he had authority to put a priest 
named O'Cullenan to the rack. An answer was returned by Lord 
Killultagh to the effect that " you ought to rack him if you saw cause 
and hang him if you found reason." w The latest case of peine forte 
et dure seems to have been in 1740. 

British^ Colonies and Dependencies.— -The infliction of torture in 
any British colony or dependency has usually been regarded as 
contrary to law, and ordered only by arbitrary authority. It is 
true that in the trial of Sir Thomas Picton in 1806, for subjecting, 
while governor of Trinidad, a woman named Luisa Calderon to the 
torture of the picquet, 17 one of the grounds of defence was that such 
torture was authorized by the Spanish law of the island, but the 
accused was convicted in spite of this defence, and the final decision 
of the cofirt of king's bench, in 1812, decreeing a respite of the 
defendant's recognizances till further order, was perhaps not so 
much an affirmation of the legality in the particular instance as 
the practical expression of a wish to spare an eminent public servant. 18 
As to India, the second charge against Warren Hastings was extortion 
from the begums of Oude by means of the torture of their servants. 19 
In the present Indian Penal Code and Evidence Acts there are 
provisions intended, as Sir James Stephen says, 20 to prevent the 
practice of torture by the police for the purpose of extracting con- 
fessions from persons in their custody. 21 In Ceylon torture, which 
had been allowed under the Dutch government, was expressly 
abolished by royal proclamation in 1799. 

In the Channel Islands confessions of persons accused of witch- 
craft in the 17th century were frequently obtained by torture. 22 

United States— ^One instance 01 the peine forte et dure is known. 
It was inflicted in 1692 on Giles Cory of Salem, who refused to 
plead when arraigned for witchcraft. 23 The constitution of the 
United States provides, in the words of the Bill of Rights, that 
cruel and^ unusual punishments are not to be inflicted. 24 This is 
repeated in the constitutions of most states. The infliction of cruel 
and unusual punishment by the master or officer of an American 
vessel on the high seas, or within the maritime jurisdiction of the 
United States, is punishable with fine or imprisonment, or both. 26 
There have been a good many decisions on the question of cruel 
and unusual punishments; e.g. Wilkerson v. Utah, 99 U.S. Rep. 130; 

11 Persons subjected to more than usual torture from the boot 
were said to be " extremely booted."

Continental European States. — These fall into four main groups, 
the Latin, Teutonic, Scandinavian and Slav states respectively. 
The principles of Roman law were generally adopted in the first 
and second groups. 

Latin States. — In France torture does not seem to have existed 
as a recognized practice before the 13th century. From that period 
until the 1 7th century it was regulated by a series of royal ordonnances 
at first of local obligation, afterwards applying to the whole kingdom. 
Torture was used only by the royal courts, its place in the seigneurial 
courts being supplied by the judicial combat. The earliest ordonnance 
on the subject was that of Louis IX. in 1254 for the reformation of 
the law in Languedoc. It enacted that persons of good fame, though 
poor, were not to be put to the question on the evidence of one 
witness. 1 Numerous other provisions were made between 1254 
and 1670, when an ordonnance was passed under Louis XIV., which 
regulated the infliction of torture for more than a century. Two 
kinds were recognized, the question priparatoire and the question 
prialable. The first was used where strong evidence of a capital 
crime — strong, but of itself insufficient for conviction—was produced 
against the accused. The second was used to obtain^ a confession 
of accomplices after conviction. There was also a mitigated torm 
called the presentment, in which the accused was simply bound 
upon the rack in terrorem and there interrogated. No person was 
exempt on the ground of dignity, but exemption was allowed to 
youths, old men, sick persons and others. Counsel for the accused 
were usually not allowed. The question priparatoire was abolished 
by royal decree in 1780, but in 1788 the parliaments refused to 
register a decree abolishing the prialable. But torture of all kinds 
was abolished by an ordonnance in 1789. The Declaration of Right 
in 1 791 (art. viii.) affirmed that the law ought not to establish any 
punishments other than such as are strictly and evidently necessary. 
In modern law the code pinal enacts that all criminals shall be 
punished as guilty of assassination who for the execution of their 
crimes employ torture. 2 The code also makes it punishable to 
subject a person under arrest to torture. 8 The theory of semiplena 
probatio was worked out with more refinement than in other systems. 
In some parts of France not only were half-proofs admitted, but 
quarters and eighths of proofs. 4 Among the numerous cases of 
historical interest were those of the Templars in 1307, Villon about 
1457, Dolet in 1546, the marquise de Bnnvilliers in 1676 and Jean 
Calas in 1762. 6 

The law as it existed in Italy is contained in a long line of authorities 
chiefly supplied by the school of Bologna, beginning with the 
glossatores and coming down through the post-glossatores f until the 
system attained its perfection in the vast work of Farinaccius, 
written early in the 17th century, where every possible question 
that could arise is treated with a revolting completeness. One 
of the earliest jurists to treat it was Cino da Pistoia, the friend of 
Dante. 6 He treats it at no great length. With him the theory of 
indicia exists only in embryo, as they cannot be determined by law 
but must be at the discretion of the judge. Differing from Bartolus, 
he affirms that torture cannot be repeated without fresh indicia. 
The writings of jurists were supplemented by a large body of legis- 
lative enactments in most of the Italian states, extending from the 
constitutions of the emperor Frederick II. down to the 18th century. 
It is not until Bartolus (1314-1357) that the law begins to assume 
a definite and complete form. In his commentary on book xlviii. 
of the Digest he follows Roman law closely, but introduces some 
further refinements: e.g. though leading questions # may not be 
asked in the main inquiry they are admissible as subsidiary. There 
is a beginning of classification of indicia. A very full discussion 
of the law is contained in the work on practice of Hippolytus de 
Marsiliis, 7 a jurist of Bologna, notorious, on his own admission, as 
the inventor of the torture of keeping without sleep. He defines 
the question as inquisitio veritatis per tormenta et cordis dolorem, 
thus recognizing the mental as well as the physical elements in 
torture. It was to be used only in capital cases and atrocious crimes. 
The works of Farinaccius and of Julius Clarus nearly a century later 
were of great authority from the high official positions filled by the 
writers. Farinaccius was procurator-general to Pope Paul V., 
and his discussion of torture is one of the most complete of any. 6 
It occupies 251 closely printed folio pages with double columns. 
The length at which the subject is treated is one of the best proofs

of the science to which it had been reduced. The chief feature of 
the work is the minute and skilful analysis of indicia, jama, prae- 
sumptio, and other technical terms. Many definitions of indicium 
arc suggested, the best perhaps being conjectura ex probabilibus et non 
necessariis orta, a quibus potest abesse Veritas sed non verisimilitudo. 
For every infliction of torture a distinct indicium is required. 
A single witness or an accomplice constitutes an indicium* 
But this rule does not apply where it is inflicted for discovering 
accomplices or for discovering a crime other than that for which 
it^ was originally inflicted. Torture may beordered^ in all 
criminal cases, except small offences, and in certain civil 
cases; such as denial of a depositum, bankruptcy, usury, 
treasure trove, and ^ fiscal cases. It may be inflicted on all 
persons,' unless specially exempted (clergy, minors, &c), and 
even those exempted may be tortured by command of the 
sovereign. There are three kinds of torture, levis, gravis and 
gravissima, the first and second corresponding to the ordinary 
torture of French writers, the last to the extraordinary. The 
extraordinary or gravissima was as much as could possibly be borne 
without destroying life. The judge could not begin with torture; 
it was only a subsidium. If inflicted without due course of law, 
it was void as a proof. The judge was liable to penalties if he 
tortured without proper indicia, if a privileged person, or if to the 
extent that death or permanent illness was the result. An immense 
variety of tortures is mentioned, and the list tended to grow, for, as 
Farinaccius says, judges continually invented new modes of torture 
to please themselves. Numerous casuistical questions are treated 
at length, such as, what kinds of reports or how much hearsay 
evidence constituted fame? Were there three or five grades in 
torture? Julius Clarus of Alessandria was a member of the council 
of Philip II. To a great extent he follows Farinaccius.* He puts 
the questions for the consideration of the judge with great clearness. 
They are — whether (1) a crime has been committed, (2) the charge 
is one in which torture is admissible, (3) the fact can be proved other- 
wise, (4) the crime was secret or open, (5) the object of the torture 
is to elicit confession of crime or discovery of accomplices. The 
clergy can be tortured only in charges of treason, poisoning and 
violation of tombs. Qn the great question whether there are three 
or five grades, he decides in favour of five, viz. threats, taking to the 
place of torment, stripping and binding, lifting on the rack, racking.* 
Other Italian writers of less eminence have been referred to for the 
purposes of this article. The burden of their writings is practically 
the same, but they have not attained the systematic perfection of 
Farinaccius. Citations from many of them are made by Manzoni 
(see below)* Among others are Guido de Suzara, Paris de Puteo, 
Aegidius Bossius of Milan, Casonus of Venice, Decianus, Follerius 
and Tranquillus Ambrosianus, whose works cover the period from the 
13th to the end of the 17th century. The law depended mainly 
on the writings of the jurists as interpreters of custom. ^ At the 
same time in all or nearly all the Italian states and colonies 10 the 
customary law was limited, supplemented, or amended by legislation. 
That a check by legislative authority was necessary appears from 
the glimpses afforded by the writings of the jurists that trie letter of 
the Taw was by no means always followed. The earliest legislation 
after the Roman law seems to be the constitutions of the emperor 
Frederick II. for Sicily promulgated in 1231. Torture was abolished 
in Tuscany in 1786, largely owing to the influence of Beccaria, whose 
work first appeared in 1764, and other states followed, but the puntale 
or piquet seems to have existed in practice at Naples up to 1859. 

Several instances of the torture of eminent persons occur in Italian 
history, such as Savonarola, Machiavelli, Giordano Bruno, Cam- 
panella. Galileo appears to have only been threatened with the 
esame rigoroso. The historical case of the greatest literary interest 
is that of the persons accused of bringing the plague into Milan 
in 1630 by smearing the walls of houses with poison. An analysis 
of the case was undertaken by Verri 11 and Manzoni, 12 and puts in a 
clear light some of the abuses to which the system led in times of 
popular panic. Convincing arguments < are urged by Manzoni, 
after an exhaustive review of the authorities, to prove the ground- 
lessness of the charge on which two innocent persons underwent 
the torture of the canape, or hempen cord (the effect of which was 
partial or complete dislocation of the wrist), and afterwards suffered * 
death by breaking on the wheel. The main arguments, shortly 
stated, are these, all based upon the evidence as recorded, and the 
law as laid down by jurists. (1) The unsupported evidence of an 
accomplice was treated as an indicium in a case not one of those 
exceptional ones in which such an indicium was sufficient. The 
evidence of two witnesses or a confession by the accused was neces- 
sary to establish a remote indicium, such as r lying. (2) Hearsay 
evidence was received when primary evidence was obtainable. (3) 
The confession made under torture was not ratified afterwards. 
(4) It was made in consequence of a promise of impunity. (5) It 
was of an impossible crime.

TORTURE 



In Spain, as in Italy, the law depended partly on the writings of 
jurists, partly on legislation. Roman law was carried through the 
Visigothic Code and the Fuero juzgo 1 (which repeats it almost 
word for word) down to the Siete partidas. 2 This treatise, com- 
piled by Alphonso the Wise about 1243, but not promulgated till 
1256, amended the previously existing law in the direction of greater 
precision. Torment is defined as a manner of punishment which 
lovers of justice use, to scrutinize by it the truth of crimes committed 
secretly and not provable in any other manner. Repetition was 
allowed in case of grave crimes. There were the usual provisions 
for the infliction of torture only by a judge having jurisdiction, and 
for the liability of the judge for exceeding legal limits. Subsequent 
codes did little more than amend the Partidas in matters of pro- 
cedure. Torture is not named in the Ordenanzas reales of Ferdinand 
and Isabella (1485). The Nueva recopilacion of Philip II. enacted 
that torture was to be applied t>y the alcaldes on due sentence 
of the court — even on hidalgos in grave crimes — without regard 
to alleged privilege or custom. In the Novisima recopilacion 
of 1775 the only provisions on the subject are that the alcaldes 
are not to condemn to torment without preceding sentence 
according^ to law, and that hidalgos are not to be tormented 
or suffer infamous punishment. In Aragon, while it was an inde- 
pendent state, torture was not in use to the same extent as in other 
parts of Spain, It was abolished in the 13th century by the General 
Privilege of 1283 except in thecase of vagabonds charged with coin- 
ing. A statute of 1335 made it unlawful to put any freeman to the 
torture. 3 On the other hand, the Aragonese nobility had a power, 
similar to the peine forte et dure, of putting a criminal to death by 
cold, hunger and thirst. 4 The jurists dealing with the subject are 
not as numerous as in Italy, no doubt because Italian opinions were 
received as law in all countries whose systems were based on Roman 
law. 6 Some of the Italian jurists too, like Clarus, were at that 
same time Spanish officials. The earliest Spanish secular jurist 
appears to be Suarez de Paz. 8 According to him the most usual 
tortures in Spain were the water and cord, the pulley or strappado t 
the hot brick, and the tablillas, or thumbscrew and boot combined. 
Three was the greatest number of times that any torture could be 
applied. It might .be decreed either on demand of the accuser or 
at will of the judge. The Roman rule of beginning with the weakest 
was amplified into a series of regulations that a son was to be put 
to the question before a father^ a woman before a man, &c. The 
fullest statement of Spanish law is to be found in the work of Antonio 
Gomez, a professor at Salamanca. 7 With him no exceptions apply 
in charges of iaesa majestas divina or humana. A judge is liable 
to different punishment according as he orders torture dolose or 
culpabiliter. Differing from Hippolytus de Marsiliis, Gomez holds 
that the dying accusation of a murdered man is not an indicium. 
A confession on insufficient indicia is void. His division of torture 
into tortura actualis and terror propinquus is the same as that of 
the French jurists into torture and presentment. The conclusions 
of the ecclesiastical writers of Spain, such as Eymerico and Simancas, 
were accepted wholly or partially by the secular writers, such as 
Alvarez de Velasco, 8 and the Peruvian, Juan de He via Bolanos,* 
who points out differences in the ecclesiastical and secular systems, 
e.g. the former brought up the accused for ratification in three days, 
the latter in twenty-four hours. A good deal of the Spanish law 
will be found in the proceedings against Sir Thomas Picton (see 
above). Torture in Spain seems to have been inflicted on Jews to 
an extraordinary extent, as it was also in Portugal, where the latest 
legislation as to torture seems to be of the year 1678. In 1790 it 
had become obsolete, 10 and in a work on criminal procedure four 
years later it is only referred to for the purpose of stating that when 
it did exist it was realis or verbolis. 11

6 In all tne Latin countries the idea of torture had become a 
commonplace. The dramatists contain frequent allusions to it. 
In Lope de Vega's El Perro del hortelano (" The Dog in the Manger "), 
one of the characters says, " Here's a pretty inquisition!" to which 
the answer is, " The torture will be next applied." Moliere and 
Racine both make use of it. In VAvare, act iv. sc. 7, Harpagon 
threatens to put his whole household to the question. In Les 
Plaideurs Dandin invites Isabelle to see la question as a mode of 
passing an hour or two. In England Bacon (Essay lvi.) says, 
" There is no worse torture than the torture of laws." The same 
idea occurs again in the Advancement of Learning, viii. 3, 13, " It 
is a cruel thing to torture the laws that they may torture men,"

on the subject. The principal writers are Langer, von Rosbach 
and von Boden. In addition may be cited the curious Layenspiegel 
of Ulrich Tengler (1544), and the works of Remus, Casonus and 
Carpzow." Legislation was partly for the empire, partly for its 
component states. Imperial legislation dealt with the matter in 
the Golden Bull (1356), the Ordinance of Bamberg (1507), the 
Carolina (1532) 13 and the Constitutio criminalis theresiana (1768). u 
The Carolina followed the usual lines, the main difference being 
that the infliction must be in the presence of two scabini and a 
notary, who was to make a detailed record of the proceedings. The 
code of Maria Theresa defines torture as " a subsidiary means of 
eliciting truth." It could be applied only in cases where condemna- 
tion would have involved capital or severe corporal punishment. 
The illustrated edition was suppressed by Prince Kaunitz a few 
days^ after its appearance. Torture was formally abolished in the 
empire in 1776. In Prussia it was practically abolished by Frederick 
the Great in 1740, formally in 1805. Even before its abolition it 
was in use only to discover accomplices after conviction. 16 In 
some other states it existed longer^ in Baden as late as 183 1. It 
was carried toexcess in Germany, as in the Netherlands and Scotland 
in charges of witchcraft. 

The Netherlands. — The principal legislative enactment was the 
code of criminal procedure promulgated by Philip II. in 1570 and 
generally known as the Ordonnance sur le style.™ One of its main 
objects was to assimilate the varieties of local custom, as the Nueva 
recopilacion had done in Spain three years earlier. The French 
ordonnance of 1670 is probably largely based on it. In spite of 
the attempt of the ordinance to introduce uniformity, certain cities 
of Brabant, it is said^ still claimed the privilege of torturing in 
certain cases not permitted by the ordinance, e.g. where there was 
only one witness. 17 

The law of 1670 continued to be the basis of crTrmftal procedure 
in the Austrian Netherlands until 1787. In the United Provinces 
it was not repealed until 1798. The principal I text-writers are 
Damhouder, 18 van Leeuwen 19 and Voet. Van Lequwen lays down 
as a fundamental principle that no one was to be condemned to 
death without confession, and such confession, if attainable in no 
other way, ought to be elicited by torture. Witnesses could be 
tortured only if they varied on confrontation. One of the indicia 
not always recognized by jurists was previous conviction for a similar 
crime. Voet's commentary ad Pandectas™ is interesting for its 
taking the same view as St Augustine as to the uselcssness of torture, 
and compares its effect with that of the trial by battle. At the 
same time he allows it to be of some value in the case of very grave 
crimes. The value of torture was doubted by others as well as 
Voet, e.g. by A. Nicholas 21 and by van Essen. 22 At the same time a 
writer was found to compose a work on the unpromising subject 
of the rack, 23 

Scandinavian Countries. — There is a notice of torture in the Ice- 
landic Code known as the Gragas (about 1119). Judicial torture 
is said to have been introduced into Denmark by Valdemar I, in 
1 157. 24 In the code of Christian V. (1683) it was limited to cases of 
treason. 26 It was abolished by the influence of Struensee in 1771, 
but notwithstanding this he was threatened with it, though it was 
not actually inflicted, before his execution in 1772. In Sweden 
torture never existed as a system, and in the code of 1734 it was. 
expressly forbidden. 2 ^ It was however occasionally inflicted, as 
in England, by extrajudicial authorities, called secret committees.

TORUS— TOTEMISM 



79 



The " cave of roses," where reptiles were kept for the purpose of 
torture, was closed by Gustavus III. in 1772. 

Slav Countries. — The earliest mention of torture seems to be that 
of the mutilation provided for certain offences by the code of Stephen 
Dushan ^13*19. In Russia torture does not occur in the recensions 
of the earlier law. It was possibly of Tatar origin , and the earliest 
mention of it in an official document is probably in the Sudebnik 
of Ivan the Terrible (1497). In the ordinance of 1556 there are 
elaborate regulations, which one learns from history were not always 
observed in periods of political disturbance^ and torture seems to 
have been used even as a means of enforcing payment of debts. 
The reaction begins with Peter the Great and culminates with 
Catharine II., who was largely influenced by the opinions of Beccaria 
and Voltaire. In the instructions to the commission for framing 
a criminal code (1766), it is declared that all punishments by which 
the body is maimed ought to be abolished, 1 and that the torture 
of the rack violates the rules of equity and does not produce the end 
proposed by the laws. 2 It was formally abolished by Alexander I. 
in 1801, and in 1832 the Svod Zakonov subjected to penalties any 
judge who presumed to order it. But even as late as 1847 it seems 
to have been inflicted in one or two exceptional cases. 3 

Authorities. — For England Jardine's is still the standard work. 
Much general information and numerous authorities will be found 
in Lipenius, Bibliotheca realis Juridica, s.v. " Tortura " (Frankfort, 
1679), and in the more modern work of J. Helbing, Die Tortur 
(Berlin, 1902). For those whocan obtain access to it the catalogue 
issued at the sale of M. G. Libri (1861) is valuable. He had collected 
most of the books on the subject. There are several publications 
dealing with cases of individuals in addition to the numerous ones 
on witchcraft trials, e.g. those of William Lithgow, the Amboyna 
case, Dellon and Van Halen. Lithgow' s story has been republished 
(Glasgow, 1907). (J. W.) 

TORUS, a Latin word, meaning a round swelling or pro- 
tuberance, applied to a convex moulding in architecture, which 
in section is generally a semicircle. The earliest examples 
are found in Egypt, where it was carried up the angles of the 
pylon and temple walls and horizontally across the same. Its 
most frequent employment is in the bases of columns; in the 
Roman Doric order being the lowest moulding; in the Ionic 
orders there are generally two torus mouldings separated by a 
scotia with fillets. Both in Greek and Roman bases sometimes 
the torus is elaborately carved. (See Moulding.) 

TORZHOK, a town of Russia, in the government of Tver, 
on the river Tvertsa, 21 m. by rail S.W. of the Likhoslavl, 
station of the St Petersburg & Moscow railway. Pop. (1900), 
15,119. It dates from the nth century, and thename (market- 
place) shows that this dependency of Novgorod was a commercial 
centre. It was fortified with a stone wall, which only partially 
protected it from the attacks of Mongols, Lithuanians and 
Poles. Torzhok is celebrated in Russia for its embroidered 
velvet and embroidered leather-work, for the manufacture of 
travelling bags, and for its trade in corn and flour. 

TOSCANELLA (anc. Tuscana, q.v.), a town of the province of 
Rome, Italy, 15 m. N.E. of Corneto by road, 545 ft. above sea- 
level. Pop. (1901), 4839. The medieval walls with their towers 
are still preserved. On the ancient citadel hill is the Romanesque 
church of S. Pietro, belonging to four different periods — 739, 
1093 (the date of the reconstruction of the crypt), the middle of 
the 12th and the end of the 12th century. It has the shape of a 
Roman basilica, with a nave and two aisles and one apse. The 
elaborate facade with its rose window also belongs to the 12th 
century. S. Maria in the valley below dates from 1050 to 1206, 
and has a similar facade and a massive square campanile. In 
the town are two other Romanesque churches.

TOSTIG (d. 1066), earl of Northumbria, was a son, probably 
the third, of Earl Godwine, and in 1051 married Judith, sister 
or daughter of Baldwin V., count of Flanders. In the year of 
his marriage he shared the short exile of his father, returning 
with him to England in 1052, and became earl of Northumbria 
after the death of Earl Siward in 1055. He was very intimate 
with his brother-in-law, Edward the Confessor, and in 1061 he 
visited Pope Nicholas II. at Rome in the company of Aldred, 
archbishop of York. By stern and cruel measures Tostig

introduced a certain amount of order into the wild northern 
district under his rule; this severity made him exceedingly 
unpopular, and in 1065 Northumbria broke into open revolt. 
Declaring Tostig an outlaw and choosing Morkere in his stead, 
the rebels marched southwards and were met at Oxford by 
Earl Harold, who, rather against the will of the king, granted 
their demands. Tostig sailed to Flanders and thence to Nor- 
mandy, where he offered his services to Duke William, who 
was related to his wife and who was preparing for his invasion of 
England. He then harried the Isle of Wight and the Kentish 
and Lincolnshire coasts, and, after a stay in Scotland and possibly 
a visit to Norway, joined another invader, Harald III. Hardrada, 
king of Norway, in the Tyne. Together they sailed up the Hum- 
ber and at Gate Fulford, near York, defeated Earls Morkere 
and Edwine and entered York. But Harold, now king, was 
hurrying to the north. Taking the Norwegians by surprise 
at Stamford Bridge he destroyed their army on the 25th of 
September 1066, and in this battle both Tostig and the king of 
Norway were slain. Tostig's two sons appear to have taken refuge 
in Norway, and his widow Judith married Welf, duke of Bavaria.

TOTANA, a town of eastern Spain, in the province of Murcia, 
on the Lorca-Murcia railway. Pop. (1900), 13,703. The 
town, which consists of two parts, the Barrio de Sevilla and 
Barrio de Triana, contains several handsome public buildings, 
among them the church of Santiago, with its three naves. Water 
is conveyed to To tana from the Sierra de Espuna by an aqueduct 
7 m. long. Saltpetre is obtained among the hills, and there 
is a thriving trade in wheat, oranges, olives, almonds, and wine 
from the Sangonera valley. Other industries are the manufac- 
ture of linen, leather and the earthenware jars called linajas, 
which are used for the storage of oil and wine. 

TOTEMISM, The word " totem " is used in too many varying 
senses by students of early society and religion. The term 
came into the English language in the form of " totam," through 
a work of 1791* by J. Long, an interpreter between the whites 
and the Red Indians of North America. 4 Long himself 
seems to have used the word to denote the protective familiar, 
usually an animal, which each Indian selected for himself, 
generally through the monition of a dream during the long 
fast of lads at their initiation. Such selected (or, when bestowed 
by medicine-men or friends, " given ") totems are styled 
" personal totems "and have no effect in savage law, nor are 
they hereditary, with any legal consequences. 

In stricter terminology " totem " denotes -the object, gene- 
rally of a natural species, animal or vegetable, but occasionally 
rain, cloud, star, wind, which gives its name to a kindred 
actual or supposed, among many savages and barbaric races in 
America, Africa, Australia and Asia and the isles. Each 
child, male or female, inherits this name, either from its 
mother ("female descent") or from its father (" male descent "). 
Between each person and his or her name-giving object, a 
certain mystic rapport is supposed to exist. -Where descent 
wavers, persons occasionally have, in varying degrees, the 
totems of both parents. 

Religious Aspect of the Toletn. — As a rule, by no means in- 
variable, the individual may not kill or eat the name-giving 
object of his kin, except under dire necessity; while less usually 
it is supposed to protect him and to send him monitory dreams. 
This is the " religious " or semi-religious aspect of the totem, 
or this aspect is, by some students, called " religious." 

We also hear of customs of burying and lamenting dead ani- 
mals which are regarded with reverence by this or that " family," 
or " clan." This custom is reported among the Samoans, and 
one " clan " was said to offer first-fruits to its sacred animal, 
the eel; while the " clan " that revered the pigeon kept and fed 
a tame specimen. 5 But 'in Samoa, though the sacred animals

TOTEMISM 



of " clan " or " family " gods, and therefore receive honours 
not paid to the hereditary totems of Australia and North 
America, which have nothing godlike. It is to be presumed that 
" totem dances " in which some Australian tribes exhibit, in 
ballets (Taction, the incidents of a myth concerning the totem, 
are, in a certain sense, " religious "; when they are not magical, 
and intended to foster and fertilize the species, animal or 
vegetable or other to which the totem belongs. 

The magical performances for the behoof of the totem crea- 
tures may be studied in the chapters on " Intichiuma " in Messrs 
Spencer and Gillen's Native Tribes of Central Australia, and 
Native Tribes of Northern Australia. Among the many guesses 
at the original purpose of totemism, one has been that the 
primal intention of totem sets of human beings was to act as 
magical co-operative stores for supplying increased quantities 
of food to the tribe. But this opinion has gone the way of 
other conjectures. The " religious " status of the totem is 
lowest among peoples where its influence on social regulations 
is greatest, and vice versa, a topic to which we recur. 

There are also various rites, in various tribes, connecting the 
dead man with his totem at his funeral; perhaps at his initia- 
tion, when a boy, into the esoteric knowledge and rules of his 
tribe. Men may identify themselves with their totems, or, 
mark themselves as of this or that totem by wearing the hide 
or the plumage of the bird or beast, or by putting on a mask 
resembling its face. The degree of " religious " regard for the 
revered object increases in proportion as it is taken to contain 
the spirit of an ancestor or to be the embodiment of a god: 
ideas not found among the most backward savages. 

The supreme or superior being of low savage religion or 
mythology is never a totem. He may be able, like Zeus in 
Greek mythology, to assume any shape he pleases; and in the 
myths of some Australian tribes he ordained the institution of 
totemism. Byamee, among the Euahlayi tribe of north-west New 
South Wales, had all the totems in him, and when he went to 
his paradise, Bullimah, he distributed them, with the mar- 
riage rules, among his people. 1 In other legends, especially 
those of central and northern Australia, the original totem 
creatures, animal in form, with bestial aspect, were developed in a 
marine or lacustrine environment, and from them were evolved 
the human beings of each totem kin. The rule of non-inter- 
marriage within the totem was, in some myths, of divine institu- 
tion; in others, was invented by the primitive wandering totemic 
beings; or was laid down by the wisdom of mere men who saw 
some unknown evil in consanguine unions. The strict regard 
paid to the rule may be called " religious "; in so far as totemists 
are aware of no secular and social raison d 9 tire of the rule it 
has a mysterious character. But whereas to eat the totem is 
sometimes thought to be automatically punished by sickness or 
death, this danger does not attach to marriage within the totem 
save in a single known case. The secular penalty alone is 
dreaded; so there seems to be no religious fear of offending a 
superior being, or the totem himself: no tabu of a mystic sort. 

Social Aspect of the Totem. — The totem has almost always a 
strong influence on or is associated with marriage law, and 
except in the centre of Australia, and perhaps in the little-known 
West, men and women of the same totem may not intermarry, 
" however far apart their hunting grounds," and though there is 
no objection on the score of consanguinity. 

This is the result, in Australia, of the custom, there almost 
universal, which causes each individual to belong, by birth, to 
one or other of the two main exogamous and intermarrying 
divisions of the tribe (usually called " phratries "). The phra- 
tries (often known by names of animals, as Eagle Hawk and 
Crow, Crow and White Cockatoo) contain each a number of 
totem kins, as Dog, Wild Cherry, Wombat, Frog, Owl, Emu, 
Kangaroo, and so on, and (except among the Arunta " nation " 
of five tribes in Central Australia) the same totem kin never 
occurs in both phratries. Thus as all persons except in the 
Arunta nation, marry out of their own phratry, none can marry 
into his or her totem kin. 

1 Mrs Langloh Parker, The Euahlayi Tribe. 



In some parts of North America the same rule prevails; with 
this peculiarity that the phratries, or main exogamous divisions, 
are not always two, as in Australia, but, for example, among 
the Mohegans three— Wolf, Turtle, and Turkey. 2 In Wolf 
all the totems are quadrupeds; under Turtle they are various 
species of turtles and the yellow eel; and under Turkey all 
the totems are birds. 

Clearly this ranking of the totems in the phratries is the result 
of purposeful design, not of accident. Design may also be 
observed in such phratries of Australian tribes as are named after 
animals of contrasted colours, such as White Cockatoo and 
Crow, Light Eagle Hawk and Crow. It has been supposed by 
Mr J. Mathew, Pere Schmidt and others that these Australian 
phratries arose in an alliance with connubium between a darker 
and a lighter race. 3 But another hypothesis is not less prob- 
able; and as we can translate only about a third of Australian 
phratry names, conjecture on this subject is premature. 

Both in Australia and America the animals, as EagleHawk and 
Crow, which give their names to the phratries, arc almost always 
totem kins within their own phratries. 4 

The Moquis of Arizona are said to have ten phratries, by 
Captain Ulick Bourke in his Snake Dance of the Moquis, but ■ 
possibly he did not use the term " phratry " in the sense which 
we attach to it. 

Among the Urabunna of Southern Central Australia, and 
among the tribes towards the Darling River, a very peculiar rule 
is said to prevail. There are two phratries, and in each are many 
totem kins, but each totem kin may intermarry with only one 
totem kin which must be in the opposite phratry. 5 Thus there 
are as many exogamous divisions as there are totems in the 
tribes, which reckon descent in the female line; children in- 
heriting the mother's totem only. Corroboration of these 
statements is desirable, as the tribes implicated are peculiarly 
" primitive," and theirs may be the oldest extant set of 
marriage rules. 

The existence of two or more main exogamous divisions, 
named or unnamed, is found among peoples where there are 
either no totem kins, or where they have fallen into the back- 
ground, as in parts of Melanesia, among the Todas and Meitchis 
of India and the Wanika in East Africa. 6 

An extraordinary case is reported from South Australia where 
people must marry in their own phratry, while their children 
belong to the opposite phratry. 7 This awaits corroboration. 

We now see some of the numerous varieties which prevail 
in the marriage rules connected with the totems. Even among 
a tribe whose members, it is reported, may marry into their 
own phratries, it appears that they must not marry within their 
own totem kins. This is, indeed, the rule wherever totemic 
societies are found in anything approaching to what we deem 
their most archaic constitution as in south-east Australia and' 
some tribes of North America. 

Exogamy: The Arunta Abnormality. — Meanwhile, in Central 
Australia, in the Arunta " nation," the rule forbidding marriage 
within the totem kin does not exist. Totems here are not, as 
everywhere else, inherited from either parent, but a child is of 
what we may call " the local totem " of the place where its 
mother first became conscious of its life within her. The idea 
is that the spirits of a primal race, in groups each of one totem 
only (" Alcheringa folk"), haunt various localities; or spirits 
(ratapa) emanating from these primal beings do so; they enter 
into passing married women, and are incarnated and born again.*

about the central, north, north-western and south-eastern forms of 



TOTEMISM 



81 



Thus if a woman, whatever her own totem, and whatever her 
husband's may be, becomes conscious of her child's life in a 
known centre of Wild Cat spirits, her child's totem is Wild Cat, 
and so with all the rest. 

As a consequence, a totem sometimes here appears in what 
the people caU the " wrong " (i.e. not the original) exogamous 
division; and persons may marry within their own totem name, 
if that totem be in the " right " exogamous division, which is not 
theirs. Each totem spirit is among the Arunta associated with 
an amulet or churinga of stone; these are of various shapes, and 
are decorated with concentric circles, spirals, cupules, and other 
archaic patterns. .These amulets are only used in this sense by 
the Arunta nation and their neighbours the Kaitish, " and it is 
this idea of spirit individuals associated with churinga and 
resident in certain definite spots that lies at the root of the present 

totemism. About the central Arunta tribe with its neighbours, the 
Urabunna, we have the evidence very carefully collected by Mr 
Gillen, a protector of the aborigines, and Professor Baldwin Spencer 
(Native Tribes of Central Australia). Concerning the peoples north 
from the centre to the Gulf of Carpentaria, the same scholars furnish 
a copious account in their Northern Tribes. These two explorers had 
the confidence of the blacks; witnessed their most secret ceremonies, 
magical and initiatory; and collected their legends. Their, books, 
however, contain no philological information as to the structure 
and interrelation of the dialects, information which is rarely to be 
found in the works of English observers in Australia. ^ As far as 
appears, the observers conversed with the tribes only in " pidgin 
English." If this be the case that lingua franca is current among 
some eighteen central-northern tribes speaking various ^ native 
dialects. We are told nothing about the languages used in each 
case; perhaps the Arunta men who accompanied the expedition 
arranged a system of interpreters. 

For the Dieri tribe, neighbours of the Urabunna, we have copious 
evidence in Native Tribes of South-East Australia by the late Mr 
A. W. Howitt, who studied the peoples for forty years; was made 
free of their initiatory ceremonies; and obtained intelligence from 
settlers in regions which he did not visit. We have also legends 
with Dieri texts and translations from the Rev. Mr Siebert, a mis- 
sionary among the Dieri. That tribe appears now to exist in a very 
dwindled condition under missionary supervision. The accounts 
of tribes from the centre to the south-east by Mr R. K. Mathew, 
are scattered in many English, Australian and American learned 
periodicals. Mr Mathew nas given a good deal of information 
about some of the dialects. His statements as to the line of descent 
and on other points among certain tribes are at variance with those 
of Messrs Spencer and Gillen (see an article by Mr A. R. Brown in 
Man, March 1910). Mr Mathew, however, does not enable us_to 
test the accuracy of his informants among the northern tribes, which 
is unfortunate. For the Aranda (or Arunta) of a region apparently 
not explored by Messrs Spencer and Gillen, and for the neighbouring 
Loritja tribe, we have Die Aranda und Loritja Stamme, two volumes 
by the Rev. C. Strehlow (Baer, Frankfurt am Main, 1907, 1908). 
Mr Strehlow is a German missionary who, after working among 
the Dieri and acquiring their language, served for many years among 
a branch of the Arunta (the Aranda), differing considerably in 
dialect, myths and usages from the Arunta of Messrs Spencer and 
Gillen. In some points, for example as to the primal ancestors 
and the spirits diffused by them for incarnation in human bodies, 
the Aranda and Loritja are more akin to the northern tribes than 
to Mr Spencer's Arunta. In other myths they resemble some 
south-eastern tribes reported on by Mr Howitt. Unlike the Arunta 
of Messrs Spencer and Gillen, but like the Arunta described by 
Mr Gillen earlier in The Horn ^Expedition, they believe in " a 
magnified non-natural man," Altjira, with a goose-foot, dwelling 
in the heavens. Unlike the self-created Atnatu of the Kaitish of 
Messrs Spencer and Gillen, he is not said^ to have created things, 
or to take any concern about human beings, as Atnatu does in 
matters ol ceremonial. Mr Strehlow gives Arandaand Lortija 
texts in the original, with translations and philological remarks. 

Mr Frazer, in his Totemism, makes no use of Mr Strehlow's 
information (save in a single instance). To us it seems worthy of 
study. His reason for this abstention is that, in a letter to him 
(Melbourne, March 10,1908), Mr Spencer says that for at least twenty 
years the Lutheran Missions have taught the natives " that altjira 
means ' god '; have taught that their sacred ceremonies and secular 
dances are * wicked '; have prohibited them, and have never seen 
them. Flour and tobacco, &c, are only given to natives who attend 
church and school. Natives have been married who, according 
to native customary law, belong to groups to which marriage is 
forbidden. For these reasons Mr Frazer cannot attempt " to 
filter the native liquor clear of its alien sediment," (Totemism, 
i. 186, note 2). 

Against this we may urge that, as regards the goose-footed sky- 
dweller, Mr Strehlow reports less of his active interest in human 
affairs than Mr Gillen does concerning his " Great Ulthaana of the 



totemic system of the Arunta," says Messrs Spencer and Gillen. 1 
Every Arunta born incarnates a pre-existent primal spirit 
attached to one of the stone churinga dropped by primal totemic 
beings, all of one totem in each case, at a place called an 
oknanikilla. Each child belongs to the totem of the primal 
beings of the place, where the mother became aware of the 
child's lif e. 

Thus the peculiar causes which have produced the unique 
Arunta licence of marrying within the totem are conspicuously 
obvious. 

Contradictory Theories aboulthe Arunla Abnormal Tolemtsm. — 
At this point theories concerning the origin of totemism begin 
to differ irreconcilably. Mr Frazer, Mr Spencer, and, apparently 
Dr Rivers, hold that, in Australia at least, totemism was 
originally " conceptional." It began in the belief by the women 
that pregnancy was caused by the entrance into them of some 
spirit associated with a visible object, usually animal or vegetable; 
while the child born, in each case, was that object. Hence that 
class of objects was tabued to the child; was its totem, but such 
totems were not hereditary. 

Next, for some unknown reason, the tribes were divided into 
two bodies or segments. The members of segment A may not 
intermarry; they must marry persons of segment B, and vice 
versa. Thus were evolved the primal forms of totemism and 
exogamy now represented in the law of the Arunta nation alone. 
Here, and here alone, marriage within the totem is permitted. 
The theory is, apparently, that , in all other exogamous and totemic 
peoples, totems had been, for various reasons, made hereditary, 
before exogamy was enforced by the legislator in his wisdom. 
Thus, all over the totemic world, except in the Arunta nation, 
the method of the legislator was simply to place one set of 
totem kins in tribal segment A, and the other in segment B, and 
make the segments exogamous and intermarrying. Thus it 
was impossible for any person to marry another of the same 
totem. This is the theory of Mr Frazer. 

Upholders of the contradictory system maintain that the 
Arunta nation has passed through and out p£ the universal and 
normal system of hereditary and exogamous totemism into its 
present condition, by reason of the belief that children are 
incarnations of pre-existing animal or vegetable spirits, plus the 
unique Arunta idea of the connexion of such spirits with their 
stone churinga. Where this combination of the two beliefs does 
not occur, there the Arunta non-hereditary and non-exogamous 
totemism does not occur. It would necessarily arise in any 
normal tribe which adopted the two Arunta beliefs, which are not 
" primitive." 

Arguments againsl Mr Frazer 7 s Theory. — There was obviously 
a time, it is urged, when all totems were, as everywhere else, 

heavens " among the Arunta. Mr Strehlow's being, Altjira, has 
a name apparently meaning " mystic " or sacred, which is applied 
to other things, for example to the inherited maternal totem of 
each native. His names for Altjira (god) and for the totemic 
ancestors (totem gods), are inappropriate, but may be discounted. 
Many other tribes who are discussed by Mr Frazer have been long 
under missionary influence as well as the Aranda. Accordingto 
Mr Frazer the Dieri tribe had enjoyed a German Lutheran mission 
station (since 1866) for forty-four years up to 1910. About 150 
Dieri were alive in 1909 (Totemism, iii. 344). Nevertheless the 
Dieri myths published by Mr Siebert in the decadence of the 
tribe, and when the remnant was under missionaries, show no 
" alien sediment." Nor do the traditions of Mr Strehlow's Aranda. 
Their traditions are closely akin, now to those of the Arunta, now 
to those of the northern tribes, now to those of the Euahlayi of Mrs 
Langloh Parker (The Euahlayi Tribe) in New South Wales, and once 
more to those of Mr Howitt's south-eastern tribes. There is no trace 
of Christian influence in the Aranda and Loritja matter, no vestige 
of " alien " (that is, of European) " sediment," but the account of 
Atnatu among the Kaitish reported on by Messrs Spencer and Gillen 
reads like a savage version of Milton's " Fall of the Angels " in Paradise 
Lost. For these reasons we do not reject the information of Mr 
Strehlow, who is master of several tribal languages, and, of course, 
does not encourage wicked native rites by providing supplies of 
flour, tobacco, &c, during the performances, as Mr Howitt and 
others say that they found it necessary to do. Sceptical colonists 
have been heard to aver that natives will go on performing rites as 
long as white men will provide supplies.

TOTEMISM 



in what the Arunta call "the right" divisions; Arunta, that is, 
were so arrayed that no totem existed in more than one division. 
Obliged, as now, to marry out of their own exogamous division 
(one of four sub-classes among the Arunta) into one of the four 
sub-classes of the opposite side, no man could then find in it a 
woman of his own totem to marry. But when Arunta ceased to 
be hereditary, and came to be acquired, as now, by the local 
accident of the totem spirits — all, in each case, of one totem 
name, which haunt the supposed place of a child's conception — 
some totems inevitably would often get out of their original 
sub-class into another, and thus the same totems are in 
several divisions. But granting that a man of division 
A may legally marry a woman of division B, he is not 
now prevented from doing so because his totem (say Wild 
Cat) is also hers. His ,or hers has strayed, by accident 
of supposed place of conception, out of its " right " 
into its " wrong " division. The words " right " and " wrong " 
as here used by the Arunta make it certain that they still 
perceive the distinction, and that, before the Arunta evolved 
the spiritual view of conception, they had, like other people, 
their totems in each case confined to a single main exogamous 
division of their tribe, and therefore no persons could then 
marry into their own totems. 

But when the theory of spiritual conception arose, and was 
combined, in the Arunta set of tribes alone (it is common enough 
elsewhere in northern and western Australia), with the churinga 
doctrine, which gave totems by accident, these two factors, as 
Messrs Spencer and Gillen say, became the causes — " lie at the 
root " — of the present Arunta system by which persons may marry 
others of " the right " division, but of " the wrong " totem. 
That system is strictly confined to the group of tribes (Ilpirra, 
Loritja, Unmaterja, Kaitish, Arunta) which constitute " the 
Arunta nation." Elsewhere the belief in spiritual conception 
widely prevails, but not the belief in the connexion of spirits of 
individuals with the stone churinga of individuals. Consequently 
the Arunta system of marriage within the totem exists nowhere, 
and the non-exogamous non-hereditary totem exists nowhere, 
except in the Arunta region. Everywhere else hereditary totems 
are exogamous. 1 

Thus the practice of acquiring the totem by local accident 
is absolutely confined to five tribes where the churinga doctrine 
coexists with it. That the churinga belief, coexistent with the 
spiritual theory of conception, is of relatively recent origin is a 
demonstrable fact. Had it always been present among the 
Arunta the inevitable result, in the course of ages, would be the 
scattering of the totems almost equally, as chance would scatter 
them among the eight exogamous divisions. 

This can be tested by experiment. Take eight men, to 
represent the eight exogamous divisions, and set them apart in 
two groups of four. Take four packs of cards, 208 cards, to 
represent the Arunta totems, which are over 200 in number. 
Deal the cards round in the usual way to each of the eight men; 
each will receive 26 cards. It will not be found that group A has 
" the great majority " of spades and clubs, while group B has 
" the great majority " of diamonds and hearts, and neither group 
will have " the great majority " of court cards. Accident does 
not work in that way. But while accident alone now determines 
the totem to which an Arunta shall belong, nevertheless " in the 
Arunta, as a general rule, the great majority of the members of 
any one totemic group belong to one moiety of the tribe; but this 
is by no means universal . . . " — that is, of the totems the great 
majority in each case, as a rule, belongs to one or the other set of 
four exogamous sub-classes. 2 

The inference is obvious. While chance has now placed only 
the small minority of each totem in all or several of the eight 
exogamous divisions, the great majority of totems is in one or 
another of the divisions. This great majority cannot come by 
chance, as Arunta totems now come; consequently it is but lately 
that chance has determined the totem of each individual. Had 
chance from the first been the determining cause, each totem 

1 N.T.CA.p. 257; cf. Frazer, Totemism, i. 200-201. 
* Northern tribes, pp. 151 sqq. 



would not be fairly equally present in each of the two sets of four 
exogamous divisions. But determination by accident has only 
existed long enough to affect " as a general rule " a small minority 
of cases. " The great majority " of totems remain in what is 
recognized as " the right," the original divisions, as elsewhere 
universally. Arunta myth sometimes supports, sometimes 
contradicts, the belief that the totems were originally limited, 
in each case, to one or other division only, and, being self- 
contradictory, has no historic value. 

A further proof of our point is that the northern neighbours 
of the Arunta, the Kaitish, have only partially accepted Arunta 
ideas, religious and social. Unlike the Arunta they have a 
creative being, Atnatu, from whom half of the population 
descend; the other half were evolved out of totemic forms. 3 In 
the same way the Kaitish totems " are more strictly divided 
between the two moieties " (main exogamous divisions) " of the 
tribe." 4 Consequently a man may marry a woman of his own 
totem if she be in the right exogamous division. " She is not 
actually forbidden to him, as a wife becomes of this identity and 
totem, as she would be in the Warramunga neighbouring 
tribe . . ." " It is a very rare thing for a man to marry a 
woman of the same totem as himself," 6 naturally, for the old 
rule holds, in sentiment, and a totem is still very rarely in the 
wrong division. The Arunta system of accidental determination 
of the totem has as yet scarcely produced among the Kaitish 
any of its natural and important effects. 

This view of the case seems logical: Arunta non-exogamous 
non-hereditary totemism is the result, as Messrs Spencer and 
Gillen show, of the theory of spiritual conception and the theory 
of the relation of the spirit part of each individual to his churinga. 
These two beliefs have already caused a minority of Arunta 
totems to get out of the original and into the wrong exogamous 
Arunta divisions. The process is not of old standing; if it were, 
all totems would now be fairly distributed among the divisions 
by the laws of chance. In the Kaitish tribe, on the other hand, 
the processes must be of very recent operation, for they have only 
begun to produce their necessary effects. The totemism of the 
Arunta is thus the reverse of " primitive," and has but slightly 
affected the Kaitish. 

Precisely the opposite view of the facts is taken by Mr Frazer 
in his erudite and exhaustive work Totemism, In the Kaitish, 
he writes, " we may detect the first stage in the transition from 
promiscuous marriage and fortuitous descent of the totem to 
strict exogamy of the totem clans and strict heredity of the 
totems in the paternal line." 6 By "promiscuous marriage," 
marriage within or without the totem, at pleasure, is obviously 
intended, for the Arunta do not marry " promiscuously " — do 
not marry their nearest kin. 

How, on Mr Frazer's theory, was the transition from the 
condition of the Arunta to that of the Kaitish made? If the 
Kaitish were once in the actual Arunta stage of totemism, how 
did their totems come now to be much more strictly divided 
between the two moieties, though " the division is not so 
absolute as amongst the Urabunna in the south and the tribes 
farther north . . ."? How did this occur? The Kaitish have 
not made totems hereditary by law; they are acquired by local 
accident. They have not made a rule that all totems should, 
as among the more northern neighbours of the Arunta, he 
regimented so that no totem occurs in more than one division: 
to this rule there are exceptions. A man " is not actually 
forbidden " to marry a woman of his own totem provided she 
be of " the right division," but it is clear that he " does not 
usually do so." This we can explain as the result of a survival 
in manners of the old absolute universal prohibition. 

Meanwhile our view of the facts makes all the phenomena 
seem natural and intelligible in accordance with the statement 
of the observers, Messrs Spencer and Gillen, that the cause of 
the unique non-hereditary non-exogamous totems of the Arunta 
is the combination of the churinga spiritual belief with the belief 
in spiritual conception. This cause, though now present among

the Kaitish, has, so far, operated but faintly. We have been 
explicit on these points because on them the whole problem of 
the original form of totemism hinges. In our view, for the reasons 
stated, the Arunta system of non-exogamous non-hereditary 
totemism is a peculiarity of comparatively recent institution. 
But Mr Frazer, and the chief observer of the phenomena, Mr 
Spencer, consider the Arunta system, non-exogamous and non- 
hereditary, to be the most archaic form of totemism extant. 

As to non-hereditary, we find another report of the facts in 
Die Aranda und Loritja Stamme, by the Rev. Mr Strehlow, who 
has a colloquial and philological knowledge of the language of 
these tribes. As he reports, among other things, that the 
Aranda (Arunta) in his district inherit their mother's totems, in 
addition to their " local totems," they appear to retain an 
archaic feature from which their local totem system and marriage 
rules are a departure. 1 

The hereditary maternal totem is, in Mr Strehlow's region, the 
protective being (altjira) of each Arunta individual. 

Are the Arunta " Primitive " or not? — In the whole totemic 
controversy the question as to whether the non-exogamous 
non-hereditary totemism of the Arunta or the hereditary and 
exogamous totemism of the rest of Australia and of totemic 
mankind, be the earlier, is crucial. 

That Arunta totemism is a freak or " sport," it is argued, 
is made probable first by the fact that the Arunta inherit all 
things hereditable in the male line, whereas inheritance in the 
female descent is earlier. (To this question we return; see below, 
Male and Female Lines of Descent.) M. Van Gennep argues 
that tribes in contact, one set having female, the other male, 
descent, " like the Arunta have combined the systems." 2 But 
several northern tribes with male descent of the totem which are 
not in contact with tribes of female descent show much stronger 
traces of the " combination " than the Arunta, who intermarry 
freely with a tribe of female descent, the Urabunna; while the 
Urabunna, though intermarrying with the Arunta who inherit 
property and tribal office in the male line, show no traces of 
" combination." Thus the effects occur where the alleged 
causes are not present; and the alleged causes, in the case of 
the Urabunna and Arunta, do not produce the effects. 

Next the Arunta have no names for their main exogamous 
divisions, these names being a very archaic feature which in many 
tribes with sub-classes tend to disappear. In absence of phratry 
names the Arunta are remote from the primitive. M. Van 
Gennep replies that perhaps the Arunta have not yet made the 
names, or have not yet borrowed them. This is also the view 
of Mr Frazer. As he says, the Southern Arunta lived under the 
rule of eight classes, but of these four were anonymous, till the 
names for them were borrowed from the north. The people 
can thus have anonymous exogamous divisions; the two main 
divisions, or phratries, of the Arunta may, therefore, from the 
first, have been anonymous. 

To this the reply is that people borrow, if they can, what they 
need. The Arunta found names fdr their four hitherto anony- 
mous classes to be convenient, so they borrowed them. But 
when once class-names did, as they do, all that is necessary, the 
Arunta had no longer any use for the names of the two primary 
main divisions: these were forgotten; there is nothing to be got 
by borrowing that; while four Arunta " sub-classes " are gaining 
their names, the " classes " (phratries or main divisions) have 
lost them. It is perfectly logical to hold that while things 
useful, but hitherto anonymous, are gaining names, other things, 
now totally useless, are losing their names. One process is as 
natural as the other. In all Australia tribes with two main 
divisions and no sub-classes, the names of the two main divisions 
are found, because the names are useful. In several tribes with 
named sub-classes, which now do the work previously thrown on 
the main divisions, the names of the main divisions are unknown: 
the main divisions being now useless, and superseded by the sub- 
classes. The absence of names of the two main divisions in the 
Arunta is merely a result, often found, of the rise of the sub- 

1 Strehlow, ii. 57 (1908). 

2 Mythes et legendes d Austratie, p. xxxii. 



classes, which, as Mr Frazer declares, are not primitive, but the 
result of successive later legislative acts of division. 8 

Manifestly on this point the Arunta are at the farthest point 
from the earliest organization: their loss of phratry names is 
the consequence of this great advance from the " primitive." 

All Arunta society rests on a theory of reincarnated spirits, 
a theory minutely elaborated. M Van Gennep asks " why 
should this belief not be primitive? " Surely neither the 
belief in spirits, nor the elaborate working out of the belief 
connecting spirits with manufactured stone amulets, can have 
been primitive. Nobody will say that peculiar stone amulets 
and the Arunta belief about spirits associated with them are 
primitive. To this M Van Gennep makes no reply. 4 

The Arunta belief that children are spirit-children (ratapa) 
incarnated is very common in the other central and northern 
tribes, and, according to Mrs Bates, in Western Australia; Dr 
Roth reports the same for parts of Queensland. It is alleged by 
Messrs Spencer and Gillen that the tribes holding this belief 
deny any connexion between sexual unions and procreation* 
Mr Strehlow, on the other hand, says that in his region the 
older Arunta men understand the part of the male in procreation; 
and that even the children of the Loritja and Arunta understand, 
in the case of animals. 5 (Here corroboration is desirable and 
European influence may be asserted.) Dr Roth says that the 
Tully River blacks of Queensland admit procreation for all 
other animals, which have no Koi or soul, but not for men, who 
have souls. (Their theory of human birth, therefore, merely 
aims primarily at accounting for the spiritual part of man.) 6 

According to Mrs Bates, some tribes in the north of South 
Australia, tribes with the same " class " names as the Arunta> 
hold that to have children a man must possess two spirits 
(ranee). If he has but one, he remains childless. If he has two> 
he can dream of an animal, or other object, which then passes 
into his wife, and is born as a child, the animal thus becoming the 
child's totem. This belief does not appear to apply to reproduc- 
tion in the lower animals. It is a spiritual theory of the begetting 
of a soul incarnated. If a man has but one spirit, he cannot give 
one to a child, therefore he is childless. 

It is clear that this, and all other systems in which reproduction 
is explained in spiritual terms, can only arise among peoples 
whose whole mode of thinking is intensely •" animistic." It is 
also plain that all such myths answer two questions — (i)'How 
does a being of flesh and spirit acquire its spiritual part? — (2) 
How is it that every human being is in mystical rapport 
with an animal, plant, or other object, the totem? Manifestly 
the second question could not arise and need answer before 
mankind were actually totemists. It may be added that in 
the south of Western Australia the name for the mythical 
" Father of All " (a being not there worshipped, though 
images of him are made and receive some cult at certain 
licentious festivals) and the name for " father-stock " is 
maman, which Mrs Bates finds to be the native term for 
membrum virile. All this appears to be proof of understand- 
ing of the male part in reproduction, though that understanding 
is now obscured by speculation about spirits. 

The question arises then, is the ignorance of procreation, where 
that ignorance exists, " primitive," and is the Arunta totemism 
also " primitive," being conditioned, as we are told it is, by the 
unique belief in some churinga? Or is the ignorance due to 
attempts of native thinkers to account for the spirit in man as a 
pre-existing entity that has been from the beginning? The 
former view is that of Messrs Spencer and Gillen, and Mr Frazer. 
For the latter see Lang, Anthropological Essays presented to 
E. B. Tylor, pp. 210-218, We can hardly call people primitive 
because they have struggled with the problem " how has material 
man an indwelling spirit? "

TOTEMISM 



Primitive Marriage (1866), theories of the origin of exogamy 
have been rife and multifarious. All, without exception, are 
purely conjectural. One set of disputants hold that man 
(whatever his original condition may have been) was, when he 
first passed an Act of Exogamy, a member of a tribe. Howitt's 
term for this tribe was " the undivided commune." It had, 
according to him, its inspired medicine-man, believed to be in 
communication with some superior being. It had its pro- 
bouleutic council of elders or " headmen " and its general 
assembly. Such was man's political condition. 1 It is not dis- 
tinguishable from that of many modern Australian tribes. Other 
tribes, said by some to be the most primitive, the Arunta and 
their neighbours, pay no attention to the dictates of a superior 
being, and tbe Arunta of Spencer and Gillen seem to know no 
such entity, though as Atnatu, Tukura, Altjira, and " the Great 
Ulthaana of the heavens," he exists in a dwindled form among 
the Kaitish, Loritja and outlying portions of the Arunta tribe. 
In religion Howitt's early men were already in advance of Mr 
Spencer's Arunta. Socially, man, at this date, according to 
Howitt, at first left the relations of the sexes wholly unregulated; 
the nearest kinsfolk by blood coupled at will, though perfectly 
aware that they were, at least on the maternal side, actual 
brothers and sisters, parents and children. 

Upholders of the first theory, that man lived promiscuously 
in a tribal state with legislative assemblies and then suddenly 
reformed promiscuity away, must necessarily differ in their 
opinion as to the origins of totems and exogamy from the friends 
of the second theory, who beb'eve that man never was "pro- 
miscuous," and given to sexual union with near kin. Why man, 
on the first theory — familiar as he was with unions of the nearest 
kin — suddenly abolished them is explained in four or five different 
ways. Perhaps the most notable view is Mr Frazer's; he easily 
confutes, in thirty-five pages, the other hypotheses. 2 Man- saw, 
or thought he saw, injurious consequences to the wedded near- 
related couples, and therefore he prohibited, first, unions between 
mothers and sons, and brothers and sisters. 3 But, in his fourth 
volume, Mr Frazer sees conclusive objections to this view 4 and 
prefers another. Some peoples, far above the estate of savagery, 
believe that human incest blights and sterilizes the crops, 
women and animals. " If any such belief were entertained by 
the founders of exogamy, they would clearly have been perfectly 
sufficient motives for instituting the system, for they would 
perfectly explain the horror with which incest has been regarded 
and the extreme severity with which it has been punished." 6 
That is to say, people had a horror and hatred of incest because 
they supposed that it blighted the crops and other things. Mr 
Frazer had previously written (iv. 108) " It is important to bear 
steadily in mind that the dislike of certain marriages must always 
have existed in the minds of the people, or at least of their leaders, 
before that dislike, so to say, received legal sanction by being 
embodied in an exogamous rule." 

Again (iv. 112) " There had, for some reason unknown to us, 
been long growing up a strong aversion to consanguineous 
unions " — before any legislative bar was raised against them. 
This is insisted on. The prohibition " must have answered to 
certain general sentiments of what was right and proper " 
(iv. 121). But here the theorist has to explain the origin of 
the strong aversion, the general sentiment that unions of near 
kin are wrong and improper. But Mr Frazer does not seem to 
explain the point that most needs explanation. That " strong 
aversion," that " general sentiment," cannot have arisen from 
a growing belief that unions of close kin spoiled the crops or 
the natural resources of the country. That superstition could 
only arise as a consequence of the horror and aversion with 
which " incest " was regarded. Now no idea corresponding 
to " incest " could arise before unions of near kin were deemed 
abominable. When once such unions were thought hateful to 
gods and men, and an upsetting of the cosmic balance, then, 
but not till then, they might be regarded as injurious to the 
crops. All such beliefs are sanctions of ideas already in strong 

* N.T.S.E.A. pp. 89, 90. * Ibid. i. 165. 

1 Totemism, iv. 75-120. 4 Ibid. iv. 155, 156. 

6 Ibid. iv. 158. 



force. The idea that such or such a thing is wrong begets 
the prohibition, followed by the sanction — tbe belief that 
the practice of the thing is injurious in a supernormal way: 
where that belief exists. We do not know it in Australia, for 
example. 

A belief that close sexual unions were maleficent cosmic 
influences could not possibly arise previous to, and could not 
then cause, "the dislike of certain marriages"; "the strong 
aversion to consanguineous unions " — which existed already. 
This latest guess of Mr Frazer at the origin of the idea of 
" incest "7- of the abomination of certain unions — is untenable. 
What he has to explain is the origin of the dislike, the aversion, 
the horror. Once that has arisen, as he himself observes, the 
prohibition follows, and then comes the supernormal sanction. 
Thus no theory of exogamous rules as the result of legislation 
to prevent the unions of persons closely akin, can' produce, or 
has produced, any reason for the aversion to such unions arising 
among people to whom, on the -theory, they were familiar. 
Mr Frazer has confuted the guesses of MacLennan, Morgan, 
Durkheim and others; but his own idea is untenable. 

The Supposed Method of Reform. — On Mr Frazer's theory 
the reformers first placed half of the mothers of the tribe, 
with their children, in division A; and the rest of the mothers, 
with their children, in division B. The members of each division 
(phratry) must marry out of it into the other, and thus no man 
could marry his sister or mother. (The father could marry his 
daughter, but in tribes with no exogamous explicit rule against 
the union, he never does.) Later the two divisions were bisected 
each into a couple of pairs (classes) preventing marriage 
between father and daughter; and another resegmentation 
prohibited the unions of more distant relations. These systems, 
from the simplest division into two phratries, to the more 
complex with two " sub-classes " in each phratry, and the 
most elaborate of all with four sub-classes in each phratry, 
exist in various tribes. Environment and climate have 
nothing to do with the matter. The Urabunna and the 
Arunta live in the same climate and environment, and inter- 
marry. The Urabunna have the most primitive, the Arunta 
have the most advanced of these organizations. While the 
rules are intended to prevent consanguineous marriages, the 
names of the " sub-classes " (when translatable, the names of 
animals) cannot perhaps be explained. They have a totemic 
appearance. 

Totems in Relation to Exogamy. — So far, in this theory nothing 
has been said of totems, though it is an all but universal rule 
that people of tjie same totem may not intermarry, even if the 
lovers belong to tribes separated by the breadth of the continent. 
In fact, according to the hypothesis which has been set forth, 
totems, though now exogamous, played no original part in 
the evolution of exogamy. They came in by accident, not by 
design, and dropped into their place in a system carefully 
devised. 

Originally, on this theory, a totem came to a child, not as is 
usual now, by inheritance, but by pure accident; the mother 
supposing that any object which caught her attention at the 
moment when she first felt the life of her child, or any article 
of food which she had recently eaten, became incarnate in her, 
so that the emu (say) which she saw, or had eaten of, was her 
child. He or she was an Emu man or woman, by totem was an 
Emu. 

Certain localities, later, were somehow associated each with 
one given object — cat, kangaroo, grub, or anything else, and 
now " local totems " (if the phrase may be used) took the place 
of " conceptional totems," as among the Arunta. The child 
inevitably was of the local totem and its supposed place of 
conception. 

Finally all tribes except the Arunta " nation " made^ the totem 
hereditary, either from mother or father; and as the mother or 
father, an Emu, was in division A, so was the child, and he 
or she must marry out of that division into the other, B.* 

The objections taken to this theory are now to be stated: 

• Frazer, Totemism, i. 157-167. 



TOTEMISM 



85 



(i.) The theory can by no possibility apply to tribes with three 
or more main exogamous divisions or phratries, such as we find 
in North America. In a three-phratry tribe we are reduced to 
suppose that there were three sexes, or resor*- to some other 
solution not perhaps compatible with the theory, (ii.) We have 
no evidence that any totemic people, except the Navajoes, 
think the closest sexual unions injurious to the parties or their 
offspring. The theory is thus merely extracted from the facts — 
certain unions "are forbidden, therefore they must have been 
deemed injurious. Now, even if they were generally thought 
injurious, the belief would be a mere inference from the fact 
that they were forbidden, (iii.) The supposed original legisla- 
tive exogamous division produced a very different effect than 
that said to be aimed at, namely, the prohibition of marriage 
between brothers and sisters. It forbade to every man marriage 
with half the women of his tribe, most of whom were not, even 
in the wide native use of the term, his " tribal " sisters, that 
is, women in a man's phratry of the same status as his own 
sisters. Such relationships, of course, could not exist before 
they were created by the supposed Act of Division. It would 
have been easy to prohibit marriages of brothers with sisters 
directly, just as, though no exogamous rule forbids, the father, 
in tribes of female descent, is directly forbidden to marry his 
daughters. *The natives can take a simple instead of a bewilder- 
ing path. To this natural objection Mr Frazer replies: 1 " If we 
assume, as we have every right to do, that the founders of exo- 
gamy in Australia recognized the classificatory system of rela- 
tionship, and the classificatory system of relationship only, we 
shall at once perceive that what they intended to prevent was 
not merely the marriage of a man with his sister, his mother, 
or his daughter in the physical sense in which we use these 
terms; their aim was to prevent his marriage with his sister, 
his mother and his daughter in the classificatory sense of 
these terms; that is, they intended to place bars to marriage 
not between individuals merely but between the whole groups 
of persons who designated their group, not their individual 
relationships, their social, not their consanguineous ties, by the 
names of father and mother, brother and sister, son and daughter. 
And in this intention the founders of exogamy succeeded per- 
fectly." Mr Frazer's theory of the origin of exogamy appears 
now to waver. It was 2 that the primal bisection of the 
tribe was " deliberately devised and adopted as a means of 
preventing the marriage, at first, of brother with sisters. . . ." 
Here was the place to say, if it was then intended to say, that 
the Australians " recognized the classificatory system of rela- 
tionships only." As a matter of fact they recognize both the 
consanguine and the classificatory systems. It is not the 
case that " the savage Australian, it may be said with truth, 
has no idea of relationships as we understand them, and does 
not discriminate between his actual father and mother and 
the men and women who belong to the group, each member of 
which might have lawfully been either his father or his mother, 
as the case may be." 

This statement is made inadvertently and unfortunately by 
Messrs Spencer and Gillen, 5 but it is contradicted by their 
own observations. An Arunta can tell you, if asked, which of 
all the men whom he calls " father " is his very own father. 4 
The Dieri have terms for " great " (actual) and " little " (tribal) 
father, and so for other relationships. In Arunta orgies 
a woman's " tribal " " fathers " and " brothers " and " sons " 
are admitted to her embraces; her actual father and brothers 
and sons are excluded. 6 Thus, if the prohibition be based on 
aversion to unions of persons closely akin by blood, as the 
actual father is excluded, the actual father, among the Arunta, 
is, or has been, amongst that people, regarded as near of blood to 
his daughters. The Arunta are ignorant, we are told, of the 
part of the male in procreation. Be it so, but there has been 
a time when they were not ignorant, and when the father was * 
recognized as of the nearest kin by blood to his daughters. If

not, and if the prohibition is based on hatred of unions of 
close kin, why is the father excluded? Nothing, in short, can 
be more certain than that Australian tribes distinguish between 
" social " or " tribal " relations on the one hand, and close 
consanguine relations on the other. Among the Arunta office 
is inherited by a man from his mother's husband, his father quern 
nuptiae demonstrant; not from any " tribal " father. 6 

Mr Frazer 7 apparently meant in his earlier statement that 
brothers and sisters consanguine, and these only, were to 
be excluded from intermarriage, because he went on to say that 
science cannot decide as to whether the closest interbreeding 
is injurious to the offspring of healthy parents, however near 
in blood; and that very low savages could not discover what is 
hidden from modern science. He had therefore marriages of 
consanguine brothers and sisters present to his mind: " the 
closest interbreeding." Brothers and sisters were finally for- 
bidden, on this theory, to intermarry, not because of any dread 
of injury to the offspring. " The only alternative open to us 
seems to be to infer that these unions were forbidden because 
they were believed to be injurious to the persons engaged in 
them, even when they were both in perfect health." 8 These 
" incestuous unions " are between brothers and sisters, mothers 
and sons. Here brothers and sisters consanguine, children of the 
same mother in each case, certainly appear to be intended. Who 
else, indeed, can be intended? But presently* we are to assume 
that the Australians, before they made the first exogamous 
division of the tribe " recognized the classificatory system of 
relationship, and the classificatory system only." They meant, 
now, to bar marriage between " whole groups of persons," 
related by " social, not consanguineous ties." But this seems 
to be physically impossible. These " whole groups " never 
existed, and never could exist, as far as we can see, till they 
were called into being by the legislative division of the tribe 
into two exogamous phratries — which had not yet been made. 
How could a man call a whole group of women " nupa," as at 
present (the word being applied to his wife and to all women 
of the opposite phratry to his whom he might legally marry) 
before the new law had constituted such a group? In what 
sense, again, were all women of a certain status called my 
" sisters " (like my actual sisters) before the new law made a 
new group of them — in regard to marriage as sacred as my own 
sisters now were to me? It cannot be said that all women 
of my status were called, collectively, my " sisters " before the 
new division of the tribe and new rule arose, because previously, 
all women of my status in the tribe have been my " sisters." 
Who else could be collectively my " sisters "? If to marry a 
" sister " were reckoned dangerous to her and to me, I must have 
been forbidden to marry all the women of my status in the 
tribe. How could a law which merely halved the number of my 
" sisters " remove the unknown danger from half of them? If 
any women except my actual sisters were, before the new rule, 
reckoned as socially my sisters, all women in the tribe of a certain 
status must have been so reckoned. If all dangerous, I must 
marry none of them. But by the new rule, I may marry half 
of them! Why have they ceased to be dangerous? 

If the theory be that originally only brothers and sisters con- 
sanguine were thought dangerous to each other in sexual rela- 
tions, and the superstition was later extended so as to include 
all " classificatory " brothers and sisters, who were in these 
days (before the exogamous division) classificatory brothers and 
sisters? How and for what reason were some marriageable 
girls in the tribe classificatory sisters of a young man while 
others, equally young and marriageable, were not ? The classi- 
ficatory brothers and sisters must have been all the marriageable 
youth of both sexes in a generation, in the tribe. 

But then if all the youth of a generation, of both sexes, 
were classificatory brothers and sisters, and if therefore their 
unions were dangerous to themselves, or to the crops, the danger 
could not be prevented by dividing them into two sets, and

TOTEMISM 



allowing each set of brothers to marry each set of sisters. The 
only way to parry the danger was to force all these brothers and 
sisters to marry out of the local tribe into another local tribe 
with the same superstition. When that was done, the two local 
tribes, exogamous and intermarrying, were constituted into the 
two phratries of one local tribe. But that is not the theory of 
observers on the spot: their hypothesis is that a promiscuous 
and communistic local tribe, for no known or conceivable 
reason, bisected itself into two exogamous and intermarrying 
" moieties." 

On the face of it, it is a fatal objection to the theory that when 
men dwelt in an undivided commune they recognized no system 
of relationships but the classificatory, yet were well aware of 
consanguineous relationships; were determined to prohibit 
the marriages of people in such relationships; and included in 
the new prohibition people in no way consanguineous, but 
merely of classificatory kin. The reformers, by the theory, 
were perfectly able to distinguish consanguineous kinsfolk, so 
that they might easily have forbidden them to intermarry; 
while if all the members of the tribe were not in the classificatory 
degrees of relationship, who were? How were persons in classifi- 
catory relationships with each other discriminated from other 
members of the tribe who were not? They were easily discrim- 
inated as soon as the phratries were instituted, but, we think, not 
before. 

Term of Classificatory Relationships. — Here it is necessary to 
say a few words about " classificatory " terms of relationship. 
Among many peoples the terms or names which with us denote 
relationships of consanguinity or affinity, such as Father, 
Mother, Brother, Sister, Son, Daughter, Husband, Wife, are 
applied both to the individuals actually consanguineous in 
these degrees, and also to all the other persons in the speaker's 
own main exogamous division or phratry who are of the same 
" age-grade " and social status as the Father, Mother, Brother, 
Sister, Son, Daughter, Husband, Wife, and so forth. As a 
man thus calls all the women whom he might legally have married 
by the same term as he calls his wife, and calls all children of 
persons of his own " age-grade," class and status by the same 
name as he calls his own children, many theorists hold this to 
be a proof of the origin of the nomenclature " in a system of 
group marriage in which groups of men exercised marital rights 
over groups of women, and the limitation of one wife to one 
husband was unknown. Such a system would explain very 
simply why every man gives the name of wife to a whole group 
of women, and every woman gives the name of husband to a 
whole group of men," and so on with all such collective terms 
of relationship. 1 

Certainly this is a very simple explanation. But if we wished 
to explain why every Frenchman applies the name which he 
gives to his " wife " (femme) to every " woman " in the world, 
it would be rather simpler than satisfactory to say that this 
nomenclature arose when the French people lived in absolute 
sexual promiscuity. The same reasoning applies to English 
" wife," German Weib, meaning " woman," and so on in many 
languages. Moreover the explanation, though certainly very 
simple, is not " the only reasonable and probable explanation." 
Suppose that early man, as in a hypothesis of Darwin's, lived, 
not in large local tribes with the present polity of such tribes 
in Australia, but in " cyclopean families," where the sire con- 
trolled his female mates and offspring; and suppose that he, 
from motives of sexual jealousy, and love of a quiet life, forbade 
amours between his sons and daughters. Suppose such a society 
to reach the dimensions of a tribe. The rules that applied to 
brothers and sisters, mothers and sons, would persist, and the 
original names for persons in such relationships in the family 
would be extended, in the tribe, to all persons of the same 
status: new terms being adopted, or old terms extended, to 
cover new social relationships created by social laws in a wider 
society. 

Another Theory of the Origin of Toiemism and Exogamy. — How 
this would happen may be seen in studying the other hypothesis 
1 Totemism, i. 304. 



of exogamy and totemism. 2 Man was at first, as Darwin sup- 
posed, a jealous brute who expelled his sons from the neighbour- 
hood of his women; he thus secured the internal peace of his 
fire circle; there were no domestic love-feuds. The sons there- 
fore of necessity married out — were exogamous. As man 
became more human, a son was permitted to abide among his 
kin, but he had to capture a mate from another herd (exogamy). 

The groups received sobriquets from each other, as Emu, 
Frog, and so forth, a fact illustrated copiously in the practice 
of modern and English and ancient Hebrew villages. 3 

The rule was now that marriage must be outside of the local 
group-name. Frog may not marry Frog, or Emu, Emu. The 
usual savage superstition which places all folk in mystic 
rapport with the object from which their names are derived 
gradually gave a degree of sanctity to Emu, Frog and the rest. 
They became totems. 

Perhaps the captured women in" group Emu retained and 
bequeathed to their children their own group-names; the 
children were Grubs, Ants, Snakes, &c. in Emu group. Let 
two such groups, Emu and Kangaroo, tired of fighting for 
women, make peace with connubium, then we have two phra- 
tries, exogamous and intermarrying, Emu and Kangaroo, with 
totem kins within them. (Another hypothesis is necessary 
if the original rule of all was, as among the Urabuima and other 
tribes, that each totem kin must marry out of itself into only one 
other totem kin. 4 But we are not sure of the fact of one 
totem to one totem marriage.) In short, the existence of the 
two main exogamous divisions in a tribe is the result of an alliance 
of two groups, already exogamous and intermarrying, not of a 
deliberate dissection of a promiscuous horde. 5 

The first objection to this system is that it is not held by 
observers on the spot, such as Mr Howett and Mr Spencer. 
But while all the observed facts of these observers are accepted 
(when they do not contradict their own statements, or are not 
corrected by fresh observations), theorists are not bound to 
accept the hypotheses of the observers. Every possible respect 
is paid to facts of observation. Hypotheses as to a stage of 
society which no man living has observed may be accepted as 
freely from Darwin as from Howitt, Spencer and L. Morgan. 

It is next objected that " the only ground for denying that the 
elaborate marriage-system " (systems?) " of the Australian 
aborigines has been devised by them for the purpose which 
it actually serves, appears to be a preconceived idea that these 
savages are incapable of thinking out and putting in practice 
a scries of checks on marriage so intricate that many civilized 
persons lack either the patience or the ability to understand 
them . . . The truth is that all attempts to trace the origin and 
growth of human institutions without the intervention of human 
intelligence and will are radically vicious and foredoomed to 
failure.", 6 But nobody is denying that the whole set of 
Australian systems of marriage is the result of human emotions, 
intelligence and will. Nobody is denying that, in course of 
time, the aborigines have thought out and by successive steps 
have elaborated their systems. The only questions are, what 
were the human motives and needs which, in the first instance, 
set human intelligence and will to work in these directions; and 
how, in the first instance, did they work? The answers given 
to these questions are purely and inevitably hypothetical, 
whether given by observers or by cloistered students. 

It is objected, as to the origin of totemism, that too much 
influence is given to accident, too little to design. The answer 
is that " accident " plays a great part in all evolution, and that,

Daniel McLennan, occurred independently to M. Van Gennep, who, 
in Myihes et legendes d'Australie, suppressed his chapter on it, after 
reading The Secret of the Totem. The conclusions were almost 
identical with those of that^ work (Op. cit. pp. vi. xxxiv.). The

TOTEMISM 



87 



in the opposed theory, the existence and actual exogamous 
function of totems is also accidental, arising from ignorance 
and a peculiar superstition. It is urged that no men would 
accept a nickname given from without by hostile groups. This 
is answered by many examples of cases in which tribes, clans, 
political parties, and, of course, individuals, have accepted 
sobriquets from without, and even when these were hostile and 
derisive. 1 It is asked, Why, on this theory, are there but two 
exogamous divisions in the tribe? The reply is that in America 
there may be three or more: that in the Urabunna there are as 
many exogamous divisions (dual) as there are totems, and that 
these, like the main exogamous divisions, go in pairs, because 
marriage is between two contracting parties. 2 

It is maintained in this theory that Australian blacks, who are 
reflective and by no means illogical men, have long ago observed 
that certain marriages are rigorously barred by their social 
system, for no obvious reason. Thus a man learns that he 
must not marry in his own main exogamous division, say 
Eagle Hawk. He must choose a wife from the opposite division, 
Crow. She must belong to a certain set of women in Crow, 
whose tribal status is precisely that, in Crow, of his own sisters, 
and his " little sisters " (the women of his sister's status) in 
Eagle Hawk. The reflective tribesman does not know why these 
rules exist. But he perceives that the marriageable women in 
his own main division bear the same title as his sisters by 
blood. He therefore comes to the conclusion that they are 
all what his own sisters manifestly are, " too near flesh," as the 
natives say in English; and that the purpose of the rule is to 
bar marriage to him with all the women who bear the name 
" sisters " that denotes close consanguinity. Presently he 
thinks that other kinsfolk, actual, or bearing the same collective 
title as actual kinsfolk of his, are also " too near flesh," and he 
goes on to bar them till he reaches the eight class model; or 
like some south-eastern tribes, drops the whole cumbrous 
scheme in favour of one much like our own. 

The reflective savage, in short, acts exactly as the Church 
did when she extended to cousins the pre-existing Greek and 
Roman prohibitions against the marriages of very near kin; 
and, again, extended them still further, to exclude persons not 
consanguineous at all but called by the same title as real 
consanguines, " father," " mother " and " child " in " gossipred " 
— godfather, godmother, godchild. 

The savage and ecclesiastical processes are parallel and 
illustrate each other. Probably when a tribe with two main 
exogamous and intermarrying divisions came into existence in 
the way which we have indicated, the names used in families for 
father, mother, daughter, son, husband, wife, brother, sister, 
were simply extended so as to include, in each case, all persons in 
the tribe who were now of the same status, socially, with the 
same rights, restrictions and duties, as had been theirs in the 
fire-circle before the tribe was made a tribe by the union of two 
exogamous and previously hostile intermarrying local groups; 
or two sets of such groups. The process is natural; the wide 
extension now given to old names of relationships saved the 
trouble of making new names. Thus we have found a reasonable 
and probable way of accounting for classificatory terminology 
without adopting the hypothesis that it arose out of " group- 
marriage " and asking " But how did group-marriage arise?" 

There is no accident here, all is deliberate and reflective 
design, beginning with the purely selfish and peace-loving 
design of the jealous sire. Meanwhile the totemic prohibition, 
" no marriage in the same totem name," has been retained and 
expanded even beyond the tribe, and " however remote the 
hunting grounds " of two persons, they may not intermarry if 
their totem name be the same. 

Such are the two chief opposed theories of the origins of 
exogamy, and of the connexions of exogamy with totemism. 
The second does not enjoy the benefit of notice and criticism 
in Mr Frazer's Totemism.

Relations of the Social and Religious Aspects of Totemism, — It 
is a curious fact (if it be accepted as a fact) that the social 
aspect of totemism — the prohibition to marry a person of the 
same hereditary totem name — is sometimes strongest where 
the " religious " prohibition against killing or eating the totem 
is weakest; while the highest regard is paid to the totem, or 
to the god which is supposed to inhabit the totem species, where 
there is no prohibition on marrying within the totem name. 
Thus in Australia, where (except in the centre, among the 
Arunta) almost all tribes prohibit marriages within the totem 
name, it is scarcely possible to find an instance in which irreligious 
treatment of the totem, killing or eating it, is (as among many 
other totemic peoples) thought to be automatically or " reli- 
giously " punished by illness, death or miscarriage. Religion, 
in these cases, does not hold that the injured majesty of the 
totem avenges itself on the malefactor. On the other hand the 
Samoans, who pay no regard to the sacred animal of each 
community in the matter of not marrying within his name, 
believe that he will inflict death if one of his species be eaten — 
and if no expiatory rite be performed. 3 In Samoa, we saw, 
the so-called totem is the vehicle of a God; in Australia no such 
idea is found. 

Meanwhile the offence of marrying within the totem name is 
nowhere automatically punished in any way except among the 
American Navajos, where, to make certain, the totem kin also 
inflicts secular penalties; 4 and it is part of the magic of the 
Intichiuma rites for the behoof of the totem that his kin should 
eat of him sparingly, as on all occasions they may do. In all 
other quarters, where marriage within the totem kin is forbidden, 
the penalty of a breach of law has been death or tribal excom- 
munication. The offence is secular. The Euahlayi, who never 
marry within the totem name, " may and do eat their hereditary 
totems with no ill effects to themselves." 5 This is very 
common in South Australia. As a rule, however, in Australia 
some respect is paid to the actual plant or animal, and some 
Northern tribes who inherit the paternal totem respect it almost 
as much as the maternal totem. As they also inherit property 
in the maternal line, it seems clear that they have passed from 
female to male descent, as regards the totem, but not as regards 
inheritance. 6 

Male and Female Descent of the Totem. — It was the almost 
universal opinion of anthropologists that, in the earliest totemic 
societies, the totem was inherited from the mother, and that 
inheritance from the father was a later development. But when 
the peculiar totemism of the Arunta was discovered, and it was 
desired to prove that this non-exogamous totemism was the 
most primitive extant, it was felt to be a difficulty that the Arunta 
reckon descent of everything hereditable in the male, not the 
female line. If then, the Arunta were not primitive but advanced, 
in this matter as well as in their eight sub-classes and ceremonies, 
how could their totemism be primitive? It would have been 
easy to reply that a people might be " primitive " in some details 
though advanced in others — the fact is notorious. But to escape 
from the dilemma the idea was proposed that neither male nor 
female descent was more primitive than the other. One tribe 
might begin with male, one with female descent. Nobody can 
prove that it was not so, but " whereas evidence of the passage 
from female to male reckoning may be observed, there is virtually 
none of a change in the opposite direction." 7 

Thus the Worgaia and Northern neighbours of the Arunta, 
with male descent, have certainly passed through a system of 
female descent of the totem, and actually inherit property in the 
female line, while Strehlow's Aranda or Arunta inherit their 
mothers' totems. Moreover Howitt shows us at least one tribe

Tribes, p. 166. That these tribes, though reckoning descent in

TOTEMISM 



with female descent, the Dieri, actually in the process of diverging 
from female to maje descent of the totem. " A step further is 
when a man gives his totem name to his son, who' then has those 
of both father and mother. This has been done even in the 
Dieri tribe," which appears to mean that it is also done in other 
tribes. 1 

A difficult case in marriage law is explained by saying that 
" possibly some man, as is sometimes the case, gave his Murdu 
(totem) to his son, who was then of two Murdus, and so could not 
marry a girl of one of his two totems." 2 We thus see how the 
change from female to male descent of the totem is " directly 
led to," as Mr Howitt says, 8 by a man's mere fatherly desire to 
have his son made a member of his own totem kin. On the other 
hand, we never read that with male descent of the totem a mother 
gives hers to son or daughter. All these facts make it hard to 
doubt (though absolute proof is necessarily impossible) that 
female everywhere preceded male descent of the totem. 

Proof of transition from female to male descent of the totem 
appears to be positive in some tribes of the south of South 
Australia. Among them each person inherits his mother's 
totem, and may not marry a woman of the same. But he also 
inherits his father's totem, which " takes precedence," and gives 
its name to the local group. No person, as apparently among 
the Dieri when a father has " given his totem " to a son, may 
marry into either his father's or his mother's totem kin (Mrs 
Bates). 

Thus we have a consecutive series of evolutions: (a) All 
inherit the maternal totem only, and must not marry within it. 
This is the rule in tribes of south-east Australia with female 
descent, (b) Some fathers in this society give their totems to 
sons, who already inherit their maternal totems. Such sons can 
marry into neither the paternal nor maternal totems. This was 
a nascent rule among the Dieri. (c) All inherit both the paternal 
and the maternal totem, and may marry into neither (southern 
South Australia), (d) All inherit the religious regard for the 
maternal totem, but may marry within it, while they may not 
marry within the paternal totem (Worgaia and Warramunga of 
north central Australia), (e) The paternal totem alone is 
religiously regarded, and alone is exogamous (tribes of south- 
east Australia with male descent). (/) The totem is neither 
hereditary on either side nor exogamous (Spencer's Arunta). 
(g) The maternal totem is hereditary and sacred, but not 
exogamous (Strehlow's Arunta). 

In this scheme we give the degrees by which inheritance of the 
totem from the mother shades into inheritance of the totem from 
both parents (Dieri), thence to inheritance of both the maternal 
and paternal totem while the paternal alone regulates marriage 
(Worgaia and Warramunga), thence to exclusive inheritance of 
the paternal, without any regard paid to the maternal totem 
(some tribes of South Australia), and so on. 

Meanwhile we hear of no tribe with paternal descent of the 
totem in which mothers are giving their own totems also to their 
children. We cannot expect to find more powerful presumptions 
in favour of the opinion that tribes having originally only 
maternal have advanced by degrees to only paternal descent of 
the totem. Mr Frazer says, " So far as I am aware, there is no 
evidence that any Australian tribe has exchanged maternal for 
paternal descent, and until such evidence is forthcoming we are 
justified in assuming that those tribes which now trace descent 
from the father formerly traced it from the mother." 4 

We have now provided, however, the evidence for various 
transitional stages from maternal to paternal descent, but have 
found no traces of the contrary process, nor more than one way of 
interpreting the facts. It is admitted by Mr Frazer that in several 
North American tribes the change from female to male descent 
has to all appearance been made. 6 Among the Delawares the 
initial process was much akin to that of the Dieri, who, in a tribe 
of female descent, " gives " his own totem to his sons. " The 
Delawares had a practice of sometimes naming a child into its 
father's clan," and a son thus became a member of his father's

clan. This " may very well have served to initiate a change of 
descent from the female to the male fine." Howitt says pre- 
cisely the same thing about the paternal practice of the Dieri. 
Thus there is no reason for denying that the change from female 
to male descent can be made by Australian as readily as by 
American tribes. We have given evidence for every step in the 
transition. The opposite opinion arose merely in an attempt 
to save the primitiveness of the Arunta, some of whom actually 
still make the maternal totem hereditary. 

The change to male descent is socially very important. The 
totem kin of a man, for example, takes up his blood feud. Where 
the descent is female a " man may probably have some (totemic) 
kinsmen in the same group, but equally a considerable number 
of members of other totem kins." But it is clear that the rule 
of male descent gives far greater security to the members of a 
local group; for they are surrounded by kinsmen, local totem 
groups only occurring where male descent of the totem prevails, 
or is predominant. 7 The change from female to male descent of 
the totem, or the adoption of male descent from the first (if it 
ever occurred) is thus a great social advantage. 

The Ways out of Totemism. — While Howitt believed (though 
later he wavered in his opinion) that female had always preceded 
male descent of the totem, he also observed that with male 
descent came in abnormal developments. One of these is that 
the people of a district with male descent are often known by 
the name of the region, or of some noted object therein (say wild 
cherries). 8 They may even regard (or white observers suppose 
that they regard) some object as their " local totem," yet they 
marry within that so-called totem. But they take to marrying, 
not out of the hereditary totem kin, which becomes obsolescent, 
but out of their own region into some other given locality. Thus 
in the Kurnai tribe there were no inevitable hereditary totems, 
but thundung were given by the fathers to lads" when about ten 
years old or at initiation." 9 The animal thundung(e\der brother) 
was to protect the boy, or girl (the girl's thundung was 'called 
banung). The names of the creatures, in each case, appear to 
have been given to their human brothers and sisters; the 
thundung name descended to a man's sons. " The names 
are perpetuated " (under male descent) " from- generation to 
generation in the same locality." 10 

• Thus it appears that when a Kurnai wishes to marry he 
goes to a locality where he finds girls of banung names into 
which he may lawfully wed. So far he seems, in fact, to practise 
totemic exogamy; that he has to travel to a particular locality 
is merely an accident. Though the thundung and banung 
names are not inherited at birth by the children, they are given 
by the father when the child is old enough to need them. 11 

On the whole, we seem to see, in tribes where male descent 
is of old standing, that the exogamous function of the totem 
becomes obsolete, but a shadow of him, as thundung, retains a 
sort of " religious " aspect and even an unappreciated influence 
in marriage law. 

In Fiji and Samoa, in Melanesia 12 and British New Guinea, 
many types of contaminated and variegated survivals of totem- 
ism may be studied. In the Torres Islands 13 hero-worship blends 
with totemic survivals. As in parts of South Africa, where a 
tribe, not a kin, has a sacred animal, as in Fiji, he seems to be the 
one survivor of many totems, the totem of some dominant local 

6 Totemism, iii. 42. 

7 Except among the Arunta, where, though totems come by 
change, local groups are usual. See Spencer and Gillen, Central 
Tribes, p. 9. How this occurs we can only guess. See Folk Lore, 
vol. xx., No. 2, pp. 229-231. Here it is conjectured that adults 
of the totem congregate for the purpose of convenience in performing 
Intichiuma, or magical services for the propagation of the totem 
as an article of food. For the nature of these rites, common in 
the central and northern but unknown to the south-eastern tribes, 
see Centrat Tribes, pp. 167-212, and Northern Tribes K pp. 283-320.

totem group, before which the other totems have fled, or but 
dimly appear, or are vehicles of gods, or, in Africa, of ancestral 
spirits. (These African tribal sacred animals are called Siboko 1 .) 
Some tribes explain that the Siboko originated in an animal 
sobrique, as ape, crocodile, given from without. 2 Sibokoism, the 
presence of a sacred animal in a local tribe, can hardly be called 
totemism, though it is probable that the totem of the leading 
totem kin, among several such totem kins in a tribe, has become 
dominant, while the others have become obsolete. On the Gold 
Coast of Africa as long ago as 1819, Bowdich 8 found twelve 
" families," as he called them, of which most were called by the 
name of an animal, plant or other object, more or less sacred 
to them. They might not marry a person of the same kindred 
name, and there can be little doubt that totemism, with exogamy, 
had been the rule. But now the rules are broken down, especially 
in the peoples of the coast. The survivals and other informa- 
tion may be found in the Journal oj 'the Anthropological Institute 
(1906) xxxvi. 178, 188. 

There are fainter traces of totemism in the Awemba between 
Lake Tanganyika and Lake Bangweolo. 4 A somewhat vague 
account of Bantu totems in British East Africa, by Mr C. W. 
Hobley, indicates that among exogamous " clans " a certain 
animal is forbidden as food to each " clan." 5 The largest 
collection of facts about African totemism, from fresh and 
original sources, is to be found in Mr Frazer's book. For 
totemism in British Columbia the writings of Mr Hill Tout may 
be consulted. 6 The Thlinkit tribes have the institution in 
what appears to be its earliest known form, with two exogamous 
phratries and female descent. Among the Salish tribes " per- 
sonal " totems are much more prominent. Mr Hill Tout, with 
Professor F. Boas, considers the hereditary exogamous totem 
to have its origin in the non-exogamous personal totem, which is 
acquired in a variety of ways. The Salish are not exogamous, 
and have considerable property and marked distinctions of rank. 
It does not, therefore, appear probable that their system of 
badges or crests and personal totems* is more primitive than the 
totemic rules of the less civilized Thlinkits, who follow the form 
of the south-east Australian tribes. 7 

Other very curious examples of what we take to be aberrant 
and decadant totemism in New Guinea are given by Mr Selig- 
mann (Man, 1908, No. 89), and by Dr Rivers for Fiji (Man, 
1908, No. 75). Mr Seligmann (Man, 1908, No. 100) added to 
the information and elucidated his previous statements. The 
" clans " in British south-east New Guinea usually bear geo- 
graphical names, but some are named after one of the totems 
in the " clan." " Every individual in the clan has the same 
linked totems," of which a bird, in each case, and a fish seem 
to be predominant and may not be eaten. " The clans are 
exogamous . . . and descent is in the female line." It appears, 
then, that a man, having several totems, all the totems in his 
" clan," must marry a woman of another " clan " who has all 
the totems of her " clan." 

Similar multiplicity of totems, each individual having a 
number of totems, is described in Western Australia (Mrs 
Bates). In this case the word " totem " seems to be used rather 
vaguely and the facts require elucidation and verification. 
In this part of Australia, as in Fiji 8 "pour la naissance . . . 
l'apparition du totem-animal avait toujours lieu." In Fiji 
the mother sees the animal, which does not affect conception, 
and " is merely an omen for the child already conceived." But 
in Western Australia, as we have seen, the husband dreams 
of an animal, which is supposed to follow him home, and to be 
the next child borne by his wife If it is correctly stated that 
when the husband has dreamed of no animal, while nevertheless 
his wife has a baby, the husband spears the man whom he 
suspects of having dreamed of an animal, the marital jealousy

takes an unusual form and human life becomes precarious. But 
probably the husband has some reason for the direction of his 
suspicions. He never suspects a woman. 

" The Banks' Islanders," says Mr Frazer, " have retained the 
primitive system of conceptional totemism." ft On the other hand 
Dr Rivers, who is here our authority, writes " totemism is absent " 
from " the northern New Hebrides, the Banks' and the Terres 
groups." 10 In a place where totemism is absent it does not prima 
facie seem likely that we shall discover " the primitive system 
of conceptional totemism." The Banks' Islanders have no 
totemism at all. But they have a certain superstition applying 
to certain cases, and that superstition resembles Arunta and 
Loritja beliefs, in which Mr Frazer finds the germs of totemism. 
The superstition, however, has not produced any kind of 
totemism in the Banks' group of isles, at least, no totemism is 
found. " There are," writes Dr Rivers, " beliefs which would seem 
to furnish the most natural starting-point for totemism, beliefs 
which Dr Frazer has been led by the Australian evidence " 
(by part of the Australian evidence, we must say) " to regard 
as the origin of the institution." Thus, in Banks' Islands we 
have the starting-point of the institution, without the institution 
itself, and in many Australian tribes we have the institution — 
without the facts which are " the most natural starting-point." 
As far as they go these circumstances look as if " the most 
natural " were not the actual starting-point. The facts are 
these: in the Isle of Mota, Banks' group, " many individuals " 
are under a tabu not to eat, in each case, a certain animal 
or fruit, or to touch certain trees, because, in each case, " the 
person is believed to be the animal or fruit in question." 

This tabu does not, as in totemism, apply to every individual; 
but only to those whose mothers, before the birth of the indivi- 
duals, " find an animal or fruit in their loin-cloths." This, 
at least, " is usually " the case. No other cases are given. 
The women, in each case, are informed that their child " will 
have the qualities of the animal " (or fruit) " or even, it appeared 
would be himself or herself the animal " (or fruit). A coco-nut 
or a crocodile, a flying fox or a brush turkey, could not get 
inside a loin-cloth; the animal and fruits must be of exiguous 
dimensions. When the animal (or fruit) disappears " it is 
believed that it is because the animal has at the time of its dis- 
appearance entered into the woman. It seemed quite clear that 
there was no belief in physical impregnation on the part 
of the animal nor of the entry of a material object in the form 
of the animal . . , but, so far as I could gather, an animal 
found in this way was regarded as more or less supernatural, a 
spirit animal and not one material, from the beginning." 

" There was no ignorance of the physical r61e of the human 
father, and the father played the same part in conception as 
in cases unaccompanied by an animal appearance." The part 
played by the animal or fruit is limited to producing a tabu 
against the child eating it, in each case, and some community 
of nature with the animal or fruit. Nothing here is hereditary. 
The superstition resembles some of those of the Arunta, Loritja 
and Euahlayi. Among the Euahlayi the superstition has no 
influence; normal totemism prevails; among the Arunta nation 
it is considered to be, and Dr Rivers seems to think that it is, 
likely to have been the origin of totemism. In Mota, however, 
it either did not produce totemism, or it did; and, where the 
germ has survived in certain cases, the institution has disappeared 
— while the germinal facts have vanished in the great majority 
of totemic societies. Dr Rivers does not explain how a brush 
turkey, a sea snake or a flying fox can get into a woman's 
loin-cloth, yet these animals, also crabs, are among those tabued 
in this way. Perhaps they have struck the woman's fancy 
without getting into her loin-cloth. 

It is scarcely correct to say that " the Banks' Islanders 
have retained the primitive system of conceptional totemism." 
They only present, in certain instances, features like those which 
are supposed to be the germs of a system of conceptional

totemism. In the case of the Arunta we have demonstrated 
that hereditary and exogamous totemism of the normal type 
preceded the actual conceptional method of acquiring, by local 
accident, "personal totems." If the Banks' Islanders were 
ever totemists they have ceased to be so, and merely retain, in 
cases, a superstition analogous to that which, among the Arunta, 
with the aid of the stone churinga, has produced the present 
unique and abnormal state of affairs totemic. 

For totemism in India, see Dalton, Descriptive Ethnology of Bengal; 
for the north of Asia, Strahlenberg's Description, &c. (1738); and in 
all instances Mr Frazer's book. 

Myths of Totem Origins, — The myths of savages about the 
origin of totemism are of no historical value. Not worshipping 
ancestral spirits, an Australian will not, like an ancestor- 
worshipping African, explain his totem as an ancestral spirit. 
But where, as in the north and centre, he has an elaborate 
philosophy of spirits, there the primal totems exude spirits 
which are incarnated in women. 

In their myths as to the origin of totemism, savages vary 
as much as the civilized makers of modern hypotheses. Some 
claim descent from the totem object; others believe that an 
original race of animals peopled the world; animals human in 
character, but bestial, vegetable, astral or what not, in form. 
These became men, while retaining the rapport with their 
original species; or their spirits are continually reincarnated in 
women and are born again (Arunta of Messrs Spencer and 
Gillen); or spirits emanating from the primal forms, or from 
objects in nature, as trees or rocks, connected with them, enter 
women and are reincarnated (Arunta of Mr Strehlow and some 
Australian north-western tribes, studied by Mrs Bates). 
Other Australians believe that the All-Father, Baiame, gave 
totems and totemic laws to men. 1 There are many other explana- 
tory myths wherever totemism, or vestiges thereof, is found in 
Australia, Africa, America and Asia. 

All the myths of savages, except mere romantic Miirchen, and 
most of the myths of peoples who, like the Greeks, later became 
civilized, are " actiological," that is, are fanciful hypotheses 
made to account for everything, from the universe, the skies, 
the sun, the moon, the stars, fire, rites and ceremonies, to the 
habits and markings of animals. It is granted that almost all of 
these fables are historically valueless, but an exception has been 
made, by scholars who believe that society was deliberately 
reformed by an act bisecting a tribe into two exogamous divisions, 
for savage myths which hit on the same explanation. We might 
as well accept the savage myths which hit on other explanations, 
for example the theory that Sibokoism arose from animal 
sobriquets. Exceptions are also made for Arunta myths in 
which the primal ancestors are said to feed habitually if not 
exclusively on their own totems. But as many totems, fruit, 
flowers, grubs, and so on are only procurable for no longer than 
the season of the May-fly or the March-brown, these myths are 
manifestly fabulous. 

Again the Arunta primal ancestors are said to have cohabited 
habitually with women of their own totem, though without 
prejudice against women of other totems whom they encountered 
in their wanderings. These myths are determined by the 
belief in oknanikilla, or spots haunted by spirits all of one totem, 
which, again, determine the totem of every Arunta. The 
idea being that the fabled primal ancestors male and female 
in each wandering group of miracle-workers were always all of 
one totem, it follows that, if not celibate, which these savages 
never are, they must have cohabited with women of their own 
totem, and, by the existing Arunta system, there is no reason 
why they should not have done so. In no other field of research 
is historical value attributed to savage legends about the 
inscrutable past that lies behind existing institutions. 

We are thus confronted by an institution of great importance 
socially where it regulates marriages and the blood-feud, 
or where it is a bond of social union between kinsmen in the 
totem or members of a society which does magic for the behoof

of its totem (central and north-western Australia), and is of 
some " religious " and mythical importance when, as in Samoa, 
the sacred animal is regarded as the vehicle of a god. Of the 
origin of these beliefs, which have practical effects in the evolution 
of society and religion, much, we saw, is conjectured, but as we 
know no race in the act of becoming totemic— as in all peoples 
which we can study totemism is an old institution, and in most 
is manifestly decaying or being transmuted— we can only form 
the guesses of which examples have been given. Others may 
be found in the works of Herbert Spencer and Lord Avebury, 
and criticisms of all of them may be read in A. Lang's Social 
Origins. 

Whether or not survivals of totems are to be found in the 
animal worship of ancient Egypt, in the animal attendants of 
Greek gods, in Greek post-Homeric legends of descent from gods 
in various bestial disguises, and in certain ancient Irish legends, it 
is impossible to be certain, especially as so many gods are now 
explained as spirits of vegetation, to which folk-lore assigns 
carnal forms of birds and beasts. 

Other Things called Totems.— As has been said, the name 
" totem " is applied by scholars to many things in nature which 
are not hereditary and exogamous totems. The " local totem " 
(so called) has been mentioned, also " linked totems." 

Personal^ Totems. — This is the phrase for any animal or other 
object which has been " given " to a person as a protective 
familiar, whether by a sorcerer 2 or by a father, or by a congress 
of spaewives at birth; or whether the person selects it for him- 
self, by the monition of a dream or by caprice. The Euahlayi 
call the personal totem Yunbeai, the true totem they style Dhe. 
They may eat their real but not their personal totems, which 
answer to the hares and black cats of our witches. 

Three or four other examples of tribes in which " personal 
totems " are " given " to lads at initiation are recorded by 
Howitt. 3 The custom appears to be less common in Australia 
than in America and Africa (except in South Australia, where 
people may have a number of "personal totems "). In one case 
the "personal totem " came, to a man in a dream, as in North 
America. 4 Here it may be noted that the simplest and appar- 
ently the easiest theory of the origin of totemism is merely 
to suppose that a man, or with female descent a woman, 
made his or her personal totem hereditary for ever in his or her 
descendants. But nobody has explained how it happened 
that while all had evanescent personal totems those of a few 
individuals only become stereotyped and hereditary for ever. 

Sex-Totems. — The so-called "sex totem" is only reported in 
Australia. Each sex is supposed by some tribes to have its 
patron animal, usually a bird, and to injure the creature is to 
injure the sex. When lovers are backward the women occasion- 
ally kill the animal patron of the men, which produces horse- 
play, and " a sort of jolly fight," like sky-larking and flirtation. 6 
The old English " jolly kind of fight," between girls as partisans 
of ivy, and men as of the holly " sex-totem," is a near analogue. 
It need not be added that " sex-totems " are exogamous, in 
the nature of things. 

Sub-Totems. — This is the name of what are also styled " multi- 
plex totems," that is, numerous objects claimed for their own 
by totem kins in various Australian regions. The Emu totem 
kin, among the Euahlayi tribe, claims as its own twenty-three 
animals and the north-west wind. 6 The whole universe, 
including mankind, was apparently .divided between the totem 
kins. Therefore the list of sub-totems might be extended 
indefinitely. 7 These " sub-totems " are a savage effort at 
universal classification. 

Conclusion. — We have now covered the whole field of con- 
troversy as to the causes and origins of totemic institutions. 
Australia, with North America, provides the examples of those 
institutions which seem to be " nearest to the beginning," 
and in Australia the phenomena have been most carefully and

-elaborately observed among peoples the least sophisticated. In v 
North America most that we know of many great tribes, 
Iroquois, Hurons, Delawares and others, was collected long ago, 
^nd when precision was less esteemed, while the tribes have 
been much contaminated by our civilization. It has been 
unavoidably necessary to criticize, at almost every stage, the 
conclusions and hypotheses of the one monumental collection 
of facts and theories, Mr Frazer's Totemism (1910). Persons 
who would pursue the subject further may consult the books 
mentioned in the text, and they will find a copious, perhaps an 
exhaustive bibliography in the references of Mr Frazer's most 
erudite volumes, with their minute descriptive account not 
only of the totemism, but of the environment and general 
-culture of hundreds of human races, in Savagery and in the 
Lower and Higher Barbarism. (A. L.) 

TOTILA (d. 552), king of the Ostrogoths, was chosen king 
after the death of his uncle Ildibad in 541, his real name being, 
as is seen from the coinage issued by him, Baduila. The work 
of his life was the restoration of the Gothic kingdom in Italy and 
he entered upon the task at the very beginning of his reign, 
collecting together and inspiring the Goths and winning a victory 
over the troops of the emperor Justinian, near Faenza. Having 
gained another victory in 542, this time in the valley of Mugello, 
he left Tuscany for Naples, captured that city and then received 
the submission of the provinces of Lucania, Apulia and Calabria. 
Totila's conquest of Italy was marked not only by celerity but also 
by mercy, and Gibbon says " none were deceived, either friends 
or enemies, who depended on his faith or his clemency." Towards 
the end of 545 the Gothic king took up his station at Tivoli and 
prepared to starve Rome into surrender, making at the same 
time elaborate preparations for checking the progress of Beli- 
sarius who was advancing to its relief. The Imperial fleet, moving 
up the Tiber and led by the great general, only just failed to 
succour the city, which must then, perforce, open its gates to 
the Goths. It was plundered, although Totila did not carry 
out his threat to make it a pasture for cattle, and when the 
Gothic army withdrew into Apulia it was from a scene of desola- 
tion. But its walls and other fortifications were soon restored, 
and Totila again marching against it was defeated by Belisarius, 
who, however, did not follow up his advantage. Several 
cities were taken by the Goths, while Belisarius remained 
inactive and then left Italy, and in 549 Totila advanced a third 
time against Rome, which he captured through the treachery 
of some of its defenders. His next exploit was the conquest 
and plunder of Sicily, after which he subdued Corsica and Sar- 
dinia and sent a Gothic fleet against the coasts of Greece. By 
this time the emperor Justinian was taking energetic measures 
to check the Goths. The conduct of a new campaign was 
entrusted to the eunuch Narses; Totila marched against him 
and was defeated and killed at the battle of Tagina in July 
552.

TOTNES, GEORGE CAREW, or Carey, Earl of (1555^629), 
English politician and writer, son of Dr George Carew, dean of 
Windsor, a member of a well-known Devonshire family, and Anne, 
daughter of Sir Nicholas Harvey, was born on the 29th of May 
1555, 1 and was educated at Broadgates Hall, Oxford, where he 
took the degree of M.A. in 1588. He distinguished himself 
on the field on several occasions and filled important military 
commands in Ireland. In 1584 he was appointed gentleman- 
pensioner to Queen Elizabeth, whose favour he gained. In 1586 
he was knighted -in Ireland. Refusing the embassy to France, 
Sir George Carew was made master of the ordnance in Ireland 
in 1588, in 1590 Irish privy councillor; and in 1592 lieutenant- 
general of the ordnance in England, in which capacity he 
accompanied Essex in the expedition to Cadiz in 1596 and to

introduction, however, to the Calendar of Carew MSS. the date of 
his birth is given as 1558, and his admission into Broadgates Hall in

as 1557. 



the Azores in 1597. In 1598 he attended Sir Robert Cecil, the 
ambassador, to France. He was appointed treasurer at war to 
Essex in Ireland in March 1599, and on the latter's sudden 
departure in September of the same year, leaving the island 
in disorder, Carew was appointed a lord justice, and in 1600 
president of Munster, where his vigorous measures enabled the 
new lord deputy, Lord Mountjoy, to suppress the rebellion. He 
returned to England in 1603 and was well received by James I., 
who appointed him vice-chamberlain to the queen the same 
year, master of the ordnance in 1608, and privy councillor in 
1616; and on the accession of Charles I. he became treasurer 
to Queen Henrietta Maria in 1626. He sat for Hastings in the 
parliament of 1604, and on the 4th of June 1605 was created 
Baron Carew of Clopton, being advanced to the earldom of 
Totnes on the 5th of February 1626. In 1610 he revisited 
Ireland to report on the state of the country; and in 1 618 pleaded 
in vain for his friend Sir Walter Raleigh. He died on the 27th 
of March 1629, leaving no issue. He married Joyce, daughter of 
William Clopton, of Clopton in Warwickshire. 

Besides his fame as president of Munster, where his administration 
forms an important chapter in Irish history, Carew had a consider- 
able reputation as an antiquary. He was the friend of Camden, of 
Cotton and of Bodley. He made large collections of materials 
relating to Irish history and pedigrees, which he left to his secretary, 
Sir Thomas Stafford, reputed on scanty evidence to be his natural 
son; while some portion has disappeared, 39 volumes after coming 
into Laud's possession are now at Lambeth, and 4 volumes in the 
Bodleian Library. A calendar of the former is included in the 
State Papers series edited by J. S. Brewer and W. Bullen. His 
correspondence from Munster with Sir Robert Cecil was edited in 
186^ by Sir John Maclean, for the Camden Society, and his letters 
to Sir Thomas Roe (1615-1617) in i860. Other letters or papers are 
in the Record Office; among the MSS. at the British Museum and 
calendared in the Hist. MSS. Com. Series, Marquess of Salisbury's 
MSS. Stafford published after Carew's death Pacata Hibernia, or 
the History of the Late Wars in Ireland (1633), the authorship of 
which he ascribes in his preface to Carew t> but which has been 
attributed to Stafford himself. This was reprinted in 1810 and re- 
edited in 1896. A Fragment of the History of Ireland, a translation 
from a French version of an Irish original, and King Richard II..., 
in Ireland from the French, both by Carew, are printed in Walter 
Harris's Hibernica (1757). According to Wood, Carew contributed 
to the history of the reign of Henry V. in Speed's Chronicle. His 
opinion on the alarm of the Spanish invasion in 1596 has also been 
printed.

TOTNES, a market town and municipal borough in the Totnes 
parliamentary division of Devonshire, England, on the Dart, 
29 m. S.S.W. of Exeter, by the Great Western railway. Pop. 
(1901), 4035. It stands on the west bank of the river, and is 
joined by a bridge to the suburb of Bridgetown. It was formerly 
a walled town, and two of the four gates remain. Many old 
houses are also preserved, and in High Street their overhanging 
upper stories, supported on pillars, form a covered way for 
foot-passengers. The castle, .founded [by the Breton Juhel, 
lord of the manor after the Conquest, was already dismantled 
under Henry VIII.; but its ivy-clad keep and upper walls 
remain. The grounds form a public garden. Close by are the 
remains of St Mary's Priory, which comprise a large Perpen- 
dicular gatehouse, refectory, precinct wall, abbot's gate and 
still-house. A grammar school, founded 1554, occupied part 
of the Priory, but was removed in 1874 to new buildings. The 
Perpendicular church of St Mary contains a number of interest- 
ing tombs and effigies dating from the 15th century onwards, 
and much excellent carved work. The guildhall is formed from 
part of the Priory. Vessels of 200 tons can he at the wharves 
near the bridge. The industries include brewing, flour mill- 
ing, and the export of agricultural produce, chiefly corn and 
cider. Trout and salmon are plentiful in the river. The town is 
governed by a mayor, 4 aldermen and 12 councillors. Area 
1423 acres. 

Totnes ( Toteneis, Totton) was a place of considerable importance 
in Saxon times; it possessed a mint in the reign of ^Ethelred, 
and was governed by a portreeve. In the Domesday Survey 
it appears as a mesne borough under Juhel of Totnes, founder 
of the castle and priory; it had 95 burgesses within and 15 
without the borough, and rendered military service according

to the custom of Exeter. In 121 5 a charter from John instituted 
a gild merchant with freedom from toll throughout the land. A 
mayor is mentioned in the court roll of 1386-1387; and a charter 
from Henry VII. in 1505 ordered that the mayor should be 
elected on St Matthew's day, and should be clerk of the market. 
The present governing charter was granted by Elizabeth in 
1596, and instituted a governing body of a mayor, fourteen 
masters or councillors, and an indefinite number of burgesses, 
including a select body called " the Twenty-men." A fresh 
charter of incorporation from James II. in 1689 made no altera- 
tions of importance. The borough was represented in parlia- 
ment by one member in 1295, and by two members from 1298 
until disfranchised by the act of 1867. A market on Saturday 
existed at least as early as 1255, and in 1608 is described as well 
stocked with provisions. The charter of Elizabeth granted a 
three days' fair at the feast of SS Simon and Jude (Oct. 28), 
and in 1608 fairs were also held on May day and at the feast of 
St James (July 25). The market day has been transferred to 
Friday, but the May and October fairs are continued. The 
town was formerly noted for serges, and in 1641 the inhabitants 
represented their distress owing to the decline of the woollen 
trade. The industry is now extinct. During the Civil War 
General Goring quartered his troops at Totnes, and Fairfax 
also made it his temporary station.

TOTONICAPAM, or Totonicapan, the capital of the depart- 
ment of Totonicapam, Guatemala, on the same high plateau as 
Quezaltenango, the nearest railway station, from which it is 
12 m. E.N.E. Pop. (1905) about 28,000. Totonicapam is 
inhabited mainly by Quiche Indians, employed in the making 
of cloth, furniture, pottery and wooden musical instruments. 
There are hot mineral springs in the neighbourhood. In 1838 
Totonicapam was declared an independent republic, in which 
the adjoining departments of Solola and Quezaltenango were 
included. This state existed for two years, and was then again 
merged in the republic of Guatemala. Totonicapam suffered 
greatly in the earthquake of the 18th of April 1902. 

TOTTENHAM, an urban district in the Tottenham parlia- 
mentary division of Middlesex, England, forming a north 
suburb of London, 6\ m. north of London Bridge, adjoining 
Edmonton on the south. Top. (1901), 102,541. Its full 
name, not now in use, was Tottenham High Cross, from the 
cross near the centre of the township. The origin and 
significance of this cross are doubtful. The present structure 
was erected c. 1600, and ornamented with stucco in 1809. In 
the time of Isaak Walton there stood by it a shady 
arbour to which the angler was wont to resort. Formerly 
Tottenham was noted for its " greens," in the centre of one 
of which stood the famous old elm trees called the " Seven 
Sisters"; these were removed in 1840, but the name is pre- 
served in the Seven Sisters Road. Bruce castle, on the site 
of the old mansion of the Bruces, but built probably by Sir 
William Compton in the beginning of the 16th century, was 
occupied by a boarding-school founded by Mr (afterwards Sir) 
Rowland Hill in 1827 on the system instituted by him at Hazle- 
wood, Birmingham. It became public property in 1892. 
The church of All Hallows, Tottenham, was given by David, 
king of Scotland (c.1126), to the canons of the church of Holy 
Trinity, London. It retains Perpendicular portions, a south 
porch of brick of the 16th century and numerous ancient monu- 
ments and brasses. The grammar school was enlarged and 
endowed in 1686 by Sarah, dowager duchess of Somerset. The 
urban district formerly included Wood Green to the west, but 
this became a separate urban district in 1888 (pop. 34,233). 

In the reign of Edward the Confessor the manor of Tottenham 
was possessed by Earl Waltheof . It was inherited by his daughter 
Maud, who was married first to Simon de St Liz and after- 
wards to David, son of Malcolm III., king of Scotland, who was 
created by Henry I. earl of Huntingdon, and received possession 



of all the lands formerly held by Earl Waltheof. The manor 
thus descended to William the Lion, king of Scotland, and was 
granted by him in 1184 to his brother David, J earl of Angus 
and Galloway, the grant being confirmed in 1199 by King 
John of England, who created him earl of Huntingdon. He 
married Maud, heiress of Hugh, earl of Chester, and his son 
John inherited both earldoms. The son married Helen, daughter 
of Llewelyn, prince of Wales, by whom he was poisoned in 
I2 37> dying without issue. She retained possession till 1254, 
when the manor was divided between his coheirs Robert de 
Brus, John de Baliol and Henry de Hastings, each division 
forming a distinct manor bearing the name of its owner. In 
1429 they were reunited in the possession of John Gedeney, 
alderman of London. 

William Bedwell, the Arabic scholar, was vicar of Tottenham, and 
published in 1632 a Brief e Description of the Towne of Tottenham, in 
which he printed for the first time the burlesque poem, the Turna- 
ment of Tottenham. 

TOTTENVILLE, a former village of Richmond county, New 
York, U.S.A., and since 1898 a part of New York City. It is 
on the southern shore of Staten Island in New York Bay and on 
Staten Island Sound, about 20 m. S.W. of the south extremity 
of Manhattan Island, and is the terminus of the Staten Island 
Rapid Transit railway. Marine engines, terra-cotta and boats 
are manufactured here, and there are oyster fisheries. The 
" Billopp House " here (still standing) was the scene of the con- 
ference, on the nth of September 1776, between Lord Howe, 
representing Lord North, and Benjamin Franklin, John Adams 
and Edward Rutledge, representing the Continental Congress, 
with regard to Lord North's offer of conciliation. This house, 
originally called the " Manor of Bentley," was built by Captain 
Christopher Billopp (1638-1726), who sailed from England in an 
armed vessel, the " Bentley," in 1667, and, by circumnavigating 
Staten Island in 24 hours, made it, under the ruling of the 
duke of York, a part of New York. From the duke of York 
he received 1163 acres of land, including the present site of 
Tottenville. The village was long known as Bentley, but in 
1869 was incorporated (under a faulty charter, revised in 1894) 
as Tottenville, apparently in honour of Gilbert Totten, a soldier 
in the War of Independence. 

TOUCAN, the Brazilian name of a bird, 1 long since adopted 
into nearly all European languages, and apparently first given 
currency in England (though not then used as an English word) 
in 1668 2 by W. Charleton (Onomasticon, p. 115); but the bird, 
with its enormous beak and feather-like tongue, was described 
by Oviedo in his Sumario de la historia natural de las Indias, 
first published at Toledo in 1527 (ch. 42),* and, to quote 
the translation of part of the passage in F. Willughby's Ornith- 
ology (p. 1 29) , " there is no bird secures her young ones better from 
the Monkeys, which are very noisom to the young of most Birds. 
For when she perceives the approach of those Enemies, she so 
settles her self in her Nest as to put her Bill out at the hole, 
and gives the Monkeys such a welcome therewith, that they 
presently pack away, and glad they scape so." Indeed, so 
remarkable a bird must have attracted the notice of the earliest 
European invaders of America, the more so since its gaudy 
plumage was used by the natives in the decoration of their per- 
sons and weapons. In 1555 P. Belon (Hist. nat. oyseaux, p. 184) 
gave a characteristic figure of its beak, and in 1558 Thevet 
(Singularitez de la France antarctique, pp. 88-90) a long descrip- 
tion, together with a woodcut (in some respects inaccurate, 
but quite unmistakable) of the whole bird, under the name 
of "Toucan," which he was the first to publish. In 1560 
C. Gesner (Icones avium, p. 130) gave a far better figure (though

(Proc. Philolog. Society, May 15, 1885) adduces evidence to prove 
that the Guarani Tuca is from tl, nose, and cdng, bone, i.e. nose of 
bone. 

2 In 1656 the beak of an " Aracari of Brazil," which was a toucan 
of some sort, was contained in the Musaeum tradescantianum (p. 2), 
but the word toucan does not appear there.

still incorrect) from a drawing received from Ferrerius, and 
suggested that from the size of its beak the bird should be called 
Burhynchus or Ramphestes. This figure, with a copy of Thevet's 
and a detailed description, was repeated in the posthumous 
edition (1585) of his larger work (pp. 800, 801). By 1579 
Ambroise Pare (QZuvres, ed. Malgaigne, iii. 783) had dissected a 
toucan that belonged to Charles IX. of France, and about the 
same time Lery (Voyage fait en la terre du Brisil, ch. xi.), 
whose chief object seems to have been to confute Thevet, con- 
firmed that writer's account of this bird in most respects. In 
1599 Aldrovandus (Omithologia, i. 801-803), always ready to 
profit by Gesner's information, and generally without acknow- 
ledgment, again described and repeated the former figures of 
the bird; but he corrupted his predecessor's Ramphestes into 
Ramphastos, and in this incorrect form the name, which should 
certainly be Rhamphestes or Rhamphastas, was subsequently 
adopted by Linnaeus and has since been recognized by system- 
atists. Into the rest of the early history of the toucan's discovery 
it is needless to go. 1 Additional particulars were supplied by 
many succeeding writers, until in 1834 J. Gould completed his 
Monograph of the family 2 (with an anatomical appendix by 
R. Owen), to which, in 1835, he added some 'supplementary 
plates; and in 1854 he finished a second and much improved 
edition. The most complete compendium on toucans is J. 
Cassin's " Study of the Ramphastidae," in the Proceedings 
of the Philadelphia Academy for 1867 (pp. 100-124). 

By recent systematists 5 genera and from 50 to 60 species of the 
family are recognized; but the characters of the former have never 
been satisfactorily defined, much less those of numerous subdivisions 
which it has pleased some writers to invent. There can be little 
doubt that the bird first figured and described by the earliest 
authors above named is the R. toco of nearly all ornithologists, and 
as such is properly regarded as the type of the genus and^ therefore 
of the family. It is one of the largest, measuring 2 ft. in length, 
and has a wide range throughout Guiana and a great part of Brazil. 
The huge beak, looking like the great claw of a lobster, more than 
8 in. long and 3 high at the base, is of a deep orange colour, with a 
large black oval spot near the tip. The eye, with its double iris 
of green and yellow, has a broad blue orbit, and is surrounded by a 
bare space of deep orange skin. The plumage generally is black, 
but the throat is white, tinged with yellow and commonly edged 
beneath with red; the upper tail-coverts are white, and the lower 
scarlet. In other species of the genus, 14 to 17 in number, the bill 
is mostly particoloured — green, yellow, red, chestnut, blue and black 
variously combining so as often to form a ready diagnosis; but some 
of these tints are very fleeting and often leave little or no trace after 
death. Alternations of the brighter colours are also displayed in 
the feathers of the throat, breast and tail-coverts, so as to be in like 
manner characteristic of the species, and in several the bare space 
round the eye is yellow, green, blue or lilac. The sexes are alike in 
coloration, the males being largest. The tail is nearly square or 
moderately rounded. In the genus Pteroglossus, the " Aracaris " 
(pronounced Arassari), the sexes moreor less differ in appearance, 
and the tail is graduated. The species are smaller in size, and 
nearly all are banded on the belly, which is generally yellow, with 
black and scarlet, while except in two the throat of the t males at 
least is black. One of the most remarkable^ and beautiful is P. 
beauharnaisi, by some authors placed in a distinct genus and called 
Beauharnaisius ulocomus. In this the feathers of the top of the 
head are very singular, looking like glossy curled shavings of black 
horn or whalebone, the effect being due to the dilatation of the shaft 
and it? coalescence with the consolidated barbs. Some of the 
feathers of the straw-coloured throat and cheeks partake of the same 
structure, but in a less degree, while the subterminal part of the 
lamina is of a lustrous pearly-white.' The beak is richly coloured, 

1 One point of some interest may, however, be noticed. < In 1705 
Plot (N.H. Oxfordshire, p. 182) recorded a toucan found within two 
miles of Oxford in 1644, the body of which was given to the repository 
in the medical school of that university, where, he said, " it is still to 
be seen." Already in 1700 Leigh in his Lancashire (i. 195, Birds, 
tab. 1, fig. 2) had figured another which had been found dead on the 
coast of that county about two years before. The bird is easily kept 
in captivity, and no doubt from early times many were brought alive 
to Europe. Besides the one dissected by Pare", as above mentioned, 
Joh. Faber, in his additions to Hernandez's work on the Natural 
History of Mexico (1651), figures (p. 697) one seen and described by 
Puteus (Dal Pozzo) at Fontainebleau. 

2 Of this the brothers Sturm in 1841 published at Nuremberg a 
German version. 

3 This curious peculiarity naturally attracted the notice of the first 
discoverer of the species, Poeppig, who briefly described it in a letter 
published in Froriep's Notizen (xxxii. 146) for December 1831. 



being green and crimson above and lemon below. The upper 
plumage generally is dark green, but the mantle and rump are 
crimson, as are a broad abdominal belt, the flanks and many 
crescentic markings on the otherwise yellow lower parts. 4 The 
group or genus Selenodera, proposed by J. Gould in 1837 (Icones 
avium, pt. 1), contains some 6 or 7 species, having the beak, which 
is mostly transversely striped, and tail shorter than in Pteroglossus. 
Here the sexes also differ in coloration, the males having the head 
and breast black, and the females the same parts chestnut; but all 
have a yellow nuchal crescent (whence the name of the group). The 
so-called hill-toucans have been separated as another genus, Andi- 
gena, and consist of some 5 or 6 species chiefly frequenting the slopes 
of the Andes and reaching an elevation of 10,000 ft., though one, 
often placed among them, but perhaps belonging rather to Ptero- 
glossus, the A. bailtoni, remarkable for its yellow-orange head, neck 
and lower parts, inhabits the lowlands of southern Brazil. Another 
very singular form is >L laminirostris, which has affixed on either 
side of the maxilla, near the base, a quadrangular ivory-like plate, 
forming a feature unique in this or almost in any family of birds. 
The group Aulacorhamphus, or " groove-bills," with a considerable 
but rather uncertain number of species, contains the rest of the 
tou*cans. 

The monstrous serrated bill that so many toucans possess was 
by G. L. L. Buffon accounted a grave defect of nature, and it must 
be confessed that no one has given what seems to be a satisfactory 
explanation of its precise use, though on evolutionary principles none 
will now doubt its fitness to the bird's requirements. Solid as it 
looks, its weight is inconsiderable, and the perfect hinge by which 
the maxilla is articulated adds to its efficiency as an instrument 
of prehension. W. Swainson (Classif Birds, 11. 138) imagined it 
merely " to contain an infinity of nerves, disposed like net-work, all 
of which lead immediately to the nostrils," and add to the olfactory 
faculty. This notion seems to be borrowed from J. W. H. Trail 
(Trans. Linn. Society, xi. 289), who admittedly had it from Waterton, 
and stated that it was " an admirable contrivance of nature to 
increase the delicacy of the organ of smell;" but R. Owen's descrip- 
tion showed this view to be groundless, and he attributed the 
extraordinary development of the toucan's beak to the need of com- 
pensating, by the additional power of mastication thus given, for the 
absence of any of the grinding structures that are so ^ characteristic 
of the intestinal tract of vegetable-eating birds — its digestive organs 
possessing a general simplicity of formation. The nostrils are placed 
so as to be in most forms invisible until sought, being obscured by 
the frontal feathers or the backward prolongation of the horny 
sheath of the beak. The wings are somewhat feeble, and the legs 
have the toes placed in pairs, two before and two behind. The tail 
is capable of free vertical motion, and controlled by strong muscles, 
so that, at least in the true toucans, when the bird is preparing to 
sleep it is reverted and lies almost flat on the back, on which also 
the huge bill reposes, pointing in the opposite direction. 

The toucans are limited to the new world, and by far the greater 
number inhabit the north of South America, especially Guiana and 
the valley of the Amazons. Some three species occur in Mexico, and 
several in Central America. One, R. vitellinus K which^ has its head- 
quarters on the mainland, is said to be common in Trinidad, but none 
are found in the Antilles proper. They compose the family Rham- 
phastidae of Coraciiform birds, and are associated with the wood- 
peckers (Picidae) and puff-birds and jacamars (Galbulidae) ; their 
nearest allies perhaps exist among the Capitonidae, but none of these 
is believed to have the long feather-like tongue which is so charac- 
teristic of the toucans, and is, so far as known, possessed besides 
only by the Momotidae (see Motmot). But of these last there is no 
reason to deem the toucans close relatives, and according to W. 
Swainson, who had opportunities of observing both, the alleged 
resemblance in their habits has no existence. _ Toucans in confine- 
ment feed mainly on fruit, but little seems amiss to them, and they 
swallow grubs, reptiles and small birds with avidity. They nest in 



hollow trees, and lay white eggs.

TOUCH (derived through Fr. toucher from a common Teu- 
tonic and Indo-Germanic root, cf. " tug," " tuck," 0. H. Ger. 
zucchen, to twitch or draw), in physiology, a sense of pressure, 
referred usually to the surface of the body. It is often understood 
as a sensation of contact as distinguished from pressure, but it 
is evident that, however gentle be the contact, a certain amount 
of pressure always exists between the sensitive surface and the 
body touched. Mere contact in such circumstances is gentle 
pressure; a greater amount of force causes a feeling of resistance 
or of pressure referred to the skin; a still greater amount causes a 
feeling of muscular resistance, as when a weight is supported 
on the palm of the hand; whilst, finally, the pressure may be so 
great as to cause a feeling of pain. The force may not be exerted 

4 Readers of F. Bates's Naturalist on the River Amazons will 
recollect the account (ii. 344) and^ illustration there given of his 
encounter with a flock of this species of toucan. His remarks on 
the other species with which he met are also excellent.

TOUCH 




vertically on the sensory surface, but in the opposite direction, 
as when a hair on a sensory surface is pulled or twisted. Touch 
is therefore the sense by which mechanical force is appreciated, 
and it presents a strong resemblance to hearing, in which the 
sensation is excited by intermittent pressures on the auditory 
organ. In addition to feeb'ngs of contact or pressure referred 
to the sensory surface, conlact may give rise to a sensation of 
temperature, according as the thing touched feels hot or cold. 
These sensations of contact, pressure or temperature are usually 
referred to the skin or integument covering the body, but they 
are experienced to a greater or less extent when any serous or 
mucous surface is touched. The skin being the chief sensory 
surface of touch, it is there -that the sense is most highly 
developed both as to delicacy in detecting minute pressures and 
as to the character of the surface touched. Tactile impressions, 
properly so called, are absent from internal mucous surfaces, as 
has been proved in men having gastric, intestinal and urinary 
fistulae. In these cases, touching the mucous surface caused 
pain, and not a true sensation of touch. 

In the article Nerve (Spinal) the cutaneous distribution of the 
organs of touch is dealt with. 

The Amphibia and Reptilia do not show any special organs of 
touch. The lips of tadpoles have tactile papillae. Some snakes 
have a pair of tentacles on the snout, but the tongue is probably 
the chief organ of touch in most serpents and lizards. All reptiles 
possessing climbing powers have the sense of touch highly developed 
in the feet. 

Birds have epithelial papillae on the soles of the toes that are no 
doubt tactile. These are of great length in the capercailzie (Tetrax 

urogallus), "enabling it to 
grasp with more security the 
Frosted branches of the Nor- 
wegian pine trees " (Owen). 
Around the root of the bill 
in many birds there are 
special tactile organs, assist- 
ing the bird to use it as a kind 
of sensitive probe for the de- 
tection in soft ground of the 
worms, grubs and slugs that 
constitute its food. Special 
bodies of this kind have been 
detected in the beak and 
tongue of the duck and goose, called the tactile corpuscles of F. S. 
Merkel, or the corpuscles of Grandry (fig. i). Similar bodies have 
been found in the epidermis of man and mammals, in the outer 
root-sheath of tactile hairs or feelers. They consist of small bodies 
composed of a capsule enclosing two or more flattened nucleated 
cells, piled in a row. Each corpuscle is separated from the others 
by a transparent protoplasmic disk. Nerve fibres terminate either 
in the cells (Merkel) or in the protoplasmic intercellular matter 
(Ranyier, Hesse, Izquierdo). Another form of end-organ has been 
described by Herbst as existing in the mucous membrane of the duck's 
tongue. These corpuscles of Herbst are like small Pacinian corpuscles 
with thin and very close lamellae. Develop- 
ments of integument devoid of feathers, 
such as the " wattles " of the cock, the 
" caruncles " of the vulture and turkey, 
are not tactile in their function. 

In the great majority of Mammalia the 
general surface of the sldn shows sensitive- 
ness, and this is developed to a high degree 
on certain parts, such as the lips, the end 
of a teat and the generative organs. 
Where touch is highly developed, the skin, 
more especially the epidermis, is thin and 
devoid of hair. In the monkeys tactile 
papillae are found in the skin of the fingers 
and palms, and in the skin of the prehen- 
sile tails of various species (Aleles). Such 
papillae also abound in the naked skin of 
the nose or snout, as in the shrew, mole, pig, tapir and elephant. 
In the Ornithorhynchus the skin covering the mandibles is tactile 
(Owen). In many animals certain hairs acquire great size, length 
and stiffness. These constitute the vibrissae or whiskers. Each 
large hair grows from a firm capsule sunk deep in the true skin, 
and the hair bulb is supplied with sensory nerve filaments. In 
the walrus the capsule is cartilaginous in texture. The marine 
Carnivora have strong vibrissae which " act as a staff, in a way 
analogous to that held and applied by the hand of a blind man *' 
(Owen). Each species has hairs of this kind developed on the 
eyebrows, lips or cheeks, to suit a particular mode of existence, 
as, for example, the long fine whiskers of the night-prowling 
felines, and in the aye-aye, a monkey having nocturnal habits.

puscle from the hand. 



In the Ungulata the hoofs need no delicacy of touch as regards 
the discrimination of minute points. Such animals, however, have 
broad, massive sensations of touch, enabling them to 
appreciate the firmness of the soil on which they tread, 
and under the hoof we find highly vascular and sen- 
sitive lamellae or papillae, contributing 
no doubt, not only to the growth of the 
hoof, but also to its sensitiveness. The 
Cetacea have numerous sensory papillae 
in the skin. Bats have the sense of 
touch strongly developed in the wings 
and external ears, and in some species 
in the flaps of skin found near the nose. 
There is little doubt that many special 
forms of tactile organs will be found in 
animals using the nose or feet for bur- 
rowing. A peculiar end-organ has been 
found in the nose of the mole, while there 
are " end-capsules " in the tongue of the 
elephant and " nerve rings " in the ears 
of the mouse.

End-Organs of Touch in Man. — In 
man three special forms of tactile 
end-organs have been described, and can be readily demon- 
strated. 

1. The End- Bulbs of Krause. — These are oval or rounded 
bodies, from 3^- to -j^r of an inch long. Each consists of a 
delicate capsule, composed of nucleated connective tissue

enclosing numerous minute cells. On tracing the nerve fibre, 
it is found that the nerve sheath is continuous with the capsule, 
whilst the axis cylinder of the nerve divides into branches 
which lose themselves among the cells. W.. Waldeyer and 
Longworth state that the nerve fibrils terminate in the cells, 
thus making these bodies similar to the cells described by F. S. 
Merkel (ut supra). (See fig. 4.) These bodies are found in the 
deeper layers of the conjunctiva, margins of the lips, nasal 
mucous membrane, epiglottis, fungiform and circumvallate 
papillae of the tongue, glans penis and clitoris, mucous membrane 
of- the rectum of man, and they have also been found on the 
under surface of the " toes of the guinea-pig, ear and body of 
the mouse, and in the wing of the bat " (Landois and Stirling). 
In the genital organs aggregations of end-bulbs occur, known 
as the " genital corpuscles of Krause " (fig. 3). In the synovial 
membrane of the joints of the fingers there are larger end-bulbs, 
each connected with three four nerve-filaments. 

(2) The Touch Corpuscles of Wagner and Meissner. — These 
are oval bodies, about -g-J-^ of an inch long by -^j- of an inch in 
breadth. Each consists of a series of layers of connective tissue 
arranged transversely, and containing in the centre granular 
matter with nuclei (figs. 2, 3 and 6). One, two or three 
nerve fibres pass to the lower end of the corpuscle, wind 
transversely around it, lose the white substance of Schwann, 
penetrate into the corpuscle, where the axis cylinders, dividing, 
end in some way unknown. The corpuscles do not contain 
any soft core, but are apparently built up of irregular septae 
of connective tissue, in the meshes of which the nerve fibrils 
end in expansions similar to Merkel's cells. Thin describes 
simple and compound corpuscles according to the number of 
nerve fibres entering them. These bodies are found abundantly

in the palm of the hand and sole of the foot, where there 
may be as many as 21 to every square millimetre (1 mm. = 
-5^ inch). They are not so numerous on the back of the 
hand or foot, mamma, lips and tip of the tongue, and they 
are rare in the genital organs. 

3 . The Corpuscles of Vater or 
Pacini. — These, first described, by 
Vater so long ago as 1741? are small 
oval bodies, quite visible to the naked 
eye, from ^ to ^ of an inch long and \&\.\ f

-fa to tV°f an inch in breadth, attached to the nerves of the 
hands and feet. They can be readily demonstrated in the 
mesentery of the cat (fig. 7). Each corpuscle consists of 40 to 
50 lamellae or coats, like the folds of an onion, thinner and 
closer together on approaching the centre. Each lamella is 
formed of an elastic material mixed with delicate connective- 
tissue fibres, .and the inner surface of each is lined by a single 
continuous layer of endothelial cells. A double-contoured nerve 
fibre passes to each. The white substance of Schwann becomes 
continuous with the lamellae, whilst the axis cylinder passes into 
the body, and ends in a small knob or in a plexus. Some- 
times a blood-vessel also penetrates the Pacinian body, entering 
along with the nerve. Such bodies are found in the sub- 
cutaneous tissue on the nerves of the fingers and toes, near 
joints, attached to the nerves of the abdominal plexuses of 
the sympathetic, on the coccygeal gland, on the dorsum 
of the penis and clitoris, in the meso-colon, in the course 
of the intercostal and periosteal nerves, and in the capsules of 
lymphatic glands. 

Physiology of Touch in Man. — Such are the special end-organs 
of touch. It has also been ascertained that many sensory 
nerves end in a plexus or network, the ultimate fibrils being 
connected with the cells of the particular tissue in which they 
are found. Thus they exist in the cornea of the eye, and at 
the junctions of tendons with muscles. In the latter situation 
*' flattened end-flakes or plates " and " elongated oval end- 
bulbs " have also been found. A consideration of these 
various types of structure show that they facilitate intermittent 
pressure being made on the nerve endings. They are all, as it 
were, elastic cushions into which the nerve endings penetrate, 
so that the slight variation of pressure will be transmitted to 
the nerve. Probably also they serve to break the force of a 
sudden shock on the nerve endings. 

Sensitiveness and Sense of Locality. — The degree of sensitiveness 
of the skin is determined by finding the smallest distance at which 



the two points of a pair of compasses can be felt : This method 
first followed by Weber, is employed by physicians in the diagnosis

These investigations show not only that the skin is sensitive, 
but that one is able with great precision to distinguish the part 
touched. This latter power is usually called the sense of locality, 
and it is influenced by various conditions. The greater the number 
of sensory nerves in a given area of skin the greater is the degree 
of accuracy in distinguishing different points. Contrast in this 
way the tip of the finger and the back of the hand. Sensitiveness 
increases from the joints towards the extremities, and sensitiveness 
is great in parts of the body that are actively moved. The sensibility 
of the limbs is finer in the transverse axis than in the long axis of 
the limb, to the extent of i on the flexor surface of the ur^per limb 
and i on the extensor surface. It is doubtful if exercise improves 
sensitiveness, as Francis Galton found that the performances of 
blind boys were not superior to those of other boys, and he says that 
" the guidance of the blind depends mainly on the multitude of 
collateral indications, to which they give much heed, and not their 
superiority to any one of them. When the skin is moistened 
with indifferent fluids sensibility is increased. Suslowa made the 
curious discovery that, if the area between two points distinctly 
felt be tickled or be stimulated by a weak electric current, the 
impressions are fused. Stretching the skin, and baths in water 
containing carbonic acid or common salt, increase the power of 
localizing tactile impressions. In experimenting with the com- 
passes, it will be found that a smaller distance can be distinguished 
if one proceeds from greater to smaller distances than in the reverse 
direction. A smaller distance can also be detected when the points 
of the compasses are placed one after the other on the skin than 
when they are placed simultaneously. If the points of the com- 
passes are unequally heated, the sensation of two contacts becomes 
confused. An anaemic condition, or a state of venous congestion, 
or the application of cold, or violent stretching of the skin, or the 
use of .such substances as atropine, daturin, morphia, strychnine, 
alcohol, bromide of potassium, cannabin and hydrate of chloral 
blunt sensibility. The only active substance said to increase it 
is caffein.

TOUCH 



Absolute sensitiveness ; as indicated by a sense of pressure, has 
been determined by various methods. Two different weights are 

S laced on the part, and the smallest difference in- weight that can 
e perceived is noted. Weber placed small weights directly on the 
skin; Aubert and Kammler loaded small plates; Dohrn made use 
of a balance, having a blunt point at one end of the beam, resting on 
the skin, whilst weights were placed on the other end of the beam 
to equalize the pressure; H. Eulenbcrg invented an instrument like 
a spiral spring paper-clip or balance (the baraesthesiometer), having 
an index showing the pressure in grammes; F. Goltz employed 
an India-rubber tube filled with water, and this, to ensure a constant 
surface of contact, bent at one spot over a piece of cork, is touched 
at that spot by the cutaneous part to be examined, and, by rhyth- 
mically exerted pressure, waves analogous to those of the arterial 
pulse are produced in the tube; and L. Landoisinvented a mercurial 
oalance, enabling him to make rapid variations in the weight without 
giving rise to any shock. These methods have given the following 
general results, (i) The greatest acuteness is on the forehead, 
temples and back of the hand and forearm, which detect a pressure 
of o-oo2 gramme; fingers detect 0-005 to 0*015 gramme; the chin, 
abdomen and nose 0-04 to 0-05 gramme. ^ (2) Gojtz's method gives 
the same general results as Weber's experiment withthe compasses, 
with the exception that the tip of the tongue has its sensation of 
pressure much lower in the scale than its sensation of touch. (3) 
Eulenberg found the following gradations in the fineness of the 
pressure sense : the forehead, lips, back of the cheeks, and temples 
appreciate differences of iS to & (200: 205 to 300: 310 grammes). 
The back of the last phalanx of the fingers, the forearm, hand, 
first and second phalanges, the palmar surface of the hand, forearm 
and upper arm distinguish differences of **$ to ^(200: 220 to 200: 
210 grammes). The front of the leg and thigh is similar to the fore- 
arm. Then follow the back of the foot and toes, the sole of the foot, 
and the back of the leg and thigh.^ Dohrn placed a weight of 
1 gramme on the skin, and then determined the least additional weight 
that could be detected, with this result: third phalanx of finger 
°"499 gramme; back of the foot, 0-5 gramme ; second phalanx, 0-771 
gramme; first phalanx, 0-82 gramme; leg, 1 gramme; back of hand, 
1*156 grammes; palm, 1-108 grammes; patella, 1-5 grammes; fore- 
arm, i«99 grammes; umbilicus, 3*5 grammes; andback,3-8 grammes. 
(4) In passing from light to heavier weights, the acuteness increases 
at once, a maximum is reached, and then with heavy weights the 
power of distinguishing the differences diminishes. (5) A sensation 
of pressure after the weights have been removed may be^ noticed 
(after-pressure sensation) , especially if the weight be considerable. 

(6) Valentine noticed that, if the finger wereheld against a blunt- 
toothed wheel, and the wheel were rotated with a certain rapidity, 
he felt a smooth margin. This was experienced when the intervals 
of time between the contacts of successive teeth were less than from 
*lo to ihs °f a second. The same experiment can be readily made 
by holding the finger oyer the > holes in one of the outermost circles 
of a large syren rotating quickly: the sensations of individual 
holes become fused, so as to give rise to a feeling of touching a slit. 

(7) Vibrations of strings are detected even when the number is 
about 1500 per second; above this the sensation of vibration ceases. 
By attaching bristles to the prongs of tuning-forks and bringing 
these into contact with the lip or tongue, sensations of a very acute 
character are experienced, wnich are most intense when the forks 
vibrate from 600 to 1500 per second. 

Information from Tactile Impressions* — These enable us to come 
to the following conclusions. (1) We note the existenceof some- 
thing touching the sensory surface. (2) From the^ intensity of the 
sensation we determine the weight, tension or intensity of the 

Eressure. This sensation is in the first instance referred to the skin, 
ut after the pressure has reached a certain amount muscular 
sensations arc also experienced — the so-called muscular sense. 
(3) The locality of the part touched is at once determined, and from 
this the probable position of the touching body. Like the visual 
field, to which all retinal impressions are referred, point for point, 
there is a tactile field, to which all points on the skin surface may be 
referred. (4) By touching a body at various points, from the 
difference of pressure and from a comparison 01 the positions of 
various points in the tactile field we judge of the configuration of 
the body. A number of " tactile pictures are obtained by passing 
the skin over the touched body, and the shape of the body is further 
determined by a knowledge of the muscular movements necessary 
to bring the cutaneous surface into contact with different portions 
of it. If there is abnormal displacement of position, a false con- 
ception may arise as to the shape of the body. Thus, if a small 
marble or a pea be placed between the index and middle finger so 
as to touch (with the palm downwards) the outer side of the index 
finger and the inner side of the middle finger, a sensation of touching 
one round body is experienced^ but if the fingers be crossed, so that 
the marble touches the inner side of the index finger and the outer 
side of the middle finger, there will be a # feeling of two round bodies, 
because in these circumstances there is added to the feelings of 
contact a feeling of distortion (or of muscular action) such as would 
take place if the fingers, for purposes of touch, were placednn that 
abnormal position. Again, as snowing that our knowledge of the 
tactile field is precise, there is the well-known fact that when a piece 



of skin is transplanted from the forehead to the nose, in the operation 
for removing a deformity of the nose arising from lupus or other 
ulcerative disease, the patient feels the new nasal part as if it were 
his forehead, and he may have the curious sensation of a nasal 
instead of a frontal headache. (5) From the number of points 
touched we judge as to the smoothness or roughness of a body. A 
body having a uniformly level surface, like a billiard ball, is smooth; 
a body having points irregular in size and number in a given area 
is rough; and if the points are very close together it gives rise to a 
sensation, like that of the pile of velvet almost intolerable to some 
individuals. Again, if the pressure is so uniform as not to be felt, 
as when the body is immersed in water (paradoxical as this may seem, 
it is the case that the sensation of contact is felt only at the limit 
of the fluid), we experience the sensation of being in contact with a 
fluid. ^ (6) Lastly, it would appear that touch is always the result 
of variation of pressure. No portion of the body when touching 
anything can be regarded as absolutely motionless, and the slight 
oscillations of the sensory surface, and in many cases of the body 
touched, produce those variations of pressure on which touch 
depends. 

To explain the phenomenon of the tactile field, and more specially 
the^ remarkable variations of tactile sensibility above described, 
various theories have been advanced, but none are satisfactory. 
(See article 4I Cutaneous Sensations " by C. S. Sherrington in 
Schafer's Physiology, ii. 920). Research shows that the sensation 
of touch may be referred to parts of the skin which do not contain 
the special end organs associated with this sense, and that filaments 
in the Malpighian layer (the layer immediately above the papillae 
of the true skin) may form the anatomical basis of the sense. The 
skin may be regarded, also, as an extensive surface containing 
nervous arrangements by which we are brought into relation with 
the outer world. # Accordingly, touch is not the only sensation 
referred to the skin, but we also refer sensations of temperature 
(heat and cold), and often those peculiar sensations which we call 
pain. 

Sensations^ of Temperature. — These depend on thermic irritation 
of the terminal organs, as proved by the following experiment of 
E. H. Weber: " If the elbow be dipped into a verv cold fluid, the 
cold is only felt: at the immersed part of the body (where the fibres 
terminate) ; pain, however, is felt in the terminal organs of the ulnar 
nerve, namely* in the finger points; this pain, at the same time, 
deadens the local sensation of cold." If the sensation of cold were 
due to the irritation of a specific-nerve fibre, the sensation of cold 
would be referred to the tips of the fingers. When any part of the 
skin is above its normal mean temperature, warmth is felt; in the 
opposite case, cold. The normal mean temperature of a given area 
varies according to the distribution of hot blood in it and to the 
activity of nutritive changes occurring in it. When the skin is brought 
into contact with a good conductor^ of heat there is a sensation of 
cold. A sensation of heat is experienced when heat is carried to 
the skin in any way. The following are the chief facts that have 
been ascertained regarding the temperature sense: (1) E. H. 
Weber found that, with a skin temperature of from 1 5 • 5 ° C. to 35 C. , 
the tips of the fingers can distinguish a difference of 0-25° C. to 0*2° C. 
Temperatures just below that of the blood (33°-27° C.) are 
distinguished by the most sensitive parts, even to 0-05° C. (2) The 
thermal sense varies in different regions as follows: tip of tongue, 
eyelids, cheeks, lips, neck, belly. The " perceptible minimum " was 
found to be, in degrees C: breast 0*4°; back,o-9°; back of hand, 0-3°; 
palm, 0*4°; arm, 0*2°; back of foot, 0-4°; thigh, 0*5°; leg, o-6° to 0-2°; 
cheek, o-£°; temple, 0-3°. (3) If two different temperatures are applied 
side by side and simultaneously, the impressions often fuse, especially 
if the areas are close together. (4) Practice is said to improve the 
thermal sense. (5) Sensations of heat and cold may curiously 
alternate; thus when the skin is dipped first into water at io° C. 
we feci cold, and if it be then dipped into water at 16 C. we have at 
first a feeling of warmth, but soon again of cold. (6) The same 
temperature applied to a large area is not appreciated .in the same 
way as when applied to a small one; thus the whole hand when 
placed in water at 29*5° C. feels warmer than when a finger is 
dipped into water at 32 C. " 

There is every reason to hold that there are different nerve fibres 
and different central organs for the tactile and thermal sensations, 
but nothing definite is known. t The one sensation undoubtedly 
affects the other. Thus the minimum distance at which two com- 
pass points are felt is diminished when one point is warmer than 
the other. Again, a colder weight is felt as heavier, " so that the 
apparent difference of pressure becomes greater when the heavier 
weight is at the same time colder, and less when the lighter weight 
is colder, and difference of pressure is felt with equal weights of 
unequal temperature" (E ; H. Weber). Great sensibility to differ- 
ences of temperature is noticed after removal, alteration by vesicants, 
or destruction of the epidermis, and in the skin affection called 
herpes zoster. Thesameoccurs in some cases of locomotor ataxy. 
Removal of the epidermis, as a rule, increases tactile sensibility 
and the sense of locality. Increased tactile sensibility is termed 
hyper pselaphesia, and is a rare phenomenon in nervous diseases. 
Paralysis o^ the tactile sense is called hypopselaphesia t whilst its 
entire loss is apselaphesia. Brown-Sequard mentions a case in 



TOUCH 



97 



which contact of two points gave rise to a sense of a third point of 
contact. Certain conditions of the nerve centres affect the senses 
both of touch and temperature. Under the influence of morphia 
the person may feel abnormally enlarged or diminished in size. As 
a rule the senses are affected simultaneously, but cases occur where 
one may be affected more than the other. 

Sensations of heat and cold are chiefly referred to the skin, and 
only partially to some mucous membranes, such as those^ of the 
alimentary canal. Direct irritation of a nerve does not give rise 
to these sensations. The exposed pulp of a diseased tooth, when 
irritated by hot or cold fluids, gives rise to pain, not to sensations 
of temperature. It has now been ascertained that there are minute 
areas on the skin in which sensations of heat and cold may be more 
acutely felt than in adjoining areas; and, further, that there are 
points stimulated by addition of heat, hot spots, while others are 
stimulated by withdrawal of heat, cold spots^ 

A simple method of demonstrating this phenomenon is _ to 
use a solid cylinder of copper, 8 in. in length by^ in. in thick- 
ness, and sharpened at one end to a fine pencil-like point. Dip 
the pointed end into very hot water, close the eyes, and touch 
parts of the skin. When a hot- spot is touched, there is an acute 
sensation of burning. Such a spot is often near a hair. Again, 
in another set of experiments, dip the copper pencil into ice-cold 
water and search for cold spots. When one of these is touched, a 
sensation of cold, as if concentrated on a point, is experienced. Thus 
it may be demonstrated that in a given area of skin there may be 
hot spots, cold spots and touch spots. 

Cold spots are more abundant than hot^ spots. The spots are 
arranged in curved lincs^ but the curve uniting a number of cold 
spots does not coincide with the curve forming a chain of hot spots. 
By Weber's method it will be found that we can discriminate cold 
spots at a shorter distance from each other than hot spots. Thus 
on the forehead cold spots have a minimum distance of 8 mm., and 
hot spots 4 mm.; on the skin of the breast, cold spots 2 mm., and 
hot spots 5 mm.; on the back, cold spots 1*5 mm., and hot spots 
4 to 6 mm.; on the back of the hand, cold spots 3 mm., and hot 
spots 4 mm.; cm the palm, cold spots 8 mm., and hot spots 2 mm.; 
and on the thigh and leg, cold spots 3 mm., and hot spots 3*5 mm. 
Electrical and mechanical stimulation of the hot' or cold spots call 
forth the corresponding sensation. No terminal organ for dis- 
crimination of temperature has yet been found. It will be observed 
that the sensation of heat or cold is excited by change of temperature, 
and that it is more acute and definite the more sudden the change. 
Thus discrimination of temperature is similar to discrimination of 
touch, which depends on more or less sudden change of pressure. 
The term cold means, physiologically, the sensation we experience 
when heat is abstracted, and the term heat, the sensation felt when 
heat is added to the part. Thus we are led to consider that the skin 
contains at least two kinds of specific terminal organs for sensations 
of touch and temperature, and two sets of nerve fibres which carry 
the nervous impulses to the brain. In all probability, also, these 
fibres have different central endings, and in their course to the brain 
run in different tracts in the spinal cord. This will explain cases 
of disease of the central nervous system in which, over certain areas 
of skin, sensations of touch have been lost while sensations of tem- 
perature and pain remain, or vice versa. Tactile and thermal 
impressions may influence each other. Thus a leg sent to "sleep" 
by pressure on the sciatic nerve will be found to be less sensitive 
to heat, but distinctly sensitive to cold. In some cases of disease 
it has been noticed that the skin is sensitive to a temperature above 
that of the limb, but insensitive to cold. It is highly probable that 
just as we found in the case of touch (pressure), the terminal organs 
connected with the sense of temperature arc the fine nerve^ filaments 
that have been detected in the deeper strata of the Malpighian region 
of the epidermis, immediately above the true skin, and it is also 
probable that certain epidermic (epithelial) cells in that region 
play their part in the mechanism. Sensations of a painful character 
may also, in certain circumstances, ^be^ referred to the viscera, and 
to mucous and serous surfaces. Pain is not a sensation excited by 
irritating^ the end organs either of touch or of temperature, nor 
even by irritating directly the filaments of a sensory nerve. Even 
if sensory nerves are cut or bruised, as in surgical operations, there 
may be no sensations of pain ; and it has been found that muscles, 
vessels and even the viscera, such as the heart, stomach, liver or 
kidneys, may be freely handled without giving rise to any feeling 
of pain, or indeed to any kind of sensation. These parts, in ordinary 
circumstances appear to be insensitive, and yet they contain afferent 
nerves. If the sensibility of these nerves is heightened, or possibly 
if the sensitiveness of the central terminations of the nerves is raised, 
then we may have sensations to which we give the name of pain. 
In like manner the skin is endowed with afferent nerves, distinct 
from those ministering to touch and to temperature, along which 
nervous impulses are constantly flowing. When these nervous 
impulses reach the central nervous system in ordinary circumstances 
they do not give rise to changes that reach the level of consciousness, 
but they form, as it were, the warp and woof of our mental life, and 
they also affect metabolisms, that is to say, nutritive changes in 
many parts of the body. They may also, as is well known, affect 
unconsciously such mechanisms as those of the action of the heart, 
the calibre of the blood-vessels and the movements of respiration. 

XXVII. 4 



If, however, this^ plane of activity is raised, as by intermittent 
pressure, or by inflammatory action, or by sudden changes of 
temperature, as in burning, scalding, &c., such nervous impulses give 
rise to pain. Sometimes pain is distinctly located, and in other 
cases it may be irradiated in the nerve centres, and referred to areas 
of skin or to regions of the body which are not really the seat of 
the irritation. Thus irritation of the liver may cause pain in the 
shoulder ; disease of the hip-joint often gives rise to pain in the knee ; 
and renal colic, due to the passage of a calculus down the ureter, 
to severe pain even in the abdominal walls. These are often 
termed rtftex pains and their interpretation is of great importance 
to physicians in the diagnosis of disease. Their frequent occurrence 
has also directed attention to the distribution in the skin and 
termination in the brain of the sensory nerves. It is also notice- 
able that a^ sensation of pain gives us no information as to its 
cause; we simply have an agonizing sensation in a part to which, 
hitherto, we probably referred no sensations. The acuteness or 
intensity of pain depends partly on the intensity of the irritation, 
and partly on the degree of excitability of the sensory nerves at 
the time. 

Pain. — In addition to sensations of touch and of temperature 
referred to the skin, there is still athird kind of sensation, unlike 
cither, namely, pain. This sensation cannot be supposed to be 
excited by irritations of the end organs of touch, or of specific 
thermal end organs (if there be such), but rather to irritation of 
ordinary sensory nerves, and there is every reason to believe that 
painful impressions make their way to the brain along special tracks 
in the spinal cord. If we consider our mental condition as regards 
sensation at any moment, we notice numerous sensations more or 
less definite, not referred directly to the surface, nor to external 
objects, such as a feeling of general comfort, free or impeded breath- 
ing, hunger, thirst, malaise, horror, fatigue and pain. These are 
all caused by the irritation of ordinary sensory nerves in different 
localities, and if the irritation of such nerves, by chemical, thermal, 
mechanical or nutritional stimuli, passes beyond a certain maximum 
point of intensity the result is pain. Irritation of a nerve, in accord- 
ance with the^ law of " peripheral reference of sensation," will cause 
pain. Sometimes the irritation applied to the trunk of a sensory 
nerve may be so intenseas to destroy its normal function, and loss 
of sensation or anaesthesia results. If then the stimulus be increased 
further, pain is excited which is referred to the end of the nerve, with 
the result of producing what has been called anaesthesia dolorosa. 
Pains frequently cannot be distinctly located, probably owing to 
the fact 01 irradiation in the nerve centres and subsequent reference 
to areas of the body which are not really the seat of irritations. 
The intensity of pain depends on the degree of excitability of the 
sensory nerves, whilst its massiveness depends on the number of 
nerve fibres affected. The quality of the pain is probably produced 
by the kind of irritation of the nerve, as affected by the structure 
01 the part and the greater or less continuance of severe pressure. 
Thus there are piercing, cutting, boring, burning, throbbing, pressing, 
gnawing, dull and acute varieties of pain. Sometimes the excitability 
of the cutaneous nerves is so great that a^ breath of air or a delicate 
touch may give rise to suffering. This hyperalgia is found in 
inflammatory affections of the skin. In neuralgia the pain is charac- 
terized by its character of shooting along the course of the nerve 
and by severe exacerbations. In many nervous diseases there 
arc disordered sensations referred to the skin, such as alterna- 
tions of heat and cold, burning, creeping, itching and a feeling as 
if insects were crawling on the surface (formication). This con- 
dition is termed paralgia. The term hypalgia is applied to a 
diminution and analgia to paralysis of pain, as is produced by 
anaesthetics. 

Muscular Sense. — The sensory impressions considered in this 
article are closely related to the so-called muscular sense, or that 
sense or feeling by which we are aware of the state of the muscles of 
a limb as regards contraction or relaxation. Some have held that 
the muscular sense is really due to greater or less stretching of the 
skin and therefore to irritation of the rterves of that organ. That 
this is not the case is evident from the fact that disordered move- 
ments indicating perversion or loss of this sense are not affected by 
removal of the skin (Claude Bernard). Further, cases in the human 
being have been noticed where there was an entire loss of cutaneous 
sensibility whilst the muscular sense was unimpaired. It is also 
known that muscles possess sensory nerves, giving rise, in certain 
circumstances, to fatigue, and, when strongly irritated, to the pain 
of cramp. Muscular sensations are really excited by irritation of 
sensory nerves passing from the muscles themselves. There are 
specialized spindle-like bodies in many muscles, and there are organs 
connected with tendons which are regarded as sensory organs by 
which pressures are communicated to sensory- nerve-filaments. 
We are thus made conscious of whether or not the muscles arc 
contracted, and of the amount of contraction necessary to overcome 
resistance, and this knowledge enables us to judge of the amount 
of voluntary impulse. Loss or diminution of the muscular sense 
is seen in chorea and especially in locomotor ataxy. Increase of 
it is rare, but it is seen in the curious affection called anxietas 
tibiarum, a painful condition of unrest, which leads to a continual 
change in the position of the limbs (see Equilibrium).

TOUL— TOULON 



TOUL, a garrison town of north-eastern France, capital of an 
arrondissementin the department of Meurthe-et-Moselle, 21 m. 
W. of Nancy on the Eastern railway Pop. (1906), town 9523; 
commune, 13,663. Toul is situated in a plain on the left bank 
of the Moselle, which skirts the town on the S. and S. E., while 
on the N. it is bordered by the Marne-Rhine canal. It is princi- 
pally important as being the centre of a great entrenched camp 
close to the German frontier. Immediately after the Franco- 
German War the whole system of frontier defence was revised, 
and of all the new fortresses of the Meuse and Moselle Toul is 
perhaps the most formidable. The works were begun in 1874 
by the construction of four outlying forts north, north-east 
and south of the town, but these soon became merely 
an inner line of defence. The principal defences now lie 
much farther out on all sides. The west front of the 
new line of forts occupies a long line of high ground (the 
watershed of the Meuse and the Moselle), the north front, 
about 4 m. from Toul, is in undulating country, while facing 
towards Nancy and forming the chord of the arc which 
the Moselle describes from Fontenay below to Villey-le-Sec 
above, is the strong east front,- the outlying works of which 
extend far to the east (Fort Frouard and other works 
about Nancy) and to the south-east (Pont St Vincent). 
The south front extends from the Moselle at Villey-le- 
Sec south-westwards till it meets the southern end of the 
west front on the high ground overlooking the Meuse 
valley. The fort at Pagny on the Meuse to the south-west 
may be considered an outwork of this line of defence. The 
perimeter of the Toul defences proper is nearly 30 m., and 
their mean distance from the town about 6 m. Northward, 
along the Meuse, Toul is connected with the fortress of Verdun 
by the " Meuse line " of barrier forts, the best known of which 
are Gironville, Liouville and Troyon. South of Toul the country 
was purposely left unfortified as far as fipinal (q.v.) and this 
region is known as the Trouee d'fipinal. 

The town itself forms an oval within a bastioned enceinte 
pierced by three gateways. It has two important churches. 
That of St fitienne (formerly a cathedral) has a choir and 
transept of the 13th century; the nave and aisles are of the 14th, 
and the facade, the finest part of the building, of the last half of 
the 15th. The two western towers, which have no spires, reach 
a height of 246 ft. The two large lateral chapels of the nave are 
in the Renaissance style. The chief features of the interior 
are its stained glass and organ loft. South of the church there 
is a fine cloister of the end of the 13th century which was 
much damaged at the Revolution. The church of St 
Gengoult, which dates chiefly from the late 13th or early 14th 
century, has a facade of the 15th century and a cloister in the 
Flamboyant Gothic style of the 16th century. The h6tel- 
de-ville occupies a building of the 18th century, once the epis- 
copal palace, and contains the library and museum. Toul 
is the seat of a* sub-prefect and has a tribunal of commerce 
and a communal college among its public institutions. The 
industries include the manufacture of porcelain; trade is in 
wine and brandy. 

Toul (Tullum) is one of the oldest towns of France; originally 
capital of the Leuci, in the Belgic Confederation, it acquired 
great 'importance under the Romans. It was evangelized by 
St Mansuy in the latter half of the 4th century, and became 
one of the leading sees of north-east Gaul. After being sacked 
successively by Goths, Burgundians, Vandals and Huns, Toul 
was conquered by the Franks in 450. Under the Merovingians 
it was governed by counts, assisted by elective officers. The 
bishops became sovereign counts in the 10th century, holding 
only of the emperor, and for a period of 300 years (13th to 16th 
centuries) the citizens maintained a long struggle against 
them. Together with Verdun and Metz the town and its 
domain formed the territory of the Trois-Eveches. Toul was 
forced to yield for a time to the count of Vaudemont in the 12th 
century, and twice to the duke of Lorraine in the 15th, and was 
thrice devastated by the plague in the 16th century. Charles V. 
made a solemn entry into the town in 1544, but in the following 



year, at the instance of the cardinal of Lorraine, it'placed 
itself under the perpetual protection of the kings of France. 
Henry II. took possession of the Trois-Evech6s in 1552, but the 
territory was not officially incorporated with France till 1648. 
Henry IV. was received in state in 1603, and in 1637 the 
parlement of Metz was transferred to Toul. In 1700 Vauban 
reconstructed the fortificatidns of the town. In 1790 the 
bishopric was suppressed and the diocese united to that of 
Nancy. Toul, which had then no modern defences, capitulated 
in 1870 after a bombardment of twelve days. 

TOULON, a seaport and first-class fortress and naval station 
of France, department of Var, capital of the arrondissement 
of Toulon, on the Mediterranean, 42 m. E.S.E. of Marseilles. 
Pop. (1886), 53,941; (1901), 101,602. The bay, which' 
opens to the east, has two divisions, the Grande Rade 
and the Petite Rade; it is sheltered on the north and 
west by high hills, closed on the south by the peninsula of 
capes Side and Cepet, and protected on the east by a huge 
breakwater, the entrance, 1300 ft. wide, being defensible by 
torpedoes. A ship coming from the open sea must first 
pass the forts of St Marguerite, of Cap Brun, of Lamalgue 
and of St Louis to the north, and the battery of the signal 
station to the south; before reaching the Petite Rade it must 
further pass under the guns of the battery of Le Salut to the 
east, and of the forts of Balaguier and L'Aiguillette to the west. 
The Bay of La Seyne lies west of the Petite Rade, and is 
defended by the forts of Six-Fours, Napoleon (formerly Fort 
Caire), and Malbousquet, and the batteries of Les Arenes and 
Les Gaus. To the north of Toulon rise the defensive works 
of Mont Faron and Fort Rouge, to the east the forts of Artigues 
and St Catherine, to the north-east the formidable fort of 
Coudon, and to the south-east that of Colle Noire, respectively 
dominating the highway into Italy and the valley of Hyeres 
with the Bay of Carqueiranne. The town, enlarged to the 
north under the Second Empire, has on that side a fine modern 
quarter; but in the old town the streets are for the most part 
narrow, crooked and dirty, and to their insanitary state the 
cholera epidemic of 1884 was attributed. The chief buildings 
are the former cathedral of St Marie Majeure (from the 5th 
century Toulon was a bishop's see till 1801, when it was annexed 
to that of Frejus), the church of St Louis, the naval and military 
hospital, with a natural history collection and an anatomical 
museum attached, a naval school of medicine, a school of 
hydrography, and large barracks. In 1883-1887 a handsome 
Renaissance building was erected to accommodate the picture 
gallery and the town library. The monument in com- 
memoration of the centenary of the French Revolution was 
erected in 1890 in the Place de la Libert6, the finest in the 
new town. The imports are wine, corn, wood, coal, hemp, iron, 
sugar, coffee and fresh fish; the exports are salt, copper ore, 
barks for tanning and oils. The principal industries, apart 
from the arsenal, are shipbuilding, fishing, lace-making and 
wine-growing. Toulon possesses an observatory and a 
botanical garden. The interesting buildings and gardens of 
the hospital of St Mandrier stand on the peninsula of Cape 
Cepet, and near them is the lazaretto. 

Toulon is the most important of the French dockyards, and is 
the headquarters of the Mediterranean fleet. The arsenal, which 
was created by Louis XIV. — Vauban being the engineer of the 
works — lies on the north side of the Petite Rade. This is ap- 
proached from the Grande Rade by passages at the north and 
south ends of a long breakwater which extends from the direction 
of Le Mourillon towards the Cepet Peninsula. The water space 
within the moles amounts to about 150 acres, while the quays 
approach 4 m. in length. Outside in the Petite Rade is a splendid 
protected anchorage for a great fleet, the whole being commanded 
by many forts and batteries. There are four great basins ap- 
proached from the Petite Rade — the Vielle Darse, to the east, 
on the side of Le Mourillon; the Darse Vauban, next to it; and the 
Darse de Castigneau and the Darse Missiessy, farther to the west. 
In the Darse Vauban are three dry docks, two of them 246 ft. long, 
with a depth of water on the sill of about 20 ft. ; while the third 
is 283 ft. long, with a depth of over 24 ft. Three other dry docks are 
in the Darse de Castigneau, of which one is in two sections. The 
largest of the docks is 385 ft. long, and the depth of water on the 
sill in all these docks averages 30 ft. In the Darse Missiessy are 



TOULOUSE, COUNT OF— TOULOUSE 



two dry docks, 426 ft. long, with a depth on the sill of over 32 ft. 
There are several building slips, and the yard is supplied with 
a gun foundry and wharf, fitting-shops, boiler works, victualling 
and other establishments, rolling mills and magazines. Le Mourillon 
is a subsidiary yard at Toulon, devoted chiefly to ship-building, 
and possessing large facilities, including five covered slips. 

The Roman Telo Martius is supposed to have stood near 
the lazaretto. The town was successively sacked by 
Goths, Burgundians, Franks and Saracens. During the 
early " middle ages, and till conquered by Charles of Anjou 
in 1259, it was under lords of its own, and entered into alli- 
ance with the republics of Marseilles and Aries. St Louis, 
and * especially Louis XII. and Francis I. strengthened 
its fortifications. It was seized by the emperor Charles V. 
in 1524 and 1536. Henry IV. founded a naval arsenal at 
Toulon, which was further strengthened by Richelieu, and 
Vauban made the new dock, a new enceinte, and several 
forts and batteries. In 1707 the town was unsuccessfully 
besieged by the duke of Savoy, Prince Eugene and an English 
fleet. In 1720 there was an outbreak of the plague. In 1792 
after great and sanguinary disorder, the royalists of the town 
sought the support of the English and Spanish fleets cruising 
in the neighbourhood. The Convention having replied by 
putting the town " hors la loi," the inhabitants opened their 
harhour to the English. The army of the republic now (1793) 
laid siege to the town, and on this occasion Napoleon Bonaparte 
first made his name as a soldier. The forts commanding the 
town having been taken, the English ships retired after setting 
fire to the arsenal. The conflagration was extinguished by 
the prisoners, but not before 38 out of a total of 56 vessels had 
been destroyed. Under the Directory Toulon became the 
most important French military fort on the Mediterranean; 
here Napoleon organized the Egyptian campaign, and the 
expedition against Algiers set out from Toulon in 1830. The 
fortifications have been strengthened by Napoleon I., Louis 
Philippe, Napoleon III., and since 1870. 

Battle of Toulon. — This naval battle took place on the nth of 
February 1744, near the port of Toulon. A British fleet of thirty 
sail of the line under command of Thomas Mathews, who combined 
the offices of naval commander-in-chief in the Mediterranean and 
envoy to the courts of Sardinia and the Italian princes, engaged 
a combined force of Spaniards under Don Jose* Navarro and French 
under M. de Court. They were in all twenty-seven sail. The allies 
left Toulon on the 9th of February. Mathews was at anchor in 
Hyeres Bay to watch them, for though France and Great Britain 
were already engaged as allies on opposite sidesin the War of the 
Austrian Succession, there had been no declaration of war between 
them. It was known that the allies meant to transfer Spanish 
troops to Italy to serve against the Austrians, and Mathews had no 
hesitation in attacking them, Great Britain being at war with 
Spain. He left Hyeres in very light wind with a heavy westerly 
swell, and with his fleet in confusion. The British ships were strag- 
gling over a distance of ten miles, but he put himself between the 
enemy and Toulon. Mathews was on bad terms with his second 
in command, Lestock, who commanded the rear division and showed 
little disposition to support his superior. By the morning of the 
nth the interval between the van and centre of the British fleet 
and its rear had increased in the light breezes, and also through 
the voluntary or involuntary misapprehension of Mathews's orders 
by Lestock. The allies were in a fairly well-formed line, heading 
to the south, and southward of the British. Mathews pursued, 
and at 1.30 p.m., when his leading ship was abreast of the centre 
ship of the allies, he attacked. Some hot fighting took place 
between Mathews and the Spaniards who formed the allied rear. 
The action was notable as the last occasion on which an attempt 
was made to use a fireship on the open sea. One was sent against 
the " Real " (114), the Spanish flagship, but she was reduced to a 
sinking state by the fire of the Spaniards, and blew up prematurely, 
with the loss of all on board. At about five o'clock, the French 
in the van turned back to support the Spaniards, and Mathews drew 
off. One Spanish ship, the " Poder " (60), which had surrendered 
was recaptured, and then set on fire by the allies. Mathews made 
only a feeble attempt to renew the battle on the following days, 
and on the 13th returned towards the coast of Italy, which he said 
he had to defend. The British rear division haa not come into 
action at all. 

The battle, though a miserable affair in itself, is of great impor- 
tance in naval history because of the pronouncement of doctrine 
to which it led. Mathews, who was dissatisfied with his subordinate, 
Lestock, suspended him from command and sent him home for 
trial. Several of the captains had behaved ill, and the failure of 



99 

a superior British fleet to gain a success over the allies caused 
extreme discontent at home. A parliamentary inquiry was opened 
on the 1 2th of March 1745, which on the 18th of April, after a 
confused investigation, ended in a petition to the king; to order 
trials by court-martial of all the officers accused of misconduct. 
A long series of courts-martial began on the nth of September 
1745, and did not end till the 22nd of October 1746. Several 
captains were sentenced to be dismissed the service. Lestock was 
acquitted, but Mathews was condemned and sentenced to dis- 
missal. The finding of the court, which blamed the officer who 
actually fought, and acquitted the other who did not, puzzled and 
angered public opinion. The technical points were not appreci- 
ated by laymen. The real evil done by the condemnation of 
Mathews was not understood even in the navy. Mathews was 
blamed on the ground that he had not waited to engage till his 
van ship was abreast of the van ship of the enemy. By this declara- 
tion of principle the court confirmed the formal system of naval 
tactics which rendered all sea-fighting between equal or nearly 
equal forces so ineffective for two generations.

TOULOUSE, LOUIS ALEXANDRE DE BOURBON, Count op 
(1678-1737), third son of Louis XIV. and Mme de Montespan 
was born on the 6th of June 1678. At the age of five he was 
created admiral of France. He distinguished himself during 
the War of the Spanish Succession, and inflicted a severe 
defeat on Admiral Rooke near Malaga in 1704. He kept 
aloof from the intrigues of his sister-in-law, the duchess of 
Maine, and died on the 1st of December 1737. His son, Louis 
Jean Marie de Bourbon, due de Penthievre (1 725-1 793), succeeded 
his father in his posts, among others in that of grand admiral. 
He served under Marshal de Noailles, and fought brilliantly 
at Dettingen (1743) and Fontenoy (1745). He then lived in 
retreat at Rambouillet and Sceaux, protecting men of letters, 
and particularly the poet Florian, and dispensing charity. 
He lost his son, the prince of Lamballe, in 1768, and survived 
his daughter-in-law, Louise Marie Therese of Savoy-Carignan, 
the friend of Marie Antoinette, who was killed by the populace 
on the 3rd of September 1792. He died on the 4th of March 
1793; his daughter and heiress, Louise Marie Adelaide, married 
Philippe (figalite), duke of Orleans. 

TOULOUSE, a city of south-western France, capital of the 
department of Haute-Garonne, 443 m. S. by W. of Paris by 
the Orleans railway, and 159 m. S.E. of Bordeaux by the 
Southern railway. Pop. (1 906) , town, 1 25,856; commune; 
149,438. Toulouse is situated on the right bank of the Garonne, 
which here changes a north-easterly for a north-westerly 
direction, describing a curve round which the city extends in the 
form of a crescent. On the left bank is the suburb of St Cyprien, 
which is exposed to the inundations of the river owing to its 
low situation. The river is spanned by three bridges — that 
of St Pierre to the north, that of St Michel to the south, and 
the Pont Neuf in the centre; the last, a fine structure of seven 
arches was begun in 1543 by Nicolas Bachelier, the sculptor, 
whose work is to be seen in many of the churches and mansions 
of the city. East and north of the city runs the Canal du 
Midi, which here joins the lateral canal of the Garonne. Between 
the Canal du Midi and the city proper extends a long line of 
boulevards leading southwards by the Allee St fitienne to the 
Grand Rond, a promenade whence a series of allees branch out 
in all directions. South-west the Allee St Michel leads towards 
the Garonne, and south the Grande Allee towards the Faubourg 
St Michel. These boulevards take the place of the old city 
walls. Between them and the canal lie the more modern 
faubourgs of St Pierre, Arnaud-Bernard, Matabiau, &c. The 
Place du Capitole, to which streets converge from every side, 
occupies the centre of the city. Two broad straight thorough- 
fares of modern construction, the Rue de Metz and the Rue 
d'Alsace-Lorraine, intersect one another to the south of this 
point, the first running east from the Pont Neuf, the other 
running north and south. The other streets are for the most 
part narrow and irregular. 

The most interesting building in Toulouse is the church of St 
Sernin or Saturnin, whom legend represents as the first preacher 
of the gospel in Toulouse, where he was perhaps martyred about 
the middle of the 3rd century. The choir, the oldest part of the 



IOO 



TOULOUSE 



present building, was consecrated by Urban II. in 1096. The 
church is the largest Romanesque basilica in existence, being 
375 ft. from east to west and 210 ft. in extreme breadth. The nave 
(12th and 13th centuries) has double aisles. Four pillars, support- 
ing the central tower, are surrounded by heavy masonry, which 
somewhat spoils the general harmony of the interior. In the 
southern transept is the " portail des comtes," so named because 
near it lie the tombs of William Taillefer, Pons, and other early 
counts of Toulouse. The little chapel in which these tombs (as- 
cribed to the 1 ith century) are found was restored by the capitols 
of Toulouse in 1648. Another chapel contains a Byzantine Christ 
of late 11th-century workmanship. The choir (nth and 12th 
centuries) ends in an apse, or rather chevet, surrounded by a range 
of columns, marking off an aisle, which in its turn opens into five 
chapels. The stalls are of 16th-century work and grotesquely 
carved. Against the northern wall is an ancient table d'autel, 
which an 11th-century inscription declares to have belonged to 
St Sernin. In^ the crypts are many relics, which, however, were 
robbed of their gold and silver shrines during the Revolution. 
On the south there is a fine outer porch in the Renaissance style; 
it is surmounted by a representation of the Ascension in Byzantine 
style. ^ The centra^ tower (13th century) consists of five storeys, 
of which the two highest are of later date, but harmonize with the 
three lower ones. A restoration of St Sernin was carried out in 
the 19th century by Viollet-le-Duc. 

The cathedral, dedicated to St Stephen, dates from three different 
epochs. The walls of the nave belong to a Romanesque cathedral 
of the nth century, but its roof dates from the first half of the 
13th century. The choir was begun by Bishop Bertrand de l'lle 
(c. 1272X who wished to build another church in place of the old 
one. This wish was unfulfilled and the original nave, the axis of 
which is to the south of that of the choir, remains. The choir was 
burned in 1690 but restored soon after. It is surrounded by seven- 
teen chapels, finished by the cardinal d'Orleans, nephew of Louis XI., 
about the beginning of the 16th century, and adorned with glass 
dating from the 15th to the 17th century. The western gate, 
flanked by a huge square tower, was constructed by Peter du 
Moulin, archbishop of Toulouse, from 1439 to 1451. It has been 
greatly battered, and presents but^ a poor approximation to its 
ancient beauty. Over this gate, which was once ornamented with 
the statues of St Sernin, St Exuperius and the twelve apostles, 
as well as those of the two brother archbishops of Toulouse, Denis 
(1423-1439) and Peter du Moulin, thereis a beautiful 13th-century 
rose-window, whose centre, however, is not in a perpendicular 
line with the point of the Gothic arch below. 

Among other remarkable churches may be noticed Notre-Dame 
de la Daurade, near the Pont Neuf, built on the site of a 9th-century 
Benedictine abbey and reconstructed towards the end of the 18th 
century; and Notre-Dame de la Dalbade; perhaps existing in the 
nth, but in its present form dating from the 16th century, with 
a fine Renaissance portal. The church of the Jacobins, held by 
Viollet-le-Duc to be " one of the most beautiful brick churches 
constructed in the middle ages," was built * towards the end of 
the 13th century, and consists of a nave divided into two aisles 
by a range of columns. The chief exterior feature is a beautiful 
octagonal belfry. The church belonged to a Dominican monastery, 
of which part of the cloister, the refectory, the chapter-hall and the 
chapel also remain and are utilized by the lycee. Of the other 
secular buildings the most noteworthy are the capitole and the 
museum. The capitole has a long Ionic facade built from 1750 
to 1760. The theatre is situated in the left wing. Running along 
almost the whole length of the first floor is the salle des tllustres 
adorned with modern paintings and sculptures relating to the history 
of the town. The museum (opened in 1795) occupies, besides a 
large modern building, the church, cloisters and other buildings 
of an old Augustinian^ convent. It contains pictures and a splendid 
collection of antiquities, notably a series of statues and busts of 
Roman emperors and others and much Romanesque sculpture. 
There is an auxiliary museumin the old college of St Raymond. 
The natural history museum is in the Jardin des Plantes. The 
law courts stand on the site of the old Chateau Narbonais, once 
the residence of the counts of Toulouse and later the seat of the 
parlement of Toulouse. Near by is a statue of the jurist Jacques 
Cujas, born at Toulouse. 

Toulouse is singularly rich In mansions of the 16th and 17th 
centuries. Among these may be mentioned the H6tel Bernuy, 
a fine Renaissance building now used by the lycee and the H6tel 
d'Assezat of the same period, now the property of the Academic 
des Jeux Floraux (see below), and of the learned societies of the city. 
In the court of the latter there is a statue of C16mence Isaure, a 
lady of t Toulouse, traditionally supposed to have enriched the 
Academie by a bequest in the 15th century. The Maison de Pierre 
has an elaborate stone facade of 1612. 

Toulouse is the seat of an archbishopric, of a court of appeal, 
a court of assizes and of a prefect. It is also the headquarters 
of the XVII. army corps and centre of an educational circum- 
scription (academie). There are tribunals of first instance and of 
commerce, a board of trade-arbitration, a chamber of commerce 
and a branch of the Bank of France. The educational institutions 
include faculties of law, medicine and pharmacy, science and 



letters, a Catholic institute with faculties of theology and 'letters, 
higher and lower ecclesiastical seminaries, lycees and training colleges 
for both sexes, and schools of veterinary science, fine arts and 
industrial sciences and music. 

Toulouse, the principal commercial and industrial centre of 
Languedoc, has important markets for horses, wine, grain, flowers, 
leather, oil and farm produce. Its pastry and other delicacies 
are^ highly esteemed. Its industrial establishments include the 
national tobacco factory, flour-mills, saw-mills, engineering work- 
shops and factories for farming implements, bicycles, vehicles, 
artificial manures, paper, boots and shoes, and flour pastes. 

Tolosa, chief town of the Volcae Tectosages, does not 
seem to have been a place of great importance during the early 
centuries of the Roman rule in Gaul, though in 106 B.C. the 
pillage of its temple by Q. S. Cepio, afterwards routed by the 
Cimbri, gave rise to the famous Latin proverb habet aurum 
Tolosanum y in allusion to ill-gotten gains. It possessed a 
circus and an amphitheatre, but its most remarkable remains 
are to be found on the heights of Old Toulouse (vetus Tolosa) 
some 6 or 7 m. to the east, where huge accumulations of 
broken pottery and fragments of an old earthen wall mark 
the site of an ancient settlement. The numerous coins that 
have been discovered on the same spot do not date back farther 
than the 2nd century B.C., and seem to indicate the position 
of a Roman manufacturing centre then beginning to occupy 
the Gallic hill-fortress that, in earlier days, had in times of 
peril been the stronghold of the native tribes dwelling on the 
river bank. Tolosa does not seem to have been a Roman 
colony; but its importance must have increased greatly towards 
the middle of the 4th century. It is to be found entered in 
more than one itinerary dating from about this time; and 
Ausonius, in his Ordo nobilium urbium^ alludes to it in terms 
implying that it then had a large population. In 419 it was 
made the capital of his kingdom by Wallia, king of the Visigoths, 
under whom or whose successors it became the seat of the 
great Teutonic kingdom of the West-Goths — a kingdom that 
within fifty years had extended itself from the Loire to Gibraltar 
and from the Rhone to the Atlantic. On the defeat of Alaric 
II. (507) Toulouse fell into the hands of Clovis, who carried 
away the royal treasures to Angouleme. Under the Merovingian 
kings it seems to have remained the greatest city of southern 
Gaul, and is said to have been governed by dukes or counts 
dependent on one or other of the rival kings descended from 
the great founder of the Prankish monarchy. It figures pro- 
minently in the pages of Gregory of Tours and Sidonius 
Apollinaris. About 628 Dagobert erected South Aquitaine 
into a kingdom for his brother Charibert, who chose Toulouse 
as his capital. For the next eighty years its history is obscure, 
till wc reach the days of Charles Martel, when it was besieged 
by Sema, the leader of the Saracens from Spain (c. 715-720), 
but delivered by Eudes, " princeps Aquitaniae," in whom 
later writers discovered the ancestor of all the later counts of 
Toulouse. Modern criticism, however, has discredited this 
genealogy; and the real history of Toulouse recommences in 
780 or 781, when Charlemagne appointed his little son Louis 
king of Aquitaine, with Toulouse for his chief city. 

During the minority of the young king his tutor Chorson 
ruled at Toulouse with the title of duke or count. Being 
deposed at the Council of * Worms (790), he was succeeded by 
William Courtnez, the traditional hero of southern France, 
who in 806 retired to his newly founded monastery at Gellone, 
where he died in 812. In the unhappy days of the emperor 
Louis the Pious and his children Toulouse suffered in common 
with the rest of western Europe. It was besieged by Charles 
the Bald in 844, and taken four years later by the Normans, who 
in 843 had sailed up the Garonne as far as its walls. About 852 
Raymond I., count of Quercy, succeeded his brother Fridolo as 
count of Rouergue and Toulouse; it is from this noble that all 
the later counts of Toulouse trace their descent. Raymond I.'s 
grandchildren divided their parents* estates; of these Ray- 
mond II. (d. 924) became count of Toulouse, and Ermengaud, 
count of Rouergue, while the hereditary titles of Gothia, Quercy 
and Albi were shared between them. Raymond II.'s grandson, 
William Taillefer (d. c. 1037), married Emma of Provence, and 



TOUNGOO— TOUP, J. 



IOI 



handed down part of that lordship to his younger son Bertrand. 1 
William's elder son Pons left two children, of whom William IV. 
succeeded his father in Toulouse, Albi, Quercy, &c; while 
the younger, Raymond IV. of St Gilles (c. 1066), made him- 
self master of the vast possessions of the counts of Rouergue, 
married his cousin the heiress of Provence, and about 1085 began 
to rule the immense estates of his elder brother, who was still 
living. 

From this time the counts of Toulouse were the greatest 
lords in southern France. Raymond IV., the hero of the first 
crusade, assumed the formal titles of marquis of Provence,' 
duke of Narbonne and count of Toulouse. While Raymond 
was away in the Holy Land, Toulouse was seized by William 
IX., duke of Aquitaine, who claimed the city in right of his 
wife Philippa, the daughter of William IV., but was unable 
to hold it long (1098-1100). Raymond's son and successor 
Bertrand followed his father's example and set out for the 
Holy Land in 1109, leaving his great estates at his death to 
his brother Alphonse Jourdain. The rule of this prince was 
disturbed by the ambition of William IX. and his grand-daughter 
Eleanor, who urged her husband Louis VII. to support her 
claims to Toulouse by war. On her divorce from Louis and 
her marriage with Henry II., Eleanor's claims passed on to this 
monarch, who at last forced Raymond V. to do him homage for 
Toulouse in 1 1 73. Raymond V., the patron of the troubadours, 
died in 1194, and was succeeded by his son Raymond VI., 
under whose rule Languedoc was desolated by the crusaders of 
Simon de Montfort, who occupied Toulouse in 1215, but lost 
his life in besieging it in 1218. Raymond VII., the son of 
Raymond VI. and Princess Joan of England, succeeded his 
father in 1222, and died in 1249, leaving an only daughter 
Joan, married to Alfonso the brother of Louis IX. On the 
death of Alfonso and Joan in 1271 the vast inheritance of the 
counts of Toulouse lapsed to the Crown. 2 From the middle 
years of the 12th century the people of Toulouse seem to have 
begun to free themselves from the most oppressive feudal 
dues. An act of Alphonse Jourdain (1141) exempts them from 
the tax on salt and wine; and in 1152 we have traces of a 
" commune consilium Tolosae " making police ordinances in 
its own name " with the advice of Lord Raymond, count of 
Toulouse, duke of Narbonne, and marquis of Provence." This 
act is witnessed by six " capitularii," four duly appointed 
judges (judices constituti), and two advocates. Twenty-three 
years later there are twelve capitularii or consuls, six for the 
city and six for its suburbs, all of them elected and sworn to do 
justice in whatever municipal matters were brought before 
them. In 1222 their number was increased to twenty-four; 
but they were forbidden to touch the city property, which 
was to remain in the charge of certain " communarii " chosen 
by themselves. Early in the 14th century the consuls took 
the name of " doinini de capitulo," or, a little later, that of 
" capitulum nobilium." From the 13th century the consuls 
met in their own house, the " palatium communitatis Tolosae " 
or h6tel-de-ville. In the 16th century a false derivation 
changed the ancient consuls (domini de capitulo) into the modern 
" capitouls " (domini capitolii tolosani), a barbarous etymology 
which in its turn has, in the present century, transformed 
the old assembly house of Toulouse into the capitole. The 

1 About 975 there was a partition of the estates which William 
Taillefer and his cousin Raymond II. of Auvergne held in common, 
— Albi, Quercy, &c., falling to William, and Gothia, &c, to 
Raymond.

parlement of Toulouse was established as a permanent court 
in 1443- Louis XI. transferred it to Montpellier in 1467, but 
restored it to Toulouse before the close of the next year. This 
parlement was for Languedoc and southern France what the 
parlement of Paris was for the north. During the religious 
wars of the 16th century the Protestants of the town made 
two unsuccessful attempts to hand it over to the prince de 
Conde. After St Bartholomew's Day (1572) 300 of the party 
were massacred. Towards the end of the 16th century, during 
the wars of the League, the parlement was split up into 
three different sections, sitting respectively at Carcassonne or 
Beziers, at Castle Sarrasin, and at Toulouse. The three were 
reunited in 1596. Under Francis I. it began to persecute heretics, 
and in 1619 rendered itself notorious by burning the philosopher 
Vanini. In 1762 Jean Calas, an old man falsely accused of 
murdering his eldest son to prevent him becoming a Reman 
Catholic, was broken on the wheel. By the exertions of Voltaire 
his character was ' afterwards rehabilitated. The university 
of Toulouse owes its origin to the action of Gregory IX., who 
in 1229 bound Raymond VII. to maintain four masters to 
teach theology and eight others for canon law, grammar, and 
the liberal arts. Civil law and medicine were taught only a 
few years later. The famous " Floral Games " of Toulouse, 
in which the poets of Languedoc contended (May 1-3) for the 
prize of the golden amaranth and other gold or silver flowers, 
given at the expense of the city, were instituted in 1323-1324. 
The Academic des J tux Floraux still awards these prizes for 
compositions in poetry and prose. In 1814 the duke of 
Wellington defeated Marshal Soult to the north-east of the 
towu.

TOUNGOO, or Taung-ngu, a town and district in the Tenas- 
serim division of Lower Burma. The town is situated on the 
right bank of the river Sittang, 166 m. by rail N. from Rangoon. 
Pop. (1901), 15,837. From the 14th to the 16th century it was 
the capital of an independent kingdom. After the second 
Burmese War it was an important frontier station, but the 
troops were withdrawn in 1893. The district of Toungoo 
has an area of 6172 sq. m.; pop. (1901), 279,315, showing an 
increase of 32% in the preceding decade. Three mountain 
ranges traverse the district — the Pegu Yomas, the Karen, 
and the Nat-taung or " Great Watershed " — all of which have 
a north and south direction, and arc covered for the most 
part with dense forest. The Pegu Yomas have a general 
elevation of from 800 to 1200 ft., while the central range averages 
from 2000 to 3000 ft. The rest of Toungoo forms the upper 
portion of the valley of the Sittang, the only large river in the 
district, the chief tributaries of which are the Shwa, Hkabaung, 
Hpyu Thank-ye-Kat and Yank-thua-wa, all navigable for a 
great portion of their course. Limestone appears in various 
places, and in the north-east a light grey marble is quarried for 
lime. The rivers form the chief means of communication during 
the rainy season. The rainfall in 1905 was 80-30 in. There 
are 14 railway statioris in the district. Rice is the staple 
crop; there are promising plantations of coffee and rubber. 
Forests cover more than 5000 sq. m., of which 1337 sq. m. 
have been reserved, yielding a large revenue. 

TOUP, JONATHAN [Joannes Toupius] (1713-1785), English 
classical scholar and critic, was born at St Ives in Cornwall, 
and was educated at a private school and Exeter College, 
Oxford. Having taken orders, he became rector of St Martin's 
Exeter, where he died on the 19th of January 1785. Toup 
established his reputation by his Emendationes in Suidam 
(1760-1766, followed in 1775 by a supplement) and his edition 
of Longinus (1778), including notes and emendations by 
Ruhnken. The excellence of Toup's scholarship was " known 
to the learned throughout Europe " (so epitaph on the tablet 
in the church of East Looe set up by the delegates of the 
Clarendon Press), but his overbearing manner and extreme 
self-confidence made him many enemies.

TOURACOU— TOURAINE 



TOURACOU, the name, evidently already in use, under 
which in 1743 G. Edwards figured a pretty African bird, 1 and 
presumably that applied to it in Guinea, whence it had been 
brought alive. It is the Cuculus persa of Linnaeus, and Turacus 







(After Schlegel.) 

White-Crested Tburacou (Turacus albicrisiatus). 
or Corythaix persa of later authors. Cuvier in 1799 or 1800 
Latinized its native name (adopted in the meanwhile by both 
French and German writers) as above, for which barbarous 
term J. K. W. Uliger, in 181 1, substituted a more classical 
word. In 1788 Isert described and figured (Beobacht. Gesellsck. 
naturf. Freunde, iii. 16-20, pi. 1) a bird, also from Guinea, 
which he called Musophaga violacea. Its affinity to the original 
Touracou was soon recognized, and both forms have been 
joined by modern systematists in the family Musophagidae, 
commonly Englished Plantain-eaters or Touracous. 

To take first the Plantain-eaters proper, or the genus Musophaga, 
of which only two species are known. One, about the size of a 
crow, is comparatively common in museums, and has the horny 
base of its yellow bill prolonged backwards over the forehead in 
a kind of shield. The top of the head and the primaries, except 
their outer edge and tip, are deep crimson ; a white streak extends 
behind the eye; and the rest of the plumage is glossy purple. The 
second species, M. rossae, which is rare, chiefly differs by wanting 
the white eye-streak. Then of the Touracous — the species origin- 
ally described is about the size of a jay, and has the head, crest 
(which is vertically compressed and tipped with red), neck and breast 
of grass-green, varied by two white streaks — one, from the gape 
to the upper part of the crimson orbit, separated by a black patch 
from the other, which runs beneath and behind the eye. The 
wing-coverts, lower part of the back, and tail are of steel-purple, 
the primaries deep crimson, edged and tipped with bluish black. 
Over a dozen other congeneric species, more or less resembling 
this, have been described, and all inhabit some district of Africa. 
One, found in the Cape Colony and Natal, where it is known as 
the " Lory " (cf. xv. 7, note 1), though figured by Daubcnton and 
others, was first differentiated in 1841 by^ Strickland (Ann. Nat. 
History, vii. 33) as Turacus albicristatus — its crest having a con- 
spicuous white border, while the steel-purple of T, persa is replaced 
by a rich and glossy bluish green of no less beauty. In nearly all 
the species of this genus the nostrils are almost completely hidden 
bv the frontal feathers; but there are two others in which, though 
closely allied, this is not the case, and some systematists would 
place^ them in a separate genus Gallirex; while another species, 
the giant of the family, has been moved into a third genus as Cory- 
ihaeola cristata. This differs from any of the foregoing by the 
absence of the crimson coloration of trie primaries, and seems to 
lead to another group, Schizorrhis, in which the plumage is of a 
still plainer type, and, moreover, the nostrils here are not only 
exposed but in the form of a slit, instead of being oval as in all the 



1 Apparently the first ornithologist to make the bird known was 
Albin, who figured k in 1738 from the life, yet badly, as "The 
Crown-bird of Mexico." He had doubtless been misinformed as 
to its proper country; but Touracous were called " Crown-birds " 
by the Europeans in West Africa, as witness Bosnian's Description 
of the Coast of Guinea (2nd ed., 1721), p. 251, and W. Smith's Voyage 
to Guinea (1745), p. 149, though the name was also given to the 
crowned cranes, Baleartca. 



rest. This genus contains about half-a-dozen species, one of which, 
5. concolor, is the Grey Touracou of the colonists in Natal, and is 
of an almost uniform slaty brown. A good deal has been written 
about these birds, which form the subject of a beautiful monograph 
— De Toerako's afgebeld en beschreven — by Schlegel and Westerman, 
brought out at Amsterdam in i860; while further information is 
contained in an elaborate essay by Schalow (Journ. f. ornithologie, 
1886, pp. 1-77). Still, much remains to be made known as to their 
distribution throughout Africa and their habits. They seem to 
be all fruit-eaters, and to frequent the highest trees, seldom coming 
to the ground. Very little can be confidently asserted as to their 
nidification, but at least one species of Schizorrhis is said to make 
a rough nest and therein lay three eggs of a pale blue colour. An 
extraordinary peculiarity attends trie crimson coloration which 
adorns the primaries of so many of the Musophagidae. So long 
ago as 1818, Jules Verreaux observed (Proc. Zool. Society, 1871, 
p. 40) that in the case of T. albicristatus this beautiful hue vanishes 
on exposure to heavy rain and reappears only after some interval 
of time and when the feathers are dry. 3 

The Musophagidae form a distinct family, of which the Cuculidae 
are the nearest allies, the two being associated to torm the Cuculine 
as compared with the Psittacine division of Cuculiform birds 
(see Bird and Parrot). T. C. Eyton pointed out (Ann. Nat. 
History, 3rd series, vol. ii. p. 458) a # feature possessed in common by 
the latter and the Musophagidae, in the " process attached to the 
anterior edge of the ischium," which he likened to the so-called 
" marsupial " bones of Didelphian mammals. J. T. Reinhardt 
has also noticed ( Vidensk. meddels. naturhist. forening, 1 87 1 , 
pp. 326-341) another Cuculine character offered by the osuncina* 
turn affixed to the lower side of the ethmoid in the Plantain-eaters 
and Touracous; but too much dependence must not be placed on 
that, since a similar structure is presented by the frigate-bird (g.v.) 
and the petrels (q.v.). A corresponding process seems also to be 
found in Trogon (q.v.). The bill of nearly all the species of Muso- 
phagidae is curiously serrated or denticulated along the margin 
and the feet have the outer toe reversible, but usually directed 
backwards. No member of the family is found outside of the 
continental portion of the Ethiopian region. (A. N.) 

TOURAINE, an old province in France, which stretched 
along both banks of the Loire in the neighbourhood of Tours, 
the river dividing it into Upper and Lower Touraine. It 
was bounded on the N. by Orleanais, W. by Anjou and 
Maine, S. by Poitou and E. by Berry, and it corresponded 
approximately to the modern department of Indre et Loire. 
Touraine took its name from the Turones, the tribe by which it 
was inhabited at the time of Caesar's conquest of Gaul. They 
were unwarlike, and offered practically no resistance to the 
invader, though they joined in the revolt of Vercingetorix 
in a.d. 52. The capital city, Caesarodunum, which was built 
on the site of the eastern part of the present city of Tours, 
was made by Valentinian the metropolis of the 3rd Lyon- 
naise, which included roughly the later provinces of Touraine, 
Brittany, Maine and Anjou. Christianity seems to have been 
introduced into Touraine not much earlier than the beginning 
of the 4th century, although tradition assigns St Gatien, the 
first bishop of Tours, to the 3rd. The most famous of its 
apostles was St Martin (fl. 375-400), who founded the 
abbey of Marmoutier, near Tours, and whose tomb in the 
city became a celebrated shrine. Tours was besieged by the 
Visigoths in 428, and though it offered a successful resistance 
on this occasion it was included fifty years later in the territory 
of the Visigoths. The Tourangeans refused to adopt the 
Arian heresy of their conquerors, and this difference in religion 
materially assisted in 507 the conquest of the province by 
Clovis, whose orthodoxy was guaranteed by the miraculous 
intervention of St Martin. St Clotilda, wife of Clovis, spent 
the last years of her life in retreat at Tours. The possession 
of Touraine was constantly the subject of dispute between 
the Merovingian princes, and the province enjoyed no settled 
peace until the reign of Charlemagne, He established Alcuin 
as abbot of St Martin of Tours, and under his auspices the 
school of Tours became one of the chief seats of learning in 

1 The fact of this colouring matter being soluble in water was 
incidentally mentioned at a meeting of the Zoological Society of 
London by W. B. Tegetmeier, and brought to the notice of Professor 
A. H. Church, who, after experiment, published in 1868 (Student 
and Intellectual Observer, i. 161-168) an account of it as " Turacin, 
a new animal pigment containing copper." Further information 
6n the subject was given by^Monteiro (Chem. News, xxviii. 201; 
Quart. Journ. Science, 2nd series, vol. iv. p. # 132). The property is 
possessed by the crimson feathers of all the birds of the family.

the middle ages. In the 9th century Tours also became the 
ecclesiastical metropolis of Brittany, Maine and Anjou, and 
when the empire was divided by Louis the Pious into various 
districts or missatica. Tours was the centre of one of these, 
the boundaries of which corresponded roughly with those of 
the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the city. Touraine suffered 
from the invasions of the Northmen, who massacred the 
monks of Marmoutier in 853, but never pillaged Tours. The 
administration of Touraine was entrusted, from Merovingian 
times onward, to counts appointed by the crown. The office 
became hereditary in 940 or 941 with Thibault the Old or the 
" Tricheur." His son Odo I. was attacked by Fulk the Black, 
count of Anjou, and despoiled of part of his territory. His 
grandson Thibault III., who refused homage to Henry I., 
king of France, in 1044, was entirely dispossessed by Geoffrey 
of Anjou, called the Hammer (d. 1060). The 7th count, 
Fulk (d. 1 109), ruled both Anjou and Touraine, and the county 
of Touraine remained under the domination of the counts of 
Anjou (q.v.) until Henry II. of England deprived his brother 
Geoffrey of Touraine by force of arms. Henry II. carried out 
many improvements, but peace was destroyed by the revolt 
of his sons. Richard Coeur de Lion, in league with Philip 
Augustus, had seized Touraine, and after his death Arthur of 
Brittany was recognized as count. In 1204 it was united to 
the French crown, and its cession was formally acknowledged 
by King John at Chinon in 1214. Philip appointed Guillaumc 
des Roches hereditary seneschal in 1204, but the dignity was 
ceded to the crown in 1312. Touraine was granted from time 
to time to princes of the blood as an appanage of the crown of 
France. In 1328 it was held by Jeanne of Burgundy, queen 
of France; by Philip, duke of Orleans, in 1344; and in 1360 
it was made a peerage duchy on behalf of Philip the Bold, 
afterwards duke of Burgundy. It was the scene of dispute 
between Charles, afterwards Charles VII., and his mother, 
Isabel of Bavaria, who was helped by the Burgundians. After 
his expulsion from Paris by the English Charles spent much 
of his time in the chateaux of Touraine, although his seat of 
government was at Bourges. He bestowed the duchy successively 
on his wife Mary of Anjou, on Archibald Douglas and on Louis 
III. of Anjou. It was the dower of Mary Stuart as the widow of 
Francis II. The last duke of Touraine was Francis, duke of 
Alencon, who died in 1584. Plessis-les-Tours had been the 
favourite residence of Louis XI., who granted many privileges 
to the town of Tours, and increased its prosperity by the 
establishment of the silk-weaving industry. The reformed 
religion numbered many adherents in Touraine, who suffered 
in the massacres following on the conspiracy of Amboise; 
and, though in 1562 the army of Conde pillaged the city of Tours, 
the marshal of St Andre reconquered Touraine for the Catholic 
party. Many Huguenots emigrated after the massacre of 
St Bartholomew, and after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes 
the silk industry, which had been mainly in the hands of the 
Huguenots, was almost destroyed. This migration was one 
of the prime causes of the extreme poverty of the province 
in the next century. At the Revolution the nobles of 
Touraine made a declaration expressing their sympathy 
with the ideas of liberty and fraternity. Among the many 
famous men who were born within its boundaries are Jean 
le Meingre Boucicaut, marshal of France, Beroalde de Verville, 
author of the Moyen de parvenir, Rabelais, Cardinal Richelieu, 
C.J. Avisseau, the potter (1796-1861), the novelist Balzac 
and the poet Alfred de Vigny.

TOURCOING, a manufacturing town of northern France 
in the department of Nord, less than a mile from the Belgian 
frontier, and 8 m. N.N.E. of Lille on the railway to 



Ghent. Pop. (1906), 62,694 (commune, 81,671), of whom 
about one-third are natives of Belgium. Tourcoing is prac- 
tically one with Roubaix to the south, being united thereto by 
a tramway and a branch of the Canal de Roubaix. The public 
institutions comprise a tribunal of commerce, a board of trade 
arbitrators, a chamber of commerce, an exchange and a condi- 
tioning house for textiles. Together with Roubaix, Tourcoing 
ranks as one of the chief textile centres of France. Its chief 
industry is the combing, spinning and twisting of wool 
carried on in some eighty factories employing between 
10,000 and 12,000 workpeople. The spinning and twisting 
of cotton is also important. The weaving establishments 
produce woollen and mixed woollen and cotton fabrics together 
with silk and satin drapery, swanskins, jerseys and other fancy 
goods. The making of velvet pile carpets and upholstering 
materials is a speciality of the town. To these industries 
must be added those of dyeing, the manufacture of hosiery, 
of the machinery and other apparatus used in the textile factories 
and of soap. 

Famed since the 12th century for its woollen manufactures, 
Tourcoing was fortified by the Flemings in 1477, when LouisXI. 
of France disputed the inheritance of Charles the Bold 
with Mary of Burgundy, but in the same year was taken and 
pillaged by the French. In 1794 the Republican army, under 
Generals Moreau and Souham, gained a decisive victory over 
the Austrians, the event being commemorated by a monument 
in the public garden. The inhabitants, 18,000 in 1789, were 
reduced by the French Revolution to 10,000. 

TOURMALINE, a mineral of much interest to the physicist 
on account of its optical and electrical properties; it is 
also of some geological importance as a rock-constituent 
(see Schorl), whilst certain transparent varieties have economic 
value as gem-stones. The name is probably a corruption 
of turmoil, or toramalli, the native name applied to tourmaline 
and zircon in Ceylon, whence specimens of the former mineral 
w r ere brought to Europe by the Dutch in 1703. The green 
tourmaline of Brazil had, however, been known here much 
earlier; and coarse varieties of the mineral had passed for cen- 
turies under the German name of Schorl, an old mining word 
of uncertain origin, possibly connected with the old German 
Schor (refuse), in allusion to the occurrence of the mineral with 
the waste of the tin-mines. The German village of Schorlau 
may have taken its name from the mineral. It has been 
suggested that the Swedish iorm'skorl has possible connexion 
with the word skor } brittle. 

Tourmaline crystallizes in the rhombohedral division of the 
hexagonal system. The crystalshave generally a prismatic habit, the 
prisms being longitudinally striated or even channelled. Trigonal 
prisms are characteristic^ so that a transverse section becomes 
triangular or often nine-sided. ^ By combination of several prisms 
the crystals may become sub-cylindrical. The crystals when doubly 
terminated are often hemimorphic or present dissimilar forms at 
the opposite ends; thus the hexagonal 
prisms in fig. I arc terminated at one end 
by rhombohedral faces, 0, P, and at the 
other by the basal plane k'. Doubly- 
terminated crystals, however, are com- 
paratively rare; the crystals being usually 
attached at one end to the matrix. It is 
notable that prismatic crystals of tour- 
maline have in some cases been curved 
and fractured transversely; the displaced 
fragments having been cemented together 
by deposition of fresh mineral matter. Tourmaline is not infre- 
quently columnar, acicular or fibrous; and the fibres may radiate 
from a centre so as to form the sp-called "tourmaline suns." 
Crystals of tourmaline present no distinct cleavage, but break with 
a sub-conchoidal fracture; and whilst the general lustre of the 
mineral is vitreous, that of the fractured surface is rather pitchy. 
The hardness is slightly above that of quartz ^ (7). The specific 
gravity varies according to chemical composition, that of the 
colourless varieties being about 3, whilst in schorHt may rise to 3*2. 

Tourmaline has a great range of colour, and in many cases the 
crystals are curiously parti-coloured. Occasionally, though rarely, 
the mineral is colourless, and is then known as achroite, a name 
proposed by R. Hermann in 1845^ and derived from the Greek 
&XP°os (uncoloured). Red^ tourmaline, which when of fine colour 
is the most valued of all varieties, is known as rubellite (q.v.). Green 
tourmaline is by no means uncommon, but the blue is rather rare

TOURNAI 



and is distinguished by the name indigolite, generally written indi- 
colite. Brown is a common colour, and black still more common, 
this being the usual colour of schorl, or common coarse tourmaline. 
Thin splinters of schorl may, however, be blue or brown by 
transmitted light. 

The double refraction of tourmaline is strong. The mineral is 
optically negative, the ordinary index being about 1*64, and the 
extraordinary 1-62. Coloured tourmalines are intensely pleochroic, 
the ordinary ray, which vibrates perpendicular to the principal axis, 
being much more strongly absorbed than the extraordinary; hence 
a slice cut in the direction of the principal or optic axis trans- 
mits sensibly only the extraordinary ray, and may consequently be 
used as a polarizing medium. ^ The brown tourmaline of Ceylon and 
Brazil is best adapted for this purpose, but the green is also used. 
Two plates properly mounted form the instrument used by opticians 
for testing spectacle-lenses, and are known as the " tourmaline tongs." 
In order to secure the best colour-effect when used as a gem-stone, 
the tourmaline should be cut with the table parallel to the optic 
axis. 

It was in tourmaline that the phenomenon of pyroelectricity was 
first observed. On being heated in peat ashes its attractive power 
was observed by the Dutch, in the early part of the 18th century; 
and this curious character obtained for it the name of ascktrekker, 
or ash-drawer. J. R. Hauy first pointed out the relation of pyroelec- 
tricity with hemimorphism. Tourmaline is also piezoelectric, that 
is, it becomes electric by pressure. If a crystal be subjected to 
pressure along the optic axis, it behaves as though it were contracting 
by reduction of temperature. The mineral may also be rendered 
electric by friction, and retains the charge for a long time. 

Tourmaline is a boro-silicate of singularly complex composition. 
Indeed the word tourmaline is sometimes regarded as the name of 
a group of isomorphous minerals rather than that of a definite 
species. Numerous analyses have been made, and the results 
discussed by a large number of authorities. In the view of S. L. 
Penfield and H. W. Foote all tourmaline may be^ derived from a 
boro-silicic acid of the formula HjoBjGUC^i. It is believed that 
the hydrogen is present as hydroxyl, and that this may be partially 
replaced by fluorine. The tourmaline acid has probably the con- 
stitution His(B*OH) 2 SuOi9. Nine atoms of hydrogen are replaced 
by three of aluminium, and the remaining nine in part by other 
metals. Lithium is present in red tourmaline; magnesium dominates 
in brown; iron, manganese and sometimes chromium are found 
in green; and much iron occurs in the black varieties. Four groups 
are sometimes recognized, characterized by the presence of (1) 
lithium, (2) ferrous iron, (3) ferric iron and (4) magnesium. 

Tourmaline occurs commonly in granite, greisen, gneiss and 
crystalline schists. In many cases it appears to have been formed 
by pneumatolysis, or the action on the rocks of heated vapours 
containing boron and fluorine, as in many tin-bearing districts, 
where tourmaline is a characteristic mineral. Near the margin 
of a mass of granite the rock often becomes schorlaceous or tourma- 
liniferoiis, and may pass into " tourmaline-rock," which is usually 
an aggregate of tourmaline and quartz. Tourmaline is an essential 
constituent of the west of England rocks called luxullianite (luxuly- 
anite) and trowlesworthite. It occurs embedded in certain meta- 
morphic limestones, where it is possibly due to fumarolic action. 
Microscopic crystals are common in clay-slate.^ ^ By resistance to 
decomposition, tourmaline often survives the disintegration of the 
matrix, and thus passes into sands, clays, marls and other 
sedimentary deposits. 

Many of the finest crystals of tourmaline occur in druses in 
granitic rocks, such as those of San Piero in Elba, where some of 
the pale pink and green prisms are tipped with black, and have 
consequently been called nigger-heads. Lepidolite is a common 
associate of tourmaline, as at Rozena in Moravia. Tourmaline 
occurs, with corundum, in the dolomite of Campolongo, in canton 
Ticino, Switzerland. Fine black crystals, associated with apatite 
and quartz, were formerly found in granite at Chudleigh, near 
Bovey Tracey in Devonshire. The Russian localities for tourmaline 
are mentioned under Rubellite. Most of the tourmaline cut for 
jewelry comes from the gem-gravels^ of Ceylon. The green tour- 
maline has generally a yellowish or olive-green colour, andis known 
as " Ceylon chrysolite." Fine green crystals are found in Brazil, 
notably in the topaz-locality of Minas Novas; and when of vivid 
colour they have been called " Brazilian emeralds." Green tour- 
maline is a favourite ecclesiastical stone in South America Blue 
tourmaline occurs with the green; this variety is found also at Uto" 
in Sweden (its original locality) and notably near JHazaribagh in 
Bengal. Certain kinds of mica occasionally contain flat crystals 
of tourmaline between the cleavage-planes. 

Many localities in the United States are famous for tourmaline. 
Magnificent specimens have been obtained from^ Mt Mica, near 
Pans, Maine, where the mineral was accidentally discovered in 1820 
by two students, E. L. Hamlin and E. Holmes. It occurs in granite, 
with lepidolite, smoky quartz, spodumene, &c; and some of the' 
prismatic crystals are notable for being red at one end and 
green at the other. Mt Rubellite at Hebron, and Mt Apatite at 
Auburn, are other localities in Maine which have yielded fine tour- 
maline. At Chesterfield, Massachusetts, remarkable crystals occur, 
some of which show on transverse section a triangular nucleus of 



red tourmaline^ surrounded by a shell of green. Red and green 
tourmalines, with lepidolite and kunzite, are found in San Diego 
county, California. Fine coloured tourmalines occur at Haddam 
Neck, Connecticut; and excellent crystals of black tourmaline are 
well known from Pierrepont, New York, whilst remarkable brown 
crystals occur in limestone at Gouverneur in the same state. Canada 
is rich in tourmaline, notably at Burgess in Lanark county, Ontario, 
and at Grand Calumet Island in the Ottawa river. Heemsldrk 
Mountain, Tasmania, and Kangaroo Island, South Australia, have 
yielded fine coloured tourmaline fit for jewelry. Madagascar is 
a well-known locality for black tourmaline in large crystals. 

Many varieties of tourmaline have received distinctive names, 
some of which are noticed above. Drayite is G. Tschermak's name 
for a brown tourmaline, rich in magnesia but with little iron, occur- 
ring near Unter Drauburg in the Drave district in Carinthia. Taltalite 
was a name given by I. Domeyko to a mixture of tourmaline and 
copper ore from Taltal in Chile. The colourless Elba tourmaline 
was called apyrite by J. F. L ; Hausmann, in allusion to its refractory 
behaviour before the blow-pipe; whilst a black iron-tourmaline from 
Norway was termed aphrazite by J. B. d'Andrada, in consequence 
of its intumescence when heated. (F. W. R. *)

undergone many sieges and was sacked at various epochs by 
the Vandals, Normans, French and Spaniards, it preserves 
many monuments of its ancient days. Among these is the 
cathedral of Notre-Dame, one "of the finest and best preserved 
Romanesque and Gothic examples in Belgium (for plan, &c, 
sec Architecture: Romanesque and Gothic in Belgium). Its 
foundation dates from the year 1030, while the nave is Roman- 
esque of the middle of the 12th century, with much pointed 
work. The transept was added in the 13th century. The first 
choir was burned down in 1213, but was rebuilt in 1242 at 
the same time as the transept, and is a superb specimen 
of pointed Gothic. There are five towers with spires, which 
give the outside an impressive appearance, and much has been 
done towards removing the squalid buildings that formerly con- 
cealed the cathedral. There are several old pictures of merit, 
and the shrine of St Eleuthere, the first bishop of Tournai 
in the 6th century, is a remarkable product of the silversmith's 
art . The belfry on the Grand Place was built in 1187, 
partly reconstructed in 1391 and finally restored and endowed 
with a steeple in 1852. The best view of the cathedral can 
be obtained from its gallery. The church of St Quentin in 
the same square as the belfry is almost as ancient as Notre- 
Dame, and the people of Tournai call it the " little cathedral." 
In the church of St Brice is the tomb of Childeric discovered 
in 1655. Among the relics were three hundred small golden 
models of bees. These were removed to Paris, and when 
Napoleon was crowned emperor a century and a half later he 
chose Childeric's bees for the decoration of his coronation 
mantle. In this manner the bee became associated with the 
Napoleonic legend just as the lilies were with the Bourbons. 
The Pont des Trous over the Scheldt, with towers at each end, 
was built in 1290, and among many other interesting buildings 
there are some old houses still in occupation which date 
back to the 13th century. On the Grand Place is the 
fine statue of Christine de Lalaing, princess d'Epinoy, who 
defended Tournai against Parma in 1581. Tournai carries 
on a large trade in carpets (called Brussels), bonnet shapes, 
corsets and fancy goods generally. With regard to the carpet 
manufactory, it is said locally to date from the time of the 
Crusades, and it is presumed that the Crusaders learnt the 
art from the Saracens. 

The history of Tournai dates from the time of Julius Caesar, 
when it was called civitas Nerviorum or castrum Turnacum. In the 
reign of Augustus, Agrippa fixed, the newly mixed colony of Suevi 
and Menapii at Tournai, which continued throughout the period 
of Roman occupation to be of importance. In the 5th century 
the Franks seized Tournai, and Merovaeus made it the capital 
of his dynasty. This it remained until the subdivision of the 
Frank monarchy among the sons of Clovis. When feudal 
possessions, instead of being purely personal, were vested in the 
families of the holder after the death of Charlemagne, Tournai 
was specially assigned to Baldwin of the Iron Arm by Charles

the Bald, whose daughter Judith he had abducted, on receiving 
the hereditary title of count of Flanders. During the Bur- 
gundian period it was the residence of Margaret of York, widow 
of Charles the Bold; and the pretender Perkin Warbeck, whom 
she championed, if not horn there, was the reputed son of a 
Jew of Tournai. In the early 16th century Tournai was an 
English possession for a few years and Henry VIII. sold it to 
Francis I. It did not long remain French, for in 1521 the 
count of Nassau, Charles V.'s general, took it and added it to 
the Spanish provinces. During the whole of the middle ages 
Tournai was styled the " seigneurie de Tournaisis," and pos- 
sessed a charter and special privileges of its own. Near Tournai 
was fought, jon the nth of May 1745, the famous hattle 
of Fontenoy. (D. C. B.) 

TOURNAMENT, or Tourney (Fr. tournement, tournoi, Med. 
Lat. torneamenhtMy from tourner y to turn), the name popularly 
given in the middle ages to a species of mock fight, so called 
owing to the rapid turning of the horses (Skeat). Of the several 
medieval definitions of the tournament given hy Du Cange 
(Glossarium, s.v. " Tourneamentum "), the best is that of Roger 
of Hoveden, who described tournaments as " military exercises 
carried out, not in the spirit of hostility (nullo interveniente 
odio), but solely for practice and the display of prowess (pro solo 
exercitio, atque ostentatione virium)." Men who carry weapons 
have in all ages played at the game of war in time of peace. 
But the tournament, properly so called, does not appear in 
Europe before the nth century, in spite of those elaborate 
fictions of Ruexner's Thurnierbuch which detail the tournament 
laws of Henry the Fowler. More than one chronicler records 
the violent death, in 1066, of a French baron named Geoflroi de 
Preulli, who, according to the testimony of his contemporaries, 
" invented tournaments." In England, at least, the tourna- 
ment was counted a French fashion, Matthew Paris calling it 
conflictus gallicus. 

By the 12th century the tournament had grown so popular 
in England that Henry II. found it necessary to forbid the 
sport which gathered in one place so many barons and knights 
in arms. In that age we have the famous description by William 
FitzStephen of the martial games of the Londoners in Smith- 
field. He tells how on Sundays in Lent a noble train of young 
men would take the field well mounted, rushing out of the city 
with spear and shield to ape the feats of war. Divided into parties, 
one body would retreat, while another pursued striving to un- 
horse them. The younger lads, he says, bore javelins disarmed 
of their steel, by which we may know that the weapon of the 
elders was the headed lance. William of Newbury tells us how 
the young knights, balked of their favourite sport by the royal 
mandate, would pass over sea to win glory in foreign b'sts. 
Richard I. relaxed his father's order, granting licences for 
tournaments, and Jocelin of Brakelond has a long story of the 
great company of cavaliers who held a tournament between 
Thetford and Bury St Edmunds in defiance of the abhot. From 
that time onward unlicensed tourneying was treated as an 
offence against the Crown, which exacted heavy fees from all 
taking part in them even when a licence had been obtained. 
Often the licence was withheld, as in 1255, when the king's son's 
grave peril in Gascony is alleged as a reason for forbidding a 
meeting. In 1299 life and limb were declared to be forfeit in 
the case of those who should arrange a tourney without the royal 
licence, and offenders were to be seized with horse and harness. 
As the tournament became an occasion for pageantry and 
feasting, new reason was given for restraint: a simple knight 
might beggar himself over a sport which risked costly horses 
and carried him far afield. Jousters travelled from land to land, 
like modern cricketers on their tours, offering and accepting 
challenges. Thus Edward I., hefore coming to the throne, led 
eighty knights to a tournament on the Continent. Before the 
jousts at Windsor on St George's Day in r344 heralds published 
in France, Scotland, Burgundy, Hainault, Flanders, Brabant 
and the domains of the emperor the king's offer of safe conduct 
for competitors. At the weddings of princes and magnates and 
at the crowning of kings the knights gathered to the joustings, 



which had become as much a part of such high ceremonies 
as the banquet and the minstrelsy. The fabled glories of the 
Round Tahle were revived by princely hosts, who would assemble 
a gallant company to keep open house and hold the field against 
all comers, as did Mortimer, the queen's lover, when, on the eve 
of his fall, he hrought all the chivalry of the land to the place 
where he held his Round Table. About 1292 the " Statute of 
Arms for Tournaments " laid down, " at the request of the earls 
and barons and of the knighthood of England," new laws for 
the game. Swords with points were not to he used, nor pointed 
daggers, nor club nor mace. None was to raise up a fallen 
knight but his own appointed squires, clad in his device. The 
squire who offended was to lose horse and arms and lie three 
years in gaol. A northern football crowd would understand 
the rule that forbade those coming to see the tournament to 
wear harness or arm themselves with weapons. Disputes were 
to be settled by a court of honour of princes and earls. That 
such rules were needful had been shown at Rochester in 1251, 
where the foreign knights were beaten by the English and so 
roughly handled that they fled to the city for refuge. On their 
way the strangers were faced hy another company of knights 
who handled them roughly and spoiled them, thrashing them 
with staves in revenge for the doings at a Brackley tournament. 
Even as early as the 13th century some of these tournaments 
were mere pageants of horsemen. For the Jousts of Peace held 
at Windsor Park in 1278 the sword-hlades are of whalebone and 
parchment, silvered; the helms are of boiled leather and the 
shields of tight timber. But the game could make rough sport. 
Many a tournament had its tale of killed and wounded in the 
chronicle books. We read how Roger of Lemburn struck 
Arnold de Montigny dead with a lance thrust under the helm. 
The first of the Montagu earls of Salisbury died of hurts taken 
at a Windsor jousting, and in those same lists at Windsor the 
earl's grandson Sir William Montagu was killed hy his own 
father. William Longespee in 1256 was so bruised that he never 
recovered his strength, and he .is among many of whom the like 
is written. Blunted or " rebated " lance-points came early 
into use, and by the 14th century the coronall or cronell head 
was often fitted in place of the point. After 1400 the armourers 
began to devise harness with defences specially wrought for ser- 
vice in the lists. But the joust lost its chief perils with the 
invention of the tilt, which, as its name imports, was at first a 
cloth stretched along the length of the lists. The cloth became 
a stout barrier of timber, and in the early 16th century the 
knight ran his course at little risk. Locked up in steel harness, 
reinforced with the grand-guard and the other jousting pieces, 
he charged along one side of this barrier, seeing little more through 
the pierced sight-holes of the helm than the head and shoulders 
of his adversary. His bridle arm was on the tilt-side, and thus 
the blunted lance struck at an angle upon the polished plates. 
Mishaps might befall. Henry II. of France died from the stroke 
of Gabriel de Montgomeri, who failed to cast up in time the 
truncheon of his splintered lance. But the 16th-century tourna- 
ment was, in the main, a bloodless meeting. 

The 15th century had seen the mingling of the tournament 
and the pageant. Adventurous knights would travel far afield 
in time of peace to gain worship in conflicts that perilled life 
and limh, as when the Bastard of Burgundy met the Lord Scales 
in 1466 in West Smithfield under the fair and costly galleries 
crowded with English dames. On the first day the two ran 
courses with sharp spears; on the second day they tourneyed 
on horseback, sword in hand; on the third day they met on foot 
with heavy pole-axes. But the great tournament held in the 
market-place of Bruges, when the jousting of the Knights of the 
Fleece was part of the pageant of the Golden Tree, the Giant 
and the Dwarf, may stand as a magnificent example of many 
such gay gatherings. When Henry VIII. was scattering his 
father's treasure the pageant had become an elaborate masque. 
For two days after the crowning of the king at Westminster, 
Henry and his queen viewed from the galleries of a fantastic 
palace set up beside the tilt-yard a play in which deer were pulled 
down by greyhounds in a paled park, in which the Lady Diana 



io6

and the Lady Pallas came forward, embowered in moving castles, 
to present the champions. Such costly shows fell out of fashion 
after the death of Henry VIII.; and in England the tournament 
remained, until the end, a martial sport. Sir Henry Lee rode 
as Queen Elizabeth's champion in the tilt-yard of Whitehall 
until his years forced him to surrender the gallant office to that 
earl of Cumberland who wore the Queen's glove pinned to the 
flap of his hat. But in France the tournament lingered on until 
it degenerated to the carrousel, which, originally a horseman's 
game in which cavaliers pelted each other with balls, became an 
unmartial display when the French king and his courtiers 
pranced in such array as the wardrobe-master of the court 
ballets would devise for the lords of Ind and Africk. 

The tournament was, from the first, held to be a sport for men 
of noble birth, and on the Continent, where nobility was more 
exactly defined than in England, the lists were jealously closed 
to all combatants but those of the privileged class. In the 
German lands, questions as to the purity of the strain of a candi- 
date for admission to a noble chapter are often settled by appeal 
to the fact that this or that ancestor had taken part in a tourna- 
ment. Konrad Griinenberg's famous heraldic manuscript 
shows us the Helmschau that came before the German tournament 
of the 15th century — the squires carrying each his master's 
crested helm, and a little scutcheon of arms hanging from it, 
to the hall where the king of arms stands among the ladies and, 
wand in hand, judges each blazon. In England several of those 
few rolls of arms which have come down to us from the middle 
ages record the shields displayed at certain tournaments. 
Among the illustrations of the article Heraldry will be 
seen a leaf of a roll of arms of French and English jousters at 
the Field of the Cloth of Gold, and this leaf is remarkable 
as illustrating also the system of " checques " for noting the 
points scored by the champions. (O. Ba.) 

TOURNEFORT/ JOSEPH PITTON DE (1656-1708), French 
botanist, was born at Aix, in Provence, on the 5th of June 1656. 
He studied in the convent of the Jesuits at Aix, and was destined 
for the Church, but the death of his father left him free to 
follow his botanical inclinations. After two years' collecting, 
he studied medicine at Montpellier, but was appointed pro- 
fessor of botany at the Jardin des Plantes in 1683. By the king's 
order he travelled through western Europe, where he made 
extensive collections, and subsequently spent three years in 
Greece and Asia Minor (1700-1702). Of this journey a de- 
scription in a series of letters was posthumously published in 
3 vols. {Relation d'un voyage du Levant, Lyons, 17 17). His 
principal work is entitled Institutiones ret herbariae (3 vols. 
Paris, 1700), and upon this rests chiefly his claims to remem- 
brance as one of the most eminent of the systematic botanists 
who prepared the way for Linnaeus. He died on the 28th of 
December 1708. 

TOURNEUR, CYRIL (c. 1 575-1626), English dramatist, was 
perhaps the son of Captain Richard Turner, water-bailiff and 
subsequently lieutenant-governor of Brill in the Netherlands. 
Cyril Tourneur also served in the Low Countries, for in 1633 
there is a record made of payment to him for carrying letters 
to Brussels. He enjoyed a pension from the government 
of the United Provinces, possibly by way of compensation 
for a post held before Brill was handed over to the Dutch 
in 1616. In 1625 he was appointed by Sir Edward Cecil, whose 
father had been a former governor of Brill, to be secretary 
to the council of war. This appointment was cancelled by 
Buckingham, but Tourneur sailed in Cecil's company to Cadiz. 
On the return voyage from the disastrous expedition he was 
put ashore at Kinsale with other sick men, and died in Ireland 
on the 28th of February 1626. (M.Br.) 

An allegorical poem, worthless as art and incomprehensible 
as allegory, is his earliest extant work; an elegy on the death 
of Prince Henry, son of James I., is the latest. The two 
plays on which his fame rests, and on which it will rest for 
ever, were published respectively in 1607 and 161 1, but all 
students have agreed to accept the internal evidence which 
assures us that the later in date of publication must be the 



earlier in date of composition. His only other known work 
is an epicede on Sir Francis Vere, of no great merit as poetry, 
but of some value as conveying in a straightforward and mascu- 
line style the poet's ideal conception of a perfect knight' or 
" happy warrior," comparable by those who may think fit to 
compare it with the more nobly realized ideals of Chaucer 
and of Wordsworth. But if Tourneur had left on record no 
more memorable evidence of his powers than might be ? upplied 
by the survival of his elegies, he could certainly have claimed 
no higher place among English writers than is now occupied 
by the Rev. Charles Fitzgeoffrey, whose voluminous and fer- 
vent elegy on Sir Francis Drake is indeed of more actual value, 
historic or poetic, than either or than both of Tourneur's elegiac 
rhapsodies. The singular power, the singular originality and 
the singular limitation of his genius are all equally obvious 
in The Atheist's Tragedy, a dramatic poem no less crude and 
puerile and violent in action and evolution than simple and noble 
and natural in expression and in style. The executive faculty of 
the author is in the metrical parts of his first play so imperfect 
as to suggest either incompetence or perversity in the workman; 
in The Revenger's Tragedy it is so magnificent, so simple, im- 
peccable and sublime that the finest passages of this play 
can be compared only with the noblest examples of tragic 
dialogue or monologue now extant in English or in Greek. 
There is no trace of imitation or derivation from an alien source 
in the genius of this poet. The first editor of Webster has observed 
how often he imitates Shakespeare; and, in fact, essentially 
and radically independent as is Webster's genius also, the 
sovereign influence of his master may be traced not only in the 
general tone of his style, the general scheme of his composition, 
but now and then in a direct and never an unworthy or imper- 
fect echo of Shakespeare's very phrase and accent. But the 
resemblance between the tragic verse of Tourneur and the 
tragic verse of Shakespeare is simply such as proves the natural 
affinity between two great dramatic poets, whose inspiration 
partakes now and then of the quality more proper to epic 
or to lyric poetry. The fiery impulse, the rolling music, the 
vivid illustration of thought by jets of insuppressible passion, 
the perpetual sustenance of passion by the implacable persist- 
ency of thought, which we recognise as the dominant and 
distinctive qualities of such poetry as finds vent in the utter- 
ances of Hamlet or of Timon, we recognise also in the scarcely 
less magnificent poetry, the scarcely less fiery sarcasm, with 
which Tourneur has informed the part of Vindice — a harder- 
headed Hamlet, a saner and more practically savage and serious 
Timon. He was a satirist as passionate as Juvenal or Swift, 
but with a finer faith in goodness, a purer hope in its ultimate 
security of triumph. This fervent constancy of spirit relieves 
the lurid gloom and widens the limited range of a tragic imagina- 
tion which otherwise might be felt as oppressive rather than 
inspiriting. His grim and trenchant humour is as peculiar in 
its sardonic passion as his eloquence is original in the strenuous 
music of its cadences, in the roll of its rhythmic thunder. 
As a playwright, his method was almost crude and rude in 
the headlong straightforwardness of its energetic simplicity; 
as an artist in character, his interest was intense but narrow, 
his power magnificent but confined; as a dramatic poet, the 
force of his genius is great enough to ensure him an enduring 
place among the foremost of the followers of Shakespeare.

TOURNEUX, JEAN MAURICE (1849- ), French man 
of letters and bibliographer, son of the artist and author J. F. E. 
Tourneux, was born in Paris on the 12th of July 1849. 
He began his career as a bibliographer by collaborating in 
new editions of the Supercheries litUraires of Joseph Querard 
and the Dictionnaire des anonymes of Antoine Barbier. His 
most important bibliographical work was the Bibliographic de 
Vhisloire de Paris pendant la revolution franqaise (3 vols. 1890- 
1901), which was crowned by the Academy of Inscriptions. 
This valuable work serves as a guide for the history of the 
city beyond the limits of the Revolution. 

His other works include bibliographies of Prosper Merimee (1876), 
of Th6ophile Gautier (1876), of the brothers deGoncourt (1897) and 
others; also editions of F. M. Grimm's Correspondance litttraire, 
of Diderot's Neveu de Rameau (1884), of Montesquieu's Lettres 
persanes (1886), &c. 

TOURNON, a town of south-western France, capital of an 
arrondissement in the department of Ardeche, on the right bank 
of the Rhone, 58 m. S. of Lyons by rail. Pop. (1906), town, 
3642; commune, 5003. Tournon preserves a gateway of the 
15th century and other remains of fortifications and an old 
castle used as town hall, court-house and prison and con- 
taining a Gothic chapel. The church of St Julian dates chiefly 
from the 14th century. The lycee occupies an old college 
founded in the 16th century by Cardinal Francois de Tournon. 
Of the two suspension bridges which unite the town with Tain 
on the left bank of the river, one was built in 1825 and is the 
oldest in France. A statue to General Rampon (d. 1843) 
stands in the Place Carnot. Wood-sawing, silk-spinning, and 
the manufacture of chemical manures, silk goods and hosiery 
are carried on in the town, which has trade in the wine of 
the Rhone hills. Tournon had its own counts as early as 
the reign of Louis I. In the middle of the 17 th century the title 
passed from them to the dukes of Ventadour. 

TOURNUS, a town of east-central France, in the depart- 
ment of Sa6ne-et-Loire, on the right bank of the Sa6ne, 20 m. 
N. by E. of Macon on the Paris-Lyons railway. Pop. (1906), 
3787. The church of St Philibert (early nth century) once 
belonging to the Benedictine abbey of Tournus, suppressed in 
1785, is in the Burgundian Romanesque style. The facade lacks 
one of the two flanking towers originally designed for it. The 
nave is roofed with barrel vaulting, supported on tall cylin- 
drical columns. The choir beneath which is a crypt of the nth 
century has a deambulatory and square chapels. In the Place 
de l'H6tel de Ville stands a statue of J. B. Greuze, born in the 
town in 1725. There are vineyards in the surrounding dis- 
trict and the town and its port have considerable commerce in 
wine and in stone from" the neighbouring quarries. Chair- 
making is an important industry. 

TOURS, a town of central France, capital of the department 
of Indre-et-Loire, 145 m. S.W. of Paris by rail. Pop. (1906), 
town 61,507; commune, 67,601. Tours lies on the left bank of 
the Loire on a flat tongue of land between that river and the 
Cher a little above their junction. The right bank of the 



Loire is bordered by hills at the foot of which lie the suburbs 
of St Cyr and St Symphorien. The river is crossed by two 
suspension bridges, partly built on islands in the river, and by 
a stone bridge of the second half of the 18th century, the Pont 
de Tours. Many foreigners, especially English, live at or visit 
Tours, attracted by the town itself, its mild climate and situa- 
tion in " the garden of France," and the historic chateaux in 
the vicinity. The Boulevard Beranger, with its continuation, 
the Boulevard Heurteloup, traverses Tours from west to east 
dividing it into two parts; the old town to the north, with its 
narrow streets and ancient houses, contains the principal 
buildings, the shops and the business houses, while the new 
town to the south, centring round a fine public garden, is almost 
entirely residential. The Rue Nationale, the widest and hand- 
somest street in Tours, is a prolongation of the Pont de Tours 
and runs at right angles to the boulevards, continuing under the 
name of the Avenue de Grammont until it reaches the Cher. 

St Gatien, the cathedral of Tours, though hardly among the 
greatest churches of France, is nevertheless of considerable 
interest. A cathedral of the first half of the 12th century was 
burnt in 1166 during the quarrel between Louis VII. of France 
and Henry II. of England. A new cathedral was begun about 
n 70 but not finished till 1547. The lower portions of the 
west towers belong to the 12th century, the choir to the 13th 
century; the transept and east bays of the nave to the 14th; 
the remaining bays, a cloister on the north, and the facade, 
profusely decorated in the Flamboyant style, to the 15th and 
1 6th centuries, the upper part of the towers being in the 
Renaissance style of the 16th century. In the interior there is 
fine stained glass, that of the choir (13th century) being espe- 
cially remarkable. The tomb of the children of Charles VIII., 
constructed in the first years of the 16th century and attributed 
to the brothers Juste is also of artistic interest. 

An example of Romanesque architecture survives in the great 
square tower of the church of St Julien, the rest of which is in the 
early Gothic style of the 13th century, with the exception of two 
apses added in the 16th century. Two towers and a Renaissance 
cloister are the chief remains of the celebrated basilica of St Martin 
built mainly during the 12th and 13th centuries and demolished 
in 1802. It stood on the site of an earlier and very famous church 
built from 466 to 472 by bishop St Perpetuus and destroyed together 
with many other churches in a fire in 998. Two other churches 
worthy of mention arc Notre-Dame la Riche, originally built in 
the 13th century, rebuilt in the 16th, and magnificently restored 
in the 19th century; and St Saturnin of the 15th century. The 
new basilica of St Martin and the church of St fitienne are modern. 
Of the old houses of Tours the hStcl Gouin and that wrongly 
known as the house of Tristan THermite (both of the 15th century) 
are the best known. Tours has several learned societies and a 
valuable library, including among its MSS. a gospel of the 8th century 
on which the kings of France took oath as honorary canons of the 
church of St Martin. The museum contains a collection of pictures, 
and the museum of the Archaeological Society of Touraine has 
valuable antiquities; there is also a natural history museum. 

The chief public monuments are the fountain of the Renaissance 
built by Jacques de Beaune (d. 1527X financial minister, the statues 
of Descartes, Rabelais and Balzac, the latter born at Tours, and a 
monument to the three doctors Bretonneau, Trousseau and Velpeau. 
Tours is the seat of an archbishop, a prefect, and a court of assizes, 
and headquarters of the IX. Army Corps and has tribunals of first 
instance and of commerce, a board of trade arbitration, a chamber 
of commerce and a branch of the Bank of France. Among its 
educational institutions are a preparatory school of medicine and 
pharmacy, lycees for both sexes, a training college for girls and schools 
of fine art and music. The industrial establishments of the town 
include silk^ factories and numerous important printing-works, 
steel works, ironsfoundries and factories for automobiles, machinery, 
Oil, lime and cement, biscuits, portable buildings, stained glass, 
boots and shoes and porcelain. A considerable trade is carried on 
in the wine of the district and in brandy and in dried fruits, sausages 
and confectionery, for which the town is well known. Three-quarters 
of a mile to the south-west of Tours lie unimportant remains of 
Plessis-les-Tours, the chateau built by Louis XI., whither he retired 
before his death in 1483. On the right bank of the Loire 2 m. 
above the town are the ruins of the ancient and powerful abbey of 
Marmoutier. Five miles to the north-west is the large agricultural 
reformatory of Mettray founded in 1839. 

Tours (see Touraine), under the Gauls the capital of the 
Turones or Turons, originally stood on the right bank of the 
Loire, a little above the present village of St Symphorien. At

TOURVILLE, COMTE DE 



first called Altionos, the town was afterwards known as Caesaro- 
dunum. The Romans removed the town from the hill where it 
originally stood to the plain on the left bank of the river. 
Behind the present cathedral, remains of the amphitheatre 
(443 ft. in length by 394 in breadth) built towards the end of the 
2nd century might formerly be seen. Tours became Christian 
about 250 through the preaching of Gatien, who founded the 
bishopric. The first cathedral was built a hundred years later by 
StLitorius. The bishopricbecameanarchbishopricwhen Gratian 
made Tours the capital of Lugdunensis Tertia though ' the 
bishops did not adopt the title of archbishop till the 9th 
century. Abput the beginning of the 5th century the official 
name of Caesarodunum was changed for that* of Civitas Turo- 
norum. St Martin, the great apostle of the Gauls, was bishop of 
Tours in the 4th century, and he was buried in a suburb which 
soon became as important as the town itself from the number of 
pilgrims who flocked to his tomb. Towards the end of the 4th 
century, apprehensive of barbarian invasion, the inhabitants 
pulled down some of their earlier buildings in order to raise a 
fortified wall, the course of which can still be traced in places. 
Their advanced fort of Larcay still overlooks the valley of the 
Cher. Affiliated to the Armorican confederation in 435, the 
town did not fall to the Visigoths till 473, and the new masters 
were always hated. It became part of the Frankish dominions 
under Clovis, who, in consideration of the help afforded by St 
Martin, presented the church with rich gifts out of the spoils 
taken frorn Alaric, confirmed and extended its right of sanc- 
tuary, and accepted for himself and his successors the title of 
canon of St Martin. At the end of the 6th century the bishopric 
was held by St Gregory of Tours. Tours grew rapidly in 
prosperity under the Merovingians, but abuse of the right of 
sanctuary led to great disorder, and the church itself became 
a hotbed of crime. Charlemagne re-established discipline in the 
disorganized monastery and set over it the learned Alcuin, 
who established at Tours one of the oldest public schools of 
Christian philosophy and theology. The arts flourished at 
Tours in the middle ages and the town was the centre of the 
Poitevin Romanesque school of architecture. The abbey was 
made into a collegiate church in the nth century, and was for a 
time affiliated to Cluny, but soon came under the direct rule of 
Rome, and for long had bishops of its own. The suburb in 
which the monastery was situated became as important as Tours 
itself under the name of Martinopolis. The Normans, attracted 
by its riches, pillaged it in 853 and 903. Strong walls were 
erected from 906 to 910, and the name was changed to that of 
Chateauneuf. Philip Augustus sanctioned the communal 
privileges which the inhabitants forced from the canons of 
St Martin and the innumerable offerings of princes, lords and 
pilgrims maintained the prosperity of the town all through the 
middle ages. A 13th-century writer speaks with enthusiasm 
of the wealth and luxury of the inhabitants of Chateauneuf, 
of the beauty and chastity of the women and of the rich shrine 
of the saint. In the 14th century Tours was united to Chateau- 
neuf within a common wall, of- which a round tower, the Tour 
de Guise, remains, and both towns were put under the same 
administration. The numerous and long-continued visits of 
Charles VII., Louis XI., who established the silk-industry, and 
Charles VIII. during the 15th century favoured the commerce 
and industry of the town, then peopled by 75,000 inhabitants. 
In the 15th and 16th centuries the presence of Jean Fouquet 
the painter of Michel Colomb and the brothers Juste the sculp- 
tors, enhanced the fame of the town in the sphere of art. In 
1562 Tours suffered from the violence of both Protestants and 
Catholics, and enjoyed no real security till after the pact entered 
into at Plessis-les-Tours between Henry III. and Henry of 
Navarre in 1589. In the 17th and 18th centuries Tours was the 
capital of the government of Touraine. Its manufactures, 
of which silk weaving was the chief, suffered from the revocation 
of the Edict of Nantes (1685). In 1772 its mint, whence were 
issued the " livres " of Tours [librae Turonenses) was suppressed. 
During the Revolution the town formed a base of operations of 
the Republicans against the Vendeans. In 1870 it was for a 



time the seat of the delegation of the government of national 
defence. In 1871 it was occupied by the Germans from the 
10th of January to the 8th of March.

TOURVILLE, ANNE-HILARION DE COTENTIN (or Cos- 

tantin), Comte de (1642-1701), French admiral and marshal 
of France, was the son of Cesar de Cotentin, or Costantin, who 
held offices in the household of the king and of the prince of 
Conde. He is said to have been born at Tourville in Normandy, 
but was baptized in Paris on the 24th of November 1642, was 
commonly known as M. de Tourville, and was destined by his 
family to enter the Order of Malta. From the age of fourteen 
to the age of twenty-five, he served with the galleys of the Order. 
At that time the knights were still fighting the Barbary pirates 
of Algiers and Tunis. The young Anne-Hilarion is said to have 
been distinguished for courage. His life during these years, 
however, is little known. The supposed Memoirs bearing his 
name were published by the Abbe de Magron in the 18th century 
and belong to the large class of historical romances which pro- 
fessed to be biographies or autobiographies. In 1667 he was 
back in France, and was incorporated in the corps of officers of 
the French Royal navy which Louis XIV. was 'then raising from 
the prostration into which it had fallen during his minority. 
The positions of French naval officer and knight of Malta were 
not incompatible. Many men held both. The usual practice 
was that they did not take the full vows till they were in middle 
life, and had reached the age when they were entitled to hold 
one of the great offices. Until then they were free to marry, 
on condition of renouncing all claim to the chief places. As 
Anne-Hilarion de Cotentin married a wealthy widow, the 
marquise de Popeliniere, in 1689 at which time he was made 
count of Tourville, he severed his connexion with the Order. 
Nor does he appear to have served with it at all after his return 
to France in 1667. He was at first employed in cruising against 
the Barbary pirates and the Turks. In the expedition sent 
against Crete in 1668-69 under command of the Due de Beau- 
fort he had command of the " Croissant " (44). The Due de 
Beaufort was killed, and the expedition was a failure. When 
the war with Holland in which France and England acted as 
allies began in 1670, Tourville commanded the " Page " (50), 
in the squadron of the comte d'Estrees (1624-1707) sent to 
co-operate with the duke of York. He was present at the battle 
of Solebay (June 7, 1672), and in the action on the coast of 
Holland in the following year, when Prince Rupert commanded 
the English fleet. When England withdrew from the alliance, 
the scene of the naval war was transferred to the Mediterranean, 
where Holland was co-operating with the Spaniards. Tourvillle 
served under Abraham Duquesne in his battles with De Ruyter. 
He particularly distinguished himself at the battle of Palermo 
on the 2nd of June 1676. By this time he was known as one of 
the best officers in the service of King Louis XIV. Unlike many 
employed by the king to command his ships in the earlier part 
of his reign, Tourville was a seaman. He had the reputation 
of being able to do all the work required in a ship, and he had 
made a study of naval warfare. The great treatise on naval 
tactics afterwards published under the name of his secretary, 
the Jesuit Hoste or THoste, was understood to have been 
inspired by him. In 1683 he was chef d'escadre — rear admiral — 
with Duquesne in operations against the Barbary pirates, and 
he continued on that service with D'Estrees. By 1689 he had 
been promoted lieutenant-general des armees navales, and was 
named vice-admiral du Levant or of the East. In June of 
that year he took up the commandership-in-chief of the French 
naval forces in the war against England and her continental allies 
which had begun in the previous year. From this time till 
the failure of his resources compelled King Louis XIV. to 
withdraw his fleets from the sea, Tourville continued to com- 
mand the naval war in the Channel and the Atlantic. His 
conduct and example during this period were the source of the 
system of manoeuvring to gain an advantage by some method

other than plain fighting. The personal character of Tourville 
must be held to account largely for the timidity of the principles 
he established. Tourville's personal valour was of the finest 
quality, but like many other brave men, he was nervous under 
the weight of responsibility. It is no less clear that anxiety 
to avoid risking a disaster to his reputation was of more weight 
with him than the wish to win a signal success. He belonged 
to the type of men in whose minds the evil which may happen is 
always more visible than the good. In 1690 he had an oppor- 
tunity which might well have tempted the most cautious, and 
he missed it out of sheer care to keep his fleet safe against all 
conceivable chances, aided perhaps by a pedantic taste for 
formal, orderly movement. He was opposed in the channel 
by the allies, who had only fifty-six ships, while his own force, 
though it included some vessels of no serious value, was from 
seventy to eighty sail strong. He was feebly attacked by 
Admiral Arthur Herbert, the newly created earl of Torrington, 
off Beachy Head on the 10th of July. The Dutch ships in the 
van were surrounded. The allies had to retreat in disorder, 
and Tourville followed in " line of battle " which limited his 
speed to that of his slowest ship. So his enemy escaped with 
comparatively little loss. In the following year he performed 
his famous " off shore cruise," in the Bay of Biscay. He moved 
to and fro in fine order avoiding being brought to battle, but 
also failing to inflict any harm on his opponent. In the mean- 
time the cause of King James II. was ruined in Ireland. In 
1692 the Mediterranean fleet having failed to join him, he was 
faced by a vastly superior force of the allies. The French 
king had prepared a military force to invade England, and 
Tourville was expected to prepare the way. Having at least 
a clear indication that he was expected to act with vigour, 
if not precise orders to fight against any odds, he made a 
resolute attack on the centre of the allies on the 29th of May off 
Cape Barfleur, and drew off before he was surrounded. This 
action which with the pursuit of the following days made up what 
is called the battle of La Hogue, from the Bay where some of 
the fugitive French ships were destroyed, or Barfleur, proved 
his readiness to face danger. But his inability to take and act 
on a painful decision was no less proved in the retreat. He 
hesitated to sacrifice his crippled flagship, and thereby detained 
his whole fleet. The result was that the " Soleil Royale " 
herself and fifteen other ships were cut off and destroyed at 
La Hogue. In 1693 he was again at sea with a great fleet, and 
had a chance to inflict extreme injury on the allies by the capture 
of the Smyrna convoy which included their whole Mediterranean 
trade for the year. He did it a great deal of harm outside the 
Straits of Gibraltar, but again he kept his fleet in battle order, 
and a large part of the convoy escaped. King Louis XIV. 
who had a strong personal regard for him, continued to treat 
him with favour. Tourville was made Marshal of France in 
1693, but the growing exhaustion of the French treasury no 
longer allowed the maintenance of great fleets at sea. Tour- 
ville remained generally at Toulon, and had no more fighting. 
He died in Paris in 1701. His only son, a colonel in the 
army, was killed at Denain in 171 2. 

The English account of the battles of Beachy Head and La Hogue 
will be found in Ledyard's Naval History. Troude's Batailles novates 
de la France gives the French version of these and the other actions 
in which Tourville was concerned. Tourville is frequently mentioned 
in the Life of Duquesne by M. Jal. (D. H.) 

TOUSSAINT L'OUVERTURE (or Louverture), PIERRE- 
DOMINIQUE (c. 1746-1803), one of the liberators of Haiti, 
claimed to be descended from an African chief, his father, a slave 
in Haiti, being the chief's second son. He was at first surnamed 
Breda, but this was afterwards changed to L'Ouverture in token of 
the results of his valour in causing a gap in the ranks of the 
enemy. From childhood he manifested unusual abilities 
and succeeded, by making the utmost use of every 
opportunity, in obtaining a remarkably good education. He 
obtained the special confidence of his master, and was made 
superintendent of the other negroes on the plantation. After 
the insurrection of 1791 he joined the insurgents, and, having 
acquired some knowledge of surgery and medicine, acted as 



physician to the forces. His rapid rise in influence aroused, 
however, the jealousy of Jean Francois, who caused his arrest 
on the ground of his partiality to the whites. He was liberated 
by the rival insurgent chief Baisson, and a partisan war ensued, 
but after the death of Baisson he placed himself under the orders 
of Jean Francois. Subsequently he joined the Spaniards, 
but, when the French government ratified the act declaring 
the freedom of the slaves, he came to the aid of the French. 
In 1796' he was named commander-in-chief of the armies of 
St Domingo, but, having raised and disciplined a powerful 
army of blacks, he made himself master of the wh'ole country, 
renounced the authority of France, and announced himself 
" the Buonaparte of St Domingo." He was taken prisoner by 
treachery on the part of France, and died in the prison of Joux, 
near Besancon, on the 27th of April 1803.

TOW, the term given in textile manufacture to the short 
fibres formed during the processes of scutching and hackling, 
and also to the yarns which are made from these fibres. A 
special machine termed a carding engine or a tow card is used 
to form these fibres into a sliver, this sliver then passes to the 
drawing frames, and thereafter follows the same process as line 
yarns in flax spinning. 

TOWANDA, a borough and the county-seat of Bradford 
county, Pennsylvania, U.S.A., on the west bank of the Susque- 
hanna river, about 50 m. N.W. of Wilkes-Barre. Pop. (1890), 
4169; (1900), 4663 (322 foreign-born); (1910) 4281. Towanda 
is served by the Lehigh Valley and the Susquehanna & New 
York railways. It is situated about 730 ft. above the sea, and 
is surrounded by high hills. Towanda contains the museum 
of the Bradford County Historical Society. The borough is 
in a farming, dairying and stock-raising region, and has various 
manufactures. The first settlement was made by William Means 
in 1786, the village was laid out in 181 2, became the county- 
seat in the same year, was variously known for some years 
as Meansville, Overton, Williamson, Monmouth and Towanda, 
and in 1828 was incorporated as the \jorough of Towanda. Its 
name is an Indian word said to mean " where we bury the 
dead." 

TOWCESTER, a market town in the southern parliamentary 
division of Northamptonshire, England, 8 m. S.S.W. of North- 
ampton, on the East & West Junction and the Northampton 
& Banbury Junction railways. Pop. (1901), 2371. It is 
pleasantly situated on the small river Tove, a left-bank affluent of 
the Ouse. The church of St Lawrence is a good Early English, 
Decorated and Perpendicular building, with a fine western 
Perpendicular tower. There are a considerable agricultural 
trade and a manufacture of boots and shoes. 

Here was a Roman town or village situated on Watling 
Street. The site has yielded a considerable number of relics. 
In the 10th century a fortress was maintained here against the 
invading Danes. The site of both this and the Roman station 
is marked by an artificial mound known as Burg Hill, not far 
from the church, above the river. Towcester, with the whole 
of this district, witnessed a large part of the operations during 
the Civil War of the 17th century. 

TOWEL, a cloth used for the purpose of drying the hands, 
face or body after bathing or washing. These cloths are made 
of different materials, known as " towellings," the two principal 
kinds are " huckaback," a slightly roughened material for 
chamber towels for face and hands, and Turkish towelling, 
with a much rougher surface, for bath towels; finer towellings 
are made of linen or damask. The term has a particular eccle- 
siastical usage as applied to a linen altar- cloth or to a rich cloth 
of embroidered silk, velvet, &c, covering the altar at all " such 
periods when Mass is not being celebrated." 

The Mid. Eng. towaille comes through the O. Fr. touaiUe 
from the Low Lat. toacula f represented in other Romanic languages 
by Sp. toalla, Ital. tovaglia; this is to be referred to the Teutonic 
verb meaning " to wash," O. H. G. tovahan, M. H. G. dwahen, O. Eng.

TOWER— TOWER OF LONDON 



TOWER (Lat. turris; Fr. tour, docker; Ital. lorre; Ger. 
Thurm), the term given to a lofty building originally designed for 
defence, and, as such, attached to and forming part of the 
fortifications of a city or castle. Towers do not seem to have 
existed in Egypt, but in Mesopotamia from the earliest times 
they form the most important feature in the city walls, and are 
shown in the bas-reliefs of the Assyrian palaces at Nimroud 
and elsewhere. The earliest representation is perhaps* that 
engraved on the tablet in the lap of Gudea the priest king of 
Lagash (2700 B.C.), whose statue, found at Tello, is now in the 
Louvre; the drawing is that of a large fortified enclosure, with 
gates, bastions and towers, corresponding with remains of 
similar structures of the same and later periods. In the dis- 
coveries made here, at Susa and at Dom Sargoukin, the towers 
were about 40 ft. square, projecting from 16 to 20 ft. in front 
of the curtain walls which connected them, and standing about 
80 ft. apart. In Roman and Byzantine times this distance 
was increased, owing probably to the greater speed of pro- 
jectiles, and in the wall built by Theodosius at Constantinople 
the towers were 150 ft. apart (see also Castle and Fortifi- 
cation). 

From the architectural point of view, the towers which are 
of chief interest are those of ecclesiastical and secular buildings, 
those in Italy being nearly always isolated and known as cam- 
panili (see Campanile). In England the earliest known are the 
Anglo-Saxon towers, the best examples of which are those at 
Earl's Barton,Monkwearmouth, Barnack, Barton-on-Humber and 
Sompting; they were nearly always square on plan and situated 
at the west end, in an axial line with the nave, their chief 
characteristics being the long-and-short work of the masonry 
at the quoins, the decoration of the wall with thin pilaster strips, 
and the slight setting back of the storeys as they rose. There 
are a few examples of central Anglo-Saxon towers, . as at St 
Mary's, Dover; Breamore, Hants; and Dunham Major, Nor- 
folk; and, combined with western towers, at Ramsay and Ely; 
twin western towers existed at Exeter. Contemporary with 
these Saxon towers are many examples in France, but they are 
invariably central towers, as at Germigny-des-Pres and at 
Querqueville in Normandy; in Germany the twin towers of 
Aix-la-Chapelle are the best known. As a rule the single 
western tower is almost confined to England, prior to the end 
of the nth century, when there are many examples throughout 
Germany. In Norman times in England, central towers are 
more common, and the same obtains in France, where, however, 
they are sometimes carried to a great height, as at Perigueux, 
where the wall decoration consists of pilasters in tbe lower 
storeys, and semi-detached columns above, probably based on 
that of the Roman amphitheatre there: otherwise the design 
of the Romanesque church towers is extremely simple, de- 
pending for its effect on the good masonry and the enrichment 
of the belfry windows. In later periods flat buttresses are 
introduced, and these gradually assume more importance and 
present many varieties of design; greater apparent height 
is given to the tower by the string courses dividing the second 
storeys, and by rich blank arcading on them, the upper storey 
with the belfry windows forming always the most important 
feature of the tower. In those towers which are surmounted by 
spires (q.v.) the design of the latter possesses sometimes a greater 
interest both in England and France. A very large number 
of the towers of English cathedrals and churches have flat 
roofs enclosed with lofty battlemented parapets and numerous 
pinnacles and finials; in France such terminations are not 
found, and in Germany the high pitched roof is prevalent every 
where, so that the numerous examples in England have a special 
interest; sometimes the angle buttresses are grouped to carry 
octagonal pinnacles, and sometimes, as at Lincoln and Salis- 
bury, octagonal turrets rise from the base of the tower.' 

Among the finest examples are those of Canterbury, Ely, York, 
Gloucester, Lincoln and Worcester cathedrals; among churches, 
those of the minster at Beverley; St Mary's, St Neots (Huntingdon- 
shire) ; St Stephen's, Bristol, St Giles, Wrexham (Denbighshire — in 
many respects the most beautiful in England) ; St Mary Magdalene, 
Taunton; Magdalen College, Oxford, St Botolph, Boston, crowned 



with an octagonal tower; St Mary's, Ilminster (Somersetshire) and 
Malvern (Worcestershire) ; and the isolated towers at Chichester, 
Evesham and Bury St Edmund's. 

So far reference has been made only to central and western 
towers, the latter not always placed, like the Anglo-Saxon towers, 
in the axial line of the nave, but sometimes on the north or south 
side of the west end; and as a rule these are only found in Eng- 
land. In France and Germany, however, they are greatly 
increased in number; thus in Reims seven towers with spires 
were contemplated, according to Viollet-le-Duc, but never 
completed; at Chartres eight towers, and at Laon seven, of which 
six are completed; in Germany the cathedrals of Mayence and 
Spires and two of the churches in Cologne have from four to 
seven towers; and at Tournai cathedral, in Belgium, are seven 
towers. In many of the churches in Norfolk and Suffolk the 
western tower is circular, owing probably to the fact that, 
being built with stone of small dimensions, the angles of the 
quoins would have been difficult to construct. In some of the 
French towns, isolated towers were built to contain bells, and 
were looked upon as 'municipal constructions; of these there 
are a few left, as at Bethune, fivreux, Amiens and Bordeaux, 
the latter being a double tower, with the bells placed in a roof 
between them. 

The towers of secular buildings are chiefly of the town halls, of 
which there are numerous examples throughout France and Belgium, 
such as those of the h6tel de ville at St Antonin (13th century) 
and Compiegne, both in France; at Lubeck, Danzig and Munster 
in Germany; and Brussels, Bruges and Oudenarde in Belgium.

TOWER OF LONDON, THE, an ancient fortress on the east 
side of the City of London, England, on the north bank of 
the river Thames. On a slight elevation now called the Tower 
Hill, well protected by the river and its marshes, and by woods 
to the north, there was a British stronghold. Tradition, 
however, pointed to Julius Caesar as the founder of the 
Tower (Shakespeare, Richard III., 111., i; and elsewhere), 
and remains of Roman fortifications have been found beneath 
the present site. The Tower contains barracks, and is the 
repository of the regalia. It covers an irregular hexagonal area, 
and is surrounded by a ditch, formerly fed by the Thames, but 
now dry. Gardens surround it on the north and west, and an 
embankment borders the river on the south. Two lines of 
fortifications enclose the inner bail, in which is the magnificent 
White Tower or Keep, flanked by four turrets. This was built 
by Gundulf, bishop of Rochester, c. 1078. Its exterior was 
restored by Sir Christopher Wren, but within the Norman work 
is little altered. Here may be seen a collection of old armour 
and instruments of torture, the rooms said to have been Sir 
Walter Raleigh's prison, and the magnificent Norman chapel 
of St John. Among the surrounding buildings are the barracks, 
and the chapel of St Peter ad Vincula, dating from the early 
part of the 14th century, but much altered in Tudor times. 
The Ballium Wall, the inner of the two lines of fortification, 
is coeval with the keep. Twelve towers rise from it at 
intervals, in one of which, the Wakefield Tower, the Regalia or 
crown jewels are kept. The chief entry to the fortress is through 
the Middle Tower on the west, across the bridge over the moat, 
and through the Byward Tower. The Lion Gate under the Middle 
Tower took name from a menagerie kept here from Norman 
times until 1834. On the south, giving entry from the river 
through St Thomas Tower and the Bloody Tower, is the famous 
Traitor's Gate, by which prisoners of high rank were admitted. 
The chief historical interest of the Tower lies in its association 
with such prisoners. The Beauchamp Tower was for long the 
place of confinement, but dungeons and other chambers in 
various parts of the building are also associated with prisoners 
of fame. Executions took place both within the Tower and 
on Tower Hill. Many of those executed were buried in the chapel 
of St Peter ad Vincula, such as Sir Thomas More, Henry VIII.'s 
queens, Anne Boleyn and Katharine Howard, Lady Jane Grey 
and her husband Dudley, Sir Walter Raleigh, and the duke of 
Monmouth. The Tower was not only a prison from Norman 
times until the 19th century, but was a royal residence at

TOWN, in its most general sense, a collection or aggregation of 
inhabited houses larger than a village. The O. Eng. tun (M. Eng. 
toun) meant originally a fence or enclosure, cf. Ger. zaitn, hedge, 
hence an enclosed place. The Scottish and Northern English 
use of the word for a farmhouse and its buildings, a farmstead, 
preserves this original meaning, and is paralleled by the Icel. tun, 
homestead, dwelling-house. A cognate Celtic form meaning a 
fastness, a strong place, appears in Gael, and Irish dun, Welsh, 
din, fortress, hill-fort (cf. Welsh dinas, town). This is familiar 
from the many Latinized names of places, e.g. Lugdunum, 
A ugustodunum, &c. In English law " town " is not a word defined 
by statute. For purposes of local government there are boroughs, 
urban districts and rural districts, but many urban districts are 
rural in character and the distinction is purely an administrative 
one (see Borough; City; Commune (Medieval); Municipium; 
England: Local Government, and the sections on local adminis- 
tration under various country headings). The meaning attached 
to the term " township " in the local administration of the 
United States is treated under United States: Local Government. 

TOWNELEY (or Townley), CHARLES (1737-1805), English 
archaeologist and collector of marbles, was born at Towneley, 
the family seat, near Burnley in Lancashire, on the 1st of October 
1737. He was educated at the college of Douai, and subsequently 
under John Turberville Needham, the physiologist and divine. 
In 1758 he took up his residence at Towneley, where he lived the 
ordinary life of a country gentleman until about 1765, when he 
left England to study ancient art, chiefly at Rome. He also 
made several excursions to the south of Italy and Sicily. In 
conjunction with Gavin Hamilton, the artist, and Thomas 
Jenkins, a banker in Rome, he got together a splendid collection 
of antiquities, which was deposited in two houses bought 
by him for the purpose in Park Street, Westminster, where he 
died on the 3rd of January 1805. His solitary publication was 
an account of an ancient helmet found at Ribchester. His 
marbles, bronzes, coins, and gems were purchased by the British 
Museum for about £28,000, and form part of the Graeco-Roman 
collection. 

For an account of the antiquities see Sir Henry Ellis's The Townley 
Gallery (1836), and A. T. F. Michaelis's Ancient Marbles in Great 
Britain (1882). 

TOWNLEY, JAMES (1714-1778), English dramatist, second 
son of Charles Townley, merchant, was born in London on the 
6th of May 17 14. Educated at Merchant Taylors' School and at 
St John's College, Oxford, he took holy orders, being ordained 
priest on the 28th of May 1738. He was lecturer at St Dunstan's 
in the East, chaplain to the lord mayor, then under-master at 
Merchant Taylors' School until 1753, when he became grammar 
master at Christ's Hospital. In 1760 he became head master 
of Merchant Taylors' School, where in 1762 and 1763 he revived 
the custom of dramatic performances. He retained his head- 
mastership until his death on the 5th of July 1778. He took a 
keen interest in the theatre, and it has been asserted that many 
of David Garrick's best productions and revivals owed much 
to his assistance. He was the author, although the fact was 
long concealed, of High Life below Stairs, a two-act farce pre- 
sented at Drury Lane on the 31st of October 1750; also of False 
Concord (Covent Garden, March 20, 1764) and The Tutor (Drury 
Lane, Feb. 4, 1765). 

TOWNSHEND, CHARLES (1725-1767), English politician, 
was the second son of Charles, 3rd Viscount Townshend, who 
married Audrey (d. 1788), daughter and heiress of Edward 
Harrison of Ball's Park, near Hertford, a lady who rivalled her 
son in brilliancy of wit and frankness of expression. Charles was 
born on the 29th of August 1725, and was sent for his education 



to Leiden and Oxford. At the Dutch university, where he 
matriculated on the 27th of October 1745, he associated with a 
small knot of English youths, afterwards well known in various 
circles of life, among whom were Dowdeswell, his subsequent 
rival in politics, Wilkes, the witty and unprincipled reformer, and 
Alexander Carlyle, the genial Scotchman, who devotes some of 
the pages of his Autobiography to chronicling their sayings and 
their doings. He represented Great Yarmouth in parliament 
from 1747 to 1761, when he found a seat for the treasury borough 
of Harwich. Public attention was first drawn to his abilities 
in 1753, when he delivered a lively attack, as a younger son 
who might hope to promote his advancement by allying himself 
in marriage to a wealthy heiress, against Lord Hardwicke's 
marriage bill. Although this measure passed into law, he 
attained this object in August 1755 by marrying Caroline (d. 
1794), the eldest daughter of the 2nd duke of Argyll and the 
widow of Francis,-Lord Dalkeith, the eldest son of the 2nd duke 
of Buccleuch. In April 1754 Townshend was transformed from 
the position of a member of the board of trade, which he had held 
from 1 749, to that of a lord of the admiralty, but at the close of 
1755 his passionate attack against the policy of the ministry, an 
attack which shared in popular estimation with the scathing 
denunciations of Pitt, the supreme success of Single-Speech 
Hamilton, and the hopeless failure of Lord Chesterfield's illegiti- 
mate son, caused his resignation. In the administration which 
was formed in November 1756, and which was ruled by Pitt, 
the lucrative office of treasurer of the chamber was given to 
Townshend, and in the following spring he was summoned to 
the privy council. 

With the accession of the new monarch in 1760 this volatile 
politician transferred his attentions from Pitt to the young 
king's favourite, Bute, and when in 176 1, at the latter 's instance, 
several changes were made in the ministry, Townshend was 
promoted to the post of secretary-at-war. In this place he 
remained after the great commoner had withdrawn from the 
cabinet, but in December 1762 he threw it up. Bute, alarmed 
at the growth in numbers and in influence of his enemies, tried 
to buy back Townshend's co-operation by sundry tempting 
promises, and at last secured his object in March 1763 with the 
presidency of the board of trade. Wlien Bute retired and George 
Grenville accepted the cares of official life, the higher post of 
first lord of the admiralty fell to Townshend's lot, but with 
his usual impetuosity he presumed to designate one of his 
satellites, Sir William Burrell (1732-1796)^0 a place under him 
at the board, and the refusal to accept the nomination led 
to his exclusion from the new administration. While in 
opposition his mind was swayed to and fro with conflicting 
emotions of dislike to the head of the ministry and of desire 
to share in the spoils of office. The latter feeling ultimately 
triumphed; he condescended to accept in the dying days 
of Grenville's cabinet, and to retain through the " lutestring " 
administration of Lord Rockingham — " pretty summer 
wear," as Townshend styled it, " but it will never stand 
the winter " — the highly paid position of paymaster-general, 
refusing to identify himself more closely with its fortunes as 
chancellor of the exchequer. The position which he refused from 
the hands of Lord Rockingham he accepted from Pitt in August 
1 766, and a few weeks later his urgent appeals to the great minister 
for increased power were favourably answered, and he was 
admitted to the inner circle of the cabinet. The new chancellor 
proposed the continuance of the land tax at four shillings in the 
pound, while he held out hopes that it might be reduced next year 
to three shillings ; whereupon his predecessor, William Dowdeswell, 
by the aid of the landed gentlemen, carried a motion that the 
reduction should take effect at once. This defeat proved a 
great mortification to Lord Chatham x and in his irritation 
against Townshend for this blow, as well as for some acts of in- 
subordination, he meditated the removal of his showy colleague. 
Before this could be accomplished Chatham's mind became 
impaired, and Townshend, who was the most determined and 
influential of his colleagues, swayed the ministry as he liked, 
pledging himself to find a revenue in America with which to meet

the deficiency caused by the reduction in the land tax. His wife 
was created (August 1767) baroness of Greenwich, and his elder 
brother George, the 4th viscount, was made lord-lieutenant of 
Ireland. He himself delivered in the House of Commons many 
speeches unrivalled in parliamentary history for wit and reckless- 
ness; and one of them still lives in history as the " champagne 
speech." His last official act was to carry out his intention by 
passing through parliament resolutions, which even his colleagues 
deprecated in the cabinet, for taxing several articles, such as 
glass, paper and tea, on their importation into America, which he 
estimated would produce the insignificant sum of £40,000 for the 
English treasury, and which shrewder observers prophesied would 
lead to the loss of the American colonies. Soon after this event 
he died somewhat suddenly on the 4th of September 1767. 

The universal tribute of Townshend's colleagues allows him 
the possession of boundless wit and ready eloquence, set off by 
perfect melody of intonation, but marred by an unexampled lack 
of judgment and discretion. He shifted his ground in politics 
with every new moon, and the world fastened on him the nick- 
name, which he himself adopted in his " champagne " speech, of 
the weathercock. His official knowledge was considerable; and 
it would be unjust to his memory to ignore the praises of his 
contemporaries or his knowledge of his country's commercial 
interests. The House of Commons recognized in him its spoilt 
child, and Burke happily said that " he never thought, did or 
said anything " without judging its effect on his fellow members.

W. E. H. Lecky, History of England (1892); and Horace Walpole, 
Memoirs of the Reign of George III., edited by G. F. R. Barker (1894). 

TOWNSHEND, CHARLES TOWNSHEND, 2ND Viscount 
(1674-1738), English statesman, was the eldest son of Sir 
Horatio Townshend, Bart. (c. 1630-1687), a zealous supporter 
of Charles II., who was created Baron Townshend in 1661 and 
Viscount Townshend of Raynham in 1682. The old Norfolk 
family of Townshend, to which h^ belonged, is descended from 
Sir Roger Townshend (d. 1493) of Raynham, who acted as legal 
adviser to the Paston family, and was made a justice of the 
common pleas in 1484. His descendant, another Sir Roger 
Townshend (c. 1 543-1 590), had a son Sir John Townshend 
(1564-1603), a soldier, whose son, Sir Roger Townshend (1588- 
1637), was created a baronet in 1617. He was the father of Sir 
Horatio Townshend. 

Charles Townshend succeeded to tfie peerage in December 
1687, and was educated at Eton and King's College, Cambridge. 
He had Tory sympathies when he took his seat in the House of 
Lords, but his views changed, and he began to take an active 
part in politics as a Whig. For a few years after the accession 
of Queen Anne he remained without office, but in November 
1708 he was appointed captain of. the yeomen of the guard, 
having in the previous year been summoned to the privy council. 
He was ambassador extraordinary and plenipotentiary to the 
states-general from 1709 to 1711, taking part during these years 
in the negotiations which preceded the conclusion of the treaty 
of Utrecht. After his recall to England he was busily occupied 
in attacking the proceedings of the new Tory ministry. Towns- 
hend quickly won the favour of George I., and in September 
17 14, the new king selected him as secretary of state for the 
northern department. The policy of Townshend and his 
colleagues, after they had crushed the Jacobite rising of 171 5, 
both at home and abroad, was one of peace. The secretary 
disliked the interference of England in the war between Sweden 
and Denmark, and he promoted the conclusion of defensive 
alliances between England and the emperor and England and 
France. In spite of these successes the influence of the Whigs 
was gradually undermined by the intrigues of Charles Spencer, 
earl of Sunderland, and by the discontent of the Hanoverian 
favourites. In October 1716, Townshend's colleague, James 
Stanhope, afterwards ist Earl Stanhope, accompanied the king 
on his visit to Hanover, and while there he was seduced from his 
allegiance to his fellow ministers by Sunderland, George being 
led to believe that Townshend and his brother-in-law, Sir 
Robert Walpole, were caballing with the prince of Wales, their 



intention being that the prince should supplant his father on 
the throne. Consequently in December 1716 the secretary was 
dismissed and was made lord-lieutenant of Ireland, but he only 
retained this post until the following April. 

Early in 1720 a partial reconciliation took place between the 
parties of Stanhope and Townshend, and in June of this year 
the latter became president of the council, a post which he held 
until February 1721, when, after the death of Stanhope and the 
forced retirement of Sunderland, a result of the South Sea 
bubble, he was again appointed secretary of state for the 
northern department, with Walpole as first lord of the treasury 
and chancellor of the exchequer. The two remained in power 
during the remainder of the reign of George I., the chief domestic 
events of the time being the impeachment of Bishop Atterbury, 
the pardon and partial restoration of Lord Bolingbroke, and the 
troubles in Ireland caused by the patent permitting Wood to 
coin halfpence. Townshend secured the dismissal of his rival, 
John Carteret, afterwards Earl Granville, but soon differences 
arose between himself and Walpole, and he had some difficulty 
in steering a course through the troubled sea of European politics. 
Although disliking him, George II. retained him in office, but 
the predominance in the ministry passed gradually but surely 
from him to Walpole. Townshend could not brook this. So 
long, to use Walpole's witty remark, as the firm was Townshend 
and Walpole all went well with it, but when the positions were 
reversed jealousies arose between the partners. Serious differ- 
ences of opinion concerning the policy to be adopted towards 
Prussia and in foreign politics generally led to a final rupture 
in 1730. Failing, owing to Walpole's interference, in his efforts 
to procure the dismissal of a colleague and his replacement by 
a personal friend, Townshend retired on the 15th of May 1730. 
His remaining years were passed at Raynham, where he inte- 
rested himself in agriculture and was responsible for introducing 
into England the cultivation of turnips on a large scale and for 
other improvements of the kind. He died at Raynham on the- 
21st of June 1738. 

Townshend was twice married — first to Elizabeth (d. 1711), 
daughter of Thomas Pelham, ist Baron Pelham of Laughton, 
and secondly to Dorothy (d. 1726), sister of Sir Robert Walpole. 
He had eight sons. The eldest son, Charles, the 3rd viscount 
(1700-1764), was called to the House of Lords in 1723. The 
second son, Thomas Townshend (1701-1780), was member of 
parliament for the university of Cambridge from 1727 to 1774; 
his only son, Thomas Townshend (1733-1800), who was created 
Baron Sydney in 1783 and Viscount Sydney in 1789, was a 
secretary of state and leader of the House of Commons from July 
1782 to April 1783, and from December 1783 to June 1789 
again a secretary of state, Sydney in New South Wales being 
named after him; his grandson, John Robert Townshend (1805- 
1890), the 3rd viscount, was created Earl Sydney in 1874, the 
titles becoming extinct at his death. Charles Townshend's eldest 
son by his second wife was George Townshend (1715-1769), 
who after serving for many years in the navy, became an 
admiral in 1765. The third viscount had two sons, George, 
ist Marquess Townshend, and Charles Townshend, who are 
separately noticed. 

For the 2nd viscount see W. Coxe, Memoirs of Sir Robert Wal' 
pole (1816) ; W. E. H. Lecky, History of England in the 28th Century 
(1892); and Earl Stanhope, History of England, 

TOWNSHEND, GEORGE TOWNSHEND, ist Marquess (1724- 
1807), eldest son of Charles, 3rd Viscount Townshend (1700- 
1764), and brother of the politician Charles Townshend (q.v.), 
was born on the 28th of February 1724, his godfather being 
George I. Joining Cope's dragoons as a captain, he saw some 
service in the Netherlands in 1745, and as a member of the duke 
of Cumberland's staff was present at Culloden. Afterwards he 
accompanied the duke to the Netherlands, and was present at 
Lauffeld. By 1750 he had become lieutenant-colonel in the 
ist Foot Guards, but differences withthe duke of Cumherland 
led to his retirement in that year. This difference soon became 
hostility, and, coupled with his dread of permanent armies, 
caused him to give' vehement support to the Militia Bill. In

this matter his views and his methods of expressing them raised 
up a host of enemies. The retirement of the duke after the 
disastrous campaign in North Germany in 1757 brought Towns- 
hcnd back to active service as a colonel, and in 1758 he sailed 
for North America as one of Wolfe's three brigadiers. In the 
long and painful operations against Quebec he showed himself 
a capable officer, but his almost open dissatisfaction with Wolfe's 
methods sensibly added to the difficulty of the enterprise. At 
the battle of the Heights of Abraham the command, on the death 
of Wolfe and the wounding of Monckton, devolved upon Towns- 
hend, whose over-caution for a time imperilled the success of 
the British arms. The loss of Montcalm, however, had similarly 
paralyzed the French, and the crisis passed. Townshend sent 
home a despatch, announcing the fall of Quebec, which at once 
became the butt of the wits and the object of criticism of a more 
serious kind; and when, Monckton having taken over the com- 
mand in Canada, Townshend returned to England to enjoy, as 
he hoped, the hero-worship of the public, he was soon involved 
in bitter controversies. He succeeded to the title in 1764 
on his father's death, and in 1767, through his brother's influence, 
was made lord-lieutenant of Ireland. The story of his vice- 
royalty may be read in the article on him in the Diet. Nat. Biog., 
and in Lecky's History of England in the 18th Century (vol. iv.). 
With the best will in the world, and in spite of excellent capacity, 
he came into continual conflict with the Irish House of Commons 
in his attempt to form an English party in Ireland, and he 
excited unmeasured abuse. In 1772 he was recalled. In 1787 
he was created Marquess Townshend of Rainham. He died on 
the 14th of September 1807. 

Townshend was twice married — first to Charlotte, Baroness 
de Ferrars (d. 1770) and secondly to Anne Montgomery (d. 1819). 
His eldest son George (1 7 55-181 1), who became the second 
marquess, had succeeded to the barony of de Ferrars in 1770 
and had been created earl of Leicester in 1784. Although he 
was in turn master of the mint, joint postmaster-general and 
lord steward of the royal household, he did not take much part 
in politics, but showed a great taste for antiquarian studies. 
His elder son, George Ferrars Townshend, the 3rd marquess 
(1778-1855), was disinherited by his father for conduct which 
also compelled him to reside outside England. When he died 
at Genoa in December 1855 the earldom of Leicester became 
extinct. The marquessate, however, passed to a cousin, John 
Townshend (1798-1863), who became the 4th marquess. John 
James Dudley Stuart Townshend (b. 1866), who became the 6th 
marquess in 1899, came prominently before the public in 1906 
in consequence of a judicial inquiry into his sanity, the decision 
being that he was not capable of managing his own affairs. 

TOWNSVILLE, a town of Elphinstone county, Queensland, 
Australia, 870 m. direct N.W. of Brisbane. Pop. (1901), 12,717. 
It is the seat of the Anglican bishop of North Queensland and has 
a cathedral and several handsome buildings, including the supreme 
court and the custom-house. It is picturesquely situated partly 
on the slopes of Castle Hill and Melton Hill, and partly on the 
banks of Ross Creek, which is spanned by the Victoria Bridge, a 
swing bridge 550 ft. in length, worked by hydraulic power. The 
tidal harbour is enclosed by stone breakwaters, and large vessels 
enter and load frozen meat direct from the refrigerator cars. 
The port is an outlet for a wide area of pastoral country and for 
several goldfields, and has regular communication with all ports 
north and south by lines of steamers. The immigration barracks 
on Ross Island have accommodation for five hundred persons. 
The railway station is the terminus of the Northern line, which 
extends 236 m. to Hughenden. Townsville was founded in 1864 
by John Medwin Black and named after his partner Captain 
Towns. A municipal charter was granted in 1866I 

TOWTON, a village of Yorkshire, England, *\ m. S. of Tad- 
caster, the scene of a battle fought on Palm Sunday, the 29th of 
March 1461, between the armies of York and Lancaster. The 
party of Lancaster had lately won the battle of St Albans, but, 
unable to gain admission into London, and threatened by the 
approach of Edward the young duke of York from the west of 
England, was compelled to fall back northward. York, having 



been proclaimed as Edward IV. on the 2nd, 3rd and 4th of March 
1460/1461, followed them up into Yorkshire, and on the 27th his 
leading troops surprised the passage of the Aire at Ferrybridge. 
The Lancastrians were encamped at Towton, some miles away, 
covering Tadcaster and York; but a force under Lord Clifford 
was promptly sent out, recaptured Ferrybridge by surprise, and 
cut to pieces the Yorkist garrison. About the same time, how- 
ever, Edward's van, under Lord Fauconberg, an experienced 
soldier, crossed the Aire higher up, and Clifford was compelled 
to retire. He was closely pressed, and at Dintingdale, within a 
few furlongs of his own camps, was cut off and killed with nearly 
all his men. Edward's main body was now close at hand, and the 
Lancastrians drew up on their chosen battlefield early on the 
29th. This field was an elevated plateau, with steep slopes, 
between the present Great North Road and the river Cock, cut 
in two by a depression called Towton Dale. On opposite sides 
of this depression stood the two armies, that of York facing north, 
their opponents southward. Both lines of battle were very 
dense. On a front of little more than a thousand yards the 
Lancastrian party had nearly 60,000 men. Edward's force 
(less than 50,000) was not all present, the rear " battle " under 
Norfolk being still distant. Snow and sleet blew in the faces 
of the Lancastrians and covered the field of battle. The skilful 
Fauconberg used this advantage to the utmost. Aided by the 
wind, his archers discharged flights of arrows against the enemy, 
who replied blindly and feebly, hampered by snow and wind. 
The Yorkists withdrew until the enemy had exhausted their 
quivers, and then advanced afresh. Their arrows soon stung the 
Lancastrians into a wild and disorderly charge. Suffering severe 
losses the latter closed with Edward's line of battle. No quarter 
was given by either party, and on the narrow front the numerical 
superiority of the Lancastrians counted for little. The long, 
doubtful and sanguinary struggle was only decided by the arrival 
of Norfolk's corps, which charged the enemy in flank. Driven 
backwards and inwards, the Lancastrians were in a desperate 
position, for their only way of escape to Tadcaster crossed the 
swollen waters of the Cock by a single narrow and difficult ford, 
and when, after a stubborn struggle, they finally broke and fled, 
they were slaughtered in thousands as they tried to cross. At the 
close of the day the defeated army had ceased to exist. Twenty- 
five thousand Lancastrian and eight thousand Yorkist dead were 
buried in and about Towton. The neighbourhood of the battle- 
field contains many relics and memorials of this, the greatest 
battle hitherto fought on English soil. Particularly well pre- 
served is the tomb of Lord Dacre, a prominent Lancastrian, 
in Saxton churchyard.

with poisons, their effects and antidotes, &c. For the general 
treatment of the subject and for the law relating to the sale 
thereof see Poisons, and for the criminal- law see Medical 
Jurisprudence. The term " toxic," meaning poisonous, is 
derived from Gr. t6£op, bow, owing to the custom of smearing 
arrows with poison. 

TOXODONTIA, a sub-order of extinct South American Tertiary 
ungulate mammals typified by the genus Toxodon, so named 
from the bow-like curvature of the molar teeth. They all show 
signs of distant kinship to the Perissodactyla, as regards both 
limb-structure and dentition; while some exhibit resemblance 
to the Rodents and Hyraxes — resemblances which, however, 
are probably to be attributed to parallelism in development. 

Under the sub-order Toxodontia may be included not only the 
typical Toxodon, but the more aberrant Typotherium (fig. 1) of the 
Pleistocene of Buenos Aires and the smaller Pachyrucus and Hegeto- 
therium of the Patagonian Santa Cruz beds. All the members 
of the sub-order have tall-crowned and curved cheek-teeth, some 
or all of which generally have persistent pulps, while at least one pair 
of incisors in each jaw is rootless. The bodies of the cervical 
vertebrae have flat articular^ surfaces, the bones of the two rows 
of the carpus alternate, and in the tarsus the navicular articulates 
with the calcaneum, which, as in the Artiodactyla, is articulated 
to the fibula, while the astragalus, which is slightly grooved above, 



ii4 

is formed on the Perissodactyle plan. The number of toes varies 
between three and five, of which the middle one is the largest, and 
the femur may or may not have a third trochanter. The Typo- 
theriidac and Pachyrucidae are remarkable among the Ungulates for

molars. The toes were unguiculate rather than ungulate in character, 
except the hind ones (four in number) of Typotherium. Certain 
allied Patagonian forms, such as Argyrohyrax, have been supposed 
to be related to the Hyraxes. 

The Toxodontidae differ from the preceding families by the loss 
of the clavicles and the reduction of the digits to three in each foot. 
The typical genus Toxodon is represented by animals the size of a

rhinoceros, of which the entire skeleton is now known (fig. 2). The 
teeth, of which the formula is i. f, c. J p. |=|, m. j, all grow from per- 
sistent pulps; those of the cheek-series are very tall, highly curved, 
and with a simplified crown-structure. In the older Nesodon, on 
the other hand, the cheek-teeth are shorter-crowned, and depart 
less widely from a generalized Perissodactyle type, the total number 
of teeth being forty-four, and there being scarcely any gap in the 
series. Very remarkable changes occur in the dentition as age 
advances, most of the teeth eventually developing roots, although 
the second pair of incisors in each jaw was rootless. The complete 



skeleton is not yet known, but it is ascertained that the femur 
differs fromthat of Toxodon in the retention of a third trochanter. 

Toxodon is typified by T. platensis from the Pampean formation 
of Buenos Aires. Toxodontqtherium and Xotodon are allied but 
rather older types. Nesodon is fr*om the Santa Cruz beds of Patagonia, 
the typical N. imbricatus having a skull about a foot in length, but 
N. ovinus was a smaller animal, about the size of a sheep.

TOY, CRAWFORD HOWELL (1836- ), American Hebrew 
scholar, was born in Norfolk, Virginia, on the 23rd of March 1836. 
He graduated at the university of Virginia in 1856, and studied 
at the university of Berlin in 1 866-1 868. In 1860-1879 he was 
professor of Hebrew in the Southern Baptist Theological 
Seminary (first in Greenville, South Carolina, and after 1877 in 
Louisville, Kentucky), and in 1880 he became professor of 
Hebrew and Oriental languages in Harvard University, where 
until 1903 he was also Dexter lecturer on biblical literature. 

He wrote The Religion of Israel (1882); Quotations from the Old 
Testament in the New Testament (1884); Judaism and Christianity 
(1890); and the Book of Proverbs (1899) in the " International 
Critical Commentary"; and edited a translation of Erdmann's 
commentary on Samuel (1877) in Lange's commentaries; Murray's 
Origin of the Psalms (1880); and, in Haupt's Sacred Books of the 
Old Testament, the Book of Ezekiel (Hebrew text and English version, 
1899). 

TOY (an adaptation of Du. tuig } tools, implements, stuff, 
speltuigy playthings, i.e. stuff to play with, spelen, to play), a 
child's plaything, also a trifle, a worthless, petty ornament, 
a gew-gaw, a bauble. Children's toys and playthings survive 
from the most remote periods of man's life on the earth, though 
many so-called diminutive objects made and used by primitive 
man, sometimes classified as playthings, may have been work- 
men's models, votive offerings or sepulchral objects. A large 
number of wooden, earthenware, stone or metal dolls remain 
with which the children of ancient Egypt once played; thus 
in the British Museum collection there is a flat painted wooden 
doll with strings of mud-beads representing the hair, a bronze 
woman doll bearing a pot on her head, an earthenware doll 
carrying and nursing a child; some have movable jointed arms. 
There are also many toy animals, such as a painted wooden 

calf, a porcelain 
elephant with a 
rider; this once had 
movable legs,which 
have disappeared. 
Balls are found 
made of leather 
stuffed with hair, 
chopped straw and 
other material, and 
also of blue porce- 
lain or papyrus. 
Jointed dolls, 
moved by strings, 
were evidently 
favourite play- 
things of the Greek 
and Roman chil- 
dren, and small 
modelsof furniture, 
chairs, tables, sets 
of jugs painted with 
scenes of children's 
life survive from 
both Greek and 
Roman times. 
Balls, tops, rattles 
and the implements of numerous games, still favourites in all 
countries and every age, remain to show how little the amuse- 
ments of children have changed.

TRABEATED— TRACERY 



ii5 



a distinguished surgeon, was born in London on the 23rd of 
August 1852. He had originally intended to enter the army, 
but ill health and a growing love of books changed his plans, 
and he settled down to read for the bar. Here again the same 
causes produced a change of purpose, and he entered as a 
student at Pembroke College, Oxford. Finding himself by 
no means at ease in that college he migrated after two years 
to Balliol College. Continued ill health prevented his reading 
for honours, but he made so deep an impression on the authori- 
ties of his college that on taking his degree he was appointed 
lecturer and tutor to students preparing for the Indian civil 
service. He devoted himself to the study of economics and 
economic history. He was active also as a practical social 
reformer, taking part in much public work and delivering 
lectures in the large industrial centres on economic problems. 
He overtaxed his strength, and after lecturing in London in 
January 1883 he had a complete break-down, and died of 
inflammation of the brain at Wimbledon on the 9th of March. 

Toynbeehad a striking influence on his contemporaries, not merely 
through his intellectual powers, but by his strength of character. 
He left behind him a beautiful memory, filled as he was with the 
love of truth and an ardent and active zeal for the public good. He 
was the author of some fragmentary pieces, published after his 
death by his widow, under the title of The Industrial Revolution. 
This volume deserves attention both for its intrinsic merit and as 
indicating the first drift of a changing method in the treatment of 
economic problems. He, however, fluctuated considerably in his 
opinion of the Ricardian political economy, in one place declaring 
it to be a detected " intellectual imposture," whilst elsewhere, 
apparently under the influence of Bagehot, he speaks of it as having 
been in recent times " only corrected, re-stated, and put into the 
proper relation to the science of life," meaning apparently, by this 
last, general sociology. He saw that the great help in the future 
for the science of economics must come from the historical method, 
to which in his own researches he gave preponderant weight. Toyn- 
bee' s interest in the poor and his anxiety to be personally acquainted 
with them led to his close association with the district of White- 
chapel in London, where the Rev. Canon S. A. Barnett (q.v.) was 
at that time vicar — an association which was commemorated after 
his death by the social settlement of Toynbee Hall, the first of many 
similar institutions erected in the East End of London for the purpose 
of uplifting and brightening the lives of the poorer classes. 

See F. C. Montague's Arnold Toynbee (Johns Hopkins University 
Studies, 1889); Lord Milner's Arnold Toynbee: a Reminiscence 
(1901); and L. L. Price's Short History' of Political Economy in 
England for a criticism of Toynbee as an economist. 

TRABEATED, the architectural term given to those styles 
in which the architrave or beam (Lat. Irabs) is employed instead 
of the arch, in the latter case the term " arcuated " being used. 
The principal trabeatcd styles are the Egyptian, Persian, 
Greek, Lycian, nearly all the Indian styles, the Chinese, 
Japanese and South American styles, in all cases owing their 
origin to the timber construction, for which reason the term 
post-and-lintel architecture is sometimes applied to it. 

TRACERY, a late coined word from " trace," track, Lat. 
trakere, to draw; the term given in architecture (French 
equivalents are rSseau, remplissage) to the intersecting rib- 
work in* the upper part of a Gothic window; applied also to 
the interlaced work of a vault, or on walls, in panels and in 
tabernacle work or screens. The tracery in windows is usually 
divided into two sections, plate tracery and rib or bar tracery, 
the latter rising out of the former, and entirely superseding 
it in the geometrical, flowing and rectilineal designs. The 
windows of the Early English period were comparatively 
narrow slits, and were sometimes grouped together under a 
single enclosing arch; the piercing of the tympanum of this 
arch with a circular light produced what is known as plate 
tracery, which is found in windows of the late 12th century, 
as in St Maurice, York, but became more common in the first 
half of the 13th century. In England the opening pierced in 
the head was comparatively small, its diameter never exceeding 
the width of one of the windows below, but in France it 
occupied the full width of the enclosing arch and was filled 
with cusping, and sometimes, as in Chartres, with cusping in 
the centre and a series of small quatrefoils round, all pierced 
on one plane face. In order further to enrich the mullions and 
arches of the window, they were moulded, as in Stowe church, 



Kent; the other portions were pierced; and finally, to give 
more importance to the principal lights, additional depth was 
given to their mouldings, so that they gradually developed into 
bar or rib tracery, of which the earliest examples in England 
are those in Westminster Abbey (c. 1250) and Netley Abbey 
near Southampton. Henceforth that which is described in 
architecture as the " element " ruled the design of the window, 
and led to the development of geometrical tracery, in which 
the bars or ribs are all about equidistant from one another. 
In windows of three lights the heads of the windows consisted 
of three circular openings, but with four lights they were grouped 
in two pairs, with a single circle over each and a larger one at 
the top in the centre. This led to increased dimensions being 
given to the moulding of the enclosing arches and the upper 
circle, forming virtually two planes in the tracery. In the 
great east window at Lincoln, with eight lights, there was a 
double subdivision and three planes, and here the upper circle 
was filled with semicircles, so that the openings were all about 
the same width. In France the upper circle always maintained 
its predominance, its subdivisions only retaining the scale. 
The next development, which would seem to have taken place 
in Gloucester Cathedral, was the omission of portions of the 
enclosing circle, so as to allow the ribs to run one into the other, 
forming therefore lines of double curvature, and giving rise 
to what is known as flowing or flamboyant tracery, of which 
the great window in Carlisle Cathedral is the most important 
example. In this window there are nine lights, the four outer 
ones in each rib being grouped together; these were not sub- 
divided again,fand consequently there are only two planes of 
tracery. The Perpendicular style which followed might per- 
haps be considered as a reaction against the abuse of the flowing 
lines in masonry, were it not that in the earlier examples it 
appears timidly. At Edington church in Wiltshire (1361), 
in a five-light window, the centre light is wider than the others 
and its mullions run straight up into the arch mould. In New 
College chapel, Oxford (1386), the head of the window is sub- 
divided into narrow vertical lights, each half the width of those 
below, and this is followed in some counties, but not in all, in 
the east of England the flamboyant tracery being retained a 
century later. In St Mary's church, Oxford, with seven lights, 
all the mullions run straight up into the arch mould, and another 
feature is introduced, already found in New College chapel, 
and at a much earlier date in domestic work and in spire-lights, 
viz. the transom. In the later Perpendicular work another 
change takes place; the pointed arch struck from two centres 
is replaced by one struck from four centres, and this eventually 
in domestic work is superseded by the flat arch. 

So far reference has been made only to that which may be called 
the " element " of the window. The enrichment of the lights with 
cusping gave additional beauty to them, took away the hard wire- 
drawn effect of the mouldings, and formed openings of great variety; 
in some of the windows of the Decorated period the ball flower and 
other foliage is introduced into the mouldings. In French work 
the geometrical style lasted till the 14th century, and then there 
was a lapse in building, so that the flamboyant style which followed, 
and from which at one time it was assumed that the English mason 
had derived the style, was apparently taken up by the French after 
its abandonment _ in England in favour of Perpendicular work. 
Germany and Spain have always followed in the wake of the French ; 
and in Italy, where architects preferred to decorate their walls with 
frescoes, the light from stained glass interfered with their effect, 
so that there was no demand for huge windows or their subdivision 
with mullions. At the same time there are many beautiful examples 
of tracery in Italy, generally in marble, such as those of Giotto's 
Campanile and the cathedral at Florence, in the Ducal and other 
palaces at Venice, and in the triforium arcades of Pisa and Siena 
cathedrals; but they destroyed its effect by the insertion of small 
capitals to the mullions, which gave horizontal lines where they 
were not wanted, virtually dividing the window into two parts 
instead of emphasizing, as was done in the Perpendicular period, 
the verticality of the mullions. 

Among the most glorious features in the Gothic architecture of 
France, England and Spain are the immense rose windows which were 
introduced, generally speaking, in the transepts of the cathedrals; 
the tracery of these follows on the lines of those of the windows, 
changing from geometrical to Decorated and afterwards to flam- 
boyant. In some respects perhaps the finest examples of plate- 
tracery were produced in the rose windows of the 13th century.

TRACHELIUM— TRACHYTE 



Thus in France in the rose window of Chartres in the west front 
(1225), and in England in those of Barfreston in Kent (1180) and 
Beverley Minster in Yorkshire (1220), plate-tracery- of such great 
beauty is found that it is unfortunate it should have been entirely 
superseded by rib-tracery. The rose window of Lincoln Cathedral 
in the north transept is a compromise between the two, as all the 
lights are cut out independently and in one plane, but there are 
mouldings round each connected with flowers; in its design and 
effect this window is far superior to the flamboyant circular window 
in the south transept. Sometimes a rose window is arranged in the 
upper portion of an ordinary window,asin the westfront of Lichfield 
Cathedral, and this is constantly found in those of the transepts 
of the French cathedrals. In the south of Italy, at Bari, Bitonto 
and Troja, and at Orvieto and Assisi, farther north, thereare examples 
of rose windows, but inferior in design to French and English work, 
though elaborated with carving. The revival of the 16th century 
was Fatal so far as tracery was concerned ; in the place of the flam- 
boyant work of the last phase of Gothic in France semicircular and 
elliptical curves with poor mouldings were introduced, and_ the 
elaborate cusping which gave such interest to the light was omitted 
altogether, as in St Eustache, Paris. There is, however, one remark- 
able example in the church of Le Grand Andely, in Normandy, 
dating from the Henri II. period, in which a return was made to 
the tracery of the 13th century; but the introduction of Renaissance 
details in the place of the cusping is not altogether satisfactory, 
though the general design is fine. 

The tracery decorating the vault of Gothic work began on the 
introduction of the fan vault at Gloucester (see Vauit); it was only 
a surface decoration, both rib and web being cut out of the same 
block of stone, and it received further development in the various 
phases which followed. In the later Perpendicular work the walls 
and buttresses were all panelled with blank tracery, the most com- 
plete example of which is found in Henry VII/s chapel, Westminster 
Abbey. 

In tabernacle work the tracery is purely of a decorative character, 
copied in miniature from the mullions, arch-moulds and crockets 
of Gothic work. 

Some of the most beautiful examples of tracery are those on the 
rood screens of churches, either in stone as in the Jube" of the Made- 
leine at Troyes, or in wood as in the rood screens of the churches 
in East Anglia and in Somersetshire; and with this must be included 
that which was introduced into the panelling of church doors, choir 
stalls and other church fittings; this was continued, first in the early 
Renaissance of the 16th century, the finest examples being those 
of the stalls of King's College, Cambridge, and afterwards in the 
Jacobean style, in the church at Croxcombe near Shepton Mallet, 
and the church of St John at Leeds, the two latter ranking as the 
best work of that late period. (R. P. S. ) 

TRACHELIUM (Gr. rpax^Xos, neck), the term in architecture 
given to the neck of the capital of the Doric and Ionic orders. 
In the Greek Doric capital it is the space between the annulets 
of the echinus and the grooves which marked the junction of 
the shaft and capital; in some early examples, as in the basilica 
and temple of Ceres at Paestum and the temple at Metapontum, 
it forms a sunk concave moulding, which by the French is 
called the gorge. In the Roman Doric and the Ionic orders 
the term is given by modern writers to the interval between 
the lowest moulding of the capital and the top of the astragal 
and fillet, which were termed the " hypotrachelium " (q.v.). 

TRACHEOTOMY, the operation of opening the trachea or 
windpipe (see Respiratory System) and inserting a tube 
(canula) to provide a means of breathing when the natural 
air-passage is obstructed. The operation is by no means easy 
when performed on a small child, for the wind-pipe is deeply 
placed amongst important structures. The chief anxiety is 
in connexion with haemorrhage, for the vessels are large and 
generally overfull on account of the impairment of the respira- 
tion. The higher the opening is made in the trachea the easier 
and safer is the operation. 

TRACHIS, a city of ancient Greece, situated at the head of 
the Malian Gulf in a small plain between the rivers Asopus and 
Melas, and enclosed by the mountain jvall of Oeta which here 
extended close to the sea and by means of the Trachinian 
Cliffs completely commanded the main road from Thessaly. 
The position was well adapted as an advanced post against 
invaders from the north, and furthermore guarded the road 
up the Asopus gorge into the Cephissus valley. Strangely 
enough; it is not recorded what part Trachis played in the 
defence of Thermopylae against Xerxes. Its military impor- 
tance was recognized in 427 B.C. by the Spartans, who sent a 
garrison to guard the Trachinian plain against the marauding 



highland tribes of Oeta and built a citadel close by the 
Asopus gorge with the new name of Heraclea. The Spartans 
failed to safeguard Heraclea against the Oetaeans and 
Thessalians, and for a short time were displaced by the 
Thebans (420). After a bloody defeat at the hands of the 
neighbouring mountaineers (409) the Spartan governor quar- 
relled with the native settlers, whom he expelled in 399. 
Four years later Thebes used her new predominance in central 
Greece to restore the Trachinians, who retained Heraclea until 
371, when Jason of Pherae seized and dismantled it. The 
fortress was rebuilt, and after 280 served the Aetolians as a 
bulwark against Celts and Macedonians. It was captured 
in 191 by the Romans, but restored to the Aetolian League 
until 146. Henceforth the place lost its importance; in 
Strabo's time the original site was apparently deserted, and 
the citadel alone remained inhabited.

TRACHOMA, the name given to a chronic destructive form 
of inflammation of the conjunctiva of the eye (see Eye : Diseases) , 
or " granular conjunctivitis " (Egyptian ophthalmia). It is 
a contagious disease, associated with dirty conditions, and 
common in Egypt, Arabia and parts of Europe, especially 
among the lower class of Jews. Hence it has become important, 
in connexion with the alien immigration into the United King- 
dom and America, and the rejection of those who are afflicted 
with it. It is important that all cases should be isolated, and 
that the spread of the infection should be prevented. 

TRACHYTE (Gr. rpaxfa, rough), in petrology, a group of 
volcanic rocks which consist mainly of sanidine (or glassy 
orthoclase) felspar. Very often they have minute irregular 
steam cavities which make the broken surfaces of specimens 
of these rocks rough and irregular, and from this character 
they have derived their name. It was first given by Haiiy 
to certain rocks of this class from Auvergne, and was long 
used in a much wider sense than that defined above, in fact 
it included quartz-trachytes (now known as liparites and 
rhyolites) and oligoclase-trachytes, which are now more properly 
assigned to andesites. The trachytes are often described as 
being the volcanic equivalents of the plutonic syenites. Their 
dominant mineral, sanidine felspar, very commonly occurs 
in two generations, i.e. both as large well-shaped porphyritic 
crystals and in smaller imperfect rods or laths forming a finely 
crystalline groundmass. With this there is practically always 
a smaller amount of plagioclase, usually oligoclase; but the 
potash felspar (sanidine) often contains a considerable pro- 
portion of the soda felspar, and has rather the characteristics 
of anorthoclase or cryptoperthite than of pure sanidine. 

Quartz is typically absent from the trachytes, but tridymite 
(which likewise consists of silica) is by no means uncommon 
in them. It is rarely in crystals large enough to be visible 
without the aid of the microscope, but in thin slides it may 
appear as small hexagonal plates, which overlap and form 
dense aggregates, like a mosaic or like the tiles on a roof. 
They often cover the surfaces of the larger felspars or line the 
steam cavities of the rock, where they may be mingled with 
amorphous opal or fibrous chalcedony. In the older trachytes 
secondary quartz is not rare, and probably sometimes results 
from the recrystallization of tridymite. 

Of the ferromagnesian minerals present augite is the most 
common. It is usually of pale green colour, and its small 
crystals are often very perfect in form. Brown hornblende 
and biotite occur also, and are usually surrounded by black 
corrosion borders composed of magnetite and pyroxene. Some- 
times the replacement is complete and no hornblende or biotite 
is left, though the outlines of the cluster of magnetite and 
augite may clearly indicate from which of these minerals it 
was derived. Olivine is unusual,. though found in some tra- 
chytes, like those of the Arso in Ischia. Basic varieties of 
plagioclase, such as labradorite, are known also as phenocrysts 



TRACT

in some Italian trachytes. Dark brown varieties of augite and 
rhombic pyroxene (hypersthene or bronzite) have been observed 
but are not common. Apatite, zircon and magnetite are prac- 
tically always present as unimportant accessory minerals. 

The trachytes being very, rich in potash felspar, necessarily 
contain considerable amounts of alkalis; in this character they 
approach the phonolites. Occasionally minerals of the fels- 
pathoid group, such as nepheline, sodalite and leucite, occur, 
and rocks of this kind are known as phonolitic trachytes. The 
soda-bearing amphiboles and pyroxenes so characteristic of the 
phonolites may also be found in some trachytes; thus aegirine 
or aegironic augite forms outgrowths on diopside crystals, and 
riebeckite may be present in spongy growths among the felspars 
of the groundmass (as in the trachyte of Berkum on the Rhine). 
Trachytic rocks are typically porphyritic, and some of the best- 
known examples, such as the trachyte of Drachenfels on the 
Rhine, show this character excellently, having large sanidine 
crystals of tabular form an inch or two in length scattered 
through their fine-grained groundmass. In many trachytes, 
however, the phenocrysts are few and small, and the ground- 
mass comparatively coarse. The ferromagnesian minerals 
rarely occur in large crystals, and are usually not conspicuous 
in hand specimens of these rocks. Two types of ground- 
mass are generally recognized: the trachytic, composed 
mainly of long, narrow, sub-parallel rods of sanidine, and 
the orthophyric, consisting of small, squarish or rectan- 
gular prisms of the same mineral. Sometimes granular 
augite or spongy riebeckite occurs in the groundmass, but 
as a rule this part of the rock is highly felspathic. Glassy 
forms of trachyte (obsidians) occur, as in Iceland, and 
pumiceous varieties are known (in Teneriffe and elsewhere), 
but these rocks as contrasted with the rhyolites have a remark- 
ably strong tendency to crystallize, and are rarely to any 
considerable extent vitreous. 

Trachytes are well represented among the Tertiary and Recent 
volcanic rocks of Europe. \n Britain they occur in Skye as lava 
flows and as dikes or intrusions, but they are much more common 
on the continent of Europe, as in the Rhine district and the Eifel, 
also in Auvergne, Bohemia and the Euganean Hills. In the neigh- 
bourhood of Rome, Naples and the island of Ischia trachytic lavas 
and tuffs are of common occurrence. In America trachytes are 
less frequent, being known in S. Dakota (Black Hills). In Iceland, 
the Azores, Teneriffe and Ascension there are Recent trachytic 
lavas, and rocks of this kind occur also in New South Wales (Cambe- 
warra range), East Africa, Madagascar, Aden and in many other 
districts. 

Among the older volcanic rocks trachytes also are not 
scarce, though they have often been described under the 
names orthophyre and^ orthoclase-porphyry, while " trachyte " 
was reserved for Tertiary and Recent rocks of similar com- 
position. In England there are Permian trachytes in the Exeter 
district, and Carboniferous trachytes are found in many parts 
of the central valley of Scotland. The latter ^ differ in no 
essential respect from their modern representatives in Italy 
and the Rhine valley, but their augite and biotite are often 
replaced by chlorite and other secondary products. Permian 
trachytes occur also in Thuringia and the Saar district in Germany. 

Closely allied to the trachytes are the Keratophyres, which occur 
mainly in Palaeozoic strata in the Harz (Germany), in the Southern 
Uplands of Scotland, in Cornwall^ &c. They are usually por- 
phyritic and fluidal ; and consist mainly of alkali felspar (anortho- 
clase principally, but also albite and orthoclase), with a small 
quantity of chlorite and' iron oxides. Many of them are lavas, but 



for a lengthy monograph on a subject, dealing with it technically 
and authoritatively, whereas a tract is understood to be brief 
and rather argumentative than educational. There is, again, 
the rarer word tractate, which is not a tract, in the precise sense, 
so much as a short treatise. 

The word " tract " has come to be used for brief discourses 
of a moral and religious character only, and in modern practice 
it seems to be mainly confined to serious and hortatory themes. 
An essay on poetry, or the description of a passage of scenery, 
would not be styled a tract. In the Protestant world, the 
tract which Luther composed in 1520, on the Babylonish 
captivity, has been taken more or less as the type of this species 
of literature, which, however, existed long before his day, both 
in Latin and in the vernacular tongues of western Europe. 
It is difficult, if not impossible, in early history, to distinguish 
the tract from other cognate forms of moralizing literature, 
but it may perhaps be said that the homilies of ^Elfric (955- 
1025?) are the earliest specimens of this class in English litera- 
ture. Four centuries later Wyclif issued a series of tracts, 
which were remarkable for their vigour, and exercised a strong 
influence on medieval theology. Bishop Reginald Pecock 
published many controversial tracts between 1440 and 1460. 
Sir Thomas More, John Fisher (d. 1535) and William Tyndale 
were prominent writers of controversial treatises. It was the 
Martin Marprelate agitation, in the reign of Elizabeth, which 
led from 1588 to 1591 to the most copious production of tracts 
in English literature; of these nearly thirty survive. On the 
Puritan side the principal writers were John Udall (1560-1592), 
Henry Barrowe (d. 1593), John Penry (1550-1593) and Job 
Throckmorton (1 545-1601), the tracts being printed in the 
house of the last-mentioned; on the side of the Established 
Church the principal authors were Bishop Thomas Cooper 
(151 7-1 594) and the poets Lyly and Nash. An enormous 
collection of tracts was published between 171 7 and 1720 in 
elucidation of what is known as the Bangorian Controversy, 
set in motion by a sermon of Benjamin Hoadly, bishop of 
Bangor, on " The Nature of the Kingdom of Christ " (17 17). 
Convocation considered this a treatise likely to impugn and 
impeach the royal supremacy in religious questions. A vast 
number of writers took part in the dispute, and Thomas Sherlock 
(1678-1761) fell into disgrace through the violence of his 
contributions to it. Convocation was finally obliged to 
give way. 

The most famous collection of tracts published in the course 
of the 19th century was that produced from 1833 onwards by 
Newman, Keble and E. B. Pusey, under the title of "Tracts 
for the Times." Among these Pusey's "Tract on Baptism" 
(1835) and his " On the Holy Eucharist" (1836) had a profound 
effect in leading directly to the foundation of the High Church 
party, so much so that the epithet " Tractarian " was bar- 
barously coined to designate those who wished to oppose the 
spread of rationalism by a quickening of the Church of England. 
In 1841 Newman's " Tract No. XC." was condemned by the 
heads of houses in Oxford, and led to the definite organization 
of the High Church forces. (X.)

TRACT (from Lat. tractare, to treat of a matter, through 
Provencal tractat and Ital. trattato), in the literary signification, 
a work in which some particular subject, or aspect of a subject, 
is treated. As far as derivation is concerned, a tract is identical 
with a treatise, but by custom the latter word has come to be used 



tract form. They vary in importance from the Society for 
Promoting Christian Knowledge (London), the Religious Tract 
Society (London) and the American Tract Society (New York) — 
all of which are publishing houses of recognized standing — to 
small and purely local organizations for distributing evangelistic 
and pastoral literature. It was not until the Evangelical Revival 
that tract work began to develop along its modern lines. Start- 
ing from the provision of simple evangelistic literature for home

use, the enterprise grew into the provision of Christian literature, 
not only for home use, but also for the mission fields of the 
world. With this growth there proceeded another develop- 
ment, the production of books and magazines being added to 
that of tracts. The title " Tract Society " has, in fact, become 
misleading, as suggestive of limitations which had but a brief 
existence and are no longer recognized by the more important 
agencies. On the other hand it must not be supposed that 
because the work has gone beyond the provision of tracts, these 
are no longer widely employed. Probably their use in various 
forms at home was never wider than it is to-day; whilst in 
India, China and elsewhere the attack of the Christian tracts 
is being met by the circulation of vernacular tracts in defence 
of the non-Christian faiths. 

The Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge, founded in 1698, 
though most widely known as a publishing agency, assists in a wide 
variety of ways the work of the Church of England. On its publica- 
tion side, it is for its own Church both a Bible society and a tract 
society. Moreover, its publications include not only versions 
of the Holy Scriptures and of the Liturgy, but also theological and 
general literature in many forms. It has given much attention to 
providing good reading for children ; whilst its tract catalogue is 
especially rich in works bearing on Christian evidences, Church 
seasons and the doctrines of the Anglican Church. ♦To the foreign 
missions of the Church the S.P.C.K. has been a helper of the utmost 
value, more especially in regard to their medical missions and their 
use of Christian literature. In the latter case the help is given by 
grants of works produced either at home or by mission presses in 
the field. As early as 1720 it was using Arabic; but it has from time 
to time been of especial value in^ helping to found a Christian 
literature in languages or dialects just reduced to writing. Thus 
whilst recent publications for the mission field include works in 
Arabic, Chinese and Urdu, they also include publications in Addo, 
Lunyoro and Sgau Karen. 

TheReligious Tract Society , founded in 1799, and thus contemporary 
with the great missionary agencies and the Bible Society, is, like the 
last-named, an interdenominational organization. Its earliest 
publications were in^ English and were tracts. But it speedily 
undertook book publications and extended its field of operations. 
It began to provide tracts for China in 1813, and as early as 1817 
an auxiliary tract society was founded at Bellary in India by some 
men of the 84th Regiment. In undertaking book publication, the 
society became one of the pioneers in the provision of sound and 
cheap literature; whilst by the issue of the Sunday at Home, the 
Leisure Hour, the Boy's Own Paper, the Girl's Own Paper, the 
Cottager and Artisan and other periodicals, it helped to lead the 
work in the provision of popular magazines. Like the S.P.C.K., 
the R.T.S. now produces general theological literature as well as 
tracts in a variety of forms, whilst it also gives especial attention 
to the provision of healthy reading matter for young people. Its 
grants of books and tracts are open to members of all Protestant 
denominations. The society aids Protestant communities on the 
Continent by maintaining dep6ts at Madrid, Barcelona, Lisbon, 
Vienna, Budapest and Warsaw; whilst it also assists, by grants, 

Fiublication work in^ France, Italy, Russia, Turkey and Scandinavia, 
n the mission field it works mainly through subsidiary tract societies 
locally organized. The chief of these tract and book societies are 
in India carried on at Calcutta, Madras, Bombay, Bangalore, 
Allahabad and Lahore; in China at Peking, Shanghai, Hong Kong, 
Canton, Hankow, Chung-king and Mukden; and in Japan at Tokio. 
The literature produced by these organizations ranges from com- 
mentaries on the Holy Scriptures to the simplest tracts and leaflets. 
In 1908 the society opened a special fund in aid of its Chinese work, 
and by this means the provision of Christian literature in book 
and tract form for Chinese readers has been greatly extended. 
Much literature for various foreign fields is also produced in Great 
Britain and distributed from the society's headquarters. As with the 
S.P.C.K., the R.T.S. has been of great service in providing (next 
to the Holy Scriptures) the earliest literature for some languages. 
Thus it has helped to provide tracts for the Miaos of west 
China and for the Baganda, together with the Pilgrim's Progress 
in Bembaand in Ewe\ two little-known African tongues. The 
languages in which works produced or aided by the society have 
appeared number about 300. In the distribution of its grants 
01 tracts for home work nearly all the great evangelical organiza- 
tions have a share. In the administration of a subsidiary tract 
society all the evangelical agencies at work in its field are as a rule 
represented. 

In^ addition to the work of these societies, the production and 
distribution of tracts at home is carried on by The Stirling Tract 
Enterprise, wh ; ch also sends grants of its publications to India, 
Ceylon and Africa; by The Children's Special Service Mission, which 
also issues publications in Chinese, Japanese and some Indian 
lanjruages; and by The Scripture Gift Mission, which sends its publi- 
cations into China and the East generally. In the mission field 
The Christian Literature Society for India (formerly the Christian 



Vernacular Educational Society), established in 1858, has its head- 
quarters in London with auxiliary committees in India and Ceylon. 
It will always be associated with the name of Dr John Murdoch 
(d. Aug. 10, _ 1904), its secretary for nearly half a century. It 
works on similar lines to the tract societies, but includes a wider 
range of educational literature, in the provision of which it has 
been especially helpful to the mission schools of India. 

The Christian Literature Society for China (formerly the Society 
for the Diffusion of Literature and General Knowledge among the 
Chinese) is incorporated (1909) in Shanghai, but has an advisory 
committee and an executive committee in London. It has been 
of great service in approaching the official and upper classes of 
China by its magazines and ,books, as well as by the diffusion 
of more popular literature. 

The American Tract Society (New York) works, both in regard 
to domestic and foreign enterprises, upon similar lines to those of 
the Religious Tract Society. Upper Canada has its tract society 
also and similar organizations exist on the continent of Europe.

TRACTION (Lat. trakere, to draw), the act of drawing or 
hauling. As used in this article the term refers to the methods 
of employing animal, and mechanical power for transporting 
persons or things from place to place in wheeled vehicles. 

Animal Traction.— r-The oldest form of motive power is that 
of animals, those most commonly employed for draught purposes 
on ordinary roads being horses, mules, donkeys and oxen. On 
the continent of Europe dogs are often harnessed to light carts 
or barrows, but in England their use in this way was prohibited 
by the Cruelty to Animals Act of 1854. Camels and elephants 
are only rarely used as draught animals in special circumstances. 

When men and animals carry burdens, or draw or propel 
loads in certain vehicles, it is difficult, and sometimes impossible, 
to determine the duty performed in foot-pounds of work, 
hecause of the uncertainty of the amount in pounds of the 
resistance overcome. In this case, for the purpose of comparing 
performances of the same kind with each other, a unit is 
employed called a foot-pound of horizontal transport, meaning 
the conveying of a load of r lb 1 ft. horizontally. The 
following table, given by W. J. Macquorn Rankine, gives 
some examples of the daily duty of men and horses in units 
of horizontal transport, L denoting the load in lb, V the 
velocity in feet per second, and T the number of seconds per

For tramway service, horse, or occasionally mule, traction 
was formerly employed almost universally, but on account of 
limited speed and high cost it has been generally abandoned, 
except in a few localities, where the smallness of the line, low 
value of livestock, labour and feed, and long headway intervals, 
make it still profitable. 

The tractive force required on a straight and level tramway 
is found to vary from T ^ to •£$ of the load, according to the 
condition of the rails. On a tramway having grooved rails 
in average condition it is about tuTF* The resistance is thus, 
at the best, nearly double that on a railway, and sometimes 
as much as on a good paved road. This is due to the friction 
of the flange of the wheel in the grooved rail, and to the fact 
that the latter is always more or less clogged with dirt. The 



TRACTION 



i n 






clearance between the flange and the groove is necessarily 
small, as the former must have sufficient strength, and the 
latter must be narrow. The least inaccuracy of gauge, there- 
fore, causes extra friction, which is greatly increased on curves. 
By removing the flanges from two of the four wheels of the 
tramway car H. E. Tresca (1814-1885) found that the resistance 
was reduced from yfar to j-J-g- of the load. The resistance due 
to gravity is of course not lessened on a tramway; and if y-J^ of 
the load be the tractive force required on the level, twice as 
much, or -gV of the load, will be required on a gradient of 1 in 
100 and three times as much on a gradient of 1 in 50. To 
start a tramcar, four or five times as great a pull is required 
as will keep it in motion afterwards, and the constant starting 
after stoppages, especially on inclines, is destructive to horses. 
Horses employed on tramways are worked only a few hours a 
day, a day's work being a journey of 10 or 12 m., and much 
less on steep gradients. In London a tramcar horse bought 
at the age of five years had to be sold at a low price after about 
four years' work. On the Edinburgh tramways, in consequence 
of steep gradients, the horses lasted a less time, and had 
to be constantly shifted from steep to easier gradients. The 
cost of traction by horses is generally 6d. or 7d. per mile for 
two horses, and more when the gradients are steep (see also 
Tramway) . 

Steam Traction. — The most universally used form of motive 
power is the steam engine, which has been constructed to work 
on ordinary roads, on tramways and on railways. The road 
or traction engine comprises a boiler mounted on wheels, and a 
steam engine usually placed on top of the boiler. The front 
axle is pivoted so that it may be moved by means of a steering 
wheel geared to it, and the rear wheels are geared to the engine. 
The wheel rims are made wide to prevent them from sinking 
in loose earth or muddy roads. The whole arrangement is 
similar to the ordinary wheeled portable boiler and engine with 
the addition of the steering wheel and a gear connexion from the 
engine to the rear wheels. The tractive power of these engines 
is high, but their speed low — usually 4 to 6 m. per hour. 

A peculiar form of road motor is made by equipping the axles of 
a traction engine with the so-called " Pedrail invented by B. J. 
Diplock. This is an arrangement whereby circular pads or feet," 
fastened around the periphery of a wheel, come successively in 
contact with the ground, the motion approximating to a smooth, 
even stepping or walking along. Fourteen of these feet are placed 



on the ground as the movement of the engine proceeds, and the engine 
itself rolls along on the rail portion of the cam which rests on the 
rollers beneath it. Ball and socket joints are used to connect the 
feet to the spokes so that they may rest on any conformation they 
may encounter. This machine has shown a remarkable ability 
to pass over obstacles and rough roads, and even to climb roadless 
hills. It gives a maximum of adhesion of the drivers, and it is 
claimed that it will pass over rough roads with the expenditure 
of less energy than will an ordinary wheeled traction engine. Its 
speed is necessarily low — about 4 m. per hour. 




Fig. 2.— Chain Track Tractor. 

The Hornsby " Chain Track Tractor " (fig. 2), patented by Mr 
David Roberts, is provided with two endless chains, one on each 
side, which^ constitute the track on which the machine travels. 
Each chain is carried on two sprocket wheels, placed at the extreme

Fig. 1. — Principle of the Pedrail's operation, 
around a wheel, and each is attached at the end of a spoke, free 
to slide radially toward and from the hub of the wheel. Each spoke 
has fastened to it a helical spring which tends to draw it inwards. 
On each spoke there is also a roller, which bears against a cam-shaped 
piece placed inside the periphery of the wheel. The engine is sus- 
pended by springs from the cam and is supported by it. The lower 
edge of the cam is practically straight and horizontal, the length of 
this straight portion being great enough to subtend an angle equal 
to the spacing of three spokes, or about 70 . By this means three 
of the feet are always resting on the roadway and support the engine, 
which really slides along on the rollers that are at any instant under- 
neath the flat portion of the cam. The feet take successive positions

ends of the frame^ and is formed of a number pi links (fig. 3) so 
connected that it is free to bend in one direction, as required to 
pass round the sprocket wheels, but is locked into a rigid bar by 
pressure acting in the opposite direction. On their outer surfaces 
these links bear pads or feet, while their inner 
surfaces compose a track upon which roll the 
middle or weight-bearing wheels. Power applied, 
to one of the sprocket wheels exerts a pull on 
the chain, but this^ being held fast by the weight 
of the engine pressing the feet to the ground, the 
effect is to roll the engine along the track, arid 
as this happens the feet at the rear end are one 
by one lifted off the ground, carried round the 
sprocket wheels, and relaid at the front of the 
machine. This construction not only renders the 
whole weight available for adhesion, but also 
provides a long supporting base and thus enables 
the machine to pass over soft ground, loose sand, 
morasses, &c, in ^ which an ordinary traction 
engine would certainly sink. Steering is effected 
by retarding or stopping the motion of the sprocket 
wheels on the side towards which it is desired to 
turn. 

For tramway work steam is scarcely used at 
all now, though small locomotives — usually 
having their engines geared to the driving- 
wheels, instead of the connecting-rods being 
coupled direct to them — have been used in the 
past for this work. They were compactly designed and equipped 
with mufflers to deaden the sound of the exhaust, with other 
devices to decrease noise and smoke. In some instances, the 
engine and boiler were placed in the forward end of a car, a 
partition separating them from the main body of the car in which 
the 1 passengers were carried. 

For description of steam railway engines see Railways: Loco- 
motive Power, and Steam Engine. 

Fireless Engines. — Fireless engines were first tried in New 
Orleans, and were in successful use on tramways in France and 



120 



TRACTION 



Batavia, Java, for some years. The motive power was obtained 
from water heated under pressure to a very high temperature 
in stationary boilers and carried in a reservoir on the engine, 
where it gave off steam as the pressure and temperature* were 
reduced. Two tons of water heated to give a steam-pressure 
of 250 lb to the square inch served for a run of 8 or 10 m., more 
than •£$ of the water and a pressure of 20 to 25 it) above the 
atmosphere hcing left on returning to the boiler station. Large 
boiler-power was required to reheat the engine reservoirs quickly, 
and this could be afforded for only a few engines; hut, when 
worked on a sufficient scale, the firelcss engines were claimed to 
be economical, the economy resulting from the generation of the 
steam in large stationary boilers. 

Compressed Air. — Compressed air as a motive power offers 
the advantage of having neither steam nor the products of 
combustion to be got rid of. In W. D. Scott Moncrieff's engine, 
which was tried on the Vale of Clyde tramways in 1876, air was 
compressed to 310 lb per sq. in., and expanded in the cylinders 
from a uniform working pressure to that of the atmosphere. 
There is a considerable loss of heat during the expansion of the 
air which is attended with a serious loss- of pressure, and in 
L. Mekarski's system, which was in use for the propulsion of 
tramcars at Nantes for a number of years, the loss of pressure 
was considerably lessened by heating the air during expansion. 
The air, at a pressure of 426 ft) per sq. in., was stored in 
cylindrical reservoirs beneath the car, and before use was passed 
through a vessel three-quarters full of water heated to 300 F., by 
which it was heated and mixed with steam. The heat of the 
latter was absorbed by the air during its expansion, first to a 
working pressure which could be regulated by the driver, and 
then to atmospheric pressure in the cylinders. At Nantes the 
average cost for three years of propelling a car holding thirty- 
four persons was about 6d. per mile. Owing to the heat losses 
in compressing the air, and other considerable losses incident to 
its use, the compressed-air systems of traction have been found 
inefficient and have nearly all been replaced by the more flexible 
and efficient electric motor. 

Cable Traction. — Moving steel cables, propelled by steam 
engines, have been used for traction. The street railway cars 
running from New York to Brooklyn, over the Brooklyn Bridge, 
were for many years propelled by a cable to or from which the 
cars could be attached or detached at will, and, though electric 
motors are now used on this line, the cables are still kept in 
place as a reserve in case of breakdown of the electrical system, 
and are used whenever an accident to the electrical plant occurs. 
Before the advent of electric traction, the tramways using cable 
propulsion were numerous and of great size, as at San Francisco, 
Chicago, Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia and New York 
in America, at Highgate Hill (London) and Edinburgh in the 
United Kingdom, and at Melbourne in Australia. The Glasgow 
Subway is so equipped. 

In the usual form, the motive power is transmitted from astation- 
ary engine by a rope of steel wire running always in one direction, 
up one track and down the other, in a tube 
midway between the rails, on pulleys (fig. 4) 
which are arranged so as to suit curves 
and changes of gradient as well as straight 
and level lines. Over the rope is a slot f in. 
wide, in which travels a flat arm of steel 
connecting the dummy car with the gripper 
(fig. £) which grasps the cable. The flat 
arm is in three pieces, the two outer ones 
constituting a frame which carries the lower 
-j-, r . jaw of the gripper, with grooved rollers at 

' 4-— ^ross-section each end of it, over which the cable runs when 
ot Cable Koad. ^ the gripper is not in action. The upper jaw 
is carried by the middle piece which slides within the outer frame, 
and can be depressed by a lever or screw, pressing the cable first 
on the rollers and then on the lower jaw until it is firmly held : The 
speed of the cable, which is generally 8 to 10 m. an hour, is thus 
imparted to the car gradually and without jerk. The arrangements 
for passing the pulleys, for changing the dummy and cars from one 
line to the other at the end of the road, for keeping the cable 
uniformly taut, and for crossings and junctions with other lines, are 
of considerable ingenuity. When the cars are cast off from the cable 
they must be stopped by hand brakes which, on steep gradients 
especially, must be of great power.

Gasolene Engine Traction. — Explosive engines using gasolene 
(petrol) have been used for motive power, and this is the 
principal form employed 
in the road motor car. 
Certain railways in Eng- 
land and America have 
experimented with cars 
having a gasolene engine 
placed in one end to 
propel the car, the greater 
part of which is left clear 
for the accommodation of 
passengers. These cars 
are intended for short 
runs and may in effect be 
classed as belonging to ex- 
tended tramway service. 
They have yielded en- 
couraging results. 

Electric Traction . — 
Electric traction, as 
treated here, will refer to 
the operation of vehicles 
for the transportation of 
passengers and goods 
upon tracks, as distin- 
guished from what are 
known as telpherage sys- 
tems on the one hand 
(see Conveyors), and 
automobiles intended to 
run on common roads on 
the other (see Motor 
Vehicles). 

Possibly the first elec- 
tric motor was that made 
by the Abbe Salvatore 

dal Negro in Italy in 1830. As early as 1835, Thomas Daven- 
port, a blacksmith of Brandon, Vermont, U.S.A., constructed 
and exhibited an automobile electric car, operated by batteries 
carried upon it. Robert Davidson, of Aberdeen, Scotland, 
began experimenting about 1838 with the" electric motor as 
a means of traction, and constructed a very powerful engine, 
weighing five tons and carrying a battery of forty cells. This 
locomotive made several successful trips on Scottish railways, 
but was finally wrecked by jealous employes of the railway 
while it was lying in the car sheds at Perth. In 1840 a pro- 
visional patent was granted in England to Henry Pinkus, which 
described a method of supplying electric energy to a moving 
train from fixed conductors. A little later, in 1845, French and 
Austrian patents granted to Major Alexander Bessolo described 
practically what is to-day the third-rail system. In 1847 
Professor Moses G. Fanner, of Maine, U.S.A., built a model 
locomotive operated by electricity, which he exhibited at Dover, 
New Hampshire, and later at other places in New England. 
Shortly afterwards Professor C. G. Page, of the Smithsonian 
Institution in Washington, constructed an electric railway 
motor, which made a trip on the 29th of April i8sr, from 
Washington, D.C., to Bladensburg, Maryland, over the Baltimore 
& Ohio railway. This machine carried 100 Grove's cells, and 
attained speeds as high as 19 m. an hour. Perhaps the beginning 
of modern electric traction may be said to date from 1879, when 
the firm of Siemens & Halske put in operation the first electric 
railway at the Industrial Exposition in Berlin. In America it 
was not until a year later that real work began and T. A. Edison 
built an experimental line near his laboratory in Menlo Park, 
New Jersey. In 1880 a locomotive driven by accumulators 
was constructed and operated at a linen-bleaching establishment 
at Breuil-en-Auge, in France; and in 1881 a similar car was 
worked upon the Vincennes tramway line. On the 12th of May 
1 88 1 the first commercial electric railway for regular service 
was opened for operations at Lichterfelde, in Germany. The 



TRACTION 



121 



first really noteworthy road was that constructed in 1883 at the 
Giant's Causeway at Portrush, in the north of Ireland. This 
line was 6 m. long, and the power was obtained from turbine 
wheels actuated by a cascade on the river Rush. The method of 
supply was, curiously enough, the third rail. 

In 1883 invention in electric railways seems to have taken 
a decided advance in America. It was in this year that the 
conflicting interests of Edison and S. D. Field were consolidated; 
and at the same time C. J. van Depoele and Leo Daft began their 
experimental work, which later resulted in numerous commercial 
railways. Next year E. H. Bentley and Walter Knight opened 
to the public in Cleveland, Ohio, U.S.A., a railway operated by 
an open-slot conduit, and for the first time worked in competition 
with horse traction on regular street railway lines. For the next 
two years much experimental work was done, but it may be 
said with fairness that the first of the thoroughly modern 
systems, in which a large railway was equipped and operated 
under service conditions by electricity, was the line built in 
Richmond, Virginia, U.S.A., by Frank J. Sprague in 1887. This 
railway had 13 m. of track, and started with an equipment of 
forty cars. It has been in continuous and successful commercial 
operation ever since. The original Richmond system was in 
all its essential particulars the overhead trolley system now in 
use. Many improvements have been made in the construction 
of the motors, the controllers, the trolleys and the various 
details of car equipment and overhead construction, but the 
broad principles have not been departed from. The success of 
the Richmond line called the attention of tramway managers to 
the advantages of electricity as a motive power, and its substitu- 
tion for other systems progressed with astonishing rapidity. 

The pioneer application of electricity to heavy electric traction 
was that of the Baltimore & Ohio railway tunnel at Baltimore, 
Md., U.S.A., and the system was put into operation in 1895. 
This tunnel is about ij m. in length and passes under the 
city of Baltimore. Its route made the expense of ventilation 
prohibitive, and the smoke and gases from the locomotives 
made the use of the tunnel impossible without ventilation. 
The management therefore decided to attempt the use of 
electric locomotives to haul the trains through, despite the 
fact that there existed no prior applications of heavy electric 
motors for even far lighter service than that demanded by the 
, conditions, namely, the propulsion of trains of over 2000 tons 
up a grade of 42 ft. to the mile. The engineering work and 
designing of the locomotives were undertaken by Dr Louis 
Duncan. The locomotives weigh 96 tons and have worked 
successfully since they were first put into commission. The 
electric service has been extended 6 m. from the mouth of the 
tunnel, making a total haul of nearly 8 m. for these locomotives. 
In 1907 many heavy electric locomotives using continuous 
current were constructed for the New York Central & Hudson 
River Railroad Company to operate a distance of about 5 m. from 
the New York terminus, and others for practically the same 
service, but using single-phase alternating currents, were put in 
for the New York, New Haven & Hartford Railroad Company. 

It has been fully demonstrated that electricity is superior 
to its competitors — horses and moving cables — for tramway 
work. It is cheaper and more flexible. The relative cost of 
operation varies with the local conditions, but a fair average 
estimate would be that cable lines cost 25% more to operate 
than electric, and horse lines 100% more. The increased speed 
of the electric cars and the comfort rendered possible by larger 
vehicles always increase the receipts when horse traction is 
replaced by electric, while the latter, as compared with the 
cable, allows better and easier control of the car and a much 
greater possible speed variation. The installation of an overhead 
electric line costs less than a cable system, though the expense 
of a conduit electric line is about the same. By the extension 
of the urban tramway systems into the suburbs and the construc- 
tion of inter-urban lines, electricity has come into competition 
with steam. Here the conditions are different. For ordinary 
suburban service, the electric cars, running through the city 
streets and on the highways, cannot, in speed, compete with 



steam trains operated on private rights of way. The fact that 
they run more frequently and can take up passengers anywhere 
along the line gives them an advantage, and within limited 
distances they have taken a large proportion of suburban traffic 
from steam railways. For long-distance service, in order to 
compete with steam a speed much greater than that used on 
ordinary tram-lines must be adopted, while owing to the time 
spent on the car more attention must be paid to the comfort 
of the passenger. Speed and comfort being equal, the great 
advantage of electricity is that, when it is used, the most 
economical way of transporting a given number of passengers 
between two points is in a larger number of small trains; with 
steam the converse is true. A frequent service is a great 
attraction to passengers. 

For freight service, especially on railways having heavy 
grades, electricity also possesses many advantages, due princi- 
pally to the peculiarity of the electric locomotive, which admits 
of its maintaining its tractive effort or so-called " draw-bar 
pull " when running at relatively high speeds. This steam loco- 
motives cannot do. Thus a steam locomotive weighing 100 tons 
may exert a draw-bar pull of say 45,000 lb at a speed of 6 m. per 
hour, while at 1 5 m. per hour the continuous draw-bar pull will 
not exceed about 25,000 lb. On the other hand, an electric 
locomotive weighing 75 tons and having a tractive effort of 
34,000 lb at 6 m. per hour will exert a pull of about 27,000 lb. 
at 25 m. per hour. From this it is clear that an electric locomo- 
tive may pull a heavier train at a fair speed than can a larger 
steam locomotive. This admits of more rapid movement of 
freight trains, and thus decreases the hauling cost. Another 
advantage the electric system has for freight service is the 
ability to couple several light locomotives in tandem, all under 
the control of one driver, and thus pull at a high speed larger 
trains than may now be drawn by steam locomotives of weights 
commercially admissible. - Also, these lighter motors distribute 
the weight over the track instead of having it concentrated on a 
few wheels, and the heavy pounding due to the latter condition 
is obviated and the maintenance of the track and bridges reduced. 
Other savings arise from diminished fuel consumption, elimina- 
tion of water and coal stations with their attendants, and greatly 
reduced repairs on motive power. The chief disadvantage 
is the stoppage of all trains on a section if the source of current 
supply should fail. With proper precautions in design and 
construction this should be a remote possibility, and since 
electric rail haulage, in any form attempted up to the present, 
has shown a reduced cost for a given service as compared 
with steam traction, it is not improbable that the future will 
witness great activity in the change from steam to electricity 
for long-distance railway work. 

Systems of electric traction may be divided broadly into two 
classes, the one employing continuous, the other alternating 
currents to drive the motors. Both of these classes may be 
further divided with reference to the conducting system 
employed between the source of current and the motor. The 
system may also be divided according to operative units into 
three classes — the single car, the train pulled by one or more 
directly controlled locomotives or motor cars, and the train 
operated by two or more motor cars under a common secondary 
control. This last is called the " multiple unit system." 

Continuous-Current Systems. — The applications of continuous 
current to electric traction* comprise s\x principal varieties, with 
numerous modifications and combinations. In all of them the 
motors are operated under a constant, or approximately constant, 
potential difference. The system in which cars were connected in 
series by automatic switches, in limited use in the United States 
in 1888 and 1889, has now disappeared, and the parallel system 
of connexion, in which the cars are bridged across between the 
two conductors of a parallel system, maintained at a substantially 
constant voltage, has become practically universal. 

The overhead conductor and track-return construction is the 
standard for^ street railway work in most of the cities Q ver head 
where electric traction is employed, though there are coostruo 
some notable exceptions. In its present development the . 
system may be said to have grown out of the work of ? tt * 
Sprague in Richmond in 1887. Over the track is suspended a bare 



122 



TRACTION 



wire, generally of hard-drawn copper, known as the trolley wire. The 
normal practice is to use a wire not less than 0-325 of an inch in 
diameter to assure permanence, since smaller wires wear out rapidly 
from the friction of the trolley and the burning of the surfaces of 
contact. The wire is usually of circular cross-section. Sometimes 
wires of other sections have been used, notably one having a cross- 
section similar to the figure 8, but the advantage of these forms is 
problematical, while the difficulty attending their proper installation 
is considerable. In some cases the working-conductor, or trolley 
wire, is suspended at one side of the track, connexion with it being 

'made by a side-bearing trolley, but its usual place is directly over 
the track, as this arrangement leads to simpler and more efficient 
construction of the trolleys and their accessory parts. For certain 
special cases, where very large currents are employed, the overhead 
conductor is made of bar metal or structural.shapes. In the Boston 
(Massachusetts) subway, where the traffic is very heavy, a bar of 
rectangular section is used, supported at frequent intervals from 
the roof. In the Baltimore & Ohio railway tunnel at Baltimore, 
Md., the steel working-conductor originally consisted of two Z 
bars forming a trough, the current being collected by an iron shoe, 
but this form has been replaced by a sectional third rail. But what- 
ever the nature of the conductor, it is usually insufficient to carry 
the current necessary for the operation of the system ^ without 
excessive loss. Recourse is therefore had to feeders or reinforcing 
conductors. These may be of any form, but are most frequently 
copper wires or cables of large section, connected at intervals of 
a few hundred feet to the working-conductor. They are sometimes 
carried on poles, but municipal ordinances frequently require their 
installation in underground conduits. In general, it is customary 
to divide the working-conductor into sections of from 1000 to 5000 ft. 
in length, insulated from one another and fed separately through 

* manual or automatic cut-out switches, so that an accident causing 
a short-circuit or break in continuity on one section will not impair 
the operation of others. 

In ordinary street railway construction two methods of suspending 
the trolley wire are in vogue. The most usual construction is to hang 
it from insulators attached to transverse wires running between pairs 
of poles set on opposite sides of the track. Bracket arms attached 
to poles are often used, especially on suburban lines; they arc 
frequently double, or T-shaped, and placed between the two tracks 
of a double-track line. In the standard construction for either 
variety of suspension, the insulators are bell-shaped, and composed 
of some hard moulded or vitreous material. The trolley wire is 
supported by a clamp about 9 in. long, which embraces about 
three-quarters of its circumference. This clamp is usually made 
of bronze, and is now generally fastened to the trolley wire by a 
screw, causing the two parts of the clamp to close upon the wire 
as would the jaws of a vice, or is automatic, clamping the wire the 
more tightly as the strain upon it increases. It was formerly con- 
sidered expedient to solder the wire into the clamp, but this practice 
is now generally abandoned. The insulating bell is so designed 
that its material is subjected only to compression stresses by the 
weight of the wire. It is provided at its upper part with a single 
catch for attachment to the transverse wire or to the bracket arm. 
If a span wire is used it is fastened to the poles, there being turn- 
buckles to tighten it, while a strain insulator on either side gives 
a double insulation between the trolley wire and the poles. With 
a bracket construction it was formerly the custom to attach the 
insulator directly to the bracket arm, but the blow of the trolley 
wheel broke great numbers of insulators, and it has therefore become 
the, practice to adopt some more flexible method of attachment, 
a number of different forms being in use. The poles between which 
the span wires are stretched, or to which the bracket arms are 
attached, are of wood or iron. They are firmly set in the ground, 
usually with concrete. 

Another form of overhead construction for high speed service, 
brought out by the Westinghouse Company and known as the 
Catenary "Catenary" system^ (fig. 6), is designed to ^ hold the 
Construe* contact or trolley wire in a horizontal position above 
Hon. t hc track* without any dip or sag. Essentially it is 




Fig. 6. — Single Catenary Line, 
made up of a supporting cable made of stranded galvanized steel 
wire -fa in. in diameter wnich is firmly fastened to brackets attached 
to the supporting poles and from which the trolley wire is suspended 



by means of rigid iron hangers spaced about 10 ft. apart. A proper 
sag is given the supporting cable, and the lengths of tne hangers vary 
so that the trolley wire is held horizontal without sag. The con- 
struction resembles a single supporting cable and suspended chord 
of a suspension bridge. The trolley wire, the hangers and the sus- 
pension cable are all mechanically connected together and in metallic 
contact, so that the whole system acts as a conductor. The support- 
ing cable is held by insulators at the points where it is supported 
on the brackets at^ the poles. For heavy work there the currents 
taken by the passing cars and locomotives are great, requiring a 
very large trolley wire, two supporting cables are strung from pole 
to pole and the trolley wire suspended below and between the two. 




Fig. 7. — Double Catenary Line. 



In this case the hangers are triangular in form and hung with the 
apex of the triangle downward. The two upper angles are fastened 
to the pair of supporting cables, while to the lower angle is attached 
the trolley wire. This arrangement is called the " double catenary " 
construction (fig. 7). 

In order to provide a proper return path for the current, the track 
must be made electrically continuous. This is accomplished by 
bonding the individual lengths of rail together in some R .. 
way, or by actually welding them together to form B on ai a v 
a continuous length. There are many types of rail- ** 

bonding. In most of them holes are drilled in the ends of adjacent 
rails, and a copper conductor inserted between them, its ends being 
in some way forced against the walls of the holes. I11 one type the 
bond is in the form of a hollow cylinder, the ends of which are inserted 
in the holes in the rails, a tapered steel pin being driven in so as to 
expand the cylinder out against the rail. In another form the end* 
of the bond is a solid cylinder, which is upset by hydraulic pressure, 
forcing it against the rail. A semi-plastic amalgam of mercury 
has been used to give a contact between the adjacent rails and the 
fish-plate connecting them. The most usual practice is to use a 
short bond covered and protected by the fish-plates. Tracks used 
for a return circuit are cross-bonded at intervals. If the track 
return has too great an electrical resistance it is reinforced by 
conductors connected to it at intervals and extending back to the 
power-house. Neglect to provide a proper return circuit has often 
caused a great loss of energy, and, in many places, excessive electro- 
lytic action on iron pipes, cable sheaths and other metallic bodies 
buried in the earth. The lightning arresters provided on overhead 
lines are placed on the poles at intervals determined by the location 
of the line. 

In a few places the municipal authorities, in order to avoid the 
disturbances on telephone lines due to the fluctuation of a trolley 
current, and the electrolysis of gas and water pipes which 
may arise from a grounded return, have required the 
erection of a double overhead system. In this each ^ 
track has two trolley wires forming a complete metallic circuit. 
The largest system or this kind is in Cincinnati, Ohio, U.S.A., where 
there are over 225 m. of tram-lines. The system has the advantages 
to which it owes its existence, but the multiplicity of wires at 
crossings, right-angle turnouts and switches is so complicated 
that automatic switching cannot be attempted. The man in charge 
of the car removes the double trolley from the wires at such points, 
and replaces it when they arc passed. The construction adopted, 
except in respect to the points mentioned, is practically similar to 
that already described for the track-return system. _ 

A number of patents have been granted in various countries for 
electric traction systems in which one or both of the fixed conductors" 
are installed in a conduit underground, communication open*slot 
being had with them by means of an open slot, into conduit 
which projects a current-taking device of some nature 
carried by the car as it moves along. A system of this character 
was installed at Blackpool, England, in 1885, and later one was very 
successfully operated in Budapest. The first large and important

Trolley. 



TRACTION 



123 



installation of this character to be made was in Washington, D.C., 
U.S.A., where a considerable system of street railways was changed 
from horse operation to this new method. The success of this 
system, and of experiments made on Lenox Avenue, in New York 
City, led to the construction of many miles of railways of the conduit 
type in the latter city. It is also used extensively in London. 
(For details of the construction of the conduits, see Tramway.) 
This system is much more expensive to install than the overhead 
trolley system, but experience has shown that it can be as economi- 
cally operated. Most of the troubles that have occurred have been 
due to lack of experience, but on the whole they have not been more 
serious than those experienced with overhead systems. 

The great expense of the open conduit has led numerous inventors 
to bring out systems of operating electric railways by means of 
rf closed conduits or sectional third rails, in which the 
edit working-conductor is laid on the surface of the ground 
conduit. between the rails, and is connected with the source of 
current only as the car passes over each section. In this way the 
immediate section or portion of the working-conductor under the 
car is electrically active, but other sections are not, and all danger 
to the passage of street traffic is removed. Up to 1900, nearly one 
thousand patents for this type of street railway construction, known 
also as the " surface contact " system, had been granted by the 
United States patent office alone. So far the system has been 
introduced in but few places, but its performance has been more 
than promising, and it is thought that it will be more extensively 
adopted in the future. Among the more important railways at 
present equipped with it may be mentioned one in Paris, using 
the Diatto system, and one at Monte Carlo, where the Westing- 
house system is installed. In both these the current is supplied 
by means of " buttons " or metallic disks laid flush with the surface 
of the street between the tracks, and connected through switches 
to a working-conductor. Under the car is installed a current- 
taking device in the shape of a long runner or skate, which runs 
over the buttons and is appropriately connected with a storage 
battery on the car, so that when it touches one of the buttons 
current is sent from the battery through a system of electro-magnets 
operating the switches which connect that particular button to 
the feeding system, and thus the runners are enabled to receive 
current for the operation of the motors on the car. The various 
systems differ in the method of connecting the contact rail or 
button with the live conductors; in some a magnet on the car works 
a mechanism to make the desired contact, in others a current 
from batteries on the car actuates a switch located near the track. 
(See Tramway.) 

The third-rail system, which is a development of the overhead 
trolley and track-return system, has been applied to several large 
Third // anc * i m P or tant railway installations, especially in the 
Thira-raii United States, and in the prolongation of the Orleans 
system. ra ;j way ; n Paris from the Place Valhubert to the 
new station at the Quai d'Orsay. Its name almost sufficiently 
indicates its method of operation. A rail similar to the track-rails 
is laid upon insulators and forms the working-conductor. On the 
elevated railways in New York, Brooklyn, Boston and Chicago 
and the subway in New York, a pressure of about 600 volts is 
used between this rail and the track-rails which form the return 
circuit. Contact is made with the third rail by means of a bronze 
or cast-iron shoe, either resting upon the rail by its own weight, 
or pressed down upon it by springs. This is generally attached 
to some part of the truck of the car in preference to any part of the 
body of the car, so as to avoid any vibration or swaying due to the 
movement of the body upon its springs. The third-rail system 
has been adopted in many instances where large and powerful 
trains are to be operated on private rights of way, but it is nowhere 
in use for electric traction upon highways or in streets where there 
is any passing of foot passengers or vehicles. An excellent example 
of such construction may be found in the Albany & Hudson 
railroad, which connects the city of Albany with the city of Hudson, 
in New York state. Here the length of the road is about 32 m., 
the track being of standard gauge and laid with a 60-lb T-rail. 
A T-rail of the same size, raised about 1 ft. above the level of the 
running-rails, is used for the electrical conductor, and is installed 
on insulators situated 5 ft. apart on the ends of the cross-ties. 
All these rails are well bonded with copper bonds at the joints. 
At road crossings, which on this railroad are at grade, the third 
rail is omitted for, a distance nearly equal to the length of a train. 
Appropriate cast-iron shoes, fixed to the trucks of the front and 
rear cars of a train, bridge the space, so that the forward shoes are 
running on the rail past the break before the rear shoes leave it. 
Upon this railroad motors of considerable size and power are used, 
and both passengers and freight in their original cars, as received 
from connecting steam railways, are transported. Other examples 
of third-rail construction occur in the extension of the Baltimore & 
Ohio railway tunnel at Baltimore, the New York Central Railway 
Company's New York terminal, the underground systems of the 
City & South London railway, the Waterloo & City railway, and the 
Central London railway in London, and the Versailles division of the 
Western railway of France. In some cases, as on the Metropolitan, 
the District, and several of the " tube " railways in London, the 
running-rails are not used for the return circuit, which is 



completed by a fourth rail similar to the conductor rail, laid 
outside the track. 

One of the oldest forms of electric traction is by accumulators. 
In brief, its principle is that storage batteries, or accumulators, are 
carried on the car, which becomes a veritable automobile. Accumula* 
It has been the usual practice to instal about 80 cells, t 
giving a pressure of 160 to 175 volts at the motors; 
these are recharged after the car has run about 25 m. In general, 
the accumulators are not charged in place, but the car is supplied 
with a new set, fully charged, at the end of a run of about the length 
mentioned. The system has been installed in a very large number 
of places in Europe and America, but has never shown the gratify- 
ing commercial success which the direct-conduction systems 
exhibit, on account of the high cost and depreciation of storage 
batteries. In some places, notably in Hanover, Germany, where 
legislative ordinances have forbidden the overhead conducting 
system in city streets, a combination has been used whereby accumu- 
lator cars run in the city districts from the energy stored in their 
batteries, and in the suburbs operate directly as overhead trolley 
cars, the batteries being charged at the same time from the over- 
head system. 

Alternating Current Systems. — Alternating current systems are 
now being used, both single-phase and three-phase. In the former 
case the newly-developed single-phase motors, later to ~- - 
be described, are employed, while with three-phase ^°vP«ase. 
systems induction motors are used. The polyphase current is 
much used as a means of .distributing energy from a central power- 
station over extended lines of railways, but is generally converted 
into direct current through the agency of rotary converters, and 
fed to the lines as such. There are, however, a few railways working 
directly with induction motors upon a three-phase system of supply. 
Prominent among these may be mentioned the Valtellina railway 
in Italy and the Jungfrau railway in Switzerland. Upon these 
lines the rails are used as one of the three conductors, and two 
trolley wires are suspended above the track. The locomotive is 
provided with two trolleys, one running upon each wire, and con- 
sists simply of an induction motor coupled through appropriate 
gearing to the mechanism of the truck. For starting a large 
resistance is introduced into the rotor or secondary circuit of the 
motors by means of collecting rings placed on its shaft, upon which 
bear brushes. This resistance is cut out as the speed increases, 
until it is all withdrawn and the rotor is short-circuited, when full 
speed is attained. ^ It has been found that potential differences 
of about 500 volts in each phase can be safely handled, and it is 
claimed that the few railways which use polyphase currents have 
shown gratifying results in practice. 

In the early years of the 20th century single-phase alternating 
current motors for electric traction were developed, and single- 
phase systems were extensively installed both in Europe c; / . 
and in America. The simplest type of single-phase nhase' 
motor is a series motor provided with the usual commu- 
tator and brushes, in which the current passes through both the 
field coils and the armature coils. The armature and field windings 
being traversed by the same current, the reversal of the field magne- 
tization and that of the direction of current flow in the armature 
are coincident, so that the turning effort or torque, on the armature 
current produced by the interaction of armature and field magne- 
tization is always in the same direction. Since the alternating current 
passes through both members of the motor, the armature and field 
cores are both laminated. In the later types of these motors the 
field coils are distributed and embedded in the field ring, so that the 
inner surface of the field ring presents a practically smooth surface 
to the armature. Troubles were at first experienced with commu- 
tation of the heavy alternating currents required for the operation 
of these motors, vicious sparking taking place at the brushes. 
This was overcome by the use of auxiliary or "compensating" 
coils, which are embedded in the field magnet ring, being placed 
between successive magnet coils. These compensating coils are 
usually connected in series with the main armature and field circuit. 
They may each, however, have^ their two ends joined together, 
(short-circuited), the currents in them being induced by the 
alternating magnetic flux of the fields. 

Motors of the above types have the general characteristics of 
direct current series motors, and possess the same general relations 
between speed and torque that are such an important element in 
the success of direct current series motors. The efficiency of alter- 
nating current motors is not quite so good as that of direct current 
motors, on account of the rapid reversal of the iron magnetization 
in the field magnets, but their efficiency is high and their perform- 
ance in practical work has been excellent (fig. 8). 

There is another type of single-phase motor that has been used 
in Europe, but not in America, which is commonly called the repul- 
sion motor. In these motors the armature is not directly included 
in the main circuit, but opposite points on the commutator are 
connected together through brushes. The working current is fed 
to the field magnets, and the rapid reversals of magnetization induce 
currents in the armature coils, which currents, working with the field 
magnetization, cause rotation. Several types of repulsion motors 
have been developed, and in general their characteristics are similar 
to those of the plain series type. They have not, however, come 



124

into extended commercial use. Single-phase motors for a given 
power are much larger, heavier and more expensive than the ordinary 
direct current motors, owing to the low magnetic densities at which 
the iron is worked. The power factor is between 0*75 and 0*85.

The advantages of the single-phase alternating system He in the fact 
that it combines the simplicity of the overhead direct current con- 
struction with the possibility of exceedingly high voltage. Where 
heavy traffic is to be handled, and especially where that traffic is 
scattered, a direct current system, which up to the present has been 
limited in its voltage, is not commercially possible, as the amount of 
copper used for distribution and the excessive amount of apparatus 
required to convert high tension alternating current into low tension 
direct current, would make the cost prohibitive. In direct current

systems for lines of any length, it is the custom to use alternating 
current of high potential and to reduce it to direct current of low 
potential at different points along the line. This involves rotary 
converters, which by their nature require attendance in the sub- 
stations, while if the traffic is scattered so that the load on the sub- 



stations may at times be zero, and at other times may be verylarge, 
the capacity of the sub-stations must be equal to handling a maxi- 
mum load, so that the total capacity of each sub-station would be 
based on the maximum instead of on an average condition. With 
the single-phase alternating current system, on the contrary, only 
static transformers in sub-stations along the line are required, and 
with the high voltages available (voltages as high as 11,000 volts are 
used at present) the distances between these sub-stations can be 
greatly increased as compared with the direct current sub-stations, 
so that each sub-station feeding a much longer portion of the 
line would have a better average load than in the direct current 
case. The static transformers do not require attendance, and their 
efficiency is much higher than that of the rotary converters. 

Electric motors for traction purposes have been highly elaborated 
and developed. At first they drove the car axles through belts or 
sprocket chains, the motor being sometimes attached M 
to the car, sometimes to the truck. At Richmond, ' Wo ' ors ' 
however, in 1887, the Sprague method of communicating the power 
from the motor axle to the car axle was put into practical operation, 
and this has with slight modifications been retained. It consists 
of sleeving one end of the motor on the axle, suspending the other

flexibly from the car body or truck, and driving from the armature 
through spur gearing. At first the motors were too small for the 
work demanded of them. Their high speed required a double 
reduction in gearing, their overheating caused continual burn-outs, 
and the sparking at the commutators necessitated constant repairs. 
These defects were gradually eliminated. The motors were made 
larger, the quality of the iron and insulation was greatly improved, 
and finally a four-pole motor requiring only a single-speed reduction 
by spur-gearing was produced. Since that time further improve- 
ments in material and design have been introduced, and the present 
motor has been evolved. Almost all the standard modern traction 
motors are of the same general design. , They are series wound, i.e. 
the same current passes through both the armature and the fields. 
This gives a strong starting torque or tractive effort, the torque 
diminishing as the speed increases. This characteristic is particu- 
larly suitable for, traction. Fig. 9 shows the relation between speed 
and tractive effort of a standard railway motor of large size and 
power. The armature is built up of carefully tested iron disks, 
which are deeply slotted to make room for the coils. These are 
wound and insulated separately, and placed in the slots in the 
armature core; sometimes they are held in place by binding wire, 
sometimes by wedges. The commutator is put in place, the coil 
connexions soldered to it, and the proper end-coverings put on. 
The magnet frame is made in two parts, of cast steel, enclosing the 
entire armature. A lid in the top casting gives access to the 
brushes, which are of carbon. The field coils are wound on forms 
and properly insulated. When in operation it is practically water

and dust proof, and with proper attention is a very durable piece 
of machinery (fig. 10). Although the standard^ design of motors 
is at present based on a single-reduction gearing, there are in 
operation traction-motors which are not geared. 

On the locomotives used on the New York Central, the New York, 
New Haven & Hartford, and the Baltimore & Ohio railways in 
America, the City & South London railway in England, the 
armatures surround the driving axles. In all the cases mentioned, 
except the Baltimore & Ohio railway, the armatures are set 
directly on and solid with the axles of the driving-wheels, while on 
the Baltimore & Ohio locomotives the motors are sleeved on the 
axles, there being a slight play between the sleeve and the axle, 
which allows a flexible support. The wheels are driven by arms 
projecting from the armature shaft. 

There is no fixed method of rating the output of traction-motors. 
Most manufacturers, in giving a certain horse-power capacity, 
mean that at the given rating the motor will run an hour with a rise 
in temperature of a certain number of degrees, not that it can be run 
continuously at the power given. Another system of rating depends 
on the draw-bar pull which the motor can develop under normal 
conditions of voltage and speed. Uniformity is greatly needed. 

One of the most important parts of the equipment of an electric 
car or locomotive is the controlling device. In the early days of 
Co troll rs e ^ ect " c traction a number of different methods of regulat- 

a e 'ing the speeds of the cars were used, but they have been 
reduced to practically one standard method. In the old Sprague 
system there were at first no resistances outside of the motors them- 
selves, but the field coils of the motors were divided into sections, 
and by changing the relative connexions of these sections the total 
resistance of the circuit could be changed; at the same time the 
strength of the field for a given total current was either increased 




Fig. 11. — Controller (open), 
or decreased. In other systems the fields and armatures of the 
motors were not changed in their relation to one another, but exter- 
nal resistances were cut out and in by the controller. Usually there 
are two motors on each car, and it is evident that if the speedy of a 
car be changed within wide limits, a\[ the other factors remaining 
constant, there will be a very considerable loss by either of these 
methods of regulating, unless the relative connexions of the motor 
armatures can be changed. This can^ be done py putting the two 
motors in series where low speed is desired, and in parallel where the 
speed is to be increased. This method was tried in the early days 
of electric traction at Richmond, and discarded, but it has been again 
taken up, and is now the standard method of regulation in ordinary 
tramway work. Roughly speaking, when the»car is started the 
controller connects the two motors in series with an external resist- 
ance, then cuts out the external resistance, then breaks the circuit, 
then connects the two motors in parallel. The external resistance 
is put again in series with them, and then is gradually cut out as 
the car speed increases. By this method a considerable range of 
speed is attained at a fair efficiency. The controller (fig. 11) consists 
of a cylinder having on it a number of copper segments so arranged 
that on rotating it different connexions are made between stationary 
fingers that bear on these segments. In the first types much diffi- 
culty was experienced from the burning of the segments and fingers, 
due to the sparking on breaking the circuit, but this has been to a 
large extent obviated by using magnetic blow-outs at the point of 
break. (A magnetic blow-out is simply a magnet so arranged that 
the arc caused by breaking the circuit takes place in the magnetic 
field,) There is a reversing lever on the controllers separate from 
the controller handle, and interlocking with the controller so that 
the reverse lever may not be moved except when the controller is in 
the "off" position. 



When it is desired to run trains of cars and to accelerate them 
rapidly, it is sometimes necessary to have more than one car 
equipped with motors. In this case all the motors must be controlled 
from one point, and a number of ingenious devices have been 
evolved to accomplish such " multiple control." In general, each 
car has its own controller, and all the controllers are operated by 
electric power from switches on each platform of any of the motor 
cars. 

A motor and controlling system designed to save and utilize the 
power produced by a car running down an incline has been developed 
and is termed the " regenerative system." A car run- n eeettera „ 
ning over a line having heavy grades must have sufficient t^controU 
energy given to it to overcome its frictional resistance 
to motion and also to lift the weight of car and load from the 
bottom to top of each up-grade. On the return trip, the car 
" coasts " or runs down the grade without the consumption of 
current, but is restrained from attaining too high a speed by the 
brakes, thus wasting the energy existing by reason of the position of 
the car. 

With the regenerative system the motors are caused to act as 
dynamos which are driven by the motion of the car axles when 
descending a grade, and, as they are connected to the line by the 
trolley or contacting device, the current thus generated is fed to the 
line and may assist other cars climbing grades at some other point 
on the system. The delivery of electrical energy also puts a resis- 
tance on the car axles and produces a braking effect which almost 
automatically fixes the car speed. If the speed be too high, the 
excessive current generated will tend to retard the car and reduce 
its velocity, while if too low the small current produced will set up 
but little opposition to motion and the car will accelerate. 

Obviously, series motors cannot be used for this service. The 
motors have shunt fields, and their speed is varied by varying the 
field strength. Motors of this type are larger, more costly and 
slightly less efficient than series machines, so that a regenerative 
system has no place on roads that have a fairly level contour. 
When, however, the grades are frequent and excessive, the power 
saved more than counterbalances these factors, and the system may 
prove a valuable one for such service. 

For tramcars of ordinary sizes hand-brakes are used, these being 
generally spindle brakes, with leverage enough to handle the com- 
paratively heavy cars. When the size and speed of the 
car increases, however, these hand-brakes do not give ■"'**•"• 
sufficient control, and power brakes have to be adopted. Of these 
there are several forms that have proved successful in practice. 
The one most extensively used in electric railways is the air-brake, 
which is similar in its mechanical operation to the air-brake used on 
steam railways. The compressed air required for the operation of 
the brake is obtained by means of an air-pump driven by an electric " 
motor, the circuit of which is controlled by a switch actuated by the 
pressure of the air in the receiving tank. When this pressure rises 
to a predetermined value, the device acts and interrupts the supply 
of current to the motor, which is thus stopped. When the pressure 
falls below a determined minimum the device operates in the oppo- 
site direction, and the motor and pump start. Of electric brakes 
there are several varieties. One type consists of two iron^ disks, 
one keyed on the axle but capable of moving along it a short distance 
axially, and the other held firmly on the frame of the truck. By 
means of a coil, set in a recess of annular form turned in the face of 
the fixed disk, the disks are magnetized transversely, and are drawn 
together with greater or less pressure, dependent on the amount of 
current that is allowed to pass through the coil. It is customary to 
arrange the current connexions in this form of electric brake so that 
when the handle of the controller is turned beyond the stopping 
position the current is cut off from the source of supply, and the 
motor running as a dynamo furnishes the current to work the 
brake. 

The magnetic track-brake, which is sometimes used on tramway 
cars, consists of a pair of steel shoes, suspended from the truck frame 
and hanging near and over the rail, a steel yoke connecting the two 
shoes together. On this yoke is wound a heavy magnetizing coil 
which, when energized, strongly magnetizes the two steel shoes and 
causes them to draw against and adhere to the track. Bracing links 
connect these track shoes with brake shoes on the wheel rims, and 
the drag of the track shoes thus applies pressure also to the wheel 
shoes. The downward pull of the track shoes gives a greater 
pressure of the wheels against the track than that due to the weight 
of the car, and the sliding or " skidding " of wheels, with the conse- 
quent production of flats, is avoided. A further braking effect comes 
from the use of the motors as dynamos, driven by the motion of the 
car, to supply current to the brake magnetizing coils. This therefore 
is one of the most effective brakes that has^ been devised. It has, 
however, not been very extensively used owing to its high cost and 
difficulties that arise from the track shoes running so close to the 
rails that any uneven places — frogs, switches, crossings and the like — 
may rub against them and give a braking effect at times when the 
car is accelerating or running. A pair of shoes is applied on both 
sides of the car, one pair being hung over either rail. 

Another method of braking is by arranging the connexions^ cf 
the two motors so that one acts as a dynamo driven by the motion 



126

of the car and supplies current to the other, which works as a motor, 
tending to turn the wheels in the direction opposite to that in which 
the car is moving. The production of current by the one motor and 
the reverse effort of the other give a powerful braking effect. The 
proper connexions are made by constructing the controllers with 
contacts additional to those required for motor control, which 
connect the machines in the desired manner when the controller 
handle is moved round past the "off " position. 

Automatic brakes are always preferable to hand-brakes even 
though they cost much more, because the energy required to propel 
an ordinary tramcar is from 10 to 25 % more with hand than with 
automatic brakes. The cause is the constant pressure of the brake 
shoes of a hand brake against the wheel rims, the shoes being so 
held by the operator to avoid having too long a hand movement in 
applying the brake. The maximum pressure possible for any brake 
should be about 90 % of the weight of the car on the braked wheels. 
Less than this amount will give an inefficient brake; more will 
produce sliding or " skidding" of the wheels, producing " flats" on 
them, and also causing loss of retarding effect. 

Of the numerous accessories necessary in the operation of electric 
railways one of the most important is the trolley. For an overhead 
Accessories svstem tn * s consists in general of a metallic rod or tube 
mounted urjon the top of the car and pressed upward 
against the trolley wire by springs. At the upper end of this 
trolley pole is generally placed a bronze wheel which runs along 
the under surface of the wire. On the continent of Europe 
considerable use has been made of bow-trolleys, which consist of 
light metallic bow-shaped structures, sustained in place by^ springs 
and running along on the under side of the wire against which they 
rub. The designs patented for trolleys are almost innumerable. 
Besides the trolleys, cars are ordinarily equipped with switches 
which are used to break the trolley circuit, with fuses or automatic 
circuit-breakers, with electric lamps, with lightning arresters, and 
with the necessary car wiring. The fuses or automatic circuit- 
breakers guard against an excess of current being passed through the 
motors, and when they are fitted the ordinary platform switch can 
be dispensed with. These automatic breakers can be set for any 
' desired current. 

The question of the generation and the distribution of the 
current belongs to this article only in so far as electric traction 
r ra ft on nas introduced peculiarities in the type of apparatus 
ofCurrenL or tne metnoc ^ s °f ^ ts use - * n a continuous current 
station the current is generated at an approximately 
constant potential, varying from 500 volts to 700 volts on 
different systems. As^ the load is apt to fluctuate, except 
in large stations, within wide limits, the machinery must be 
designed to stand the most severe usage. The engines are more 
•massive than would be necessary for constant loads, and the dynamos 
must be built to stand sudden overloads without destructive spark- 
ing; usually, indeed, they are considerably over-compounded, not 
so much for the sake of raising the voltage as to strengthen the field 
and prevent sparking on overload. When a number of machines 
are to be run in parallel — as is usually the case — they are provided 
with " equalizing " switches, which serve to throw the series fields 
in parallel. As a result, if one of the machines tends to increase 
its armature current beyond the proper amount, the current in the 
series fields does not increase with it, but retains its normal propor- 
tion. The armature reaction and resistance fall of potential, m 
this machine, would both tend to increase, thereby decreasing its 
armature potential, and therefore its current would return to ks 
proper value. From the dynamos the current from each machine 
goes through an ammeter and automatic circuit-breaker to the main 
" omnibus"' bars, then through the station ammeter to the feeder 
" omnibus " bars, then through ammeters and circuit-breakers to 
the feed-cables. As a rule, watt-meters are provided to measure 
the output of the station, and, if an overhead system is ^ being 
supplied, lightning arresters are installed. Where continuous 
currents are used to operate cars at considerable distances from the 
generating stations, " boosters " are used. These are series- wound 
dynamos driven at a constant speed, through which is passed the 
current that is to feed the distant section of the line. Usually the 
characteristic of the booster is so calculated that the amount by 
which it raises the voltage for a given current just equals the fall of 
potential in the feeding-line for the same current. The result is 
that the potential at the end of the line will be the same as that at 
the station. The question of economy, as between putting in 
additional copper and wasting energy in the booster, is easily 
calculated; the advantage is more and more on the side of the 
latter as the distance increases and the car service becomes more 
infrequent.^ It is necessary to the satisfactory operation of a 
system that the variations of voltage should not be too great, so 
boosters sometimes become a practical necessity, irrespective of the 
question of economy. 

Accumulators are frequently installed in power stations to prevent 
the heavy load fluctuations which arise from starting and stopping 
of cars and ascending or descending grades. The generators give 
an approximately unvarying amount of current. When the load 
demand is less than that delivered by the generators, the excess 
current goes into the storage battery, and when the load is greater 



than the power from the generators the additional current required 
comes from the battery. The generators, engines and boilers may 
thus be proportioned for the average instead of the maximum load 
requirements, and the sizes of these units are thereby reduced. 

As traction systems have been combined and extended, the area of 
operation of many of the companies has grown so that a number of 
direct-current stations are used for a single system. The limit 
of distance to which electric energy can be economically supplied 
at the comparatively low voltages employed is not great, and the 
advantage of having one or two largestations to supply a system, 
in place of a number of smaller ones, is evident. This fact has led 
to the use of high-potential alternating currents for the distribution 
of energy", the voltage being reduced at the points of consumption, 
and in most cases changed to a continuous current by rotary 
converters. If alternating currents are used for the car motors, the 
economical distribution of energy is greatly simplified, the rotary 
converters being eliminated and their first cost and losses and 
expense of operation saved. The expense of operating sub-stations 
containing rotary converters is necessarily large, and the capital 
outlay required for them is often greater than for the generating 
station. 

As a rule, the cars used for electric traction have varied^ but 
slightly from the type of tramway car prevalent in different localities. 
The tendency, however, has been to increase their size. Cars 
For electric railway work, as distinguished from tram- 
way work, the cars generally follow the pattern that is standard on 
American steam lines. The trucks used for electric cars are made of 
steel, with heavy axles and suspension bars for carrying the electric 
motors. For smaller vehicles, a single four-wheel truck is used, the 
wheel base being limited by the curvature of the track, but not as a 
rule exceeding 7I ft. For the longer and heavier cars, two four- 
wheeled bogie trucks are employed. If two motors are used on a 
double-truck car, and if the grades on the road are very heavy, the 
trucks are made on the " maximum traction " pattern, in which one 
pair of wheels in each truck is of smaller diameter than the other 
and the greater part of the weight of the car is on the larger motor- 
driven wheels. For very large high-speed cars, trucks are used of 
practically the same type and weight as are employed on steam 
railways. (See also Tramway.) (L. Du.) 

TRACY, ANTOINE LOUIS CLAUDE DESTUTT, Comte de 
(1754-1836), French philosopher, son of a distinguished soldier, 
was born in Bourbonnais on the 20th of July 1754. He belonged 
to a noble family of Scotch descent, tracing its origin to Walter 
Stutt, who in 1420 accompanied the earls of Buchan and Douglas 
to the court of France, and whose family afterwards rose to be 
counts of Tracy. He was educated at home and at the univer- 
sity of Strassburg, where he was chiefly noted for his athletic 
skill. He went into the army, and when the Revolution broke 
took an active part in the provincial assembly of Bourbonnais. 
He was elected a deputy of the nobility to the states-general, 
where he sat alongside of his friend La Fayette. In the spring 
of 1792 he received the rank of martchal de camp in command of 
the cavalry in the army of the north; but the influence of the 
extremists becoming predominant he took indefinite leave of 
absence, and settled at Auteuil, where, with Condorcet and 
Cabanis, he devoted himself to scientific studies. Under the 
Reign of Terror he was arrested and imprisoned for nearly a 
year, during which he studied Condillac and Locke, and aban- 
doned the natural sciences for philosophy. On the motion of 
Cabanis he was named associate of the Institute in the class 
of the moral and political sciences. He soon began to attract 
attention by the memoires which he read before his colleagues — 
papers which formed the first draft of his comprehensive work 
on ideology. The society of " ideologists " at Auteuil embraced, 
besides Cabanis and Tracy, Constantin Francois de Chassebceuf, 
Comte de Volney and Dominique Joseph Garat (1 749-1 833), 
professor in the National Institute. Under the empire he was 
a member of the senate, but took little part in its deliberations. 
Under the Restoration he became a peer of France, but protested 
against the reactionary spirit of the government, and remained 
in opposition. In 1808 he was elected a member of the French 
Academy in place of Cabanis, and in 1832 he was also named 
a member of the Academy of Moral Sciences on its reorganization. 
He appeared, however, only once at its conferences, owing to his 
age and to disappointment at the comparative failure of his 
work. He died at Paris on the 9th of March 1836. 

Destutt de Tracy was the last eminent representative of the 
sensualistic school which Condillac (q.v.) founded in France upon a 
one-sided interpretation of Locke. He pushed the sensualistic

principles of Condillac to their last consequences, being in full agree- 
ment with the materialistic views of Cabanis, though the attention 
of the latter was devoted more to the physiological, that of Tracy 
to the psychological or " ideological " side of man. His ideology, 
he frankly stated, formed " a part of zoology," or, as we should say, 
of biology. To think is to feel. The four faculties into which he 
divides the conscious life — perception, memory, judgment, will — 
are all varieties of sensation. Perception _ is sensation caused by a 
present affection of the external extremities of the nerves; memory 
is sensation caused, in the absence of present excitation, by dis- 
positions of the nerves which are the result of past experiences; judg- 
ment is the perception of relations between sensations, and is itself 
a species of sensation, because if we are aware of the sensations we 
must be aware also of the relations between them; will he identifies 
with the feeling of desire, and therefore includes it as a variety of 
sensation. It is easy to see that such conclusions ignore important 
distinctions, and are, indeed, to a large extent an abuse of language. 
As a psychologist de Tracy deserves credit for his distinction between 
active and passive touch, which developed into the theory^ of the 
muscular sense. His account of the notion of external existence, 
as derived, not from pure sensation, but from the experience of 
action on the one hand and resistance on the other, may be compared 
with the account of Bain and later psychologists. 

His chief works are EUments d'idiologie (1817-1818; 2nd ed., 1824- 
1825), in which he presented the complete statement of his earlier 
monographs ; Commeniaire sur V esprit des lots de Montesquieu

TRACY, BENJAMIN FRANKLIN (1830- ), American 
lawyer and soldier, was born in Owego, New York, on the 26th 
of April 1830. He-was educated at the Owego academy, was 
admitted to the bar in 185 1, was district-attorney of Tioga 
county in 1853-1859, and was a member of the state Assembly 
in 1862. In 1862 he organized the 109th and the 137th regiments 
of New York Volunteer Infantry and (Aug. 28) was made colonel 
of the former. In September 1864 he became colonel of the 
127th United States Colored Infantry; in 1864-1865 was in 
command of the prison camp at Elmira, New York, and in 
March 1865 was breveted brigadier-general of volunteers. He 
received a Congressional medal of honour in 1895 for gallantry 
at the Wilderness in May 1864. He was United States district- 
attorney for the eastern district of New York in 1866-1873, and 
an associate judge of the New York court of appeals in 1881- 
1882.- In 1889-1893 he was secretary of the navy in the cabinet 
of President Benjamin Harrison, and then resumed the practice 
of law in New York City. He was chairman of the commission 
which drafted the charter for Greater New York, and in 1897 
was defeated as Republican candidate for mayor of the city. In 
1899 he was counsel for Venezuela before the Anglo-Venezuelan 
boundary arbitration commission in Paris. 

TRADE (O. Eng. trod, footstep, from Iredan, to tread; in 
M. Eng, the forms Ired, Irod and trade appear, the last in the 
sense of a beaten track), originally a term meaning track or 
course, and so surviving in " trade-wind " (q.v.), a wind which 
always blows in one course; hence a way of life, business or 
occupation, and, specifically, the handicraft in which a man 
has been trained and which he makes his means of livelihood, 
or the mercantile business which he carries on for profit, 
as opposed to the liberal arts or professions. A further 
development of meaning makes tbe word synonymous with 
commerce, comprehending every species of exchange or dealing 
in commodities.

Tariffs; Trade Organization; and also the sections dealing with 
trade and commerce under the various countries. 

TRADE, BOARD OF. The greater part of such supervision 
of commerce and industry as exists in the United Kingdom is 
exercised by the " Committee of Privy Council for Trade " or, 
as it is usually called, the board of trade. As early as the 14th 
century councils and commissions had been formed from time 
to time to advise parliament in matters of trade, but it. was not 
till the middle of the 17th century, under the Commonwealth, 
that any department of a permanent character was attempted. 
Cromwell's policy in this respect was continued under the 



Restoration, and in 1660 a committee of the privy council was 
appointed for the purpose of obtaining information as to the 
imports and exports of the country and improving trade. A 
few years^later another committee of the council was appointed 
to act as intermediaries between the crown and the colonies, 
or foreign plantations, as they were then called. This joint 
commission of trade and plantations was abolished in 1675, 
and it was not until twenty years later that it was revived under 
William III. Among the chief objects set before this board were 
the inquiry into trade obstacles and the employment of the poor; 
the state of the silver currency was also a subject on which John 
Locke, its secretary, lost no time in making representations to 
the government. Locke's retirement in 1700 removed any 
chance of the board of trade advocating more enlightened 
opinions on commercial subjects than those, generally held. It 
had only a small share in making the constitutions of the Amer- 
ican colonies, as only the Carolinas, Pennsylvania, Georgia and 
Nova Scotia were formed after the reign of Charles II.; and in 1760 
a secretary of state for the colonies was appointed, to whom 
the control drifted away. In 1780 Burke made his celebrated 
attack on the public offices, which resulted in the abolition of 
the board. In 1786, however, another permanent committee 
of the privy council was formed by order in council, and with one 
or two small exceptions the legal constitution of the board of 
trade is still regulated by that order. Under it all the principal 
officers of state, including the first lords of the treasury and 
admiralty, the secretaries of state, and certain members of the 
privy council, among whom was the archbishop of Canterbury, 
obtained seats at' the board ex officio; and ten unofficial members, 
including several eminent statesmen, were also placed on the 
committee. The duties of the revived board were made the 
same as they were in the beginning of the century, but the growth 
of commerce necessarily threw new administrative duties upon 
it. The board of trade thus became a mere name, the president 
being practically the secretary of state for trade, and the vice- 
president became, in 1867, a parliamentary secretary, with 
similar duties to those of a parliamentary under-secretary of 
state. At present, besides the president, who has usually a 
seat in the cabinet, 1 and whose salary is £5000 a year, 
there is a parliamentary secretary with a salary of £1200, 
a permanent secretary (salary £1500, rising to £1800), and 
four assistant secretaries (each with a salary of £1200) for 
the harbour, marine, commercial, labour and statistical, and 
railway departments. There are also other important officials 
in charge of different departments, as mentioned below. 

1. The Commercial, Labour and Statistical Department is the real 
remains of the original board of trade, as it combines the charge 
of the trade statistics with the general consultative duties with which 
King Charles II. 's board was originally entrusted. The statistical 
work includes compiling abstracts, memoranda, tables and charts 
relating to the trade and industrial conditions of the United King- 
dom, the colonies and foreign countries, the supervision of the trade 
accounts, the preparation of monthly and annual accounts of ship- 
ping and navigation, statistics as to labour, cotton, emigration and 
foreign and colonial customs, tariffs and regulations. The commer- 
cial intelligence department collects and^ disseminates accurate 
information on general commercial questions, and collects and 
exhibits samples of goods of foreign origin competing with similar 
British goods. It keeps a register of British firms who may desire 
to receive confidential information relative to their respective trades 
and supplies that information free of charge. The labour statistics 
published by the department are exhaustive, dealing with hours of 
labour, the state of the labour market, the condition of the working 
classes and the prices of commodities; annual reports are also 



1 Since 1882 there have been only two occasions on which the 
president of the board was not included in the cabinet. Frequent 
suggestions were made as to raising the status and salary 
of the president of the board, which up to 1900 was £2000. Lord 
Jersey's committee in 1904 suggested that the president should be 
put on the same footing as a secretary of* state, and be given the 
title of " minister of commerce and industry/' In 1909 the Board 
of Trade Act repealed the Board of Trade (President) Act 1826, 
which limited the salary of the president, and enacted that the 
president should be paid such annual salary as parliament might 
determine (£5000). The increased salary came into operation in 
1910, when a new president of the board came into office.

published of trade unions, of strikes and lock-outs and other important 
subjects. The staff comprises a controller-general (salary £1200 
rising to £1500), a deputy controller-general and labour commis- 
sioner, a principal for statistics, a principal of the commercial depart- 
ment, an assistant labour commissioner, a chief staff officer for 
commercial intelligence, a chief labour correspondent, a special 
inquiry officer, and a staff of investigators and labour correspondents. 
The department also edits the Board of Trade Journal (started in 
1886), giving items of commercial information, trade and tariff 
notices and various periodical returns. There are also branches 
which deal with the census of production, labour exchanges^ &c. 

2. The Railway Department was originally constituted in 1840, 
and performs multifarious duties under various railway acts, 
including the inspection of railways before they are open, inquiries 
into accidents, reports on proposed railways, approval of by-laws, 
appointment of arbitrators in disputes, as well as many duties under 
private railway acts. The inspection of tramways, their by-laws 
and " provisional orders" are all dealt with here, as are similar 
orders relating to gas and water schemes and to electric lighting. 
There is a special office of inspection of railways with a chief 
inspecting officer (salary £1400) and an assistant staff. Patents, 
designs and trade marks are now dealt with by the patent office 
under the charge of a controller-general (salary £1800), which is 
subordinate to the railway department, and copyright, art unions 
and industrial exhibitions are also among the matters deak with by 
the department. Annual returns with regard to its business are 
published by the department. 

3. The Marine Department was created a separate branch of the 
board of trade in 1850, about which time many new and important 
marine questions came under the board of trade, such, for example, 
as the survey of passenger steamers, the compulsory examination 
of masters and mates, the establishment of shipping offices for the 
engagement and discharge of seamen. Further work fell to the 
marine department by the act of 1853, which gave it the control of 
lighthouse funds, and to a certain extent of pilotage. The consoli- 
dating Merchant Shipping Act of 1854 and subsequent legislation 
so much increased the department that in 1866 it was divided into 
three, viz. the present marine department, which deals with ships 
and seamen, the harbour department and the finance department. 

4. The Harbour Department was, as stated above, a branch of 
the marine department until 1866, so far as it is connected with 
the physical adjuncts of navigation, but various other matters have 
since been added, e.g. the charge of the foreshores belonging to the 
crown, formerly managed by the commissioners of woods and forests, 
and the protection of navigable harbours and channels, long under 
the control of the admiralty, provisional orders under the General 
Pier and Harbour Acts and under the Pilotage Acts, and the settle- 
ment of by-laws made by harbour authorities. Control over the 
lighthouse funds of the lighthouse authorities of the United King- 
dom, the registry of British ships, wreck, salvage and quarantine are 
all among the matters dealt with by this department, which also has 
charge of the standards department for weights and measures. 

5. The Finance Department was, like the harbour department, 
separated in 1866 from the marine department. The accounts of 
all the branches of the board of trade are in its charge, including 
the subordinate offices. It also deals with the accounts of harbours, 
lighthouses and mercantile marine offices, and of the merchant 
seamen's fund, and with the consuls* accounts for disabled seamen 
abroad. Savings banks and seamen's money orders are also among 
the accounts and payments with which it is charged, and outside 
these marine matters it has to prepare for parliament the life in- 
surance companies' accounts and to take charge of the bankruptcy 
estate accounts. 

6. The Bankruptcy Department was established under the 71st 
section of the Bankruptcy Act 1883. At its head is the inspector- 
general in bankruptcy (salary £1200). An account of the duties 
of the department will be found under Bankruptcy. 

7. The Fisheries Department. — By an act of 1886 the powers of 
the home office over salmon and other fisheries were transferred 
to the board of trade, and a small department was consequently 
created charged with the care of those industries. But by an act 
of 1903 (3 Ed. VII. c. 31) the powers and duties of the board of 
trade under this department were transferred to the board of 
agriculture and fisheries. 

TRADE MARKS. A " trade mark " may be defined as a 
symbol, consisting in general of a picture, a label or a word or 
words, applied or attached to the goods of a trader for the purpose 
of distinguishing them from the similar goods of other traders, 
and of identifying them as his goods, or as those of his successors, 
in the business in which they are produced or put forward for 
sale. A trade mark differs in its legal character both from a 
patent and from a copyright. In the case of a trade mark the 
property and the right to protection are in the device or symbol 
adopted to designate the goods to be sold, and not in the article 
which is manufactured and sold. The article is open to the 
whole world to manufacture and sell, and all that the owner 



of the trade mark is entitled to prevent is such use of his* mark 
by other traders as will lead purchasers to buy, as his, goods 
which are not his. On the other hand, patent-right and copy- 
right protect the substance of the article; and any unauthorized 
manufacture of it in the former case, or reproduction of it in the 
latter, while the protection lasts, is prohibited. The grounds, 
however, on which trade marks, patent-right and copyright 
obtain legal recognition, though they are to a certain extent 
dissimilar, have a common element. Patent-right and copy- 
right rest upon the view that the results of the original labour of 
the inventor and the author ought, as a matter alike of justice 
and of public policy, to be secured against piracy; while, as 
regards the proprietor of a trade mark, the question of originality 
does not arise so long as the mark is sufficiently distinctive really 
to identify his goods and, for purposes of registration, to satisfy 
the Trade Marks Acts. In truth, the registration of a trade mark 
is rather the recognition of a fact than the grant of a privilege 
(Kerly and Underhay, Trade Marks Act, 1905, p. 3). The law as 
to trade marks as well as that as to patents or copyright is based 
on a man's rights to have guaranteed to him the profit derivable 
from his own property. " No man," said James (L.J.), in the 
case of the Singer Manufacturing Co. v. Loog (1880, 18 Ch. D., 
412), "is entitled to present his goods as being the goods of 
another man, and no man is permitted to use any mark, sign 
or symbol, device or means, whereby, without making a direct 
false representation himself to a purchaser from him, he enables 
such purchaser to tell a lie or to make a false representation to 
somebody else who is the ultimate customer." 

I. British Trade Marks before the Registration Acts. — The 
existing law in the United Kingdom cannot be properly appre- 
ciated unless the subject is approached in the first instance from 
the historical side. English trade-mark law practically com- 
mences with the first years of the 19th century. The use of 
trade marks was indeed of far earlier date, for in 1742 we find 
Lord Hardwicke declaring that " every particular trader had 
some particular mark or stamp." But in the very case in which 
Lord Hardwicke made that statement (Blanchard v. Hill, 
2 Atkyns, 484) he refused to protect the " Great Mogul " stamp 
on cards, being apparently under the influence of the notion 
that the legal recognition of trade marks would involve the 
creation of a new species of monopoly; and with regard to a 
case decided in the reign of James I. (Southern v. How 1 , Cro. 
Jac. 471), in which a clothier had applied the mark of another 
clothier to his own inferior goods, the reports leave it doubtful 
whether the action was brought by the owner of the mark, or 
by a defrauded customer, in which latter event it would be merely 
an ordinary action for deceit. But although the actual law of 
trade marks cannot be traced farther back than the beginning of 
the 19th century, Lord Eldon repeatedly granted injunctions 
to restrain one trader from fraudulently " passing off " his goods 
as those of another, and thus laid a foundation on which the 
present law has been built up. The stages through which its 
development passed possess considerable interest, and may be 
described quite briefly. The first reported case — apart from the 
doubtful one in the time of James I. above referred to — in which 
the infringement of a trade mark (a label on blacking) was 
restrained by the court of chancery was Day v. Day (Eden on 
Injunctions, ed. 1821, p. 314) in 1816. In 1824 the common law 
courts, in the case of Sykes v. Sykes (3 B. & C. 541), established 
the right of the owner of an infringed trade mark to damages. 
In 1833 it was held by the court of king's bench that it was not 
necessary for the plaintiff in an infringement action to prove 
that the defendant's goods were inferior to his, or that he had 
suffered special damage by the infringement. Later this became 
a rule of equity as well as of law. On another point, however, 
the practice of the courts of common law and equity diverged 
for a time. It was decided by Lord Cottenham in 1838, in the 
leading case of Millington v. Fox (3 Mylne & Craig 338), that an 
injunction to restrain the infringement of a trade mark could 
be obtained, even although the defendant had acted without 
fraudulent intent. On the common law side, on the other hand, 
fraud was an essential ingredient in the cause of action, and 



TRADE MARKS

remained so till the fusion of law and equity by the Judicature 
Acts. 

The effect of Lord (Tottenham's decision in the case of Milling- 
ton v. Fox clearly was to recognize a right of property in trade 
marks, and the action for infringement became a familiar species 
of litigation. Under the then existing law, however, the plain- 
tiff in such actions generally found himself in a very disadvan- 
tageous and unsatisfactory position. The basis of his action was 
the reputed association between his trade mark and his goods. 
This association the defendant — often a person of no means — 
would deny, and it had to be proved as a fact by witnesses at 
a cost to the plaintiff which there was little hope of his recovering. 
Moreover, even if the trade mark proprietor' secured a judgment 
in his favour, it carried with it no immunity from the obligation 
of again establishing his right to the mark against any subsequent 
infringer who chose to dispute it. Thus — to take an interesting 
and pertinent illustration given in Kerly on Trade Marks (p. 6) 
— the case of Rodgers v. Nowill (22 L. J. Ch. 404) lasted five years 
and cost the plaintiff £2211, without giving him in the end any 
security that he might not have to incur equal delay and expense 
in proving his title to the exclusive use of the trade mark in 
proceeding against other defendants. To complete this state- 
ment of the shortcomings of the law before the Merchandise 
Marks Act 1862, it should be noted that the infringement of 
trade marks — except in cases where the seller of spuriously 
marked goods cheated the buyer — was not a criminal offence. 
The remedies obviously needed were the establishment of a 
system of registration of trade marks which would simplify the 
proof of a plaintiff's title, and the creation of a criminal law of 
false marking. 1 The first step in the accomplishment of the 
latter object was taken by the Merchandise Marks Act 1862. 

II. Under the Registration Acts. — Provision was first made for 
the registration of trade marks by the Trade Marks Registration 
Act 1875. That statute made registration in the register of 
trade marks which it established prima facie evidence of the right 
of the registered proprietor to the exclusive use of the trade mark 
in connexion with goods of the class for which it was registered 
and used, and enacted that it should after the expiration of five 
years be conclusive proof of such right, provided that the 
proprietor of the mark remained the owner of the goodwill of 
the business in which it was used. This provision was carried 
as to the act of 1883 (s. 76). The act also provided that a person 
should not be entitled to institute any proceeding to prevent 
the infringement of trade mark until it was registered, or (a 
later statutory modification) until, in the case of a mark in use 
before the passing of the act of 1875, registration of the mark 
as a trade mark had been refused. The act of 1875 was a con- 
siderable success, but no provision was made under it for the 
registration of words unless they either were old marks or were 
registered in combination with one or more of the " essential 
particulars " prescribed by the act, such as a distinctive device, 
heading, mark, label or ticket. These limitations excluded from 
registration most of the trade marks ordinarily in use. 

The Patents Designs and Trade Marks Act 1883 remedied 
this defect besides altering the law in other important respects. 
The act of 1883 was amended in 1888 on the recommendation 
of a committee presided over by Lord Herschell. Neither the 
act of 1875 nor those of 1883 and 1888 altered the common law 
definition of a trade mark, nor contained any definition of the 
term. The description in the acts of what was registrable as a 
trade mark led to much litigation, and the interpretations of 
the judges left commercial men dissatisfied on three points : 
(1) the number of good and valuable trade marks which were 
not registrable; (2) that on .allowing registration the patent 
office insisted on disclaimers which hampered the owner in 
obtaining protection in the colonies and foreign countries; (3) 
that there was no effective period of limitation to attacks on 

1 Further reference may be made, in regard to the subject of 
trade marks before the Registration Acts 1883-1888, to an admirable 
introductory chapter in Kerly on Trade Marks, and also to the report 
of the Merchandise Marks Committee 1862, and the annual reports 
of the commissioners ar'd the comptroller-general of patents from 
1876 to 1884 (2nd report).

registered trade marks, because though registration for five 
years was declared conclusive by s. 76 of the act of 1883, the 
powers of the court to rectify the register could be invoked even 
after the lapse of the five years (re Gestetner's Trade Mark, 1907, 
2 Ch. 478). In re-enacting and enlarging the provisions of the 
act of 1875 the act of 1883 laid down certain essential particulars 
of one at least whereof a trade mark must consist to be regis- 
trable. These particulars will be considered later in dealing 
with the present law. The act of 1883 first provided for " word 
marks," and included among them " a fancy word or words not 
in common use " [s. 64, (1) (c)]. 

The expression "fancy word," used in the act of 1883, gave 
rise to considerable difference of opinion. It was interpreted 
by the court of appeal as equivalent to " obviously meaningless 
as applied to the article in question," or " obviously non- 
descriptive." In accordance with this interpretation, the words 
" gem " for guns, " melrose " for a hair restorer, " electric " 
for velveteen, and " washerine " for a soap were all held not 
to be registrable. On the recommendation, however, in 1887, 
of a committee appointed by the board of trade, and presided 
over by Lord Herschell, the expression " invented word " was 
substituted for " fancy word " by the act of 1888. 

In 1905 and 1907 the legislation as to trade marks was 
amended and remodelled. A bill was introduced in 1905 at 
the instance of the London Chamber of Commerce, and after 
consideration by a select committee became the Trade Marks 
Act 1905. This act repeals the bulk of the provisions of the 
Patents, &c, Acts of 1883 and 1888 with respect to trade marks, 
and embodies them with amendments (to be noticed later) in a 
separate statute. The only portions of the earlier acts left 
standing with respect to trade marks were ss. 83 and 84 (as 
amended in 1885 and 1888) with reference to the administration 
in the patent office of the law as to trade marks (1905, s. 74); 
ss. 103 and 104 of the act of 1883 (as amended in 1885) relating 
to registration of trade marks, both as enacted in the acts of 1883 
and 1885 and as applied by orders in council, are to be read as 
applying to trade marks registrable under the act of 1905 (s. 65). 
The sections of the Patents Acts of 1883, 1885 and 1888, thus 
preserved as to trade marks, were repealed by the Patents and 
Designs Act 1907. Sections 62 seq. of this act replace ss. 83 
and 84 of the act of 1883, and retain the administration of trade 
mark law in the patent office; and s. 91 replaces ss. 103 and 104 
of the act of 1883 as to international and colonial arrangements 
for mutual protection (inter alia) of trade marks. According 
to the rule laid down by the Interpretation Act 1889 the refer- 
ences in the act of 1905 to the acts of 1883, &c, are to be read 
as applying to the above-stated sections of the act of 1907. 

The act of 1905 differs from the preceding acts in containing a 
definition of trade mark for the purposes of the act unless the context 
otherwise requires; viz. that it " shall mean a mark used or proposed 
to be used upon or in connexion with goods for the purposeof indicat- 
ing that they are the goods of the proprietor of such mark by virtue 
of manufacture, selection, certification, dealing with or offering 
for sale "; and " mark " is defined as including " a device, brand, 
heading, label, name, signature, word, letter, numeral or any 
combination thereof" (s. 3). The act, modifying to the extent 
indicated in italics the acts of 1883 and 1888, prescribes (s. 9) that a 
trade mark to be registrable must contain or consist of at least one 
of the following essential particu lars :— 

1. The name of a company, individual or firm represented in a 
special or particular manner (under the act of 1883 it has been held 
that the name must be in the nominative case, and that ordinary 
printing is not representation in a particular manner). 

2. The signature of the applicant for registration or some prede- 
cessor in his business. It is not clear that this includes descriptive 
trading styles. 

3. An invented word or words. 

4. A word or words having no direct reference to the character 
or quality of the goods, and not being according to its ordinary signifi- 
cation a geographical name or a surname, 

5. Any other distinctive mark; but a name, * signature, or word or 
words other than such as fall within the descriptions in the above para- 
graphs 1, 2, 3 and 4, shall not, except by order of the board of trade or 
of the court, be deemed a distinctive mark. By distinctive is meant 
11 adapted to distinguish the goods of the proprietor of the trade 
mark from those of other persons": and " ^determining whether 
a trade mark is so adapted the tribunal may in the case of a trade 
mark in actual use take into consideration the extent to which such 

5 



13° 



TRADE MARKS 



user has rendered such trademark in fact distinctive for the goods 
in respect of which it is registered or proposed to be registered." 
Where the mark is limited to specified colours, that fact may be 
taken into account in deciding whether the mark is distinctive (s. 10). 
There are certain special rules as to cotton marks. 

Trade marks containing the essential particulars are not regis- 
trable if they contain any matter which would by reason of its being 
calculated to deceive or otherwise be disentitled to protection in a 
court of justice or would be contrary to law or morality, or any 
scandalous design (s. n). (See Eno v. Dunn, 1890, is^App. Cas. 
293, and the " Motricine " case, 1907, 2 Ch. 435.) Registration of 
the same matter as a trade mark under the act of J905 and as a 
design under the Patents and Designs Act (1007) is possible (re 
U.S. Playing Card Co.'sApplic, 1907, W. N. 251). 

Old marks are registrable, i.e. any special or distinctive word or 
words, letter, numeral or combination of letters or numerals, used 
by the applicant or his predecessors in business before the 14th of 
August 1875, subject to the qualification that it has " continued to 
be used either in its original form or with additions or alterations 
not substantially affecting the same down to the date of the applica- 
tion for registration " (s. 9). In the case of new marks, but not of 
old marks, a trade mark is not registrable except by order of the 
court in respect of any goods or description of goods which is 
identical with a mark already on the register with respect to such 
goods or description of goods, or so nearly resembles such registered 
mark as to be calculated to deceive (s. 19). 

Most controversy arose under the acts of 1883 and 1888 as to 
the meaning of the phrase " invented word " preserved in the act 
/ ted °^ I 9°5" ^ n invented word need not be wholly 
w^d meaningless, nor is it disqualified because words may 

or s * have suggested it. Thus " mazawattee " was held 
to be an " invented word," although the latter part of it was 
a Sinhalese term meaning " estate," and there were estates 
in Ceylon having names ending with " wattee " from which 
tea came; and in a leading case on the construction of the 
clauses under consideration (Eastman Co.'s Trade Mark, L. Rep. 
1898, A. C. 571), the word " solio "was held to be registrable as a 
trade mark for photographic printing paper under both clauses, 
although it was objected that ' solio" was equivalent to "sunio." 
The expression " calculated to deceive " has been considered by 
the courts in very many cases. It is not merely or chiefly the retailer 
or dealer who has to be kept in view when the question of the likeli- 
hood of deception is under consideration. The courts have regard 
also, and mainly, to the ultimate purchaser whom the trade mark 
may reach, and careless or unwary persons are considered as well as 
those who are careful and intelligent. The judge's eye is the ultimate 
test as to the degree of resemblance that is calculated to deceive, 
although expert evidence on the point is admissible. " Savonol " 
for soap (/. C. & J. Field Ltd. v. Wagel Syndicate Ltd., 1900, 17 
R.P.C. 266), " tachytype " for typographical and composing 
machines (in re Linotype Co.'s Application, iqoo, ij R.P.C. 380), 
have been held to be invented words. But the following have been 
held not invented — " uneeda " (=you need a) in re National 
Biscuit Co. (1902 ; 1 Ch. 783) ; " absorbine " for an absorbent prepara- 
tion (Christy & Co. v. Tipper 6f Son, 1905, 21 R.P.C. 97, 775); 
" bioscope " (Warwick Trading Co. v. Urban, 1904, 21 R.P.C. 240); 
" cyclostyle " (re Gestetner's Trade Mark, 1907, 2 Ch. 478) ; and cf. in 
re Kodak and Trade Marks (1903, 20 R.P.C. 337). 

Subsections (3) and (4), it should be noted, are independent: 
the former deals with newly-coined words, the latter deals with 
the existing words of the English language, or of other languages 
likely to be known to the public. A word which is really " invented " 
may be registered, whether it is descriptive or not. An old word 
used in a new sense is not invented (Hommel v. Bauer & Co., 1904, 
21 R.P.C. 576). The exact scope of clause (5) as to other distinctive 
marks has not been much discussed by the courts. Registration 
was allowed of the word " apollinaris " as a distinctive mark for the 
mineral waters of the applicants, on an undertaking to apply it only 
to water from the Neuenahr spring or^ district (in re Apollinaris 
Trade Mark, 1907, 2 Ch. 178X Under prior legislation the mark had 
been refused registration as being a geographical name (re Apollinaris 
Co.'s Trade Mark, 1891, 2 Ch. 186). 

Identical marks (except old marks) may not be registered in 
respect of the same goods, or goods of the same description, for 
two different persons (s. 19); and where several appli- 
cants make rival claims to identical marks the registrar 
may refuse to register until their rights have been deter- 
mined by the court or settled by agreement in manner approved 
by the registrar, or, on appeal, by the board of trade (s. 20). In the 
case of honest concurrent user or of other special circumstances 
making it proper so to do, the court may permit the registration of 
the same marie or of nearly identical marks for the same goods by 
more than one owner, subject to such conditions or limitations, if 
any, as to mode or place of use or otherwise as the court may think 
it right to impose (s. 21). 

New provisions were made in 1905 as to what are called " associa- 
ted trade marks." Where registration is sought for a mark so closely 
resembling a mark of the applicant already on the register for 
the same goods as to be calculated to deceive or cause confusion if 
used by any one but the applicant, the registration of the new mark 



Identical 
Marks* 



may be conditional on entering both marks as associated trade 
marks (s. 24). This section applies only to marks closely resembling 
one already on the register for the same goods or des- 
cription of goods, and has nothing to do with identical A? 80 £ iaied 
marks (Birmingham Small Arms Co.'s Application, 1907, Marks * 
2 Ch. 396). * 

In the case of combined trade marks provision is made for regis- 
tering as separate trade marks -the part in which the applicant has 
exclusive rights, and as associated marks trade marks of which the 
exclusive portion forms a part (s. 25). 

A series of trade marks of the same owner may be registered on 
one registration as associated marks (s. 26). 

Provision is made for allowing the registration of marks used 
upon or in connexion with goods by an association (or person) 
which undertakes the examination of goods in respect „, 
of origin, material, mode of manufacture, quality, standard- 
accuracy, or other characteristic, and certifies the result I^^Jf 
of the examination by marks used upon or in connexion MarKS * 
with the goods. These marks cannot be registered unless the board 
of trade consider their registration of public advantage. Their 
registration is not conditional on the association or person being a 
trader or having goodwill in connexion with the examination or 
certification. The registration gives the association or person the 
rights of the owner of a registered trade mark, except that assign- 
ment and transmission needs permission of the board of trade 
(8.6a). 

In respect of cotton piece-goods, marks consisting of a line heading 
alone or a word alone are not registrable, and no word or line heading 
is treated as distinctive in respect of such goods. In c 
respect of cotton yarn the same rule applies with respect m k 
to words, and no registration of any cotton mark gives marks* 
any exclusive right to the use of a word, letter, numeral, line, 
heading or combination thereof [s. 64 (10)]. 

By s. 68, which is a re-enactment of s. 105 of the Patents, &c, Act, 
1883, it is made illegal for any person without the authority of the 
king to use the royal arms in any trade in such a manner u f 
as to create the belief that he has authority so to do; 0°°* 
a similar provision is embodied in the Merchandise a°%?- a^ 
Marks Act 1898 of the Isle of Man. Arms ' tfc * 

The central register of trade marks is kept at the Patent Office, 
Southampton Buildings, London, and is under the charge of the 
comptroller-general of patents, designs and trade marks, Rer i stries 
who is appointed by and acts under the superintendence 
of the board of^ trade, and has a deputy — the registrar of trade 
marks. There is a branch registry at Manchester, whose chief 
officer is the keeper of cotton marks, which deals with all applications 
for the registration of trade marks for cotton goods falling within 
classes 23, 24, 25 in schedule 3 of the Trade Marks Rules 1906. The 
registry has been long established, but was not recognized by statute 
till 1905. Records are kept and are open to public inspection of 
all applications made since 1875, whether gran ted or refused. 

There is a branch registry at Sheffield containing the marks for 
metal goods (" Sheffield marks ") registered by persons carrying on 
business^ in or within six miles of Hallamshire. The care of this 
register is vested in the Cutlers' Company, who are substituted for 
the comptroller as to registration of Sheffield marks" (s. 63). 
Applications made to the company are notified to the registrar, and 
may not be proceeded with if he objects. Any person aggrieved by 
the registrar s objection may appeal to the court. Applications made 
to the registrar for metal marks are notified to the Cutlers' Company. 
Persons aggrieved by the decision of the Cutlers' Company have 
an appeal to the courts (s. 64). 

In 1906 fourteen applications were made at the head registry 
which were all dealt with by the Cutlers' Company. That company, 
by arrangement made with the sanction of tne^ treasury, retain all 
fees taken at Sheffield with respect to registration up to £400, and 
half of the fees received in excess of that amount (Pari. Pap. t 1907, 
No. 164, p. 9). 

A trade mark must be registered in respect of particular goods 
or classes of goods (s. 8), and the classification in force is scheduled 
to the Trade Marks Rules 1906 (R. & O., 1006, No. 233). _-^ 
Doubts as to the class to which the goods in question Hroce y ure * 
belong are settled by the registrar. The procedure for obtaining 
registration is regulated by the act of 1905 and the rules above 
mentioned. The registrar has power to refuse applications or 
accept them absolutely or subject to conditions, amendments and 
modifications (s. 12). His discretion is not absolute, but subject 
to the provisions of the act (re Birmingham Small Arms Co.'s 
Application, 1907, 2 Ch. 396)^ and he must if required state his 
reasons, and his decision is subject to appeal to the board of trade 
or the court at the option of the applicant [s. 12 (3)]. 

" New marks " may not be placed on the register except by order 
of the court for any goods or description of goods which are identical 
with marks already on the register with respect to the same goods, 
&c, or so nearly resemble a registered mark as to be calculated to 
deceive (s/19). The question whether particular goods are of the 
same description is not determined solely by reference to the statu- 
tory classification. " The true test," says Kerly (Trade Marks, 
p. 181), " would seem to be supplied by the question: Are the two 
sets of goods so commonly dealt in by the same trader that his 






TRADE MARKS 



131 



customers, knowing his mark in connexion with one set, and seeing 
it upon the others, would be likely to suppose that it was used upon 
them also to indicate that they were his goods? " Wine and spirits, 
beer, and even aperient drinks and baking powder, have been held 
to be " goods of the same description." When a trade mark contains 
(1) parts not separately registered as trade marks or (2) matter 
common to the trade or otherwise of a non-distinctive character, 
the registrar, or the board of trade or the court, in deciding whether 
the mark shall be entered or retained on the register, may impose as 
a condition that the owner shall disclaim all right to exclusive use 
of any part or parts of such trade mark or of all or any portion of 
such matter to the exclusive use whereof they deem him not to 
be entitled, or make any other disclaimer which they consider 
needful to define his rights under the registration (s. 15). Marks 
calculated to deceive are not entitled to protection (Eno v. Dunn, 
1890, 15 App. Cas. 250). b 

Applications as accepted are advertised; the advertisements 
state the conditions, if any, imposed on acceptance (s. 13). Notice 
of opposition to the registration of a trade mark may be given under 
s. 14 of the act of 1905 (which replaces s. 69 of the act of 1883). 
The registrar after consideration decides whether the opposition is 
well or ill founded. His decision is subject to appeal to the High 
Court or by consent of the parties to the board of trade [1Q05, s. 14 
(5)]. In 1906 there were 251 notices of opposition, of which 51 were 
heard. There were 4 appeals to the board of trade, all referred by 
the board to the court under s. 59 of the act. 

There may be added to any one or more of the " essential particu- 
lars " above enumerated any letters, words or figures, or a combina- 
tion of these. But the right to the exclusive use of the added matter 
must be disclaimed. A man is not required, however, to disclaim 
his own name, or trade name, or that of his place of business, if the 
name appears in the mark. The number of applications to register 
trade marks in 1884 was 7104, and the number of marks registered 
4523. In 1906 the corresponding figures were 11,414 and 4731. 
These figures included 153 applications made to the Cutlers' 
Company at Sheffield (Pari. Pap., 1907, 164, 24th report). 

The register may be corrected on the request of the registered 

owner of a trade mark as to errors or changes of address in the name 

of the registered owner, or by cancelling entries of 

rf4« mar ^ s or by striking out classes of goods for which 
ana Altera- a mar j c j s registered or by entering disclaimers or 
Register memoranda as to a mark, provided that they do not 

* . exten d t he rights given by the existing registration 
(s. 3^)» 

A registered trade mark may be altered or added to in matters 
not substantially affecting its identity (s. 34). Thus a firm on be- 
coming a limited company has been allowed to add the word 
" limited " to its name upon a registered mark, but no alteration 
will be permitted in regard to any "essential particular." In the 
above cases the corrections or alterations are made by the registrar 
subject to appeal to the board of trade (ss. 32, 34). A registered 
trade mark may be taken off by order of the court on the application 
of a person aggrieved, on the ground that it was registered without 
a bona fide intention to use it in connexion with a particular class of 
goods, and that there has not been any such bona fide user, or that 
there has been no such bona fide user during the five years preceding 
the application. Non-user may be excused if proved to be owing 
to special circumstances and not to any intention not to use or to 
abandon the use of the mark (s. 37). (See re Hare's Trade Mark, 
1907, 24 R.P.C. 263). 

The register may be rectified by order of the court on the 
application of any person aggrieved, or in the case offraud in regis- 
tration or transmission of the mark on the application of the 
registrar. The powers of rectification include < correcting or 
expunging wrong entries, supplying errors and omissions and defects 
( s * 35)* 

Registration is effective for 14 years but is renewable (s. 28). 
The registration if valid gives the proprietor the exclusive right to 
Eff dot e use °^ l ^ e mar "k on or m connexion with the 

p L goods in respect of which it is registered (1905, s. 39). 

tlon This ru ^ e * s subject t0 tne following qualifications. 

. (a) Where two or more persons are registered owners 
of the same or substantially the same mark in respect of the same 
goods, no one of them shall as against any other of them have any 
right of exclusive user except so far as their respective rights have 
been defined by the court, (b) Registration of a trade mark does 
not entitle the proprietor to interfere with or restrain the user by 
any person of a similar mark upon or in connexion with goods upon 
or in connexion with which such person has by himself or his 
predecessors in business continuously used such trade mark from a 
date anterior to the use of the mark by the registered proprietor, 
or to object to the registration of the other man's similar mark for 
concurrent user, 

# 1 h all legal proceedings relating to a registered trade mark registra- 
tion is prima facie evidence of validity, and after seven years from 
the original registration, or seven years from the passing of the act 
of 1905, whichever shall last happen, the original registration shall 
be taken to be valid in all respects unless it was obtained by 
fraud, or tjie mark offends against s. 11 of the act. This pro- 
vision as to validity limits the power which formerly existed of 



getting rid of long registered marks by proceedings to rectify the 
register. 

Registered trade marks are assignable and transmissible only with 
the goodwill of the business concerned in the goods for which they 
are registered, and are determinable with the goodwill (s. 22). 
Associated marks are assignable and transmissible only as a whole 
and not separately (s. 27). The owner of a registered mark may 
assign the right to use his registered mark in any British possession 
or protectorate or foreign country in connexion with any goods for 
which it is registered, together with the goodwill of the business 
therein of such goods (s. 22). Provision is made for apportioning 
marks where the goodwill of a business by dissolution of partnership 
or otherwise does not pass to a single successor (s. 23). 

The assignments, &c, on proof of title, are recorded on the register 
(s. 33) . It is a condition precedent to an action for the infringement 
of a new trade mark that the plaintiff should be the registered 
proprietor of the mark at the time when the action comes on for 
hearing. This last ^ provision docs not apply to. an action for 
" passing-off " (vide infra). In actions for infringement, evidence of 
passing off, or that the infringing mark is calculated to deceive, is 
not necessary. The court decides on the probability of deception 
by inspecting and comparing the marks (Hennessy v. Keating, 1907, 
24'R.P.C. 485). 

In the case of an old mark in use before the 14th of August 1875 

Eroceedings may be taken if registration under the act of 1907 has 
een refused (s. 42). 

^ The right to a trade mark lapses if the mark ceases to be distinc- 
tive and becomes publici juris ; if it is separated from the goodwill 
(a trade mark can only be assigned Avith the goodwill) ; if the mark is 
applied by the trader to spurious goods (as where boxes of cigarettes 
were so labelled, in conformity with an alleged custom of the trade, 
as to indicate that they were of^ Russian manufacture; which was 
not the fact; or when the mark is abandoned); (temporary disuse, 
hbwever, is not abandonment unless the mark has in the meantime 
become associated with the goods of another trader) ; or where, 
as in the " linoleum " case (7 Ch.^ D. 834) it has become the name of 
the goods, and so merely descriptive; or after fourteen years where 
registration is not renewed. In dealing with a claim for infringement 
the court must admitevidence of the usages of trade as to the get-up' 
of the goods for which the mark is registered, and of any trade 
marks or get-up legitimately used with such goods by other persons 

( s -43). . . . 

The registrar hasan uncontrolled discretion in the administration 
of the act, except in those cases in which an appeal is given from 
his acts or refusals to the court or the board of trade Aooea t s a- 
(ss. 53, 54). In cases of difficulty he consults the law pp ' 
officers (s. 56). 

Actions or other proceedings with relation to trade marks, so fai 
as they are for the court, may be brought in the High Court of 
Justice in England or Ireland and in the Court of Session in Scotland 
(ss. 3, 69). In the case of marks registered on application at the 
Manchester branch, the chancery court of Lancaster has concurrent 
jurisdiction with the High Court (s. 71). Actions for infringement 
of a trade mark are not within the jurisdiction of the county court 
(Bow v.Hart, 1905, 1 K.B. 592). An annual report is made by the 
comptroller-general of patents, &c, as to proceedings with reference 
to trade marks. 

III. " Passing-off " and Trade Name. — A trader has generally, 
besides his trade mark, numerous other symbols, which he uses 
as indicia of his goods, e.g. the name of title under which he 
himself trades, the name under which his goods are known and 
sold, badges of property which are termed "trade name," and 
the distinctive " get-up " of the goods as they appear in the 
market. These symbols enjoy the protection of the law, under 
certain conditions, equally with trade marks. No trader is 
entitled to " pass off " his goods as those of another, and if he 
infringes this rule he is liable to an action for an injunction and 
damages, and these rights are preserved by the Trade Marks Act 
1905 (s. 45). The right to be protected against " passing-off " is 
restricted to goods of the same description as those upon which 
the trader uses the " get-up," &c, imitated. Even if the " pass- 
ing-off " is done innocently it will be restrained (Millington 
v. Fox, 1838, 3 Mylne and Craig, 338). This case is described 
as not one of the use of a properly descriptive name, but rather 
a case of the same class as those in which a fancy or invented 
name is used (Cellular Clothing Co. v. Maxion, 1899, App. Cas. 
326, 341). Although the first purchaser is not deceived, still if 
the article delivered to him bears words or marks such that it is 
" calculated to deceive " a purchaser from him, the use of them 
is illegal. 

To this general rule there are several exceptions: — 
1. No monopoly is allowed in names that are merely descriptive. 
But words which prima facie are descriptive, such as " camel-hair 
belting," for belting made of camel-hair (Reddaway v. Bariham, 



132 



TRADE MARKS 



1896, App. Cas. 199), or " Stone Ales " for ales brewed at Stone 
(Montgomery v. Thompson, 1891, App. Cas. 217), may be t shown to 
have acquired by long use a " secondary distinctive meaning," and, 
in fact, to mean the goods of a particular trader. And where a 
defendant is not selling the genuine goods indicated by the name, 
as where the composition of the goods is a secret, even if the name 
might otherwise be taken as merely that of the goods, he cannot rely 
on the defence that the name is descriptive (Birmingham Vinegar 
Co. v. Powell^ 1897, App. Cas. 710; the " Yorkshire Relish Case '). 
If, however, the primary meaning of the word is simple and well 
known, it is extremely difficult to establish a secondary meaning 
exclusive of the primary one (Hommel v. Bauer & Co. f 1905, 22 R.P.C. 
43; " Haematogen," a preparation for forming blood, secondary 
meaning not established; cf. Fells v. Hedley & Co., 1904, 21 R.P.C. 
91; " Naphtha soap," secondary meaning not established; Wurm v. 
Webster & Girling, 1904, 21 R.P.C. 373; "White Viennese Band," 
secondary meaning not established ; Cellular Clothing Co. v. Maxton, 
1899, A.C. 326, " cellular " as applied to cloth, secondary meaning 
not established). But although a name may not, owing to the 
fact that it consists of well-known or descriptive words, be 
inherently entitled to protection, a distinctive scroll or device, in 
which it is embodied, may be so. Thus, in a case (Weingarten 
Brothers v. Bayer & Co., 1905, 21 Times L.R. 418; and see 19 Times 
L.R. 604) which sharply divided judicial opinion in England, the 
defendants were restrained from selling corsets in boxes bearing the 
name " Erect Form Corsets " scrolled thereon by the plaintiffs in 
a distinctive manner. No monopoly, of course, could be claimed in 
the words, but it was otherwise with the scroll. The use of a fancy 
name " iron oxide tablets " has been restrained where it was found 
likely to cause deception as being used to supersede in the market 
certain well-known " Iron Ox tablets (Iron Ox Remedy Co. 
v. Co-operative Wholesale Society Ltd., 1907, 24 R.P.C. 425). 
(2) A trader cannot be prevented from trading underjiis own name, 
if he is using it honestly (bona fide) ; even though from its similarity to 
the name of another trader — even one previously well-established — 
it may injure the business of the latter (Burgess v. Burgess, 1853, 
3 De Gex, M. & G. 896; Turtonv. Turton, 1889, 42 Ch. D. 128; 
Dunlop Pneumatic Tyre Co. v. Dunlop Motor Co., 1907, App. Cas. 
430). This right is recognized by the Trade Marks Act 1905, s. 44, 
which provides that registration of a trade mark under the act shall 
not interfere with any bona fide use by any person of his own name 
or place of business or that of any of his predecessors in business. 
But if a trader has never carried on such a business on his own 
account or in partnership with others, he cannot, by promoting 
and registering a joint-stock company with a title of which his name 
forms part, confer on the company the rights which he as an individual 
possesses in the use of his name (Fine Cotton Spinners> &c, Associa- 
tion Ltd. and John Cash & Sons Ltd. v. Harwood Cash & Co. Ltd., 
1907, 2 Ch. 184). If a trader's own name has, before he entered 
the trade, become the trade name of some other person's goods, 
he would probably not be allowed to use it without taking steps 
to prevent deception. This rule does not debar him from using 
" any bona fide description of the character or quality of his goods " 
(1905, s. 44). A name can become universally known as referring 
to the goods of a particular maker, i.e. as having a secondary meaning. 
This does not give exclusive rights to use of the name, but only 
to prevent other firms from using the goods so as to pass off their 
goods as those of the person whose name is in question (Joseph 
Rodgers & Sons Ltd. v. Hearnshaw, 1906, 23 R.P.C. 348). 

It is provided by the Companies Act 1862 (s. 20), that no company 
shall be registered under a name identical with that by which a 
subsisting company is already registered, or so nearly resembling 
it as to be calculated to deceive, unless the subsisting company is 
in process of being wound up and consents to such registration; 
ana provision is also made for a change of the name of any company 
which, through inadvertence or otherwise, is registered under a 
name coming within the statutory prohibition. It is to be observed 
(cf. Buckley, Companies Acts, 8th ed. p.27) that (a) the Companies 
Act 1862 applies only to the case of taking the name of a subsisting 
company already registered, and not toa case where a new company 
proposes to register in the name of, or in a name closely resembling, 
the name of an old-established company which is not registered, or 
of a firm or individual trader; (b) that as soon as the new company 
is registered the act ceases to apply; and (c) that the act forbids 
registration irrespectively of the question whether the business 
proposed to be carried on by the new company is the same as that 
of the subsisting company or not. But the provisions of the Com- 
panies Act on this subject are merely supplemental to the common 
law, and any company trading in the United Kingdom may restrain 
persons from registering a new company to carry on a rival business 
under a name identical with or so similar as to be calculated to 
deceive, and a company already registered under such a name may 
be restrained from carrying on a rival business under it. The right 
to interfere depends not upon fraud but upon the tendency of the 
similarity to cause confusion, deception or mistake (Fine Cotton 
Spinners case above cited; Birmingham Small Arms Co. v. Webb, 
1907, 24 R.P.C. 27; Star Cycle Co. v. Frankenburgs, 1907, 24 
R.P.C. 405^ re Reddaway % & Co., t 1907, 24 R.P.C. 203)^ In 
such proceedings evidence is admissible to show how the existing 



company has used the name, and what, by reason of its con- 
necting that name with its goods, the public have come to at- 
tribute to it (Daimler Motor Car Co. v. London Daimler Co., 1907, 
24 R.P.C. 379). A new company will not be allowed to take the 
whole name of a subsisting company, even although that name 
is of a descriptive character (Manchester Brewery Co. Ltd. v. North 
Cheshire and Manchester Brewery Co. L/d.,1899, App. Cas. 83). 

The purchaser of the goodwill of a business has the right to use 
the trade name under which the business is known, and to restrain 
others from using it or such imitations of it as may dj-uj s * 
mislead the public. But he is not entitled < by the use /^shnees. 
of the trade name to make the vendor liable, under t s 
the doctrine of " holding out," for debts of the business incurred 
after the sale. And if the vendor of the goodwill gaye his name 
to the business, he cannot (in the absence of any restrictive condition 
in the agreement for sale) be prevented from beginning to trade 
in his own name again, unless it be shown that in so doing he is 
attempting to deceive the public into the belief that he is still the 
owner of the old business. In construing the words " calculated 
to deceive " (s. 20) the courts will adopt principles closely analogous 
to those applicable in " passing off ' cases in which the question 
is raised whether a trade nape or the description or get-up of a 
particular class of goods is or is not likely to deceive (Britishvacuum 
Cleaner Co. v. New Vacuum Cleaner Co., 1907, 2 Ch. 312; Aerators 
Ltd. v. Totlett, 1902, 2 Ch. 319, 324). When the names of the two 
companies contain terms of common ordinary meaning descriptive 
of an article, s. 20 will be applied less readily than where the words 
said to create the confusion ai£ of the character of fancy words 
relating rather to the maker than the article (Vacuum Cleaner 
Case). 

IV. Merchandise Marks. — The first attempt to make tbe 
falsification of trade marks a criminal offence was in the Mer- 
chandise Marks Act 1862 (25 & 26 Vict. c. 88). That statute 
provided that the forgery of a trade mark with intent to defraud, 
and the false application of a trade mark to goods with the like 
intent, should be misdemeanours, but left upon the prosecutor 
the burden of establishing the fraudulent intent. The act * 
contained no provision for summary prosecutions, and did not 
provide for the seizure of falsely-marked goods on importation 
from abroad. The international convention for the protection 
of industrial property, made at Paris in 1883, to which Great 
Britain acceded in 1884, contains a provision that all goods 
illegally bearing a trade mark or trade name may be seized on 
importation into those states of the union where the mark or 
name has a right to legal protection, and that the seizure shall 
be effected at the request of either the proper public department 
or of the interested party, pursuant to the internal legislation 
of each country. The law had to be amended in order to carry 
out this article in the convention, and the Merchandise Marks Act 
1887 was passed to effectuate this object and generally to make 
better provision for the protection of merchandise. It was 
subsequently amended in 1891 and 1894. The effect of the 
provisions of these statutes may be briefly stated. Any person 
is guilty of an offence, punishable on indictment or summary 
conviction by fine or imprisonment, who does any of the five 
following acts, unless he proves as regards the first four of them 
that he acted without intent to defraud (there is a special 
defence to No. v. which is noted below): (i). forges any trade 
mark, or makes, disposes of, or has in his possession for such 
purpose any die or instrument; (ii.) falsely applies any trade 
mark or a colourable imitation of any trade mark to goods; 
(iii.) applies any false trade description to goods; (iv.) causes 
any of the above offences to be committed; (v.) sells or exposes 
for sale, or has in his possession for sale, trade or manu- 
facture, any goods or things to which any forged trade mark 
or false trade description is applied, or any trade mark 
or colourable imitation of a trade mark is falsely applied, 
unless the dejendant proves that, having taken all reasonable 
precautions, he had no ground to suspect tbe genuineness of 
the mark, &c, and also that on demand he gave to the prosecutor 
all the information in his power as to the person from whom he 
obtained the goods, &c, or proves that he otherwise acted 
"innocently." (See Tkwaites &• Co. v. McEvilly, 1903, 
20 R.P.C. 663). 

" Trade description " is defined as any descriptive statement or 
other indication as to the measurement, quantity (not quality, it 
should be observed), or weight, place or mode of production, or 



TRADE MARKS 



J 33 



the material of tta goods, or as to their being subject to an 
existing patent, privilege or copyright ; conventional or customary 
descriptions lawfully in use in August 1887 to indicate 
n w /; t ^ iat tne £°°d s are °f a particular class or method of 
Dwcrfp " orl ' manufacture are allowed to be continued; but if they 
contain the name of a place and are calculated to mislead as to 
the real place of production, the name of the latter must be 
added. The test 01 what is a trade description depends upon the 
understanding of the trade and not on scientific correctness 
(Fowler v. Cripps, 1906, 1 K.B. 16). 

On a prosecution for any of these offences, there is a power to forfeit 
the things found although no one is convicted. If the offender is 
indicted (it is in his option to be tried in this way) the punishment 
is fine and imprisonment, the latter not to exceed two years. On 
summary conviction the punishment is not to < exceed, for a first 
offence, four months' imprisonment, with or without hard labour, 
and a fine of £20; and for any subsequent offence six months' im- 
prisonment and a fine of £50. The < importation is forbidden of 
goods by meansof or in relation to which an offence against the acts 
has been committed, and also of all goods of foreign manufacture 
bearing any name or trade name being or purporting to be that 
of a manufacturer or trader within the country, unless it be accom- 
panied by a definite indication of the country where the goods were 
made or produced. There are also special provisions with regard 
to the marking of catch-cases. The commissioners of customs 
have power to make general orders for carrying out the Merchandise 
Marks Acts.^ (See Regulations of the 1st of December 1887, Stat. 
R. & O. Revised, 1904, vol. viii. tit. Merchandise Marks.) Prosecu- 
tions may be undertaken by the board of trade in cases appearing 
to affect the general interests of the countryor of a section of the 
community, or of a trade, subject to regulations made on the 21st 
of May^ 1892; and the board of agriculture and fisheries has a like 
power in the case of the produce of agriculture, horticulture and 
fisheries [act of 1894, s. 1; Board of Agriculture and Fisheries Act 
1903, s. 1 (8); see the regulations of the 27th of October 1894, 
Stat. R. & O. Revised, vol. viii. tit. Merchandise Marks.]. Under 
the Sale of Food and Drugs Act 1899, and the Butter and Margarine 
Act 1907, the importation, except in containers showing their 
character, of margarine, margarine cheese, adulterated or im- 
poverished butter, milk-blended butter or condensed, separated or 
skimmed milk, is penalized, and it is provided that the commissioners 
of customs, in accordance with directions given by the treasury after 
consultation with the board of agriculture, shall take such samples 
of consignments of imported articles of food as may be necessary 
for the enforcement of the law. 

V, International Arrangements. — (The Trade Marks Act 1905 
applies to the British Islands.) By the international conven- 
tion for the protection of industrial property (see Patents), 
which was signed at Paris in 1883, the signatory states (others 
have since acceded) agreed that the subjects or citizens of each 
state should, in all the other states, enjoy as regards trade marks 
and trade names the advantages that their respective laws then 
granted, or should thereafter grant, to their own subjects or 
citizens. So far as Great Britain is concerned the provisions 
made for carrying out this convention are contained in s. 65 of 
the Trade Marks Act 1905 and in s. 91 of the Patents and 
Designs Act 1907. 1 The effect of that section is to confer on 
an applicant for the protection of a trade mark in one of the 
other contracting states a priority over other applicants for 
registration in the United Kingdom during the space of four 
months. The section does not, however, exempt the applicant 
from the conditions and formalities incumbent on ordinary 
applicants for registration in Great Britain; nor does the fact 
that the foreign application has been successful of itself give 
the applicant a right to have his mark accepted for registration. 
Under the Convention of Madrid of the 14th of April 1891 
(to which Great Britain is not a party) a trade mark may be 
registered as the result of a single application in the countries 
of all the signatory powers. Besides the general international 
conventions there are also particular arrangements between 
many states, e.g. Germany and Italy (Italian law of the 24th 
of December 1903). Guatemala and Salvador, also signatory 
parties, have withdrawn from the convention.

All these orders in council are printed in the Statutory Rules 
and Orders Revised (ed. 1904), vol. ix., under the title " Patents, &c." 
By orders in council, made under the provisions of the Foreign 
Jurisdiction Acts, penalties have been imposed on British subjects 
committing offences against the Patents, &c, Act 1883-1888 (now 
represented by -the Trade Marks Act 1905, and the Patents and 
Designs Act 1907) and the orders in council issued thereunder, and 
the Merchandise Marks Act 1887: China and Corea (1904), Egypt 
(1899), Morocco (1889), Muscat (1904), Ottoman Empire (1899), 
Persia, Persian coast and islands (1889-1901), Siam (1906) and 
Zanzibar (1906). 

By s. 91 of the Patents and Designs Act 1907, 8 and s. 65 of the 
Trade Marks Act 1905, the king is empowered by order in council 
to applythe provisions of s.9iabove mentioned, with such variations 
or additions as may seemfit, to any British possession. The follow- 
ing is a list of the orders in council that have been issued : —

The orders in council up to 1903 are printed in the Statutory Rules 
and Orders Revised (ed. 1904), vol. ix.,underthe title" Patents, &c." 
It should be added that the protection of the Merchandise Marks 
Act 1887, extends to any trade mark which, either with or without 
registration, is protected by law in any British possession or foreign 
state to which the provisions of s. 103 of the act of 1883 or s. 91 of 
the act of 1907 are, under order in council, for the time being applic- 
able. 

A foreigner suing in the United Kingdom for infringement of a 
trade mark, or for " passing off," is in the same position as a subject. 

VI. Colonial and Foreign Trade Mark Laws. — The British 
colonies generally follow the model of the English Trade Marks 
Acts (1883-1888). 

Australia. — Legislation on trade marks is one of the subjects 
which the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900 
(s. 9, pt. v. 51, xviii.) places within the exclusive competence 
of the Federal Parliament. By the Commonwealth Trade 
Marks Act 1905, s. 20, provision is made for registration of 
trade marks throughout the Commonwealth, and subject to 
this act and other Commonwealth legislation the common law 
of England as to trade marks is applied throughout the Common- 
wealth. Prior to this act most of the states had their own trade 
mark law (New South Wales, No. 19 of 1900; Tasmania, No. 9 
of 1893; Victoria, No. 1146, 1890; Western Australia, Nos. 7 

2 A treaty was also concluded between Great Britain and the 
United States on the 24th of October 1877, for the protection of 
trade marks.

&c, Act 1883, 



134 



TRADE MARKS 



of 1884, 5 of 1886, 4 of 1894). But the state Trade Marks Acts, 

with certain savings, cease to apply to trade marks (1905, s. 6). 

The Commonwealth act contains certain novel provisions: — 

1. As to a Commonwealth trade mark to be applied to all goods 
included in or specified by a resolution passed by both houses, that 
in their opinion the conditions as to the remuneration of labour 
in connexion with their manufacture are fair and reasonable (s. 78). 
The mark consists in a device or label bearing the words " Australian 
Labour Conditions." 

2. As to workers' trade marks intended to protect the products 
of any individual Australian worker or association of such workers 
other than primary products of agricultural or pastoral industries 
(s. 74). Sections 115, 116 of the act contain provisions for inter- 
national and intercolonial arrangements as to protection of trade 
marks based on ss. 103, 104 of the act of 1883. By the Commerce 
Trade Descriptions Act, No. 16 of 1905, the import into and export 
from Australia of falsely marked goods is prohibited. 

In Canada the law as to trade marks (Rev. Stats, c. 63) and 
merchandise marks (c. 41 of 1888) has been regulated by 
Dominion acts, similar to English statute law. New Zealand has 
an act of 1889. The Hong-Kong ordinance, No. 18 of 1898, is a 
typical instance of an ordinance in a Crown colony [see also 
Ceylon, No. 9 of 1906, Jamaica (laws 17 of 1888 and 6 of 1889)]. 
In the Bahamas a trade marks law was passed on the 29th of 
May 1906, hased on the imperial act of 1905. In the Straits 
Settlements there is no registration of trade marks, but the 
common law as to " passing off " is applied. 

United States. — Provision for the registration of trade marks 
in the United States was first made by an act of Congress of 
1870; hut that enactment was subsequently declared invalid 
by the Supreme Court (U.S. v. Stejfens, 1879, I0 ° U.S. 82), on 
the ground that the constitution of the United States did not 
authorize legislation by Congress on the subject of trade marks, 
except such as had been actually used in commerce with foreign 
nations or with the Indian tribes. Congress legislated again 
on the subject in 1881 (act of the 3rd of March 1881, Revised 
Stats. U.S. ss. 4937-4947). The act of 1881 was repealed by- 
an act of the 20th of February 1905 (s. 592), which, as modified 
by an act of the 4th of May 1906, now regulates the subject. 
A trade mark may be registered by the owner if he is domiciled 
within the United States, including all territory under the juris- 
diction and control of the United States (s. 29), or resides or is 
located in any foreign country which hy treaty, convention or 
law affords similar privileges to citizens of the United States 
(s. 1). 

The right of persons domiciled in the United States was in 
1906 extended to owners of trade marks who have a factory 
in the United States, so far as concerns the registration, &c, of 
trade marks used in the products of the factory (1906, s. 3). To 
obtain registration the owner of the mark (whether firm, corpora- 
tion, association or natural person) must file in the patent office 
an application (a) specifying the name, domicile, location and 
citizenship of the applicant; (b) stating the class of merchandise 
and the particular description of goods in the class to which the 
mark is appropriated; ! (c) annexing a drawing of the trade mark 
and as many specimens as may be required by the commissioner 
of patents; (d) giving a description of the trade mark (only when 
needed to express colours not shown in the drawing); and (e) 
specifying the mode in which the mark is applied and affixed to 
goods; (/) stating the time during which the m rk has been used 
(1906, c. 2081, s. 1). 

The application must be accompanied by a fee of $10, and he 
supported by a sworn declaration verifying the ownership and 
the drawing and description and stating that no one else has a 
right to use the mark, nor one so like it as might be calculated 
to deceive, and that the mark is in use in commerce among the 
several states or with foreign countries or with Indian tribes 
(1005 c. 592, s. 2). 

Where the applicant resides or is located in a foreign country 
he must also show that the mark is registered in the foreign country, 
or that application has been made to register it there. Registration 
on behalf of foreign registrants is not made until foreign registration 
is proved nor unless application for United States registration is 

*By the law of 1906 (s. 21) the commissioner of patents is 
directed to establish classes of merchandise. 



made within four months of the application abroad (1905, c. 592, 
ss. 2, 4). 

The United States policy is to require registration of all trade 
marks unless they (a) consist of or comprise scandalous or immoral 
matter; (&) consist of or comprise the flag or insignia of the United 
States, or of any state or municipality, or of any foreign nation; (c) 
are identical with another known or registered trade mark owned 
and used by another and appropriated to merchandise of the same 
description, or so nearly resemble such other marks as to be likely 
to cause confusion or mistake in the mind of the public or to deceive 
purchasers; (d) consist merely in the name of an individual, firm, 
corporation or association, unless it is written, printed, impressed 
or woven in a particular or distinctive manner, or is associated 
with a portrait of the individual ; (e) consist merely in words or devices 
descriptive of the goods with which they are used, or of the character 
or quality of such goods, or merely of a geographical name or term ; 
(/) contain the portrait of a living individual unless his consent is 
evidenced by an instrument in writing. 

Old marks may be registered irrespective of the above rules, no 
proof that they have been actually and exclusively used as a trade 
park of the applicant or his predecessors from whom he derived title 
in such commerce as aforesaid for ten years before the 20th of April 
1905. Applications made in proper form with the prescribed fee 
are at once examined in the patent office and if in order are gazetted 
to give opportunity for " interference." 

Decisions of the examiners on applications or oppositions are 
subject to appeal to the commissioner of patents, and from him 
to the court of appeals for the District of Columbia (ss. 8, 9). The 
general jurisdiction in trade mark cases is given to the Federal courts 
below the Supreme Court, which has power by certiorari to review 
the. decisions of circuit courts of appeal upon such cases (ss. 17, 18). 
The maximum protection given by registration is twenty years. 
The protection given to marks already registered in a foreign 
country lapses when the mark ceasesto be protected in the foreign 
country (s. 12). Certificates of registration are issued under the 
seal of the patent office. 

Provision is made to prevent importation of merchandise which 
copies or simulates the name of any domestic manufacture, manu- 
facturer or trader, or of a manufacturer or trader located in a country 
affording like privileges to the United States, or which copies or 
simulates the trade mark registered in the United States, or which 
bears names or marks calculated to create the belief that it is made 
in the United States, or in any country other than the true country 
of origin. United States traders who seek protection can have their 
names and marks recorded and communicated to the customs 
department (s. 27). At any time during the six months prior to 
the expiry of the term of twenty years the registration may be 
renewed on the same terms and for a like period. The right to 
the use of any registered trade mark is assignable (with the goodwill 
of the business in which it is used) by an instrument in writing; 
and provision is made for recording such instruments in the patent 
office (s. 10). 

France. — In France (laws of the 23rd of June 1857, and the 3rd 
of March 1890) trade marks are optional, but may be declared 
compulsory for certain specified articles by decrees in the form of 
administrative orders. The decrees regulating registration are 
of the 27th of February 1891 and the 17th of December 1892. The 
following are considered trade marks: names of a distinctive 
character, appellations, emblems, imprints, stamps, seals, vignettes, 
reliefs, letters, numbers, wrappers and every other sign serving 
to distinguish the products of a manufacture or the articlesof a 
trade. A fixed fee of one franc is charged for entering the minute 
by registration (dep6t) of each mark, and making a copy thereof, 
exclusive of stamp and registration fees. By legislation of the 1st 
of August 1905 and the nth of July 1906 provision is made for 
marking certain classes of commodities, mainly food products, to 
prevent falsification and the sale of foreign products as French. 

Germany. — Under the German trade mark law of the 12th of May 
1894 any person whatsoever can acquire protection for a trade mark, 
and all foreigners in Germany are placed on an exactly equal footing 
with Germans in the eyes of the law, so long as they have a domicile 
(Niederlassung) within the empire, i.e. a place of business or a resi- 
dence which involves the payment of German taxes. The registration 
of a trade mark expires ipso facto after ten years from its date, 
but may be renewed for a similar period. Germany acceded to 
the international convention on the 1st of May 1903. 

In the Netherlands (law of the 30th of September 1893) two 
distinct forms of registration are in force: (a) registration merely 
for the Netherlands; (b) international registration, available for 
the states of the international union. 

The following other foreign trade mark lawsmay also be noted: 
Austria-Hungary, law of 1890 (published in Vienna on the 6th of 
January and in Budapest on the 6th of April 1 890) , and amending law 
of the 30th of July 1895, which enactment protects additions to trade 
marks. Denmark (law of the nth of April 1800, and an amending 
law of the 19th of. December 1898, which enables traders to register 
words or figures, provided that these are not indicative of the origin, 
kind, use, quality or price of the goods). Japan (law of the 1st 
of July, and regulations of the 20th of July 1899). Russia (law

(A.W.R.; W.F.C.) 
' TRADE ORGANIZATION. The development of commercial 
organization which attended the growth of trade and industry 
during the 19th century assumed two distinct phases. In the 
first we see the creation of associations of persons engaged in 
trade and industry for the purpose of protecting their interests 
and of facilitating and fostering commercial relations. In the 
second, governments elaborate departmental organizations for 
the supervision of commerial matters, and utilize their con- 
sular services as means of commercial intelligence and influence. 

The associations belonging to the first category comprise three 
classes: — 

a. Those which are themselves engaged in trade, like ordinary 
joint-stock companies, or which result from the combination of 
firms or individuals in the same or connected trades, for the 
purpose of facilitating or restricting production, limiting com- 
petition, regulating prices, &c. 

b. Those which, without engaging in trade, aim at providing 
facilities for the transaction of commercial or financial operations. 
They chiefly take the form of exchanges, bourses, public sale 
rooms, &c, such as the Baltic, Lloyd's, the Stock Exchange, 
the Corn and Coal Exchanges, the Commercial Sale Rooms. 

c. Non-trading bodies, in the nature of public institutions, 
whose objects are to protect the interests of trade. 

When, at the close of the 18th century and early in the 19th, 
the power of the old trade gilds and corporations of merchants 
had been broken, both governments and commercial men soon 
realized that the ancient societies would not follow the com- 
mercial evolution, and that new organizations must be created 
to meet new requirements. Two systems were evolved, which, 
British and hom their prototypes, are known as the British 
French and the French systems. In the former, trade 
Systems, organizations were left to develop themselves in 
their own way, and in whatever direction they might think 
fit, without any official interference. In the latter, on the 
contrary, the government constituted itself the creator of trade 
organizations, which it incorporated into the administrative 
system of the country, and to which it gave an official status as 
an integral part of the machinery of the state. The former 
have grown chiefly into associations for the promotion and 
defence of commercial interests, whilst the latter have mainly 
become sources of commercial information and means of action 
at the disposal of the government. While organizations on the 
British system are, as regards the government, purely advisory 
bodies whose opinion might or might not be asked in connexion 
with commercial matters, and whose duties are limited to the 
services which they are in a position to render to their members 
and to commerce generally, organizations on the French system 
not only must be consulted, in certain specified cases, by the 
government, especially in connexion with the drafting of com- 
mercial legislation and of regulations affecting trade, but they 
have also administrative duties to perform, such as the control 
of public commercial institutions, of testing, standardizing and 



conditioning establishments, port and dock works, &c. The 
British system obtains in the United Kingdom and the British 
colonies, in the United States and in Belgium, while the French 
has been adopted in most European countries, and in Japan. 

I. — Great Britain and Colonies 
A. — Commercial Associations* 
In the United Kingdom commercial associations arose with 
the growth of trade, without any assistance from the state and 
free from all government restriction or control. The first in 
point of date were the " commercial societies " which were 
formed, chiefly during the last quarter of the 18th century, in 
Birmingham, Exeter, Halifax, Leeds, Liverpool and Manchester, 
and which exercised a not unimportant influence upon com- 
mercial developments at the close of the 18th and in the early 
years of the 19th centuries. The modern associations which 
superseded them divided themselves into four classes, viz: — 

a. Chambers of commerce and associations which aim at 
becoming representative of general commercial interests; 

b. Associations or institutes which represent particular trades 
or branches of trades; 

c. Trade protection societies, which look after the interests 
of retail as well as wholesale traders, and undertake to supply 
them with information as to the standing and credit of firms, 
expose swindlers, collect debts, &c; and 

d. Non-representative associations rendering general com- 
mercial services. 

a. Chambers of Commerce and General Associations. — Most of 
the chambers of commerce in the United Kingdom were formed 
during the latter half of the 19th century, although a few were 
in existence much earlier. The oldest British chamber is the 
Jersey chamber, which dates from 1768. The Glasgow chamber 
was founded in 1783. Dublin followed in 1785, Edinburgh in 
1786, Manchester in 1794, Belfast in 1796, Birmingham in 1813, 
Newcastle-upon-Tyne in 1818, Liverpool in 1851, Sheffield in 1857, 
&c. The London chamber was the last of the chambers of impor- 
tance to be established; it dates only from 1881. 

The London Chamber of Commerce, which has over 3000 members, 
is one of the most representative associations of its kind, and the 
organization adopted has been very effective in securing rh r 
this. The chamber has been divided into trade sections, J£ ZLV'j! 01 ' 
of which there are at present forty-four, and members e * 

specify the sections to which they^ desire to belong. Each section 
has a separate organization, and is presided over by a chairman 
elected by itself, who may be helped by an elected committee if 
found advisable. The general council of the chamber confirms 
the election of chairmen of sections, and no action can be taken by 
the chamber on the recommendation of a section without authoriza- 
tion of the council. The chamber has placed itself in connexion 
with a number of mercantile associations which, whilst preserving 
their separate organizations and their independence of action, have 
found it advantageous to work in conjunction with it, either for 
general or for particular purposes, and to have a voice in its council. 
The more important of these are the Institute of Bankers, the 
Institute of Chartered Accountants, the Society of Accountants 
and Auditors, the General Ship Owners' Society, the General Produce 
Brokers' Association, the Federation of Grocers' Associations of 
the United Kingdom, the West India Committee, the Corn Trade 
Association, the United Planters' Association of Southern India, &c. 

Particular reference should also be made to the Liverpool chamber, 
which, as regards division into trade sections and co-operation 
with independent associations, works on similar lines «. 
to those of the London chamber. The African trade r'yeroool 
section of the Liverpool chamber has been prominent chamber 
in connexion with African questions, and since its 
foundation in 1884 has been the leading voice in all matters relating 
to West Africa. . 

The Association of Chambers of Commerce of the United Kingdom, 
which was formed in i860, contributed much to give chambers of 
commerce as a whole a national importance. This 
association, like the chambers themselves, was of course Association 



of Chambers 
of Com' 



purely voluntary, and at its foundation only sixteen 
chambers decided to join it. The association is main- 
tained by an annual subscription from the constituent 
chambers. It has been instrumental in passing many useful acts 
of parliament, and in otherwise influencing legislation upon com- 
mercial topics. The general meetings, which are held annually 
in March, in London, and at which delegates are present from all 
parts of the country, have come to be considered as a kind of parlia- 
ment of trade, and representatives of the Board of Trade, the general 
post office, and the foreign and colonial offices arc generally in 
attendance. Special meetings take place in September, and are 
held in provincial towns on the invitation of the local chamber.

TRADE ORGANIZATION 



Chambers 
Abroad* 



The association has limited its work to the United Kingdom, 
and has not taken advantage of the commercial development of the 
colonies to afford colonial interests an opportunity of voicing their 
needs in the metropolis. To supply this need the London Chamber 
of Commerce has, from time to time, organized congresses of 
chambers of commerce of the empire. Some of these congresses 
have been held in the colonies, the first being at Montreal in 1903. 

The home organization of chambers of commerce is supplemented 
by a few British chambers which have been established in foreign 
countries. These institutions are self-supporting, and not, 
as seems often to be thought, branches of, or subsidized 
or controlled by home chambers. The British Chamber 
of Commerce in Paris, which is the oldest of them, dates 
from 1 873, and wasoriginally established by British merchants in Paris 
for the defence of their own trade interests. Its scope soon extended, 
however, and it admitted to membership British firms trading with 
France although not resident m France, and in course of time became 
representative of general British commercial interests in the French 
markets. Other British chambers are to be found in Genoa, Alexan- 
dria, Barcelona, Constantinople and St Petersburg. In Brussels] an 
Anglo-American chamber jointly represents British and American 
interests. Several countries are represented in London by 
chambers of commerce, while the American Chamber (Liverpool), 

- the Anglo-Belgian, the Anglo-Portuguese, the Aus- 
rtTh tralasian, the Italian, the Norwegian and the Swedish 
Chambers In Cambers are members of the Association of Chambers 
England. of Commerce of the United Kingdom. The United 
States are represented in England by the American Chamber of 
Commerce in Liverpool. 

Commercial organization in the colonies is very much on the 
same footing as it is in the United Kingdom. The most representa- 

- ; ; tive associations are the chambers of commerce, whose 
rL f constitution and functions are similar to those of the 
Chambers. Brit ; sh chambers. In Canada the chambers, which 
are also sometimes called Boards of Trade, after the American 
custom, number over sixty, the most important being the Montreal 
and Toronto Boards of Trade and the Quebec Chamber of Commerce. 
The Canadian chambers have no association, but hold periodical 
conferences. There is, in addition, the Canadian Manufacturers' 
Association, with headquarters in Toronto and branches in all the 
provinces, which incorporates all the associations of manufacturers 
in the Dominion. The Australian chambers of commerce, which 
number some thirty, have joined into an association called the 
General Council of the Chambers of Commerce of the Commonwealth 
of Australia. In New Zealand, South Africa, India and many 
British colonies there are chambers of commerce in all the more 
important towns. 

b. A ssociations Representing Particular Trades. — Associations 
representative of particular trades are almost innumerable. The 
London General Shipowners' Society, the Liverpool Shipowners' 
Association, the North of England Shipowners and Steamship 
Owners' Associations may be^ mentioned as representative. The 
chambers of shipping and shipowners' associations joined forces 
in 1878 in order to establish the Chamber of Shipping of the United 
Kingdom, which does for them what the Association of Chambers 
of Commerce does for chambers of commerce. # The Iron 
and Steel Institute affords a means of communication between 
members of the iron and steel trades, while the British Iron Trade 
Association is one of the most powerful. The nature of other 
associations is sufficiently indicated by their titles. In addition 
there are the Cotton Association, the Drapers' Chamber of Trade, 
the Fish Trade Association, the Sugar Refiners' Committee, various 
tea planters' associations, the Oil Seed Association, the Petroleum 
Defence Committee, the Mansion House Association on Railway 
and Canal Traffic, &c. 

c. Trade Protection Societies. — These seem to be, on the whole, 
more ancient bodies than chambers of commerce. In the early 
part of the 19th century they were already strongly organized, 
especially in the West Riding of Yorkshire. Outside of that district 
the Dublin Society was the most important. They number more 
than 100 throughout the United Kingdom. 

The Manchester Guardian Society, which dates from 1826, 
occupies a position of special prominencein the Midlands, and may 
be taken as the model of such associations. Its objects are-^the 
maldng of private inquiries as to the respectability and credit of 
traders, the detection and exposure of swindlers; the collection of 
debts; the winding-up of insolvent estates; the issue of notices of 
bills of sale, judgments, bankruptcies, &c; and generally the im- 
provement of laws and regulations affecting trade. The society 
has over 6000 members, and its usefulness may be gauged by the 
fact that it answers an average of 40,000 credit inquiries every year. 

Trade protection societies formed themselves, as early as 1848, 
into an association, which was at first an association of secretaries, 
but in 1865 was transformed into an association of societies. 
The association issues a quarterly journal called the Trade 
Protection Journal. 

B. — Slate Departmental Organizations. 
Although the British government allowed commercial organi- 
zations within its jurisdiction to grow independently of official 



control, it does not follow that it took no interest in the protec- 
tion and promotion of British trade and the dissemination of 
commercial intelligence. As long ago as the reign of Charles II. 
the body which is now the British equivalent of what is known 
in most countries as the ministry of commerce, viz. the board 
of trade, was established. The commercial jurisdiction of 
the Board of Trade does not extend beyond the limits of the 
United Kingdom, but the Foreign Office, through the negotiation 
of commercial treaties and by means of the consular body, 
came into touch with international trade. With the develop- 
ment of the colonies, the colonial and India offices also found 
themselves called upon to act, to a certain extent, as guardians 
of commercial rights and channels for the dissemination of 
commercial intelligence. But when competition began to 
displace British goods from foreign markets, and when the 
British trader noticed the efforts which were being made by 
foreign governments for the promotion of trade, he came to 
the conclusion that the British government was not doing 
anything for him. 

Complaints were especially loud against the consuls, who were 
accused! of systematically disregarding commercial interests, whilst 
their American, German, French and Belgian colleagues cons 1 
did not consider it below their dignity to take advantage service** 
of their position, in order to promote the trade of the 
country they represented. British Consular Reports were also 
unfavourably compared with those issued by foreign consuls, notably 
the American. The result was that, in 1886, instructions were issued 
to the consular service which, for the completeness and fairness 
with which they deal with the subject, have frequently been quoted 
as models which might advantageously be followed (see Parlia- 
mentary Paper, Commercial, No. 16, 1886). The preparation of con- 
sular reports, however, continued to be most unfavourably criticised, 
and frequent instructions were issued by the foreign office in regard 
to them. The whole question was raised again in 1896, when, as 
the result of lengthy communications between the Foreign Office 
on the one hand, and the Association of Chambers of Commerce 
and the London chamber on the other, fresh instructions were sent 
to British consuls, reiterating the instructions of 1886. 

The consular service has of late years been supplemented by the 
appointment of commercial attaches. 

The pressure exercised by the chambers of commerce upon the 
government led to the appointment in 1897 of a departmental 
committee on the dissemination of commercial intelli- 
gence, which was charged with considering means of Commercial 
more adequately supplying traders with commercial Intelligence 
information, of improving consular and colonial reports, thelioara' ot 
and with reporting on the advisability of appointing frade. 
commercial agents to the colonies and establishing a com- 
mercial intelligence office. The chief result of the committee's recom - 
mendations was the establishment of the commercial intelligence 
branch of the Board of Trade. It publishes the Board of Trade 
Journal weekly. Attached to the branch is an advisory committee, 
composed of representatives of the various government departments 
and of the Association of Chambers of Commerce. 

The scope of the commercial intelligence branch was further 
increased, and its means of action strengthened, by the transfer of 
the Imperial Institute to the Board of Trade, which was effected 
in 1902 by the passing of a private act of parliament. 

The self-governing colonies are represented in London by agents- 
general (q.v.), while the commercial interests of the crown colonies 
are in the hands of the crown agents for the colonies. 

II. — United States of America 
A. — Commercial Associations. 
American trade organizations have been developed mainly on 
the lines of the British system. Of the associations which come 
within the scope of this article, the most important are the 
chambers of commerce, which in certain cases are called boards 
of trade. Theoretically there is a distinction between the two, 
chambers of commerce being entrusted with the protection of 
general commercial interests, especially in connexion with 
foreign trade, whilst boards of trade look after local commercial 
questions. But in practice the difference is of no importance, 
as chambers of commerce take cognisance of local as well as 
international trade matters, and the boards of trade in no way 
limit the sphere of their activity to purely American questions. 

The oldest American commercial organization is the New York 
Chamber of Commerce, which was founded in 1768, and incorporated 
by royal charter in 1770. In the words of its charter, its object 
was " to carry into execution, encourage and promote by just and 
lawful ways and means such measures as will tend to promote and 



TRADE ORGANIZATION 



137 






extend just and lawful commerce." It was the prototype of all 
the other chambers of commerce and boards of trade which have 
since been established in the United States, and which are said to 
exceed 1000 in number. American trade organizations are associated 
in a National Board of Trade, which corresponds to the Association 
of Chambers oi Commerce of the United Kingdom. ^ The objects 
of this institution are to secure unity and harmony* of action m 
reference to commercial questions, and to obtain, through its 
representative character, more satisfactory consideration of the 
matters which it brings under the notice either of the Federal govern- 
ment or of the local state administrations. The expenses of the 
National Board of Trade are defrayedout of a fund formed by the 
subscriptions of the various associations belonging to it. The 
United §tates has a number of chambers of commerce established 
in foreign countries. The first institution of this kind was started 
so long ago as 1801, when the American Chamber of Commerce 
in Liverpool was established. This chamber is the only one repre- 
senting American commercial interests in the United Kingdom, 
there being no association of this nature in London. The American 
Chamber of Commerce in Paris is one of the most active, important 
and representative foreign associations pn the continent of Europe. 
In some places where neither the American nor the British element 
is strong enough to maintain separate associations (notably in 
Brussels), they have joined hands to support an Anglo-American 
Chamber of Commerce, which is found to work fairly satisfactorily. 
The American commercial museums, although of recent founda- 
tion, have attracted much notice owing to the practical and business- 
like manner in which they are conducted, and are considered to be 
among the best equipped institutions of this nature. Those in 
Philadelphia and at San^ Francisco are the best known. The 
Philadelphia museum, which came first and is better known, was 
established by an ordinance of the municipality m 1894, and is 
supported by subscriptions and by municipal subsidies, administered 
by a board of trustees, who are appointed for life and serve without 
remuneration. The work of the museum is supervised by an advisory 
board, composed of representatives of the principal ^ commercial 
organizations in the United States. Its objects are to assist American 
manufacturers and merchants in securing wider foreign markets 
for their products, to aid them in forming connexions abroad, and 
to bring foreign buyers in touch with them. One of the chief ways 
in which this is done is by means of an index file of foreign customers 
supplied to American manufacturers, and vice versa. ^ In addition to 
the regular service to members, the museum also maintains abroad, 
in various cities, index files covering some sixty American trades 
or trade divisions, containing the names of American manufacturers 
of standing, with full particulars of their various lines of manufacture. 
These files are generally entrusted to chambers of commerce, or 
similar commercial institutions, and are placed gratuitously at the 
disposal of foreign manufacturers and merchants. The Philadelphia 
museum has also a most valuable library and a museum of samples. 

B. — State Departmental Organization. 

The American state organization for dealing with commercial 
matters lacks the theoretical completeness of the organization 
of most European states, but is nevertheless found to give satis- 
faction. Official control is exercised through various bureaus 
placed, for the most part, under the treasury department. 
The most important of these are: the interstate commerce 
commission, which deals with matters affecting the inland 
trade; the industrial commission, which looks chiefly after 
manufacturing; and the fishery bureau. Foreign commercial 
matters come within the cognisance of the bureau of foreign 
commerce, a section of the state department which also controls 
the consular body, and sees to the publication of their reports and 
to the dissemination of foreign commercial intelligence. The 
state department corresponds to the British foreign office. 

The Pan-American Union, until^io called the Bureau of Amer- 
ican Republics, was established in 1889, as a result of the Pan- 
American Conference called together in that year by the late James 
G. Blaine, secretary of state at that time. This bureau, which 
had its office in Washington, is supported by a contribution from all 
the republics of North, Central and South America, which is fixed 
at the rate of 1000 dollars a year per million inhabitants. Its 
object is the dissemination of trustworthy commercial information 
concerning the republics of the American continent, and in pursu- 
ance of this object it has issued a large variety of publications. 

The American consular service has been frequently pointed out 
as a model to be followed in connexion with commercial matters. 
Consular America, contrary to the European practice, has no 
Service. consuts de carriere. # Her consular representatives are 
appointed for a period of, as a rule, four years, and 
are selected m preference from commercial circles. Their work, as 
compared with that of British consuls, is rather limited, and they 
have nothing to monopolize their time like the shipping interests 
with which the British consular body is entrusted in most countries. 
Since 1898 the bureau of foreign commerce issues consular reports 



daily, as fast as they are received, and circulates them in advance 
sheets, printed on one side of the paper only, like printers' proofs. 
They are afterwards republished in permanent form. 

The American consular body, which numbers some 400 members, 
and is exclusively composed of American citizens, is distributed 
according to the commercial importance of towns. 

III. — France 
A. — Commercial Associations. 

The French government was the- first to elaborate a regular 
system of trade organizations, which it endeavoured to make 
as complete as possible. This system comprises: — : 

a. Chambers of commerce; 

6. Consultative chambers of arts and manufactures; and 

c. Syndical chambers of trade and industry. 

a. Chambers ^ of Commerce. — Chambers of commerce owe their 
origin to the city of Marseilles, where, in 1599, the town council, 
which had hitherto looked after the commercial interests o r M„ 

of the city, found it no longer possible to combine com- 
mercial with municipal functions, and established an association 
which it called the " Chamber of Commerce " to take up the com- 
mercial part of its duties. This seems to be the first time that the 
title was used. The new chamber soon became a most important 
body, and in 1650, during the minority of Louis XIV., lettres 
patentes were granted to it. It settled the law merchant and 
the customs of the port, was entrusted with the appointment of 
consuls and the control of French consulates in the Levant, fitted 
out expeditions against corsairs, owned fleets, sent embassies to 
the Barbaresque countries, organized commercial missions, &c. 
Its ordinary budget, at one time, amounted to over one million 
Hvres. Louis XIV. conceived the idea of a system of organizations 
which, whilst not being allowed to become so dangerously power- 
ful as that oi Marseilles, would nevertheless be useful in other 
towns, and in 1700 he caused an arrete to be published, ordering 
the creation of chambers^ of commerce, which were entrusted with 
the nomination of deputiesto the Royal Council of Commerce 
which had just been created in Paris. Chambers were consequently 
established in Lyons, Rouen, Toulouse, Montpellier, Bordeaux, La 
Rochelle, Lille, Bayonne, Amiens, &c. These bodies, however, 
did not exercise much influence under the monarchy. Including 
the Marseilles chamber, they were suppressed, with all trade 
gilds and other trade associations, in 1789. Napoleon re-established 
the chambers by decree of the 24th of December 1802, and endowed 
them with a constitution similar, in essential particulars, to the one 
they have at present, which has served as a model for chambers 
of commerce on the Continent, but he submitted them to a uni- 
form and narrow administrative jurisdiction which practically 
deprived them of all initiative. 

They are now regulated by the law of the 9th of April 1898, 
which codified, altered and completed previous legislation on the 
subject. Under this law, chambers of commerce can „ ... 
only be established by a decree countersigned by the ,.°*J S a ' 
minister of commerce, upon the advice of the municipal 
council of the place where the chamber is to be, of the general 
council of the department, and of the existing chambers of com- 
merce of the district. The members of chambers of commerce 
used to be elected by the " Notables Commercants,"^ who were a 
body of commercial electors selected by the prefects in accordance 
with the provisions of the Code of Commerce. They were abolished 
by law in 1871, but those who were then entitled to the designation 
still continue to use it, which explains the words " Notable Com- 
mer£ant," so puzzling to foreigners in French commercial directories 
and on French business cards. At present, commercial houses pay- 
ing patente — which is a special tax upon people engaged *in trade 
— elect the members of the chamber, the number of whom is fixed 
for each chamber by the miniscer of commerce. 

Their functions, which are consultative and administrative, are 
set out in part ii. of the law of 1898. The government is bound 
to take their opinion regarding the regulation of com- p UBC ti 0BS 
mercial usages, the establishment of public institutions 
of a commercial or financial nature, and of tribunals of commerce, 
the improvement of transport and communications, the applica- 
tion of laws of a local character, the sale price of prison-made 
goods and the tariff for prison labour, and local public works, and 
loans or taxation in connexion therewith. On the other hand, 
they are allowed to submit observations to the government, with- 
out being asked, on proposed changes in the commercial or economic* 
legislation of the country; on customs tariffs and regulations; on 
railway, canal and river rates; and on transport regulations. As 
regards their administrative functions, they may be authorized to 
establish and administer such institutions as bonded warehouses, 
public sale-rooms, fire-arm testing establishments, conditioning 
rooms for wool, silk, textiles, paper, &c, commercial, professional, 
or technical schools and museums, &c. They may be granted 
concessions for public works, and may undertake the carrying out 
of public services, especially in regard to the ports, docks, canals 
and navigable rivers in their district, and be authorized to issue 
loans for the purpose.

TRADE ORGANIZATION 



Constltw 
tton. 



Previous to 1898 it was illegal for chambers of commerce to hold 
joint meetings for the discussion of matters of public interest, and 
they were not even allowed to correspond or consult in anyway, 
except through the medium of the minister of commerce. The 
new law relaxed to a certain extent this prohibition, by authorizing 
direct correspondence and permitting chambers in a district to 
meet for the joint consideration of questions affecting their district,' 
but for no other purpose. ^ Such a^ thing as an association of 
chambers of commerce is still illegal in France.. 

When, in 1873, British merchants in Paris started a British 
chamber of commerce in the French capital, the French govern- 
French nient looked rather askance at the new venture, and M. 

Chambers of h^ on . ^ a ^» when minister of commerce, even threatened 
Commerce ** w * tn f° rc ible dissolution unless the title " Chamber 
Abroad. °^ Commerce " was dropped. This demand was not 
ultimately pressed, and the services rendered by, the 
British chamber soon opened the eyes of the French government 
to the advantages^ which they might derive from the formation 
of similar institutions to represent French commercial interests 
abroad. In 1883 the minister of commerce started the organization 
of such chambers, which endeavoured to combine to a certain 
extent the French and the British systems. 

Foreign commercial interests are represented in Paris by seven 
foreign chambers of commerce, of which the British Chamber is 
;the oldest. The others are the American, Austro- 
JJ™^ .Hungarian, Belgian, Italian, Spanish and Russian 
C mm , chambers. In 1896 these chambers formed them- 

In Paris™ se ^ ves mt0 an Association of Foreign Chambers of 
Commerce, but the French government gave it to be 
understood that, as they did not allow associations of French 
chambers, they could not treat foreign bodies more favourably, 
and the association had to be dissolved. 

b. Consultative Chambers of Arts and Manufactures. — These 
institutions, organized somewhat after the model of chambers of 

commerce, represent manufacturing and industrial 
interests. They were established by Napoleon I. in 
1 803 , and formed part of the complete system of 
commercial organizations which he intended to give France. They 
are now regulated by decrees of 1852 and 1863, and are composed 
of twelve members elected for six years by merchants and manu- 
facturers inscribed upon an electoral list specially drawn up by 
the prefects. These chambers, of which there are some fifty in 
existence, are placed under the control of the minister of commerce, 
but instead of being kept out of the patentes t like chambers of 
commerce, they^ are supported by the municipality of the town 
where they are situated, which has also to provide them with offices 
rent free, and wkh clerical assistance. In addition to giving 
Pi cti advice in connexion with manufacturing and industrial 

Functions* matters> they have to look after and report upon im- 
provements in manufactures and machinery, new industrial pro- 
cesses, &c. They are especially useful in the preparation of local 
and international exhibitions. They are also entrusted with the 
nomination of the Consultative Committee of Arts and Manufactures, 
a body whose functions are to advise the ministers of commerce 
and finance, as well as those of the interior and of public works, 
as regards the regulation of dangerous trades and industries, patents 
and trade marks legislation, and the interpretation of customs 
regulations. 

c. Syndical Chambers^ of Trade and Industry. — By the side of 
the official trade organizations other associations have grown up, 
which, although regulated by t law, are in the nature of voluntary 
and self-supporting bodies, viz. the syndical chambers of trade 
and industry. The repeal in 1884 of the law of 1791, which pro- 
hibited the formation of trade or professional association, was the 
signal for the formation of those chambers, which soon acquired 
great influence. A few syndical chambers existed before that 
date, the oldest, the Chamber of Master Builders, dating back as 
far as 1809, but they were only tolerated, and their existence, 
being illegal, was most precarious. 

The syndical chambers, which are divided into chambers of 
employers and chambers of employed, are the official organs and 
Canstftu representatives of the trade and professional syndicates 
tlon authorized by the law of the 31st of March 1884, which 

was the work of M. Waldeck-Rousseau. Each syndicate 
has its separate chamber. They may be established without 
government authorization, but a copy of their rules and^ a list of 
their officials must be sent to the prefect. Membership is strictly 
limited to persons of French nationality. The only way in which 
the government t can dissolve them is by application to the courts 
of justice for an'order of dissolution on the ground of infringement 
of the provisions of the law. In Paris, most of the syndical chambers 
have formed an association . called the Union Nationale du 
Commerce etde l'lndustrie — Alliance des Chambres Syndicates. 
Another association, intended to take up the defence of the interests 
and rights of syndical chambers, has been formed under the title of 
Syndicat du Commerce et de l'lndustrie — Syndicat des Chambres 
Syndicales. The syndical chambers are kept up by the subscrip- 
tions of their members, and have the right to nolo real property, 
as have also the associations of chambers, which are kept up by 
subscriptions from the constituent chambers. 



According to the law which authorized their formation, the 
objects of the syndical chambers are exclusively " the study 
and defence of economic, industrial, commercial and p .. 
agricultural interests," and for this purpose they have ** uoctJoaSt 
complete freedom of intercommunication and can hold congresses. 
They are authorized to establish for their members mutual benefit 
societies and* pension and relief funds, to open employment agencies, 
to give legal advice to, and in certain cases to bring actions on behalf 
of their members, and to organize the settlement of disputes by 
arbitration. They take part in the election of judges of the tri- 
bunals of commerce and of the Conseils de Prud'hommes. 

B. — State Departmental Organization. 

The state commercial departments and offices are chiefly 
centred round the ministry of commerce, to which is assigned the 
commercial part of the duties fulfilled in England by 
the board of trade. A ministry of commerce existed commTrce. 
for short periods in 1811 and in 1828, but it was 
ultimately suppressed in 1829, and from that date until 1886, 
when the department received its present form and separate 
existence, commerce was only represented, in the French govern- 
ment by a subsidiary bureau attached sometimes to one ministry, 
sometimes to another. The ministry is divided into three main 
hureaus — the first entrusted with all matters connected with 
the home trade and industry, the second with foreign and colonial 
relations, and the third with the compilation of statistics. 

Attached to the ministry of commerce is a body called the 
Conseil Superieur du Commerce et de l'lndustrie, which acts as 
an advisory council to the minister. Its origin goes back to the 
council of commerce established by Louis XIV., but it is now regu- 
lated by a decree of 1882. 

The Office National du Commerce Exterieur was established by 
a law of the 4th of March 1898, and is carried on jointly by the 
ministry of commerce and the chamber of commerce 
of Pans, the latter having provided it with an in- yfifir 
stallation at a cost of over 1,200,000 francs. The p J or 
office, which has^ been founded for the promotion of ~ 0/ *?° 
French trade with foreign countries and the dis- ra e * 

semination of commercial intelligence, fulfils duties similar to those 
of the commercial intelligence branch of the board of trade. It 
also publishes the weekly Moniteur^ officiel du commerce. 

The Office Colonial, whose duties are especially to furnish in- 
formation concerning the French colonies, to promote emigration 
thither, and to foster a demand in France for the nff . 
produce of her colonies, was established by a decree rit / 
of the 14th of March 1899. It is entrusted, in addition, Co/011/a/ ' 
with a permanent exhibition of colonial produce and a museum 
of samples of goods supplied by or required in the colonies. The 
office is also in charge of a colonial garden at Vincennes, where 
experiments are made for the acclimatization of colonial plants 
and produce in France, and the cultivation of French produce in 
the colonies. ^ The office publishes a monthly bulletin of miscel- 
laneous colonial information, and issues yearly commercial and other 
reports dealing with the colonies. It is a dependency of the ministry 
of the colonies. 

French consuls are instructed to transmit to their government 
all information which they may consider useful for the prosperity 
of French trade. It is also their duty to spread, in the country where 
they reside, a knowledge of such French commercial and financial 
matters as they may consider most useful in the interests of their 
own country. The < close relations which they are ; 

recommended to cultivate withthe French commercial wnsu ar 
community within their jurisdiction through the ery &• 
local French chamber of commerce and the councillors of foreign 
trade are intended to enable them to keep in better touch with 
commercial questions. They have had, however, to be frequently 
reminded of their commercial duties, and the French chambers 
of commerce have criticized them almost as much as the British 
chambers have British consuls. The mpst important instructions 
issued to consuls were contained in circulars from the minister 
for foreign affairs dated the 15th of March and the^th of April 
1883. French consuls have to make a return to their government 
every fortnight — every month if the district is not of great commer- 
cial importance — showing, upon forms specially provided,the nature, 
quantity, origin or destination, prices wholesale and retail, and chief 
trade marks of the goods imported into and exported from the 
district, the results of public sales of produce, the conditions of 
transport, contemplated public works and tenders advertised, 
state of the labour market, artistic enterprises, commercial failures 
and rumours < concerning important local firms, effect of foreign 
competition, imitation of French trade marks,&c. These returns 
are mostly of a confidential nature, and are not intended for publica- 
tion, but whenever the minister considers it advisable he causes 
information to be conveyed through the chambers of commerce, or 
other channels, to the parties^ chiefly interested. The ordinary 
consular reports are published in weekly instalments in the Mont- 
teur officiel du commerce. 



TRADE ORGANIZATION 



J 39 



IV. Germany 
A. — Commercial Associations. 
German trade organizations are of three kinds, viz.: — 

a. Official organizations established by law, and called Handels- 
kammern, or chamber of commerce; 

b. Semi-official associations; and 

c. Voluntary or " free " associations. 

a. Chambers of Commerce. — Contrary to the idea prevalent in 
England, official trade organizations in Germany are in a somewhat 
chaotic state. They have been established under more or less 
different conditions and systems in each state of the empire, and 
in certain districts still bear the imprint of foreign origin. They 
are under the control of the local state governments and lack the 
homogeneity and unity of direction of the French official system. 

Before proceeding _ to a general examination of the German 
regime, special mention must be made of the chambers of com- 
H tic merce °^ * ne °ld Hanseatic Confederacy which stand 

Ors&nUa* a P art ' am * whose duties, as well as constitution, differ 
J~ a * from those of trade organizations in the^ rest of Ger- 
many. The chambers of commerce in Hamburg, 
Bremen and Lubeck are not only the successors of, but (con- 
trary to what happened in Germany as well as in other 
countries) have been evolved out of the old corporations which 
looked after the interests of the Hans traders in the olden days, 
and which, in the case of the Hamburg " Commerz-Deputation," 
ior instance, dated as far back as 1665. 

The Hamburg Chamber of Commerce, whose present constitution 
dates from i860, is composed of twenty-four members elected for 
six years by the ancient " Versammlung eines ehrbaren Kauf- 
mannes," that is to say, the merchants and commercial men whose 
names appear on the register of the " Honest Merchants " of the 
city. Its income is chiefly derived from special taxation, to which 
are added the proceeds of the sale of contract and transfer stamps, 
and also the amount paid every year for the re-registration of 
each " Honest Merchant." This latter source of income amounts 
to about 70,000 marks per annum. The chamber has to submit 
its accounts for approval to the Senate of the Republic. 

In addition to the general duties of chambers of commerce in 
connexion with trade matters, the Hamburg chamber — the same 
may also be said of the other Hanseatic chambers — fulfils the 
combined functions of a chamber of shipping and of a port and 
docks board. It has the right of proposing judges and of nominat- 
ing experts attached to the courts. The exchanges and public 
sale rooms of the city are under its control, and it publishes the 
official quotations, as well as a weekly price list of goods and pro- 
duce at the port of Hamburg. It is entitled to elect members to 
the " Burgerschaft " or lower house of representatives, who are 
especially competent to deal with trade and shipping questions, 
customs duties and emigration. The chamber must be consulted 
by the " Burgerschaft " with reference to all proposals affecting 
trade and navigation. 

In Bremen the chamber is composed of twenty-four members 
elected by the " Ausschuss des Kaufmanns-Konvents, " which com- 
prises all the important commercial houses of the city. Two 
members go out every year, and no one can remain a member for 
more than eighteen years. The Bremen chamber is intimately con- 
nected with the Senate of the Republic, a standing committee of 
both being in existence to settle questions affecting trade and 
navigation. 

< The Lubeck chamber is composed of twenty members elected for 
six years by the associations representing the wholesale and retail 
trades. The president must be approved by the senate, and is 
sworn in as a state official. He holds office for two years, and is 
not paid for his services, but when he goes out of office is pre- 
sented with a sumof money subscribed by the townspeople. The 
Lubeck chamber is probably the wealthiest organization of its 
kind in Germany, and is entrusted with the administration of the 
propertv of the old corporation of the " Vorstand der Kaufmann- 
schaft, ' which is very important. The senate must consult it not 
only in trade and navigation matters, but also with reference to 
all contracts entered into on behalf of the state. 

Chambers of commerce in other parts of the German Empire are 
not so important, nor are their duties so varied, as in the Hanseatic 
Chambers of f owns * The oldest ones were established by Napoleon 
Commerce, m I ^ 02 m Cologne, Crefeld, Aachen, Stolberg and 
other towns which were then under the control of 
France, and they were submitted to the legislation which regu- 
lated the chambers organized in France at the same time. The 
model set up by the French was more or less closely followed in 
the subsequent establishment of institutions of this nature in other 
German states. The Berlin chamber was only constituted on the 
1st of April 1902. A trade corporation called the " Aelteste der 
Kaufmannschaft " previously fulfilled, to a certain extent, the 
duties of a chamber of commerce. The new chamber rests on a 
broader basis than the old corporation, which, however, remains 
intact, though the sphere of its action has been restricted. 

Broadly speaking, the German chambers are elected by the 
registered tradespeople and the merchants. Throughout the whole 



of Germany chambers are under the strict supervision of the state 
minister 01 commerce, and cannot be established except with his 
permission. He fixes the number of members as well as the amount 
of the state allocation to the chamber. In Prussia and Bavaria 
the government is entitled to dissolve chambers whenever it 
considers it advisable to do so, and there is always a government 
commissioner in attendance at all meetings. In most cases the 
local government allows a fixed sum for the expenses of chambers 
of commerce, and if this amount is exceeded the electors who are 
on the t commercial register have to make good the excess by 
the striking of a special rate. In some states, e.g. Brunswick, 
Wurttemberg and Baden, the electors cannot be called upon to 
pay for deficiencies more than an amount fixed by law. In Bavaria 
chambers v get a subvention from the district and central funds. 

The duties and powers of the German chambers are practically 
the same as those of the French chambers. 

The German government did not, like the French, interfere with 
the liberty of association of chambers of commerce, and as a 
result German chambers have united, together with other trade 
corporations, in an association called the " Deutsche Handelstag," 
founded in 1861, and carried on in its present form since 1886. 
t The German government is understood to be opposed to the forma- 
tion of German chambers of commerce abroad, and as a German 
matter of fact there are no German chambers in Europe Chambers 
outside of Germany. A few have been established Abroad and 
in South America, but they are purely voluntary Foreign 
associations. No foreign chambers of commerce exist Chambers in 
in Germany. Germany, 

b. Semi-Qfficial Corporations. — Besides the chambers of com- 
merce, there exist, chiefly in Prussia, various old-established and 
quasi-official corporations, whose views receive as careful con- 
sideration from the government as do those of chambers of com- 
merce. The Berliner Aelteste der Kaufmannschaft is one of the 
most important of these corporations, but the Gewerbekammer of 
Memel, the Kaufmannische Verein of Breslau, the Vorsteher 
Amt der Kaufmannschaft of Koenigsberg also deserve mention. 
Others exist in Elbing, Stettin, Danzig, Tilsit and Magdeburg. 
They originated for the most part in ancient gilds or associations 
of commercial firms, and were organized in their present form 
between 1820 and 1825. 

c. Voluntary Associations. — Germany nossesses also a large 
number of influential commercial associations of a voluntary 
character called the " Freie Vereine," which, especially in recent 
years, have greatly contributed to the commercial development of 
the empire. 

B. — State Departmental Organization. 

The German Empire has no ministry of commerce. As in the 
United States, commercial matters form only a department of the 
ministry of state. Most of the states of the empire have, how- 
ever, their own ministries of commerce, the oldest being the 
Prussian ministry of commerce and industry, which dates from 
1848. 

In Prussia, the minister of commerce is advised by the Volks-. 
wirthpehaftsrath, or council of national economy, an official body 
constituted in 1880 by the Emperor William I. The - 
functions of this council, which < assembles periodic- ^ ussi f n 
ally under the presidency of the minister of commerce, TP'Jf ? 
are also similar to those fulfilled in France by the ™ aoaaI 
Conseil Superieur du Commerce et de 1' Industrie. economy. 

The German government has taken steps to facilitate the dis- 
semination of commercial intelligence by the establishment of 
commercial museums, which are variously called „ . . 

" Handelsmuseen, " "Ausfuhrmusterlager " or " E x-^? mm€rcIaI 
portmusterlager. " The first of these, which are on the S€ums ' 
model of the Vienna Handelsmuseum, was opened in Berlin in 1883. 
Others followed in Munich, Karlsruhe, Frankfort, Cologne, Dresden* 
Leipzig, Weimar, &c. They perform, to a certain extent, much 
the same functions as those performed in England by the com- 
mercial intelligence branch of the board of trade. 

A perusal of the instructions given to German consuls with 
regard to commercial matters shows that the German consular body 
is in this respect very much in the same position as 
the British consular body. If German consuls as a Consular 
whole have been especially active and successful in ervIce * 
promoting German commercial interests, it is not on account of 
the nature of the instructions received from their government, 
these instructions being to all intents- and purposes similar to those 
issued to British consuls, but because particular care was taken 
to select consuls from a class of men imbued with the desire of 
increasing the greatness of their country by the promotion of German 
trade. t 

Of distinctly commercial attaches, like those of Great Britain and 
Russia, Germany has none; but in addition to the consular body 
she is represented in foreign countries by five attacn ^ s 4- / * w // Ifra | 
or experts, whose duties are to study the movements of Ju iacn ^ St 
agricultural produce, and interest themselves in agri- 
cultural matters generally. They cover Great Britain, France, 
Russia, the Danube district and the United States.

TRADE UNIONS 



V. — Belgium 
A. — Commercial Associations. 

The important place which Belgium has taken in international 
trade has directed much attention to her commercial organization, 
which comes nearer to the British model than that of any other 
European country. Belgian chambers of commerce were on the 
French system until 1875, when all official ties between them and 
the government were broken, and full liberty was given to com- 
mercial associations to establish and govern themselves in their 
own way. The Belgian chambers have now no administrative 
functions of any kind, but the Belgian government never fails to 
consult them in matters likely to interest the commercial com- 
munity. The most important chambers are those of Antwerp, 
Brussels, Ghent, Liege, Charlcroi, Vcrviers and Namur. Mention 
should also be made of the. federations of industrial and com- 
mercial associations at Antwerp and at Brussels, and of the 
syndical union of Brussels. In some places there are Liberal and 
Conservative chambers of commerce. 

In addition to institutions representative of the general interests 
of commerce and industry, the principal trades have also in the 
larger cities separate associations or syndicates. There are a large 
number of associations for the promotion of colonial trade, which 
have grown up since the establishment of the Congo Free State. A 
number of Belgian chambersof commerce also exist abroad, the 
first of which was established in New York in 1867. 

B. — State Departmental Organization. 

The Belgian ministry of commerce, under whose control com- 
mercial matters are placed, dates only from 1895, previous to which 
time the department of commerce at the^ ministry for foreign 
affairs fulfilled the same functions. The ministry has established 
in Brussels a Commercial Museum, similar to those of Germany 
and Austria, to centralize commercial intelligence and facilitate its 
dissemination. 

VI. — Other Countries 

Austria-Hungary. — The control exercised by the government 
over commercial organizations in Austria and in Hungary is very 
close. The only institutions of this kind of any importance within 
the dual monarchy are the chambers of commerce. They are 
official bodies, regulated by the law of the 29th of June 1868, 
which is, as regards the functions^ of chambers, almost similar to 
the French law. But the Austrian chambers, in certain cases, 
have the right to elect members of parliament, which right depends 
upon taxation. Within the - Trieste district one-third of the 
members of chambers of commerce may be foreigners. 

Austria and Hungary have each a ministry of commerce, the 
former since 1853 and the latter since 1867, whose jurisdiction is 
strictly confined to internal trade matters in each country. When- 
ever important questions arise affecting common interests the 
Gemeinsame Zoll-Conferenz, or Common Customs Conference, is 
summoned. _ This conference is made up of representatives of the 
various ministries of both countries. Matters arising out of com- 
mercial relations with foreign countries are under the control of 
the commercial department of the imperial foreign office. 

The Vienna commercial museum was the prototype of similar 
institutions. It was established in 1875, as a consequence of the 
Vienna International Exhibition of 1873, and was followed shortly 
afterwards by the establishment of a similar one in Budapest. 

Italy. — The chambers of commerce and arts, which arc regu- 
lated by the law of 1862, are official bodies. They are instituted, 
and may be dissolved, by royal decree, and their functions are 
almost similar to those performed by the French chambers. They 
are, however, at liberty to unite for the consideration of commercial 
and industrial questions of common interest, and are entitled to 
own property and to levy taxes for their maintenance. 

An advisory council is attached to the ministry of commerce, 
which dates from 1878. This council is called upon to give an 
opinion with reference to all matters connected with trade and 
industry. There are also two commercial museums, one in Rome and 
one in^ Milan. 

Spain* — Spanish chambers of commerce were organized by a 
royal decree of 1886, which places them under the control of the 
Ministro de Fomento. They are self-supporting bodies with un- 
limited membership, but have also an official standing. In order 
to belong to them one must be of Spanish nationality, be engaged 
in trade, have paid direct taxes to the state for at least five years 
for the business in connexion with which membership of the chamber 
is^ sought, and pay annually the amount of the subscription pro- 
vided by the regulations. # The government must consult chambers 
of commerce upon treaties of commerce and navigation, tariff 
changes, the creation of commercial exchanges and the organization 
oi t commercial education. Owing to the peculiarity of their con- 
stitution the Spanish chambers are much more representative of 
the feelings of the commercial community, and much less under 
the strict control of the government, than similar institutions in 
other continental countries. Spain has no ministry of commerce 
proper, the duties of this office being performed by the commercial 
sub-department of the Ministro de Fomento, which dates from 
1847. 



Portugal. — In Portugal the organizations corresponding to 
chambers of commerce, which are called '* commercial associa- 
tions, " are voluntary associations kept up by the subscriptions of 
their members. The associations at Lisbon and Oporto are the 
only ones of importance. 

Russia.— Attached to the department of trade and manufactures 
of the ministry of Finance, which in Russia does duty for the ministry 
of commerce, there is an official council of trade and manufactures 
which sits in St Petersburg, and is presided over by a representative 
of the ministry. A similar council is also in existence at Moscow. 
In addition to these there are six local bodies, called the "local 
committees of trade and manufactures, " entrusted with the care 
of commercial interests in Archangel, Odessa, Rostov-on-the-Don, 
Tver, Tikhvin and Ivanovo-Voznesensk. At Warsaw there is 
a " committee of manufactures. " The committees are purely 
consultative bodies. 

Closer to what we know as chambers of commerce are the in- 
stitutions called " exchange committees. " They are voluntary 
associations, chosen by a council elected for the purpose by the 
commercial community; they generally consist of twelve members 
elected for five years, a and the president is appointed by the minister 
of finance. Two important commercial societies, although un- 
official, are recognized and frequently consulted by the govern- 
ment, viz. the Society for the Encouragement of Russian Trade and 
Industry, of St Petersburg, and the Society for the Encouragement 
of Navigation, of Moscow. 

The Russian government is represented abroad by commercial 
attaches, who are known as " agents of the Russian ministry of 
finance. " The m duties of these attaches are almost similar to 
those of the British commercial attaches, but they are entrusted 
with the promotion of Russian financial as well as commercial 
interests. 

Japan. — Commercial matters in Japan come within the cogniz- 
ance of the minister of state for agriculture and commerce. The 
chief commercial associations are the chambers of commerce, 
which are under the direct control of the minister. They are 
official bodies, with a constitution somewhat resembling that of 
the French chambers. The members must be Japanese subjects.

sular assistance to British trade abroad. Parliamentary Papers^

TRADE UNIONS, combinations for regulating the relations 
between workmen and masters, workmen and workmen, or 
masters and masters, or for imposing restrictive conditions on 
the conduct of any industry or business. 

I. — The United Kingdom 
By the English common law such combinations were, with 
certain unimportant exceptions, regarded as illegal. They were 
considered to be contrary to public policy, and were History of 
treated as conspiracies in restraint of trade. Those British 
who were concerned in them were liable to be Legislation. 
criminally prosecuted by indictment or information, and 
to be punished on conviction by fine and imprisonment, Tbe 
offence was the same whether it was committed by masters or 
by workmen. But although the common law applied mutatis 
mutandis to both of them alike, it was, practically speaking, in 
reference rather to the latter than to the former that its effects 
were developed and ascertained. Although workmen, as indi- 
viduals, might lawfully consent or refuse to labour for any 
remuneration or for any time they pleased, the hostility of the 
common law to combinations effected the result that when two 
or more of them joined together, and agreed to labour only on 
certain stipulated terms, their agreements were not only null 
and void, but were criminal offences subject to punishment. 
It was immaterial whether the end they had in view was to deter- 
mine wages or to limit work; or whether the means they adopted 
for promoting its attainment was a simultaneous withdrawal 
from employment, an endeavour to prevent other workmen from 
resuming or taking employment, or an attempt to control the 
masters in the management of their trade, the engagement of 
journeymen or apprentices, or the use of machinery or industrial 
processes; or whether in seeking to enforce their demands they

relied merely on advice and solicitation, or resorted to reproach 
and menace, or proceeded to actual violence. In any event 
their combination in itself constituted a criminal conspiracy, and 
rendered them amenable to prosecution and punishment. 

From the reign of Edward I. to the reign of George IV. the 
operation of the common law was enforced and enlarged by 
between thirty and forty acts of parliament, all of which were 
more or less explicitly designed to prohibit and prevent the 
organization of labour. But the rise of the manufacturing 
system towards the end of the 18th century, and the revolution 
which accompanied it in the industrial arrangements of the 
country, were attended by a vast and unexpected extension of 
the movement which the legislature had for so long essayed to 
suppress. Among the multitudes of workmen who then began 
to be employed in factories, trade unions in the form of secret 
societies speedily became numerous and active, and to meet 
the situation a more summary procedure than that which had 
hitherto been available was provided by an act passed in 1800. 
Act of 1800. ^ ^is statute it was enacted that all persons 
* combining with others to advance their wages or 
decrease the quantity of their work, or in any way to affect 
or control those who carried on any manufacture or trade 
in the conduct and management thereof, might be convicted 
before one justice of the peace, and might be committed to 
the common gaol for any time not exceeding three calendar 
months, or be kept to hard labour in the house of correction for 
a term of two calendar months. 

The discontent and disorder consequent upon the introduction 
of steam and improved appliances into British manufactures 
in the first quarter of the 19th century, in conjunction with a 
state of commercial depression and national distress, led to the 
nomination of a select committee by the House of Commons, 
to inquire into the whole question of what were comprehensively 
designated the " combination laws," in the session of 1824. 
The committee reported to the House that " those laws had not 
only not been efficient to prevent combinations either of masters 
Act of 1824, or wor kmen, but on the contrary had, in the opinion 
of many of both parties, had a tendency to produce 
mutual irritation and distrust and to give a violent 
character to the combinations, and to render them highly dan- 
gerous to the peace of the community." They further reported 
that in their judgment " masters and workmen should be freed 
from such restrictions as regards the rate of wages and the hours 
of working, and be left at perfect liberty to make such agreements 
as they mutually think proper." They therefore recommended 
that " the statute laws which interfered in these particulars 
between masters and workmen should be repealed," and also 
that " the common law under which a peaceable meeting of 
masters or workmen might be prosecuted should be altered." 
In pursuance of their report, an act, 5 Geo. IV. c. 95, was at 
once brought in and passed. But the immediate results of 
the change which it effected were regarded as so inconvenient, 
formidable and alarming, that in the session of 1825 the House 
of Commons appointed another select committee to re-examine 
the various problems, and review and reconsider the evidence 
submitted to their predecessors. They reported without delay 
in favour of the total repeal of the act of 1824, and the restora- 
tion of those provisions of the combination laws, whether statu- 
tory or customary, which it had been more particularly intended 
to abrogate. The .consequence was an act passed in 1825 of 
Actoti825* wm ch the preamble declares that the act of 1824 
had not been found effectual, and that combinations 
such as it had legalized were " injurious to trade and com- 
merce, dangerous to the tranquillity of the country, and 
especially prejudicial to the interests of all who were concerned 
in them." The effect of this act was to leave the common law 
of conspiracy in full force against, all combinations in restraint 
of trade, except such as it expressly exempted from its operation, 
as it had been before the act of 1824 was passed. It comprised, 
however, within itself the whole of the statute law relating to 
the subject, and under it no persons were liable to punishment 
for.meeting together for the sole purpose of consulting upon and 



determining the rate of wages or prices which they, being 
present, would require for their work or pay to their workmen, 
or the hours for which they would work or require work in any 
trade or business, or for entering into any agreement, verbal or 
written, for the purpose of fixing the rate of wages or prices which 
the parties to it should so receive or pay. But all persons were 
subjected to a maximum punishment of three months' imprison- 
ment with hard labour who should by violence, threats or intimi- 
dation, molestation, or obstruction, do, or endeavour to do, or 
aid, abet or assist in doing or endeavouring to do, any of a 
series of things inconsistent with freedom of contract which the 
act enumerated and defined. 

In 1859, in order to remove certain doubts which had arisen 
as to the true import and meaning of the undefined words 
"molestation" and "obstruction," it was provided Mt ofl8$9 
by an amending act that " no person, by reason 
merely of his endeavouring peaceably and in a reasonable 
manner, and without threat or intimidation, direct or indirect, 
to persuade others to cease or abstain from work, in order to 
obtain the rate of wages or the altered hours of labour agreed 
to by him and others, should be deemed to have been guilty 
of ' molestation ' or ' obstruction/ " 

In spite of the partial recognition which trade unions had 
thus received, they continued to be unlawful, although not 
necessarily criminal, associations. In certain cases, 
they were by statute exempted from penal con- *M9?1876. 
sequences, and their members were empowered to 
combine for specified purposes, and to collect funds by volun- 
tary contributions for carrying them into effect. But in the 
estimation of the common law the special privileges which had 
been accorded to them under particular circumstances did 
not confer any general character of legality upon them, and 
where their rules were held to be in restraint of trade, as in 
the prohibition of piece-work or the limitation of the number 
of apprentices, they were still regarded as conspiracies. ■ In 
this condition the law was when what became notorious as the 
" Sheffield and Manchester outrages " suggested the appoint- 
ment of the royal commission on trade unions, which investi- 
gated the subject from 1867 to 1869. The outcome was, first, 
a temporary measure for the more effectual protection of 
the funds of trade unions, passed in 1869, and, secondly, the 
two measures which, as amended and amending, are cited 
together as the " Trade Union Acts 187 1 and 1876." 

Under these statutes, construed with the Conspiracy and 
Protection of Property Act 1875, the law relating to combi- 
nations, whether of workmen or of masters, 
entered upon a new phase. In connexion with Effects. 
trade disputes no person can be prosecuted for 
conspiracy to commit an act which would not be criminal if 
committed by him singly. The purposes of a trade union 
are not to be deemed illegal merely because they are in 
restraint of trade, and the circumstance that they are 
in restraint of trade is not to render any member of it liable 
to prosecution, nor is it to avoid or make voidable any agree- 
ment or trust relating to it. No court, however, can enter- 
tain legal proceedings with the object of directly enforcing 
or recovering damages for the breach of an agreement between 
the members of a trade union as such, concerning the con- 
ditions on which the members for the time being shall or 
shall not sell their goods, transact their business, employ or 
be employed, or the payment by any person of any subscrip- 
tion or penalty to a trade union, or for the application of 
the funds of a trade union to provide benefits or to furnish 
contributions to any employer or workman not a member of 
such trade union in consideration of such employer or 
workman acting in conformity with the rules or resolutions 
of such trade union, or to discharge any fine imposed upon 
any person by any court of justice or any agreement made 
between one trade union and another, or any bond to secure 
such agreement. But such incapacity to sue on such agree- 
ments is not to be taken as constituting any of them illegal. 
Every person, however, commits a misdemeanour, and on

conviction is liable to a maximum fine of £20, or to a maximum 
imprisonment of three months with hard labour, who wilfully and 
maliciously breaks a contract of service or hiring, knowing or 
having reasonable cause to believe that the probable consequence 
of his so doing, either alone or in combination with others, 
will be to endanger human life or cause serious bodily injury, 
or to expose valuable property, whether real or personal, 
to destruction or serious injury; or, who, being employed 
by a municipal authority or by any company or contractor on 
whom is imposed by act of parliament, or who have otherwise 
assumed, the duty of supplying any place with gas or water, 
wilfully and maliciously breaks a contract of service or hiring, 
knowing, or having reasonable cause to believe, that the 
probable consequence of his so doing, alone or in combination 
with others, will be to deprive the inhabitants of that place, 
wholly or in part, of their supply of gas or water; or who, 
with a view to compel any other person to do or to abstain 
from doing any act which such other person has a right to 
abstain from doing or to do, wrongfully and without legal 
authority uses violence to or intimidates such other person 
or his wife or children, or injures his property, or who per- 
sistently follows such person about from place to place, or who 
hides any tools, clothes or other property owned or used by 
such other person, or deprives him of or hinders him in the use 
thereof, or who watches or besets the house or other place where 
such person resides or works or carries on business or happens 
to be, or the approach to such house or place, or who follows 
such other person with two or more other persons in a disorderly 
manner in or through any street or road. Attending at or near 
the house or place where a person resides or works or carries 
on business, in order merely to obtain or communicate infor- 
mation was not watching or besetting within the statute, but 
this proviso has since been repealed. In regard to registration, 
trade unions are placed on a similar footing with friendly and 
provident and industrial societies, and they enjoy all the 
privileges, advantages and facilities which those associations 
possess and command, except in so far as they differ by the 
fact that there is no legally enforceable contract between a trade 
union and its members, and that the right of a registered trade 
union to invest funds with the National Debt Commissioners 
is limited, and in a few other matters. On their side, how- 
ever, they have to comply with the same conditions, are sub- 
ject to the same liabilities, and are compelled to make the same 
periodical returns. 

During the years following 1876 several important amend- 
ments of the law, other than special trade union legislation, 
and the decisions of the courts in various cases, led 
Legislation*^ *° ^ e important act of 1906. These affected 
principally the liability of trade union funds to be 
taken in execution for the wrongful acts of agents of the union, 
the statute law relating to picketing and other incidents of 
strikes, and the law of conspiracy as affecting trade unions. 

The two latter points are dealt with in the article on Strikes 
and Lock-Guts, and it may suffice here to say that the clauses 
in the act of 1875 prescribing punishment for watching and beset- 
ting a house, &c, with the view of compelling any other person in 
the manner set forth, have been amended by the repeal of the 
proviso that " Attending at or near the house or place where a 
person resides, or works, or carries on business, or happens to be, 
or the approach to such house or place, in order merely to obtain 
or communicate information, shall not be deemed a watching 
or besetting within the meaning of this section " by the enact- 
ment in the act of 1906 that : "It shall be lawful for one or 
more persons, acting on their own behalf or on behalf of 
a trade union or of an individual employer or firm in con- 
templation or furtherance of a trade dispute, to attend at 
or near a house or place where a person resides or works or 
carries on business or happens to be, if they so attend merely 
for the purpose of peacefully obtaining or communicating 
information, or of peacefully persuading any person to work 
or abstain from working." 

The object was to include the right of peaceful persuasion 



which had been supposed by parliament to be implied in the 
terms of the act of 1875. Further, the law of conspiracy 
has been amended by enactments in the act of 1906 that: " An 
act done in pursuance of an agreement or combination by two 
or more persons shall, if done in contemplation or furtherance 
of a trade dispute, not be actionable unless the act if done 
without any such agreement or combination would be action- 
able," and " An act done by a person in contemplation or 
furtherance of a trade dispute shall not be actionable on the 
ground only that it induces some other person to break a con- 
tract of employment or that it is an interference with the trade, 
business or employment of some other person, or with the 
right, of some other person to dispose of his capital or his labour 
as he wills." 

The act of 1875, m tne words of Lord Cairns, was framed on 
the principle that " the offences in relation to trade disputes 
should be thoroughly known and understood, and Leading 
that persons should not be subjected to the indirect Cases in the 
and deluding action of the old law of conspiracy," Law-courts. 
but no one during the discussion of the bill was thinking of 
the civil action. This matter became important when the 
dicta of various judges in the House of Lords in the case 
of Quinn v. Leathern showed that there might be an 
action for damages based on any conspiracy to injure 
or do harm, particularly when it is considered that the very- 
essence of a strike is in one sense injury to those against 
whom it is directed, and these opinions became of the utmost 
import to trade unions when the Tail Vale case showed that 
the fact of procuring to strike might also involve trade union 
funds in liability, even where there had been no procuring 
to break contracts. This important decision arose through 
the amendment of general procedure under the Judicature 
Acts in 188;. The distinction was abolished between legal 
and equitable rules as regards parties to sue and be sued, 
and in 1883 there was issued a General Order No. xvi. of 
the supreme court, rule 9 of which prescribed that where there 
arc numerous parties having the same interest in one cause 
or matter, one or more of such persons may sue or be sued, 
or may be authorized by a court or judge to defend in such 
cause or matter, on behalf or for the benefit of all persons 
so interested. It was decided in Temperton v. Russell in r8g3 
where three trade unions were made defendants to represent 
all the members, and the order did not apply in the case of 
a trade union, because the words of the order " numerous 
parties having the same interest in one cause or matter " could 
only be satisfied by parties who had, or claimed to have, a 
beneficial proprietary right which they were asserting or de- 
fending, from which it was inferred that they could not be sued 
at all, and in the report of the Royal Commission on Labour 
in r894 the opinion was cither assumed or expressly stated 
that they could not be sued in tort. In 1901 the House 
of Lords overruled Temperton v. Russell in the case Qf the 
Duke of Bedford v. Ellis, holding that the General Order No. 
xvi. rule 9, was universal in its application. In the same 
year the TatT Vale case came before the House of Lords. 
In the first place, expounding the Trade Union Act 1871, 
they held unanimously that from the provisions in that act 
concerning registered trade unions there is to be legally in- 
ferred an intention of parliament that a trade union might be 
sued in tort in its registered name, with the conse- 
quence that trade union funds would be liable Case< 
for any damages that might be awarded. Secondly 
— apart from the Trade Union Act — Lord Macnaghten and 
Lord Lindley expressed an unhesitating opinion that under the 
General Order No. xvi, as interpreted inDuke of Bedford v. 
Ellis, any trade union, whether registered or not, could be sued 
in tort by means of a representative action. Trade unionists 
protested against the result as a decision of judges making 
a practically new law against trade unions and nullifying 
the settlement of their status made by the legislature in 
r87r, and in June 1903 a royal commission was again ap- 
pointed to inquire into the subject of trade disputes and trade

combinations and as to the law affecting them, and to report 
on the law applicable to the same and the effect of any modifi- 
cations thereof. 

The majority of the commission reported in January 1906 
in favour of an alteration in the law relating to picketing and 
conspiracy, but against any alteration of the law 
t906. as ^ a ^ down in the Taff Vale judgment. A 

different view was, however, expressed in the Trade 
Disputes Act passed in the same year, whereby it was 
enacted with reference to trades union funds that " an action 
against a trade union, whether of workmen or masters, or 
against any members or officials thereof on behalf of them- 
selves and all other members of the trade union in respect 
of any tortious act alleged to have been committed by or 
on behalf of the trade union, shall not be entertained by 
any court, " although " nothing in this section shall affect 
the liability of the trustees of a trade union to be sued 
in the events provided for by the Trades Union Act 1871, 
section 9, except in respect of any tortious act committed 
by or on behalf of the union in contemplation or in further- 
ance of a trade dispute. " This act and the two previous 
acts are cited together as the Trade Union Acts 187 1 to 1906, 
and form the present statutory enactments upon the subject. 

In December 1909 one of the most important judgments 
in connexion with trade unions was delivered in the 
case of Osborne v. Amalgamated Society of Railway 
Jadjrment^ ^ ervan ^ s - The litigation had extended over two 
years, ending in the House of Lords (December 21, 
1909) upholding the decision of the court of appeal (L.R. 
1909, ch. 163). The plaintiff, who had been a member of the 
Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants since 1892, sued 
his trade union to have it declared that one of its current 
rules, which provided, amongst other things, for parliamentary 
representation and the enforced levy of contributions from 
him and other members of the society, towards the payment 
of salaries or maintenance allowance to members of parliament 
pledged to observe and fulfil the conditions imposed by the 
Labour Party, was ultra vires and void. It was decided in 
the King's Bench against the plaintiff, but the judgment was 
reversed by the court of appeal, whose decision was upheld 
by the House of Lords. This meant that the Labour Party 
in the House of Commons would have to find other ways and 
means than contributions from trade unionists to maintain their 
members in parliament. A voluntary levy was attempted, but 
did not meet with any success, and in 1910 agitation was set on 
foot by the Labour Party for the reversal of the " Osborne 
judgment. " They also announced in September their intention 
of making a change in the constitution of their party by elimin- 
ating the necessity of each member signing an acceptance 
of certain conditions, on the ground that the party had 
arrived at a state when it could trust to ordinary party loyalty 
to keep their members' action in accordance with the policy 
of the party. It was also hoped that it would meet many 
objections raised against their agitation for the reversal of 
the Osborne judgment. The agitation had the result of in- 
creasing the force of the movement for payment of members, 
not only in the Liberal party but also among the more pro- 
gressive Conservatives. 

Trade unions, in the sense in which the term is now under- 
stood, appear to be almost exclusively of modern growth. 
Though combinations among various classes of 
Organization, workmen to improve their position have doubt- 
* less been formed from time to time from an early 
period, such combinations, up to comparatively recent years, 
were mostly ephemeral, almost the only class among whom 
permanent associations of journeymen are known to have 
existed in the middle ages being the masons, whose con- 
federacies were prohibited by law in 1425. With this 
doubtful exception, there is little or no trace of permanent 
combinations corresponding to the modern trade union 
before the 18th century. During the period when wages and 
conditions of employment were the subject of State regulation 



(e.g. under the Statute of Apprentices of Elizabeth), combina- 
tions to exact higher rates or other conditions than those so fixed 
were naturally regarded as illegal conspiracies. 

The craft gilds of the middle ages have sometimes been 
regarded as the true predecessors of trade unions, but the 
analogy must not be pressed too far. The structure, con- 
stitution and functions of a gild of craftsmen, aiming at the 
protection and regulation of the craft as a whole, were essen- 
tially different from those of a trade union, formed to protect 
one class of persons engaged in an industry against another. 
Nor is there any trace of direct continuity between gilds 
and trade unions, for the claim of certain Irish trade unions 
to be descended from gilds will not* bear scrutiny (see Webb, 
History of Trade Unionism, appendix). The only true sense 
in which it can be said that there is a certain indirect 
historical filiation between gilds and trade unions is that, as 
pointed out by Brentano, some of the earliest trade unions had 
for their original object the enforcement of the decaying 
Elizabethan legislation, which in its turn had taken the 
place of the obsolete regulation of industry by the craft gilds, 
so that among the rules and objects of such unions would 
naturally be some bearing a likeness to gild regulations. 

The actual way in which trade unions first came into being 
probably varied very greatly. In some cases, as stated above, 
their origin can be definitely traced to associations for en- 
forcing the legal regulation of industry against the opposition 
of employers; in others, the meetings of journeymen belonging 
to the same trade for such purposes as sick or burial clubs 
became naturally the nucleus of secret combinations to raise 
wages. The growth of the " capitalistic " system of industry, 
under which the workman no longer owned the materials or 
instruments with which he worked, was one of the most potent 
causes of the development of workmen's combinations. The 
efforts of trade unions to revive the enforcement of the Eliza- 
bethan* legislation not only failed, but led to its repeal (1813- 
1814); but the laws against combinations, which had been made 
more stringent and more general by the acts of 1 799-1 800, 
remained unaltered until 1824. In spite of these acts, which 
made all combinations illegal, there is evidence that trade 
clubs of journeymen existed and were tolerated in many 
trades and districts during the first quarter of the 1 9th 
century, though they were always subject to the fear of 
prosecution if they took hostile action against employers; 
and in many cases strikes were suppressed by the conviction 
of their leaders under these acts or under the common law 
of conspiracy. The partial protection accorded to societies 
for the purpose of regulating wages and hours of labour by 
the law of 1825 led to a rapid multiplication and expansion 
of trade unions, and to an outburst of strikes, in which, 
however, partly owing to the widespread commercial depres- 
sion, the workmen were mostly unsuccessful. Thus the first 
impetus given to trade unions by the modification of the 
combination laws was followed by a collapse, which in its 
turn was followed (in the third decade of the century) by 
a succession of attempts on the part of workmen to establish 
a federal or universal combination, to embrace members not 
of one but of several trades. To this new form of combination, 
which excited a good deal of alarm among employers, the term 
" trades union, " as distinct from trade union, was applied. 
All these general movements, however, proved short-lived, 
and the most extensive of them, the " Grand National Con- 
solidated Trades Union," which was formed in 1834 and 
claimed half a million adherents, only had an active existence 
for a few months, its break-up being hastened by the con- 
viction and transportation of six Dorchester labourers for the 
administration of unlawful oaths. In the years of depressed 
trade which followed, trade unionism* once more declined, 
and the interest of workmen was largely diverted from trade 
combinations to more general political movements, e.g. Chartism, 
the Anti-Corn-Law agitation and Robert Owen's schemes of 
co-operation. 

From 1845 we trace another revival of trade unions, the

[UNITED KINGDOM 



characteristic tendency of this period being the amalgamation 
of local trade clubs to form societies, national in scope, but 
confined to single or kindred trades. High rates of contri- 
bution, and the provision of friendly as well as trade benefits, 
were among the features of the new type of union, of which 
tbe Amalgamated Society of Engineers, formed in 1851, was 
the most important example. The growth of unions of the new 
type was followed by a development of employers' associations 
in the 'sixties, and by a number of widespread strikes and 
lock-outs, and also by various efforts to promote arbitration 
and conciliation by the establishment of joint boards of 
employers and employed. (See Arbitration and Conciliation 
and Strikes and Lock-outs.) 

A series of outrages at Sheffield and Manchester in 1865- 
1866, in which officials of some local trade societies were impli- 
cated, led to the appointment in 1867 of a Royal Commission on 
Trade Unions, whose report was followed by the passage of the 
Trade Union Act of 1871, which as amended in 1876 and 1906 
now governs the legal position of trade unions. Conferences 
of trade union representatives held in 1866 and 1867 to deter- 
mine their policy with respect to the royal commission of in- 
quiry, led to the gatherings of the trade union congress which 
are still held annually. 

The period of inflated trade which began in 1871 caused, 
as usual, another rapid growth of trade combinations, of which 
the most characteristic feature was their extension to agricultural 
and general labourers. To meet this new development of com- 
bination, the National Federation of Associated Employers 
of Labour was formed in 1873. The years of depression, 1875- 
1880, were marked by a series of unsuccessful strikes against 
reductions of wages, and by a general decline of trade unions, 
which did not again revive until nearly ten years later, when 
the new wave of prosperous trade brought with it an outburst 
of strikes, chiefly among unskilled labourers, for improved 
conditions, of which the most notable was the strike* of the 
London dock labourers in 1889. These trade movements 
were accompanied by the formation of a large number of 
unions of a type more akin to those of 1830-1834 than to the 
more modern trade-friendly society with its high contributions 
and benefits. The " new unions " were chiefly among unskilled 
labourers; their rates of contributions were from id. to 3d. a 
week, and as a rule they only offered strike benefit. Another 
characteristic was the extent to which their leaders were per- 
meated with the Socialistic doctrines which had then recently 
taken root in Great Britain, and which led them to advocate 
positive state interference with industry in the interests of 
the labourers (e.g. the legal limitation of hours of labour). 

The reports of the Royal Commission on Labour, which 
sat from 1891 to 1894, contain much valuable information 
on the state of facts and on the opinions of employers and 
workmen at this period. 

From 1892 onwards the progress of trade unionism can be 
traced statistically. The depression of trade, 1892-1895, brought 
with it, as usual, some decline in trade unionism; but though 
many of the " new unions" collapsed, some of the more im- 
portant have survived to the present time. The revival of 
trade which began in 1896 was naturally accompanied by an 
increase in the strength of trade unions; but the most 
marked characteristic of this period was the extension and 
consolidation of employers' associations, of which perhaps 
the most notable is the Engineering Employers' Federation, 
which was originally formed on the Clyde, but gradually 
extended to other districts and became a national organiza- 
tion of great strength during its successful struggle with 
the Amalgamated Society of Engineers in 1897-1898. Among 
the other more important employers' associations and 
federations of a national character may be mentioned the Ship- 
ping Federation, the Federated Coal Owners, the Ship-building 
Federation, the Federation of Master Cotton-Spinners' 
Associations, the National Federation of Building Trade Em- 
ployers, and the Incorporated Federated Associations of Boot 
and Shoe Manufacturers. 



In 1899 a general federation of trade unions was established 
which had in 1907 a membership of 650,000 in 117 affiliated 
societies. This federation links the trade unions of the United 
Kingdom with those of other countries by its affiliation 
with the international federation of trade unions, which em- 
braces the national federations of the principal European 
countries. During recent years there has been a noticeable 
tendency towards the creation of federations of trade unions, 
and the absorption of the smaller by the larger societies. Trade 
unions, both in their historical development and their present 
organization, present a very great variety of constitutions. 
The oldest type is that of the local trade club, con- 
sisting of a comparatively small number of men c ^ astHa - 
following the same occupation in the same locality. 
A large number of unions have never progressed beyond this 
primitive form of organization. The government is of the 
simplest kind, by a general assembly of all the members, while 
such officers as are required to carry on the necessary routine 
business of the society are chosen by rotation or even by lot. 

Indisposition to concentrate power in the hands of per- 
manent officers and a tendency to divide the business of manage- 
ment equally among all the members, instead of delegating 
authority to a few chosen representatives, are leading character- 
istics of trade unions in this primitive form. The organization 
here described, even if adequate for ordinary current require- 
ments, is ill suited for conducting a contest with employers, 
and accordingly in times of strife an improvised " strike com- 
mittee " often comes into existence and practically governs 
the conduct of the dispute. No doubt this double constitution 
of the old trade club as a loosely organized friendly society, 
converting itself at times into a more or less secret strike 
combination ruled by an irresponsible committee, is to be traced 
to the time when trade unions as such were illegal com- 
binations and had to carry out their objects under the guise of 
friendly societies. The Friendly Society of Ironfounders 
(established in 1809), though it has to a great extent out- 
grown its primitive constitution, retains in its name the mark 
of its origin, while the government of the London Society 
of Bookbinders, by mass meeting of its members, offers an 
example of the persistence of traditional methods under wholly 
changed conditions. The Sheffield trade clubs, responsible 
for the outrages which led to the appointment of the Trade 
Union Commission in 1867, and subsequently to the passage 
of the Trade Union Acts, conformed as a rule to the primitive 
type. At the present time over 750 trade unions are known 
to exist which are purely local in character, with no branches. 
The next step in trade union evolution seems to have generally 
been an alliance or federation of two or more local clubs be- 
longing to the same trade. This federation would make it 
necessary to provide some machinery for common management, 
the simplest and crudest expedient being for each of the allied 
clubs to act in rotation as the governing branch. Thus the 
government of the federation or " amalgamated society " was 
at any given time confided to the members of a single locality, 
and the seat of government was periodically shifted. Some 
federal societies (e.g. the Mutual Association of Journeymen 
Coopers) still retain this primitive form of government. 

As the tendency developed for local clubs to unite, the necessity 
of permanent officials to cope with the growing business of the 
amalgamation caused the institution of a paid secretary (usually 
elected by the whole body of members), and this led naturally 
to the fixing of the seat of administration at a particular centre 
instead of rotating among the branches. Some continuity of 
policy and of office tradition was thus made possible, but the 
executive committee almost invariably continued to consist of 
the local committee of the district where the seat of government 
happened to be. Thus up to 1892 the business of the Amalga- 
mated Society of Engineers, a society with hundreds of branches 
all over the United Kingdom and even abroad, was conducted by 
a committee elected by the London branches. The Boilermakers 
continued a somewhat similar form of government up to. 1895; 
and many great societies, e.g. the Amalgamated Society of 



UNITED KINGDOM] 



TRADE UNIONS 



145 



Carpenters and Joiners, continue a somewhat similar system to 
the present day. 

The plan of entrusting the government of a national society 
to a local executive has obvious conveniences, where the society 
consists of a body of working men scattered over a large area and 
with no leisure for travelling. But the control exercised by a 
locally-elected committee over a general secretary deriving his 
authority not from them but from the vote of a much wider 
constituency, could hardly be expected to be very effective; 
while the expedients of referring all important questions to a vote 
of the whole body of members, and of summoning at periodical 
intervals special delegate meetings to revise the rules, have 
proved in practice but clumsy substitutes for the permanent 
control and direction of the executive officers by a representative 
council. Quite as ineffective in some cases has been the authority 
of a mere local executive over the committees of other districts. 
Accordingly, some of the largest " amalgamated " unions have 
now adopted a representative system of government. Thus in 
1892 the Engineers revised their rules so as to provide for the 
election of the executive council by vote of all the members divided 
into eight equal electoral districts. The members of council so 
elected are permanent paid officials, devoting all their time to 
the work of the society. The general secretary, however, con- 
tinues to be chosen by the whole body of members, while the 
responsibility of the council is also weakened by the institution 
of " district delegates " nominally responsible to them, but 
chosen by direct election in the various districts. (This division 
of authority and consequent weakness of responsibility was one 
of the causes of the state of things which led to the great engineer- 
ing dispute of 1897, and it also led to a deadlock in negotiations 
on the north-east coast in 1908, the executive being powerless to 
enforce its views.) The Boilermakers adopted the system of a 
permanent executive in 1895. 

In the case of certain highly-localized industries, such as 
cotton and coal, the conditions have admitted of a somewhat 
different form of constitution from that described above. Thus 
the Amalgamated Association of Operative Cotton-Spinners is a 
federal organization, consisting of a number of local associations, 
all, however, situated within a comparatively small area. The 
governing bodies of the association are — (1) a quarterly meeting 
of about a hundred representatives of the districts; (2) an 
executive committee of thirteen chosen by the above represen- 
tative meeting, of whom seven must be working spinners and the 
other six are usually permanent district officials; (3) a sub- 
council to transact the ordinary daily work of the association, 
consisting of the six official members referred to above. The 
secretary is chosen by the representative meeting, and engages 
his own office assistants. Here we have the familiar features of 
representative institutions — a large legislative body, a small 
executive chosen by and responsible to this body, and a still 
smaller group of permanent officials to transact ordinary business. 

Lastly, there are some large societies constituted not by the 
aggregation of local clubs or the federation of neighbouring 
associations, but originally founded as " national societies " 
divided into districts and branches for administrative conveni- 
ence. An example is the Amalgamated Society of Railway 
Servants, founded in 1872. 

Besides the tendency of the national society with branches to 
swallow up the local trade club, there is a further tendency among 
the larger societies to form federations for certain common pur- 
poses. Such federations are to be distinguished from national 
trade unions, inasmuch as their members are societies and not 
individuals, and as a rule their powers over their constituent 
organizations are limited to certain specific objects. On the other 
hand, they are more than merely consultative bodies (such as 
local trades councils). 

Some federations consist of unions in the same industry in 
different districts (e.g. the Miners' Federation). " Single trade " 
federations like this have usually considerable powers, including 
that of imposing levies. 

In the cotton-spinning trade, the trade union organization 
has a federal character, and the Amalgamated Association of 



Operative Cotton-Spinners, in spite of its name, is, strictly 
speaking, a federation. 

Other federations (e.g. in the building trade) are formed of 
allied trades in the same locality, and usually have little executive 
power. The Federation of Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades 
has among its objects the settlement of disputes between members 
of its constituent societies as to the limits of their work. Some 
federations aim at embracing societies in all kinds of industries, 
but as a rule such organizations have not proved long-lived. 
The most recent example is the " General Federation of Trade 
Unions," formed in 1899, referred to above. 

Since 1866 a Congress of delegates from trade unions has met 
annually for discussion, and a parliamentary committee elected 
by this congress watches over matters in which trade unions are 
interested during the ensuing year. 

The principal object of every trade union is to protect the 

trade interests of its members, and to strengthen their position 

in bargaining with their employers with regard to the 

conditions under which they work. The chief means °J? ! J??Jt nd 
, 1-11 1 . » / Methods. 

by which they seek to attam these objects (apart 

from political methods such as the promotion of legislation or of 
administrative action by public authorities) are twofold: viz. 
the support of members when engaged in a collective dispute with 
employers by the payment of " dispute " benefit, and the insur- 
ance of members against loss from want of work by the payment 
of "unemployed" benefit, so as to enable them to refuse any 
terms of employment inferior to those recognized by the trade 
union. All trade unions in one form or another provide " dis- 
pute " benefit, but a separate " unemployed " benefit is by no 
means universal, though, except in certain groups of trades, it is 
usual among more powerful and well established societies. Thus 
in the mining, clothing, and even many branches of the building 
trade, comparatively little is spent by trade unions on " un- 
employed " benefit, while, on the other hand, in the metal, 
engineering, shipbuilding, printing and other trades a large 
proportion of the total expenditure is devoted to this object 
(see Statistics below). In some important societies, such as 
the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, " unemployed " and 
" dispute " benefits are mixed up together, members engaged 
in a dispute receiving an addition of 5s. per week (known as 
" contingent " benefit) to the ordinary out-of-work pay (known 
as " donation "). 

Unemployed benefit may, of course, be regarded as a " friendly " 
benefit, i.e. a provision against one class of the casualties to 
which a workman is exposed — the loss of employment through 
slackness of trade. But in practice it also operates as a method 
of maintaining the " standard " rate of wages, members being 
entitled to it who could obtain employment, but only on con- 
ditions disapproved by the society or branch. 

The conditions under which the members of a union are 
entitled to financial support in a strike vary in different societies, 
and are prescribed in the rules. Usually, though the initiative 
may come from the localities, the central executive must approve 
of the strike before it takes place, and may at any time declare it 
to be closed, though in some societies the central authority is 
often unwilling to take the responsibility of curbing its members 
by exercising its powers in this respect. 

" Dispute " and " unemployed " benefits are the only ones 
which are specially characteristic of trade unions, and as regards 
the latter benefit, it may be said that trade unions have hitherto 
been the only form of organization capable of meeting the 
difficulties arising from " malingering." Most of the more 
firmly established unions, however, add to their trade functions 
those of friendly societies, providing sick, accident, superannua- 
tion, and funeral benefits, or some of these. The position of a 
trade union, however, with regard to these benefits differs very 
materially from that of a friendly society. The trade union is 
under no legally enforceable contract with its members to provide 
the stipulated benefits: it can change their scale, or even abolish 
them, by vote of its members, and a member who has contributed 
for years in hope of receiving them has no legal redress. Again, 
a member excluded from the society for some " trade " reason 



146 



TRADE UNIONS

incidentally loses all claim to friendly benefits. The funds of a 
trade union applicable to trade and friendly purposes are never 
kept distinct (in the few cases in which some distinction is 
attempted, the society may " borrow " from the one fund in 
aid of the other in case of emergency) ; and a prolonged strike 
or depression of trade may so deplete the funds as to make 
it impossible for the society to meet its engagements as 
regards sickness or superannuation. Thus the friendly society 
operations of trade unions have strictly no actuarial basis, and 
in some cases the scale of contribution and benefit have been 
fixed with little regard to ultimate solvency. x 

On the other hand, the power of levying and varying the scale 
of contributions adds to some extent to the financial stability 
of the funds, and the provision of " friendly " as well as " trade " 
benefits by a trade union undoubtedly gives strength and 
continuity to the society, and increases its power of discipline 
over its members. Societies that only provide " dispute " pay 
are exposed to violent oscillations of membership, and also to a 
dangerous temptation to rush into an ill-considered strike owing 
to the mere accumulation of funds which can be used for no 
other purpose. 

The statistics of trade union expenditure on benefits of various 
classes are given below.. Of the 100 principal unions, all provide 
dispute benefit; 79 in the year 1905 provided unemployed benefit 
(including in some cases travelling pay); 79, sick or accident 
benefit; 37, superannuation benefit; and 87, funeral benefit; 
32 unions providing all four classes of benefit. 

One of the most important functions of trade unions in many 
industries is the negotiation of agreements with employers and 
employers' associations for the regulation of the conditions of 
employment in those industries. While undoubtedly the power 
of withdrawing its members from employment in the last resort 
adds to the power of a trade union in such negotiations, many of 
the most important agreements by which the conditions of labour 
of large bodies of workmen are governed are habitually con- 
cluded, and from time to time revised, by conferences of repre- 
sentatives of the trade union and employers without any strike 
taking place. To the functions of trade unions as fighting 
organizations and as friendly benefit societies should therefore 
be added that of providing the necessary machinery and basis 
for the conclusion of industrial agreements between bodies of 
workpeople and their employers (see Arbitration and Concilia- 
tion, and Strikes and Lock-outs). 

While the broad objects of trade union policy are generally 
similar, their methods and features vary greatly in detail. 
Among the objects most frequently met with (besides those of 
raising wages and shortening hours, which may be said to be 
universal) are the enforcement of a "minimum" wage; the 
limitation of overtime; the restriction of numbers in the trade 
through the limitation of apprentices, or the regulation of the 
age of entrance; the restriction or regulation of piecework (in 
trades accustomed to " time " work) ; the preservation for 
members of the trade of the exclusive right to perform certain 
classes of work claimed by other trades (leading to so-called 
" demarcation " disputes) ; resistance to the encroachment of 
labourers on work considered to be " skilled " (leading to disputes 
as to the class of persons to be employed on machines, &c); and 
the securing of a monopoly of employment for members of the 
union by a refusal to work with non-unionists.

The statistics of trade unions are very complete for recent years, 
but for earlier years the records are so fragmentary that it is im- 
possible to give exact figures showing the total growth statistics 
of trade unions over a long period. The table at 
foot of preceding column, based on the statistics published by the 
board of trade, shows the number and membership of all trade unions 
in the United Kingdom making continuous returns for each of the 
ten years 1897 to 1906. 

The fluctuations in membership correspond in the main to the 
oscillations of trade, membership declining in the years of depression 
and increasing with the revival of trade. The decline in the number 
of separate unions is chiefly due to the growing tendency to amalga- 
mate into large societies.

the various groups of trades in 1905: —

This table shows that the strength of trade unionism lies in the 
five first-named groups of trades — mining; metal engineering and 
shipbuilding; textile; building; and railway, dock and other trans- 
port — which among them account for over three-quarters of the 
total membership. 

In agriculture, trade unionism is at present practically non- 
existent, but in 1875 there were important unions of agricultural 
labourers, though at no time did they include any considerable 
proportion of the total agricultural population. 

Taking the men belonging to all trade unions together, we find 
that their number does not amount to more than about one in five 
of the adult men who belong to the classes from which trade unionists 
are drawn. . Only in a few groups do trade unionists form a high 
percentage of the total working population, e.g. coal-mining and 
cotton manufacture. The number of women belonging to trade 
unions at the end of 1906 was 162,453, distributed among 156 unions, 
of which, however, only 28 consisted exclusively of women. The 
great bulk of women trade unionists are found in the cotton trade, 
in which they actually outnumber the male members. Of all the 
women employed in factories and workshops, about one in twelve 
belongs to a trade union. 

The available statistics with regard to the financial resources of 
trade unions, and their expenditure on various objects, are not so 
complete as those of membership, as the board of trade figures 
only relate to 100 of the principal unions. As, however, these 
unions include nearly two-thirds of the total membership, the 
figures showing their financial position may be accepted as being 
representative of the whole number of societies. In 1906 the 
income of these 100 societies was £2,344,157 or 36s. 9Jd. per head; 
and their expenditure £1,958,676 or 30s. gd. per head; and at the 
end of the year the funds in hand amounted to £5,198, 53 6 or 81s. 7id. 
per head. 

The actual rates of contribution per member vary greatly among 
the unions — from 7s. up to £4 per annum. Generally speaking, 
the highest income per member is found among the unions in the 
metal, engineering and shipbuilding group, where in 1905 it averaged 
£3» 5s. 7*d., while the average in the mining unions was only 
£1, 4s. lid., and among dock labourers still lower. The metal trades 
and the textile unions appear to hold the highest amount of funds 
compared with their membership, the amounts at the end of 1905 
being £6, 3s. 8Jd. and £6, os. 3d. per head respectively in these groups, 
while in the building trade unions it was only 18s. 8jd. and in some 
societies of unskilled labourers far less than this. 

The main items of expenditure of trade unions are "dispute" 
benefit, " unemployed " benefit, various friendly benefits (including 
sick and accident, superannuation and funeral), and working ex- 
penses. The proportions of expenditure on these various objects 
naturally vary greatly in different groups of unions, and also in 
different years, some of the items being affected largely by the 
general state of employment, and the occurrence or absence of im- 
portant disputes. On the basis, however, of an average of the ten 
years 1897-1906, the following analysis of the proportionate expendi- 
ture of the 100 principal unions on various classes of objects has 
been made: on disputes, 13-4%; on unemployed 22-1 %; on friendly

benefits (other than " unemployed ") r 42*5%; on working expenses 
22%. The 42*5% of expenditure on friendly benefits is made up 
of 19*1 % on sick and accident, 12*4% on superannuation and 11 % 
on funeral and other benefits. 

The mining unions devoted 28-6% of their expenditure to the 
support of disputes (friendly benefits in this industry being largely 

Crovided by other agencies), while the unions in the printing and 
ookbinding trades only used 3*9% for this object, over three- 
quarters of their expenditure going to unemployed or friendly 
benefits. As illustrations of the variation in the expenditure by 
the same group of unions on a particular object from year to year, 
it may be stated that within the ten years' period referred to the 
annual expenditure of the metal, engineenng and shipbuilding 
group on disputes varied from £514,637 in 1897, the year of the 
great engineering dispute, to £13,266 in 1899. Again, the expenditure 
of the same group of unions on unemployed benefit varied from 
£80,512 in 1899 to £303,749 in 1904. The burden of superannuation 
payments by the 100 unions has steadily increased during the ten 
years from £137,813 in 1896 to £306,089 in 1906. 

At the end of 1906 there were 89 federations, including societies 
with a^ gross membership of over a million and three-quarters, but 
a considerable deduction must be made from this total on account 
of duplication. In the same year 231 ** trades councils" were 
known to exist, with an affiliated membership of over 895,000. 

The number of employers' associations and federations known 
to exist in the United Kingdom in 1906 was 953, including 60 
federations and national associations. Of the total number of 
associations 398 are in the building trades. 

II. — Foreign and Colonial 

Modern trade unionism has had its chief development in Eng- 
lish-speaking countries, and especially in the United Kingdom, 
where the conditions necessary for its growth have been present 
to the fullest extent. With some exceptions, such unions as 
are found elsewhere are either derived or copied from English 
organizations, or are associations with political objects. It is 
therefore unnecessary to give more than a brief summary of the 
position of trade unions in some of the principal countries and 
colonies outside the United Kingdom (for United States see IV. 
below). 

Germany. — In Germany the majority of trade unions are of a 
political character, being closely connected with the Social 
Democratic party. These Socialist trade unions, termed 
" Gewerkschaften, " were started by a congress held at Berlin in 
1 868, under the auspices of Fritscher and Schweitzer, two fol- 
lowers of Lassalle. In 1878 many of them were dissolved under 
the law prohibiting socialistic organizations, but shortly after 
their place was taken by local unions termed "Fachvercine," 
which ostensibly abstained from politics, but which in various 
ways succeeded in evading the law and carrying on the work 
of the Gewerkschaften. In 1887 a general committee of the 
German Gewerkschaften was formed, and in 1890 the General 
Commission of Trade Unions in Germany was established. Later 
years of prosperous trade have been marked by a rapid growth 
in the strength of trade unions in Germany. 

The Social Democratic (Gewerkschaften) trade unions included 
in 1907 a membership of 1,886,147 as compared with 743,296 in 
1902 and 419,162 in 1897. Of the total number of members in 
1907, 1,865,506 belonged to branches affiliated to central federations; 
the membership of ^ non-federated local unions being returned as 
only 20,641. The income of the federated trade unions in 1907 
was £2,569,839, or over 27s. per member as compared with £554,887 
(or about 15s. per member) in 1902 and £204,185 (or about 10s. 
per member) in 1897, and the expenditure in the same years to 
£2,156,126, £500,276 and £177,140 respectively. Of the 61 federa- 
tions in existence in IQ07, 43 paid travelling benefit, 42 paid unem- 
ployed benefit, 47 paid sick benefit and 57 paid funeral, removal 
and special allowance. 

Another group of trade unions in Germany, less important as 
regards number and membership than the above, are the " Gewerk- 
vereine," or non-political trade unions, sometimes known as " Hirsch- 
Duncker " unions, from the names of their founders. These unions 
were first formed in 1868, immediately after the Berlin congress 
referred to above. They were directly modelled on British trade 
unions. Since 1876 Social Democrats have been excluded. In 
their earlier years these unions suffered in membership from a series 
of unsuccessful strikes, and of late years they have been mostly 
benefit societies. In 1907 the Gewerkvereine embraced 108,889 
members. Their income amounted to £77,068 in 1907 and their 
expenditure to £71,717.^ 

Another group of unions, the Christian trade unions (Christliche 
Gewerkvereine), was formed in 1894. In 1907 the membership 
of this group was 354,760. The income of these unions 



in 1907 was £225,821, and the expenditure £167,867. Besides 
these groups of unions there were a number of independent societies 
with a membership of 96,684 in 1907. 

It will be seen that German trade unions of one type or another 
included a membership of nearly two and a half millions in 1907, 
their membership having more than doubled in the last five years. 

France. — In France combinations of workmen as well as of 
employers were prohibited by the laws of the 14th of June and the 
28th of September 1792, which overthrew the old gild or corpora- 
tion system. They were also penalized under various articles 
of the Penal Code, and it was not till 1864 that the prohibition 
was modified by law. At present the status of trade unions in 
France is regulated by the law of 1884, which repealed that of 
1791 and modified the articles of the Penal Code so far as regards 
professional syndicates of employers or workmen. Since then 
there has been a considerable growth of workmen's unions, which 
in 1906 numbered 5322 with a membership of 896,012. Of the 
unions in existence in 1906, 3675 with a membership of 752,362 
belonged to 187 federations. There is, however, some dupli- 
cation owing to the fact that some unions belong to more than 
one federation. In 1906 there were 260,869 members of unions in 
the transport, warehousing, &c, groups of trades, 103,835 in the 
metal, 73,126 in the mining and quarrying, 78,854 in the textile, 
66,678 in the building, 51,407 in the agricultural, forestry, fishing 
and cattle breeding, 48,353 in the food preparation trades and 
the remainder in various other trades. 

Austria. — Apart from the Austrian gilds, membership of which 
is compulsory for persons engaged in non-factory handicrafts and 
trades (under a law of 1883) and in mining (under a law of 1896), 
there are a certain number of trade unions in Austria, though 
freedom of combined action among workmen is less complete 
than in many other European countries. Such right of combina- 
tion as exists rests on the law of 1870, which removed the restric- 
tions imposed by the Penal Code on combinations for influencing 
the conditions of labour. The impulse given to the formation 
of unions by this law, and by the advantages gained for the work- 
men during the years of prosperous trade that immediately 
followed, received a severe check during the succeeding depres- 
sion of trade, when these advantages were mostly lost. Trade 
unionism did not revive until 1888, from which time the unions 
formed have mostly been on a Social Democratic basis, the 
majority being affiliated to a central organization in Vienna. 

Since 1901 statistics relating to the trade unions of Austria have 
been published annually by the Central Trade Union Commission 
(Gewerkschafts-Kommission) at Vienna. In 1907 there were 5156 
trade unions in particular trades, with a membership of 501,094, 
affiliated to the Social Democratic trade unions (Gewerkschaften). 
Of the total number of unions, 49 were central unions, 77 were district 
unions and 5030 were local unions. Of the total number of members 
454,693 were males and 46,401 were females. The greatest member- 
ship, 8^,085 in 1907, is shown to have been in the metal engineering 
and shipbuilding group of industries, the building trades coming 
next with 68,543 members. The transport trades showed a member- 
ship of 61,744, and the textile trades, 51,632. The chemical, glass 
and pottery trades included 54,469 members and the wood-working 
and furnishing group included 36,502 members. Food and tobacco 
trades accounted for 32,679, and mining and quarrying for 30,715 
members. 

The total receipts of the trade unions in 1907 amounted to £338,365 
and the total expenditure to £297,822, excluding receipts and ex- 
penditure for disputes. The expenditure on account of disputes, 
for which £136,822 was collected by special free organizations of 
the branch unions, amounted to £76,066 in 1907. 

There are besides these unions a number of general unions not 
confined to one trade, and trade-clubs — educational associations 
discharging to a greater or less extent trade union functions. These 
associations have, however, been excluded from the statistics 
published by the Gewerkschafts Kommission as not being trade 
unions proper. 

Hungary. — The trade union movement in Hungary is of very 
recent growth. The membership of unions affiliated to the Central 
Federation at the end of 1907 is given in the Volkwirtschaftliche 
Mitteilungen aus Ungarn as 130,192, compared with 129,332 at the 
end of 1906. Independent local unions had a membership of 11,838 
at the end of 1907. The largest groups of organized workers are in 
the building trade (35,630), metalworkers (27,732), railway employees 
(17,192) and wood-workers (14,665). 

Italy. — The Bolletina of the bureau of < labour for August 1908 
states that the membership of trade unions at the beginning of 
1908 numbered 191,599 (in 2550 local unions). Included in the

membership of 1908 are 48,877 building trades workers, 40,000 
railway employes and 17,110 metal-trade workers. The agricul- 
tural labourers' trade unions were stated to have a membership of 
425,983 at the beginning of 1908 as compared with 273,698 at the 
beginning of 1907. 

Denmark. — In 1907 there were 99,052 members of 1249 trade 
unions in Denmark, and of these 78,081 were in unions affiliated 
to the National Federation. The largest unions in the Federation 
are those of the general labourers with 22,660 members; black- 
smiths and machinists with 8000 members; masons, 5300 members; 
railway employes, 4990 members; carpenters, 3855 members; textile 
workers, 3700 members; and cabinet-makers, 3590 members. 

Sweden. — In Sweden there were, in 1906, 126,272 members of 
1596 trade unions, and of these 30,645 were factory workers (trades 
not specified), 24,485 were in unions connected with the metal 
trades, 10,706 were in the transport trades, 17,862 were in the wood- 
working trades, 7132 were in the food, &c, trades, 6602 were in the 
building trades, and 6005 were in the clothing trades. 

Norway. — The trade union movement in Norway dates practically 
from 1884. At the end of 1906 there were 25,339 members of trade 
unions, as compared withi6,o87 at the end 011905. Of the member- 
ship in 1905, 5277 were iron and metal workers, 4910 journeymen 
(factory workers), and 11 17 printers. 

Holland. — In 1893 a National Labour Secretariat was formed, 
to which, in 1899, 45 societies with 13,050 members were said to be 
affiliated. After a general strike in April 1903 the membership 
of trade unions in Holland decreased considerably, the Secretariat 
losing half its members and several trade unions dissolving. In 
1906 it was stated in the International Report of the Trade Union 
Movement that a new national centre^ of unions had been formed 
with trade unions affiliated to it, having a membership of 26,227, 
while the old centre still continued with a membership of 5000. 
The Diamond Workers' Federation, with a membership of over 
8000, was affiliated with the new national centre. 

The total number of members of trade^ unions at the end of 1906 
is given as 128,845, 33. 12 5 °f these belonging to Christian organiza- 
tions, while 95,720 belonged to other organizations. 

Belgium. — The status of trade unions in Belgium is regulated by 
the law of 1898, under which they can be incorporated, provided 
that their objects are non-political and are confined to the further- 
ance of the interests of particular trades. Belgian tra4e unions, 
nevertheless, are mostly political in character, the majority being 
connected either with the Socialist-Labour, Catholic or Liberal 
parties. The membership of the Socialist-Labour group of unions 
in 1905 was 94,151, of the Catholic unions 17,814, of the free trade 
unions 34,833 and of the Liberal unions 1685, making a grand total 
of 148,483. 

Of the 94,000 members of the Socialist-Labour unions, 60,000 
are employed in mining, 11,500 in the textile industry and 7S00 
in the metal industry. Of the 17,800 in the Catholic trade unions, 
5300 are in the textile trades, and 3200 in the buildingtrades. Of 
the 35,000 in the free trade unions, 1 1 ,000 are in the textile industry, 
6000 in the glass industry, 3600 in the applied art trades and 3300 
in the printing and bookbinding trades. 

Several organizations, e.g. the diamond workers, the printers' 
federation of Brussels, &c, are affiliated with the trade union com- 
mittee without, however, joining the political organization. The 
Catholic and Liberal associations also do not affiliate with the other 
organizations. 

British Dominions and Colonies. — Trade unionism has only 
developed to any considerable extent in a few of the industrial 
centres of the self-governing dominions. A great number of the 
unions in Canada are branches of organizations having their head- 
quarters in the United States or in England. In July 1907 the 
Canadian Labour Gazelle stated that of the 1593 local trade 
unions known to be in existence, 1346 were affiliated with central 
organizations of an international character. Besides these 1593 
local trade unions, there were 8 congresses and national associa- 
tions of labour, 49 trade and labour councils and 31 federations 
of trade unions known to be in existence. 

Between 1876 and 1890 all the principal Australian states 
passed statutes more or less resembling the Trade Union Acts of 
the United Kingdom. A similar law was passed in New Zealand 
in 1878, but in this dominion and in some of the Australian states 
trade unions can now become incorporated and acquire a special 
legal status by registration as industrial unions under the laws 
relating to industrial conciliation and arbitration. In New 
Zealand there were, in 1906, 261 unions of workers with a member- 
ship of 29,869 and 133 unions of employers with a membership 
of 3276. In the years immediately preceding 1890 certain 
Australian unions, especially among the shearers and the seamen 
and wharf labourers, acquired great strength, and their determined 
attempts to secure a monopoly of employment for members of 



their organizations led to prolonged labour disputes in 1890 and 
1891 (see Strikes and Lock-Outs), which resulted in the defeat 
of the unions and a consequent diminution of their membership 
and influence. More recently the unions have revived. They 
are encouraged by the laws relating to arbitration and concilia- 
tion, which (inter alia) permit preference for employment to be 
awarded to members of trade unions in certain circumstances. 

Authorities. — For statistics of recent progress of trade unions, 
sec reports on trade unions published by the board of trade (from 
1887 onwards). Much information respecting trade unions is 
contained in the reports of the royal commission on trade unions 
(1867) and of the royal commission on labour (1891-1894). See 
also report of royal commission on trade disputes and trade 
combinations (1903-1906). The reports of the chief registrar of 
friendly societies give information with regard to trade unions 
registered under theTrade Union Acts. On the history and con- 
stitution of trade unions the fullest information is given in Webb's 
History of Trade Unionism and Industrial Democracy , both of which 
contain valuable bibliographical appendices which may be consulted 
as regards other sources of information respecting British trade 
unions. On trade unions abroad (besides the reports on forjeign 
countries and the colonies of the royal commission on labour), 
sec Kulemann's Die Gewerkschaftsbewegung (Jena, 1900), dealing with 
trade unions in all countries, and the board of trade " Abstract 
of Foreign Labour Statistics " and Labour Gazette, both of which 
give numerous references to the foreign official sources of information 
on trade unions, together with a summary of the statistics which 
they contain. 

III. — Economic Effects of Trade Unionism 
There is no general consensus of opinion as to the extent to 
which trade unions can attain success in achieving the objects 
which they set before themselves, or as to how far their action 
is beneficial or otherwise to the general community. One of the 
principal objects of trade unions being to maintain and increase 
the rates of wages paid to their members, the first question would 
be practically solved if statistical evidence were available to 
connect the course of wages with the action of combinations. 
Such evidence, however, is inconclusive. The period of growth 
of trade unionism in Great Britain has certainly been on the whole 
a period of rising wages. But many other causes tending to 
raise wages have been operative over the same period, and some 
of the facts might be explained as much by the tendency of rising 
wages to strengthen combinations as by that of combinations to 
raise wages. 

Again, the observed fact that the rise has not been confined 
to industries in which organizations are strong might be explained 
either by the supposition that the rise brought about by trade 
unions has benefited a wider circle than their membership, or 
that the rise both within and outside the ranks of trade unions 
is due to causes other than their action. Perhaps the strongest 
statistical evidence of the power of trade unions to affect wages in 
particular districts is afforded by the local differences of wages in 
the same trade, which, it is contended, cannot be wholly explained 
by local differences of cost of living or industrial conditions, but 
which often correspond closely to differences of strength of trade 
union organization. This argument, however, does not touch 
the question of the effect of combination on the general level 
of wages. 

Hardly more conclusive than the reasoning founded on 
statistics have been the attempts to solve the question by pure 
economic theory. During the prevalence of the old view of wages 
known as the " wage-fund " theory, combinations were usually 
held to be powerless to affect the general rate of wages, because 
they could not alter the proportion between capital and popula- 
tion, on which wages were thought to depend. The question 
however, was reopened by the change in theory which led econo- 
mists to regard wages as depending primarily on the productivity 
of industry, and secondarily (and within comparatively narrow 
limits) on the relative power of bargaining as between the labourers 
or groups of labourers and the organizers of labour. According 
to this view, the effect of combinations on the rate of wages will 
ultimately depend, so far as the first and most important factor 
in the problem is concerned, on their effect on the general pro- 
ductiveness of industry. Prima facie, we might expect that trade 
unionism would, on the whole, restrict productiveness, and this 



ECONOMIC EFFECTS] 



TRADE UNIONS 



149 



is undoubtedly a view widely held among employers. Strictly 
professional associations tend generally to become conservative 
so far as methods of work are concerned; and even trade unions 
which may not " officially " oppose the introduction of new pro- 
cesses and the use of machinery may nevertheless serve to focus 
and make effective the hostility felt by the artisan towards 
methods of business organization which seem to him likely to 
decrease the demand for his services or to alter the conditions of 
work to his detriment. In some trades also trade unions are 
charged with encouraging or permitting their members to restrict 
the amount of work performed by them in a given time, with the 
short-sighted object of making more work for others. Many 
unions have attempted also with varying degrees of success to 
keep up the value of their labour by creating an artificial scarcity 
by restricting the numbers entering the trade, and have in 
various ways sought to control the management of business to a 
degree which must restrict the freedom of experiment on which 
the attainment of the maximum productiveness of industry must 
depend. By the resort to strikes — an essentially wasteful method 
of settling differences with employers — they have also to some 
extent restricted production, though the loss directly due to 
this cause is often exaggerated (see Strikes and Lock-Outs) . 
Moreover, by their insistence on the payment to all workmen of a 
fixed " minimum " wage they have diminished the field for the 
profitable employment of the old and less capable, and may io 
some extent have discouraged the expert workman from earning 
and receiving the full reward of his extra ability. 

On the other hand, it is claimed that trade unions have in 
many cases acted in the interests of industrial peace by restrain- 
ing their members from ill-considered strikes, and that, by provid- 
ing a recognized channel through which the workmen's grievances 
may find expression, they have often assisted in adjusting 
differences which would otherwise have led to the interruption 
of production. In particular they have frequently formed a 
convenient basis on which to build a system of conciliation or 
arbitration boards by which strikes are prevented (see Arbitra- 
tion); It is also claimed that by protecting the "standard of 
life" of their members through the policy of securing a 
" minimum " rate of wages, trade unions may tend in the 
long run to build up a physically and industrially superior 
class of workmen, and thus ultimately increase the efficiency of 
industry. 

The comparative weight of the above considerations differs 
according to the point of view from which the question is 
regarded. At any given time an individual employer may 
tend to feel most strongly the disadvantages of the restrictions 
under which he is placed by the action of a particular trade 
union, and may attach but little importance to the general 
effects, in the long run, on the national output of the pressure 
which such combinations exercise-7-which from the point of 
view of the general well-being of the community is by far 
the most important consideration. Generally speaking, any 
action of trade unions tending to diminish the efficiency and 
industry of the individual workman is as injurious to the com- 
munity as to the individual employer, except in so far as such 
restriction may conceivably affect the health of the working 
community from over-strain. But the policy of " levelling up" 
the standard rate of wages, which may mean loss or ruin to 
a particular employer, may nevertheless act quite otherwise with 
respect to the national well-being, in so far as it tends to eliminate 
the " unfit" employer and to concentrate the industry in the 
hands of the more capable and more enterprising of the employ- 
ing class, and in the localities most suited for the purpose. The 
pressure of rising wages has undoubtedly acted as a stimulus to 
the invention of labour-saving devices and the adoption of 
economical methods, as is shown in America, where the highest 
wages are often seen concurrently with the lowest labour cost. 
Advocates of trade unionism sometimes lay much stress on this 
aspect of their operation. On the other hand, it must not be 
forgotten that competition, both as between different grades of 
employing ability and of local advantages, is now international, 
and that the concentration of an industry in the most suitable 



localities and in the hands of the most capable organizers, which 
is claimed as a beneficial result of trade union action, may for 
any particular country mean the transference of the industry 
abroad; and this transference, especially in the case of indus- 
tries dependent on export to neutral markets, may involve a 
considerable national loss. 

Apart from the effect of trade unions on the total amount of 
the " national dividend," their supporters claim that they are 
able to alter the mode of distribution of this dividend. It is not 
usually claimed that they are able to affect the proportion of the 
total product which is paid as rent or interest for the use of the 
instruments of production, but that they can alter the pro- 
portions in which the residue is shared between the organizers of 
labour and the manual labouring class, to the advantage of the 
latter. The methods by which trade unions seek to achieve this 
result require separate examination. 

The first group of methods are those which aim at creating a 
scarcity of some particular kind of labour so as to alter the 
relation of demand and supply. The particular methods em- 
ployed for this purpose have been already sufficiently described. 
W ith regard to all of them it may be remarked that they are 
ineffective as regards the raising of the general rate of wages 
throughout the country (i.e. the average income per head of the 
manual labour classes), seeing that an artificial scarcity of one 
sort of labour implies a redundancy of some other kind. As 
regards the rate of wages in particular occupations there is no 
doubt but that at least for a time such methods may cause a 
considerable rise of wages, only limited at first by the imperfec- 
tion of the control exercised by the union over the number com- 
peting in the labour market and by the extent to which the rise 
in the cost of production so caused is checked by the competition 
of goods imported from abroad, or of alternative commodities, 
or by the loss of foreign markets, or the diminution of home 
demand. But as time goes on other forces of a more subtle 
kind tend to come into play which further limit the power 
of the combination to keep up wages through restricting the 
supply of labour. Besides the substitution of alternative com- 
modities, alternative processes of production may be invented, 
diminishing the demand for the services of the members of 
the exclusive trade union, while the artificial rise of wages 
is also likely to attract labour into the trade. 

Generally speaking, it may be said that while the artificial 
restriction of the supply of workmen in a trade may raise wages 
for a time, it calls into play forces tending to restore the equili- 
brium of demand and supply by diminishing demand, and that 
these forces grow progressively stronger as time goes on, while 
the restrictive capacity of the combination usually tends to 
diminish. This is apart from the fact that restriction of the supply 
of labour entering a trade almost always involves the narrowing 
of the field of ability from which the trade can be recruited, and 
thus a lowering of the general standard of efficiency. 

The other group of trade union methods which requires exami- 
nation is that which aims at strengthening the economic position 
of the labourer by substituting collective for individual negotia- 
tions as regards wages, supported by a common reserve fund out 
of which the labourer may be maintained while waiting for his 
terms to be accepted. Undoubtedly these methods of mutual 
insurance and collective bargaining afford a powerful instrument 
for preventing " sweating " and for enabling the whole body of 
workmen to exact at the earliest moment and retain to the latest 
moment the full amount of the wages which a given state of trade 
and prices will enable the industry to support. The establish- 
ment of general working rules and standards of time or piece wages 
throughout a trade or district may also serve to protect the better 
and more capable employers against their more inefficient or 
unscrupulous competitors, and thus tend .towards the survival 
of the " fittest" among the employing class. It is always to be 
remembered that the effect of collective bargaining is not in the 
long run one-sided. Combinations of workmen beget counter- 
combinations of employers, and the conditions of important 
industries tend to be settled more and more by " treaties " con- 
cluded between powerful bodies of employers and employed.

Were the combinations on both sides which enter into these 
agreements conterminous with the entire trades which they 
represent, and especially if the trades were protected from foreign 
competition, the interests of the general unorganized mass of 
consumers might conceivably suffer from these agreements. 

As regards the future prospects of trade unions in Great 
Britain it is difficult to prophesy. The hopes of those who look 
for a universal expansion of these organizations so as to include 
the whole or the majority of the members of the manual-labour 
classes are probably extravagant. Not less chimerical is the 
expectation of the opponents of trade unions that a few defeats at 
the hands of determined employers or employers' organizations 
will permanently cripple them and lead to their decay and extinc- 
tion. Probably for many years trade unions will include, as 
now, in their membership a powerful minority of the working 
classes, wielding an influence out of all proportion to their actual 
numbers. It is to be expected that experience and the spread of 
education may cause them gradually to abandon the rules and 
methods which interfere most with the economical application 
of labour and capital to industry. 

Lastly, it may be pointed out that trade unionism has been 
the result of the growth of a class of manual workmen working 
for wages for employers who provide the materials and instru- 
ments of industry, and into whose ranks it is relatively difficult 
for the average workman to rise. It remains to be proved 
whether the class feeling which enables powerful trade unions 
to flourish can permanently be fostered and maintained except 
among workmen who expect to remain workmen most of their 
lives. If these conditions should be materially altered, trade 
unionism in its present form must decay or undergo a profound 
alteration. ■ (X.) 

IV. — United States 

Trade unions in the United States are best treated from the 
broad standpoint of labour organizations generally, i.e. associa- 
tions of wage-earners having for their general purpose the 
improvement of their members, either through a lessened working 
day, increased wages, or more satisfactory rules and conditions 
of employment. They may or may not admit employers, but as 
a rule they do not admit them. Sometimes they are formed for a 
specific purpose, like the Eight-Hours League, but generally 
they have platforms comprehending all the demands which labour 
Labour usually makes. Labour organizations in the United 
Orgaalza' States cannot be given a definite birthday. Prior to 
tioas. x g 2 £ there were very few of them. In colonial days 

we have hints of their existence, but their purpose was partly 
political, and their membership often consisted of politicians. 
The purpose of the Caulkers' Club, in the early days of Massa- 
chusetts, was " to lay plans for introducing certain persons into 
places of trust and power." Tradition has it that the word 
" caucus " was derived from this club. It is also said that Samuel 
Adams's father, as early as 1724, was active in the club's work. 
There was probably a union of journeymen bakers in the city of 
New York in 1741 and of shoemakers in Philadelphia in 1792. 
The shipwrights of New York City were incorporated on the 3rd 
of April 1803, and the tailors and carpenters of that city were 
organized in 1806. The New York Typographical Society was in 
existence in 181 7, and was probably organized in the early years 
of the 19th century. Peter Force was its president for a time, and 
Thurlow Weed was a member. A strike occurred in Mr Weed's 
office in 1821 on account of the employment of a non-union man, 
who was then designated a " rat." In 1823 was organized the 
Columbian Charitable Society of Shipwrights and Caulkers of 
Boston and Charlestown. 

The period from 1825 to i860 may be called the formative 
period. About 1825, and for some years afterwards, there was a 
general discussion of socialistic theories, growing out 
Period. V& °* R° Der t Owen's experiments at New Lanark, in 
Scotland, and out of his communistic attempt at New 
Harmony, Indiana, in 1825. The wave of philosophic transcen- 
dentalism also, which swept over the country between 1825 and 
1840, affected not only social but industrial life. Labour papers 
began to be established. The Working Man's Advocate, published 



in New York City in 1S25, was probably the very first American 
labour journal. Soon afterwards there appeared the Daily 
Sentinel and Young America, projected by two Englishmen, 
George Henry Evans and Frederick W. Evans. The chief 
demands advocated by these journals were the freedom of public 
lands, the breaking up of monopolies, the adoption of a general 
bankruptcy law, a lien for the labourer upon his work for his 
wages, the abolition of imprisonment for debt, equal rights for 
women with men, and the abolition of chattel and wage slavery. 
These demands were endorsed by over 600 newspapers. In 1830 
a Working-man's Convention was held in Syracuse, New York, 
the outcome of which was the nomination of Ezekiel Williams 
for governor. In 1832 a delegated convention which met in the 
state house at Boston initiated the 10-hours movement. The 
Tribune (New York), under the leadership of Horace Greeley, 
was opened to the advocacy of Fourierism, and so on all hands the 
movement towards organization was helped. In 1845 the New 
England Working Man's Association was organized, and such men 
as Charles A. Dana, George Ripley, Albert Brisbane, Wendell 
Phillips, William Lloyd Garrison, Theodore Parker, and others 
participated in its meetings. The first industrial congress of the 
United States was convened in the city of New York on the 12th 
of October 1845, but little came of it. Other and more important 
labour congresses were held in that city and in Chicago in 1847 
and 1850 respectively. During the latter part of the formative 
period, that is, from 1825 to i860, most of the great national 
trade unions that are now influential were projected and organ- 
ized, though their great and rapid growth has been since the Civil 
War. The National Typographical Union was organized in 
1852, its name being changed to International in 1862 in order to 
admit Canadian members; the National Union of Hat Finishers 
in 1854; the Iron Moulders' Union of North America on the 5th of 
July 1859; and in the same year the Machinists' and Blacksmiths* 
Union of North America. By i860 the national unions already 
formed numbered 26. 

During the next few years, among other important organiza- 
tions, were instituted what are known as the group of railway 
brotherhoods, the oldest and largest of which is the Railway 
International Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers. Brother* 
The grand division was founded at Detroit, Michigan, hoods. 
on the 17th of August 1863, under the name of the Brotherhood 
of the Footboard. The society was reorganized under its present 
title at Indianapolis, Ind., on the 17th of August 1864. The second 
national association of railway employes that was organized 
was the Conductors' Brotherhood, formed at Mendota, Illinois, 
on the 6th of July 1868, by the conductors from various railways 
in the United States. This brotherhood was recognized, and a 
general governing board established, on the 1 5th of December 
of the same year. Ten years later the name of the organization 
was changed from the Conductors' Brotherhood to the Order 
of Railroad Conductors of America. The Brotherhood of 
Locomotive Firemen was organized at Port Jervis, N.Y., on the 
1st of December 1873. The Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen 
was organized at Oneonta, N.Y., on the 23rd of September 1883. 
It was called the Brotherhood of Railroad Brakemen until the 
1st of January 1890, when the present name was adopted. The 
Brotherhood of Railroad Trackmen is one of the younger and 
smaller organizations. The first efforts to found it were made 
in the spring of 1887, but its permanent organization took place 
a year later. The Brotherhood 0/ Railroad Carmen of America 
was founded on the 9th of September 1890, by the consolidation 
of the Carmen's Mutual Aid Association, the Brotherhood of 
Railroad Car Repairers, the Car Inspectors, Repairers and 
Oilers' Protective Association and the Brotherhood of Railroad 
Carmen of Canada. The Switchmen's Union of North America 
is the outgrowth of the Switchmen's Mutual Aid Association, 
the present organization dating from 1897. Several of these 
railway brotherhoods suffered materially in their membership 
and influence through the organization of the American 
Railway Union in 1893. 

The Cigar-Makers' National Union dates from 1864, the 
Bricklayers' and Masons' International Union from the 17th of

October 1865, the United States Wool Hat Finishers' Association 
from 1S69 and the National Union of Horseshoers of the United 
States from 1875. The Amalgamated Association of Iron and 
Steel Workers resulted, as its name signifies, from the consolida- 
tion of various other orders and societies, the present order 
being organized at Pittsburg in August 1876. The consolidated 
societies were known previously to the new order 
Uaioas 1 of things as the United Sons of Vulcan, the Associated 
Brotherhood of Iron and Steel Heaters, Rollers and 
Roughers of the United States, and the Iron and Steel Roll 
Hands 7 Union. The oldest was the United Sons of Vulcan, 
originating in Pittsburg on the 17th of April 1858, and afterwards 
called the Iron City Forge. The organization is now known as 
the Amalgamated Association of Iron, Steel and Tin Workers. 
The Granite Cutters* National Union was organized in 1877, the 
Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners in 1881 and the Journey- 
men Bakers' National Union in 1886. 

There have also been attempts to organize labour on a 
general or universal plan. The first of these was the Inter- 
national Association of Working-men, known as the " Inter- 
national," which was organized in London in the autumn of 
1864. This society sought to associate working-men wherever 
manufacturing has been extended. The International grew 
for a while, but never at any time had a member- 
The later* ^^ excee ding ioo,ooo and probably never over 
50,000. It did not extend to the United States with 
much force; certainly no large number of the working-men of the 
country were involved in it, and branches were not organized 
in the union until 1870 or 1871. 

The second attempt was the Noble Order of Knights of Labour 
of America, which was founded in Philadelphia on Thanks- 
giving Day 1869; through the efforts of Uriah S. 
labour ° f Stephens and six associates, all garment-cutters. 
For several years the garment-cutters of Philadelphia 
had been organized as a trade union, but failed to maintain 
satisfactory rates of wages. Dissatisfaction prevailed, and 
resulted in the autumn of 1869 in the disbandment of the union. 
Stephens, who was a far-seeing man, and anticipated the dis- 
ruption of his union, had prepared the outlines of a plan for an 
organization embracing, as he said, " all branches of honourable 
toil." He advocated education, co-operation and an intelligent 
use of the ballot as the proper means for gradually abolishing 
the present wage-system. The order had a varied career. 
Mr Stephens, himself a Mason, brought into the ritual of the 
new order many of the features of speculative Masonry. The 
obligations were in the nature of oaths, taken with much 
solemnity upon the Bible, and the members were sworn to the 
strictest secrecy. The order was known for a long time as 
" Five Stars," that designation being used in printing and 
writing. Many expressions taken from Greek literature were 
introduced into the ceremonies. The instructions given to 
every person admitted into the order are perhaps the best 
exponent of the nature of the ritual: — 

Labour is noble and holy. To defend it from degradation; to 
divest it of the evils to body, mind and estate which ignorance 
and greed have imposed; to rescue the toiler from the grasp of the 
selfish — is a work worthy of the noblest and best of our race. In 
all the multifarious branches of trade capital has its combinations; 
and, whether intended or not, they crush the manly hopes of labour 
and trample poor humanity in the dust. We mean no conflict 
with legitimate enterprise, no antagonism to necessary capital, 
but men, in their haste and greed, blinded by self-interests, overlook 
the interests of others and sometimes violate the rights of those 
they deem helpless. We mean to uphold the dignity of labour, to 
affirm the nobility of all who earn their bread by the sweat of their 
brows. We mean to create a healthy public opinion on the subject 
of labour (the only creator of values), and the justice of its receiving 
a full, just share of the values or capital it has created. We shall, 
with all our strength, support laws made to harmonize the interests 
of labour and capital, and also those laws which tend to lighten the 
e xhau stive n ess of toil. To pause in his toil, to devote to his own 
interests [sicj, to gather a knowledge of the world's commerce, to 
unite, combine and co-operate in the great army of peace and 
industry, to nourish and cherish, build and develop, the temple he 
lives in, is the highest and noblest duty of man to himself, to his 
fellow men and to his Creator. 



The ritual was neither printed nor written, and in all probability 
there is not now in existence a copy of it. So long as the utmost 
secrecy was retained the order did not grow rapidly; gradually 
it lost its secrecy and worked on more general plans. From 
the best evidence that can be secured it is probable that the 
first local assembly of the Knights of Labour was organized 
as early as 1873 in Philadelphia. Attempts at outside organiza- 
tion had been unsuccessful. The second assembly consisted 
of ship carpenters and caulkers employed in Cramp's shipyard. 
After this the order spread quite rapidly, 20 assemblies being 
organized in Philadelphia during 1873. A district assembly, 
consisting of delegates from local assemblies in Philadelphia, 
met in that city on Christmas Day 1873 and organized District 
Assembly No. 1. The order increased during the years follow- 
ing this action, and in 1877 delegates were chosen to organize a 
general assembly. These delegates met at Reading, Pennsylvania, 
on the 1st of January 1878, and organized the first general 
assembly, Mr Stephens, the founder, presiding as temporary 
chairman. Seven states were represented. General assemblies 
have been held' each year since that time, and changes in the 
constitution or work of the order have been the subject of warm 
discussion. At the meeting of the first general assembly the 
membership must have been small, probably only a few 
thousand. It did not reach 50,000 till five years later. The 
general assembly of 1880, at Pittsburg, denounced strikes as 
injurious and not worthy of support except in extreme cases. 
At the fifth session, at Detroit, in 1881, the most important 
actions in the history of the order were taken, and from this 
session the rapid growth of the order may be dated. The 
assembly then declared that on and after the 1st of January 1882 
the name and objects of the order should be made public. 
It also declared that women should be admitted upon an equal 
footing with men, and a strong committee was appointed to 
revise the constitution and the ritual. At the next general 
assembly, September 18S2, in New York, the revised constitu- 
tion was adopted, as well as laws and regulations for support- 
ing strikes. After this the order began to grow rapidly. It 
antagonized the trade unions, the contention being that the 
order embraced higher and grander principles than those 
underlying the organization of the former. The trade unions 
in existence at that time struggled to preserve their organiza- 
tions against what they considered the encroachment of the 
Knights of Labour. The high-water mark of the order was 
probably during 1883, 1884, 1885 and 1886, when, accord- 
ing to the very best information, it numbered not less than 
1,000,000 members. In 1900 its membership was estimated 
at about 130,000. 

The order of the Knights of Labour is based on the federal plan, 
and has a hierarchy of assemblies — the local assembly, the district 
assembly, the state and the general assembly. The _ * , 
officers of the local assembly consist of a master t j?„ aa Z *~ 
workman, worthy foreman, venerable sage, recording 
secretary, financial secretary, ^ treasurer, worthy inspector, 
almoner, statistician and some minor officers. These are elected 
semi-annually by ballot or by acclamation. The district assembly 
is composed of duly accredited delegates from at least five 
local assemblies, and is the highest tribunal of the Knights of 
Labour within its jurisdiction under the general laws of the order. 
It has the power to levy assessments for its maintenance upon all 
locals, and has also the power to establish locals in the territory 
governed by it. The officers and their duties are similar to those 
of the local assembly, except that the master workman is called 
the district master workman. The constitution of the general 
assembly is a very imposing document, containing twenty articles. 
The assembly consists of representatives chosen by the district 
assemblies, and has full and final jurisdiction, being the highest 
tribunal of the order. It alone possesses the power and authority 
to make, amend or repeal the fundamental and general laws of 
the order, to decide finally all controversies arising, and to issue 
charters to state, district and local assemblies. The officers are 
elected at each annual session, and their titles correspond almost 
completely with those of the local and district assemblies, wkh 
the exception that the word " general " takes the place of " dis- 
trict," as " general master workman," &c. The general master 
workmen have been Uriah S. Stephens (the founder of the order), 
Terence V. Powderly, James R. Sovereign, John N. Parsons and 
Henry A. Hicks. The order has a publication known as the Journal 
of the Knights of Labour, published at Washington, D.C.

TRADE UNIONS 



[UNITED STATES 



The third attempt to bring into one order men employed 
in different vocations was the American Railway Union, 
American organized in Chicago on the 20th" of June 1893. 
Railway It included all railway employes born of white 
Union, parents. It was organized for the protection of 
members in all matters relating to wages and their rights as 
employes, and affirmed that such employes were entitled to a 
voice in fixing wages and in determining conditions of employ- 
ment. The union won a great victory on the North-Western 
railway in April 1894, but its action in the great strikes in 
Chicago in 1894 cost it its life. Its membership reached at one 
time 150,000. 

The separate unions found that the co-operation of other 
unions was needed to perfect and extend their work, and 

attempts were made from time to time to organize a 
of Labour.* federated body. The initial steps were taken in 1866, 

when the trades assemblies of New York City and 
Baltimore called a national labour congress, the 100 delegates 
sent by 60 secret and open organizations from different trade 
unions meeting on the 20th of August. In 1867 a second con- 
vention was called to meet in Chicago, the aim being to form a 
Trades Union Congress like that existing in Great Britain. 
The National Labour Union held two conventions in 1868, 
the first in May and the other in September; it met again in 
Chicago in 1869, in Boston in 1870, in Philadelphia in 1871 and 
in Columbus, Ohio, in 1872. This closed the experience of the 
National Labour Union. During 1873, owing to the industrial 
depression, many of the trade unions were suspended. An 
industrial congress met in Rochester, N.Y., in April 1874, 
consisting of some of the leading trade unionists of the United 
States, and on the 14th of that month a convention was held 
representing the Sovereigns of Industry. The expectation was 
that the old National Labour Union should be taken up. The 
Industrial Brotherhood of the United States, another secret 
order, partaking largely of the character of the Knights of 
Labour, was represented in that convention. As might have been 
expected, the two ideas — that on which the Knights of Labour 
was organized and the trade union idea — immediately became 
antagonistic, yet a platform containing most of the principles 
of the Knights of Labour was adopted. The movement ended 
with the Rochester meeting. The years 1875 and 1876 saw 
other attempts; hut they were chiefly political in their character 
and the temporary orders then organized were disbanded. Be- 
tween 1876 and 1881 other attempts were made at federation. 
A call issued jointly by the Knights of Industry and a body 
known as the Amalgamated Labour Union, consisting of some 
dissatisfied members of the Knights of Labour, resulted in a 
convention held at Terre Haute, Ind., on the 2nd of August 1881. 
The chief purpose was to supplant the Knights of Labour by 
the creation of a new secret order. The membership of the 
convention, however, had trade union proclivities and did not 
believe in multiplying labour societies. The secret organization 
was not effected. Another convention was held in Pittsburg, 
on the 19th of November 1881, as the result of the following 
statement: — 

We have^ numberless trades unions, trades assemblies or 
councils, Knights of Labour, and various other local, national and 
international labour unions, all engaged in the noble task of elevat- 
ing and improving the condition of the working classes. But great 
as has been the work done by these bodies, there is vastly more that 
can be done by a combination of all these organizations in a federa- 
tion of trades and labour unions. 

It is claimed that the 107 delegates represented 262,000 workmen. 
Their deliberations resulted in the Federation of Organized 
Trades and Labour Unions of the United States and Canada. 
Its platform differed but very little from that of the Knights 
of Labour, although it was in some respects more comprehensive. 
It demanded eight hours as a day's work; called for national 
and state incorporation of trade unions; favoured obligatory 
education of all children, and the prohibition of their employ- 
ment under the age of fourteen; favoured the enactment of 
uniform apprentice laws; opposed bitterly all contract convict 
labour and the truck system for payment of wages; demanded 



laws giving to working men a first lien on property upon which 
their labour had been expended; insisted upon the abrogation 
of all so-called conspiracy laws; advocated the establishment 
of a national bureau of labour statistics; urged the prohibition 
of the importation of foreign labour; opposed government 
contracts on public work; favoured the adoption by states of an 
employers' liability act; and urged all other labour bodies 
to vote only for labour legislators. The second convention was 
held at Cleveland, O., on the 21st of November 1882. 

The American Federation of Labour is the largest labour 
organization in the United States. It was organized at Columbus, 
O., on the 8th of December 1886, under the name it now bears. 
In 1888 it was declared that it owed its existence to the Federa- 
tion of Organized Trades, &c, founded in i8§i at Pittsburg, and 
that the American Federation meetings or conventions should 
date from that year; hence it is generally stated that the 
Federation was founded in 1881. From the start in 1881 the 
Federation had a constitution, but it revised it at the convention 
held in Baltimore on the 16th of December 1887, under the name 
of the American Federation of Labour. The order is not secret, 
nor do individual members, through local trades unions or 
otherwise, owe any allegiance to it. Its object is the encourage- 
ment and formation 9f local trades and labour unions and the 
closer federation of such societies through the organization 
of central trades and labour unions in every state, and the 
combination of such bodies into state, territorial or provincial 
organizations for the purpose of securing general harmony not 
only in the interests of the working masses, but of legislation. 
While it is a federation, it cannot be called a federal body, 
like the Knights of Labour, although there are local trade unions, 
trade assemblies in cities and state federations; nevertheless, 
there is not the hierarchical character of the other body. Most 
of the trade unions in the United States are affiliated with 
the American Federation. The great railway brotherhoods are 
not so affiliated, except the Amalgamated Association of Rail- 
road Employ6s of America, the Order of Railroad Telegraphers 
and the Brotherhood of Railroad Trackmen. 

The federation has affiliated with it 117 international unions, 
37 state federations, 574 city central bodies and 661 local trade and 
Federal labour unions. The international unions are made up of 
approximately 28,500 local unions. The average membership on 
which dues have been paid was 264,825 in 1897, and ten years later 
the number was 1,538,970. 

The chief officers of the federation are a president, first, second, 
third, fourth, fifth and sixth vice-presidents, treasurer and secretary. 
Samuel Gompers of New York was the first president, holding that 
position till 1894, when he was defeated through the endeavours 
of the Socialist Labour Party, and John M'Bride elected. At the 
next session, however, he was re-elected. The numerical strength 
of the American Federation of Labour is probably not far from 
1,600,000. It maintains a journal called the American Federationist, 
published at Washington, D.C. The doctrine of the federation 
relative to strikes is that each affiliated society has its own 
government, distinct from the government of the national con- 
vention, which has no power to order strikes, such matters being 
left to the affiliated societies, but is advisory and not conclusive 
in its action. 

Unions are often organized for temporary purposes, their 
existence ceasing as soon as the purposes succeed or fail. The 
total number of members of all kinds of labour 
organizations cannot be stated. There are many strength. 
local societies and associations other than those 
belonging to the Knights of Labour or those affiliated with the 
American Federation of Labour, but which are distinctly labour 
bodies. According to the best possible classification there 
are 20,000,000 wage-earners in the United States, including 
men, women and children. The most liberal estimate of the 
membership of all labour organizations places the total at 
2,000,000. This would be about 10% of the whole body of 
wage-workers; but in some occupations, like that of the printing 
trade, the organization probably includes from 75 to 90%. 

The law relating to trade unions varies somewhat in the 
different states. Both the federal legislature and several of 
the states (Massachusetts, New York, Pennsylvania, Michigan, 
Maryland, Iowa, Kansas and Louisiana) have passed laws 
permitting the incorporation of unions. Michigan, Wyoming 



TRADE WINDS— TRAFALGAR, BATTLE OF 



and Nebraska have specially provided for incorporating assem- 
blies of the Knights of Labour. Hardly any advantage, however, 
has been taken of these statutes. Some states have passed laws 
excepting trade unions from restrictions on combinations and 
conspiracies imposed by other statutes or the common law (e.g. 
New York), and especially from the operation of anti-trust laws 
(Michigan, Wisconsin, Nebraska, Montana, North Carolina 
and Texas). The Texas law, however, has been held uncon- 
stitutional. A number of states have passed laws, some of 
doubtful validity, prohibiting employers from making it a 
condition of employment that labourers should not belong to 
a union. Most states have adopted statutes legalizing union 
labels to indicate the products of members of trade unions. 

By act of Congress, associations of the nature of labour 
organizations, having branches in several states or territories, may, 
on filing articles of association for record in Washington, become 
corporations. American legislation generally is friendly to 
trade unions. Their purposes are regarded as lawful by the 
courts, but if they use unlawful means for their accomplish- 
ments, a remedy will be applied. Injury to property, intimida- 
tion by threats, personal violence, or boycotts enforced by 
terrorism, are such unlawful means. The liberty of action 
thus secured to organizations of labour is equally the right of 
the employer. Therefore, a statute making it an offence for 
one to require those whom he employs to withdraw from a trade 
union is unconstitutional and void (see Reports of American 
Bar Association, xxi. 367, 372). The courts recognize 
that membership in trade unions is a species of property, 
of which no one can be deprived except through a formal 
procedure in conformity with the rules of the organization. 
Some of the States, notably New York, have a statute pro- 
hibiting trade unions from making any discrimination in con- 
nexion with their admission requirements on account of 
membership in the state militia or national guard.

TRADE WINDS, the name given to the winds which blow 
from the tropical belts of high pressure towards the equatorial 
belt of low pressure, from the north-east in the northern hemi- 
sphere and from the south-east in the southern. They are 
exceedingly regular, especially over the oceans, where there is 
no disturbing influence from the great land masses. They 
receive their name from this feature, the term " trade " being 
used in the otherwise obsolete sense of " direction " or " course " 
(cf. "tread")- The area of their greatest influence may be 
taken to extend from about 3 to 35 N., and from the equator 
to 28 S.j though these belts are actually somewhat narrower 
at any given season, as the whole system of surface winds over 
the globe moves north and south following the sun. The westerly 
winds prevalent in^ the belts respectively north of the northern 
tropical belt of high pressure, and south of the southern, are 
sometimes known as anti-trades, their direction being opposite 
to that of the trade winds. 

TRAFALGAR, BATTLE OF. The British victory over the 
French off Cape Trafalgar, fought on the 21st of October 1805, 
was a sequel of the breakdown of Napoleon's great scheme for 
the invasion of the British Isles (See Napoleonic Campaigns: 
Naval). When Villeneuve gave up in despair the attempt to 
enter the Channel, he steered for Cadiz, and anchored in that 
port on the 20th of August 1805. He found three British 
ships of the line, under the command of Vice-Admiral Cuthbert 
Collingwood, on the watch. Collingwood, resolved that the 



153 

allies should not drive him through the Straits of Gibraltar 
without being compelled to follow, retired slowly, and at a 
short distance ahead of the ships sent to pursue him. They, 
not being willing to be drawn into the Mediterranean, gave up 
the pursuit. The British officer then resumed his watch off 
Cadiz. On the 22nd of August he was joined by Rear- Admiral 
Sir Richard Bickerton with four ships of the line, and on the 30th 
by Vice-Admiral Sir Robert Calder with 18. The allied fleet, 
consisting of 29 sail of the line which had come with Villeneuve, 
and five already at Cadiz, 34 in all, remained quiescent. The use 
to be made of it, or the measures to be taken for its destruction, 
were matters of urgent consideration to Napoleon and to the 
British government. On the 14th of September Napoleon 
gave orders that the French and Spanish ships at Cadiz should 
put to sea at the first favourable opportunity, join seven Spanish 
ships of the line then at Cartagena, go to Naples, and land the 
soldiers they carried to reinforce his troops then in that king- 
dom, and should fight a decisive action if they met a British 
fleet of inferior numbers. Two Spanish ships of the line were to 
be counted as equal to one French. Their final destination 
was to be Toulon. On the 15th he decided that Villeneuve, 
whose " excessive pusillanimity " rendered him incapable of 
vigorous action, must be replaced by Admiral Rosily. Rosily 
received his orders on the 17th and left for Cadiz. The British 
government, determined to confine the allies to Cadiz, or beat 
them if they came out, sent Nelson to take command and 
prepared to despatch reinforcements. Nelson left Portsmouth 
on the 15th of September, and reached Cadiz on the 28th, 
bringing three ships of the line with him. He gave orders that 
no salute should be fired for him lest the enemy should learn that 
reinforcements had arrived. The bulk of the fleet — 23 sail — was 
kept well out at sea, and five ships of the line under Rear-Admiral 
Louis were appointed to cruise close to Cadiz as an inshore 
squadron. On the 5th of October Louis was sent to Gibraltar 
to renew his provisions and water, and the watch was left to 
two frigates. Between the 7th and the 13th of October Nelson 
was joined by six ships of the line, making a total of 34. But 
Admiral Calder, having been summoned home to stand a 
court-martial, took his flagship with him on the 14th, and on 
the 17th another line-of-battle ship had to be detached to renew 
her stores. As Admiral Louis could not return before the 
battle of the 21st, Nelson had at his disposal 27 ships of the line 
in all. Napoleon's order of the 14th of September reached 
Villeneuve on the 28th. He learnt also that Rosily was coming, 
but not that he himself was to be superseded. On the 5th of 
October he held a council of war of French and Spanish officers. 
They decided that the condition of their ships did not justify 
them in hoping for victory over the British fleet, but Napoleon's 
orders were peremptory, and they agreed that a sortie must be 
made. Easterly winds were needed to facilitate the sailing 
of a large and awkward fleet from Cadiz, and till the 14th the 
wind was hard from the west. Even when it fell the allies 
lingered. On the 18th of October Villeneuve heard that Rosily 
had reached Madrid, and of his own supersession. Stung by 
the prospect of being disgraced before the fleet, he resolved to 
go to sea before his successor could reach Cadiz. 

The allies, aided by a light land breeze which blew from the 
east, though the wind at sea was westerly, began to leave Cadiz 
Bay on the 19th. Their movements were at once known to the 
British look-out frigates, and were transmitted by signal to 
Nelson, who was cruising some thirty miles to the west. During 
the period of blockade he had instructed his captains as to how 
he meant to fight the approaching battle. The memorandum 
in which his instructions were embodied was dated the 9th of 
October. It was drawn up in view of the circumstances which 
did not arise — that the enemy would come to sea with a strong 
easterly wind which would give him the 'weather gage; that he 
might be reinforced to a strength of over 50 ships of the line from 
Brest, Rochefort and Cartagena; that the British fleet might 
be raised by reinforcements to 40 ships.. But the governing 
principles of the memorandum were independent of such 
details. They were that the order of sailing in which the

TRAFALGAR, BATTLE OF 



fleet was when the enemy was seen was to be the order of 
battle; that no time was to be wasted in forming a precise line; 
that the attack was to be made in two bodies, of which one, to 
be led by the second in command, Collingwood, was to be thrown 
on the rear of the enemy, while the other, led by Nelson himself, 
was to take care that the centre and van should not come to the 
assistance of the ships cut off. Nelson was careful to point 
out that " Something must be left to chance. Nothing is sure 
in a sea fight beyond all others "; and he left his captains free 
from all hampering rules by telling them that " No captain 
can do very wrong if he places his ship alongside that of the 
enemy." In short the execution was to be as circumstances 
should dictate, subject to the guiding rule that the enemy's 
rear was to be cut off and a concentration of superior force on 
an inferior sought for. 

The uncertainties of naval warfare in the days of sailing 
ships were fully shown at Trafalgar. The allies, having left 
Cadiz on the 20th of October, were S3 sau " °f tne ^ ne strong, 
one of the fleet having been left behind. They sailed in five 
squadrons. Three were nearer the land than the other two. 
The leading squadron of the three was commanded by the 
Spanish admiral, Alava; Villeneuve followed; and the French 
admiral, Dumanoir, commanded the rear. The other two 
squadrons of six ships of the line each, commanded by the Spanish 
admiral, Gravina, and the French admiral, Magon, were parallel 
with, and outside of the three.* All headed for the Straits of 
Gibraltar in the westerly breezes, which had become very 
light. The British fleet of 27 sail in two divisions also headed 
for the Mediterranean. During the night of the 2oth-2ist of 
October several movements were made to gain position, and 
there was an inevitable tendency to straggle among vessels which 
did not all sail equally well and were moving in light winds. 
On the early morning of the 21st the allies were some twelve 
miles off Cape Trafalgar. The British fleet was some ten or 
twelve miles out at sea to the west of them. Seeing that a 
battle would now be forced on him, Villeneuve ordered his 
whole fleet to turn so as to bring their heads on Cadiz. He 
was painfully aware that the incomparably more expert British 
fleet would not be content to attack him in the old-fashioned 
way, coming down in a parallel line and engaging from van to 
rear. He knew that they would endeavour to concentrate on 
a part of his line. But Villeneuve was too conscious of the 
inexperience of his officers and men to think it possible to make 
counter movements with them. It has been said that the 
French and Spanish ships which had taken part in the late 
cruise to the West Indies and back must be considered as 
trained in the same sense as the British. But apart from the 
fact that these vessels formed 'little more than a half of the 
allied fleet, the comparison is childish. It could only have 
occurred to writers who, wishing to exalt the glory of Trafalgar, 
forget that the superior quality of the British fleet, the fruit 
of foresight, of good sense, and the strenuous work of a people, 
was itself the best of all claims to honour. A hasty cruise 
across the Atlantic and back was no equivalent for years of 
training. The blockades maintained by the British fleet had 
made it difficult for the allies to obtain stores and their ships 
were ill fitted. Their crews contained a minute proportion of 
men bred to the sea, and as they had to be taught the elements 
of seamanship on the few occasions when they got to sea, their 
gunnery was neglected. There was valour in the allied fleet, 
but there was neither skill nor confidence. Moreover the very 
light wind then blowing rendered manoeuvring all but im- 
possible for the most expert crews. Villeneuve could do nothing 
more than order his fleet to turn so as to bring the ships' heads 
on Cadiz, to form the line, and await the enemy's attack. He, 
however, left his captains free to act for the best when the 
battle had begun, by telling them that whoever was not under 
fire was not at his post. The movement of conversion ordered 
at 6 o'clock a.m. was not executed till about 10 o'clock, and it 
was ill done. The three squadrons nearest the shore turned 
first, the rear beginning, to leave room for the others. Thus 
Dumanoir now led the van and Alava followed Villeneuve. 



The two squadrons of Gravina and Magon, which had been 
outside, fell in behind Alava. No accurate line was formed. 
The allies drifted rather than sailed into a curve of some five 
miles long, stretching from north to south, concave on the west 
side, and more pronounced at the southern than at the northern 
end. Their ships did not follow one another, but were in many 
cases two, and in some cases three, abreast in groups. To 
some extent this was to their advantage, as the effective range 
of fire of the artillery of the day was barely 1200 yds., and as 
the power of concentrating the fire of guns out of ports was 
limited, the danger to an assailant bearing down was not great 
during his approach. The peril was that he would be engaged 
with two or three enemies when he had broken into the line, 
and this risk was increased by the accidental group formation 
of the allies. 

The confidence and promptitude of the British fleet presented 
a marked contrast to the passivity of the allies. When in the 
early morning the enemy was seen to the east, Nelson's fleet 
was in two divisions, somewhat scattered — his own of 12 sail 
of the line being to the westward and windward in the light 
breeze from W.N.W.; Collingwood's of 15 sail being to leeward 
and east. At 6.40 the signal was made to form the order of 
sailing and prepare for battle. The enemy's movement of 
conversion was already seen, and it was obvious that unless 
he were rapidly stopped he might reach Cadiz Bay in safety. 
A few minutes before 7 o'clock the signal to bear up, No. 76, 
was made by Nelson. Much discussion has arisen as to whether 
this was an order to bear up together, or in succession; the 
first if exactly executed would have caused the British ships 
to approach the enemy in a line abreast (side by side) since all 
would have turned at once; the second would have caused 
them to approach in a line ahead (one after the other) since they 
would have turned successively. The discussion is in reality 
futile, because the want of wind rendered it impossible to 
arrange exact formations, because it had been decided that 
no time should be wasted in dressing the line, and because 
Nelson's flagship, the " Victory " (100), and Collingwood's 
flagship, the " Royal Sovereign " (100), were quick-sailing 
vessels, and both admirals moved at the best attainable speed. 
The slow ships could not keep up with them. The two 
squadrons went down heading to north of east, Collingwood 
to the right and leeward, Nelson to the north and windward, 
in two bodies without exact formation, according to the 
speed of the ships. Collingwood headed for the centre, and 
the pronounced curve at the south end of the allied line 
caused the ships of his division to come into action in a close 
approach to a parallel with the enemy. The " Royal Sovereign " 
was the first British ship to break into the enemy's line, which 
she did about midday and astern of Alava's flagship the " Santa 
Ana." She was alone for a few minutes, but the ships of 
Collingwood's division, as they sailed into the curve, were mostly 
able, by steering to the right, to get into action very soon after 
their admiral. Nelson's division was headed by himself to 
cut through the enemy between his van and centre, and to bar 
his road to Cadiz. It was certainly in a nearer approach to a 
line ahead than Collingwood's. After making a demonstra- 
tion at the allied van, he broke into their line astern of the 
" Bucentaure " (100), the flagship of Villeneuve. 

The exact movements of all the ships engaged could only 
be given in a very detailed account of the battle, but the main 
lines of the action are already indicated. To the allies it 
appeared that the British fleet assailed them in two lines con- 
verging on their centre, and that it then carried out a concen- 
tration on this part of their line. Though this is too simple — 
or too bald — a statement of the case, it does not go far from 
the truth. The allied formation was broken in two, and though 
the rear part was kept well in play by Collingwood's division, 
the severest blows fell on the central sections. 

The battle, which began at midday, was terminated about 
fiver Eighteen of the allies were taken. Their van, after 
long remaining quiescent, made a futile demonstration, and 
then sailed away. The four van ships which escaped with

Admiral Dumanoir were met and captured off Cape Ortegal 
on the 4th of November by a British squadron of five ships 
under Sir Richard Strachan. The stormy weather which 
followed the battle gave the enemy an opportunity to retake 
some of the prizes, and others were lost. Four only were 
carried into Gibraltar by the British fleet — three French and 
one Spanish. Only eleven of the allied fleet succeeded in 
finding • safety in Cadiz. The fragment of the French squadron 
remained there under Admiral Rosily till he was forced to 
surrender to the Spaniards in 1808 on the breaking out of the 
Peninsular War. The loss of life of the allies cannot be stated 
with precision. In the British fleet the reported loss in killed 
and wounded was 1690, of whom 1452 belonged to 14 out of 
the 27 ships of the line present — the inequality of loss being 
mainly due to the fact that it was as a rule these vessels which 
came earliest into action. For the circumstances of Nelson's 
death see the article Nelson. 

Authorities. — Accounts of the battle of Trafalgar are to be found 
in all the naval, and most of the general, histories of the time. ^ The 
most essential of the original authorities are collected by Sir N. 
Harris Nicolas in his DespatcJies and Letters of Vice- Admiral Lord 
Viscount Nelson, vol. vii. (London 1844-1846). The controversy 
as to the exact method on which the battle was fought, and the 
significance of the signal to bear down, is fully worked out with many 
references to authorities in The Times from the 14th of July to the 
2 1st of October 1905, both in a general correspondence and in a series 
of articles on " Trafalgar and the Nelson Touch," 16th, 19th, 22nd, 
26th, 28th and 30th of September 1905; see also J. S. Corbett, The 
Campaign of Trafalgar (1910). (D. H.) 

TRAFFIC, properly the interchange or passing of goods or 
merchandise between persons, communities or countries, 
commerce or trade. The term in current usage is chiefly 
applied collectively to the goods, passengers, vehicles and 
vessels passing to and fro over the streets, roads, sea, rivers, 
canals, railways, &c. 

The origin of the word is obscure. It occurs in Fr. trafique, and 
trafiquer, Ital. traffico, trafficare, Sp. trafago, trafagar. Du Cange 
(Gloss. Med. el Inf. Lai?) quotes the use of traffigare from a treaty 
between M ilan and Venice of 1380, and gives other variants of the word 
in medieval Latin. There is a medieval Latin word transfegator, an 
explorer, spy, investigator (see Du Cange, op. cit., s.v.) which occurs 
as early as 1243, and is stated to be from transfegare, a corruption of 
transfretare, to cross over the sea (trans, across, fretum, gulf, strait, 
channel). Diez (Etymologisches Worterbuch der romanischen 
Sprachen) connects the word with Port, trasfegar, to decant, which 
he traces to Late Lat. vicare t to exchange, Lat. vicis, change, turn. 
A suggestion (Athenaeum, app. 7, 1900) has been made that it is 
to be referred to a late Hebrew corruption (traffik) of Gr. tpottcukSs, 
pertaining to a trophy, applied to a silver coin with the figure of 
victory upon it and termed in Latin vicloriatus. 

TRAHERNE, THOMAS (i637?-i674)> English writer, was, 
according to Anthony a Wood, a " shoemaker's son of Hereford." 
He entered Brasenose College, Oxford, in 1652, and after 
receiving his degree in 1656 took holy orders. In the 
following year he was appointed rector of Credenhill, near 
Hereford, and in 1661 received his M.A. degree. He found 
a good patron in Sir Orlando Bridgeman, lord keeper of the 
seals from 1667 to 1672. Traherne became his domestic 
chaplain and also " minister " of Teddington. He died at 
Bridgeman's house at Teddington on or about the 27th of 
September 1674. He led, we are told, a simple and devout life, 
and was well read in primitive antiquity and the fathers. His 
prose works are Roman Forgeries (167 3) , Christian Ethics (1675), 
and A Serious and Pathelicall Contemplation of the Mercies 
of God (1699). His poems have a curious history. They were 
left in MS. and presumably passed with the rest of his library 
into the hands of his brother Philip. They then became appar- 
ently the possession of the Skipps of Ledbury, Herefordshire. 
When the property of this family was dispersed in 1888 the 
value of the MSS. was unrecognised, for in 1896 or 1897 they 
were discovered by Mr W. T. Brooke on a street bookstall. 
Dr Grosart bought them, and proposed to include them in his 
edition of the works of Henry Vaughan, to whom he was 
disposed to assign them. He left this task uncompleted, and 
Mr Bertram Dobell, who eventually secured the MSS., was 
able to establish the authorship of Thomas Traherne. The 



discovery included, beside the poems, four complete " Cen- 
turies of Meditation," short paragraphs embodying reflexions 
on religion and morals. Some of these, evidently autobio- 
graphical in character, describe a childhood from which the 
" glory and the dream " was slow to depart. Of the power 
of nature to inform the mind with beauty, and the ecstatic 
harmony of a child with the natural world, the earlier poems, 
which contain his best work, are full. In their manner, as 
in their matter, they remind the reader of Blake and Words- 
worth. Traherne has at his best an excellence all his own, 
but there can be no reasonable doubt that he was familiar both 
with the poems of Herbert and of Vaughan. The poems on 
childhood may well have been inspired by Vaughan's lines 
entitled The Retreat. His poetry is essentially metaphysical 
and his workmanship is uneven, but the collection contains 
passages of great beauty. 

See Bertram Dobell's editions of the Poetical Works (1906) and 

Centuries of Meditation (1908). 

TRAILL, HENRY DUFF (1842-1900), British author and 
journalist, was born at Blackheath on the 14th of August 1842. 
He belonged to an old Caithness family, the Traills of Rattar, 
and his father, James Traill, was stipendiary magistrate of 
Greenwich and Woolwich. H. D. Traill was sent to the Merchant 
Taylors' School. He rose to be head of the school and obtained 
a scholarship at St John's College, Oxford. He was destined for 
the profession of medicine and took his degree in natural sciences 
in 1865, but then read for the bar, being called in 1869. In 
1871 he received an appointment in the education office which 
left him leisure to cultivate his gift for literature. In 1873 he 
became a contributor to the Pall Mall Gazette, then under the 
editorship of Frederick Greenwood. He followed Greenwood 
to the St James's Gazette when in 1880 the Pall Mall Gazette took 
for a time the Liberal side, and he continued to contribute 
to that paper up to 1895. In the meantime he had also joined 
the staff of the Saturday Review, to which he sent, amongst 
other writings, weekly verses upon subjects of the hour. Some 
of the best of these he republished in 1882 in a volume called 
Recaptured Rhymes, and others in a later collection of Saturday 
Songs (1890). He was also a leader-writer on the Daily Tele- 
graph, and acted for a time as editor of the (Sunday) Observer. 
In 1897 he became first editor of Literature, when that weekly 
paper (afterwards sold and incorporated with the Academy) 
was established by the proprietors of The Times , and directed 
its fortunes until his death. Traill's long connexion with 
journalism must not obscure the fact that he was a man of letters 
rather than a journalist. He wrote best when he wrote with least 
sense of the burden of responsibility. His playful humour and 
his ready wit were only given full scope when he was writing 
to please himself. One of his most brilliant jeux d* esprit was 
a pamphlet which was published without his name soon after 
he had begun to write for the newspapers. It was called The 
Israelitish Question and the Comments of the Canaan Journals 
thereon (1876). This told the story of the Exodus in articles 
which parodied very cleverly the style of all the leading journals 
of the day, and was at once recognized as the work of a born 
humorist. Traill sustained this reputation with The New 
Lucian, which appeared in 1884 (2nd ed., with several new 
dialogues, 1900); but for the rest his labours were upon more 
serious lines. He directed the production of a vast work on 
Social England in 1893-1898; he wrote, for several series of 
biographies, studies of Coleridge (1884), Sterne (1882), Wil- 
liam III. (1888), Shaftesbury (1886), Strafford (1889), and Lord 
Salisbury (189T); he compiled a biography of Sir John Franklin, 
the Arctic explorer (1896); and after a visit to Egypt he pub- 
lished a volume on the country, and in 1897 appeared his book 
on Lord Cromer, the man who had done so much to bring it 
back to prosperity. Of these the literary studies are the best, 
for Traill possessed great critical insight. He published two 
collections of essays: Number Twenty (1892), and The New 
Fiction (1897). In 1865 his Glaucus; a tale of a Fish, was 
produced at the Olympic Theatre with Miss Nellie Farren in 
the part of Glaucus. In conjunction with Mr Robert Hichens

he wrote The Medicine Man, produced at the Lyceum in 1898. 
He died in London on the 21st of February 1900. 

TRAIN (M. Eng. trayn or trayne, derived through Fr. from 
Late Lat. trahinare, to drag, draw, Lat. trakere, cf. trail, trace, 
ultimately from the same source), a general term applied to that 
which is drawn or trailed behind or after anything else, the hind 
part or rear of anything. It is thus used of the portion of a 
skirt, robe or cloak which is lengthened behind so that when 
allowed to fall it trails along the ground. In ceremonial pro- 
cessions and other state functions the duty of keeping raised the 
train of the sovereign's robes, or of the robes of great officials 
and dignitaries, is assigned to pages or to official train-bearers. 
The length of the train which ladies must wear at royal courts, 
drawing-rooms or other state functions is fixed by regulations 
from the lord chamberlain's office. The chief specific uses of 
the term are for the trail of a gun, that portion of the carriage 
which rests upon the ground when it is unlimbered, the line of 
gunpowder or other combustible material which is used to 
ignite a charge of explosives, and, figuratively, to an ordered 
series or sequence of events, thoughts, &c. The most familiar 
application is to a number of carriages, wagons or trucks coupled 
together and drawn by a locomotive engine on a railway (see 
Railways). A special use of the verb " to train," in the sense 
of to educate, to instruct, to bring into fit and proper con- 
dition, mental, moral or physical, is developed, as in " educate " 
(Lat. educate, literally, to draw out), from the sense of draw- 
ing or bringing out the good qualities aimed at in a course of 
instruction; a specific use is that of training for a race or other 
form of athletics, i.e. getting into fit physical condition. 

TRAJAN [Marcus Ulpius Trajanus] (a.d. 53-117), 
Roman emperor, was born at Italica, in Spain, on the 18th 
of September 52 (or 53). The family to which he belonged 
was probably Italian and not Iberian by blood. His father 
began as a common legionary soldier, and fought his way up 
to the consulship and the governorship of Asia. The younger 
Trajan was rigorously trained by him, and imbued with the 
same principles and tastes. He was a soldier born and bred. 
No better representative of the true old hardy Roman type, 
little softened by either luxury or education, had come to the 
head of affairs since the days of Marius. His training was 
almost exclusively military, but his experience as an officer 
gave him an acquaintance with almost every important province 
of the empire, which was of priceless value to him when he came 
to the throne. For ten years he held a commission as military 
tribune, which took him to many lands far asunder; then he 
filled important posts in Syria and Spain. By the year 89 
he had achieved a considerable military reputation. At that 
time L. Antonius Saturninus headed a rebellion in Germany, 
which threatened seriously to bring Domitian's rule to an end. 
Trajan was ordered in hot haste from Further Spain to the 
Rhine. Although he carried his troops over that long and 
arduous march with almost unexampled rapidity, he only 
arrived after the insurrection had been put down. But his 
promptitude raised him higher in the favour of Domitian, and 
he was advanced to the consulship in 91. Of the next five 
years of his life we know nothing definite. It is not unlikely 
that they were spent at Rome or in Italy in the fulfilment of 
some official duties. When 'the -revolution of 96 came, and 
Nerva replaced the murdered Domitian, one of the most 
important posts in the empire, that of consular legate of Upper 
Germany, was conferred upon Trajan. An officer whose 
nature, as the event showed, was interpenetrated with the 
spirit of legality was a fitting servant of a revolution whose aim 
it was to substitute legality for personal caprice as the dominant 
principle of affairs. The short reign of Nerva really did start 
the empire on a new career, which lasted more than three- 
quarters of a century. But it also demonstrated how impossible 
it was for any one to govern at all who had no claim, either 
personal or inherited, to the respect of the legions. Nerva saw 
that if he could not find an Augustus to control the army, the 
army would find another Domitian to trample the senate under 
foot. In his difficulties he took counsel with L. Licinius Sura, 



a lifelong friend of Trajan, and on the 27th of October in the 
year 97 he ascended the Capitol and proclaimed that he adopted 
Trajan as his son. The senate confirmed the choice and 
acknowledged the emperor's adopted son as his successor. 
After a little hesitation Trajan accepted the position, which 
was marked by the titles of imperator, Caesar and Germanicus, 
and by the tribunician authority. He immediately proceeded 
to Lower Germany, to assure himself of the fidelity of the 
troops in that province, and while at Cologne be received news 
of Ncrva!s death (Jan. 25, 98). The authority of the new 
emperor was recognized at once all over the empire. The novel 
fact that a master of the Romans should have been born on 
Spanish soil seems to have passed with little remark, and this 
absence of notice is significant. Trajan's first care as emperor 
was to write to the senate an assurance like that which had been 
given by Nerva, that he would neither kill nor degrade any 
senator. He ordered the establishment of a temple and cult 
in honour of his adoptive father, but he did not come to Rome. 
In his dealings with the mutinous praetorians the strength of 
the new emperor's hand was shown at once. He ordered a 
portion of the force to Germany. They did not venture to 
disobey, and were distributed among the legions there. Those 
who remained at Rome were easily overawed and reformed. 
It is still more surprising that the soldiers should have quietly 
submitted to a reduction in the amount of the donative or gift 
which it was customary for them to receive from a new emperor, 
though the civil population of the capital were paid their largess 
(congiarium) in full. By politic management Trajan was able 
to represent the diminution as a sort of discount for immediate 
payment, while the civilians had to wait a considerable time 
before their full due was handed to them. 

The secret of Trajan's power lay in his close personal relations 
with the officers and men of the army and in the soldierly 
qualities which commanded their esteem. He possessed 
courage, justice and frankness. Having a good title to military 
distinction himself, he could afford, as the unwarlike emperors 
could not, to be generous to his officers. The common soldiers, 
on the other hand, were fascinated by his personal prowess and 
his camaraderie. His features were firm and clearly cut; his 
figure was tall and soldierly. His hair was already grey before 
he came to the throne, though he was not more than forty-five 
years old. When on service he used the mean fare of the 
common private, dining on salt pork, cheese and sour wine. 
Nothing pleased him better than to take part with the centurion 
or the soldier in fencing or other military exercise, and he 
would applaud any shrewd blow which fell upon his own helmet. 
He loved to display his acquaintance with the career of dis- 
tinguished veterans, and to talk with them of their battles and 
their wounds. Probably he lost nothing of his popularity with 
the army by occasional indulgence in sensual pleasures. Ye*. 
every man felt and knew that no detail of military duty, how- 
ever minute, escaped the emperor's eye, and that any relaxation 
of discipline would be punished rigorously, yet with unwavering 
justice. Trajan emphasized at once his personal control and 
the constitutionality of his sway by bearing on his campaigns 
the actual title of " proconsul, " which no other emperor had 
done. All things considered, it is not surprising that he was 
able, without serious opposition from the army, entirely to 
remodel the military institutions of the empire, and to bring 
them into a shape from which there was comparatively little 
departure so long 35 the army lasted. In disciplinary matters 
no emperor since Augustus had been able to keep so strong a 
control over the troops. Pliny rightly praises Trajan as the 
lawgiver and the founder of discipline, and Vegetius classes 
Augustus, Trajan and Hadrian together as restorers of the 
morale of the army. The confidence which existed between 
Trajan and his army finds expression in some of the coins of 
his reign. 

For nearly two years after his election Trajan did not appear 
in Rome. He had decided already what the great task of 
his reign should be— the establishment of security upon the 
dangerous north-eastern frontier. Before visiting the capital

he determined to put affairs in train for the attainment of this 
object. He made a thorough inspection of the great lines of 
defence between the Danube and the Rhine, and framed and 
partly carried out a vast scheme for strengthening and securing 
them. 

The policy of opposing uncivilized tribes by the construction of 
the limes, a raised embankment of earth or other material, inter- 
sected here and there by fortifications, was not his invention, but 
it owed in great measure its development to him. It is probable 
that the northernmost part of the great limes Germaniae, from the 
Rhine at Rheinbrohl, nearly midway between Coblenz and Bonn, 
to a point on the Main east of Frankfort, where that river suddenly 
changes its course from north to west, was begun by Domitian. 
The extension of this great barrier southwards to the point at which 
it met the limes Raetiae was undertaken by Trajan, though we cannot 
say how far he carried the work, which was not entirely completed 
till long after his time. We may without hesitation follow the 
opinion of Mommsen, who maintains that the limes was not intended, 
like Hadrian's Wall between the Tyne and the Solway, and likethe 
great wall of China, to oppose an absolute barrier against incursions 
from the outside. It was useful as marking definitely the boundary 
of the Roman sway, and as assuring the Romans that no inroad 
could be made without intelligence being had of it beforehand, 
while the limes itself and the system of roads behind it enabled troops 
to be directed rapidly to any threatened point, and the fortified 
positions could be held against large numbers till reinforcements 
arrived. Great importance was no doubt attached to the perfection 
of the lines of communication bearing on the limes. Among a 
people of roadmakers, Trajan was one of the greatest, and we have 
definite evidence from inscriptions that some of the military roads 
in this region were constructed by him. The more secure control 
which the Romans now maintained over the territory^ within the 
limes tended to its rapid civilization, and the Roman influence, if 
not the Roman arms, soon began to affect powerfully the regions 
beyond. 

After his careful survey of the Rhine end of the frontier defences, 
Trajan proceeded to strengthen them in the direction of the Danube. 
From the age of Tiberius onwards the Romans possessed the whole 
southern bank of the river from its source to the Euxine. But 
the precarious tenure of their possession had been deeply impressed 
on them by the disasters and humiliations they had undergone in 
these districts during the reign of Domitian. A prince had arisen 
among the Dacians, Decebalus by name, worthy to be placed at 
the head of all the great barbarian antagonists of Rome. Like 
Maroboduus, he was able to combine the forces of tribes commonly 
hostile to each other, and his military ability almost went the length 
of genius. Domitian attacked him but was compelled to make an 
ignominious peace. He agreed to pay to Decebalus an annual 
subsidy, and to supply him with engineers and craftsmen skilled 
in all kinds of construction, but particularly in the erection of 
fortifications and defensive works. During the nine or ten years 
which had elapsed since the conclusion of this remarkable treaty 
the Dacian prince had immensely strengthened the approaches to 
his kingdom from the Roman side. He had also equipped and drilled 
his formidable army after the Roman fashion. It was impossible 
for a soldier like Trajan to endure the conditions accepted by 
Domitian; but the conquest of Dacia had become oneof the most 
formidable tasks that had ever confronted the empire. Trajan 
no doubt planned a war before he left the Danube for Rome .late 
in 99. 

The arrival of the emperor had been awaited in the capital 
with an impatience which is expressed by Pliny and by Martial. 1 
As he entered the city and went on foot to the Capitol the* 
plaudits of the people were unmistakably genuine. During 
his stay in the city he riveted more firmly still the affections 
both of the senate and of the people. The reconciliation of 
the empire with liberty, inaugurated, as Tacitus says, by Nerva, 
seemed now to be securely achieved. Trajan was absolutely 
open and simple, and lived with men at Rome as he had lived 
with his soldiers while on service. He realized the senate's 
ideal of the citizen ruler. The assurance that no senator should 
suffer was renewed by oath. All the old republican formalities 
were most punctiliously observed — even those attendant on 
the emperor's election to the consulate, so far as they did not 
involve a restoration of the old order of voting at the comitia. 
The veneration for republican tradition is curiously attested 
by the reproduction of many republican types of coin struck 

1 It has been conjectured, not improbably, that the Germania of 
Tacitus, written at this period, had for one of its aims the enlighten- 
ment of the Romans concerning the formidable character of the 
Germans, so that they might at once bear more readily with the 
emperor's prolonged absence and be prepared for the necessity of 
decisive action on the frontier. 



by senatorial officers. Trajan seized every opportunity for 
emphasizing his view that the princeps was merely the greatest 
of the magistrates, and so was not above but under the laws. 
He was determined, he said, to be to his subjects such a ruler 
as he had desired for himself when a subject. Real power 
and influence were accorded to the senate, which had now, by 
the incorporation of members whose origin was provincial, 
become in a manner representative of the whole empire. Trajan 
associated with the senators on equal terms, and enjoyed in 
their company every kind of recreation. All pomp was dis- 
tasteful to him and discarded by him. There was practically 
no court, and no intrigues of any kind were possible. The 
approach to his house was free, and he loved to pass through 
the city unattended and to pay unexpected visits to his friends. 
He thirsted for no senator's blood, and used severity against the 
delatores alone. There was but one insignificant conspiracy against 
him during his whole reign. Though not literary himself, 
Trajan conciliated the literary men, who at all times had close 
relations with the senate. His intimate, M. Licinius, played 
an excellent Maecenas to his Augustus. In his efforts to 
win the affections of Roman society Trajan was aided by 
his wife Plotina, who was as simple as her husband, benevolent, 
pure in character, and entirely unambitious. The hold which 
Trajan acquired over the people was no less firm than that 
which he maintained upon the army and the senate. His 
largesses, his distributions of food, his public works, and his 
spectacles were all on a generous scale. The exhibitions in 
the arena were perhaps at their zenith during his tenure of 
power. Though, for some unexplained reason, he abolished 
the mimes, so beloved of the populace, at the outset of his reign, 
he availed himself of the occasion of his first triumph to restore 
them again. The people were delighted by the removal of the 
imperial exedra (a large chamber with open front) in the circus, 
whereby five thousand additional places were provided. Taxa- 
tion was in many directions reduced, and the financial exactions 
of the imperial officers controlled by the erection of a special 
court. Elaborate precautions were taken to save Italy from 
famine; it is said that corn for seven years' consumption at 
the capital was retained in the granaries. Special encourage- 
ment was given to merchants to import articles of food. The 
corporation of bakers was organized and made more effective 
for the service of the public. The internal trade of Italy was 
powerfully stimulated by the careful maintenance and extension 
of the different lines of road. But the most striking evidence 
of Trajan's solicitude for his people's welfare is found in his 
institution of the alimenta, whereby means were provided for 
the rearing of poor and orphan children in Italy. The method 
had been sketched out by Nerva, but its great development 
was due to Trajan. The moneys allotted by the emperor were 
in many cases supplemented by private benevolence. As a 
soldier, Trajan realized the need of men for the maintenance 
of the empire against the outer barbarians, and he preferred 
that these men should be of Italian birth. He was only carrying 
a step farther the policy of Augustus, who by a system of 
rewards and penalties had tried to encourage marriage and the 
nurture of children. The actual effect of Trajan's regulations 
is hard to measure; they were probably more effectual for 
their object than those of Augustus. The foundations were 
confiscated by Pertinax, after they had existed less than a 
century. 

On the 1st of September in the year 100, when Trajan was 
consul for the third time, Pliny, who had been designated consul 
for a part of the year, was appointed to deliver the " Panegyric " 
which has come down to us, and forms a most important source 
of our knowledge concerning this emperor. Pliny's eulogy of 
Trajan and his denunciation of Domitian are alike couched in 
extravagant phrases, but the former perhaps rests more uniformly 
on a basis of truth and justice than the latter. The tone of the 
" Panegyric" certainly lends itself to the supposition of some 
historians that Trajan was inordinately vain. That the emperor 
had an honest and soldierly satisfaction in his own well-doing is 
clear; but if hejbad had anything like the vanity of a Domitian,

TRAJAN 



the senate, ever eager to outrun a ruler's taste for flattery, would 
never have kept within such moderate bounds. 

On the 25th of March in the year 101 Trajan left Rome for the 
Danube. Pretexts for a Dacian war were not difficult to find. 
Although there was no lack of hard fighting, victory *in this 
war depended largely on the work of the engineer. The great 
military road connecting the posts in Upper Germany with 
those on the Danube, which had been begun by Tiberius, was 
now extended along the right bank of the river as far as 
the modern Orso va. The campaign of 1 01 was devoted 
mainly to road-making and fortification. In the following 
campaign, after desperate fighting to the north of the Danube 
in the mountainous region of Transylvania, Sarmizegethusa, 
the capital of Deeebalus, was taken, and he was forced to 
terms. He agreed to raze all fortresses, to surrender all 
weapons, prisoners and Roman deserters, and to become a 
dependent prince under the suzerainty of Rome. Trajan came 
back to Italy with Dacian envoys, who in ancient style begged the 
senate to confirm the conditions granted by the commander in 
the field. The emperor now enjoyed his first Dacian triumph, 
and assumed the title of Daeieus. At the same time he royally 
entertained the people and no less royally rewarded his brave 
officers. But the Dacian chief could not school his high spirit 
to endure the conditions of the treaty, and Trajan soon found it 
necessary to prepare for another war. A massive stone bridge 
was built across the Danube, near the modern Turn Severin, by 
Apollodorus, the gifted architect who afterwards designed the 
forum of Trajan. In 105 began the new struggle, which on the 
side of Deeebalus could now only lead to victory or to destruction. 
The Dacians fought their ground inch by inch, and their army 
as a whole may be said to have bled to death. The prince put 
an end to his own life. His kingdom became an imperial pro- 
vince; in it many colonies were founded and peopled by settlers 
drawn from different parts of the empire. The work done by 
Trajan in the Danubian regions left a lasting mark upon their 
history. The emperor returned to the capital in 106, laden with 
captured treasure. His triumph outdid in splendour all those 
that went before it. Games are said to have been held continu- 
ously for four months. Ten thousand gladiators are said to have 
perished in the arena, and eleven thousand beasts were killed in 
the contests. Congratulatory embassies came from all lands, 
even from India. The grand and enduring monument of the 
Dacian wars is the noble pillar which still stands on the site of 
Trajan's forum at Rome. 

The end of the Dacian wars was followed by seven years of 
peace. During part of that time Pliny was imperial legate in 
the provinces cf Bithynia and Pontus, and in constant communi- 
cation with Trajan. The correspondence is extant and gives 
us the means of observing the principles and tendencies of the 
emperor as a civil governor. 

The provinces (hitherto senatorial) were in considerable disorder, 
which Pliny was sent to cure. It is clear from the emperor's letters 
that in regard to nine out of ten of the matters which his anxious 
and deferential legate referred to him for his decision he would 
have been better pleased if the legate had decided them for him- 
self. Trajan's notions of civil government were, like those of the 
duke of Wellington, strongly tinged with military prepossessions. 
He regarded the provincial ruler as a kind of officer in command, 
who ought to be able to discipline his province for himself and 
only to appeal to the commander-in-chief in a difficult case. In 
advising Pljny about the different free communities in the pro- 
vinces, Trajan showed the same regard for traditional rights and 
privileges which he had exhibited in face of the senate at Rome. 
At the same time t< these letters bring home to us his conviction 
that, particularly in financial affairs, it was necessary that local 
self-government m should be carried on under the vigilant super- 
vision of imperial officers. The control which he began in this 
way to exercise, both in Italy and in the provinces, over the " muni- 
cipia " and " liberae civitates," by means of agents entitled (then 
or later) " correctores eivitatium liberarum," was carried continually 
farther and farther by his successors, and at last ended in the com- 
plete centralization of the government. On this account the reign 
of Trajan constitutes a turning-point in civil as in military history. 
In other directions, though we find many salutary civil measures, 
yet there were no far-reaching schemes of reform. Many details 
in the administration of the law, and particularly of the criminal 
law, were improved. To cure corruption in the senate the ballot 



was introduced at elections to magistracies. The finances' of the 
state were economically managed, and taxpayers were most carefully 
guarded from oppression. Trajan never lacked money to expend 
on great works of public utility; as a builder, he may fairly be 
compared with Augustus. His forum and its numerous appendages 
were constructed on a magnificent scale. Many regions of Italy 
and the provinces besides the city itself benefited by the care and 
munificence which the emperor, bestowed on such public improve- 
ments. His attitude towards religion was, like that of Augustus, 
moderate and conservative. The famous letter to Pliny about the 
Christians is, according to Roman ideas, merciful and considerate. 
It was impossible, however, for a Roman magistrate of the time to 
rid himself of the idea that all forms of religion must do homage 
to the civil power. Hence the conflict which made Trajan appear 
in the eyes of Christians like Tertullian the most infamous of 
monsters. On the whole, Trajan's civil administration was sound, 
careful and sensible, rather than brilliant. 

Late in 113 Trajan left Italy to make war in the East. The 
never-ending Parthian problem confronted him, and with it 
were more or less connected a number of minor difficulties. 
Already by 106 the position of Rome in the East had been 
materially improved by the peaceful annexation of districts 
bordering on the province of Syria. The region of Damascus, 
hitherto a dependency, and the last remaining fragment of the 
Jewish kingdom, were incorporated with Syria; Bostra and Petra 
were permanently occupied, and a great portion of the Naba- 
taean kingdom was organized as the Roman province of Arabia. 
Rome thus obtained mastery of the most important positions 
lying on the great trade routes between East and West. These 
changes could not but affect the relations of the Roman with the 
Parthian Empire, and the affairs of Armenia became in 114 the 
occasion of a war. Trajan's campaigns in the East ended in 
complete though brilliant failure. In the retreat from Ctesiphon 
(117) the old emperor tasted for almost the first time the bitter- 
ness of defeat in the field. He attacked the desert city of Hatra, 
westward of the Tigris, whose importance is still attested by grand 
ruins. The want of water made it impossible to maintain a large 
force near the city, and the brave Arabs routed the Roman 
cavalry. Trajan, who narrowly escaped being killed, was forced to 
withdraw. A more alarming difficulty lay before him. Taking 
advantage of the absence of the emperor in* the Far East, and 
possibly by an understanding with the leaders of the rising in 
Armenia and the annexed portions of Parthia, the Jews all over 
the East had taken up arms at the same moment and at a given 
signal. The massacres they committed were portentous. In 
Cyprus 240,000 men are said to have been put to death, and at 
Cyrene 220,000. At Alexandria, on the other hand, many Jews 
were killed. The Romans punished massacre by massacre, and 
the complete suppression of the insurrection was long delayed, 
but the Jews made no great stand against disciplined troops. 
Trajan still thought of returning to Mesopotamia and of avenging 
his defeat at Hatra, but he was stricken with sickness and 
compelled to take ship for Italy. His illness increasing, he 
landed in Cilicia, and died at Selinus early in August 117. 

Trajan, who had no children, had continually delayed to settle 
the succession to the throne/ though Pliny in the Panegyric" 
had pointedly drawn his attention to the matter, and it must have 
causedthe senate much anxiety. Whether Hadrian, the relative 
of Trajan (cousin's son), was actually adopted by him or not is 
impossible to determine; certainly Hadrian had not been advanced 
to any great honours by Trajan. Even his military service had 
not been distinguished. Plotina asserted the adoption, and it 
was readily and most fortunately accepted, if not believed, as 
a fact. 

The senate had decreed to Trajan as many triumphs as he chose 
to celebrate. For the first time a dead general triumphed. When 
Trajan was deified, he appropriately retained, alone among the 
emperors, a title he had won for himself in the field, that of " Par- 
thicus." He was a patient organizer of victory rather than a strategic 
genius. He laboriously perfected the military machine, which when 
once set in motion went on to victory. Much of the work he did 
was great and enduring,but the last year of his life forbade the 
Romans to attribute to him that felicitas which they regarded as an 
inborn Quality of the highest generals. Each succeeding emperor 
was saluted with the wish that he might be " better than Trajan 
and more fortunate than Augustus." Yet the breach made in Trajan's 
felicitas by the failure in the East was no greater than that made 
in the felicitas of Augustus by his retirement from the right bank 
of the Rhine. The question whether Trajan's Oriental policy 
was wise is answered emphatically by Mommsen in the affirmative.

It was certainly wise if the means existed which were necessary 
to carry it out and sustain it. But succeeding history proved that 
those means did not exist. The assertion of Mommsen that the 
Tigris was a more defensible frontier than the desert line which 
separated the Parthian from the Roman Empire can hardly be 
accepted. The change would certainly have created a demand 
for more legions, which the resources of the Romans were not 
sufficient to meet without danger to their possessions on other 
frontiers. 

The records of Trajan's reign are miserably deficient. Our best 
authority is the 68th book of Dio Cassius; then comes the 
" Panegyric " of Pliny, with his correspondence. The facts to be 
gathered from other ancient writers are scattered and scanty. 
Fortunately the inscriptions of the time are abundant and important. 
Of modern histories which comprise the reign of Trajan the best in 
English is that of Merivale; but that in German by H. Schiller 
(Geschichte der romischen Kaiserzeit, Gotha, 1883) is more on a level 
with recent inquiries. There are special works on Trajan by 
H. Francke (Gustrow, 1837), De la Berge (Paris, 1877), and Dierauer 
in M. Budinger's Untersuchungen zur romischen Kaiset 'geschichte ', 
(Leipzig, 1868). A paper by Mommsen in Hermes, iii. pp. 30 seq., 
entitled " Zur Lebensgeschichte des jiingeren Plinius," is important 
for the chronology of Trajan's reign. The inscriptions of the reign, 
and the Dacian campaigns, have been much studied in recent years, 
in scattered articles and monographs. (J. S. R.) 

TRALEE, a market town and seaport, and the county town of 
Co. Kerry, Ireland, on the BallymuUen or Leigh River, about a 
mile from its mouth in Tralee Bay, and on the Great Southern & 
Western railway. Pop. (1901), 9687. A ship canal, permitting 
the passage of ships of 200 tons burden, connects it with 
Tralee Bay. Large vessels discharge at Fenit, 8 m. westward, 
where there is a pier connected with Tralee by rail. Coal, iron 
and timber are imported, and there is a considerable export of 
grain. There is a large trade in butter. Railways serve the 
neighbouring seaside watering-places of Ballybunnion and 
Castlegregory, and the coast scenery of this part is grand and 
varied. Four miles north-west of Tralee is Ardfert, with its 
cathedral, one of the oldest foundations in Ireland, now united 
to the see of Limerick. St Brendan was its original founder, 
and it had once a university, A neighbouring round tower fell 
in 1870. Seven miles north of this again is the fine round 
tower of Rattoo. 

Tralee, anciently Traleigh, the " strand of the Leigh," owes its 
origin to the foundation of a Dominican monastery in 1213 by 
John Fitz-Thomas, of the Geraldine family. During the reign 
of Elizabeth it was in the possession of Earl Desmond, on whose 
forfeiture it came into possession of the Dennys. At the time of 
the rebellion in 1641 the English families in the neighbourhood 
asked to be placed in the castle under the charge of Sir Edward 
Denny, but during his absence a surrender was made. The town 
was incorporated by James I., and returned two members to the 
Irish parliament. Though disfranchised at the Union in 1800, 
it obtained the privilege of returning one member in 1832, but in 
1885 it was merged in the county division. It is governed by an 
urban district council. 

TRALLES (mod. Guzel Hissar), an ancient town of Caria, Asia 
Minor, situated on the Eudon, a tributary of the Maeander. It 
was reputed an Argive and Thracian colony, and was long under 
Persian rule, of which we hear in the history of Dercyllidas' raid 
from Ephesus in 397 B.C. Fortified and increased by the Seleu- 
cids and Pergamenians, who renamed it successively Seleucia and 
Antiochia, it passed to Rome in 133. Though satirized in a 
famous line (Juv. Sat. iii. 70) as a remote provincial place, it 
had many wealthy inhabitants in the Roman period and, to 
judge by objects discovered there, contained many notable 
works of art. Two of the best marble heads in the Constantinople 
museum came from Tralles; and both in the excavations 
conducted for that museum by Edhem Bey (1904), and by 
chance discoveries, fine-art products have come to light on 
the site. Rebuilt by Andronicus II. about 1280, it was super- 
seded a few years later, after the Seljuk conquest, by a 
new town, founded by the amir Aidin in a lower situation 
(see Aidin). (D. G. H.) 

TRAMORE, a market village and seaside resort of Co. Water^ 
ford, Ireland, on the bay of the same name, 7 m. S. of the city 
of Waterford, and the terminus of the Waterford & Tramore 
railway. The situation is pleasant, and the neighbouring coast 



exhibits bold cliff scenery. The bay is open to the south, 
and is dangerous to navigators, as in foggy weather it has been 
frequently mistaken for the entrance to Waterford Harbour. 
On the cliffs to the west are three towers, one having a 
curious iron figure known as the " metal man," erected as a 
warning to sailors. The bay is divided into an outer part 
and an inner lagoon (the Back Strand) by a spit of sand, with 
a strait, crossed by a ferry at its eastern extremity. . A monu- 
ment commemorates the wreck of the troopship " Seahorse " 
in 1816. Four miles west is Dunhill Castle, well situated on 
a precipitous rock. 

TRAMP, a vagrant, one who " tramps " or walks the roads 
begging from house to house or ostensibly looking for work, but 
with no home and habitually sleeping out or moving on from the 
casual ward of one workhouse to that of another (see Vagrancy). 
The word is the shortened form of " tramper," one who tramps 
01 walks with heavy tread. The term " tramp " is also used of a 
cargo steamer not running on a regular line but passing from 
port to port where freight may be picked up. 

TRAMWAY, a track or line of rails laid down in the public 
roads or streets (hence the American equivalent " street rail- 
way "), along which wheeled vehicles arc run for the conveyance 
of passengers (and occasionally of goods) by animal or mechanical 
power; also a light roughly laid railway used for transporting 
coals, both underground and on the surface, and for other similar 
purposes. The word has been connected with the name of 
Benjamin Outram, an engineer who, at the beginning of the 19th 
century, was concerned in the construction of tram roads, and 
has been explained as an abbreviation for " Outram way." But 
this is clearly wrong, since the word is found much earlier. It 
appears to be of Scandinavian origin and primarily to mean a 
beam of wood, cf. Old Swedish tr&tn> trum, which have that sense. 
In a will dated 1555 reference is made to amending a "higheway 
or tram " in Bernard Castle, wheie a log road seems to be in 
question. In Lowland Scottish " tram " was used both of a 
beam of wood and specifically of such a beam employed as the, 
shaft of a cart, and the name is still often given in England to 
the wheeled vehicles used for carrying coal in mining. " Tram- 
way," therefore, is primarily either a way made with beams of 
wood or one intended for the use of " trams " containing coal 
(see Railway). 

Construction. — The first tramway or street railway designed for 
passenger cars with flanged wheels was built in New York in 
1832. The construction of this tramway does not- appear to 
have been a success, and it was soon discontinued. In 1852 
tramways were revived in New York by a French engineer named 
Loubat, who constructed the track of flat wrought-iron rails with 
a wide, deep groove in the upper surface, laid on longitudinal 
timbers. The groove, which was designed for wheel flanges 
similar to those employed on railways, proved dangerous to the 
light, narrow-tired vehicles of the American type. To meet this 
difficulty a step-rail consisting of a flat plate with a step at one 
side raised about \ in. above the surface was designed and laid at 
Philadelphia in 1855. When tramways were first introduced 
into England by G. F. Train in i860 a rail similar to that laid at 
Philadelphia was adopted. This rail (fig. 1) was made of wrought- 
iron and weighed 50 lb per yard. It was 6 in. wide and had a 
step \ in. above the sole. The rails were spiked to longitudinal 
timbers, which rested on transverse sleepers, and they were laid 
to a gauge of 4 ft. 8£ in. Tramways of this type were laid at 
Birkenhead in i860, at London in 1861, and in the Potteries 
(North Staffordshire) in 1863. The English public, however, 
would not tolerate the danger and obstruction caused by the 
step-rail, with its large area of slippery iron surface, and the tram- 
way laid in London had to be removed, while those at Birkenhead 
and the Potteries were only saved by being relaid with grooved 
rails. Thus, while the step-rail became the standard form used 
in the United States, the grooved-rail became generally adopted 
in Europe. From the tramway point of view the step-rail 
has many advantages. A groove collects ice and dirt, and on 
curves binds the wheel flanges, increasing the resistance to trac- 
tion. A grooved rail is, however, far less of a nuisance to the

ordinary vehicular traffic, and it has come to be largely used in 
the principal cities of America. 

After the passing of the Tramways Act of 1870 the construction 
of tramways proceeded rapidly in England. A flat grooved rail 
supported on a longitudinal timber and laid on a concrete bed 
was generally adopted. The paving consisted of stone setts from

4 to 6 in. in depth, laid on a thin bed of sand and grouted with 
cement, mortar or a bituminous mixture. With the exception of 
the design of the rail and the manner of supporting it on the con- 
crete foundation, which has continually changed, this method of 
constructing the track has varied but little to the present day. 

The flat section of rail which was wanting in vertical stiffness 
soon proved unsatisfactory. A fillet or flange was then added to 
each side, which, bedding into the supporting timber, not only 
increased the vertical strength but also prevented horizontal 
displacement of the rail. With the addition of the side flanges a 
greatly improved method of fixing the rail to the sleepers was 
adopted. The old vertical spike, which was a crude fastening, 
was replaced by a " dog " or double-ended side spike, one end 
of which was driven through a hole in the flange of the rail 
(fig. 2). This fastening was very strong and proved a great 
improvement. 

The next change was the use of cast-iron chairs to support the 
rails, which were introduced by Kincaid in 1872. These led to a 
modification of the rail section, and instead of the two side 
flanges a rail with a central flange (fig. 3) which fitted into the 
cast-iron chairs was used. The chairs weighed about 75 lb 
each, and were spaced at intervals of about 3 ft. The Barker 
rail laid in Manchester in 1877 was somewhat similar to that 
shown in fig. 3, but a continuous cast-iron chair was used to 
support it. 

The introduction of steam traction about 1880, with its heavier 
axle loads and higher speeds, was a severe test of the permanent 
way. The flat section laid on timher sleepers and the built-up 
rails of the Kincaid and Barker types began to be discarded in 
favour of the solid girder rail rolled in one piece. The solidity 
and depth of this section gave it great vertical stiffness, and 
its introduction materially assisted in solving the problem of 
providing a smooth and serviceable joint. 

The merits of the girder rail soon caused it to be generally 
adopted, and although the design has heen greatly improved it 
remains to-day the standard form of tramway rail used through- 
out the world. At first difficulty was experienced in rolling the 
heavier sections with thin webs and wide bases, but the introduc- 
tion of steel and improvements in the rolling mills overcame these 
troubles. The early girder rails laid about 1880 usually weighed 
from 70 to 80 lb per lineal yard, and were 6 or 6\ in. deep. The 
groove varied from 1 to i\ in., and the tread was about 1 \ in. in 
width. The fish-plates were not designed to give any vertical 
support, and were merely used to keep the rail ends in line. The 
girder rails were either bedded directly on the foundation or 
spiked to timber sleepers which were buried in the concrete. 

The form of head adopted for tramway rails in Europe has 
almost universally been one with the groove on one side. With 
this section the wheel flange forces out the dirt clear of the tread. 
In a few isolated cases a centre grooved rail has been used. As 
with railways, the adoption of many different gauges has led to 
much inconvenience. This want of uniformity in the gauge is 
in some parts of the country a great obstacle to the construction 
of inter-urban lines. London and the larger provincial towns 



adopted the standard gauge of 4 ft. 2>\ in., but in many towns 
narrow gauges of 3 ft. or 3 ft. 6 in. were laid. Glasgow and a 
few other towns adopted the gauge of 4 ft. 7 J in. with a view of 
making the narrow grooved rail of the tramways available for 
railway wagons, but without any real success. 

With the introduction of electric traction the weight and 
speed of the cars greatly increased, and experience soon proved 
that only the most substantial form of permanent way was 
capable of withstanding the wear and tear of the traffic. The 
early electric lines were laid with girder rails weighing about 
75 lb per lineal yard. These proved to be too light, and, at the 
present time, rails weighing from 95 to no lb per lineal yard 
are in general use. The large number of rail sections designed 
a few years ago gave considerable trouble to makers of rails. 
The issue in 1903 by the Engineering Standards Committee 
of a set of standard girder tramway rail sections was there- 
fore generally welcomed. The sections comprise rails of five 
different weights. Modified sections for use on curves were also 
published, together with a standard form of specification. Fig. 4 
shows the section of the 100 lb. B.S. rail (No. 3). 

Tramway rails are generally ordered in 45 ft. lengths. Rails 
60 ft. long are sometimes used, but they are difficult to handle, 
especially in narrow streets. The rail joints still prove the weakest 
part of the track. Numerous patents have been taken out for fish- 
plates and sole-plates of special design, but none has proved quite 
satisfactory. The " Dicker " joint, in which the head of the rail on the

tread side is partly cut away and the fish-plate carried up so that 
the wheel runson its top edge, and the " anchor " joint, in which a 
short piece of inverted rail is bolted or riveted to the undersides of 
the abutting rails, have been largely used. The latter makes a good 
stiff joint, but when buried in concrete it interferes with the bedding 
of the rail as a whole, often causing it to work loose in the centre. 
Various processes have also been introduced for uniting the ends of 
the rails by welding. Electric welding was first tried in the United 
States about 1893, and has since been considerably used in that 
country. In this process two specially prepared fish-plates are 
applied, one to each side of the joint. Each fish-plate has three 
bosses or projections, one in the centre opposite the joint and one 
near each end. By passing a heavy alternating current of low 
voltage between the opposite bosses the fish-plates are welded to 
the rail. The current is obtained from the line by means of a motor- 
generator and static transformer. Another process which has been 
used considerably in the United States, and at Coventry and Norwich 
in England, is the east-welded joint. To make this joint the rail 
ends are enclosed in an iron mould filled with molten cast-iron, 
which makes a more or less perfect union with the steel rails. The 



TRAMWAY

great drawback to these two processes is the costly and cumbersome 
apparatus required. Jhe " thermit " process (see Welding) does 
not require any large initial outlay, and has been applied to welding 
the joints on both old and new tracks. The cost of making each 
joint is about £i. 

Points and crossings are used on a tramway to deflect a car from 
one road to another. In the days of horse^ traction no movable 
switch was used, the car being guided by making thehorses pull the 
leading wheels in the required direction. With the introduction of 
mechanical traction a movable switch was fitted in one of the cast- 
ings to act as a guide to the wheel flanges. On modern tramways the 
points consist of a pair of steely castings, one bein^ a fixed or dummy 
point, and the other containing a movable^ switch. On a single 
track at passing places the cars in Great Britain always take the left- 
hand road,and a spring is fitted to hold the movable switch to lead in 
that direction. The bottom of the grooves at open points and cross- 
ings are raised so that the car wheel runs on its flange over the break 
in the tread of the rail. Double switch points in which the two 
tongues are connected are sometimes laid. In recent years the size 
and weight of the castings and the length of the movable switches 
have considerably increased.^ Manganese steel is very generally used 
for the tongues and sometimes for the whole casting. Ordinary 
cast steel with manganese steel inset piecesat the parts which wear 
most quickly are a feature of the later designs. At some junctions 
the points are moved by electric power. 

While the form of concrete foundation remains the same as that 
laid at Liverpool in 1868, far greater care is now given to the bedding 
of the rails. After the excavation has been completed the rails 
are set up in the trench and carefully packed up to the finished level. 
The concrete is then laid and packed under the rail, generally for 
a depth of 6 in. When the surface is to be paved with stone setts 
bedded on sand the concrete may be left rough, but where wood is 
to be laid the surface must be floated with fine mortar and finished 
to a smooth surface. Both hard and soft wood blocks are used for 
paving. Wood should not be used unless the whole width of the 
carriage-way is paved. Many different qualities of stone setts have 
been laid. Hard granite such as that supplied from the quarries 
near Aberdeen is the most suitable. 

In urban districts the road authorities almost always require 
the tramway surface, i.e. between the rails and for 18 in. on either 
side, to be paved. In country districts many tramways- have been 
laid with only a sett edging along each rail, the remainder of the 
surface being completed with either ordinary or tarred macadam. 
This construction, however, is only suitable on roads with very light 
traffic. After a tramway is laid, especially in a macadamized road, 
the heavy vehicular traffic use the track, and the wear is very much 
greater than on other parts of the carriage-way. 

Steam and Cable Tramways. — Horse traction, especially in 
hilly districts, has many limitations, and early in the history of 
tramways experiments were made both with steam cars and cable 
haulage. Although experimental steam cars were tried in 
England in 1873 the first tramways which regularly employed 
steam engines were French, though the engines were supplied 
by an English firm. About 1880 many improvements were 
made in the design of the engines employed, and this form of 
traction was adopted on several tramways in England. Beyond 



formed of concrete, with cast-iron yokes spaced at intervals of 
4 ft. to support the slot beams. The conduit was 19 in. deep by 
9 in. wide. The slot was £ in. wide. The running rails were 
of the ordinary girder type bedded in concrete. Fig. 5 shows a 
cross-section of the track at a yoke. This form of construction 
is very similar to that employed in forming the tube on a modern 
electric conduit tramway. At Edinburgh and other places where 
a shallow conduit is used the supporting pulleys are placed in 
pits sunk below the general level of the tube. On the Birming- 
ham cable tramway, where the tube is 2 ft. 8 in. deep, pits are not 
required at the supporting pulleys. This reduces the difficulty of 
draining the conduit. The yokes in this case are made of steel 
T-bars spaced 4 ft. apart. 

Electric Tramways. — Electricity is now the standard motive 
power for tramway service, and is applied in three main ways: 
(1) the overhead or trolley system; (2) the open conduit system; 
and (3) the surface contact or closed conduit system. (See also 
Traction.) 

On a tramway worked on the overhead principle current is supplied 
to the cars by two overhead conductors or wires. Round copper 
wires varying in size from o (0*324 in.) to 0000 (0-40 in.) 
S.W. gauge are generally used. With feeding points 2Tfl? e * d 
at every mile, the o wire is electrically sufficient on most TroU0 y* 
roads, but from a mechanical point of view 00 wire is the smallest 
it is desirable to erect. Wires having figure 8 or elliptical grooved 
sections have been employed, and have the advantage of allowing 
the use of a mechanical clip ear which is clear of the trolley wheel. 
The ordinary round wire is usually supported by a ^un-metal or 
gun-metal and iron ear grooyedto fit the wire, which is soldered or 
sweated to it. In Great Britain the overhead conductors are re- 
quiredby the board of trade to be divided into half-mile sections. 
The wires on adjoining sections are connected by section insulators. 
These consist of gun-metal castings in two parts, insulated from 
each other. The line wires are clamped to the metal ends. The 
continuity of the path of the trolley wheel is provided for on the 
underside of the^ insulator by fixing a > hardwood strip between the 
ends or by the ribs on the castings with air gaps. 

The trolley wires are supported by ears either from span wires 
which extend across the roadway between two poles or from bracket 
arms carried on a pole on one side only of the road. The span wires 
and short bracket suspension wires are also insulated, so that there 
is double insulation between the conductor and the pole. The 
overhead conductors are usually hung about 21 ft. above the rails. 
(For catenary suspensions see traction.) The poles which carry 
the span wires and the bracket arms are placed not more than 
40 yds. apart and are generally placed at the edge of the kerb. They 
are built up of three sections of steel tubes, one overlapping the 
other; the^ joints are shrunk together while hot. A cast-iron case 
is^ used to improve the appearance of the pole, and cast-iron collars 
hide the joints. _ Standard specifications for poles have been issued 
by the Engineering Standards Committee. 

When permission can be obtained the span wires are sometimes 
supported by rosettes attached to the walls of the houses on either 
side of the street. This method has been largely adopted in Germany,

requiring a better constructed track it does not necessitate any 
modifications in the general design of the permanent way. The 
first cable tramway was constructed at San Francisco in 1873. 
In England the first cable system was a short length at Highgate 
in 1884. Cable tramways were also laid down at Edinburgh 7 
Birmingham, Matlock and Brixton (London). Cable traction, 
with the expensive track construction it necessitates, and the 
limited speed of haulage, belongs to the past. Only gradients 
too severe to be worked by ordinary adhesion will in the future 
justify its use. *The construction of the conduit or tube in 
which the cable runs adds very considerably to the cost of the 
permanent way. On the Edinburgh system the conduit was 
xxvn. 6 



and by dispensing with the poles in the roadway it improves the 
appearance of the street. 

Overhead conductors will not be tolerated in some cities, and to 
avoid the use of them open conduit and surface contact tramways 
have been introduced. In the conduit system the 
conductors are carried in a conduit or tube beneath the ® pe tt 
surface of the track, and the electric current is picked up ^o^outu 
by means of a plough carried by the cars. Modern conduit tramways 
are divided into two kinds: those which have the conduit at the side 
under one running rail, and those which have it under the centre of 
the track. The only example of the former to be found in England 
is at Bournemouth, but it is used at Vienna, Brussels, Paris, Berlin 
and Budapest. Centre conduit construction has been adopted in 
London, Nice, Bordeaux, New York, Washington, &c. The advan- 
tages of the side slot system are the reduction in the amount of metal

in the roadway, less breaking up of the pavement, and slightly 
cheaper cost of construction. Its chief disadvantage is the difficulty 
it introduces in connexion with points and crossings. It is also 
objected that if the side slot is made the same width as the rail groove

it becomes a danger to narrow-tired vehicles. The difficulty in regard 
to points and crossings is overcome by bringing the slot into the 
centre of the track at junctions and turn-outs. Fig. 6 shows a

Fig. 7. — Section of Centre Conduit (London County Council type), 
the slot is 1 in., which is the least width possible. In London fin. was 
first adopted as the width of the centre slot, but later this was increased 
to 1 in., so that in this particular there is not much to 
choose between the two systems. Fig. 7 shows a 
section of the London County Council track at one 
of the cast-iron yokes. These are spaced 3 ft. 9 in. 
apart, every second yoke being now continued out 
under the running rail which is fastened to it. There 
is no doubt that the extended yoke greatly increases 
the strength of the track. The slot beams weigh 60 lb 
per yard. The conductor bars are of mild steel, 
T-shaped. They weigh 22 lb per yard and are sup- 
ported on insulators at intervals of 15 ft.^ Each in- 
sulator is covered over in the roadway with a cast- 
iron frame and movable lid.^ There are two conductor 
rails — positive and negative — so that the whole 
circuit is insulated from earth. The conduit or tube 
is formed of cement concrete. The track between 
the rails is paved with granite setts in order that 
there may be no trouble with w<)od blocks swelling 
and closing the slot. 

American practice in conduit construction has 
become fairly well standardized (fig. 8). The con- 
duit is oval in shape, its major axis being vertical, 
and is formed of concrete. An excavation about 
30 in. deep and 5 ft. wide is made, and in this are 
laid cast-iron yokes weighing 410 lb each, and 
spaced 5 ft. apart centre to centre. Every third 
yoke contains bearings for a hand-hole plate, and 
weighs about 600 lb. These yokes surround the 
conduit proper and are provided with extensions 
on each side for the attachment of the rails. In 
the older construction the rails were laid directly 
upon the iron of the yokes, steel wedges and shims 
being used under them for the final alinement of the 
rails. In the more recent construction, on the Third 
Avenue railroad in New York^ City, a wooden 
stringer, 6 in. by 4$ in. in size, is laid along from yoke 
to yoke on the bearing surfaces, and the rail laid 
upon this. The rail is held down on the yoke by 
means of two bolts at each bearing-point, these bolts 
having turned-up heads which embracethe foot of 
the rail. The slot rails, or Z bars forming the two 
jaws of the f in. slot, are bolted to the upper part of 
the yokes. The weights of the metal used per linear 



yard of construction of this type are: castiron, including both types 
of yokes, 500 lb; track rails, 214 lb; slot rails, 116 lb; conductor rails, 
42 lb; and conduit plate, 16 lb — nearly 400 lb of rolled steel per yard. 
After the rails, which are of a high girder type, are fastened in place 
thin plates of sheet steel are bent into the oval holes in the yokes 
extending from yoke to yoke, and form the inner surface of the 
completed conduit. Around this is carefully laid a shell, 4 in. thick, 
of Portland cement concrete. -The yokes are furnished with lugs 
which serve to retain, temporarily, wooden boards forming a mould 
in which the concrete is rammed. Sectional wooden shapes serve 
to hold the thin steel lining in place while the concrete is hardening. 
Around this concrete tube, and on each side of it, to form a basis 
for the street pavement, is laid a mass of coarser concrete. In each 
side of the special yokes is placed an insulator of porcelain, protected 
by a cast-iron shell and carrying a support for the conductor rail, 
which is of T-shaped steel, weighing 21 lb per yard. It is in 30 ft. 
lengths and is supported every 15 ft. by the insulators, the ends of 
separate rails being matched at and held by an insulator support. 
This rail is, of course, bonded with copper bonds. Two such con-

ductor rails arc installed in the conduit 6 in. apart, the flat faces 
.corresponding to the upper surface of the T being placed towards 
each other. Elaborate provisions for drainage and inspection are 
also provided, depending upon the situation of the tracks and nature 
of the street. The current is fed to the conductor rails by heavy 
copper conductors of from 500,000 to 1 ,000,000 circular mils cross- 
section, insulated and lead-covered, laid in ducts alongside of or 
between the two tracks of double-track systems. Connexion is

made between the cars and the conductor rails by means of a 
*' plough," carried by a hard steel plate, which is channelled to re- 
ceive the insulated wires leading up to the controller on the car. The 
plough carries two cast-iron rubbing-blocks, which are pressed out- 
ward into contact with the conductor rails by springs, the two being, 
of course, very carefully insulated from each other and from the other 
metal-work of the plough. It has been found expedient in practice 
to reverse the polarity^ of the current used on these conduit roads 
from time to time, since electrolytic deposits, formed by small 
leakage currents in the vicinity of insulators, &c, are thus dissolved 
before they become a source of trouble. 

Great difficulty is experienced with all conduits in keeping them 
clean and free from water. On the London tramways a sump has 
been formed at intervals of about 60 yds. into which the conduit 
drains. These sumps are connected with the sewers. The principal 
objection to the conduit system is its heavy first cost. The tracks 
alone in London are estimated to cost about £13,000 per mile of 
single track against about £8000 per mile for a track to be worked 
on the overhead system. 

This high cost of ^ construction has caused considerable attention 
to be directed by inventors to devising surface contact systems. 
Many of the designs which have been patented 
appear excellent in theory, but have been found un- 
trustworthy under working conditions. Among those 
worked commercially in England are (1) the Lorain system in opera- 
tion at Wolverhampton; (2) the Dolter system at Torquay, Hastings 
and Mexborough, and (3) the G.B. system at Lincoln. Of all these 
systems current is supplied from iron studs laid in the roadway be- 
tween the rails of the track to a skate carried on the car. The studs are 
placed 10 ft. to 15 ft. apart and contain a movable switch or contact, 
which is operated by the influence of a magnet carried under the car. 
In the Lorain system (fig. 9) connexion is made to the source of 
power through two carbon contact pieces. The lower carbon 
contact is carried on a soft iron strip which is connected to the supply 
cable by means of a flat copper ribbon spring. When the magnet 
passes from over a stud the iron armature and the lower carbon 
contact, which has been magnetically attracted, falls vertically, 
assisted by the copper ribbon spring. In the^ Dolter system the 
contact box (fig. 10) contains a bell crank lever with a carbon contact 
at its lower end. The upper arm of this lever is of soft iron, which 
is attracted by the magnet carried under the car. When the lever 
is moved the carbon block at the lower end is brought into contact 
with the fixed carbon contact in the side of the box which is perma- 
nently connected to the supply cable. In the G.B. contact box 
(fig. ti) contact is made direct to a bare feeder cable carried in a pipe

under the boxes. The switch, consisting of a piece of galvanized 
iron, is suspended freely by means of an insulated phosphor bronze 
spring. At the lower end of this moving piece a carbon contact 
piece is attached. When the magnet carried by the car passes over 
a stud, the moving piece is magnetically attracted to the cable 
against the pull of the spring. In the Lorain and the Dolter systems 
the studs are raised slightly above the road surface — which is an 



objectionable feature — and the current is collected by a skate, 
suspended under the car, touching the projecting surface. In the 
G.B. system the stud heads are kept flush with the pavement, and 
the collector consists of iron links spring suspended. As the collector 
passes over the box the links are magnetically attracted, and move 
down, making contact with the stud. 

1 n all surface contact systems, short circuiting devices are provided 
to detect any studs which may remain live after the skate has passed, 
either by blowing a fuse or by ringing a bell, but it is questionable 
how much reliance can be placed on 
their efficiency under all conditions. 
The collecting skate and magnets 
carried by the cars on a surface, con- 
tact tramway are of considerable 
weight, and the skate requires re- 
newal at frequent intervals. 

An efficient system of street 
traction may be defined as one 
which, while giving a reasonable 
return on the capital invested, 
provides the public, without dis- 
figurement of the highway, with 
a quick and frequent service of 
comfortable cars. 

When tramways were first intro- 
duced the surface of the streets 
was often exceedingly rough. The 
tramcar running on rails was there- 
fore a great advance in comfort 
of travelling on the old stage 
carriage. Horse traction, however, 
limited the weight of the car and 
the speed of travelling. The sub- 
stitution of steam traction for horse traction was a great 
advance. Higher speeds and quicker acceleration 
were obtained, and larger and more comfortable cars ^^"^* 
could be worked. The power, however, was limited y SystemSt 
and the locomotives, built as light as possible, were 
expensive in first cost and maintenance. Cable traction, owing 
to the heavy first cost of the track, requires a great 
density of traffic to make it pay. The speed is limited 
both up and down hill to that of the cable. It has the 
advantage that it can be safely worked on severe 
gradients, and once installed the working costs are low. 

Electric traction by accumulator cars was tried in 
Birmingham in 1890 and abandoned after some years of 
unsatisfactory working. The cars were costly to work 
and maintain. The storage batteries had to be re- 
charged at frequent intervals, and they rapidly dropped 
in capacity. There was little reserve of power, and 
the cells added considerably to the weight of the car. 

Those forms of electric traction in which the power is 
supplied to the cars from an outside source have many 
advantages. Only the weight of the motors has to be 
carried. These are efficient over a wide range of speed, 
accelerate quickly, have a large reserve of power and 
are clean and silent. The electric conduit and surface 
contact tramways do not require any disfiguring over- 
head wires. They have, however, troubles of their own. 
The construction of the electric conduit is so expensive 
that its choice must necessarily be limited to large 
cities. The conductors are easily short-circuited. Gaps 
in the conductors must be left at the points and crossings. 
The cost of keeping the conduit clean is considerable. 
It has the advantage, however, of having both the posi- 
tive and negative conductors insulated. Surf ace contact 
systems require studs or contact boxes to be placed 
in the road. In most systems these project above the 
surface of the street. The switches, which they contain 
are hidden away from inspection. A failure of insulation or the 
sticking of a switch may allow a live stud to be unprotected 
in the roadway. The weight of the car and consequently the 
power required to move it is considerably increased by the skate, 
magnet and battery which have to be carried. 

For simplicity of working the overhead system easily comes

first. The conductors are out of reach, they can easily be 
doubly or trebly insulated, and with their insulators are open to 
inspection. The poles and wiring can be erected without closing 
or obstructing the street. The supply of power is not interfered 
with by heavy rain, snow or other climatic causes. Duplicate 
conductors are used, and repairs can be rapidly executed. The 
only objection is that of unsightliness, which, however, can be 
greatly reduced by good design. 

The cost of establishing tramways to be worked on the various 
systems of traction mentioned above has varied considerably. The 
locality and the amount of street widening have considerable 
influence on the total. Horse tramways in the larger cities cost in 
the past about £15,000* per track mile complete with horses, cars, 
&c., tramways worked by steam power about £1 8,000 2 per track 
mile including locomotives and cars. The Edinburgh Corporation 
cable tramways cost £23,316* to establish complete with power- 
house, cars, &c. Of this figure, the cost of the permanent way 
construction amounted to £14,4.31.' The construction and equipment 
of the South London conduit tramways cost £25,106* per mile 
of singleline; the permanent way, its electrical equipment and the 
distributing cables cost £15,895* per track mile. More recent 
estimates appear to show that the average cost in London will be 
between £26,000 and £30,000 per track mile. In Glasgow the total 
cost of constructing and equipping the electric tramways on the 
overhead system, including the provision of a power station, cost 
£19,787* per track mile, and at Leeds £13,206. At Manchester, 
where current is provided by the lighting station, the complete cost 
works out at £12,498.* The cost of the permanent way, cables 
and electrical equipment per track mile vanes from ^£6575 at Man- 
chester to £9959 at Glasgow. The cost of laying down a surface 
contact electric tramway is about slightly more than that of con- 
structing and equipping a track with overhead conductors. The 
cost of the permanent way and its electrical equipment together with 
the cables at Wolverhampton on the Lorain surface contact principle 
amounted to £8601 per track mile. 

The working expenses of the various systems of traction are largely 
affected by the age of the tramway, the locality, and, in the case of 
electric lines, by the cost at which power is obtained. 1 n Birmingham 
in 1890-1891 6 horse traction cost 9*79d. per car mile, steam traction 
io-o^d. per mile, cable traction 6«33d. and electric accumulator 
traction 9*9od. per car mile. Modern electric trolley lines generating 
their own current work at from 5d. to 6d. per car mile. Where current 
is purchased the costs vary from 6d. to 7£d. per car mile. The 
working costs of the London County Council conduit tramways 
worked on purchased current amounted to 8*02d. per car mile in 
the year 1905-1906. 

Tramway Cars. — The modern tramway car is made up of two 
distinct parts, the body and the truck. The" present type of 
double ended car with a platform at each end was first used 
on the American street railways about i860. The car body was 
supported directly on axle-boxes through helical steel or rubber 
springs. 

When the early pioneers were experimenting in the United 
States with electric traction they attached the motor to the car 
body. This proved unsatisfactory, and resulted in the develop- 
ment of the modern truck. The truck may be described as a 
carriage or frame supported on the axle-boxes by springs and 
supporting by another set of springs the car body. The truck 
carries the motors and in itself resists all the strains of the 
driving mechanism. 

Modern car bodies are mounted either on a single four-wheeled 
truck, with a fixed or rigid wheel-base, or on two four-wheeled 
bogies or swivelling trucks. Four-wheeled radial trucks have 
been tried on several tramways, but they have not proved satis- 
factory. The wheel-base of the fixed or rigid truck usually 
varies from 6 to 7 ft. The length of the wheel-base should be 
determined by the radius of the sharpest curve. To obtain 
steady running it should be made as long as possible. Two 
motors are generally fitted on a car. 

Of the bogie or swivelling trucks the greater number now in use 
are of the " maximum traction " type. This truck is used to obtain 
the greatest tractive effect from two motors when fitted to a car 
supported on eight wheels. Each bogie is a small four-wheeled

truck in itself. It has one pair of its wheels driven by the' single 
motor and of the standard size — about 30 in. — while the guiding 
or " pony " wheels are of small diameter. The weight of the car 
body is supported eccentrically on the truck, so that about 70 % to 
80% is available for adhesion under the driving-wheels. While 
this form of truck has many merits, it also has many disadvantages. 
The^ small wheels easily leave the rails, while the adhesion of the 
driving-wheels compared with a four-wheeled car is considerably 
reduced. Quick acceleration is difficult, and on a greasy rail much 
energy is lost in slipping. The use of equal-wheeled bogies with a 
motor on every; axle gets over the difficulty of the loss of adhesion 
but at a greatly increased cost. The current consumption is increased, 
the first cost is greater, and there are four instead of two motors 
to be maintained. Steel-tired wheels have largely replaced the cast- 
iron chilled wheel for many years used on tramcars. 

While the various forms of trucks are common both to British 
and American practice, car body construction differs in many points. 
The single-deck car is universal outside the United Kingdom, 
where, although many single-deck cars are worked, the greater 
number are of the double-deck type. It is claimed that with small 
single-deck cars a quicker service can be maintained, as they are 
easier to load and unload and generally handier. On the other hand, 
the double-deck car seats more than double the number of passen- 
gers, requires the same number of men to work it, and takes but little 
more power to drive it. Experience has proved that the 58-passenger 
— 28 inside and 30 outside — double-deck car mounted on a four- 
wheeled truck is the type of rolling stock most suitable for British 
conditions. For heavy rush traffic or long distance travel the larger 
bogie cars are convenient. They are, however, slow to start and 
stop, and a 72-passenger car is too much for one conductor to work 
efficiently.^ Another difference is due to the width of the cars. 
In the United States car bodies vary from 8 ft. to 9 ft. 6 in. in width. 
In Great Britain the width is limited by the Tramways Act of 1870 
to 1 1 in. beyond the outer edge of the wheels, which, on the standard 
gauge, allows the maximum width to be 6 ft. 10 in. This limit has 
governed the arrangement of the seating in the cars. Inside, the 
ordinary side seat is almost invariably adopted. Cross seats have been 
used, but they leave a very narrow gangway — a great disadvantage 
at times of overcrowding. On the top deck, where the available 
width is greater and standing is never permitted, cross seats are 
universally fitted. 

On the old horse cars a straight type of stairway was used. The 
reserved stairway, brought in about # 1902, gave greater protection 
from accident and increased the seating accommodation on the top 
deck. It had, however, two great disadvantages. The stairway 
shut out the motorman's view on the left-hand side, and the stream 
of passengers descending met the stream of passengers leaving the 
inside of the car, causing delay. The reversed type of stairway has 
now been abandoned and the straight type, well protected by 
railings, is usually fitted. 

In addition to the ordinary single-deck and double-deck types 
of cars which are in general use many other designs are to be found. 
Single-deck open cars of the" toast-rack " type with transverse 
seats are popular on many holiday lines. They have the advantage 
of being quickly^ filled and emptied. Centre vestibule cars are now 
seldom seen. It is inconvenient not to have the conductor at the back 
of the car where he can look out for passengers, and, if necessary, 
" nurse " the trolley. There is also danger of a passenger being 
struck by theaxle-boxes of the rear bogie truck when leaving the car. 
The Californian type of car body, with the central part closed in 
and one or two double-sided transverse seats at each end, has been 
used on routes where low bridges do not allow of the use of double- 
deck cars. The carrying capacity of this type in wet weather when 
the exposed seats cannot be used is small. A demi or one-man car 
has been worked in some towns. It saves the wages of one man, but 
the average speed of the service is reduced. Top deck covers have 
in recent years been largely fitted. Their use practically doubles 
the covered seating capacity of the car and provides accommodation 
for smokers, a difficult matter on a single-deck car. 

In Great Britain the board of trade requires all cars to be fitted 
with an efficient form of lifeguard. The gate and tray pattern, 
in which anything striking the vertical gate drops the tray, is 
that principally employed. In addition to the ordinary hand-brake 
which operates shoes on all. the wheels, and the electric reverse 
switch, a large number of cars are fitted with some form of electric 
brake (see Traction). 

Legislative Conditions in Great Britain. — The first tramways 
constructed in Great Britain were promoted by private enter- 
prise under powers conferred by private acts of parliament. 
Considerable opposition was offered to pioneer schemes, but after 
a few private acts had been passed, parliament, in 1870, passed a 
general act providing for the laying of rails upon roads, and specify- 
ing the procedure for tramway promotion and the main relations 
between tramway undertakers and local authorities. The 
Tramways Act 1870, which is still in force, enabled promoters to 
apply to the board of trade for a provisional order which, when 
confirmed by parliament, possesses all the force of an act of 



TRAMWAY

parliament. The procedure is therefore simpler and cheaper than 
private bill procedure. Under this act promoters are obliged 
to obtain, as a condition precedent to making application for a 
provisional order, the consent of local authorities in whose areas 
the proposed tramways are to run. This provision is referred 
to as the " veto clause." Where a line is laid in two or more 
districts and two-thirds of the line are in districts where the local 
authorities do consent, the board of trade may dispense with 
the consent of the remainder. When procedure by private bill 
is adopted a similar " veto " provision is made by Standing 
Order 22, which requires the consent of the local authority (and 
of the road authority where there is one distinct from the local 
authority) before the bill goes to first reading; in this case also 
the consent of authorities for two-thirds of a continuous line are 
deemed sufficient. The powers granted under the Tramways 
Act are in perpetuity, subject to the right of the local authorities 
(under the 43rd section) to purchase, at the end of twenty-one 
years or each septennial period following (or within three months 
after the promoters have discontinued working the tramway or 
have become insolvent), so much of the undertaking as lies within 
their areas, on paying the then value of the properties suitable to 
and used for the undertaking, exclusive of any allowance for past 
or future profits or compensation for compulsory sale or any 
other consideration whatsoever, such value to be determined by 
an arbitrator appointed by the board of trade. Another part 
of the arrangement specified hetween the local authorities and 
the undertakers is that the undertakers shall pave the tramway 
track between the outer rails and for 18 in. beyond each outer 
rail. Mr G. F. Shaw-Lefevre (afterwards Lord Eversley), when 
introducing the bill in 1870, said that it " would give powers to 
the local authorities to construct tramways, but not, of course, 
to work them." The idea apparently was that local authorities 
should retain full control of the roads by constructing the tram- 
ways, and would make arrangements with lessees on terms which 
would secure reasonable fares and other conditions for the benefit 
of the travelling public. It was not until 1896 that parliament 
permitted local authorities to work tramways as well as own them, 
except in cases where lessees could not be obtained. The 
precedents for municipal working were created by private acts 
at a time when public opinion was in favour of that policy; 
and after the first few bills for municipal tramway working had 
been successful, other municipalities found practically no diffi- 
culty in obtaining the desired powers, although parliament had 
never adequately discussed, as a specific reform, the departure 
from the principle laid down by Mr Shaw-Lefevre in 1870. The 
conditions in fact proved more favourable to municipal than 
company promoters, since the local authorities, as soon as they 
aspired to work tramways as well as own them, used the power of 
veto against the proposals of companies. 

The situation entered a more acute phase when electric 
traction was introduced on tramways. The Tramways Act 
provides, by section 34, that all carriages shall be moved by 
the power prescribed by the special acts or provisional order, 
and where no such power is prescribed, by animal power only. 
The mechanical power used must be by consent of the board of 
trade, and subject to board of trade regulations. Owing to 
the capital expenditure involved in electric traction, under- 
takings nearing the end of their twenty-one years' tenure found 
that it was not commercially feasible to carry out the change 
without an extension of tenure. The local authorities were 
reluctant to grant that extension, and they were also reluctant 
to give permission for the promotion of new lines. 

The difficulties of the altered conditions created by the advent 
of electric traction were met to some extent by the Light 
Railways Act 1896. This act contains no definition of a light 
railway, and it has been used largely for electric tramway 
purposes. Lord Morley, when piloting the bill through the Lords, 
said that " light railway " includes " not merely all tramways 
but any railway which the board of trade thinks may justly 
be brought within the scope." It certainly includes tramways 
in towns, and it might include large trunk lines throughout 
the country." Accordingly it has been used for the construction 



of many miles of tram lines on the public streets and also in some 
cases for extensions where the track .leaves the public road, 
and is laid on land purchased for the purpose. These tracks 
are generally constructed with grooved girder rails, having 
a wide groove and a high check, so that the shallow flanged 
tramcar wheels can run on them with safety at high speeds. 
The rails are laid on cross sleepers and ballasted in the ordinary 
railway fashion. Fencing is erected, but level-crossing gates 
are often omitted, and cattle guards only are used to prevent 
animals straying on the track. These sleeper tracks on private 
ground are cheap to maintain if well constructed in the first 
instance. Speeds of 20 to 25 m. an hour have been sanctioned 
on electric lines of this character, worked by ordinary tramway 
rolling stock. There is no purchase clause in the Light Railways 
Act, but arrangements for purchase of the undertaking were 
usually made with the local authorities and the terms embodied 
in the order. The act contains no veto clause, section 7 stating 
that the commissioners are to " satisfy themselves that all 
reasonable steps have been taken for consulting the local authori- 
ties, including road authorities, through whose areas the rail- 
way is intended to pass, and the owners and occupiers of the 
land it is proposed to take." The Light Railway Commissioners, 
however, have interpreted the act in the spirit of the Tramways 
Act, so that for all practical purposes the veto remains. The new 
act differed from the Tramways Act in providing for the com- 
pulsory purchase of land under the Lands Clauses Acts — the 
Tramways Act expressly stating that the promoters should not 
be empowered to acquire land otherwise than by agreement. 
The board of trade has held that the act does not apply to 
tramways wholly within one borough. County, borough and 
district councils as well as individuals and companies are 
empowered to promote and work light railways. 

The passing of the act gave a great impetus to the construction 
of tramways worked by electric traction. But owing to the 
practical retention of the veto, there was not so much progress 
as was anticipated. Another cause of restriction was section 9, 
sub-section 3, which provides that if the board of trade con- 
siders that " by reason of the magnitude of the proposed under- 
taking, or of the effect thereof on the undertaking of any railway 
company existing at the time, or for any other special reason 
relating to the undertaking, the proposals of the promoters 
ought to be submitted to parliament," they should not confirm 
the order. In many cases railway companies, by pleading the 
competitive influence of proposed tramways promoted under the 
Light Railways Act, were able to force the promoters to apply 
to parliament or to drop the scheme. The latter alternative 
was frequently adopted, owing to the costs of parliamentary 
procedure being too heavy for the undertaking. 

Commercial Results.— Interest in the commercial results of tram- 
way enterprisers practically limited to electric traction, since^ other 
forms of traction have^ been almost entirely superseded owing to 
their economical inferiority. The main advantages of electric 
traction over horse traction lie in the higher speed, greater carrying 
capacity of cars, and the saving in power over a system in which only 
a small proportion of the power source is available at one time. 
Steam, compressed air and gas traction possess the disadvantages 
that each car has to carry the dead weight of power-producing 
machinery capable of maintaining speed up to the maximum grade. 
Cable traction has the disadvantages that the speed of the cars is 
limited by the speedy of the cable, that the range and complexity of 
the system are restricted, and that construction is expensive. The 
electric system, in which power is generated at a central source 
and distributed to cars which take power in proportion to the work 
being done, possesses a higher degree of flexibility, convenience and 
economy than any other system. Electric tramways in Great 
Britain are mostly equipped on the overhead trolley system, though 
the conduit and the surface contact systems have been installed in 
a few instances. Roughly the capital expenditure required for the 
three systems is in proportion of 2, lj and 1, and both the conduit 
and the surface contact systems are more costly to maintain than 
the overhead system. A fourth system of electric traction, in which 
the cars are fitted with storage batteries charged at intervals, has 
been tried frequently and as frequently abandoned. The great 
weight of^ the batteries, the serious initial cost and high rate of 
deterioration prevented the attainment of financial success. 

The earliest development of electric road traction on a large scale 
took place in America and on the continent of Europe, and the

The estimates gave reason to expect that electric traction would 
mean cheaper fares and more frequent services at a higher speed, 
resulting in a considerable increase in traffic receipts per mile and 
a substantial reduction of working expenses. The result of pioneer 
undertakings in South Staffordshire, Bristol and Coventry supported 
this expectation. Later experience, however, showed that the 
estimates were too optimistic. Taking the actual figures realized 
for the undertakings included in the above tables, the capital 
expenditure per mile of single track was £12,000 and the working 
expenses per car mile 6-3d. The expectations as to gross revenue 
have been generally realized, but the increase in capital expenditure 
and working expenses over the estimates is typical of electric cram- 
ways in Great Britain. In the matter of wear and tear the estimates 
have also been too low. The reasons for the larger capital expendi- 
ture are (1) superior track construction, (2) more elaborate overhead 
equipment, (3) use of larger cars, (4) higher cost of road paving and 
other improvements imposed upon tramway undertakings. 

According to the official returns of tramways and light railways 
for the year 1905-1906, there were 312 tramway undertakings in 
the United Kingdom, and 175 of these belonged to local authorities. 
Out of the total of 1491 m. of line owned by local authorities, 1276 m. 
are worked by these authorities themselves, and the remaining 
215 m. by leasing companies. Local authorities working as well as 
owning their tramways^ made a net profit of £2,520,752, applying 
£663,336 to the reduction of tramway debt and £205,981 to the 
relief of rates, while carrying £623,617 to reserve and renewal 
funds. The following table summarizes the amounts expended by

The total expenditure on tramways and light railways (omitting 
railways — main, branch and suburban) was £15,195,993 in 1896 and 
£58,177,832 in 1906^ 

One effect of the increased cost of expenditure per mile of track 
is to discourage extensions of rural and inter-urban lines where the 
traffic is not heavy. ^ Proposals have been made to adopt the " rail- 
less trolley " (used in some places on the continent of Europe) for 
such extensions. In this system the cars run on ordinary wheels 
and take power from overhead trolley wires. But so far no such 
arrangement has been put into practice in Great Britain, and out- 
lying districts are generally dealt with by petrol or steam motor 
vehicles, running as feeders to the tramways and railways. The future 
commercial development of tramways lies more in the economics in 
working than in growth of track mileage. Owing to the enormous 
volume of traffic a very slight alteration in one of the items of 
expense or revenue produces a large result in the aggregate. The 
addition of §d. per car mile to revenue or a corresponding reduction 
in expenses would, on the 240 millions of car miles run in 1905-1906, 
result in a gain of about £500,000 per annum, which is equal to 
nearly 1 % on the entire capital expenditure in respect of tramways 
and light railways. The tables given above show that the yield 
upon the capital invested in electric traction is not high. The effect 
of increased capital expenditure has been accentuated by reductions 
in fares. In 1886 the average fare per passenger was i-6id. and in 
1896 it was i*3id., falling in 1906 as low as i-iod. Some systems' 
carry passengers over 2$ m. for one penny, workmen being carried 
twice the distance for the same sum. Halfpenny fares are repre- 
sented as a boon to the working man, but they have been abandoned 
as a failure after several years' trial on several systems, and in 
Glasgow it is found that halfpenny fares contribute only 20-4% of 
the early morning traffic, while the penny fare contributes 72-3% 
of that traffic. The general manager of the Birmingham Corporation, 
tramways reported against halfpenny fares on the basis of his ex-' 
perience as general manager of the London County Council tramways 
that all the halfpenny passengers there are carried at a loss. The 
adjustment of faresand stages to their proper value is a question 
now carefully studied by tramway managers along with many 
problems of economy in working. The close adjustment of the 
service to the fluctuations in traffic is one source of economy which is 
being more seriously considered. Many systems have adopted 
top covers to cars in order to carry more passengers during wet 
weather. The adoption of these covers is not popular in fine weather ; 
it adds to the weight and wind-resistance of the cars, thus increasing 
current consumption, and it adds to the cost of construction and 
maintenance. Economy in electrical energy is, in its broader 
aspects, secured by purchasing current from an outside source in 
preference to generating it at a special station. The average cost 
per unit of electricity for all tramway undertakings in the United 
Kingdom is i*o6d., but one tramway company which purchases its 
energy from a large power company pays only o-85d. per unit. 
In its narrower aspects economy in current may be secured by 
reducing waste car mileage — that is to say, eliminating the running 
of cars at times and places where they are not required for an 
adequate service. Saving may also be effected by supervision of the 
driving of the cars, since the difference of as much as 20% has been 
noted between different drivers. One tramway manager secured 

substantial improvement by 
merely marking on the trolley 
standards the position which 
the controller handle should 
occupy in passing each point. 
The limitation of stops is an- 
other source of economy, the 
average cost per stop on a system 
having been found to be 0-17 d. 
A slight increase in the maxi- 
mum speed of tramcars would

also improve the net results by reducing the proportion of standing 
charges (wages, &c) to the traffic capacity of the system without 
making the cost of maintenance or current more than slightly greater. 
A 15% increase in average speed means a saving of id. per car mile. 
The development of parcels traffic is a source of revenue, and addi- 
tional receipts can be earned by 
the hiring-out of cars for picnics 
and other special purposes. An 
important point is the proper 
selection of the size of car. A 
small four-wheeled car is suitable 
to continual traffic of compara- 
tively small volume, but when 
the traffic is heavy cars of larger 
capacity are advisable.^ A serious 
burden on tramways is the cost 



The following table gives a few totals, ratios, and percentages 
for the last two years of what may be called a period of electric 
traction, in comparison with a typical " steam" period (i.e. a period

of insurance against accidents, although the number of serious 
accidents on electric tramways is exceedingly small in proportion to 
the number of passengers carried, the ratio of tramway accidents of 
all kinds being about one accident to every 15,000 passengers. 

There are many adjoining towns having separate tramway under- 
takings which do not provide intercommunication. Experience 
has shown that a break of tramway facilities reduces the receipts 
by 20 to 50 % on the lines which have been severed ; and the terminal 
half-mile, except in populous districts, is the least remunerative 
section of a tramway route. 

Statistics. — Each year the British board^ of trade issues a return 
of street and road tramways and light railways authorized by act 



From the above figures it will be noticed that the capital cost 
per mile has increased as a result of the adoption of electric traction, 
while at the same time the percentage of the return on the capital 
has been reduced notwithstanding that the rate of working expendi- 
ture has fallen and the number of passengers carried per mile has 
increased, the fares charged having been disproportionately reduced. 

(E. Ga.) 

TRANCE (through the French, from Lat. fransitus, from 
transire, to cross, pass over), a term used very loosely in popular 
speech to denote any kind of sleeplike state that seems to pre- 
sent obvious differences from normal sleep; in medical and scien- 



or order, showing the amount of^capital authorized, paid up and \ tific literature the meaning is but little better defined. In its 

original usage the word no doubt implied that the soul of the 
entranced person was temporarily withdrawn or passed away 
from the body, in accordance with the belief almost universally 
held by uncultured peoples in the possibility of such withdrawal. 
But the word is now commonly applied to a variety of sleeplike 
states without the implication of this theory; ordinary sleep* 
walking, extreme cases of melancholic lethargy and of anergic 
stupor, the deeper stages of hypnosis (see Hypnotism), the 



expended; the length of line authorized and the length open for 
public traffic; the gross receipts, working expenditures, net receipts 
and appropriation of net receipts ; the number of passengers conveyed ; 
the number of miles run by cars and the quantity^ of electrical 
energy used; together with the number of horses, engines and cars 
in use. The return published in January 1009 deals with the figures 
for local authorities up to the 31st of March 1908 and for companies 
up to the 31st of December 1907. The following comparative table

state into which many of the mediums of modern spiritualistic 
seances seem to fall almost at will; all these are commonly 
spoken of as trance, or trance-like, states. There are no well- 
marked and characteristic physical symptoms of the trance 
state, though in many cases the pulse and respiration are slowed, 
and the reflexes diminished or abolished.. The common feature 
which more than any other determines the application of the 
name seems to be a relative or complete temporary indifference 
to impressions made on the sense-organs, while yet the entranced 
person gives evidence in one way or another, either by the 
expression of his features, his attitudes and movements, his 
speech, or by subsequent relation of his experiences, that his 



i68 



TRANCE 



condition is not one of simple quiescence or arrest of mental 
life, such as characterizes the state of normal deep sleep and 
the coma produced by defective cerebral circulation by toxic 
substances in the blood or by mechanical "violence done to 
the brain. 

If we refuse the name trance to ordinary sleep-walking, to 
normal dreaming, to catalepsy, to the hypnotic state and to 
stupor, there remain two different states that seem to have equal 
claims to the name; these may be called the ecstatic trance and 
the trance of mediumship respectively. 

The ecstatic trance is usually characterized by an outward 
appearance of rapt, generally joyful, contemplation; the sub- 
ject seems to lose touch for the time being with the world of 
things and persons about him, owing to the extreme concen- 
tration of his attention upon some image or train of imagery, 
which in most cases seems to assume an hallucinatory character 
(see Hallucination). In most cases, though not in all, the sub- 
ject remembers in returning to his normal state the nature of his 
ecstatic vision or other experience, of which a curiously frequent 
character is the radiance or sense of brilliant luminosity. 

In the mediumistic trance the subject generally seems to 
fall into a profound sleep and to retain, on returning to his 
normal condition, no memory of any experience during the 
period of the trance. But in spite of the seeming unconscious- 
ness of the subject, his movements, generally of speech or 
writing, express, either spontaneously or in response to verbal 
interrogation, intelligence and sometimes even great intel- 
lectual and emotional activity. In many cases the parts of the 
body not directly concerned in these expressions remain in a 
completely lethargic condition, the eyes being closed, the 
muscles of neck, trunk and limbs relaxed, and the breathing 
stertorous. 

Trances of these two types seem to have occurred sporadic- 
ally (occasionally almost epidemically) amongst almost all 
peoples in all ages. And everywhere popular thought has 
interpreted them in the same ways. In the ecstatic trance 
the soul is held to have transcended the bounds of space or 
time, and to have enjoyed a vision of some earthly event distant 
in space or time, or of some supernatural sphere or being. The 
mediumistic trance, on the other hand, popular thought in- 
terprets as due to the withdrawal of the soul from the body and 
the taking of its place, the taking possession of the body, by 
some other soul or spirit; for not infrequently the speech or 
writing produced by the organs of the entranced subject seems 
to be, or actually claims to be, the expression of a personality 
quite other than that of the sleeper. It is noteworthy that in 
almost all past ages the possessing spirit has been regarded in 
the great majority of cases as an evil and non-human spirit; 
whereas in modern times the possessing spirit has usually been 
regarded as, and often claims to be, the soul or spirit of some 
deceased human being. Modern science, in accordance with its 
materialistic and positive tendencies, has rejected these popular 
interpretations. It inclines to see in the ecstatic trance a 
case of hallucination induced by prolonged and intense occu- 
pation with some emotionally exciting idea, the whole mind 
becoming so concentrated upon some image in which the idea 
is bodied forth as to bring all other mental functions into abey- 
ance. The mediumistic trance it regards as a state similar to 
deep hypnosis, and seeks to explain it by the application of the 
notion of cerebral or mental dissociation in one or other of its 
many current forms; this assimilation finds strong support 
in the many points of resemblance between the deeper stages 
of hypnosis and the mediumistic trance, and in the fact that the 
artificially and deliberately induced state may be connected 
with the spontaneously occurring trance state by a series of 
states which form an insensible gradation between them. A 
striking feature of the mediumistic trance is the frequent 
occurrence of " automatic " speech and writing; and this 
feature especially may be regarded as warranting the appli- 
cation of the theory of mental dissociation for its explanation, 
for such automatic speech and writing are occasionally pro- 
duced by a considerable number of apparently healthy persons 



while in a waking condition which presents little or no other 
symptom of abnormality. In these cases the subject hears 
his own words, or sees the movement of his hand and his own 
hand writing, as he hears or sees those of another person, 
having no sense of initiating or controlling the movements and 
no anticipatory awareness of the thoughts expressed by the 
movements. When, as in the majority of cases, such move- 
ments merely give fragmentary expression to ideas or facts 
that have been assimilated by the subject at some earlier date, 
though perhaps seemingly completely forgotten by him, the 
theory of mental dissociation affords a plausible and moderately 
satisfactory explanation of the movements; it regards them as 
due to the control of ideas or memories which somehow have 
become detached or loosened from the main system of ideas 
and tendencies that make up the normal personality, and which 
operate in more or less complete detachment; and the application 
of the theory is in many cases further justified by the fact that 
the " dissociated " ideas and memories seem in some cases to 
become taken up again by, or reincorporated with, the normal 
personality. 

But in recent years a new interest has been given to the study 
of the mediumistic trance by careful investigations (made with a 
competence that commands respect) which tend to re-establish 
the old savage theory of possession, just when it seemed to have 
become merely an anthropological curiosity. These investiga- 
tions have been conducted for the most part by members of 
the Society for Psychical Research, and their most striking 
results have been obtained by the prolonged study of the 
automatic speech and writing of the American medium, Mrs 
Piper. In this case the medium passes into a trance state 
apparently at will, and during the trance the organs of speech 
or the hand usually express what purport to be messages from 
the spirits of. deceased relatives or friends of those who are 
present. A number of competent and highly critical observers 
have arrived at the conviction that these messages often com- 
prise statements of facts that could not have come to the know- 
ledge of the medium in any normal fashion; and those who are 
reluctant to accept the hypothesis of " possession " find that they 
can reject it only at the cost of assuming the operation of tele- 
pathy (q.v.) in an astonishing and unparalleled fashion. During 
1907-1908 the investigation was directed to the obtaining of 
communications which should not be explicable by the most 
extended use of the hypothesis of telepathic communication 
from the minds of living persons. The plan adopted was to 
seek for " cross-correspondences " between the communica- 
tions of the Piper " controls " and the automatic writings of 
several other persons which claimed to be directed by the same 
disembodied spirits; i.e. it was sought to find in the automatic 
writings of two or more individuals passages each of which in 
itself would be fragmentary and unintelligible, but which, taken 
in connexion with similar fragments contemporaneously pro- 
duced by another and distant writer, should form a significant 
whole; for it is argued that such passages would constitute 
irrefutable evidence of the operation of a third intelligence or 
personality distinct from that of either medium. The results 
published up to 1909 seem to show that this attempt met with 
striking success; and they constitute a body of evidence in 
favour of the hypothesis of possession which no impartial and 
unprejudiced mind can lightly set aside. Nevertheless, so 
long as it is possible to believe, as so many of the most competent 
workers in this field believe, that dissociated fragments of a 
personality may become synthesized to form a secondary and 
as it were parasitic personality capable of assuming temporary 
control of the organs of expression, and so long as we can set no 
limits to the scope of telepathic communication between 
embodied minds, [ it would seem wellnigh impossible, even 
by the aid of t!his novel and ingenious plan of investigation, 
to achieve completely convincing evidence in favour of the 
hypothesis of " possession."

TRANENT, a police burgh .of Haddingtonshire, Scotland. 
Pop. (1901), 2584. It lies 9J m. E. of Edinburgh by road and 
1 m, S.E. of Prestonpans station on the North British railway. 
The town possesses the oldest coal-mining charter (1202-12 18) 
in Great Britain, and the mines and quarries in the neighbour- 
hood provide the staple industry. A fragment of a parish 
church, said to have been built in the nth century, still stands. 
Of the palace of the Setons which stood in the parish there are 
no remains. It was demolished towards the close of the 18th 
century and a modern mansion was erected on its site. 

In the neighbouring village of Ormiston, in 1885, a granite obelisk 
was erected in memory of Robert Moffat (i795 -l88 3)».a native, the 
South African missionary and father-in-law of Livingstone. _ At 
Ormiston Hall, a seat of the marquess of Linlithgow, there is a 
yew tree, beneath which the reformer George Wishart (i5 1 3 -1 54 6 ) 
used to preach. Hard by is the village of Pencaitland, divided into 
an eastern and a western portion by the Tyne. The parish church 
in Easter Pencaitland probably dates from the 13th century. The 
aisle may belong to the original building, but the rest is of the 
1 6th century, excepting the small belfry of the 17th century. The 
old house of Pencaitland stands in the grounds of Winton Castle, 
which was erected by the 3rd earl of Winton in 1620 but forfeited 
by the 5th earl, who was involved in the Jacobite rising of 1715. 
Five miles south-east of Tranent is the village of Salton (or Saltown), 
where Gilbert Burnet, afterwards bishop of Salisbury, had his first 
charge (1665). At his death he bequeathed the parish 20,000 marks 
for the clothing and educating 01 poor children. He was tutor 
to Andrew Fletcher, who was born at Salton in 1655 and buried 
there in 1716. At Fletcher's instigation James Meikle, a neighbour- 
ing millwright, went to Holland to learn the construction of the 
iron-work of barley mills, and the mill which he erected at Salton 
after his return not only gave Salton barley a strong hold on the 
market, but was also for forty years the only mill of its kind in the 
British Isles. Meikle'sson Andrew (1719-1811), inventor of the 
threshing machine, carried on his trade of millwright at Houston 
Mill near Dunbar. Andrew Fletcher, also of Salton (1692-1766), 
nephew of the elder Andrew, became lord justice clerk in 1735 
under the style of Lord Milton. By hismother's energy the art of 
weaving and dressing holland linen was introduced into the village. 
She travelled in Holland with two skilled mechanics who contrived 
to learn the secrets of the craft. The British Linen Company 
laid down their first bleachficld at Salton under Lord Milton s 
patronage. Salton also lays claim to having been the birthplace of 
the poet William Dunbar. 

TRANI, a seaport and episcopal see of Apulia, Italy, on the 
Adriatic, in the province of Bari, and 26 m. by rail W.N.W. of 
that town, 23 ft. above sea-level. Pop. (1901), 34,688. Trani 
has lost its old Walls and bastions, but the 13th-century Gothic 
citadel is used as a prison. Some of the streets remain much as 
they were in the medieval period, and many of the houses dis- 
play more or less of Norman decoration. The cathedral (dedi- 
cated to St Nicholas the Pilgrim, a Greek assassinated at Trani 
in 1094 and canonized by Urban II.), on a raised open site near 
the sea, was consecrated, before its completion, in 1143; it is a 
basiUca with three apses, a large crypt and a lofty tower, the 
latter erected in 1 230-1 239 by the architect whose name appears 
on the ambo in the cathedral of Bitonto, Nicolaus Sacerdos. 
It has an arch under it, being supported partly on the side wall 
of the church, and partly on a massive' pillar. The arches of the 
Romanesque portal are beautifully ornamented, in a manner 
suggestive of Arab influence; the bronze doors, executed by 
Barisanus of Trani in 1175, rank among the best of their period 
in southern Italy. The capitals of the pillars in the crypt are 
fine examples of the Romanesque. The interior of the cathedral 
has been barbarously modernized, but the crypt is fine. Near 
the harbour is the Gothic palace of the doges of Venice, which 
is now used as a seminary. The church of the Ognissanti has 
a Romanesque relief of the Annunciation over the door. S. 
Giacomo and S. Francesco also have Romanesque facades and 
the latter and S. Andrea have " Byzantine " domes. The 
vicinity of Trani produces an excellent wine (Moscato di Trani) ; 



and its figs, oil, almonds and grain are also profitable articles of 
trade. 

Trani is the Turenum of the itineraries. It first became a 
flourishing place under the Normans and during the crusades, 
but attained the acme of its prosperity as a seat of trade with 
the East under the Angevin princes. The harbour, however, 
has lost its importance. 

TRANQUEBAR, a town of British India, in the Tanjore district 
of Madras, on the sea-coast, 18 m. N. of Negapatam. Pop. 
(1901), 13,142. A Danish factory was opened here as early 
as 1620. It was taken by the British in 1801, but restored in 
18 1 4, and finally purchased, with the other Danish settlements 
in India, in 1845. In Danish times Tranquebar was a busy 
port, but it lost its importance when the railway was opened 
to Negapatam. It was the first settlement of Protestant 
missionaries in India, founded by Ziegenbalg and Plutschau 
(Lutherans) in 1706; and there is still a Lutheran mission high 
school and mission press. 

TRANSBAIKALIA (sometimes also known as Dauria), a 
province of Eastern Siberia, lying E. of Lake Baikal, with the 
government of Irkutsk on the N.W. and N., the provinces of 
Amur and Manchuria on the E. and Mongolia on the S. Its 
area (232,846 sq. m.) is nearly as large as that of Austria- 
Hungary, but its population does not much exceed half a 
million. 

Transbaikalia forms an intermediate link between Siberia, Mon- 
golia and the northern Pacific littoral. The Yablonoi Mountains, 
which run north-east from the sources of the Kerulen to the bend 
of the Olekma in 56 N., divide the province into two quite distinct 
parts; to the west, the upper terrace of the high east Asian plateau, 
continued from the upper Selenga and the Yenisei (4000 to 5000 ft. 
high) towards the plateau of the Vitim (3500 to 4000 ft.); and to 
the east the lower terrace of the same plateau (2800 ft.), forming 
a continuation of the eastern Gobi. Beginning at Lake Baikal, a 
valley, deep and broad, penetrates the north-western border-ridge 
of the plateau, and runs eastward up the river Uda, with an im- 
perceptible gradient, like a gigantic railway cutting enclosed 
between two steep slopes, and it sends another branch south 
towards Kiakhta. After having served, through a succession of 
geological periods, as an outlet for the water and ice which 
accumulated on the plateau, it is now utilized for the two 
highways which lead from Lake Baikal across the plateau (3500- 
4000 ft.) to the Amur on the east and theChinese depression on the 
south. Elsewhere the high and massive border-ridge on the 
north-western edge of the plateau can be crossed only by difficult 
footpaths. The border-ridge just mentioned, gapped by the wide 
opening of the Selenga, runs from south-west to north-east under 
different names, being known as Khamar-daban (6900 ft.) south of 
Lake Baikal, and as the Barguzin Mountains (7000 to 8000 ft.) along 
the east bank of the Barguzin river, while farther north-east it has 
been described _ under the names of the South Muya and the 
Chara Mountains (6000 to "7000 ft.). Resting its south-east base 
on the plateau, it descends steeply on the north-west to 
the lake and to the broad picturesque valleys of the Barguzin, 
Muya and Chara. Thick forests of larch, fir and cedar clothe the 
ridge, whose dome-shaped rounded summits (goltsy) rise above the 
limits of tree vegetation, but do not reach the snow-line (here above 
10,000 ft.). The high plateau itself has the aspect of an undulating 
table-land, intersected by ranges, which rise some 1500 or 2000 ft. 
above its surface, and are separated by broad, flat, marshy valleys, 
traversed by sluggish meandering streams. The better drained 
valleys have fine meadow lands, while the hills are clothed with 
forests (almost exclusively of larch and birch). Numberless^ lakes 
and ponds occur along the river courses. Tunguses hunt in the 
forests and meadows, but permanent agricultural settlements are 
impossible, corn seldom ripening on account of the early frost. 
The lower parts of the broad, flat valley of the Jida have, however, 
a few Cossack settlements, and Mongolian shepherds inhabit the 
elevated grassy valleys about Lake Kosso-gol (5300 ft. above the 
sea). Quite different is the lower terrace of the plateau, occupied 
by the eastern Gobi and the Nerchinsk region, and separated from 
the upper terrace by the Yablonoi range. This last is the south- 
eastern border-ridge of the higher terrace. It rises to 8035 ft. 
in the Sokhondo peak, but elsewhere its dome-shaped summits do 
not exceed 5000 or 6000 ft. Numberless lakes, with flat undefined 
margins, feed streams which join the great north-going rivers or 
the Amur and the Pacific. Low hills rise above the edge of the 
plateau, but the slope is abrupt towards the south-east, where the 
foot-hills of the Yablonoi are nearly 1500 and 2000 ft. lower than 
on the north-west. Climate, flora and fauna change suddenly as 
soon as the Yablonoi has been crossed.^ The Siberian flora gives 
way to the Daurian flora, and this is in turn exchanged for the 
Pacific littoral flora on the Manchurian plains and lowlands.

TRANSCASPIAN REGION 



The lower terrace has the character of a steppe, but is intersected 
by a number of ranges, plications of Silurian and Devonian rocks, 
all running south-west to north-cast ; and all containing silver, lead, 
copper and auriferous sands. Agriculture can be easily carried on 
in the broad prairies, the only drawbacks being droughts, and frosts 
in the higher closed valleys of the Nerchinsk or Gazimur Mountains. 
The lower terrace is in its turn fringed by a border-ridge — the Great 
Khingan — which occupies, with reference^ to the lower terrace, the 
same position that the Yablonoi does in relation to the upper, 
and separates Siberia from northern Manchuria. This important 
ridge does not run from south to north, as represented on the old 
maps, but from [south-west to north-east ; it is pierced by the 
Amur near Albazin, and joins^ the Okhotsk Mountains, which 
however do not join the Yoblonoi Mountains. 

The rivers belong to three different systems — the affluents of 
Lake Baikal, of the Lena and of the Amur. Of the first the Selenga 
(800 m. long) rises in north-west Mongolia, one of its tributaries 
(the Egin-gol) being an emissary of Lake Kosso-gol. The Chikoi, 
Khilok and Uda are its chief tributaries in Transbaikalia. The 
Barguzin and the upper Angara enter Lake Baikal from the north- 
east. Of thetributaries of the Lena, the Vitim with its affluents 
(Karenga, Tsipa, and Muya) flows on the high plateau through un- 
inhabited regions, as also does the Olekma. The, tributaries of the 
Amur are much more important. The Argun, which at a quite recent 
epoch received the waters of the Dalai-nor, and thus had the Kerulen 
for its source, is no longer in communication with the rapidly 
desiccating Mongolian lake, but has its sources in the Gan, which 
flows from the Great Khingan Mountains. It is not navigable, 
but receives the Gazimur and several other streams from the 
Nerchinsk mining district. t f he Shilka is formed by the union 
of the Onon and the Chita rivers, and is navigable from the town of 
Chita, thus being an important channel to the Amur. 

Lake Baikal, with an area of 13,200 sq. m. (nearly equal to that 
of Switzerland), extends in a half crescent from south-west to 
north-east, with a length of nearly 400 m. and a width of 20 to 
50 m. Its level is 1,500 ft. above the sea. 1 The wide delta of the 
Selenga narrows it in the middle, and renders it shallower in the 
east than in the west. The other lakes include the Gusinoye and 
Lake Ba-unt on the Vitim plateau. Many lakes yield common salt. 

The high plateau is built up of granites, gneisses and syenites, 
overlain by Laurent ian schists. Silurian and Devonian marine 
deposits occur only on the lower terrace. Since that epoch the 
region has not been* under the sea, and only fresh-water Jurassic 
deposits and coal beds are met with in the depressions. During 
the Glacial period most of the high terrace and its border ridges were 
undoubtedly covered with vast glaciers. Volcanic rocks of more 
recent origin (Mesozoic?) are met with in the north-western 
border-ridge and on its slopes, as well as on the Vitim plateau. 
During the Glacial period the fauna of the lowest parts of Trans- 
baikalia was decidedly arctic; while during the Lacustrine or post- 
Glacial periods this region was dotted over with numberless lakes, 
the shores of which were inhabited by Neolithic man. Only few 
traces of these survive, and they are rapidly drying up. Earth- 
quakes are very frequent on the shores of Lake Baikal, especially at 
the mouth of the Selenga, and they extend as far as Irkutsk, 
Barguzin and Selenginsk; in 1862 an extensive area was submerged 
by the lake. Numerous mineral springs, some of them of high 
repute, exist all over Transbaikalia. The most important are the 
hot alkaline springs (130 F.) at Turka, at the mouth of the 
Barguzin, those of Pogromna on the Uda (very similar to the 
Seltzer springs), those of Molokova near Chita and those of Darasun 
in the Nerchinsk district. 

The climate is, as a whole, exceedingly dry. The winter is cold 
and dry, the thermometer dropping as low as — 58 F. But the snow 
is so trifling that the horses 01 the Buryats arc able to procure food 
throughout the winter on the steppes, and in the very middle of 
the winter wheeled vehicles are used all over the west. To the east 
of the Yablonoi ridge the Nerchinsk district feels the influence of 
the North Pacific monsoons, and snow falls more thickly, especially 
in the valleys; but the summer is hot and dry. On the high plateau 
even the summer is cold, owing to the altitude and the humidity 
arising from the marshes, and the soil is frozen to a great depth. 
At Chita the daily range in summer and spring is sometimes as much 
as 33 to 46°^ In the vicinity of Lake Baikal there is a cooler 
summer; in winter exceedingly deep snow covers the mountains 
around the lake. 2 

The estimated population in 1906 was 742, 200. The Russian 
population is gathered around the mines of the Nerchinsk 
district, while the steppes are occupied by the Buryats. A string 
of villages has been planted along the Shilka between Chita 
and Stryetensk. The valleys of the Uda, the lower Selenga, 
and especially the Chikoi and the Khilok have been occupied 
since the beginning of the 19th century by Raskolniks, some of 
whom, living in a condition of prosperity such as is unknown in 

1 There is uncertainty as to the absolute altitude (see Baikal).

Russia proper, rank amongst the finest representatives of the 
Russian race. The remainder of the steppe of the Uda is occu- 
pied by Buryats, while the forests and marshes of the plateau 
are the hunting grounds of the nomad Tunguses. South of the 
Khamar-daban the only settled region is the lower valley of 
the Jida. On the Upper Argun the Cossacks are in features, 
character, language and manners largely Mongolian. The 
Russians along the Chinese frontier constitute a separate 
voisko or division of the Transbaikal Cossacks. The Buryats 
number about 180,000, the Tunguses over 30,000. The 
province is divided into five districts, the chief towns of which 
are Chita, the capital, Barguzin, Nerchinsk, Selenginsk and 
Verkhneudinsk. 

Although a good deal of land has been cleared by the settlers, 
nearly one-half of the entire area is still covered with forests. The 
principal varieties are fir, larch, aspen, poplar and birch, with 
Abies gectinata in the north and the cedar in the south. Only about 
one-third of the surface is adaptable for cultivation, and of that 
only about one-tenth is actually under tillage. 

Agriculture is carried on to a limited extent by the Buryats and 
in all the Russian settlements; but it prospers only in the valleys 
of West Transbaikalia, and partly in the Nerchinsk region, while in 
the steppes of the Argun and Onon even the Russians resort to 
pastoral pursuits and trade, or to hunting. Livestock rearing is 
extensively carried on, especially by the Buryats, but their herds 
and flocks are often destroyed in great numbers by the snowstorms 
of spring. Hunting is an important occupation, even with the 
Russians, many of whom leave their homes in October to spend six 
weeks in the taiga (forest region). The fisheries of Lake Baikal and 
the lower parts of its affluents are important. Enormous quantities 
of Salmo omul are taken every year; and 5. thymalus, S. oxyrhynchus 
and S.fluviatilis are also taken. Mining, and especially gold mining, 
is important, but the production of gold has fallen off. Silver 
mines have only a very small output. Iron mining is gradually 
developing, and good coal mines are now being worked. Salt is 
raised from several lakes, and the extraction of Epsom salts has 
considerably developed. Manufactures, though insignificant, have 
increased. The trade is chiefly concentrated at Kiakhta. The 
Cossacks on the frontier traffic in brick-tea, cattle and hides with 
Mongolia. The export of furs is of considerable value. 

Transbaikalia «is crossed by the Trans-siberian railway from 
Mysovaya onLake Baikal, via Chita, to Stryetensk, and from Kaida- 
lovo, near Chita, to the Mongolian frontier; the latter section is 
continued across Manchuria to Vladivostok and Port Arthur. 
Regular steamer communication has been established along Lake 
Baikal, not only for the transport of passengers and goods between 
the two railway stations of Listvinichnoye and Mysovaya, but also 
with the object of developing the fishing industry, which is of great 
importance. Steamers ply up the Selenga river as far as Selenginsk, 
considerable cargoes of tea being transported along this line.

TRANSCASPIAN REGION, a Russian territory on the E. 
of the Caspian, bounded S. by Khorasan and Afghanistan, 
N. by the Russian province of Uralsk, N.E. by Khiva and 
Bokhara and S.E. by Afghan Turkestan. Area, 212,545 sq. m. 
Some of the most interesting problems of geography, such as 
those relating to the changes in the course of the Jaxartes 
(Syr-darya) and the Oxus (Amu-darya), and the supposed 
periodical disappearance of Lake Aral, are connected with the 
Transcaspian deserts ; and it is here that we must look for a clue 
to the physical changes which transformed the Euro-Asiatic 
Mediterranean — the Aral-Caspian and Pontic basin — into a series 
of separate seas, and desiccated them, powerfully influencing 
the distribution of floras and faunas, and centuries ago com- 
pelling the inhabitants of Western and Central Asia to enter 
upon their great migrations. But down to a comparatively 
recent date the arid, barren deserts, peopled only by wandering 
Turkomans, were almost a terra incognita. 

A mountain chain, comparable in length to the Alps, separates 
the deserts of the Transcaspian from the highlands of Khorasan. 
It begins in the Krasnovodsk peninsula of the Caspian, under the 
names of Kuryanyn-kary and Great Balkans, whose masses of 
granite and other crystalline rock reach an altitude of some 5350 ft. 
Farther south-east they are continued in the Little Balkans (2000 ft.) 
and the Kopepet-dagh or Kopet-dagh. The latter rises steep and 
rugged above the flat deserts over a stretch of 600 m. In structure 
it is homologous with the Caucasus chain ; it appears as an outer 
wall of the Khorasan plateau, and is separated from it by a broad 
valley, which, like the Rion and Kura valley of Transcaucasia, is 
drained by two rivers flowing in opposite directions — the Atrek, which 
flows north-west into the Caspian, and the Keshef-rud, which flows to

the south-east and is a tributary of the Murghab. On the other side 
of this valley the Alla-dagh (Aladagh) and the Binalund border- 
ranges (9000 to 11,000 ft.) fringe the edge of the Khorasan plateau. 
Descending towards the steppe with steep stony slopes, the mountain 
barrier of the Kopet-dagh rises to heights of 6000-9000 ft. to the east 
of Kyzyl-arvat, while the passes which lead from the Turkoman 
deserts to the valleys of Khorasan are seldom as low as 3500, and 
usually rise to 5000, 6000 and even 8500 ft., and in most cases are 
very difficult. It is pierced by only one wide opening, that between 
the Great and Little Balkans, through which the sea, which once 
covered the steppe, maintained connexion with the Caspian. 

While the Alla-dagh and Binalund border-ranges are chiefly 
composed of crystalline rocks and metamorphic slates, overlain 
by Devonian deposits, a series of more recent formations — Upper 
and Lower Cretaceous and Miocene — crops out in the outer wall 
of the Kopet-dagh. Here again we find that the mountains of Asia 
which stretch towards the north-west continued to be uplifted at 
a geologically recent epoch. Quarternary deposits have an extensive 
development on its slopes, and its foothills are bordered by a girdle 
of loess. 

The loess terrace, called Atok (" mountain base ")». 10 to 20^ m. 
in width, is very fertile; but it will produce nothing without irriga- 
tion, and the streams flowing from the Kopet-dagh are few and scanty. 
The winds which impinge upon the northern slope of the mountains 
have been deprived of all their moisture in crossing the Kara-kum — 
the Black Sands of the Turkoman desert; and even such rain as 
falls on the Kopet-dagh (io£ in. a,t Kyzyl-arvat) too often reaches 
the soil in the shape of light showers which do not penetrate it, so 
that the average relative humidity is only 56 as compared with 62 
at even so dry a place as Krasnovodsk. Still, at those places where 
the mountain streams run closer to one another, as at Geok-tepe, 
Askhabad, Lutfabad and Kaaka, the villages are more populous, and 
the houses are surrounded by gardens, every square yard and every 
tree of which 13 nourished by irrigation. 

North of this narrow strip of irrigated land begins the desert — 
the Kara-kum — which extends from the mountains of Khorasan 
to Lake Aral and the plateau of Ust-Urt, and from the Caspian 
to the Amu-darya, interrupted only by the oases of Merv and 
Tejen. But the terrible shifting sands, blown into barkhans, or 
elongated hills, sometimes 50 and 60 ft. in height, are accumulated 
chiefly in the west, where the country has more recently emerged 
from the sea. Farther east the barkhans are more stable. Large 
areas amidst the sands are occupied by takyrs, or flat surfaces paved 
with clay, which, as a rule, is hard but becomes almost impassable 
after heavy rains. In these takyrs the Turkomans dig ditches, drain- 
ing into a kind of cistern, where the water of the spring rains can 
be preserved for a few months. Wells also are sunk, and the water 
is found in them at depths of 10 to 50, or occasionally 100 ft. and 
more. All is not desert in the strict sense; in spring there is for 
the most part a carpet of grass. 

The vegetation of the Kara-kum cannot be described as poor. 
The typical representative of the sandy deserts of Asia, the saksaul 
(Anabasis ammodendron) , has been almost destroyed within the 
last hundred years, and occurs only sporadically, but the borders 
of the spaces covered with saline clay are brightened by forests 
of tamarisk, which are inhabited by great numbers of the desert 
warbler (Atraphornis aralensis) — a typical inhabitant of the sands— 
sparrows and ground-choughs (Podoces); the Houbara macgueeni, 
though not abundant, is characteristic of the region. Hares and 
foxes, jackals and wolves, marmots, moles, ^ hedgehogs and one 
species of marten live in the steppe, especially in spring. As a whole, 
the fauna is richer than might be supposed, while in the Atok it 
contains representatives of all the species known in Turkestan, 
intermingled with Persian and Himalayan species. 

The Uzboi. — A feature distinctive of the Turkoman desert is the 
very numerous shors, or elongated depressions, the lower portion 
of which are mostly occupied with moist sand. They are obviously 
the relics of brackish lakes, and, like the lakes of the Kirghiz steppes, 
they often follow one another in quick succession, thus closely 
resembling river-beds. As the direction of the ,shors is generally 
from the higher terraces drained by the Amu-darya towards the 
lowlands of the Caspian, they were usually regarded as old beds 
of the Amu-darya, and were held to support the idea of its once 
having flowed across the Turkoman desert towards what is now 
the Caspian Sea. 'It was formerly considered almost settled, not 
only that that river (see Oxus) flowed into the Caspian during histor- 
ical times, but that after having ceased to jdo so in the 7th century, 
its waters were again diverted to the Caspian about 1221. A chain 
of elongated depressions, bearing a faint resemblance to old river- 
beds, was traced from Urgenj to the gap between the Great and the 
Little Balkans; this was marked on the maps as the Uzboi, or old 
bed of the Oxus. 1 The idea of again diverting the Amu into the 
Caspian was thus set afloat, but the investigations of Russian engi- 
neers, especially A. E. Hedroitz, A. M. Konshin, I. V. Mushketov, 

1 On the original Russian map of the Transcaspian, drawn 
immediately after the survey of the Uzboi had been completed, the 
Uzboi has not the continuity which is given to it on subsequent 
maps. 



P. M. Lessar and Svintsov, 2 went to show that the Uzboi is no 
river-bed at all, and that no river has ever discharged its waters 
in that direction. The existence of an extensive lacustrine depres- 
sion, now represented by the small Sary-kamysh lakes, was proved, 
and it was evident that this depression, having a length of more 
than 130 m., a width of 70 m., and a depth of 280 ft. below the present 
level of Lake Aral, would have to be filled by the A.mu before its 
waters could advance farther to the south-west. The sill of this 
basin being only 28 ft. below the present level of Lake Aral, this 
latter could not be made to disappear, nor even be notably reduced 
in size, by the Amu flowing south-west from Urgenj. A more careful 
exploration of the Uzboi has shown that, while the deposits in the 
Sary-kamysh depression, and the Aral shells they contain, bear 
unmistakable testimony to the fact of the basin having once been 
fed by the Amu-darya, no such traces are found along the Uzboi 
below the Sary-kamysh depression ;* on the contrary, shells of molluscs 
still inhabiting the Caspian are found in numbers all along it, and 
the supposed old bed has all the characteristics of a series of lakes 
which continued to subsist along the foothills of the Ust-Urt plateau, 
while the Caspian was slowly receding westwards during the post- 
Pliocene period. On rare occasions only did the waters of the Sary- 
kamysh, when raised by inundations above the sill just mentioned, 
send their surplus into the Uzboi. It appears most probable that 
in the 16th century the Sary-kamysh was confounded with a gulf 
of the Caspian; 4 and this gives much plausibility to KonshnVs 
supposition that the changes in the lower course of the Amu (which 
no geologist would^ venture to ascribe to man, if they were to mean 
the alternative discharge of the Amu into the Caspian and Lake 
Aral) merely meant that by means of appropriate dams the Amu 
was made to flow in the I3th-i6th centuries alternately into Lake 
Aral and into the Sary-kamysh. 

The ancient texts (of Pliny, Strabo, Ptolemy) about the Jaxartes 
and Oxus only become intelligible when it is admitted that, since 
the epoch to which they relate, the outlines of the Caspian Sea 
and Lake Aral have undergone notable changes, commensurate 
with those which are supposed to have occurred in the courses of 
the Central Asian rivers.The desiccation of the Aral-Caspian basin 
proceeded with such rapidity that the shores of the Caspian cannot 
possibly have maintained for some twenty centuries the outlines 
which they exhibit at present.^ Whenstudied in detail, the general 
configuration of ttie Transcaspian region leaves no doubt that both 
the Jaxartes and the Oxus, with its former tributaries, the Murghab 
and the Tejeii, once flowed towards the west; but the Caspian of 
that time was not the sea of our days; its gulfs penetrated the 
Turkoman steppe, and washed the base of the Ust-Urt plateau. (See 
Caspian and Aral.) 

Kelif-UzboL — There is also no doubt that, instead of flowing 
north-westward of Kelif (on the present Bokhara-Afghan frontier), 
the Amu once bent south to join the Murghab and Tejen ; the chain 
of depressions described by the Russian engineers as the Kelif- 
Uzboi 6 supports this hypothesis, which a geographer cannot avoid 
making when studying a map of the Transcaspian region; but the 
date at which the Oxus followed such a course, and the extension 
which the Caspian basin then had towards the east, are uncertain. 

In 1897 the population numbered 377,416, of whom only 
42,431 lived in towns; but, besides those of whom the census 
took account, there were about 25,000 strangers and troops. 

2 Their original papers are printed in the Izvestia of the Russian 
Geographical Society, 1883 to 1887, also in the Journal of the Russian 
ministry of roads and communications. 

'According to A. E. Hedroitz and A.M. Konshin the old Tonu- 
darya bed of the Amu contains shells of molluscs now living in the 
Amu (Cyrena fluminalis, Dreissensia polymorpha and Anodonta). 
The Sary-kamysh basin is characterized by deposits containing 
Neritina liturata, Dreissensia polymorpha and Limnaeus, character- 
istic of this basin. Below the Sary-kamysh there are no deposits 
containing shells characteristic of the Amu; Anodontae are found 
quite occasionally on the surface, not in beds, in company with the 
Caspian Cardium (Didacna) trigonoides, var. crassum, Cardium 
piramidatum. Dreissensia polymorpha, D. rostriformis } Hydrobia 
caspia t Neritina liturata and Dreissensia beardii; the red clays 
containing these fossils extend for 130 m. east of the Caspian (Izvestia 
of Russ. Geog. Soc, 1883 and 1886). 

4 As by Jenkinson, who mentions a freshwater gulf of the Caspian 
within six days' march from Khwarezm (or Khiva), by which gulf 
he could only mean the Sary-kamysh depression. 

5 The Turkomans call this southern " old bed " Unghyuz or Onguz 
(" dry old bed "), and there can be no doubt that when the Bolshoi- 
Chertezh of the 16th century (speaking from anterior information) 
mentions a river, Ughyuz or Ugus, flowing west from the Amu 
towards the Caspian, it is merely describing as a river what the very 
name shows to have been a dry bed, supposed to have been once 
occupied by a river. The similarity of the names Ongus and Ugus 
with Ogus and Ochus possibly helped to accentuate, if not to give 
rise to, the confusion. Cf. N. G. Petrusevich, " The South-east 
Shores of the Caspian," in Zapiski of the Caucasian Geographical 
Society (1880), vol. xi.

Included in the total were some 280,000 Turkomans, 60,000 
Kirghiz, 12,000 Russians, 8000 Persians, 4250 Armenians, and 
some Tatars. The estimated population in 1906 was 397,100. 
The province is divided into five districts, the chief towns of 
which are Askhabad, the capital; Krasnovodsk; Fort Alexan- 
drovskiy, in the district of Manghishlak, on the Caspian Sea; 
Merv and Tejen. Until a recent date the chief occupations of 
the Turkomans were cattle-rearing and robbery. Even those 
who had settled abodes on the oases of the Atok, Tejen and Merv 
were in the habit of encamping during the spring in the steppes, 
the khanates of Afghan Turkestan from Balkh to Meshhed being 
periodically devastated by them. The aspect of the steppe 
has, however, greatly changed since the Russian advance and 
the fall (1881) of the Turkoman stronghold of Geok-tepe. Their 
principal oases are situated along the Atok or loess terrace, the 
chief settlements being Askhabad, Kyzyl-arvat and Geok-tepe. 
The oasis of Merv is inhabited hy Akhal-tekkes (about 240,000), 
mostly poor. In January 1887 they submitted to Russia. The 
oasis of Tejen has sprung up where the river Tejen (Heri-rud) 
terminates in the desert. 

South-west Turcomania. — The region between the Heri-rud and 
the Murghab has the characteristics of a plateau, reaching about 
2000 ft. above the sea, with hills 500 and 600 ft. high covered' with 
sand, the spaces between being filled with loess. The Borkhut 
Mountains which connect the Kopet-dagh with the Sefid-kuh in 
Afghanistan reach 3000 to 4000 ft., and are cleft by the Heri-rud. 
Thickets of poplar and^ willow accompany both the Murghab and 
the Heri-rud. Pistachio and mulberry trees grow in isolated clumps 
on the hills ; but there are few places available for cultivation, and 
the Saryk Turkomans (some 60,000 in number) congregate in only 
two oases — Yol-otan or Yelatan, and Penjdeh. The Sarakhs oasis 
is occupied by the Salor Turkomans, hereditary enemies of the Tekke 
Turkomans; they number about 3000 tents at Old Sarakhs, and 1700 
more on the Murghab, at Chardjui, at Maimene (or Meimane), and 
close to Herat. > 

The Transcaspian Region is very rich in minerals. Rock-salt, 
petroleum, gypsum and sulphur are extracted. Nearly 300,000 
acres are irrigated by the natives, and attempts are being made by 
the government to increase the irrigated area; it is considered that 
over 5,000,000 acres of land could be rendered suitable for agriculture. 
Several hundred thousand trees are planted every year, and a forest 
guard has been established to prevent useless destruction of the 
saksaul trees, "which grow freely in the steppes. A model garden 
and a mulberry plantation have been established at Askhabad 
in connexion with the gardening school. The land in the oases, 
especially those of the Atrek River, is highly cultivated. Wheat and 
barley are grown, in addition to sorghum (a species of millet), maize, 
rice, millet and sesame for oil. Raw cotton is extensively grown in 
the Merv district. Gardening and fruit-growing are well developed, 
and attempts are being made to encourage the spread of viticulture. 
Livestock breeding is the chief occupation of the nomad Turkomans 
and Kirghiz. Considerable fishing is carried on in the Caspian Sea, 
and seats are killed off the Manghishlak peninsula. The natives 
excel in domestic industries, as the making of carpets, travelling 
bags, felt goods and embroidered leather. The Russian population 
is mostly limited to the military and the towns. Wheat, flour, wool, 
raw cotton and dried^ fruit are exported ; while tea, manufactured 
goods, timber, sugar, iron and paraffin oil are imported, as also rice 
and fruit from Bokhara, Turkestanand Persia. The Transcaspian 
railway, constructed across the province from Krasnovodsk to Merv, 
with a branch to Kushk, and from Merv to Bokhara and Russian 
Turkestan, has effected quite a revolution in the trade of # Central 
Asia. The old caravan routes via Orenburg have lost their impor- 
tance, and goods coming from India, Persia, Bokhara and even 
China are now carried by rail. (For the history of the region 
see Merv.)

TRANSCAUCASIA, a general name given to the governments 
and provinces of Russian Caucasia, excluding the steppe 
provinces of Kuban and Terek and the steppe government 
of Stavropol. It thus includes the governments of Baku, 
Elisavetpol, Erivan, Kutais and Tiflis; the provinces of Batum, 
Daghestan and Kars; and the military districts of the Black 
Sea (Chernomorsk) and Zakataly. Its area is 95,402 sq. m., 
and the estimated population in 1906 was 6,114,600. (See 
Caucasia and Caucasus.) 



TRANSCENDENTALISM (Lat. trans, across, scandere, climb, 
whence transcendere, to pass a limit), in philosophy, any system 
which emphasizes the limited character of that which can be 
perceived by the senses and is based on the view that true know- 
ledge is intuitive, or supernatural. The term is specially applied 
to Kant's philosophy and its successors which hold that know- 
ledge of the a priori is possible. It is traceable as far back as 
the schoolmen of whom Duns Scotus describes as " transcen- 
dental " those conceptions which have a higher degree of univer- 
sality than the Aristotelian categories. Thus ens (being) is 
more universal than God or the physical universe because it 
can be predicated of both. Kant distinguishes as " transcen- 
dent " the world of things-in-themselves as being without the 
limits of experience; while " transcendental " is his term for 
those elements which regulate human experience, though they 
are themselves beyond experience; such are the categories of 
space, time, causality. 

In general use the term is applied rather promiscuously and 
frequently by way of criticism to an attitude of mind which is 
imaginative, aloof from mundane affairs and unmoved by 
practical considerations. The most famous example of the 
pseudo-philosophic use of the term is for a movement of thought 
which was prominent in the New England states from about 
1830 to 1850. Its use originated in the Transcendental Club 
(1836) founded by Emerson, Frederic Henry Hedge (1805-1890), 
and others. This movement had several aspects: philosophical, 
theological, social, economic. Its main theme was regeneration, 
a revolt from the formalism of both Unitarian' and Calvinist 
theology and a widening literary outlook. It took its rise to a 
large extent in the study of German (and to a less extent French) 
philosophy and spread widely among the cultured classes. 
In 1840 the club began to issue an official organ, The Dial, 
and the settlement of Brook Farm (q.v.) followed in 1841. 
These enterprises themselves did not receive general support 
even among the Transcendentalist leaders, and the real signifi- 
cance of the movement was the stimulus which it gave to 
philanthropy, to the Abolition movement, and to a new ideal of 
individual character. The chief names associated with it, 
besides those of Emerson and Hedge, are those of A. B. Alcott 
(q.v.), Margaret Fuller (q.v.), George Ripley (q.v.), W. E. 
Channing (q.v.), and H. D. Thoreau (q.v.). 

TRANSEPT (from Lat. trans, across, and septum, enclosure; 
synonymous terms in other languages are Fr. croisie, nef trans- 
versie; Ital. crociata; Ger. Querbau, Querschiff), in architecture, 
the term given to the large and lofty structure which lies at 
right angles to the nave and aisles of a church. The first example 
is that which existed in the old St Peter's at Rome, but as a rule 
it is not found in the early basilicas. At the present day the 
transept might be better defined as that portion of a cruciform 
church which extends from north to south across the main body 
of the building and usually separates the choir from the nave; 
but to this there are some exceptions, as in Westminster Abbey, 
where the choir, with its rood screen, occupies the first four bays 
of the nave; in Norwich two bays; in Gloucester one bay; and 
Winchester one bay. In some of the English cathedrals there 
is an eastern transept, as in Canterbury, Lincoln, Salisbury and 
Worcester; at Durham that which might be regarded as an 
eastern transept is the chapel of the Nine Altars, and the same 
is found in Fountains Abbey. Four of the English cathedrals 
have aisles on east and west sides, viz. Ely, Wells, Winchester and 
York, while at Chester there are aisles to tjie south transept only, 
and at Lincoln, Peterborough and Salisbury on the east side 
only. In some cases the transept extends to the outer walls 
of the aisles only, but .there are many instances in which it is 
carried beyond, as at Lincoln (225 ft. long), Ely (180 ft.), Peter- 
borough (180 ft.), Durham (175 ft.) and Norwich (172 ft.) ; in all 
these cases the transept is carried three bays beyond; in York 
(220 ft.), St Albans (170 ft.), Lichfield (145 ft.) and Canterbury, 
east transept (165 ft.), two bays beyond; and in Canterbury, 
western transept (130 ft.), Chichester (160 ft.) and Worcester 
(130 ft.), only one bay on each side, the dimension in all cases 
being taken within the north and south walls of the transept. 



TRANSFER— TRANSFORMERS 



173 






TRANSFER (from Lat. transferrer to bear across, carry over), 
the handing over, removal or conveyance of anything from one 
person or place to another; also the subject of this transference 
or the form or method by which it is effected. The term is 
particularly used in law of the conveyance of property from one 
person to another, especially of the conveyance of real property 
(see Conveyancing). For the simplification of this process by 
means of registration of title, see Land Registration. For the 
transference of designs, drawings, &c, by means of transfer- 
paper to the surface of pottery and porcelain, see Ceramics; 
for their transfer to stones for printing, see Lithography. 

TRANSFORMERS. An electrical transformer is the name 
given to any device for producing by means of one electric 
current another of a different character. The working of such 
an appliance is, of course, subject to the law of conservation of 
energy. The resulting current represents less power than the 
applied current, the difference being represented by the power 
dissipated in the translating process. Hence an electrical 
transformer corresponds to a simple machine in mechanics, 
both transforming power from one form into another with a 
certain energy-dissipation depending upon frictional losses, 
or something equivalent to them. Electrical transformers 
may be divided into several classes, according to the nature of 
the transformation effected. The first division comprises those 
which change the form of the power, but keep the type of the 
current the same; the second those that change the type of 
the current as well as the form of power. The power given up 
electrically to any circuit is measured by the product of the 
effective value of the current, the effective value of the difference 
of potential between the ends of the circuit and a factor called 
the power factor. In dealing with periodic currents, the effective 
value is that called the root-mean-square value (R.M.S.), that 
is to say, the square root of the mean of the squares of the time 
equidistant instantaneous values during one complete period 
(see Electrokinetics). In the case of continuous current, 
the power factor is unity, and the effective value of the current 
or voltage is the true mean value. As the electrical measure of 
a power is always a product involving current and voltage, we 
may transform the character of the power by increasing or 
diminishing the current with a corresponding decrease or increase 
of the voltage. A transformer which raises voltage is generally 
called a step-up transformer, and one which lowers voltage 
a step-down transformer. 

Again, electric currents may be of various types, such as con- 
tinuous, single-phase alternating, polyphase alternating, undirec- 
tional but pulsating, &c. Accordingly, transformers may be 
distinguished in another way, in accordance with the type of 
transformation they effect. (1) An alternating current trans- 
former is an appliance for creating an alternating current of any 
required magnitude and electromotive force from another of 
different value and electromotive force, but of the same fre- 
quency. An alternating current transformer may be con- 
structed to transform either single-phase or polyphase currents. 
(2) A continuous current transformer is an appliance which effects 
a similar transformation for continuous currents, with the 
difference that some part of the machine must revolve, whereas 
in the alternating current transformer all parts of the machine 
are stationary; hence the former is generally called a rotatory 
transformer, and the latter a static transformer. (3) A rotatory 
or rotary transformer may consist of one machine, or of two 
separate machines, adapted for converting a single-phase alter- 
nating current into a polyphase current, or a polyphase current 
into a continuous current, or a continuous current into an alter- 
nating current. If the portions receiving and putting out power 
are separate machines, the combination is called a motor-gene- 
rator. (4) A transformer adapted for converting a single-phase 
alternating current into a unidirectional but pulsatory current 
is called a rectifier, and is much used in connexion with arc 
lighting in alternating current supply stations. (5) A phase trans- 
former is an arrangement of static transformers for producing 
a polyphase alternating current from a single-phase alternating 
current. Alternating current transformers may be furthermore 



divided into (a) single-phase, (b) polyphase. Transformers of 
the first class change an alternating current of single-phase 
to one of single-phase identical frequency, but different power; 
and transformers of the second class operate in a similar manner 
on polyphase currents. (6) The ordinary induction or spark 
coil may be called an intermittent current transformer, since it 
transforms an intermittent low-tension primary current into an 
intermittent or alternating high-tension current. 

Alternating Current Transformer. — The typical alternating 
current transformer consists essentially of two insulated electric 
circuits wound on an iron core constituting the magnetic 
circuit. They may be divided into (1) open magnetic circuit 
static transformers, and (2) closed magnetic circuit static trans- 
formers, according as the iron core takes the form of a terminated 
bar or a closed ring. A closed circuit alternating current trans- 
former consists of an iron core built up of thin sheets of iron or 
steel, insulated from one another, and wound over with two 
insulated conducting circuits, called the primary and secondary 
circuits. The core must be laminated or built up of thin sheets 
of iron to prevent local electric currents, called eddy currents, 
from being established in it, which would waste energy. In 
practical construction, the core is either a simple ring, round or 
rectangular, or a double rectangular ring, that is," a core whose 
section is like the figure 8. To prepare the core, thin sheets of 
iron or very mild steel, not thicker than *oi4 of an inch, are 
stamped out of special iron (see Electromagnetism) and care- 
fully annealed. 

The preparation of the particular sheet steel or iron used for this 
purpose is now a speciality. It must possess extremely small 
hysteresis loss (see Magnetism), and various trade names, such as 
" stalloy," " lohys," are in use to describe certain brands. Barrett, 
Brown and Hadfield have shown (Journ. Inst. Elec. Eng. Lond. t 
1902, 31, p. 713) that a silicon iron containing 2*87% of silicon has 
a hysteresis loss far less than that of the best Swedish soft iron. 
In any case the hysteresis loss should not exceed 3-0 watts per kilo- 
gram of^ iron measured at a frequency of 50 ~ and a flux-density of 
10,000 lines per square centimetre. This is now called tie " figure 
of merit " of the iron. 

Examples of the shapes in which these stampings 'are supplied 
are shown in fig. 1. The plates when annealed are varnished or 
covered with thin paper on one side, and then piled up so as to 
make an iron core, being kept together by bolts and nuts or by 
pressure plates. The designer of a 
transformer core has in view, first, 
economy in metal, so that there may 
be no waste fragments, and second, 
a mode of construction that facili- 
tates the winding of the wire circuits. 
These consist of coils of cotton- 
covered copper wire which are wound 
on formers and baked after being well 
saturated with shellac varnish. The 
primary and secondary circuits are 
sometimes formed of separate bobbins 
which are sandwiched in between 
each other; in other cases they are 
wound one over the other (fig. 2). 
In any case the primary and secondary coils must be symmetri- 
cally distributed. If they were placed on opposite sides of the 
iron circuit the result would be considerable magnetic leakage. 
It is usual to insert sheets or cylinders of micanite between the 
primary and secondary windings. The transformer is then well 
baked and placed in a cast-iron case sometimes filled in with heavy 
insulating oil, the ends of the primary and secondary circuits being 
brought out through water-tight glands. The most ordinary type 
of alternating current transformer is one intended to transform a 
small electric current produced by a large electromotive force 
£2000 to 10,000 volts) into a larger current of low electromotive force 
(100 to 200 volts). Such a stet> 
down transformer^ may be obvi- 
ously _ employed in the reverse 
direction for raising pressure and 
reducing current, in which case it 
is a step-up transformer. A trans- 
former when manufactured has to 
be carefully tested to ascertain, 
first, its power of resisting break- 
down, and, second, its energy- 
dissipating qualities. With the 
first object, the transformer is 
subjected to a series of pressure 
tests. If it is intended that the [Fig. 2. — Closed Circuit Trans- 
primary shall carry a current former.

produced by an electromotive force of 2000 volts, an insulation test 
must be applied with double this voltage between the primary and 
the secondary, the primary and the case, and the primary and the 
core, to ascertain whether the insulation is sufficient. To prevent 
electric discharges from breaking down the machine in ordinary 
work, this extra pressure ought to be applied for at least a quarter 
of an hour. In some cases three or four times the working pressure 
is applied for one minute between the primary and secondary circuits. 
When such an alternating current transformer has an alternating 
current passed through its primary circuit, an alternating magnetiza- 
tion is produced in the core, and this again induces an alternating 
secondary current. The secondary current has a greater or less 
electromotive force than the primary current according as the 
number of windings or turns on the secondary circuit is greater or 
less than those on the primary. Of the power thus imparted to 
the primary circuit one portion is dissipated by the heat generated 
in the primaryand secondary circuits by the currents, and another 
portion by the iron core losses due to the energy wasted in the cyclical 
magnetization of the core; the latter are partly eddy current losses 
and partly hysteresis losses. 

In open magnetic circuit transformers the core takes the form of 
a laminated iron bar or a bundle of iron wire. An ordinary induc- 
tion coil is an instrument of this description. It has been shown, 
however, by careful experiments, that for alternating current trans- 
formation there are very few cases in which the closed magnetic 
circuit transformer has not an advantage. An immense number 
of designs of closed circuit transformers have been elaborated since 
the year 1885. The principal modern types are the Ferranti, Kapp, 
Mordey, Brush, Westinghouse, Berry, Thomson-Houston and Ganz. 
Diagrammatic representations of the arrangements of the core and 
circuits in some of these transformers are given in fig. 3.

1, 1 Primary circuit; 2, 2 Secondary circuit. 
Alternating current transformers are classified into (i.) Core 
and (ii.) Shell transformers, depending upon the arrangements 
of the iron and copper circuits. If the copper circuits are wound 
on the outside of what is virtually an iron ring, the transformer 
is a core transformer; if the iron encloses the copper circuits, it 
is a shell transformer. Shell transformers have the disadvantage 
generally of poor ventilaton for the copper circuits. Berry, 
however, has overcome this difficulty by making the iron circuit 
in the form of a number of bunches of rectangular frames which 
are set in radial fashion and the adjacent legs all embraced by 
the two copper circuits in the form of a pair of concentric 
cylinders. In this manner he secures good ventilation and a 
minimum expenditure in copper and iron, as well as the possi- 
bility of insulating the two copper circuits well from each other 
and from the core. An important matter is the cooling of the 
core. This may be effected either by ordinary radiation, or 
by a forced draught of air made by a fan or else by immersing 
the transformer in oil, the oil being kept cool by pipes through 
which cold water circulates immersed in it. This last method 
is adopted for large high-tension transformers. 

The ratio between the power given out by a transformer 
and the power taken up by it is called its efficiency, and is best 
Efficiency. re P rese nted by a curve, of which the ordinate is 
the efficiency expressed as a percentage, and the 
corresponding abscissae represent the fractions of the full load 
as decimal fractions. The output of the transformer is generally 
reckoned in kilowatts, and the load is conveniently expressed 
in. decimal fractions of the full load taken as unity. The 
efficiency on one-tenth of full load is generally a fairly good 
criterion of the economy of the transformer as a transforming 
agency. In large transformers the one-tenth load efficiency 
will reach 90% or more, and in small transformers 75 to 80%. 






The general form of the efficiency curve for a closed circuit trans- 
former is shown in fig. 4. The horizontal distances represent 
fractions of full secondary load (represented by unity), and the 
vertical distances efficiency in percentages. The efficiency 
curve has a maximum value corresponding to that degree of 
load at which the copper losses, 'in the transformer are equal to 
the iron losses. 

In the case of modern closed magnetic circuit transformers the 
copper losses are proportional to the square of the secondary cur- 
rent (I 2 ) or to qh\ where g = Ria 2 +R 2 ; R t being the resistance 
ot the primary and R 2 that of the secondary circuit, while a is 
the ratio of the number of secondary and primary windings of 
the transformer. Let C stand for the core loss, and V 2 for the 
secondary terminal potential difference (R.M.S. value). We can 
then write as an expression for the efficiency (rj) of the transformer 
{V = UV2/ (C + gI 2 2 +I 2 V 2 ). It is easy to show that if Ci, V 2 and 
q are constants, but I 2 is variable, the above expression for tj has 
a maximum value when C-qh 2 = 0, that is, when the iron core 
loss C = the total copper losses gl 2 2 . 

The iron core energy-waste, due to the hysteresis and eddy 
currents, may be stated in watts, or expressed as a fraction 
of the full load secondary output. In small trans- iron and 
formers of 1 to 3 kilowatts output it may amount Copper 
to 2 or 3%, and in large transformers of 10 to 50. Losses. 
kilowatts and upwards it. should be 1 or less than 1%. 
Thus the core loss of a 30-kilowatt transformer (one having a 
secondary output of 30,000 watts) should not exceed 250 watts. 
It has been shown that 
for the constant po- 
tential transformer the 
iron core loss is constant 
at all loads, but di- 
minishes slightly as the 
core temperature rises. 
On the other hand, the 
copper losses due to 
the resistance of the 
copper circuits increase £J 
about 0-4% per degree 
C. with rise of tempera- 
ture. The current taken 
in at the primary side of 
the transformer, when 
the secondary circuit is 
unclosed, is called the 

magnetizing current, and the power then absorbed by the 
transformer is * called the open circuit loss or magnetizing 
watts. The ratio of the terminal potential difference at 
the primary and secondary terminals is called the trans- 
formation ratio of the transformer. Every transformer is 
designed to give a certain transformation ratio, corresponding 
to some particular primary voltage. In some cases trans- 
formers are designed to transform, not potential difference, 
but current in a constant ratio. The product of the root-mean- 
square (R.M.S. ), effective or virtual, values of the primary 
current, and the primary terminal potential difference, is called 
the apparent power or apparent watts given to the transformer. 
The true electrical power may be numerically equal to this 
product, but it is never greater, and is sometimes less. The 
ratio of the true power to the apparent power is called the power 
factor of the transformer. The power factor approaches unity 
in the case of a closed circuit transformer, which is loaded non- 
inductively on the secondary circuit to any considerable fraction 
of its full load, but in the case of an open circuit transformer 
the power factor is always much less than unity at all loads. 
Power factor curves show the variation of power factor with load. 
Examples of these curves were first .given by J. A. Fleming, 
who suggested the term itself (see Jour. Inst. Elec. Eng. Lond. f 
1892, 2i, p. 606). A low power factor always implies a magnetic 
circuit of large reluctance. 

The operation of the alternating current is then as follows: the 
periodic magnetizing force of the primary circuit creates a periodic 
magnetic flux in the core, and this being linked with the primary 
circuit creates by its variation what is called the back electromotive 
force in the primary circuit. The variation of the particular portion

of this periodic flux, linked with^ the secondary circuit, originates 
in this last a periodic electromotive force. The whole of the flux 
linked with the primary circuit is not interlinked with the secondary 
circuit. The difference is called the magnetic leakage of the trans- 
former. This leakage is increased with the secondary output of the 
transformer and with any disposition of the primary and secondary 
coils which tends to separate them. The leakage exhibits itself 
by increasing the secondary drop. If a transformer is worked at 
a constant primary potential difference, the secondary terminal 
potential difference at no load or on open secondary circuit is 
greater than it is when the secondary is closed and the transformer 
giving its full output. The difference between these last two 
differences of potential is called the secondary drop. This secondary 
drop should not exceed 2 % of the open secondary circuit potential 
difference. 

The facts required to be known about an alternating current 
transformer to appraise its value are (1) its full load secondary 

output or the numerical value of the power it is 
menu*** designed to transform, on the assumption that it 

will not rise in temperature more than about 6o° C. 
above the atmosphere when in normal use; (2) the primary and 
secondary terminal voltages and currents, accompanied by a 
statement whether the transformer is intended for producing 
a constant secondary voltage or a constant secondary current; 
(3) the efficiency at various fractions on secondary load from 
one-tenth to full load taken at a stated frequency; (4) the power 
factor at one-tenth of full load and at full load; (5) the secondary 
drop between full load and no load; (6) the iron core loss, also the 
magnetizing current, at the normal frequency; (7) the total 
copper losses at full load and at one-tenth of full load; (8) the 
final temperature of the transformer after being left on open 
secondary circuit but normal primary potential for twenty-four 
hours, and at full load for three hours. 

The matters of most practical importance in connexion with an 
alternating current transformer are (1) the iron core loss, which 
affects the efficiency chiefly, and must be considered (a) as to its 
initial value, and (b) as affected by " ageing " or use ; (2) the secondary 
drop or difference of secondary voltage between full and no load, 
primary voltage being constant, since this affects the service and 
power of the transformer to work in parallel with others;. and (3) the 
temperature rise when in normal use, which affects the insulation 
and life of the transformer. The shellacked cotton, oil and other 
materials with which the^ transformer circuits are insulated suffer 
a deterioration in insulating power if continuously maintained at 
any temperature much above 8o° C. to ioo° C. In taking the tests 
for core loss and drop, the temperature of the transformer should 
therefore be stated. The iron losses are reduced in value as tem- 
perature rises and the copper losses are increased. The former may 
be 10 to 15% less and the latter 20% greater than when the trans- 
former is cold. For the purpose of calculations we require to know 
the number of turns on the primary and secondary circuits, repre- 
sented by Ni and N2 ; the resistances of the primary and secondary 
circuits, represented by Ri and R2; the volume (V) and weight (W) 
of the iron core ; and the mean length (L) and section (Sj of the 
magnetic sectio*n. The hysteresis loss of the iron reckoned in watts 
per tb per 100 cycles of magnetization per second and at a maximum 
flux density of 2500 C.G.S. units should also be determined. 

The experimental examination of a transformer involves 
the measurement of the efficiency, the iron core loss, and the 
secondary drop; also certain tests as to insulation and 
heating, and finally an examination of the relative 
phase position and graphic form of the various periodic quanti- 
ties, currents and electromotive forces taking place in the trans- 
former. The efficiency is best determined by the employment 

of a properly constructed 
wattmeter (see Watt- 
meter). The trans- 
former T (fig. 5) should 
be so arranged that, if a 
constant potential trans- 
former, it is supplied 
with its normal working 
pressure at the primary 
side and with a load 
which can be varied, and 
which is obtained either 
by incandescent lamps, L, or resistances in the secondary 
circuit. A wattmeter, W, should be placed with its series 
coil, Se, in the primary circuit of the transformer, and its

shunt coil, Sh, either across the primary mains in series, 
with a suitable non-inductive resistance, or connected to the 
secondary circuit of another transformer, T 1 , called an 
auxiliary transformer y having its primary terminals connected 
to those of the transformer under test. In the latter case one 
or more incandescent lamps, L, may be connected in series 
with the shunt coil of the wattmeter so as to regulate the 
current passing through it. The current through the series 
coil of the wattmeter is then the same as the current through the 
primary circuit of the transformer under test, and the current 
through the shunt coil of the wattmeter is in step with, and 
proportional to, the primary voltage of the transformer. Hence 
the wattmeter reading is proportional to the mean power given 
up to the transformer. The wattmeter can be standardized and 
its scale reading interpreted by replacing the transformer under 
test by a non-inductive resistance or series of lamps, the power 
absorption of which is measured by the product of the amperes 
and volts supplied to it. In the secondary circuit of the trans- 
former is placed another wattmeter of a similar kind, or, if the 
load on the secondary circuit is non-inductive, the secondary 
voltage and the secondary current can be measured with a 
proper alternating current ammeter, As, and voltmeter, V2, and 
the product of these readings taken as a measure of the power 
given out by the transformer. The ratio of the powers, namely, 
that given out in the external secondary circuit and that taken 
in by the primary circuit, is the efficiency of the transformer. 

In testing large transformers, when it is inconvenient to load up 
the secondary circuit to the full load, a close approximation to the 
power taken up at any assumed secondary load can be obtained by 
adding to the value of this secondary load, measured in watts, the 
iron core loss of the transformer, measured at no load, and the copper 
losses calculated from the measured copper resistances when the 
transformer is hot. Thus, if C is the iron core loss in watts, measured 
on open secondary circuit, that is to say, is the power given to the 
transformer at normal frequency and primary voltage, and if Ri 
and R 2 are the primary and secondary circuit resistances when the 
transformer has the temperature it would have after running at 
full load for two or three hours, then the efficiency can be calculated 
as follows : Let O be the nominal value of the full secondary output 
of the transformer in watts, Vi and V2 the terminal voltages on the 
primary and secondary side, Ni and N 2 the number of turns, and Ai 
and A 2 the currents for the two circuits; then O/V2 is the full load 
secondary current measured in amperes, and N 2 Ni multiplied by 
O/V2 is to a sufficient approximation the value of the corresponding 
primary current. Hence CRa/W is the watts lost in the secondary 
circuit due to copper resistance, and 2 RiN 2 2 /V 2 2 Ni 2 is the corre- 
sponding loss in the primary circuit. Hence the total power loss 
in the transformer ( = L) is such that 
O 2 /NA 2 O 2 

L " C + W R2 + Wj V? Rl = C + ( R2 + Rxa*)OVW. 
Therefore the power given up to the transformer is O+L, and the 
efficiency is the fraction 0/(0+L) expressed as a percentage. In 
this manner the efficiency can be determined with a considerable 
degree of accuracy in the case of large transformers without actually 
loading up the secondary circuit. The secondary drop, however, 
can only be measured by loading the transformer up to full load, 
and, while the primary voltage is kept constant, measuring the 
potential difference of the secondary terminals, and comparing it 
with the same difference when the transformer is not loaded. Another 
method of testing large transformers at full load without supplying 
the actual power is by W. E. Snmpner's differential method, which 
can be done when two equal transformers are available (see Fleming, 
Handbook for the Electrical Laboratory and Testing Room, ii. 602). 

No test of a transformer is complete which does not comprise 
some investigation of the " ageing " of the core. The slow 
changes which take place in the hysteretic quality . . 
of iron when heated, in the case of certain brands, 
give rise to a time-increase in iron core loss. Hence a trans- 
former which has a core loss, say, of 300 watts when new, may, 
unless the iron is well chosen, have its core loss increased from 
50 to 300% by a few months' use. In some cases specifications 
for transformers include fines and deductions from price for any 
such increase; but there has in this respect been great improve- 
ment in the manufacture of iron for magnetic purposes, and 
makers are now able to obtain supplies of good magnetic iron 
or steel with non-ageing qualities. It is always desirable, how- 
ever, that in the case of large sub-station transformers tests 
should be made at intervals to discover whether the core loss 



176 



TRANSFORMERS 



has increased by ageing. If so, it may mean a very considerable 
increase in the cost of magnetizing power. Consider the case 
of a 30-kilowatt transformer connected to the mains all the year 
round; the normal core loss of such a transformer should be 
about 300 watts, and therefore, since there are 8760 hours in 
the year, the total annual energy dissipated in the core should 
be 2628 kilowatt hours. Reckoning the value of this electric 
energy at only one penny per unit, the core loss costs £10, 19s. 
per annum. If the core loss becomes doubled, it means an 
additional annual expenditure of nearly £11. Since the cost 
of such a transformer would not exceed £100, it follows that it 
would be economical to replace it by a new one rather than 
continue to work it at its enhanced core loss. 

In Great Britain the sheet steel or iron alloy used for the trans- 
former cores is usually furnished to specifications which state the 
maximum hysteresis loss to be allowed in it in watts per lb 
(avoirdupois) at a frequency of 50, and at a maximum Mux-density 
during the cycle of aooo C.G.S. units. When plates having a thick- 
ness/ mils are made up into a transformer core, the total energy 
loss in the core due to hysteresis and eddy current loss when worked 
at a frequency n and a maximum flux-density during the cycle B 
is given by the empirical formulae 

T = •oo32»B 1 '"io- J7 + (inhaler 1 *, 

where T stands for the loss per cubic centimetre, and Ti for the 
same in watts per pound of iron core, B for the maximum flux- 
density in lines per square centimetre, and Bi for the same in lines 
per square inch, t for the thickness of the^ plates in thousandths 
of an inch (mils), and h for the same in inches. The hysteresis 
loss varies as some power near to i-6 of the maximum flux-density 
during the cycle as shown by Steinmetz (see Electromagnetism). 
Since the hysteresis loss vanes as the I -6th power of the maximum 
flux-density during the cycle (B max.), the advantages of a low 
flux-density are evident. An excessively low flux-density increases, 
however, the cost of the core and the copper by increasing the size 
of the transformer. If the form factor (/) of the primary voltage 
curve is known, then the maximum value of the flux-density in the 
core can always be calculated from the formula B=Ei^/wSNi, 
where E is the R.M.S. value of the primary voltage, Ni the primary 
turns, S the section of the core, and n the frequency. 

The study of the processes taking place in the core and circuits 
of a transformer have been greatly facilitated in recent years by 
Curve the improvements made in methods of observing and 
Tracing, recording the variation of periodic currents and 
electromotive forces. The original method, due to Joubert, 
was greatly improved and employed by Ryan, Bell, Duncan 
and Hutchinson, Fleming, Hopkinson and Rosa, Callendar 
and Lyle; but the most important improvement was the 
introduction and invention of the oscillograph by Blondel, 
subsequently improved by Duddell, and also of the ondograph 
of Hospitalier (see Oscillograph). This instrument enables 
us, as it were, to look inside a transformer, for "which it, in fact, 
performs the same function that a steam engine indicator does 
for the steam cylinder. 1 Delineating in this way the curves 
of primary and secondary current and primary and secondary 
electromotive forces, we get the following result: Whatever 
may he the form of the curve of primary terminal potential 
difference, or primary voltage, tjiat of the secondary voltage 
or terminal potential difference is an almost exact copy, but 

displaced 180 in phase. Hence 
the alternating current trans- 
former reproduces on its second- 
ary terminals all the variations 
of potential on the primary, 
but changed in scale. The curve 
of primary current when the

secondary side, then the primary current curve comes more into 
step with the primary voltage curve. The secondary current 
curve, if the secondary load is non-inductive, is in step with the 
secondary voltage curve (fig. 7).. These transformer diagrams 
yield much information as to the nature of the operations 
proceeding in the transformer. , 

The form of the curve of primary current at no secondary load is 
a consequence of the hysteresis of the iron, combined with the fact 
that the form of the core flux-density curves of the transformer 
is always not far removed from a simple sine curve. If e\ is at any 
moment the electromotive force, i\ the current on the primary 
circuit, and 61 is the flux-density in the core, then we have the 
fundamental relation ei = Ri*i-}-SNi dbi/dt, where Ri is the re- 
sistance of the primary, and Ni the number of turns, and S is 
the cross-section of the core. In all modern closed circuit trans- 
formers the quantity Riii is very small compared with the quantity 
SNdb/dt except at one instant during the phase, and in taking the 
integral of the above equation, viz. in finding the value of fe\dt, 
the integral of the first term on the right-hand side may be 
neglected in comparison with the second. Hence we have approxi- 
mately pi = (SNi)-yeidt. In other words, the value of the flux- 
density in the core is obtained by integrating the area of the primary 
voltage curve. In so doing the integration must be started from 
the time point through which passes the ordinate bisecting the 
area of the primary voltage curve. When any curve is formed 
such that its ordinate y is the integral of the area of another curve, 
viz. y=fyWx, the first curve is always smoother and more regular 
in form than the second. Hence the process above described 
when applied to a complex periodic curve, which can by Fourier's 
theorem be resolved^ into a series of simple periodic curves, results 
in a relative reduction of the magnitude of the higher harmonics 
compared with the funda- 
mental term, and hence a 
wiping out of the minor 
irregularities of the curve. 
In actual practice the curve 
of electromotive force of 
alternators can be quite 
sufficiently reproduced by 
employing three terms of 
the expansion, viz. the first 
three odd harmonics, and 
the resulting flux-density 
curve is always very nearly 
a simple sine curve. 

We have then the follow-

assuming that the hysteresis curve of the iron is given, set out In terms 
of flux-density and ampere-turns per centimetre, and also the form of 
the curve of primary electromotive force. Let the time base line be 
divided up into equal small elements. Through any selected point 
draw a line perpendicular to the base line. Bisect the area enclosed 
by the curve representing the half wave of primary electromotive 
force and the base line by another perpendicular. Integrate the 
area enclosed between the electromotive force cnrve and these 
two perpendicular lines and the base. Lastly, set up a length on 
the last perpendicular equal to the value of this area divided by 
the product of the cross-section of the core and the number of 
primary turns. The resulting value will be the core flux-density b 
at the phase instant corresponding. Look out on the hysteresis 
loop the same flux-density value, and corresponding to it will be 
found two values of the magnetizing force in ampere-turns per 
centimetre, one the* value for increasing flux-density and one for 
decreasing. An inspection of the position of the point of time 
selected on the time line will at once show which of these to select. 
Divide that value of the ampere-turns per centimetre by the product 
of the values of the primary turns and the mean length of the mag- 
netic circuit of the core of the transformer, and the result gives the 
value of the primary current of the transformer. This can be set 
up to scale on the perpendicular through the time instant selected. 
Hence, given the form of the primary electromotive force curve 
and that of the hysteresis loop of the iron^ we can draw the curves 
representing the changes of flux-density in the core and that of 
the corresponding primary current, and thus predict the root- 
mean-square value of the magnetizing current of the transformer. 
It is therefore possible, when given the primary electromotive 
force curve and the hysteresis curve of the iron, to predetermine 
the curves depicting all the other variables of the transformer, 
provided that the magnetic leakage is negligible. 

The elementary theory of the closed iron circuit transformer may 
be stated as follows: Let Ni, Nj be the turns on the primary and 
secondary circuits, Ri and R2 the resistances, S the nj eaeBtary 
section of the core, and fa and fa the co-instantaneous Tneory 
values of the flux-density justinside^ the primary and ^* 

secondary windings. Then, if i\ and h and e\ and e% are the primary 



TRANSFORMERS 



177 



and secondary currents and potential differences at the same instant, 
these quantities are connected by the equations 

ei-'Rii+SNrgj 1 , <?a = SNa^j 2 -R 2 t2. 

Hence, if fa = fa, and if Rin is negligible in comparison^Jwith 
SNidb/dt, and i — o t that is, if the secondary circuit is open, then 
e,/e2 = Ni/N2, or the transformation ratio is simply the ratio of the 
windings. This, however, is not the case if fa and fa have not the 
same value; in other words, if there is magnetic leakage. If the 
magnetic leakage cab be neglected, then the resultant magnetizing 
force, and therefore the iron core loss, is constant at all loads. 
Accordingly, the relation between the primary current (ii), the 
secondary current fe), and the magnetizing current (t), or primary 
current at^ no load, is given by the equation Niti — Nj*a = Ni*. 
Then, writing b for the instantaneous value of the flux-density 
in the core, everywhere supposed to be the same, we arrive at the 
identity 

^'i = ^-f.(Ri*i 2 +R2* 2 )+S^(Nin-N 2 i 2 ). 

This equation merely expresses^ the fact that the power put into 
the transformer at any instant is equal to the power given out on 
the secondary side together with the power dissipated by the 
copper losses and the constant iron core loss. 

The efficiency of a transformer at any load is the ratio of the 
mean value, during the period, of the product eiii to that of the 
product ah. The efficiency of an alternating current transformer 
is a function of the form of the primary electromotive force curve. 
Experiment has shown l that if a transformer is tested for efficiency 
on various alternators having electromotive force curves of different 
forms, the efficiency values found at the same secondary load are 
not identical, those being highest which belong to the alternator 
with the most peaked curve of electromotive force, that is, the 
curve having the largest form factor. ^This is a consequence of the 
fact that the hysteresis loss in the iron depends upon the manner 
in which the magnetization (or what here comes to the same thing, 
the flux-density in the core) is allowed to change. If the primary 
electromotive force curve has the form of a high peak, or runs up 
suddenly to a large maximum value, the flux-density curve will be 
more square-shouldered than when the voltage curve has a lower 
form factor. The hysteresis loss in the iron is less when the magneti- 
zation changes its sign somewhat suddenly Jthan when it does so 
more gradually. In other words, a diminution in the formfactor 
of the core flux-density curve implies a diminished hysteresis loss. 
The variation in core loss in transformers when tested on various 
forms of commercial alternator may amount to as much as 10%. 
Hence, in recording the results of efficiency tests of alternating 
current transformers, it is always necessary to specify the form 
of the curve of primary electromotive force. The power factor 
of the transformer or ratio of the true power absorption at no load, 
to the product of the R.M.S. values of the primary current and 
voltage, and also the secondary drop of the transformer, vary with 
the form factor of the primary voltage curve, being also both in- 
creased by increasing the form factor. Hence there is a slight 
advantage in working alternating current transformers off an 
alternator giving a rather peaked or high maximum value electro- 
motive force curve. This, however is disadvantageous in other 
ways, as it puts a greater strain upon the insulation of the trans- 
former and cables. At one time a controversy arose as to the 
relative merits of closed and open magnetic circuit transformers. 
It was, however, shown by tests made by Fleming and by Ayrton 
on Swinburne's " Hedgehog " transformers, having a straight core 
of iron wires bristling out at each end, that for equal secondary 
outputs, as regards efficiency, open as compared with closed mag- 
netic circuit transformers had no advantage, whilst, owing to the 
smaller power factor and consequent large R.M.S. value of the 
magnetizing current, the former type had many disadvantages 
(see Fleming, " Experimental Researches on Alternate Current 
Transformers," Journ. Inst. Elec. Eng., 1892). 

The discussion of the theory ^ of the transformer is not quite so 
simple when magnetic leakage is taken into account. In all cases 
Magnetic a cert ^ n proportion of the magnetic flux linked with 
Leakage Q e primary circuit is not linked with the secondary 
circuit, and the difference is called the magnetic leakage. 
This magnetic leakage constitutes a wasted flux which is non- 
effective in producing secondary electromotive force. It increases 
with the secondary current, and can be delineated by a curve on 
the transformer diagram in the following manner. The curves of 
primary and secondary electromotive force, or terminal potential 
difference and current, are determined experimentally, and then 
two curves are plotted on the same diagram which represent the 
variation of («i — Ri*i)/Ni and (e 2 +R 2 i 2 )/N 2 ; these will represent 
the time differentials of the total magnetic fluxes S&f and Sfa linked 
respectively with the primary and secondary T circuits. The above 
curves are then progressively integrated, starting from the time

point through which passes the ordinate bisecting the area of each 
half wave, and the resulting curves plotted to express by their 
ordinates Sfa and Sfa. A curve is then plotted whose ordinates 
are the differences Sfa—Sfat and this is the curve of magnetic 
leakage. 

The existence of magnetic leakage can be proved experimentally 
by a method due to Mordey, by placing a pair of thermometers, 
one of mercury and the other of alcohol, in the centre of the core 
aperture. If there is a magnetic leakage, the mercury bulb is 
heated not only by radiant heat, but by eddy currents set up in 
the mercury, and its rise is therefore greater than that of the alcohol 
thermometer. The leakage is also determined by observing the 
secondary voltage drop between full load and no load, and de- 
ducting from it the part due to copper resistance; the remainder 
is the drop due to leakage. Thus if V 2 is the secondary voltage 
on open circuit, and V 2 2 that when a current A 2 is taken out of 
the transformer, the leakage drop v is given by the equation 

v = (V 2 -V 2 i)-{R 2 A 2 +R 1 A 2 (N 2 /Ni) 2 }. 

The term in the large bracket expresses the drop in secondary 
voltage due to the copper resistance of the primary and secondary 
circuits. 

In drawing up a specification for an alternating current trans- 
former, it is necessary to specify that the maximum secondary 
drop between full and no load to be allowed shall not exceed a 
certain value, say 2 % of the no-load secondary voltage ; also that 
the iron core loss as a percentage of the full secondary output 
shall not exceed a value, say, of 1 % after six months' normal work. 

In the design of large transformers one of the chief points 
for attention is the arrangement for dissipating the heat gene- 
rated in their mass by the copper and iron losses. 
For every watt expended in the core and circuit, a o^^ rmer 
surface of 3 to 4 sq. in. must be allowed, so that the 
heat may be dissipated. In large transformers it is usual to 
employ some means of producing a current of air through the 
core to ventilate it. In these, called air-blast transformers, 
apertures are left in the core by means of which the cooling air 
can reach the interior portions. This air is driven through the 
core by a fan actuated by an alternating current motor, which 
does not, however, take up power to a greater extent than about 
i or iV% of the full output of the transformer, and well repays 
the outlay. 

In some cases transformers are oil-insulated, that is to say, in- 
cluded in a cast-iron box which is filled in with a heavy insulating 
oil. For this purpose an oil must be selected free from mineral 
acids and water: it should be heated to a high temperature 
before use, and tested for dielectric strength by observing the 
voltage required to create a spark between metal balls immersed

Polyphase Transformers are appliances of 
similar construction to the single-phase trans- 
formers already described, but modified 
so as to enable them to transform^ two or 
more phase-related primary alternating cur- 
rents into similar secondary currents. Thus, 
a three-phase transformer may be constructed 
with a core, as shown in fig ; 8. Each core 
leg is surrounded with a primary coil, and 
these are joined up either in star or delta 
fashion, and connected to the three or four *-<- 
line wires. The secondary circuits are then *" 

connected in a similar fashion to three or ' ig ig— 

four secondary lines. In the case of two- I \ I 2

employed in each branch, but with two-phase three-wire supply, two- 
phase transformers must be supplied. 

Phase Transformers are arrangements of static or rotary trans- 
formers intended to transform single-phase alternating currents into 
polyphase currents. An important system of phase transformation 
has been described by C. F. Scott. 1 It is known that if two alternat- 
ing electromotive forces differing in phase are connected in series, 
the resulting electromotive force will in general differ in phase and 
value from either of the components. Thus, if two alternating 
electromotive forces differing 90 in phase, and having magnitudes 
in the ratio of 1 : V3, are connected in series, the resulting electro- 
motive force will have a magnitude represented by 2, and the 
three can be represented by the sides of a triangle which is half 
an equilateral triangle. If then a two-phase alternator, D (fig. 9), 

provides two-phase cur- 
rents, and if the two circuits 
are connected, as shown, to 
a pair of single-phase trans- 
formers, Ti and Tj, we can 
obtain three-phase alter- 
nating currents from the ar- 
rangement. The primaries 
of both transformers are 
the same. The secondary 
circuit of one transformer, 
Tj, has, say, 100 turns, and 
a connexion is made to its 
middle point O, and this is 
connected to the secondary 
of the other transformer 
which has 87 ( = 50 V 3) 
turns. From the points 
A, B, C we can then tap off 
three-phase alternating cur- 
rents. The advantages of 
the Scott system are that 
we can transform two-phase 
alternating currents into 
three-phase for transmis- 
sion, and then by a similar 
arrangement retransform

phase Currents. economy of 25% in copper 

is effected, for instead of 
four transmission lines we have only three. The system adapts itself 
for the transmission of currents both for power in driving three-phase 
motors and for working incandescent lamps. A somewhat similar 
system has been designed by C. P. Steinmetz for producing three- 
phase currents from single-phase (see Electrician, xliii. 236). When 
a number^ of alternating electromotive forces are maintained in 
a closed circuit, the sum of all must be zero, and may be repre- 
sented by the sides of a closed polygon. The fundamental principle 
of Mr Steinmetz's invention consists in so choosing the number 
of these electromotive forces that the polygon must remain stable. 
Thus, if three single-phase alternators are driven independently 
at constant speed and excitation, and if they are joined in series, 
then three wires led away from the junction points will provide 
three-phase currents to a system from which lamps and motors

Reference must be made to the continuous current transformer. 
The conversion of a continuous current supplied, say, at 100 volts,

formers, The combination is called a motor-dynamo set, and each 
machine preserves its own identity and peculiarity. 
The same result may, however, be accomplished by winding two 
separate armature circuits on one iron core, and furnishing each 
with its own commutator. The two circuits are interlaced or wound 
on together. An arrangement of this kind constitutes a rotatory 
or rotary transformer, or continuous current transformer. It has 
the advantage of greater cheapness and efficiency, because one field 
magnet serves for both armature windings, and there is only one 
armature core and one pair of bearings; moreover, no shift or lead 
°r t il e brushes is required at various loads. The armature reactions 
of the two circuits annul each other. Machines of this description 
are self-starting, and can be constructed to take in primary current 
at high pressures, say 1000 to 2000 volts, and yield another larger 
current of much lower voltage, say 100 or 150 volts, for use with 
electric lamps. They are used in connexion with public electric 
supply by continuous current in many places. 

Another important class of rotatory transformer is that also 
called a rotatory converter, by means of which continuous current 
is translated into alternating current of one-, two- or three-phase,

stood by considering the simple cas e of a Gramme ring armature

(see Dynamo) having, in addition to its commutator, a pair of in- 
sulated rings on its shaft connected with opposite ends of the arma- 
ture winding (fig. 10). If such a ring is placed in a bipole field 
magnet, and if a pair of brushes make contact with the commutator 
C and another pair with the two rings called slip rings, Si S2, and 
if continuous current at a constant voltage is supplied to the com- 
mutator side, then the armature will begin to revolve in the field, 
and from the brushes in contact with the slip rings we can draw off 
an alternating current. This reaches its maximum value when 
the points of contact of the rings with the armature circuit pass 
the axis of commutation, or line at right angles to the direction 
of the magnetic field, for it has at this moment a value which is 
double the steady value of the continuous current being poured 
into the armature. The_ maximum value of the electromotive 
force creating this alternating current is nearly equal to the electro- 
motive force on the continuous current side. Hence if A is the 
maximum value of the continuous current put into the armature 
and V is the value of the brush potential difference on the con- 
tinuous current side, then 2A is the maximum value of the out- 
coming alternating current and V is the maximum value of its 
voltage. Hence^ 2AV/2=AV is the maximum value of the out- 
coming alternating current 
power, and if we neglect the 
loss in the armature forthe 
moment, the power given 
out is equal to the power 
put in. Hence, t assuming 
a simple harmonic law 01 
variation, the effective value 
of the alternating current 
voltage is V/V2, and that 
of the alternating current 
is 2AV2. This conclusion ~ 
follows at once from the fact 
that the mean value of the 
square of a sine function is 
half its maximum value, and 
hence the R.M.S. value is 
1/V2 times the maximum 

value. The outcoming alternating current has its zero value at the 
instart when the ends of the diameter of the axis to which the 
rings are connected are in the direction of the magnetic field 
of the transformer. Hence the power output on the alternating 
current side varies from a maximum value AV to zero. The 
rotatory transformer thus absorbs continuous current power 
and emits it in a periodic form; accordingly, there is a continual 
storage and emission of energy by the armature, and therefore 
its kinetic energy is periodically varying during the phase. 
The armature is also creating a back-electromotive force which 
acts at some instants against the voltage driving the^ current 
into the armature and at others is creating an electromotive force 
that assists the external impressed voltage in driving a current 
through the alternating current side. If we put on another pair 
of insulated rings and connect them to points of the insulated 
diameter at right angles to the points of connexion of the first pair 
of rings, we can draw off another alternating current, the phase 
of which differs 90 from that of the first. Similarly, if we provide 
three rings connected to points removed 120 apart on the armature 
circuit, we can tap off a three-phase alternating current. 

Returning to the case of -the single-phase rotatory transformer, 
we may notice that at the instant when the outcoming alternating 
current is zero the armature is wholly engaged in absorbing power 
and is acting entirely as a motor. When the alternating current 
is a maximum, the armature on the other hand is acting as a gene- 
rator and adds current to the current put into it. The ratio between 
the potential difference of the brushes on the continuous current 
side and the root-mcan-square or effective value of the voltage 
between any pair of rings on the alternating current side is called 
the transformation ratio of the converter. 

The following table, taken from a paper upon rotatory converters 
by S. P. Thompson (Proc. Inst. Elec. Eng., November 1898), gives 
the voltage ratio or conversion ratio in the case of various forms 
of rotatory transformer: —

It is obvious that the same results of conversion can be obtained 
by coupling together two separate machines on the same shaft; 
thus we might obtain a single-phase alternating current from a 
continuous current by coupling together mechanically a continuous 
current motor and a single-phase alternator.^ Such a combination 
is generally called a motor-dynamo. In this case there are two 
field magnets and two separate armatures, and the hysteresis eddy 
current and copper losses are all in duplicate. If, however, the same 
armature winding is made to serve both purposes, the resulting 
machine is called a rotatory or rotary converter. In the former 
combination the brushes of the continuous current part require 
to be set with the usual lead or lag according as that part is 
generator or motor, but in the latter the armature reactions nearly 
annul each other, and lead or lag is no longer necessary. 

Rectifiers are devices for transforming an alternating (gener- 
ally single-phase) current into a continuous but pulsatory 
current. They may shortly be described as appli- 
ances for separating out each alternate current flux 
in an alternating current. An immense number of more or 
less imperfect methods of doing this have been proposed, and 
here we shall describe two which may be called respectively the 
mechanical and the electrolytic methods. Of the first class a 
good example is the Ferranti rectifier (fig. 1 1). This consists of a 
synchronous alternating current motor which is started up and 
driven in step with the alternator supplying the current. The 







Fig. 11. — Ferranti Rectifier. 

motor drives a commutator of insulated segments, each alternate 
segment being connected to two insulated rings, against which 



press a pair of brushes. Another pair of brushes, so adjusted 
as to be in contact simultaneously with a pair of adjacent 
commutator segments, are in connexion with the alternator 
supplying the current to be commutated. The insulated rings 
are in connexion with the external circuit. It will easily be 
seen that when the commutator revolves at proper speed the 
currents delivered from the insulated rings are unidirectional. 
The Ferranti rectifier is much employed for rectifying alter- 
nating current for arc lighting purposes. With this object 
it is associated with a constant current transformer which 
converts alternating current supplied at constant potential 
to one supplied at constant current. This is achieved by 
taking advantage of the repulsive force existing between the 
primary and secondary circuits of a transformer. These are 
wound separately, and so balanced that any increase in the 
current presses them away from each other and so reduces the 
secondary current to normal value. Such an appliance is useful 
for rectifying currents up to 10 or 15 amperes. 

The electrolytic rectifier is based upon the fact that if plates 
of aluminium and carbon are placed in an electrolyte, say a 
solution of alum or dilute acids which yield oxygen on electro- 
lysis, it is found that a current can be sent through the liquid 
from the carbon to the aluminium, but that great counter- 
electromotive force is created to a current in the opposite direc- 
tion. Gratz and Pollak (Elektrotechnische Zeilschrifl, 1897, 25, 
P« 359)? taking advantage of this fact, have constructed a 
rectifying arrangement by arranging two series of carbon 
aluminium (CA1) cells with alum or hydro-potassic phosphate 
solution as electrolyte. In one set the order of the plates is 
(CA1), (CA1), &c, and in the other series (A1C), (A1C), counting 
from the same end. These series being connected in parallel, 
it follows that if an alternating current is sent through the parallel 
series all the currents in one direction pass through one battery 
and all those in the opposite direction through the other. Thus 
the constituents of the alternating current are separated out. 
By using very large cells so as to reduce the internal resistance, 
an efficiency of 95 % is said to be obtained. 

There are many points in the operation of the electrolytic rectifier 
which have as yet been imperfectly explained. The action of the 
aluminium electrolytic rectifier, consisting as it does r 
of an aluminium plate and a lead or carbon plate ^^ y ^ l t c 
placed in an # aqueous electrolyte, is to oppose a % ect l^ e ^ m 
great obstruction to a current passing out of the 
aluminium plate, but little or no obstruction to the^ current passing 
into the aluminium plate, especially if the aluminium has been 
subjected to a previous treatment called formation. This unilateral 
conductivity is dependent on a certain voltage or potential differ- 
ence between the plates not being exceeded^ but within these 
limits a plate of carbon and aluminium placed in a solution, say of 
hydro-sodic phosphate, acts as an electrical valve, allowing current 
to pass in one direction but not in another. An examination of 
the aluminium plate after it has been so used shows that its appear- 
ance has changed and that its surface is covered by a thin film, 
the thickness of which varies with the electrolyte and the time of 
formation. After a certain period of use this film is seen as a grey, 
dull coating traversed by dark lines. It is impossible that the 
unilateral conductivity can be due to a true electrolytic polariza- 
tion, because we know of no polarization of this latter kind which 
exceeds three volts, and the film can be made to resist the flow of 
a current under an electromotive force of 140 to 200 volts. The 
resistance of this film has been measured and found to be very 
high, so high as to be practically an insulation. Light was thrown 
upon the subject by F. Kohlrausch's discovery of the polarization 
capacity of metallic electrodes, and this discovery was applied to 
develop the theory of the aluminium cell by Stremtz (1888), Scott 
(1899) and others. 

This theory was expounded by K. Norden {Electrician, xlyiii. 
107). According to this view, the deposit covering the aluminium 
electrode forms the dielectric of a condenser. One plate of the 
condenser is formed by the aluminium plate and the other by an 
opposite layer of electrically-charged ions in the electrolyte. The 
dielectric film on the aluminium having been formed, the electro- 
motive force of the circuit then charges tjie resulting condenser to 
the value of its own voltage, but immediately the impressed electro- 
motive force is removed this condenser discharges itself. This con- 
denser theory receives support from the behaviour of the aluminium 
cell when placed in the circuit of an alternating current dynamo, 
for it is found that in these circumstances the current through the 
cell is in advance in phase of the difference of potential. The ques- 
tion then arises, What is the nature of this insulating film? The 



i8o 



TRANSFORMERS 



first discoverer of the phenomenon (Buff) considered it to consist 
of silicon. Later Professor Beetz disproved this by experiment, 
and, with many others, assumed that a sub-oxide of aluminium 
was formed; but this has never been demonstrated in a satisfactory 
manner. By forming a sufficient quantity of the film Dr K. Norden 
was able to obtain sufficient of the material to make a chemical 
analysis, and this^ revealed the fact that it consists of normal 
aluminium hydroxide, AUCOHJb. 

According to the facts above stated, one wave of the alternating 
current produces the insulating film by converting the surface of 
the aluminium into hydroxide, practically, therefore, blocking its 
own path very quickly by the creation of this film. If, then, the 
electromotive force reverses its direction the current immediately 
flows. According to Dr Norden, the rapid removal of the insulat- 
ing film is due to the action of the electrolyte corroding or dis- 
solving the weak points in the coating and thus breaking down its 
insulating power. The insulating film is therefore a conductor in 
one direction, but when the current is reversed and flows out of the 
aluminium plate the insulating film is renewed and is continually 
being repaired and kept in order. _ Thus different electrolytes 
yield aluminium valves having very different efficiencies. 

Rectifying cells have been made by Pollak which will bear a 
voltage of over 140 volts, and which are said to have an efficiency 
of 75%. The plates, however, must be removed when not in use, 
otherwise the film of hydroxide is destroyed by the electrolyte. 
One great practical difficulty in connexion with the aluminium 
rectifier is the tendency to heat in working. 

The historical development of the discovery of this unilateral 
conductivity of an electrolytic cell with an aluminium electrode 
is as follows. The effect was first noticed by Buff in 1857, but was 
not applied technically until 1874, when Ducretet employed it in 
telegraphy. Beret in 1877 and Streintz in 1887 discussed the 
theory of the cell and sought for an explanation. In 1891 Hutin 
and Leblanc, in their study of alternating current, showed its uses 
in rectifying an alternating current. Pollak and Gratz laboured to 
give it a practically useful form. Pollak took out patents in 1895, 
and made a communication to the Academy of Sciences in Paris 
in June 1897; and Gratz presented a memoir at a meeting of the 
German Association _ of Electrochemists in Munich in 1897. M. 
Blondin has summarized all the workso far done on the aluminium 
rectifier in two articles in L'Eclairage Hectrique (1898), xiv. 293, 
and xxviii. 117 (1901). The choice of an electrolyte is of great 
importance. Buff, Ducretet and Gratz employed dilute sulphuric 
acid,_ and the greatest difference of potential which could then be 
applied to the cell without breaking down its insulation in one 
direction was 20 volts. Pollak in 1896 found that when aqueous 
solutions of alkaline salts were used, and when the aluminium 
was subjected to a preliminary formation, the back electromotive 
force or what is equivalent to it could be raised to 140 or 200 volts. 
Pollak found that the best results were given by the use of 
phosphate of potassium or sodium. It appears, therefore, that the 
ions of K or Na effect the breaking down of the film of aluminium 
hydroxide more quickly than the ion of hydrogen. The practical 
form of aluminium rectifier, according to Pollak, consists of plates 
of thick aluminium and lead placed in a large deep glass vessel filled 
with a solution of potassium hydrogen phosphate. 

In 1899 Albert Nodon of Paris began experimenting with an 
electric rectifier which is now on a commercial footing. It is 

known as the Nodon electric valve, and it is claimed 
Ka/ve* t ^ iat k ^ £i ve an efficiency of 75 to 80% when used 

to transform single or polyphase currents into 
continuous currents. In the form used for transforming single- 
phase currents the valve is made up of 4 cells, each consisting 
of an iron cylinder with an insulating plug at the bottom through 
which is passed a cylinder formed of an alloy of zinc and

aluminium. This cylinder is concentric with the iron tube 
and provided with a terminal at the lower end. The cell is filled 
with a saturated solution of ammonium phosphate, and a non- 
conducting shielding tube can be slid over the aluminium 
electrode to alter the exposed area. 

The valve is shown in section in fig. 12, and the 4 cells are arranged 
in a Wheatstone's Bridge fashion, as shown in fig. 13. A and A 1 
are the terminals to which the alternating current is supplied, 
C and C 1 the terminals from which the continuous current is drawn, 
off. The electrolytic actions which take place in the cells are as" 
follows: When the alternating current passes in the positive direction 
from the zinc-aluminium cylinder to the iron cylinder there is 
formed instantly on the former a film of aluminium hydroxide; 
this film, presenting an enormous resistance, opposes the passage of 
the current. On the other hand, if the current passes in the opposite 
direction the film is reduced instantly and the current now flows. 
When used with polyphase currents the valve comprises as many 
times two cells as there are wires in the distribution. The celfe 
must stand a pressure varying from 50 to 140 volts, and for higher 
pressures two or more valves in series are employed. 

The aluminium-iron electrolytic rectifier is not suitable for the 
rectification of very high frequency currents, because the chemical 
actions on which it depends involve a time element. v 
It was, however, discovered by J. A. Fleming that an ™ cvumor 
oscillation valve _ could be constructed for rectifying pfSSSteis 
electrical oscillations, as follows (see Proc. Roy, Soc. 
Lond.t 1905, 74, p. 476): In a glass bulb similar to that of an 
incandescent lamp a carbon filament is fixed. Around the carbon 
filament, but not touching it, is placed a cylinder of nickel con- 
nected to an external terminal by means of platinum wire sealed 
through the glass. If the carbon filament is made incandescent 
by an insulated battery (and for this purpose it is convenient to 
have the filament adjusted to be fully incandescent at a pressure 
of about 12 volts), then the space between the incandescent fila- 
ment and the embracing cylinder possesses a unilateral conductivity 
such that negative electricity can pass from the incandescent 
filament to the cylinder but not in the opposite direction. Hence 
if the negative terminal of the filament and the terminal attached 
to the cylinder are connected to an oscillation transformer (see 
Induction Coil) which supplies a high frequency alternating 
oscillatory current, the flow of electricity in one direction is cut 
out and the oscillatory current is therefore converted into a con- 
tinuous current. Such valves have been employed by Fleming 
in connexion with wireless telegraphy. Wehnelt discovered that 
if a platinum wire was covered with oxide of barium or any of the 
oxides of rare earth metals, it possessed in the same manner, when 
used in a valve of the above type, an even greater power than 
incandescent carbon. The explanation of this action is to he sought 
for in the fact that incandescent carbon in a vacuum or incandescent 
earthy oxides copiously emit negative electrons. 

A rectifier dependent upon the peculiar qualities of mercury 
vapour has been devised by Cooper-Hewitt for the transformation 
of polyphase currents into continuous 
currents. The three-phase transformer 
is made as follows: A large glass bulb 
(see fig. 14J has four iron electrodes sealed 
through the walls as positive electrodes 
and a negative electrode consisting of a 
pool of mercury in^ the bottom of the 
bulb connected with platinum wires 
sealed through the glass; the bulb is 
highly exhausted and contains only mer- 
cury vapour. The three iron electrodes 
are connected to the terminals of a star- 
connected polyphase transformer and one 
of them to the positive pole of a con- 
tinuous current starting current, the con- 
nexions being shown as in fig. 15. The 
mercury vapour is a non-conductor for 
low voltages, but if a sufficiently high 
voltage is placed on the mercury bulb 
by means of the continuous current it 
begins to conduct and if the three-phase 
current is then switched on the mercury 
vapour will allow the components of the 
three-phase current to pass when the 
mercury electrode is negative, not when 
it is positive. Hence for alternate cur- 
rent wave of the three-phase, supply is 
cut down and a continuous current can be 
drawn by the connexions as shown in 
fig. 1 5 B for the purposes of supplying secondary batteries, arc lamps, &c. 
Owing to the fact that the mercury vapour ceases to conduct 
when the electromotive force on it falls below a certain critical 
value the valve will not work with single-phase currents but will work 
with polyphase currents at all voltage from ioo^ to 1000 or more 
and can transform as much as 100 amperes. It is stated to have 
an efficiency of 88 to 89%. (See The Electrician, .1903, 50, p. 510.)

A mechanical polyphase rectifier or rotary devised by Bragstad 
and La Cour is described in Der Kaskadenumformer, by E. Arnold 
and J. L. La Cour, Stuttgart, 1904. It consists of a three-phase 
induction motor coupled direct to a continuous current dynamo, 
the armatures of the two machines being electrically connected 
so that the three-phase current created in the rotor of the induction

motor enters the continuous current armature and creates around 
it a rotary field. The connexions are such that the rotating field 
turns in a direction opposite to that in which the armature is 
turning, so that the field is stationary in space. From the con- 
tinuous current armature can therefore be drawn off a continuous 
current and the device acts as a transformer of three-phase alternat- 
ing current to a_ continuous current. 

The ordinary induction coil (q.v.) may be regarded as the trans- 
former for converting continuous current at low voltage into high 
voltage intermittent continuous current, but the difficulties of 
interrupting the primary current render it impossible to transform 
in this way more than a small amount of power. Where, however, 
high voltages are required, high potential transformers are used 
which are now built for the purpose of wireless telegraphy and the 
transformation of power to give secondary voltages up to 20,000, 
30,000 or 60,000 volts. Transformers have even been built to 
give secondary voltages of half a million volts capable of giving 
a 14 in. spark in air. These machines, however, must be regarded 
as more physical laboratory instruments than appliances for tech- 
nical work. For description of one such extra high potential trans- 
former see H. B. Smith, on " Experiments on Transformers for 
Very High Potentials," The Electrician (1904), 54, p. 358. A trans- 
former of this kind must invariably be an oil insulated transformer, 
as under extremely high voltage the air itself becomes a conductor 
and no solid insulator that can be put upon the wires is strong 
enough to stand the electric strain.

TRANSIT CIRCLE, or Meridian Circle, an instrument for 
observing the time of a star's passing the meridian, at the same 
time measuring its angular distance from the zenith. The idea 
of having an instrument (quadrant) fixed in the plane of the 
meridian occurred even to the ancient astronomers, and is 
mentioned by Ptolemy, but it was not carried into practice until 
Tycho Brahe constructed a large meridian quadrant. This 
instrument enabled the observer to determine simultaneously 
right ascension and declination, but it does not appear to have 
been much used for right ascension during the 17th century, the 
method of equal altitudes by portable quadrants or measures 
of the angular distance between stars with a sextant being 
preferred. These methods were, however, very inconvenient, 



which induced Romer to invent the transit instrument about 
1690. It consists of a horizontal axis in the direction east and 
west resting on firmly fixed supports, and having a telescope 
fixed at right angles to it, revolving freely in the plane of the 
meridian. At the same time Romer invented the altitude and 
azimuth instrument for measuring vertical and horizontal angles, 
and in 1704 he combined a vertical circle with his transit instru- 
ment, so as to determine both co-ordinates at the same time. 
This latter idea was, however, not adopted elsewhere, although 
the transit instrument soon came into universal use (the first 
one at Greenwich was mounted in 1721), and the mural quadrant 
continued till the end of the century to be employed for deter- 
mining declinations. The advantage of using a whole circle, 
as less liable to change its figure, and not requiring reversal in 
order to observe stars north of the zenith, was then again recog- 
nized by Ramsden, who also improved the method of reading 
off angles by means of a micrometer microscope as described 
below. The making of circles was shortly afterwards taken up 
by Troughton, who in 1806 constructed the first modern transit 
circle for Groombridge's observatory at Blackheath, but he 
afterwards abandoned the idea, and designed the mural circle 
to take the place of the mural quadrant. In the United King- 
dom the transit instrument and mural circle continued till the 
middle of the 19th century to be the principal instrument in 
observatories, the first transit circle constructed there being that 
at Greenwich (mounted in 1850) but on the continent the transit 
circle superseded them from the years 1818-1819, when two 
circles by Repsold and by Reichenbach were mounted at 
Gottingen, and one by Reichenbach at Konigsberg. 1 The firm 
of Repsold was for a number of years eclipsed by that of Pistor 
and Martins in Berlin, who furnished various observatories 
with first-class instruments, but since the death of. Martins the 
Repsolds have again taken the lead, and have of late years 
made many transit circles. The observatories of Harvard 
College (United States), Cambridge and Edinburgh have large 
circles by Troughton and Simms, who also made the Greenwich 
circle from the design of Airy. 2 

In the earliest transit instrument the telescope was not placed 
in the middle of the axis, but much nearer to one end, in order to 
prevent the axis from bending under the weight of the telescope. 
It is now always placed in the centre of the axis. The latter 
consists of one piece of brass or gun-metal with carefully turned 
cylindrical steel pivots at each end. _ Several recent instruments 
have been made entirely of steel ; which is much more rigid than 
brass. The centre of the axis is shaped like a cube, the sides 
of which form the basis of two cones which end in cylindrical 
parts. The pivots rest on V-shaped bearings, either let into the mas- 
sive stone or brick piers which support the instrument or attached 
to metal frameworks bolted on the tops of the piers. In order to 
relieve the pivots from the weight of the instrument, which would 
soon destroy their figure, the cylindrical part of each end of the axis 
is supported by a hook supplied with friction rollers, and suspended 
from a lever supported by the pier and counterbalanced so as to 
leave only about 10 lb pressure on each bearing. Near each 
end of the axis is attached a circle or wheel (generally of 3 or 3J ft. 
diameter) finely divided to 2' or 5' on a slip of silver let into the 
face of the circle near the circumference. The graduation is read 
off by means of microscopes, generally four for each circle at 90 
from each other, as by taking the mean of the four readings the 
eccentricity and the accidental errors of graduation are to a great 
extent eliminated.* In the earlier instruments by Pistor and Mar- 
tins the microscopes were fixed in holes drilled through the pier, 
but afterwards they let the piers be made narrower, so that the 
microscopes could be at the sides of them, attached to radial arms 
starting from near the bearings of the axis. This is preferable, 
as it allows of the temporary attachment of auxiliary microscopes 
for the purpose of investigating the errors of graduation of the 
circle, but the plan of the Repsolds and of Simms, to make the piers 
short and to let the microscopes and supports of the axis be carried 
by an iron framework, is better still, as no part of the circle is 

1 The most notable exception was the transit instrument and 
vertical circle of the Pulkovo observatory, specially designed by 
the elder Struve for fundamental determinations. 

2 This instrument differs in many particulars from others: the 
important principle of symmetry in all the parts (scrupulously 
followed in all others) is quite discarded; there is only one circle; 
and the instrument cannot be reversed. There is a similar instru- 
ment at the Cape observatory. 

3 On Reichenbach's circles there were verniers instead of micro- 
scopes, and they were attached to an alidade circle, the immovability 
of which was tested by a level.

exposed to radiation from the pier, which may cause strain and thereby 
change the angular distance between various parts of the circle. 
Each microscope is furnished with a micrometer screw, which 
moves a frame carrying a cross, or better two close parallel threads 
of spider's web, with which the distance of a division line from the 
centre of the field can be measured, the drum of the screw being 
divided to single seconds of tt^ arc (o-i"being estimated), while 
the number of revolutions fe&5 are counted by a kind of comb 
in the field of view. The fnf periodic errors of the screw

must be investigated and taken into account, and care must be 
taken that the microscopes are placed and kept at such a distance 
from the circle that one revolution will correspond to i', the excess 
or defect (error of run) being determined from^ time to time by 
measuring standard intervals of 2' or 5' on the circle. 

The telescope consists of two slightly conical tubes screwed to 
the central cube of the axis. It is of great importance that this 
connexion should be as firm and the tube as stiff as possible, 1 as 
the flexure of the tube will affect the declinations deduced from the 
observations. The flexure in the horizontal position of the tube 
may be determined by means of two collimators or telescopes 
placed horizontally in the meridian, north and south of the transit 
circle, with their object glasses towards it. If these are pointed 
on one another (through holes in thecentral tube of the telescope), 
so that the wire-crosses in their foci coincide, then the telescope, 
if pointed first to one and then to the other, will have described 
exactly 180 , and by reading off the circle each time the amount 
of flexure will be found. ^ M. Loewy has constructed a very ingenious 
apparatus 1 for determining the flexure in any zenith distance, 
but generally the observer of standard stars endeavours to eliminate 
the effect of flexure in one of the following ways: either the tube is 
so arranged that eyepiece and object-glass can be interchanged, 
whereby the mean of two observations of the same star in the two 
positions of the object-glass will be free from the effect of flexure, 
or a star is not only observed directly (in zenith distance Z) f but 
also by reflection from a mercury trough (in zenith distance 180 — Z), 
as the mean result of the Z.D. of the direct and reflection observa- 
tions, before and after reversing the instrument east and west, will 
only contain the terms of the flexure depending on sin 2Z, sin 4Z, &c. 
In order to raise the instrument a reversing carriage is provided 
which runs on rails between the piers, and on which the axis with 
circles and telescope can be raised by a kind of screw-jack, wheeled 
out from between the pierjs, turned exactly 180 , wheeled back, and 
gently lowered on its bearings. 

The eye end of the telescope has in a plane through the focus 
a number of vertical and one or two horizontal wires (spider lines). 
The former are used for observing the transits of the stars, each 
wire furnishing a separate result for the time of transit over the 
middle wire by adding or subtracting the known interval between 
the latter and the wire in question. The intervals are determined 
by observing the time taken by a star of known declination to pass 
from one wire to the other, the pole star being best on account of 
its slow^ motion. 8 Instead of vertical wires, the eye end may be 
fitted with Repsold's self-registering micrometer with one movable 
wire to follow the star (see Micrometer). The instrument is pro-

those on the Dorpat refractor (see Telescope). 

1 Comptes rendus, lxxxvii. 24. 

1 The transits are either observed by "eye and ear," counting 
the second beats of the clock and comparing the distance of the star 
from the wire at the last beat before the transit over the wire with 
the distance at the first beat after the transit, in this way estimating 
the time of transit to o*i B ; or the observer employs a " chronograph," 



vided with a clamping apparatus, by which the observer, after having 
beforehand set to the approximate declination of a star, can clamp 
the axis so that the telescope cannot be moved except very slowly 
by a handle pushing the end of a fine screw against the clamp arm, 
which at the other side is pressed by a strong spring. By this 
slow motion, the star is made to run along one of the horizontal 
wires (or if there are two close ones, in the middle between them), 
after which the microscopes are read off. A movable horizontal 
wire or declination-micrometer is also often used. The field or 
the wires can be illuminated at the observer's pleasure; the lamps are 
placed at some distance from the piers in order not to heat the 
instrument, and the light passes through holes in the piers and 
through the hollow axis to the cube, whence it is directed to the 
eye-end by a system of prisms. 4 

The time of the star's transit over the middle wire is never 
exactly equal to the actual time of its meridian passage, as the plane 
in which the telescope turns never absolutely coincides with the 
meridian. Let the production of the westend of the axis meet 
the celestial sphere in a point of which the altitude above the horizon 
is b (the error of inclination), and of which the azimuth is 90 — a 
(the azimuth being counted from stmth through west), while the 
optical axis of the telescope makes the angle 90 + c with the west 
end of the axis of the instrument, then the correction to the ob- 
served time of transit will be (asin(<£— 6) + b cos (<t>—8) -f* c) /cos 5, 
where 4> is the latitude of the station and 6 the declination of 
the star. ^ This is called Tobias^ Mayer's formula, and is very con- 
venient if only a few observations have to be reduced. Putting 
b sin 0— a cos <f> = n, we get Hansen's formula, which gives the 
correction = b sec <f> + n (tan 6 — tan 4>) + c sec 5, which is 
more convenient for a greater number of observations. The daily 
aberration is always deducted from c y as it is also multiplied by 
sec 5 (being 0*31' cos 4> sec t 6). The above corrections are for upper 
culmination; below the pole 180 — 6 has to be substituted for 5. 
The constant c is determined by pointing the instrument on one 
of the collimators, measuring the distance of its wire-cross from the 
centre wire of the transit circle by^ a vertical wire movable by a 
micrometer screw, reversing t the instrument and repeating the 
operation, or (without reversing) by pointing the two collimators 
on one another and measuring the distance of first one and then the 
other wire-cross from the centre wire. The inclination b is measured 
directly by a level which can be suspended on the pivots. 5 Having 
thus found b and c, the observation of two stars of known right 
ascension will furnish two equations from which the clock error 
and the azimuth can be found. For finding the azimuth it is most 
advantageous to use two stars differing as nearly 90 in declination 
as possible, such as a star near the pole and one near the equator, 
or better still (if the weather permits it) two successive meridian 
transits of a close circumpolar star (one above and one below the 
pole), as in this case errors in the assumed right ascension will not 
influence the result. 

The interval of time between the culminations or meridian 
transits of two stars is their difference of right ascension, 24 hours 
corresponding to 360 or 1 hour to 15 . If once the absolute right 
ascensions of a number of standard stars are known, it is very simple 
by means of these to determine the R.A. of any number of stars. 
The absolute R.A. of a star is found by observing the interval 
of time between its culmination and that of the sun. _ If the in- 
clination of the ecliptic t («) is known, and the declination of the 
sun (6) is observed at the time of transit, we have sin a tan e ~ tan 5, 
which gives the R.A. of the sun, from which, together with the 
observed interval of time corrected for the rate of the clock, we get 
the R.A. of the star. Differentiation of the formula shows that 
observations near the equinoxes are most advantageous, and that 
errors in the assumed e and the observed 6 will have no influence 
if the Aa is observed at two epochs when the sun's R.A. is A and 
180 — A or as near thereto as possible. A great number of ob- 
servations of this kind will furnish materials for a standard cata- 
logue; but the right ascensions of many important catalogues have 
been found by making use of the R.A.'s of a previous catalogue 
to determine the clock error and thus to improve the individual 
adopted R.A.'s of the former catalogue. 

In order to determine absolute declinations or polar distances, it 
is first necessary to determine the co-latitude (or distance of the pole 
from the zenith) by observing the upper and lower culmination 
of a number of circumpolar stars. The difference between the 
circle reading after observing a star and the reading corresponding 
to the zenith is the zenith distance of the star, and this plus the 
co-latitude is the north polar distance or 90 — 6. In order to 

and by pressing an electric key causes a mark to be made on a 
paper stretched over a uniformly revolving drum, on which the 
clock beats are at the same time also marked electrically. 

4 The idea of illuminating through the axis is due to H. Ussher, 
professor of astronomy in Dublin (d. 1790). 

5 To avoid the use of a very large level, the pivots of the new 
transit circle at Kiel are supplied with small riders" carrying 
a wire-cross; these can in turn be observed through a horizontal 
telescope with a hanging mirror in front of its object-glass, whereby 
the difference in height of the two pivots above a horizontal line 
may be measured.

determine the zenith point of the circle, the telescope i3 directed 
vertically downwards and a basin of mercury is placed under it, 
forming an absolutely horizontal mirror. Looking through the 
telescope the observer sees the horizontal wire and a reflected 
image of the same, and if the telescope is moved so as to make 
these coincide, its optical axis will be perpendicular to the plane of 
the horizon, and thecircle reading will be 180° + zenith point. In 
observations of stars refraction has to be taken into account as well 
as the errors of graduation and flexure, and, if the bisection of the 
star on the horizontal wire was not made in the centre of the field, 
allowance must be made for curvature (or the deviation of the 
star's path from a great circle) and for the inclination of^ the hori- 
zontal wire to the horizon. The amount of this inclination is 
found by taking repeated observations of the zenith distance of 
a star during the one transit, the pole star being the most suitable 
owing to its slow motion. 

Attempts have been made in various places to record the transits 
of a star photographically; with most success at the Georgetown 
College Observatory, Washington (since 1889). A sensitive plate 
is placed in the focus of a transit instrument and a number of short 
exposures made, their length and the time they are made being 
registered automatically by a clock. The exposing shutter is a 
thin strip of steel, fixed to the armature of an electromagnet. The 
plate thus gives a series of dots or short lines, and^ the vertical 
wires are photographed on the plate by throwing light through 
the object-glass for one or two seconds. This seems to give better 
results than the method adopted at the Paris observatory, where 
the plate is moved by clock-work and the exposure is comparatively 
long, while the image of a fixed slit is photographed at different 
recorded instants.

TRANSLATION (Lat. trans, across, and lalus, the participle 
otferre, to carry), literally a carrying over or transference from 
one to another, and so from one medium to another. Among 
the more literal usages is the translation of Enoch in the Bible 
(Heb. xi. 5), or the ecclesiastical removal of a bishop to another 
see. But the commonest sense of the word is in connexion with 
the rendering of one language into another. 

The characteristics of a good translation in the literary sense, 
and the history of the influence, through translations, of one 
literature on another, are worth more detailed notice. Dryden 
nas prescribed the course to be followed in the execution of 
the ideal translation: " A translator that would write with any 
force or spirit of an original must never dwell on the words of 
his author. He ought to possess himself entirely, and perfectly 
comprehend the genius and sense of his author, the nature of the 
subject, and the terms of the art or subject treated of; and then 
he will express himself as justly, and with as much life, as if he 
wrote an original; whereas, he who copies word for word loses 
all the spirit in the tedious transfusion." Comparatively few 
translators have satisfied this canon. A writer capable of attain- 
ing the standard set up by Dryden is naturally more disposed 
to use his powers to express his own views than those of his 
foreign predecessors. No doubt at all times, and in all countries, 
translations have usually been produced for utilitarian purposes, 
and not from artistic motives. In the first instance we may 
assume that translations were undertaken in a spirit of educa- 
tional propaganda as a means of communicating new ideas and 
new facts to a somewhat uninstructed and uncritical public, 
indifferent as to matters of form. But, though the translator's 
primary motive is didactic, he is insensibly led to reproduce the 
manner as well as the matter of his original as closely as possible. 
Montaigne warns aspirants of the difficulty in dealing with 
authors remarkable for the finish of their execution. " II faict 



bon," he writes in the Apologie de Redmond Sebonde, " traduire 
les aucteurs comme celuy-la ou il n'y a gueres que la matiere a 
representer; mais ceux qui ont donne beaucoup a la grace et a 
l'elegance de langage ils sont dangereux a entreprendre nomme- 
ment pour les rapporter a un idiome plus foible." As it happens, 
however ihe task of translating foreign masterpieces has 
frequently been undertaken by writers of undisputed literary 
accomplishment whose renderings have had a permanent effect 
on the literature of their native country. 

It was certainly the case when Rome, having conquered 
Greece, was captured by her captive. There is much point 
and little exaggeration in the statement that " when the Greek 
nation became a province of Rome, the Latin literature became 
a province of the Greek "; and this peaceful victory was initiated 
by a series of translations made by writers of exceptional ability 
and, in some cases, of real genius. The first translator whose 
name is recorded in the history of European literature is L. 
Livius Andronicus, a manumitted Greek slave who about 240 
B.C., rendered the Odyssey into Saturnian verse. This transla- 
tion, of which some fragments are preserved, was long in use as 
a school text, for Horace studied it under the formidable Orbilius;* 
but Andronicus appears to have recognized his mistake in using 
the native Latin measure as a vehicle of literary expression, 
and is said to have rendered Greek tragedies and comedies into 
metres corresponding to those of his Greek originals. The deci- 
sion was momentous, for it influenced the whole metrical develop- 
ment of Latin poetry. The example set by Andronicus was 
followed by Naevius and Ennius, both of whom laid the founda- 
tions of the Latin theatre by translating Greek plays — especially 
those of Euripides — and naturalized in Rome the hexameter, 
which, as practised later by Lucretius and Virgil, was destined 
to become "the stateliest measure ever moulded by the lips of 
man." The tradition of translating more or less freely was 
continued by Pacuvius, the nephew of Ennius, as well as by 
Plautus and Terence, whose comedies are skilful renderings or 
adaptations from the New Attic Comedy of Philemon, Diphilus 
and Menander. A persistent translator from the Greek was 
Cicero, who interpolates in his prose writings versified renderings 
of passages from Homer, Aeschylus, Sophocles and Euripides 
which prove the injustice of the popular verdict on his merits 
as a poet. Cicero not only translated the oration of Demosthenes 
On Ike Crown, but also made Latin versions of Plato's Timaeus 
(part of which survives), of Xenophon's Oeconomicus, and of 
the Phaenomena, an astronomical poem by Aratus of Soli, an 
Alexandrian imitator of Hesiod. This last performance was 
a tribute to the prevailing fashion of the moment, for the Alex- 
andrian poets had supplanted the early Greek school in favour 
among the literary circles of Rome. To the foregoing list may 
be added the great name of Catullus, whose Coma Berenices is 
translated from Callimachus, and Cornelius Gallus is mentioned 
as a translator of Euphorion. Complete translations became 
less and less necessary as a knowledge of Greek spread among 
the educated class. But the practice of translating fragments 
of Greek verse continued throughout the classic period of Latin 
literature, and the translations of Greek originals incorporated 
by Virgil were duly pointed out by Octavius Avitus. 

The knowledge of Greek declined with the empire, and trans- 
lations were accordingly produced for the benefit of students 
who were curious concerning the philosophic doctrines of the 
Athenians and the Neoplatonists. Porphyry's introduction to 
Aristotle's Categories was translated by Victorinus about the 
reign of Julian the Apostate; at the end of the 5th century this 
introduction was once more translated by Boetius, whose trans- 
lations of Aristotle's Categories and other logical treatises began 
the movement which ended in establishing the Greek philosopher 
as the most profound and authoritative exponent of intellectual 
problems during the middle ages, tlato was less fortunate, 
for he was known to students chiefly by the Latin version of the 
Timaeus made by Chalcidius (it is said) for Hosius, the bishop 
of Cordova. Cassiodorus, the contemporary of Boetius, went 
farther afield when he ordered a Latin translation of Josephus 
to be prepared; but the interest in Aristotle extended to the

East, and in the 6th century he was translated into Syriac by 
Sergius of Resaina. The Syrians acted as interpreters of Greek 
learning to the Arabs, and during the 8th and 9th centuries — 
chiefly through the staff of translators organized at Bagdad by 
Honein ibn Ishak — the works of Plato and Aristotle, as well as 
those of Hippocrates and Galen, were translated into Arabic. 
These translations are of capital importance in the history of 
European thought. Many of them were introduced into Spain 
by the Arabs, and were rendered — in some cases through the 
intermediary of a Castilian-speaking Jew — into Latin at the 
college of translators founded in ir30 (or shortly afterwards) 
at Toledo by Raymund, archbishop of that city. Circulating 
widely throughout western Europe, these Latin translations 
supplied the learned with a third- or fourth-hand knowledge of 
Greek philosophy. When Albertus Magnus, St Thomas Aquinas, 
or any other early light of the schools refers to Aristotle, it must 
be borne in mind that he often had no more exact acquaintance 
with the text which he expounds or confutes than could be 
gathered from an indirect Latin version of an Arabic rendering 
of a Syriac translation of a Greek original. This accounts for 
jnany misunderstandings and errors which would otherwise 
be incomprehensible. Among the earliest European translators 
who made their way to Toledo were Adelard of Bath, who 
rendered an Arabic version of Euclid into Latin; the English- 
man known as Robert de Retines, afterwards archdeacon of 
Pamplona, the first translator of the Koran, which he did into 
Latin in 1141-1143 by order of Peter the Venerable; and Gerard 
of Cremona, who, towards the end of the 12th century, was 
responsible for over seventy translations from the Arabic, 
including Ptolemy's Almagest and many of Aristotle's treatises, 
as well as works by Galen, Hippocrates and Avicenna. Early 
in the 13th century Michael Scot, who had begun his Arabic 
studies at Palermo, visited Toledo and (perhaps with the help 
of the Jew Andreas, if we are to believe the statement of Her- 
mann the German, repeated by Roger Bacon) translated into 
Latin various works of Aristotle, Avicenna, and — more especially 
— Averroes. These Latin translations by Michael Scot intro- 
duced Averroes to the notice of Western scholars, and the fact 
that they were used at the universities of Paris and Bologna 
gave the first impetus to the vogue of Averroistic doctrine which 
lasted from the time of St Thomas Aquinas to the rise of Martin 
Luther. At Toledo, between 1240 and 1256, Hermann the 
German translated into Latin the commentaries of Averroes 
on Aristotle's Ethics, together with abridgments of the Poetic 
and the Rhetoric made respectively by Averroes and Alfarabi. 
But, at the very period of Hermann the German's residence at 
Toledo, a more satisfactory method of translation was begun. 
Within half a century of the conquest of Constantinople in 1204 
a visit to Spain was no longer indispensable for a would-be 
translator of Greek philosophical treatises. The original texts 
slowly became more available, and a Latin translation of Aris- 
totle's Ethics seems to have been made from the Greek by order 
of Robert Grosseteste, bishop of Lincoln, between 1 240-1 244. 
Towards the end of the century the indefatigable William of 
Moerbeke (near Ghent) — mentioned as " William the Fleming " 
by Roger Bacon — produced, amongst numerous other Latin 
renderings from the Greek, versions of Aristotle's Rhetoric and 
Politics which have commended themselves to more exact 
scholars of the modern German type. The Latin renderings 
from the Arabic were current till a much later date; but it was 
henceforth accepted, at least in principle, that translations of 
the Greek classics should be made direct from the original text. 
Meanwhile the work of translating foreign productions into 
the local vernacular had been begun in the north and west of 
Europe. Towards the end of the 9th century an illustrious 
English translator appeared in the person of King Alfred, who 
rendered St Gregory the Great's Cura pastoralis into West 
Saxon " sometimes word for word, sometimes sense for sense." 
Alfred is also regarded, though with less certainty, as the 
translator of Bede's Historia ecclesiastica and the Historic 
adversus paganos of Orosius. The version of St Gregory's treatise 
is the most literal of the three; omissions are frequent in the 



renderings of Bede and Orosius, and in all the diction is disfigured 
by latinisms. A larger conception of a translator's function 
is noticeable in Alfred's version of Boetius's De consolatione 
philosophiae, a famous Neoplatonic treatise which was the 
delight of the middle ages, and was translated later into German 
by Notker Labeo, into French ,by Jean de Meung, and twice 
again into English by Chaucer and by Queen Elizabeth respec- 
tively. In translating Boetius, Alfred deals more freely with 
his author, interpolates passages not to be found in the extant 
texts of the original, and yet succeeds in giving an adequate 
interpretation which is also an excellent specimen of English 
prose. If the alliterative verses found in one manuscript of 
Alfred's translation are accepted as his work, it is clear that he 
had no poetic faculty; but he has the credit of opening up a new 
path, of bringing England into contact with European thought, 
and of stimulating such writers as Werferth, bishop of Worcester 
— the translator of St Gregory's Dialogues — to proceed on the 
same Hue. Some forty years earlier John Scotus (Erigena) had 
won celebrity as a translator by his Latin renderings of works 
ascribed to the mysterious 5th century Neoplatonist who passes 
under the name of Dionysius the Areopagite. Towards the close 
of Alfred's reign some countrymen of Erigena bettered his 
example by producing Irish versions of Hippocrates and Galen 
at St Gallen. St Gallen became a centre of translation, and 
there, at the beginning of the nth century, Notker Labeo 
presided over a committee of interpreters who issued German 
renderings of certain treatises by Aristotle, Terence's Andria 
and Virgil's Eclogues. Far greater literary importance attaches 
to Syntipas,the title given by Michael Andreopulos to a collection 
of ancient Oriental tales which he translated from an intermediate 
Syriac version into Greek at the request of the Armenian duke 
of Melitene about the end of the nth century. These stories 
were retranslated into French verse and (by Jean de Haute-Seille) 
into Latin during the course of the 12th century under the respec- 
tive titles of the Sept sages de Rome and Dolopathos; they were 
utilized in the Cento novelle antiche, in the Libro dei sette sayj, 
and in the Decamerone, and were finally absorbed by every 
literature in Europe. Immense popularity was won by the 
Liber gestorum Barlaam et Josaphat, a Latin translation made in 
the nth or 12th century from the Greek, and recast in many 
European languages during the 13th century. The book is in 
fact a legendary life of Buddha adapted to the purposes of 
Christianity by a monk; but it was accepted as an historical 
record, the undiscerning credulity of the faithful informally 
canonized Barlaam and Josaphat, and ultimately compelled the 
Latin Church to include these two fictitious beings as saints in 
the Martyrologium romanum. This is perhaps the most curious 
result attained by any translation. The interest in Eastern 
apologues and moralizing stories, which was early shown in 
Marie de France's translation of Aesopic fables, was further 
demonstrated by the Castilian translations of Kalilah and 
Dimnah and Sindibad made about the middle of the 13th 
century, by (or at the command of) Alphonso the Learned and 
his brother the Infante Fadrique respectively. 

The enthusiasm for these Oriental stories was communicated 
to the rest of Europe by John of Capua's Directorium humanae 
vitae (1270), a Latin translation of Kalilah and Dimnah; but, in 
the meanwhile, as the younger European literatures grew in 
power and variety, the field of translation necessarily widened 
to such an extent that detailed description becomes impossible. 
Geoffrey of Monmouth's Historia regum Britanniae f which pur- 
ports to be a free version of an unnamed Breton book, is the 
source of the Arthurian legends which reappeared transformed 
in elaborate French versions, and were transmitted to the rest 
of Europe during the r2th and 13th centuries. During this 
period of French literary supremacy instances of bilingual 
faculty are not wanting in the form of translations: shortly 
after the middle of the 13th century Brunetto Latini translated 
passages of Cicero into Italian, and selections from Sallust into 
French. A hundred years later there are unmistakable indica- 
tions that the middle ages are departing, that the French 
suzerainty over literature is at an end, and that the advent of

the New Humanism is an accomplished fact. The early Renais- 
sance had already dawned in Italy: a renewed interest in the 
Latin classics (Greek was not yet generally cultivated by scholars) 
proved that there was a revival of learning in France. Livy 
was done into French by Bersuire, Seneca by Bauchant, 
Boccaccio by Laurent de Premier Fait, and a celebrated trans- 
lator appeared in the person of Nicolas Oresme, who, however, 
rendered Aristotle from a Latin version. In England Chaucer 
executed translations of Boetius and part of the Roman de la 
rose, and succeeded equally in interpreting the philosophic 
treatise and the allegorical poem. A still further advance is 
discernible in the book of travels ascribed to Sir John Mande- 
ville: this work, which seems to have been originally written in 
French, is rendered into English with an exceptional felicity 
which has won for the translator the loose-fitting but not 
altogether inappropriate title of " the father of English prose." 
The English version of Mandeville is assigned to the beginning 
of the 15th century. About 1470 Sir Thomas Malory produced 
from French originals his Morte d } Arthur, a pastiche of different 
texts translated with a consummate art which amounts to 
originality. Malory's inspired version, together with the 
numerous renderings from the French issued (and often made 
personally) by Caxton, stimulated the public taste for romantic 
narrative, raised the standard of execution, and invested the 
translator with a new air of dignity and importance. 

Yet the 15th century has a fair claim to be regarded as the 
golden age of translation. The Gothic version of the Bible, 
made by Ulfilas during the 4th century almost simultaneously 
with St Jerome's Vulgate, is invaluable as the sole literary 
monument of a vanished language; the 14th century English 
version by Wycliffe and the 15th century English versions 
which bear the names of Tyndale and Coverdale are interesting 
in themselves, and are also interesting as having contributed 
to the actual Authorized Version of 161 1. But they are incom- 
parably less important than Luther's German translation of the 
Bible (1522-1534) which, apart from its significance as indicating 
the complete victory of the liberal middle class and the irreme- 
diable downfall of the feudal and ecclesiastical autocracy, 
supplanted minor dialects and fixed the norm of literary expres- 
sion in German-speaking countries. Luther, it has been truly 
said, endowed Germany with a uniform literary language, a 
possession which she had lost for nearly three hundred years. 
The effect of profane literature was speedily visible in Fischart's 
translations of Rabelais's Pantagruiline (1572) and the first 
book of Gargantua (1575). But before this date France had 
produced a prince of translators in Jacques Amyot, bishop of 
Auxerre. In 1548 Nicolas de Herberay had published a French 
translation of Amadis de Gaule which enchanted the polite 
world at the court of Henry II., had its day, and is forgotten. 
But Amyot's translation of Plutarch (1559) remains an acknow- 
ledged masterpiece, surviving all changes of taste and all 
variations of the canon of translation. Montaigne writes: 
" Je donne la palme avecque raison, ce me semble, & Jacques 
Amyot, sur tous nos escripvains Francois." If " escripvain " be 
understood to mean " translator," this judgment is beyond appeal. 

Lord Berners will not bear comparison with Amyot in. achieve- 
ment or influence; but. though less completely equipped and 
less uniformly happy in his'choice of texts (for Amyot translated 
the Aetkiopian History and Daphnis and Cliloe as well as Plu- 
tarch), Lord Berners holds a distinguished place in the ranks 
of English translators. His renderings of Fernandez de San 
Pedro's Cdrcel de amor and of Guevara's Libra aureo are now 
read solely by specialists engaged in tracing English euphuism to 
its remoter sources, and some of his other translations — the Boke 
of Duke Huon of Burdeux and Arthur of Little Britain — are too 
poor in substance to be interesting nowadays. But Lord Berners 
is justly remembered by his notable translation of Froissart 
(1 523-1 525). Froissart offers fewer opportunities than Guevara 
for the display of that " fecundious art of rhetoric " in which the 
English translator thought himself deficient, and, with this 
temptation removed, Lord Berners is seen at his best. In his 
version of Froissart, apart from endless confusion of proper 



names, he makes few mistakes of any real importance, and, if he 
scarcely equals his original in brio, he is almost invariably ade- 
quate in reproducing the French blend of simplicity with state- 
liness. Such translations as Phaer's Virgil (1557) and Golding's 
Ovid (1561) have not the historical importance of William 
Painter's Palace of Pleasure, a miscellaneous collection of stories 
rendered from the Italian, nor of Jasper Heywood's version of 
Seneca (1581) whose plays had exercised immense influence upon 
the methods of Gamier and Montchretien in France. Though 
Kyd translated Garnier's Cornilie, the Senecan system was 
destined to defeat in England, and Heywood's translation did 
not even postpone the catastrophe. On the other hand Marlowe 
found the subject of»his Tamburlaine in Painter's collection, and 
thus began the systematic exploitation of the Palace of Pleasure 
which was continued by his successors on the stage. A trans- 
lator of the rarest excellence was forthcoming in Sir Thomas 
North, who rendered Guevara (1557) from the French (revising 
his second edition from the Spanish), and The Morall Philosophic 
of Doni — " a worke first compiled in the Indian tongue " — 
from the Italian (1570). But, good as they are, both these 
versions are overshadowed by the famous translation of Plutarch 
which North published in 1579. He may have referred occa- 
sionally to the Greek, or perhaps to some intermediate Latin 
rendering; but the basis of his work is Amyot, and his English 
is not inferior to the French in sonority and cadence of phrase. 
This retranslation of a translation is a masterpiece of which 
fragments are incorporated with scarcely any change in Corio- 
lanus, Julius Caesar and Antony and Cleopatra; and touches from 
North have been noted also in the Midsummer Night's Dream 
and in Timon of Athens. Amyot greatly influenced the develop- 
ment of French prose, and his translation was the source of 
Racine's Mithridate; but, if we reflect that Shakespeare not only 
took some of his subjects from the English Plutarch and found 
nothing to amend in the diction of many passages, North's 
triumph may be reckoned as even more signal than Amyot's. 
Very little below North's translation of Plutarch comes 
John Florio's translation of Montaigne (1603), a fantastically 
ingenious performance which contributed a celebrated passage 
to The Tempest and introduced the practice of the essay into 
England. * It is impossible to cope with the activity of English 
translators during the last half of the 16th century and the first 
half of the 17th. To this period belongs Chapman's impressive 
and resounding translation (1 598-1616) of Homer, which was to 
enrapture Keats two hundred years later. Adlington's version 
of Apuleius, Underdown's renderings of Heliodorus and Ovid, 
the translations of Livy, Pliny, Suetonius and Xenophon 
issued in quick succession by Philemon Holland are vivid and 
often extravagantly picturesque in their conveyance of classic 
authors into Elizabethan prose. With them must be named the 
translator of Tacitus (1591), Sir Henry Savile, who served later 
on the committee which prepared the Authorized Version of 
the Bible, and must therefore be counted amongst those who 
have exercised a permanent influence on English prose style. 
Thomas Shelton produced the earliest translation (161 2) of 
Don Quixote, a version which, in spite of its inaccuracies and 
freakishness, preserves much of the tone and atmosphere of the 
original. Mabbe's translation (1622) of Guzmdn de Alfarache 
was lauded by Ben Jonson, and widely read during the 17th 
century, and his version of the Celestina deserved a success which 
it failed to obtain. It compares most favourably with a version 
of Tasso (1600) by Edward Fairfax, who has been persistently 
overpraised. But the Puritanical instinct of the English people, 
powerful even when not in the ascendant, was an insuperable 
obstacle to the acclimatization of Spanish literature in England. 
The Leviathan has obscured Hobbes's fame as a translator, but 
he is known to scholars by his sound but crabbed rendering of 
Thucydides (1629), and by a wholly unnecessary version of 
Homer which Ke published at the very end of his career (1674). 
Sir Roger L'Estrange is responsible for translations of Seneca, 
Cicero and Josephus, which are usually lively enough to be 
readable and unfaithful enough to be misleading; the most 
popular of his renderings is a translation of Quevedo's Suefios

TRANSOM— TRANSVAAL 



(made through the French) which owes most of its vogue during 
the Restoration rather to 'its reckless indecency than to its 
intrinsic merit. Dryden's free translations of Juvenal (1693) 
and Virgil (1697) treat the original authors with a cavalier 
freedom, but at least they preserve the meaning, if not the 
conciseness and point, of the Latin. 

Among the multitudinous English translations of the 18th 
century it is only necessary to mention Pope's versions of the 
Iliad (1715-1720) and the Odyssey (1725-1726), and Cowper's 
rendering of Homer, issued in 1791. These neat translations 
necessarily fail to convey any impression of Homer's epical 
grandeur, and they set a mischievous fashion of artificial " ele- 
gance " which has been too often adopted by their successors; 
but both Pope and Cowper conform faithfully to the mistaken 
canon of their age, and both have fugitive moments of felicity. 
A posthumous translation of Don Quixote bearing the name of 
Charles Jarvis appeared in 1742, has been reprinted times 
innumerable ever since, and has helped to make Cervantes's 
masterpiece known to generations of English-speaking people. 
Defective in point of exact scholarship, it has the merit of agree- 
able perspicuity, and there seems no reason to believe the remark, 
ascribed by Warburton to Pope, that Jarvis " translated Don 
Quixote without knowing Spanish": the available evidence is 
strongly against this malicious theory. The most remarkable 
translations of the 18th century, however, appeared in Germany: 
these are the versions of the Odyssey (1781) and Iliad (1793) by 
Voss, and A. W. von Schlegel's rendering of Shakespeare (1797- 
1810), which gave a powerful impulse to the romantic movement 
on the Continent. 

Byron's version of a Spanish ballad and Shelley's renderings 
of Calderon are interesting exhibitions of original genius volun- 
tarily accepting a subordinate r61e. More importance attaches 
to Carlyle's translation of Wilhelm Meister (1824), a faithful 
rendering free from the intolerable mannerisms and tricks which 
the translator developed subsequently in his original writings. 
William Taylor bad long before translated Burger's Lenore, 
Lessing's Nathan and Goethe's Iphigenia; but such interest 
as the English nation has been induced to take in German litera- 
ture dates from the appearance of Carlyle's translation. If he 
did nothing more, he compelled recognition of the fact that 
Germany had at last produced an original genius of the highest 
class. Calder6n found accomplished translators in Denis 
Florence MacCarthy (1848-1873) and in Edward FitzGerald 
(1853), who also attempted to render Sophocles into English; 
but these are on a much lower plane than the translation of 
the Rubaiydt (1859) of Omar Khayyam, in which, by a miracle 
of intrepid dexterity, a half-forgotten Persian poet is transfigured 
into a pessimistic English genius of the 19th century. Versions 
of Dante by Longfellow (whose translations of poems by minor 
authors are often admirable), of Latin or Greek classics by 
Conington, Munro, Jowctt and Jebb, maintain the best traditions 
of the best translators. William Morris was less happy in his 
poetical versions of Virgil (1875) anc * the Odyssey (1887) than in 
his prose translations of The Story of Grettir the Strong (1869) and 
The Volsunga Saga (1870) — both made in collaboration with 
Magnusson — and in his rendering of Beowulf (1895). In his 
Lays of France (1872) Arthur O'Shaughnessy skirts the borders 
of translation without quite entering into the field; he elaborates, 
paraphrases and embroiders rather than translates the lais of 
Marie de France. 

Most versions of modern foreign writers are mere hackwork 
carelessly executed by incompetent hands, and this is even more 
true of England than of France and Germany. But, with the 
development of literature in countries whose languages are 
unfamiliar, the function of the translator increases in importance, 
and in some few cases he has risen to his opportunity. Through 
translations the works of the great Russian novelists have become 
known to the rest of Europe, and through translations of Ibsen 
the dramatic methods of the modern stage have undergone a 
revolution. (J. F.-K.) 

TRANSOM (probably a corruption of Lat. transtrum> a thwart, 
in a' boat; equivalents are Fr. traverse, croisillon, Ger. Losholz), 



the architectural term given to the horizontal lintel or beam 
which is framed across a window, dividing it into stages or 
heights. In early Gothic ecclesiastical work transoms are only 
found in belfry unglazed windows or spire lights, where they 
were deemed necessary to strengthen the mullions in the 
absence of the iron stay bars, which in glazed windows served a 
similar purpose. In domestic work, on account of the opening 
casements, they are more frequently found. In the later Gothic, 
and more especially the Perpendicular period, the introduction 
of transoms became very general in windows of all kinds. 

TRANSUBSTANTTATTON, the term adopted by the Roman 
Catholic Church to express her teaching on the subject of the 
conversion of the Bread and Wine into the Body and Blood of 
Christ in the Eucharist. Its signification was authoritatively 
defined by the Council of Trent in the following words: " If any 
one shall say that, in the Holy Sacrament of the Eucharist there 
remains, together with the Body and Blood of Our Lord Jesus 
Christ, the substance of the Bread and Wine, and shall deny 
that wonderful and singular conversion of the whole substance 
of the Bread into (His) Body and of the Wine into (His) Blood, 
the species only of the Bread and Wine remaining — which con- 
version the Catholic Church most fittingly calls Transubstantia- 
tion — let him be anathema." l The word Transubstantiation is 
not found earlier than the 12th century. But in the Eucharistic 
controversies of the 9th, 10th and nth centuries the views 
which the term embodies were clearly expressed; as, for example, 
by Radbertus Paschasius (d. 865), who wrote that " the substance 
of the Bread and Wine is efficaciously changed interiorly into 
the Flesh and Blood of Christ," and that after the consecration 
what is there is " nothing else but Christ the Bread of Heaven." 2 
The words " substantially converted " appear in the formula 
which Berengarius was compelled to sign in 1079. Assuming 
that the Expositio canonis tnissae ascribed to St Pietro Damiani 
(d. 1072) is doubtful, we may take it that the first use of the word 
is in a passage of Hildebert de Savardin 3 (d. 1133), who brings 
it into an exhortation quite informally, as if it were in common 
use. 4 It is met with in a Decretal of Innocent III. 6 The fourth 
Council of Lateran fully adopted it (12 15). It is clear from the 
treatise of Radbertus Paschasius already quoted that the word 
" substance " was used for reality as distinguished from outward 
appearance, and that the word " species " meant outward appear- 
ance as opposed to reality. The terms, therefore, were not 
invented by St Thomas Aquinas, and are not mere scholastic 
subtlety. The definition of the Council of Trent was intended 
both to enforce the accepted Catholic position and to exclude 
the teaching of Luther, who, whilst not professing to be certain 
whether the " substance " of the Bread and Wine could or could 
not be said to remain, exclaimed against the intolerance of the 
Roman Catholic Church in defining the question. 6 

For a full and recent exposition of the Catholic teaching on 
Transubstantiation the reader may consult De ecclesiae sacra- 
mentis, auetore Ludovieo Billot, S.J. (Rome, Propaganda Press, 
1896). The £bb6 Pierre Batifol, m his Etudes d'histoire et de 
thiologie positive, 2 me serie {Elaboration de^ la notion de conversion, 
and Conversion et transubstantiation) treats it from the point of view 
of development (V. Lecoffre, Paris, 1905). (4? J. C. H.) 

TRANSVAAL, an inland province of the Union of South Africa 
between the Vaal and Limpopo rivers. It lies, roughly, between 
22^° and 275 S. and 25 and 32 E., and is bounded S. by the 
Orange Free State and Natal, W. by the Cape province and the 
Bechuanaland Protectorate, N. by Rhodesia, E. by Portuguese 
East Africa and Swaziland. Save on the south-west the frontiers, 
for the main part, are well defined natural features. From the 
south-west to the north-cast corners of the colony is 570 m.; east

to west its greatest extent is 397 m. The total area is 111,196 
sq. m., a little less than the area of Great Britain and Ireland. 
The boundaries of the Transvaal have varied from time to time. 
The most important alteration was made in January 1903 when 
the districts of Utrecht and Vryheid, which then formed the 
south-eastern part of the country were annexed to Natal. The 
area thus lost to the Transvaal was 6970 sq. m. (For map see 
South Africa.) 

Physical Features. — About five-sixths of the country lies west 
of the Drakensberg (q.v.), the mountain range which forms the inner 
rim of the great tableland of South Africa. For a few miles on the 
Natal-Transvaal frontier the Drakensberg run east and west and 
here is the pass of Laing'sNek. Thence the mountains sweep 
round to the north, with their precipitous outer slopes facing east. 
For some 250 m. within the province the mountains form a more 
or less continuous range, the highest point being the Mauchberg 
(8725 ft.) in 24 20' 10* S. 30 35 E., while there are several heights 
of 7000 or more feet. Eastward from the foot of the Drakensberg 
stretches a broad belt of low land beyond which rise the Lebombo 
hills running north and south along the parallel of 32 E. and 
approaching within 35 m. of the sea at Delagoa Bay. The Lebombo 
hills are flat topped but with a' well-defined break on' their seaward 
side. This eastern edge forms the frontier between Transvaal and 
Portuguese territory. 

The country west of the Drakensberg, though part of the main 
South African tableland, is not uniform in character, consisting of 
(1) elevated downs, (2) their slopes, (3) the flat " bottom " land. 
The downs or plateaus occupy all the southern part of the country, 
sloping gradually westward from the Drakensberg. That part of 
the plateau east of Johannesburg is from 5000 to 6400 ft. high; 
the western and somewhat ..larger half is generally below 5000 ft. 
and sinks to about 4000 ft. on the Bechuanaland border. This 
plateau land is called the high veld, 1 and covers about 34,000 sq. m. 
The northern edge of the plateau follows an irregular line from 
somewhat north of Mafeking on the west to the Mauchberg on the 
east. This edge is marked by ranges of hills such as the Witwaters- 
rand, Witwatersberg and Magaliesberg; the Witwatersrand, which 
extends eastward to Johannesburg, forming the watershed between 
the rivers flowing to the Atlantic and Indian Ocean. Farther north, 
beyond the intervening slopes and low bush, are two elevated 
regions covering together over 4000 sq. m. They are the Water- 
berg, and, more to the east, separated from the Waterberg by the 
valley of the Magalakwane tributary of the Limpopo, the Zoutpans- 
berg. The Zoutpansberg has steep slopes and is regarded as the 
northern termination of the Drakensberg. An eastern offshoot 
of the Zoutpansberg is known as the Murchison Range. The low 
land between the high veld and the Waterberg and Zoutpansberg 
is^ traversed by the Olifants River, an east flowing tributary of the 
Limpopo. 

The true high veld, extending east to west 120 m. and north to 
south 100 m., consists of rolling grass covered downs, absolutely 
treeless, save where, as at Johannesburg, plantations have been 
made by man, the crest of the rolls being known as builts and the 
hollows^ as laagtes or vleys. The surface is occasionally broken 
by kopjes — either table-shaped or pointed — rising sometimes 100 
ft. above the general level. Small springs of fresh water are fre- 
quent and there are several shallow lakes or pans — flat bottomed 
depressions with no outlet. The largest of these pans, Lake 
Chrissie, some 5 m. long by 1 m. broad, is in the south-eastern 
part of the high veld. The water in the pans is usually brackish. 
The middle veld is marked by long low stony ridges, known as rands, 
and these rands and the kopjes are often covered with scrub, 
while mimosa trees are found in the river valleys. 

The banken veld, formed by the denudation of the plateau, is 
much broken up and is rich in romantic scenery. It covers about 
27,000 sq. m., and has an average breadth of 40 m. In places, 
as between Mafeking and Johannesburg, the descent is in terrace- 
like steps, each step marked by a line of hills; in other places there 
is a. gradual slope and elsewhere the descent is abrupt, with out- 
lying hills and deep^ well-wooded valleys. The rocks at the base of 
the slopes are granite, the upper escarpments are of sedimentary 
rocks. Thence issue many streams which in their way to the 
ocean have forced their way through the ranges of hills which mark 
the steps in the plateau, forming the narrow passes or poorts char- 
acteristic of South African scenery. 

As in the middle veld, rands and kopjes occur in the low or bush 
veld, but the general characteristic of this part of the country, 
which covers over 50,000 sq. m., is its uniformity. The low veld 
east of the Drakensberg begins at about 3000 ft. above the sea 
and slopes to 1000 ft. or less until it meets the ridge of the Lebombo 
hills. The lowest point is at Komati Poort, a gorge through the 
Lebombo hills only 476 ft. above the sea. West and north of the 
Drakensberg the general level of the low veld is not much below 
that of the lowest altitudes of the middle veld, though the climatic 

m j By the Boers the western and less elevated part of the plateau 
is known as the middle veld. 



conditions greatly differ. North of the Zoutpansberg the ground 
talis rapidly, however, to the Limpopo flats which are little over 
1200 ft. above the sea. Near the north-west foot of the Zoutpans- 
berg is the large saltpan from which the mountains get their name. 
Ihe low veld is everywhere covered with scrub, and water is scarce 
the rivers being often dry in the winter season. 

Rtver Systems.— There are four separate river basins in the Trans- 
vaah Ut these the Komati (q.v.) and its affluents, and the Pongola 
and its affluents rise in the high veld and flowing eastward to the 
Indian Ocean drain but a comparatively small area of the province, 
ot which the Pongola forms for some distance the south-eastern 
lrontier. Ihe rest of the country is divided between the drainage 
areasof the Vaal and Limpopo. The Vaal (q.v.) rises in the nigh 
veld in the Ermelo district not far from the source of the Komati 
and that of the Usuto tributary of the Pongola. The Vaal drains 
the greater part of the plateau, flowing Westward towards the 
Atlantic. Ihe waters of the northern escarpments of the plateau 
and of all the region farther north are parried to the Indian Ocean 
by the Limpopo (q.v.) and its tributaries the Olifants, Great Marico, 
Great Letaba, &c. Both the Vaal and the Limpopo in their main 
course have high steep banks. They carry an immense volume of 
water during the summer rains, but are very small streams in the 
winter, when several of their tributaries are completely dry. 2 None 
of the rivers is- navigable within the limits of the province. The 
absence of alluvial deposits of any size is another characteristic 
of the Transvaal rivers. For a considerable distance the Vaal 
forms the frontier between the province and the Orange Free State 
and m similar manner the Limpopo separates the Transvaal from 
Bechuanaland and Rhodesia. Since the first advent of white 
colonists many springs and pans and small streams have dried up, 
this desiccation being attributed, not so much to decreased rainfall, 
as to the burning off of the grass every winter, so that the water, 
instead of soaking in, runs off the hard, baked ground into the larger 
nvers - ^ (F. R. C.) 

Geology. 

A broad ring of crystalline rocks (Swaziland schists) encircles 
the Transvaal except on the south, where the Karroo formation 
extends over the Vaal River. Within this nearly complete circle 
of t crystalline rocks several geological formations have been deter- 
mined, of which the age cannot be more definitely fixed than that 
they are vastly older than the Karroo formation and newer than the 
Swaziland schists. 

The following subdivisions have been recognized by Molengraaff : 
Karroo System, Transvaal System, Vaal River System, South 
African Primary System. Each of these systems is separated 
from the other by a strong unconformity. 

South African Primary System.— -The South African Primary 
System includes a complex of rocks as yet little understood. Ac- 
cording to Molengraaff it includes the two following series: — 

{An upper group including the auri- 
ferous conglomerates of the Rand: 
a lower group (Hospital Hill series) 
of quartzites, shales and conglom- 
erates.

Barberton Series. — Molengraaff considers the Barberton series to 
be the metamorphosed equivalent of the Hospital Hill series, 
while Hatch regards it to be older and to form a portion of his 
Archaean series (Swaziland schists) to which position it is here 
assigned. The chief outcrops are in the south-western Transvaal, 
around Zoutpansberg and in Swaziland. They show a great 
variety of type made up of slates, quartzites, occasional conglom- 
erates, schists with large masses of intrusive granites and gneiss. 

Witwatersrand Series. — It is now generally acknowledged that 
this important series consists of two main groups. Their chief 
occurrences are in the districts of Witwatersrand, Heidelberg, 
Klerksdorp and Venterskroon. The lower group (Hospital Hill 
slates) consists of quartzites and shales, resting on the eroded 
surface of the older granites and schists, and estimated to be from 
10,000 to 12,000 ft. thick. There are occasional bands of conglom- 
erates, sometimes auriferous. In the absence of fossils their age 
cannot be determined. The upper group consists of conglomerates, 
grits and quartzites with a few bands of shales. It has obtained 
notoriety from the conglomerates along certain bands contain- 
ing gold, when they constitute the famous " banket.'* The thick- 
ness varies from 2300 to over 11,000 ft. The conglomerate beds 
occur in belts forming in descending order the Elsburg series, 
Kimberley series, Bird Reef series, Livingstone Reef series, Main 
Reef series. The richest in gold are to be found among the Main 
Reef series, which yields by far the greater part of the total output 
of gold from the Transvaal. The individual beds, seldom more 
than a few feetin thickness and sometimes only a few inches, are 
interstratified with an immense thickness of quartzites. The conglom- 
erates consist almost entirely of pebbles of quartz set in a hard 



2 At the Standerton gauge on the Vaal in 1905-1906, a year of 
extreme drought, the total flow was 8,017,000,000 cub. ft., of which 
7,102,000,000 was storm water. /

matrix consolidated by the deposition of secondary silica. The 
conglomerate bands and quartzites contain large quantities of iron 
pyrites deposited subsequent to their formation, that in the conglom- 
erates containing the gold. Seriate in the form of scales and 
films characterizes those portions which have been faulted, squeezed 
or sheared. Sheets of diabase, apparently volcanic flows, and 
numerous "dykes interfere with the regularity of the stratification. 
The theory of the subsequent infiltration of the gold is that generally 
accepted. No fossils have been discovered, and except that they 
represent some portion or portions of rocks of the Pre-Cape formation 
the age of the upper Witwatersrand beds, as well as that of the 
lower division, remains an open question. They may safely be 
considered to be among the oldest auriferous sediments of the world. 

Vaal River System. — This consists largely of rocks of igneous 
origin, of which the amygdaloidal diabase of Klipriversberg forms 
the type. The other rocks include igneous breccias, shales, coarse 
conglomerates and grits. Near Reitzburg the coarse conglom- 
erates reach a thickness of 400 ft. and about 500 ft. at Kroom- 
draai. This system rests unconformably on the Witwatersrand 
series and is unconformably overlain by the Transvaal system. 
It must, however, be acknowledged that these relationships are very 
imperfectly understood. Compared with other formations they 
occupy restricted areas, being only met with south of Johannesburg, 
around Wolmaransstad, Lichtenburg and east of Manco. 

Transvaal System. — This is a very definite sequence of rocks 
covering immense areas in the centre of the country. The follow- 
ing groups are recognized : Waterberg Series, Pretoria Series, 
Dolomite Series, Black Reef Series. 

The Black Reef Series is composed of quartzites, sandstone, 
slates and conglomerate. It varies in thickness from 100 ft. in 
the southern Transvaal to 1000 ft. at Lydenburg. Thin bands 
of conglomerate, sometimes auriferous, occur near the base. 

The Dolomite Series, known to the Dutch as " Olifants Klip," 
consists of a bluish-grey magnesian limestone with bands of chert. 
The thickness varies from 2600 ft. in the Witwatersrand area to 
5000 ft. around Pretoria; and is about 2600 ft. about Lydenburg. 
It is worn by solution into caves and swallow-holes (Wonder gar ten). 
Gold, lead, copper and iron ores occur as veins. So far it has proved 
to be unfossiliferous. Dykes and intrusive rocks are common. 

The Pretoria Series, formerly known as the Gatsrand series, 
consists of repeated alternations of flagstones and quartzites, 
shales and sheets of diabase. These follow conformably on the 
Dolomite series. In the Marico district the shales become highly 
ferruginous and resemble the Hospital Hill slates of the Witwaters- 
rand series. Near Pretoria duplications of the beds, due to over- 
thrusting, are not uncommon. 

The Waterberg Series lies unconformably on the Pretoria series. 
The colour is usually red, forcibly recalling thepld Red Sandstone 
and Trias of England. Sandstones, quartzites, conglomerates 
and breccia make up the formation.^ They occur to the north- 
east of Pretoria and occupy still wide areas in the Waterberg 
district. 

A complex of igneous rocks of different ages covers immense 
areas in the central Transvaal. Various types pi granite are the 
predominant variety. Syenites, gabbros, norites and volcanic 
rocks are also represented. The granite contains two varieties. 
One is a red granite intruded subsequently to the Waterberg sand- 
stones; another is a grey variety considered to be older than the 
Black Reef series and possibly older than the Witwatersrand 
series. 

The Karroo System attains its^ chief development in the south- 
eastern Transvaal in the districts of Ermelo, Standerton and 
Wakkerstroom. 

The latest classification of Molengraaff subdivides the beds as 
follows : — 

Hoogeveld Series — Beaufort beds of Cape Colony. 

Contains coal-seams. 

Ecca shales. Not present at Vereeniging. 

Dwyka conglomerate. Sandstones and conglomerates with 

coal-seams at Vereeniging. 

The Dwyka conglomerate resembles the same bed in the Cape 
■ province. The boulders consist of very various rocks often of 
large size. Many of them show glacial striae. The direction of 
striae on the underlying quartzitic rocks, particularly well seen near 
the Douglas colliery, Balmoral, point to an ice movement from the 
north-north-west to south-south-east. 

The Ecca series, as in the Cape, consists of sandstones and shales. 
Seams of coal lie near the base, some of them exceeding 20 ft. in 
thickness, but in this case layers of shaly coal are included. The 
overlying sandstones afford good building stones, and frequently, 
as at Vereeniging, yield many fossil plants. These include among 
others, Glossopteris browniana, Gangamopteris cyclopteroides, Sign- 
laria Brardi, Bothrodendron Leslii, Noeggerathiopsis Hislopi. 

The Karroo beds lie almost horizontally, in marked contrast to 
the highly inclined older rocks ; Their distribution, other than in 
the south-eastern districts, is imperfectly understood. Remnants 
have been found of their former existence in the neighbourhood of 
Pretoria; and portions of the Bush veld Sandstone have recently 
been relegated to the Karroo formation. 



The diamond pipes probably represent some of the most recent 
rocks of the Transvaal. They may be of Cretaceous age or even 
later, and in any case belong to the same class as those of Kimberley. 
The recent deposits of the Transvaal may be considered to be 
insignificant. They include the gravels and alluviums of the 
present streams and the almost ubiquitous red sand of aeolian 
origin. 1 (W. G.*) 

Climate. — Although lying on the border of and partly^ within the 
tropics, the Transvaal, owing to its high general elevation, and to 
the absence of extensive marshy tracts, enjoys on the whole a healthy 
invigorating climate, well suited to the European constitution. 
The climate of the high veld is indeed one of the finest in the world. 
The air is unusually dry, owing to the proximity of the Kalahari 
Desert on the west and to the interception on the east by the 
Drakensberg of the moisture bearing clouds from the Indian Ocean, 
The range of temperature is often considerable — in winter it varies 
from about ioo° F. in the shade at 1 p.m. to freezing point at 
night. During summer (Oct.-April) the mean temperature is about 

J 3 ; during winter about 53 °. Nov.-Jan. are the hottest and June— 
uly the coldest months. The chief characteristic of the rainfall 
is its frequent intensity and short duration. During May to August 
there is practically no rain, and in early summer (Sept.-Dec.) the 
rainfall is often very light. The heaviest rain is experienced 
between January and April and is usually accompanied by severe 
thunderstorms. On the eastern escarpment of the Drakensberg 
the rainfall is heavy, 50 or 60 in. in the year, but it diminishes 
rapidly towards the centre of _ the plateau where it averages, at 
Johannesburg about 30 in., 2 while in the extreme west as the Kala- 
hari is approached it sinks to about 12 in. The winds in winter 
are uniformly dry while dust storms are frequent at all seasons — 
a fact which renders the country unsuitable for persons suffering 
from chest complaints. In the eastern part of the plateau snow 
occasionally falls, and frost at night is common during winter. 

The banken veld district is also generally^ healthy though hotter 
than the plateaus, and malarial fever prevails in the lower valleys. 
Malarial fever is also prevalent throughout the low veld, but above 
3000 ft. is usually of a mild type. Nearly all the country below 
that elevation is unsuitable for colonization by whites, while the 
Limpopo flats and other low tracts, including the district between 
the Drakensberg and the Lebombo hills are extremely unhealthy, 
blackwater fever being endemic. In the low veld the shade tempera- 
ture in summer rises to 113 F., but the nights are generally cool, 
and down to 2000 ft. frost occurs in winter. The rainfall in the low 
country is more erratic than on the plateau, and in some districts 
a whole year will pass without rain. 

Flora. — The general characteristic of the flora is the prevalence 
of herbaceous over forest growths; the high veld is covered by^ short 
sweet grasses of excellent quality for pasturage; grass is mingled 
with protea scrub in the middle veld ; the banken veld has a richer 
flora, the valley levels are < well wooded, scattered timber trees 
clothe their sides and the hills are covered with aloe, euphorbia, 
protea and other scrub growths. Among the timber trees of this 
region is the bolkenhout of terblanz (Faurea Saligna) which yields 
a fine wood resembling mahogany. The scrub which covers the 
low veld consists mainly of gnarled stunted thorns with flattened 
umbrella shaped crowns, most of the species belonging to the sub- 
order mimoseae. A rare species is the acacia erioloba Rameel 
doom, akin to the acacia giraffae of Bechuanaland. The wild 
seringa (Burkea africana) is also characteristic of the low veld and 
extends up the slopes of the plateau. The meroola (sclerocarya 
caffra) a medium sized deciduous tree with a rounded spreading 
top is found in the low veld and up the slopes to a height of 4500 ft. 
It is common in the lower slopes of the rands of the low veld. Cotton 
and cotton-like plants and vines are also native to the low veld. 
Few of the low veld bushes are large or straight enough to furnish 
any useful wood, and timber trees are wholly absent from the level 
country. The forest patches are confined to the deep kloofs »of 
the mountains, to the valleys of the larger rivers and to the sea- 
slopes of the Drakensberg and other ranges, where they flourish in 
regions exposed to the sea mists. These patches, called " wood- 
bushes," contain many hardwood trees of great size, their flora 
and fauna being altogether different from that immediately out- 
side the wood. Common species in the woodbush are three varieties 
of yellow wood (Podocarpus), often growing to an enormous size, 
the Cape beech (myrsine), several varieties of the wild pear (Olinia) 
and of stinkwood (Oreodaphne) ironwood and ebony. The largest 
forest areas are in the Pongola district and the Haenertsburg and

Woodbush districts north of the Olifants river. Mimosa and the 
wild wilge-boom (Salix capensis) are the common trees on the banks 
and rivers, while the weeping willow is frequent round the farmsteads, 

Many trees have been introduced and considerable plantations 
made, as for instance on the slopes between Johannesburg and Pre- 
toria. Among the most successful of the imported trees are citrus 
trees, the Australian wattle and the eucalyptus. Tobacco and the 
vine both flourish and most European fruits and vegetables thrive. 
Of native fruits the misple (Vangueria infausta), miscalled the 
wild medlar, is of excellent flavour. It is common on the rands and 
kopjes of the bush veld. Rose and other flowering shrubs and trees 
grow well on the banken veld and in the valleys. A large yellow 
tulip (Homerica pallida) is one of the most abundant flowers on 
moist vlei lands on the high veld and is occasionally met with in 
the low veld; slangkop (Urginea Burkei) with red bulbs like a 
beetroot is a low bush plant apparently restricted to the Transvaal 
and adjacent Portuguese territory. Both these and many other 
plants such as gift-blaar and drouk-gras are poisonous to cattle. 
These poisonous plants are found chiefly in the banken and low 
veld. 

Fauna. — When first entered by white men the Transvaal abounded 
in big game, the lion, leopard, elephant, giraffe, zebra and rhinoceros 
being very numerous, while the hippopotamus and crocodile were 
found in all the rivers. The indiscriminate destruction of these 
animals has greatly reduced their numbers and except in the Pon- 
gola district, at one or two other places on the Portuguese frontier, 
and along the Limpopo the hippopotamus, rhinoceros and crocodile 
are now extinct in the province. A few elephants, giraffes and 
zebras (equus burchelli — the truezebra is extinct) are still found in 
the north and north-eastern districts and in the same regions 
lions and leopards survive in fair numbers. Other animals fairly 
numerous are the shotted hyena, long-eared fox, jackal, aard wolf, 
red lynx, wild cat, wild dog and wart hog. Many species of antelope 
are found, mostly in small numbers, including the kudu, hartebecst, 
the sable and roan antelope, the white tailed and the brindled gnu, 
waterbuck, red buck, duiker, blesbok, palla, springbuck (numerous), 
steinbok, grysbok and klipspringcr. The Africander breed of 
cattle is a well-marked variety, and a characteristic native domestic 
animal. Whether originally imported from Europe by the Portu- 
guese or brought from the nortn by Africans is not certain. It is 
not found in a wild state and the auffalo (bos caffer) is almost if not 
quite extinct in the Transvaal. Among edentata the ant-bear, 
scaly ant-eater and porcupine are plentiful. The spring hare 
(pedetes capensis) abounds. Baboons and other apes are fairly 
common and there are several species of snakes. The ostrich is 
found in the Maricoand Limpopo districts, and more rarely else- 
where; the great kori bustard and the koorhaan are common. 

Insects abound, the greatest pest^ being the tsetse fly, common in 
the low veld. Six species of tick, including the blue tick common 
throughout South Africa, are found, especially in the low veld, where 
they are the means of the transmission of disease to cattle. Mos- 
quitoes, locusts and ants are also common. 

The baba or cat fish and the yellow fish are plentiful in the rivers 
and the trout has been acclimatized. 

To preserve the native fauna the low country on the Portuguese 
frontier has been made a game reserve. It is nearly 300 m. long 
with an average breadth of 50 m. Other reserves have been con- 
stituted in the north of the province. 

Inhabitants. — The population of the Transvaal, on the 17th 
of April 1904, when the first complete census of the country was 
taken, was 1,269,951 (including 8215 British soldiers in garrison), 1 
or 11*342 persons per sq. m. Of these 20-67%, namely 297,277, 
were European or white. Of the coloured population 937,127 
were aboriginals; and 35,547 were of mixed or other coloured 
races. Of thewhites 178,244 (59*95%) were males. The white 
population is broadly divisible into the British and Dutch ele- 
ments, the percentage of other whites in 1904 being but 8-6. 
The Dutch, as their usual designation, Boers, implies, are 
mainly farmers and stock-raisers and are still predominant 
elsewhere than in the Witwatersrand and Pretoria districts. 
They speak the patois of Dutch known as the Taal. The British 
element is chiefly gathered in Johannesburg and other towns on 
the Rand and in Pretoria. The total white population in the 
Witwatersrand and in Pretoria in 1904 was 135,135, and the 
strength of the British in these districts is shown by the fact 
that only 20% was Transvaal born. Of those born outside 
the Transvaal 24*6% came from other British possessions in 
Africa and 24-92% from Great Britain or British colonies other 
than African. Of the non-British or Boer whites Russians 
form 3 '°i%, Germans 1-62% and Dutch (of Holland) 1-14%. 

The natives are found chiefly in Zoutpansberg district, 

1 For most purposes this military element W omitted in the census 
returns. 



wher,e there were 314,797 at the 1904 census, and the adjoining 
districts of Lydenburg and Waterberg, i.e. in the northern and 
north-eastern region of the country. The natives belong to the 
Bantu negro race and are represented chiefly by Basuto, Bech- 
uana, Bavenda, and Xosa-Zulu tribes. None of these peoples 
has any claim to be indigenous, and, save the Bavenda, all are 
immigrants since c. 1817-1820, when the greater part of the 
then inhabitants were exterminated by the Zulu chief Mosi- 
likatze (see § History). After that event Basuto entered the 
country from the south, Bechuana from the west and Swazi, 
Zulu, Shangaan and other tribes from the east and south-east. 

The Basuto, who number 410,020 and form 40% of the total 
population, are now found mostly in the central, northern and north- 
eastern districts, forming in Lydenburg about 67%, and in Zout- 
pansberg about 50% of the inhabitants. The Bechuana, who 
number 64,751, are almost confined to the western and south-western 
districts. 

Next, numerically, to the Basuto and Bechuana peoples are the 
tribes known collectively as Transvaal Kaffirs, of whom there were 
159.860 enumerated at the 1904 census. Altogether the Transvaal 
Kaffirs form 50 % of the inhabitants of Waterberg district, 30 % of 
Zoutpansberg district and 18 %of Middelburg district. Zulus number 
75,601 and form 54% of the population in Wakkerstroom district and 
18% in Standerton district. Elsewhere they are very thinly repre- 
sented. Swazis form more than half the total population of the 
Barberton and Ermelo districts and are also numerous in Wakker- 
stroom. In Barberton, Lydenburg and Zoutpansberg districts 
Shangaan and other east coast tribes are settled, 80,834 being returned 
as born in the Transvaal. The Shangaan are members of a Bantu 
tribe from the Delagoa Bay region who took refuge in the Transvaal 
between i860 and 1862 to escape Zulu raids. They were for some 
time ruled by a Portuguese, Joao Albasini, who had adopted native 
customs. Since 1 873 Swiss Protestant missionaries have lived 
among them and many of the Shangaans are Christians and civilized. 
Several other east coast tribes, such as the Bankuna, are of mixed 
Zulu and Shangaan blood. Among the mixed and other coloured 
races in the census returns figure 1592 Bushmen, 3597 Hottentots 
and 1 147 Koranna; these people are found chiefly in the south- 
western regions and are remnants of the true aboriginal population. 

Besides the tribes whose home is in the Transvaal considerable 
numbers of natives, chiefly members of east coast tribes, Cape 
Kaffirs and Zulus, go to the Witwatersrand to work in the gold 
and other mines. In all there were, in 1904, 135,042 Bantus in the 
country born elsewhere. Many east coast natives after working 
in the mines settle in the northern Transvaal. Of the aboriginal 
South Africans in the Transvaal, at the 190^ census, 77-69% were 
born in the Transvaal. Among the aborigines the number of 
females to males was 114 to 100. (See further Kaffirs; Bechu- 
anas; Zululand; Bushmen; Hottentots; and for languages, 
Bantu Languages). 

The number of Asiatics in the Transvaal in April 1904 was 12,320, 
including 904 Malays, natives of South Africa, and 9986 British 
Indians. They were nearly all domiciled in the Witwatersrand and 
in the towns of Pretoria and Barberton, where they are engaged 
mainly in trade. 

Administrative Divisions and Chief Towns. — The province 
is divided into sixteen magisterial districts. Zoutpansberg, 
25,654 sq. m.; Waterberg, 15,503 sq. m.;Lydenburg, 9868 sq. m., 
occupy the north and north-eastern parts of the country and 
include most of the low veld areas. Barberton district, 5106 
sq. m., is east central. Piet Retief district (in the south-east), 
1673 sq. m., lies between Swaziland and Natal. Along the 
southern border, going east to west from Piet Retief, are the 
districts of Wakkerstroom, 2 1 28 sq. m. ; Standerton, 1959 
sq. m.; Heidelberg, 2410 sq. m.; Potchefstroom, 4805 sq. m.; 
Wolmaransstad, 2169 sq. m., and, occupying the south-western 
corner of the province, Bloemhof, 3003 sq. m. In the west are 
the districts of Lichtenburg, 4487 sq. m.; Marico, 3626 sq. m. 
and Rustenberg, 9511 sq. m. The central regions are divided into 
the districts of Witwatersrand, 1653 sq. m.; Pretoria, 6525 sq. m.; 
Middelburg, 4977 sq. m.; Carolina, 1877 sq. m.; Ermelo, 2995 
sq. m. and Bethel, 1959 sq. m. It will be seen that twenty 
districts are enumerated, these being the divisions under the 
Boer government and still commonly used. In 1904 Bloemhof 
was officially included in Wolmaransstad; Bethel in Standerton; 
Piet Retief in Wakkerstroom, and Carolina in Ermelo. Each 
district is sub-divided into field-cornetcies, the cornetcies 
being themselves divided, where necessary, into urban and 
rural areas. For parliamentary purposes the districts are 
divided infcp single member constituencies. The capital of the

province, and of the Union is Pretoria, with a population (1904) 
of 36,839 (of whom 21,114 were whites). Johannesburg, the 
centre of the gold-mining industry, had a population, within 
the municipal boundary, of 155,642 (83,363 whites). Other 
towns within the Witwatersrand district are Germiston (29,477), 
Boksburg (14,757) and Roodepoort-Maraisburg (19,949), 
virtually suburbs of Johannesburg, and Krugersdorp (20,073) 
and Springs (5270), respectively at the western and east ends 
of the district. Besides Pretoria and the towns in the Wit- 
watersrand district, there are few urban centres of any size. 
Potchefstroom, in the south near the Vaal (pop. 9348), is the 
oldest town in the Transvaal. Klerksdorp (4276) is also near the 
Vaal, S.S.W. of Potchefstroom. Middelburg (5085^ is the largest 
town on the railway between Pretoria and Delagoa Bay; 
Barberton (2433), the centre of the De Kaap gold-fields, lies on 
the slopes of the Drakensberg overlooking the De Kaap valley. 
Communications, — Before 1888 the only means of communication 
was by road. In that year the government sanctioned the building 
of a " steam tramway " — a railway in all but name — from the 
Boksburg collieries to the Rand gold mines. In 1890 the construc- 
tion of the Transvaal section of the railway to connect Pretoria 
with Delagoa Bay was begun, the line from Lourenco Marques 
having been completed to Komati Poort in December 1887. The 
line to Pretoria was not opened until July 1895. Meantime, in 
September 1892, the Cape railway system had been extended to 
Johannesburg and in December 1895 the through line between 
Durban and Pretoria was completed. Since that date many other 
lines have been built. The majority of the railways are the property 
of and are worked by the state. With the exception of a few purely 
local lines they arc of the standard South African gauge — 3 ft. 6 in. 
The lines all converge on Johannesburg. The following table gives 
the distances from that city to other places in South Africa 1 : —

Besides the lines enumerated the other railways of importance are: 
(1) A line from Johannesburg eastward via Springs and Breyten 
to Machadodorp onthe Pretoria-Delagoa Bay railway. (2) A line, 
68 m. long from Witbank, a station on the Pretoria-Delagoa Bay 
line, to Brakpan on the Springs line. By (1) the distance between 
Johannesburg and Lourenco Marques is 364 m., by (2) 370 m. A 
continuation of the Springs-Breyten line eastward through Swaziland 
to Delagoa Bay will give a second independent railway from that 
port to the Rand, some 60 m. shorter than the route via Pretoria, 
while from Breyten a line (90 m. long) runs south and east to Ermelo 
and Piet Retief. (3) A line from Krugersdorp to Zeerust (128 m.). 
(4) A line from Pretoria to Rustenburg (61 m.). (5) A line from 
Pretoria to Pietersburg (177 m.). This line was continued (1910) 
north-west to effect a junction with (6) the " Selati " railway, which, 
starting from Komati Poort, runs north-west and was in 1910 
continued to Leydsdorp. North of the junction with the Pietersburg 
line the railway goes towards the Limpopo. (7) A line from Belfast 
on the Pretoria-Delagoa Bay railway to Lydenburg (65 m.). (8) A 
line from Potchefstroom to Lichtenburg (70 m.). 

There is an extensive telegraphic system linking the towns^ of 
the province to one another, and, through the surrounding countries, 
with Europe and the rest of the world. There is inland communica- 
tion via Rhodesia with British Central Africa and Ujiji on Lake 
Tanganyika. The telegraph lines within the Transvaal have^ a 
length of about 3000 m. There is a well-organized postal service 
with about 400 offices. In connexion with the postal services to 
outlying districts there is a public passenger service by mailcarts. 
In the Pictersbcrg district zebras are occasionally employed. 

Mineral Resources. — The Transvaal, the principal gold pro- 
ducing country in the world, is noted for the abundance and 
variety of its mineral resources. The minerals chiefly mined 
besides gold are diamonds and coal, but the country possesses 
also silver, iron, copper, lead, cobalt, sulphur, saltpetre and 
many other mineral deposits. 

Gold. — The principal gold-bearing reefs are found along the 
Witwatersrand (" The Rand "). Probably connected with the Rand

and Johannesburg, see the Geog. Journ., Dec. 1910. * 



reefs are the gold-bearing rocks in the Klerksdorp, Potchefstroom 
and Venterskroon districts. Other auriferous reefs are found all 
along the eastern escarpment of the Drakensberg and are worked 
in the De Kaap (Barberton) district, on the Swaziland frontier, in 
the Lydenburg district, in the Murchison Range and in other places 
in the Zoutpansberg. Goldfields also exist in the Waterberg and 
on the western frontier in the Marico district (the Malmani fields). 
The total value of the gold extracted from mines in the Transvaal 
up to the end of 1909 was about £246,000,000. 

a. The Witwatersrand and Neighbouring Mines. — The Rand reefs, 
first mined in 1886, cover a large area. ^ The main reef, continuously 
traced, measures about 62 m. and runs in an east and west direction. 
The gold is found in minute particles and in the richest ores the 
metal is rarely in visible quantities before treatment. In many 
places the main reef lies at a great depth and some bore-holes are 
over 5500 ft. deep. The yield of the Rand mines, in 1887 but 
23,000 oz.. rose in 1888 to 208,000 oz. In 1892 the yield was 
1,210,000 oz.: in 1896 it exceeded 2,280,000 oz. and in 1898 
was 4,295,000 oz.^ The war that followed prevented the proper 
working of the mines. In 1905 when a full supply of labour was 
again available the output was 4,760,000 oz., in which year the 
sum distributed in dividends to shareholders in the Rand mines 
was over £4,800,000. The total output from the Rand mines up 
to the end of 1908 was 56,477,240 oz. (see Gold, and Johannes- 
burg). The Klerksdorp and Potchefstroom goldfields, known also 
as the Western Rand, were proclaimed in 1887 and up to the close 
of 1908 had yielded 446,224 oz. 

b. TJie De Kaap {Barberton) Fields. — Gold was discovered in this 
district of the Drakensberg in 1875, but it was not until 1884 that 
the fields attracted much attention. The mines are, in general, 
situated on the slopes of the hills and are easily opened up by adits. 
The reefs are narrower than those of the Rand, and the ore is usually 
very hard. The output, 35,000 oz. in 1889, was 121,000 oz. in 
1896, but only 43,000 oz. in 1905. The total production (includ- 
ing *the Komati and Swaziland fields) to the end of 1908 was 
1,097,685 oz. 

c. The Lydenburg and other Fields. — The Lydenburg fields, re- 
ported to have been worked by the Portuguese in the 17th century, 
and rediscovered in 1869, though lying at an elevation of 4500 
to 5000 ft. are alluvial — and the only rich alluvial goldfields in South 
Africa. The ground containing the gold is soil which has escaped 
denudation. Though several large nuggets have been found (the 
largest weighing 215 oz.), the total production is not great, the 
highest output obtained by washing being worth about £300,000 
in one year. Besides the alluvial deposits a little mining is carried 
on, gold being present in the thin veins of quartz which cross the 
sandstone. The chief centres of the fields are Lydenburg, Pilgrims 
Rest and Spitzkop. The total output of the Lydenburg fields up 
to the end of 1908 is estimated at 1,200,000 oz. Farther north, 
in the Zoutpansberg and on its spurs are the little-worked mines 
generally known as the Low Country goldfields. Near Pietersburg 
in the Zoutpansberg is the Eersteling, the first mine worked in the 
Transvaal. Operations began in 1873 but in 1880 the machinery 
was destroyed by the Boers. It was not until 1904 that prospecting 
in the neighbourhood was again undertaken. The fields in the 
Waterberg and along the Malmani river are very small producers. 
The total yield to the end of 1908 of the Zoutpansberg, Low Country 
and other minor fields was 160,535 oz - 

Diamonds. — The chief diamond fields are in the Pretoria district. 
The ground was discovered to be diamondiferous in 1897, but it 
was not until 1903, when mining began on the Premier mine, situated 
20 m. north-east of Pretoria, that the wealth of the fields was proved. 
The site of the Premier mine had been recognized as diamond-bearing 
in March 1898. The owner of the land, a Boer named Prinsloo, 
refused to allow experimental spade work, but after the conclusion 
of the Anglo-Boer Warm 1902 sold his property for £55,000 to T. 
Cullinan (a Cape colonist and one of the chief contractors in the 
building of Johannesburg), whose faith in the richness of the ground 
was speedily justified. In June 1903 mining began and the diamonds 
found in the first five months realized over £90,000. On the 27th 
of January 1905, the largest diamond in the world, weighing 3025J 
carats, over ij lb avoirdupois, was found in the mine and named 
the Cullinan. The Premier mine is of the same character as the 
diamond mines at Kimberley (see Diamond), and is considerably 
larger. The area of the " pipe " containing blue ground is 
estimated at 350,000 sq. yds. 

Besides the Pretoria fields there are diamondiferous areas (alluvial 
diggings) in the Bloemhof district on the Vaal river north-east of 
Kimberley, and in other regions. In 1898 the output for the whole 
of the Transvaal was valued at £44,000. The output since the 
opening of the Premier mine has been: 1903-1904, £685,720; 
1904-1905, £1,198,530; 1905-1906, £968,229; 1906-1907, £2,203,511; 
1907-1908, £1,879,551; 1908-1909, £1,295,296. 

Coal and other Minerals. — There are extensive beds of good coal, 
including thick seams of steam coal near the Rand and other gold- 
fields. Coal appears to have been first discovered in the neighbour- 
hood of Bronkhorst Spruit between the Wilge and Olifants rivers, 
where it was so near the surface that farmers dug it up for their 
own use. In 1887 coal was found at Boksburg in the East Rand, 
and a mine was at once started. The principal collieries are those 



INDUSTRIES]

at Boksburg and at Brakpan, also on the East Rand, with a coal 
area of 2400 acres ; at Vereeniging and Klerksdorp, near the Vaal ; 
atWatervaal, 12 m. north of Pretoria; and in the Middelburg district, 
between Pretoria and Lourengo Marques. Like that of Natal the 
Transvaal coal burns with a clear flame and leaves little ash. The 
mines are free from gas and fire damp and none is more than 500 ft. 
deep. The output in 1893, the first year in which statistics are 
available, was 548,534 tons (of 2000 lb); in 1898 it was 1,907,808 
tons, and for the year ending 30th of June 1909 was 3,312,413 tons, 
valued at £851,150. 

Iron and copper are widely distributed. The Yzerberg near 
Marabastad in the Zoutpansberg consists of exceedingly rich iron 
ore, which has been smelted by the nat jfves for many centuries. Silver 
is found in many districts, and mines near Pretoria have yielded 
in one year ore worth £30,000. 

Salt is obtainable from the many pans in the plateaus, notably 
in the Zout(salt)pansberg, and was formerly manufactured in 
considerable quantities. 

Agriculture. — Next to mining agriculture is the most important 
industry. At the census of 1904 over 500,000 persons (excluding 
young children), or 37 % of the population, were returned as engaged 
in agriculture. Some 25 % more women than men were so employed, 
this preponderance being due to the^ large number of Kaffir women 
and the few native men who work in the mealie fields. The chief 
occupation of the majority of the white farmers is stock-raising. 
The high veld is admirably adapted for the raising of stock, its 
grasses being of excellent quality and the climate good. Even 
better pasture is found in the low veld, but^ there stock suffers in 
summer from many endemic diseases, and in the more northerly 
regions is subject to the attack of the tsetse fly. The banken veld 
is also unsuited in summer for horses and sheep, though cattle thrive. 
Much of the stock is moved from the lower to the higher regions 
according to the season. Among the high veld farmers the breeding 
of merino sheep is very popular. 

The amount of land under cultivation is very small in comparison 
with the area of the province. In 1904 only 951,802 acres, or 1*26% 
of the total acreage was under cultivation, and of the cultivated 
land nearly half was farmed by natives. The small proportion of 
land tilled is due to many causes, among which paucity of popula- 
tions is not the least. ^Moreover while large areas on the high veld 
are suitable for the raising of crops of a very varied character, in 
other districts, including a great part of the low veld, arable farming 
is impossible or unprofitable. Many regions suffer permanently 
from deficient rainfall; in^ others, owing to the absence of irrigation 
works, the water supply is lost, while the burning of the grass at 
the end of summer, a practice adopted by many farmers, tends to 
impoverish the soil and render it arid. The country suffers also 
from periods of excessive heat and general drought, while locusts 
occasionally sweep over the land, devouring every green thing. In 
some seasons the locusts, both red and brown, come in enormous 
swarms covering an area 5 m. broad and from 40 to 60 m. long. 
The chief method employed for their destruction is spraying the 
swarms with arsenic. The districts with the greatest area under 
cultivation are Heidelberg, Witwatersrand, Pretoria, Standerton 
and Krugersdorp. The chief crops grown for grain are wheat, 
maize (mealie) and kaffir corn, but the harvest is inadequate to 
meet local demands. Maize is the staple food of the Kaffirs. 
Since 1906 an important trade has also arisen in the raising of 
mealies for export by white farmers. Oats, barley and millet 
are largely grown for forage. Oats are cut shortly before reaching 
maturity, when they are known as oat-hay. The chief vegetables 
grown are potatoes, pumpkins, carrots, onions and tomatoes. 

Fruit farming is a thriving industry, the slopes of the plateaus 
and the river valleys being specially adapted for this culture. At 
the census of 1904 over 3,032,000 fruit trees were enumerated. There 
were 163,000 orange trees and nearly 60,000 other citrus trees, 
430,000 grape vines, 276,000 pine plants and 78,000 banana plants. 
Oranges are cultivated chiefly in the Rustenburg, Waterberg, 
Zoutpansberg and Pretoria districts, grapes in Potehefstroom, 
Pretoria and Marico, as well as in the Zoutpansberg and Waterberg, 
to which northern regions the cultivation of the banana is confined. 
In the tropical district of the Limpopo valley there is some cultiva- 
tion of the coffee-tree, and this region is also adapted for the growing 
of tea, sugar, cotton and rice. Tobacco is grown in every district, 
but chiefly in Rustenburg. Of the 3,032,000 lb of tobacco grown 
in 1904, Rustenburg produced 884,000 lb. 

A department of agriculture was established in 1902, and through 
its efforts great improvements have been made in the methods of 
farming. To further assist agriculture a land bank was established 
by the government in 1907 and an agricultural college in 1910. 

Land Settlement. — The land board is a government department 
charged with the control of Crown lands leased to settlers on easy 
terms for^ agricultural purposes. Between 1902 and 1907 about 
550 families were placed on the land, their holdings aggregating 
over 500,000 acres. The Crown lands cover in all about 21,500,000 
acres. Large areas of these lands, especially in the northern districts, 
are used as native reserves. 

Other Industries. — There are few manufacturing undertakings 
other than those connected with mining, agriculture and the develop- 
ment of Johannesburg. There is a large factory for the supply of 



dynamite to the gold mines. The building and construction trade 
is an important industry on the Rand, where there are also brick- 
works, iron and brass foundries, breweries and distilleries. There 
are a number of flour mills and jam factories in various centres. 
A promising home industry, started under English auspices after 
the war of 1899-1902, is the weaving by women of rugs, carpets, 
blankets, &c, from native wool. 

Export and Import Trade. — Before the discovery of gold the irade 
of the Transvaal was of insignificant proportions. This may be 
illustrated by the duties paid on imports, which in 1880 amounted 
to £20,306. In 1887 when the gold-mining industry was in its infancy 
the duty on imports had risen to £190,792, and in 1897, when the 
industry was fully developed, to £1,280,039. The Anglo-Boer War 
completely disorganized trade, but the close of the contest was marked 
by feverish activity and the customs receipts in 1902-1903 rose to 
£2,176,658. A period of depression followed, the average annual 
receipts for the next three years being £1,683,159. In 1908-1909 
they were £1,588,960. 

The chief exports are gold and diamonds. Of the total exports 
in 1908, valued at £33.323.000, gold was worth £29,643,000 and dia- 
monds £1,977,000. Next in value came wool (£226,000), horses 
and mules (£110,000), skins, hides and horns (£106,000), tobacco 
(£89,000), tin, coal, copper and lead. The gold and diamonds are 
sent to England via Cape Town; the other exports go chiefly to 
Delagoa Bay. The imports, valued at £16,196,000 in 1908, include 
goods of every kind. Machinery,, provisions, largely in the form 
of tinned and otherwise preserved food, and liquors, clothing, textiles 
and hardware, chemicals and dynamite, iron and steel work and 
timber, and jewelry are the chief items in the imports. Of the 
imports about 50% comes from Great Britain and about 20% from 
British colonies (including other South African states). Half the 
imports reach the Transvaal through the Portuguese port of Lourengo 
Marques, Durban taking 25 % and the Cape ports the remainder. 
There is free trade between the Transvaal and the other British 
possessions in South Africa, and for external trade they all adhere 
to a Customs Union which, *as fixed in 1906, imposes a general 
ad valorem duty of 15% on most goods save machinery, on which 
the duty is 3 %. A rebate of 3 % is granted on imports from Great 
Britain. 

Constitution. — The existing constitution dates from 1910. 
The province is represented in the Union Parliament by eight 
senators and thirty-six members of the House of Assembly. 
For parliamentary purposes the province is divided into single- 
member constituencies. Every adult white male British subject 
is entitled to the franchise, subject to a six months' residential 
qualification. 1 There is no property qualification. All electors 
are eligible to the assembly. Voters are registered biennially, 
and every five years there is an automatic redistribution of 
seats on a voters' basis. 

Central Government. — At the head of the executive is a provincial 
administrator, appointed by the Union ministry, who holds office 
for five years and is assisted by an executive committee of four 
members elected by the provincial council. The provincial council 
consists of 36 members elected for the same constituencies and 
by the same electorate as are the members of the House of 
Assembly. The provincial council, which has strictly local 
powers, sits for a statutory period of three years. The control 
of elementary education was guaranteed to the provincial 
council for a period of five years from the establishment of 
the Union. 

In May 1903 an inter-colonial council was established to 
deal with the administration of the railways in the Transvaal 
and Orange River Colony (known as the Central South African 
railways), the South African constabulary and other matters 
common to the Orange River and Transvaal t colonies. This 
council was presided over by the governor of the Transvaal and 
formed an important part of the administrative machinery. 
By agreement between the two colonies the council was dis- 
solved in 1908. In 1910 the control of the railways passed to 
the harbours and railway board of the Union of South Africa. 

Local Government. — The unit of administration is the field 
cornetcy. The semi-military organization of these divisions, 
which existed under the South African republic, has been 
abolished, and field-cornets, who are nominated by the pro- 
vincial government, are purely civil officials charged with the 
registration of voters, births and deaths, the maintenance of 
public roads, &c. The chief local authorities are the municipal 
bodies, many " municipalities " being rural areas centred 
round a small town. The municipal boards possess very

wide powers of local government. The Witwatersrand munici- 
palities are for certain purposes combined into one authority, 
and representatives of these municipalities, together with repre- 
sentatives of the chamber of mines, compose the Rand water 
board. The basis of municipal qualification is ownership of 
real property of the value of £100, or the tenancy of premises 
of the value of £300, or annual value of £24. Neither aliens 
nor coloured British subjects can exercise the franchise. 

Finance. — In 1883, before the Rand gold mines had been found 
revenue and expenditure were about £150,000; in 1887, when the 
mines were beginning to be developed, the receipts were £668,000 and 
the expenditure £721,000; in 1889 the receipts had risen to £1,577,000 
and the expenditure to £1,226,000. In 1894 the receipts first 
exceeded two millions, the figures for that year being: revenue 
£2,247,000, expenditure £1 ,734,000. The figures for the four follow- 
ing years were : —

The public debt of the Boer government was £2,500,000. In 
1899 war broke out and the finances of the country were disorganized. 
The accounts of the colony began, for normal purposes, with the 
year ending 30th of June 1903, and ended in June 1910 on the 
establishment of the Union. In May 1903 a loan of £35,000,000, 
guaranteed by the imperial government and secured on the general 
revenues of the Transvaal and Orange River colonies, was issued 
to the extent of £30,000,000, the balance being raised about the 
middle of 1904. This loan bears interest at 3 % per annum, with 
a sinking fund of 1%, and as to the £30,000,000 was issued at 
par, the £5,000,000 being put up to tender and realizing an average 
price of £98, 1 os. 3d. The principal head in the allocation of this loan 
was the purchase of the railways in'the two colonies at a cost of 
£13,520,000, while an additional £5,958,000 was devoted to the 
building of new lines, purchases of rolling stock, &c. The debt of 
the South African Republic was paid off; £542,000 went to make 

food the deficit on the administration for 1901-1902; the sum of 
1,561,000 was paid to burghers of the Cape Colony and Natal as 
compensation for war losses; £3,000,000 was devoted to land settle- 
ment schemes and £2,000,000 to public works other than railways. 
The railways were treated as the common property of both colonies, 
and to administer them and other common services the inter-colonial 
council was created. In addition to the charges enumerated 
£5,000,000 were spent out of the loan on " repatriation and compensa- 
tion " of burghers who had suffered during the war. 1 In addition 
to the £35,000,000 guaranteed loan of 1903-1904 two small loans 
for land settlement and public works, together amounting to £254,800, 
were issued, and in 1907 an imperial guarantee was given For the 
raising of another loan, of £5,000,000, by the colonial government. 
The act authorizing the loan devoted £2,500,000 to the establishment 
of a land and agricultural bank, and £2,500,000 to railways, public 
works, irrigation and agricultural settlement and development. 
The loan was raised, as to £4,000,000, in January 1909, the average 
price obtained being £96, 3s. 7d. 

The chief sources of revenue are customs, mining royalties, 
railways, native revenue (poll tax and passes), posts and tele- 
graphs, stamp and transfer duties, land revenue and taxes on 
trades and professions. A tax of 10% is levied on the annual 
net produce of all gold workings (proclamation of 1902) and the 
government takes 60% of the profits on diamond mines. In 
1907 an excise duty was, for the first time, levied on beer. The 
principal heads of expenditure are on railways and other public 
works, including posts and telegraphs, justice, education, police, 
land settlement and agriculture generally, mines and native 
affairs. Since June 1910 the control of state finance passed 
to the Union parliament, but the Transvaal provincial council 
is empowered to raise revenue for provincial purposes by direct 
taxation and, with the consent of the Union government, to 
borrow money on the sole credit of the province. 

In the five years 1902-1907 the average annual receipts and 
expenditure amounted to £4,500,000, exclusive of the sums 
received and expended on account of the loans mentioned. 
The inter-colonial council received and spent in the four years 
1903-1907 over £21,500,000, including some £3,500,000 paid 
in from revenue by the Transvaal and Orange River colonies 
to make good deficits. Fully two-thirds of the rev enue and 

1 Besides this £5,000,000 an additional sum of £9,500,000 was 
spent by the imperial government in relieving the necessities of 
those who had suffered during the war, but of this £9,500,000 the 
sum of £2,500,000 was in payment for goods received. 



expenditure of the Council was derived from and spent upon 
the Transvaal, so that had the accounts of the two colonies been 
entirely distinct the figures of the Transvaal budget for 1903- 
1907 would have balanced at about £8,500,000 a year. In July 
1907 when the control of the finances passed into the hands of 
the Transvaal legislature the credit balance on the consolidated 
fund was £960,000. In 1908 the inter-colonial council was 
dissolved, but the railways continued to be administered 
as a joint concern by a railway board on which the governments 
of both colonies were represented. This board in 1910 handed 
over its duties to the harbour and railway board of the Union. 
The Transvaal revenue (apart from railway receipts) in 1908- 
1909 was £5,735,000, the corresponding expenditure £4,524,000. 
The budget figures for 1900-1910 were: revenue £5,943,000; 
expenditure £5,231,000. The diamond revenue yielded £235,000 
and the gold profits tax £965,000. The balance handed over 
to the Union government was £1,015,000. 

Justice— The laws are based on Roman-Dutch law, as modified 
by local acts. Courts of first instance are presided over by magis- 
trates, the whole colony being divided into sixteen magisterial 
wards. There is a provincial division of the Supreme Court of 
South Africa sitting at Pretoria (consisting of a judge president 
and six puisne justices) with original and appellate jurisdiction in 
civil and criminal matters. A local division; of the Supreme Court, 
formerly known as the Witwatersrand high court (consisting of 
one or more judges of the Supreme Court) sits permanently at 
Johannesburg^ and has civil and criminal jurisdiction throughout 
the Rand. Circuit courts are held as occasion requires. 

Police.— ^Pretoria, and Johannesburg have their own police forces. 
The rest of the province is policed by the South African constabulary, 
a body 3700 strong, to which is also entrusted customs preventive 
work, fire brigade work and such like functions. 

Education. — Since 1910 education other than elementary is under 
the control of the Union parliament. The provincial council is 
responsible for elementary education. At the head of the permanent 
staff is a director of education. School boards and district committees 
are formed, but their functions are almost entirely advisory. In 
accordance with the terms of the Education Act of 1907 of the 
Transvaal colony, state schools are provided for the free instruction 
of all white children in elementary subjects. Attendance at school 
between the ages of 7 and 14 is, with certain exceptions, compulsory. 
The medium of instruction in the lower standards is the mother 
tongue of the children. Above standard III. English is the medium 
of instruction. No religious tests are imposed on teachers and re- 
ligious teaching is confined to undenominational Bible teaching. No 
government grants are given to private schools. (In 1906 members 
of the Dutch community established a " Christian National Educa- 
tion 'organization and opened a number of denominational schools.) 
Secondary education is provided in the towns and high schools 
are maintained at Pretoria, Johannesburg and Potchefstroom. 
There are University colleges at Pretoria and Johannesburg. 
Education of the natives is chiefly in the hands of the missionaries, 
but the government gives grants in aid to over 100 schools for natives. 
At the census of 1904 the natives able to read formed less than 1 % 
of the population. At the same census 95 % of the white population 
over 21 were able to read and write; of the whites between the ages 
of 5 and ia 59 % could read and write. 

State schools for white children were established by the Boer 
government, and in the last year (1898) before the British occupation 
there were 509 schools and 14,700 scholars, the education vote 
that year being £226,000. In 1902 the property vested in various 
school committees was transferred to government and control of 
the schools vested in a department of state. In 1909 there were 
670 government elementary schools, with more than 42,000 scholars.

Religion.— Oi the total population 26-69% are Christians, and 
of the Christians 80% are whites. No fewer than 70% of the 
people, including the bulk of the natives, are officially returned as 
of 4 no religion. ' Of the 336,869 Christians 69,738 were natives. 
Nearly half of the white community, 142,540 persons, belong to 
one or other of the Dutch Churches in the Transvaal, but they 
have only 4305 native members. Of Dutch Churches the first and 
chief is the Nederduitsch Hervormde, Kerk, founded by the Voor- 
trekkers and originally the state Church. The others are the Neder- 
duitsch Gereformeerde Kerk, an offshoot of the Church of the same 
name at the Cape, and the Gereformeerde Kerk (the " Dopper " 
Church) with some iK.ooo members and adherents in the Transvaal. 
Jhe Dopper " Church, an offshoot of the Separatist Re- 
formed Church of Holland, is distinguished from the other Dutch 
churches in being more rigidly Calvinistic and " Biblical/* and 
in not using hymns. A " Scouts " Church was formed at the end 
of the war of 1890-1902 by burghers who had previously acted as 

National Scouts and were ostracized by the synods of their former 
Churches. After some years of friction " National Scouts " were 
however readmitted, on terms, to their former membership.

a distinct district command under a major-general. 

A volunteer force was established in 1904, for service within the 
Transvaal, or wherever the interests of the country might require. 
The force, disciplined and organized by a permanent staff of officers 
and non-commissioned officers of the regular army, is about 6500 
strong, and consistsof a brigade of artillery, four mounted, three 
composite and four infantry corps, a cyclist corps, &c. There are 
also cadet companies some 3000 strong. (F. R. C.) 

History 

A. Foundation of the Republic. — At the beginning of the 
19th century the country now known as the Transvaal was 
inhabited, apparently somewhat sparsely, by Bavenda and other 
Bantu negroes, and in the south-west by wandering Bushmen 
and Hottentots. About 1817 the country was invaded by the 
chieftain Mosilikatze and his impis, who were fleeing from the 
vengeance of Chaka, king of the Zulus. The inhabitants were 
unable to withstand the attacks of the disciplined Zulu warriors — 
or Matabele, as they were henceforth called — by whom large 
areas of central and western Transvaal were swept bare. The 
remnants of the Bavenda retreated north to the Waterberg 
and Zoutpansberg, while Mosilikatze made his chief kraal at 
Mosega, not far from the site of the town of Zeerust. At that 
time the region between the Vaal and Limpopo was scarcely 
known to Europeans. In 1829, however, Mosilikatze was 
visited at Mosega by Robert Moffat, and between that date 
and 1836 a few British traders and explorers visited the country 
and made known its principal features. Such was the situation 
when Boer emigrants first crossed the Vaal. 

The causes which led to the exodus of large numbers of 
Dutch farmers from Cape Colony are discussed elsewhere (see 
South Africa and Cape Colony). Here it is only necessary 
to state that the Voortrekkers were animated by an intense 
desire to be altogether rid of British control, and to be allowed 
to set up independent communities and govern the natives 
in such fashion as they saw fit. The first party to cross the 
Vaal consisted of 98 persons under the leadership of Louis 
Trichard and Jan van Rensburg. They left Cape Colony in 
1835 and trekked to the Zoutpansberg. Here Rensburg's party 
separated from the others, but were soon afterwards murdered 
by natives. 1 Trichard's party determined to examine the 
country between the Zoutpansberg and Delagoa Bay. Fever 
carried off several of their number, and it was not until 1838 
that the survivors reached the coast. Eventually they pro- 
ceeded by boat to Natal. Meantime, in 1836, another party 
of farmers under Andries Hendrik Potgieter had established 
their headquarters on the banks of the Vet river. Potgieter 
and some companions followed the trail of Trichard's party as 
Potgieter. * ar as t ^ ie Zoutpansberg, where they were shown 
gold workings by the natives and saw rings of 
gold made by native workmen. They also ascertained that a 
trade between the Kaffirs and the Portuguese at Delagoa Bay 
already existed. On returning to the Vet, Potgieter learned that 
a hunting party of Boers which had crossed the Vaal had been 
attacked by the Matabele, who had also killed Boer women and 
children. This act led to reprisals, and on the 17th of January 
1837 a Boer commando surprised Mosilikatze's encampment at 
Mosega, inflicting heavy loss on the Matabele without themselves

1867 they were given over to the Boer government by the Swazis,

losing a man. In November of the same year Mosilikatze 
suffered further heavy losses at the hands of the Boers, and 
early in 1838 he fled north beyond the Limpopo, never to 
retunu Potgieter, after the flight of the Matabele, issued a pro- 
clamation in which he declared the country which Mosilikatze 
had abandoned forfeited to the emigrant farmers. After the 
Matabele peril had been removed, many farmers trekked 
across the Vaal and occupied parts ,of the district left derelict. 
Into these depopulated areas there was also a considerable 
immigration of Basuto, Bechuana and other Bantu tribes. 

The first permanent white settlement north of the Vaal was 
made by a party under Potgieter's leadership. That com- 
mandant had in March 1838 gone to Natal, and had 
endeavoured to avenge the massacre of Piet Retief and his com- 
rades by the Zulus. Jealous, however, of the preference shown 
by the Dutch farmers in Natal to another commandant (Gert 
Maritz), Potgieter speedily recrossed the Drakensberg, and in 
November 1838 he and his followers settled by the banks of the 
Mooi river, founding a town named Potchefstroom in honour 
of Potgieter. This party instituted an elementary form of 
government, and in 1840 entered into a loose confederation with 
the Natal Boers, and also with the Boers south of the Vaal, 
whose headquarters were at Winburg. In 1842, however, 
Potgieter's party declined to go to the help of the Natal Boers, 
then involved in conflict with the British. Up to 1845 Pot- 
gieter continued to exercise authority over the Boer communities 
on both sides of the Vaal. A determination to keep clear of 
the British and to obtain access to the outer world through an 
independent channel led Potgieter and a considerable number of 
the Potchefstroom and Winburg burghers in 1845 to migrate 
towards Delagoa Bay. Potgieter settled in the Zoutpansberg, 
while other farmers chose as headquarters a place on the inner 
slopes of the Drakensberg, where they founded a village called 
Andries Ohrigstad. It proved fever-ridden and was abandoned, 
a new village being laid out on higher ground and named Lyden- 
burg in memory of their sufferings at the abandoned settlement. 

Meantime the southern districts abandoned by Potgieter and 
his comrades were occupied by other Boers. These were joined 
in 1848 by Andries W. J. Pretorius (q.v.), who became com- 
mandant of the Potchefstroom settlers. When the British go- 
vernment decided to recognize the independence of the Transvaal 
Boers it was with Pretorius that negotiations were The Sand 
conducted. On the* 17th of January 1852 a con- River 
vention was signed at a farm near the Sand Convention. 
river in the Orange sovereignty by assistant commissioners 
nominated by the British high commissioner on the one hand, 
and by Pretorius and other Boers on the other. The first clause 
was in the following terms: — 

The assistant commissioners guarantee in the fullest manner, on 
the part of the British government, to the emigrant farmers beyond 
the Vaal river, the right to manage their own affairs, and to govern 
themselves according to their own laws, without any interference 
on the part of the British government, and that no encroachment 
shall be made by the said government on the territory beyond to 
the north of the Vaal river, with the further assurance that the 
warmest wish of the British government is to promote peace, free 
trade, and friendly intercourse with the emigrant farmers now 
inhabiting, or who hereafter may inhabit, that country; it being 
understood that this system of non-interference is binding upon 
both parties. 

At this time there were settled north of the Vaal about 5000 
families of European extraction — about 40,000 persons, in- 
cluding young children. They had obtained independence, 
but they were far from being a united people. When Pretorius 
conducted the negotiations which led to the signing of the Sand 
River Convention he did so without consulting the volksraad, 
and Potgieter's party accused him of usurping power and aiming 
at domination over the whole country. However, the volks- 
raad, at a meeting held at Rustenburg on the 16th of March 
1852, ratified the convention, Potgieter and Pretorius having 
been publicly reconciled on the morning of the same day. 
Both leaders were near the end of their careers; Potgieter died 
in March and Pretorius in July 1853.

[THE FIRST REPUBLIC 



in regard to what they considered their territorial rights, and 
in the interval between the signing of the Sand River Convention 
and the death of Pretorius an incident occurred significant 
alike of their claims to jurisdiction over enormous areas and of 
their manner of treating the natives. Within a few weeks 
of the signing of the convention Pretorius had asked the British 
authorities to close the " lower road " to the interior, that is 
the route through Bechuanaland, opened up by Moffat, Living- 
stone and other missionaries. Pretorius alleged that by this 
means the natives were obtaining firearms. At the same time the 
Transvaal Boers claimed that all the Bechuana country belonged 
to them, a claim which the British government of that day 
did not think it worth while to contest. No boundary west- 
ward had been indicated in the Sand River Convention. The 
Barolong, Bakwena and other Bechuana tribes, through whose 
lands the " lower road " ran, claimed however to be independent, 
among them Sechele (otherwise Setyeli), at whose chief kraal — 
Kolobeng — Livingstone was then stationed. Sechele was 
regarded by the Boers as owing them allegiance, and in August 
1852 Pretorius sent against him a commando (in which Paul 
Kruger served as a field cornet), alleging that the Bakwena were 
harbouring a Bakatla chief who had looted cattle belonging 
to Boer farmers. It was in this expedition that Livingstone's 
house was looted. There was little fighting, but the commando 
carried off between two and three hundred native women 
and children — some of whom were redeemed by their friends, 
and some escaped, while many of the children were apprenticed 
to farmers. Sechele's power was not broken, and he appealed 
for British protection, which was not then granted. The 
incident was, however, but the first step in the struggle for the 
possession of that country (see Bechuanaland). It served to 
strengthen the unfavourable impression formed in England of 
the Transvaal Boers with regard to their treatment of the 
natives; an impression which was deepened by tidings of terrible 
chastisement of tribes in the Zoutpansberg, and by the Appren- 
tice Law passed by the volksraad in 1856— a law denounced in 
many quarters as practically legalizing slavery. 

On the death of Andries Pretorius his son Marthinus W. 
Pretorius (q.v.) had been appointed his successor, and to the 
younger Pretorius was due the first efforts to end the discord 
and confusion which prevailed among the burghers — a discord 
heightened by ecclesiastical strife, the points at issue being 
questions not of faith but of church government. In 1856 
a series of public meetings, summoned by Pretorius, was held 
at different districts in the Transvaal for the purpose of dis- 
cussing and deciding whether the time had not arrived for 
substituting a strong central government in place of the petty 
district governments which had hitherto existed. The result 
was that a representative assembly of delegates was elected, 
p&tchef- empowered to draft a constitution. In December 
stroom this assembly met at Potchefstroom, and for three 
Assembly, weeks was engaged in modelling the constitution 
1856. £ t jj e coun try. The name " South African 

Republic " was adopted as the title of the state, and the 
new constitution made provision for a volksraad to which 
members were to be elected by the people for a period of 
two years, and in which the legislative function was vested. 
The administrative authority was to be vested in a president, 
aided by an executive council. It was stipulated that mem- 
bers both of the volksraad and council should be members 
of the Dutch Reformed Church, and of European blood. 
No equality of coloured people with the white inhabitants 
would be tolerated either in church or state. In reviewing 
an incident so important in the history of the Transvaal 
as the appointment of the Potchefstroom assembly it is 
of interest to note the gist of the complaint among the 
Boers which led to this revolution in the government of the 
country as it had previously existed. In his History of South 
Africa Theal says: " The community of Lydenburg was accused 
of attempting to domineer over the whole country, without any 
other right to pre-eminence than that of being composed of the 
earliest inhabitants, a right which it had forfeited by its opposi- 



tion to the general weal." In later years this complaint was 
precisely that of the Uitlanders at Johannesburg. To conciliate 
the Boers of Zoutpansberg the new-born assembly at Potchef- 
stroom appointed Stephanus Schoeman, the commandant- 
general of the Zoutpansberg district, commandant-general 
of the whole country. This offer was, however, declined by 
Schoerran, and both Zoutparisberg and Lydenburg indignantly 
repudiated the new assembly and its constitution. The execu- 
tive council, which had been appointed by the Potchefstroom 
assembly, with Pretorius as president, now took up a bolder 
attitude: they deposed Schoeman from all authority, declared 
Zoutpansberg in a state of blockade, and denounced the Boers 
of the two northern districts as rebels. 

Further to strengthen their position, Pretorius and his party 
unsuccessfully endeavoured to bring about a union with the 
Orange Free State. Peaceful overtures having failed, Pretorius 
and Paul Kruger placed themselves at the head of a commando 
which crossed the Vaal with the object of enforcing presidency 
union, but the Free State compelled their with- f 
drawal (see Orange Free State). Within the Marthinus 
Transvaal the forces making for union gained strength Pretorius * 
notwithstanding these events, and by the year i860 Zoutpansberg 
and Lydenburg had become incorporated with the republic. 
Pretoria, newly founded, and named in honour of the elder 
Pretorius, was made the seat of government and capital of 
the country. The ecclesiastical efforts at unity had not been 
equally successful. The Separatist Reformed Church of Holland 
had sent out a young expositor of its doctrines named Postma, 
who, in November 1858, became minister of Rustenburg. In 
the following year a general church assembly endeavoured 
to unite all the congregations in a common government, but 
Postma's consistory rejected these overtures, and from that 
date the Separatist (or Dopper) Church has had an independent 
existence (see ante, § Religion). Paul Kruger, who lived near 
Rustenburg, became a strong adherent of the new church. 

Pretorius, while still president of the Transvaal, had been 
elected, through the efforts of his partisans, president of the 
Orange Free State. He thereupon (in February i860) obtained 
six months' leave of absence and repaired to Bloemfontein, in 
the hope of peacefully bringing about a union between the two 
republics. He had no sooner left the Transvaal than the old 
Lydenburg party, headed by Cornells Potgieter, landdrost of 
Lydenburg, protested that the union would he much internal 
more beneficial to the Free State than to the people of Dissen* 
Lydenburg, and followed this up with the contention sioDS * 
that it was illegal for any one to be president of the South 
African Republic and the Free State at the same time. At the 
end of the six months Pretorius, after a stormy meeting of the 
volksraad, apparently in disgust at the whole situation, resigned 
the presidency of the Transvaal. J. H. Grobelaar, who had been 
appointed president during the temporary absence of Pretorius, 
was requested to remain in office. The immediate followers of 
Pretorius now became extremely incensed at the action of the 
Lydenburg party, and a mass meeting was held at Potchef- 
stroom (October i860), where it was resolved that: (a) the 
volksraad no longer enjoyed its confidence; (b) that Pretorius 
should remain president of the South African Republic, and 
have a year's leave of absence to bring about union with the 
Free State; (c) that Schoeman should act as president during 
the absence of Pretorius; (d) that before the return of Pretorius 
to resume his duties a new volksraad should be elected. 

If at this stage of their existence the real ambition of the 
Transvaal Boers was to found a strong and compact republican 
state, their conduct in opposing a scheme of union with the 
Orange Free State was foolish to a degree. The events of the 
year i860, as well as of all the years that followed down to British 
annexation in 1877, show that licence rather than liberty, a narrow 
spirit of faction rather than patriotism, were the dominant in- 
stincts of the Boer. Had the fusion of the two little republics 
which Pretorius sought to bring about, and from which apparently 
the Free State was not averse, actually been accomplished in 
i860, it is more than probable that a republican state on liberal

lines, with some prospect of permanence and stability, might 
have been formed. But a narrow, distrustful, grasping policy 
on the part of whatever faction might be dominant at the time 
invariably prevented the state from acquiring stability and 
security at any stage of its history. 

The complications that ensued on the action of the Pretorius 
party subsequent to his resignation were interminable and 
complicated. Some of the new party were arraigned for treason 
and fined; and for several months there were two acting 
presidents and two rival governments within the Transvaal. 
At length Commandant Paul Kruger called out the burghers 
of his district and entered into the strife. Having driven 
Schoeman and his followers from Pretoria, Kruger invaded 
Potchefstroom, which, after a skirmish in which three men 
were killed and seven wounded, fell into his hands. He 
then pursued Schoeman, who doubled on his opponent and 
entered Potchefstroom. A temporary peace was no sooner 
secured than Commandant Jan Viljoen rose in revolt and 
engaged Kruger's forces. Viljoen's commando, with which 
Pretorius was in sympathy, was known as the Volksleger, or 
Army of the People. Kruger's force called itself the Staatsleger 
or Army of the State. Pretorius in r863 resigned his Free State 
presidency and offering himself as mediator (not for the first time) 
succeeded at length in putting a period to the confused series 
of intestine quarrels. In January 1864 a conference, which 
lasted six days, was held between the parties and an agreement 
was reached. This was followed by a new election for president, 
and once more Pretorius was called upon to fill that office. 
Kruger was appointed commandant-general. 

Civil strife for a time was at an end, but the injuries inflicted 
on the state were deep and lasting. The public funds were 
exhausted; taxes were impossible to collect; and the natives 
on the borders of the country and in the mountains of the north 
had thrown off all allegiance to the state. The prestige of the 
country was practically gone, not only with the world outside, 
but, what was of still more moment, with her neighbour the Free 
State, which felt that a federation with the Transvaal, which the 
Free State once had sought but which it now forswore, was an

Boers. <py s c h ar g e was no t without some justification. It 

is true that laws prohibiting slavery were in existence, but the 
Boer who periodically took up arms against his own appointed 
government was not likely to be, nor was he, restrained by laws. 
Natives were openly transferred from one Boer to another, and 
the fact that they were described as apprentices by the farmers 
did not in the least alter the status of the native, who to all 
intents and purposes became the property of his master. These 
apprentices, mostly bought from slave traders when little 
children, formed, however, a very small proportion of the native 
population, and after some fifteen years' servitude were usually 
allowed their freedom. Natives enjoying tribal government were 
not enslaved, but nothing could exceed in ferocity the measures 
taken to reduce ' recalcitrant tribes to submission. Educa- 
tion, as need hardly be said, was in the 'sixties at a very low 
ebb, and nothing approaching the standard of a high school 
existed. The private tutor was a good deal in demand, but 
his qualifications were of the slightest. An unsuccessful 
European carpenter or other mechanic, or even labourer, not 
infrequently occupied this position. At the various churches 
such elementary schools as existed were to be found, but they 
did not profess to teach more than a smattering of the three 
" R's " and tbe principles of Christianity. 

In 1865 an empty exchequer called for drastic measures, and 
the volksraad determined to endeavour to meet their liabilities

1865-8* j n tn j s same vear the farmers of the Zoutpansberg 

district were driven into laagers by a native rising which they 
were unable to suppress. Schoemansdal, a village at the foot 



of the Zoutpansberg, was the most important settlement of the 
district, and the most advanced outpost in European occupation 
at that time in South Africa. It was just within the tropics, and 
was situated in a well-watered and beautiful country. It was 
used as a base by hunters and traders with the interior, and in its 
vicinity there gathered a number of settlers of European origin, 
many of them outcasts from Europe or Cape Colony. They 
earned the reputation of being the most lawless white inhabitants 
in the whole of South Africa. When called upon to go to the 
aid of this settlement, which in 1 865-1866 was sore pressed by 
one of the mountain Bantu tribes known as the Baramapulana, 
the burghers of the southern Transvaal objected that the white 
inhabitants of that region were too lawless and reckless a body to 
merit their assistance. In 1867 Schoemansdal and a considerable 
portion of the district were abandoned on the advice of Com- 
mandant-general Paul Kruger, and Schoemansdal finally was 
burnt to ashes by a party of natives. It was not until 1869 that 
peace was patched up, and the settlement arrived at left the 
mountain tribes in practical independence. Meanwhile the 
public credit and finances of the Transvaal went from bad to 
worse. The paper notes already issued had been constituted by 
law legal tender for all debts, but in 1868 their power of actual 
purchase was only 30% compared with that of gold, and by 1870 
it had fallen as low as 25%. Civil servants, who were paid in 
this depreciated scrip, suffered considerable distress. The revenue 
for 1869 was stated as £31,511; the expenditure at £30,836. 

The discovery of gold at Tati led President Pretorius in April 
1868 to issue a proclamation extending his territories on the west 
and north so as to embrace the goldfield and all Efforts to 
Bechuanaland. The same proclamation extended obtain a 
Transvaal territory on the east so as to include part Sea P ort * 
of Delagoa Bay. The eastern extension claimed by Pretorius 
was the sequel to endeavours made shortly before, on the initia- 
tive of a Scotsman, to develop trade along the rivers leading to 
Delagoa Bay. It was also in accord with the desire of the Trans- 
vaal Boers to obtain a seaport, a desire which had led them as 
early as i860 to treat with the Zulus for the possession of St 
Lucia Bay. That effort had, however, failed. And now the 
proclamation of Pretorius was followed by protests on the part 
of the British high commissioner, Sir Philip Wodehouse, as well 
as on the part of the consul-general for Portugal in South Africa. 
The boundary on the east was settled by a treaty with Portugal 
in 1869, the Boers abandoning their claim to Delagoa Bay; that 
on the west was dealt with in 1871. 

The Sand River Convention of 1852 had not defined the western 
border of the state, and the discovery of gold at Tati to the north- 
west, together with the discovery of diamonds on the Vaal in 
1867, offered Pretorius every inducement to extend his boundary. 
Although to-day the great diamond mines are south of the Vaal 
River, the early discoveries of diamonds were made chiefly on the 
northern bank of the Vaal, near the site of the town now known 
as Barkly West. This territory was claimed by the 
South African Republic, by Barolong and Batlapin A^ard. 
Bechuanas, by Koranas, and also by David Arnot, on 
behalf of the Griqua captain, Nicholas Waterboer. To settle the 
boundary question an arbitration court was appointed consisting 
of a Transvaal landdrost, A. A. O'Reilly, on behalf of the South 
African Republic, and John Campbell on behalf of the other 
claimants, with Lieutenant-Governor Keate of Natal as referee. 
The judges disagreed, and the final decision, afterwards known 
as the Keate award, was given by the referee on the 17th of 
October 1871. The decision was in favour of Waterboer, who 
had, on the 25th of August 1870, before the appointment of the 
arbitration court, offered his territory to Great Britain, and it was 
understood by all the parties interested that that offer would be 
accepted. The award, admittedly just on the evidence before 
Keate, placed, however, outside the territory of the republic the 
Bloemhof district, in which district Boer farmers were settled, and 
over which the Pretoria government had for some years exercised 
jurisdiction. A few days after the publication of the Keate 
award Sir Henry Barkly, the British high commissioner, issued 
proclamations taking over Waterboer's territory under the

title of Griqualand West (q.v.). The eastern boundary of the 
new territory was made to include the region between the 
Harts river and the Vaal, in which the diamond diggings 
were situated, but not the Bloemhof district. To this district 
Sir Henry Barkly asserted the British rights, but no steps were 
taken to enforce them and as a matter of fact the Bloemhof 
district continued to be part of the Transvaal. 

The award caused a strong feeling of resentment among the 
Boers, and led to the resignation of President Pre tonus and his 
executive. The Boers now cast about to find a man who 
should have the necessary ability, as they said, to negotiate on 
equal terms with the British authorities should any future dis- 
pute arise. With this view they asked Mr (afterwards Sir 
Burgers John) Brand, president, of the Free State, to allow 
becomes them to nominate him for the presidency of the 
President, South African Republic. To this President Brand 
would not consent. He recognized that, even at 
this early stage of their history, the Transvaal Boers were 
filled with the wildest ideas as to what steps they would take 
in the future to counteract the influence of Great Britain. Brand 
intimated to many of the leading Transvaal Boers that in his 
opinion they were embarking on a rash and mistaken policy. 
He urged that their true interests lay in friendship with, not in 
hostility to, Great Britain and the British. Having failed with 
Brand, the Boers invited the Rev. Thomas Francois Burgers, 
a member of a well-known Cape Colony family and a minister 
of the Dutch Reformed Church, to allow himself to be nomi- 
nated. Burgers accepted the offer, and in 1872 was elected 
president. About this time gold reefs were discovered in 
the Zoutpansberg district near Marabastad, and a few gold 
seekers from Europe and Cape Colony began to prospect the 
northern portions of the Transvaal. The miners and prospectors 
did not, however, exceed a few hundred for several years. 

The appointment of Burgers to the presidency in 1872 was 
a new departure. He was able, active and enlightened, hut 
he was a visionary rather than a man of affairs or sound 
judgment. Instead of reducing chaos to order and concentrat- 
ing his attention, as Brand had done in the Free State, on 
establishing security and promoting industry, he took up, with 
all its entanglements, the policy of intrigues with native chiefs 
beyond the border and the dream of indefinite expansion. 
In 1875 Burgers proceeded to Europe with the project of raising 
a loan for the construction of a railway to Delagoa Bay. He 
was empowered by the volksraad to raise £300,000, but with 
great difficulty he obtained in Holland the sum of £90,000 only, 
and that at a high rate of interest. With this inadequate sum 
some railway plant was obtained, and subsequently lay for ten 
years at Delagoa Bay, the scheme having to be abandoned for 
want of funds. On his return to the Transvaal in 1876 Burgers 
found that the conditions of affairs in the state was worse than 
ever. The acting-president had in his absence been granted 
leave by the volksraad to carry out various measures opposed 
to the public welfare; native lands had been indiscriminately 
allotted to adventurers, and a war with Sikukuni (Secocoeni), 
a native chief on the eastern borders of the country, was 
imminent. A commando was called out, which the president 
himself led. The expedition was an ignominious failure, and 
many burghers did not hesitate to assign their non-success to 
the fact that Burgers's views on religious questions were not 
sound. Burgers then proceeded to levy taxes, which were never 
paid; to enrol troops, which never marched; and to continue 
the head of a government which had neither resources, credit 
nor power of administration. In 1877 the Transvaal one-pound 
notes were valued at one shilling cash. Add to this condition 
of things the fact that the Zulus were threatening the Transvaal 
on its southern border, and the picture of utter collapse which 
existed in the state is complete. 

B. First Annexation by Great Britain. — This condition of 
affairs coincided with the second movement in South Africa for 
a confederation of its various colonies and states, a movement 
of which the then colonial secretary, the 4th earl of Carnarvon, 
was a warm advocate. As to the Transvaal in particular, 



it was felt by Lord Carnarvon " that the safety and prosperity 
of the republic v/ould be best assured by its union with the 
British colonies." Sir Theophilus Shepstone (q.v.) was given a 
commission, dated the 5th of October, 1876, instructing him to 
visit the Transvaal and empowering him, if it was desired by 
the inhabitants and in his judgment necessary, to annex the 
country to the British crown. Sir Theophilus went to Pretoria 
in January 1877, with an escort of twenty-five mounted police, 
and entered into conferences with the president and executive as 
to the state of the country. By this time Burgers was no longer 
blinded by the foolish optimism of a visionary who had wovei\ 
finespun theories of what an ideal republic might be. He 
had lived among the Boers and attempted to lead their govern- 
ment. He had found their idea of liberty to be anarchy, their 
native policy to be slavery, and their republic to be a sham. His 
was a bitter awakening, and the bitterness of it found expres- 
sion in some remarkable words addressed to the volksraad: 

"I would rather," said Burgers in March 1877, " be a policeman 
under a strong government than the president of such a state. It is 
you — you members of the Raad and the Boers — who have lost the 
country, who have sold your independence for a drink. You have 
ill-treated the natives, you have shot them down, you have sold 
them into slavery, and now you have to pay the penalty. . . . We 
should delude ourselves by entertaining the hope that matters 
would mend by-and-by. . . . Do you know what recently happened 
in Turkey? Because no civilized government was carried on 
there, the Great Powers interfered and said, * Thus far and no 
farther.' And if this is done to an empire, will s. little republic 
be excused when it misbehaves? . . _ If we want justice, we must 
be in a position to ask it with unsullied hands. ..." 

After careful investigation Shepstone satisfied himself that 
annexation was the only possible salvation for the Transvaal. 
He had gone to Pretoria hoping that the Transvaal volksraad 
would accept Carnarvon's federation scheme; but the federation 
proposals were rejected by the raad. Shepstone was willing 
to find some way other than simple annexation out of the diffi- 
culty, but none appeared to present itself. The treasury was 
empty, the Boers refused to pay their taxes, and there was no 
power to enforce them. A public debt of £215,000 existed, and 
government contractors were left unpaid. Sir Theophilus 
Shepstone, finding that the raad would not adopt any remedial 
measures, on the 12th of April 1877 issued a proclamation annex- 
ing the country. The proclamation stated (among other things) : 
" It is the wish of Her Most Gracious Majesty that it [the state] 
shall enjoy the fullest legislative privileges compatible with 
the circumstances of the country and the intelligence of its 
people." The wisdom of the step taken by Shep- BriWsA 
stone has been called in question. For many years Annexation, 
subsequently the matter was so surrounded with 7577 * 
the sophistry of English party politics that it was difficult 
for Englishmen to form any impartial opinion. The history 
of the Transvaal is more complete and better understood to-day 
than it was in 1877, and no one who acquaints himself with the 
facts will deny that Shepstone acted with care and moderation. 
The best evidence in favour of the step is to be found in the 
publicly expressed views of the state's own president, Burgers, 
already quoted. Moreover, the menace of attack on the Zulu 
side was a serious one, however able the Boers may have been 
to meet a foe who fought in the open, and who had been beaten 
by them in previous wars. Even before annexation had occurred, 
Shepstone felt the danger so acutely that he sent a message to 
Cetywayo, the Zulu chief, warning him that British annexation 
was about to be proclaimed and that invasion of the Transvaal 
would not be tolerated. To this warning Cetywayo, who, 
encouraged by the defeat of the Boers at Sikukuni's hands, 
had already gathered his warriors together, replied: "I thank 
my father Somtseu [Shepstone] for his message. I am glad that 
he has sent it, because the Dutch have tired me out, and I 
intended to fight with them . . . and to drive them over 
the Vaal. ..." A still further reason for Shepstone's 
annexation, given by Sir Bartle Frere, was that Burgers had 
already sought alliance with European powers, and Shepstone 
had no reason to doubt that if Great Britain refused to interfere, 
Germany would intervene. Moreover, apart from the attitude 



FIRST ANNEXATION! 



TRANSVAAL

of President Burgers,, which cannot be said to have been one of 
active opposition, a considerable number of the Boers accepted 
the annexation with complacency. Burgers himself left the 
Transvaal a disappointed, heart-broken man, and a deathbed 
statement published some time after his decease throws a lurid 
light on the intrigues which arose before and after annexation. 
He shows how, for purely personal ends, Kruger allied himself' 
with the British faction who were agitating for annexation, and 
to undermine him and endeavour to gain the presidency, urged 
the Boers to pay no taxes. However this may be, Burgers was 
crushed; but as a consequence the British government and not 
Paul Kruger was, for a time at least, master of the Transvaal. 
In view of his attitude before annexation, it was not surprising 
that Kruger should be one of the first men to agitate against 
it afterwards. The work of destruction had gone too far. The 
plot had miscarried. And so Kruger and Dr Jorissen, by whom 
he was accompanied, were the first to approach Lord Carnarvon 
with an appeal for revocation of the proclamation. Lord 
Carnarvon's reply was that the act of annexation was an irrevo- 
cable one. Unfortunately the train of events in England 
favoured the intrigues of the party who wished the annexation 
cancelled. In 1878 Lord Carnarvon resigned, and there were 
other evidences of dissension in the British cabinet. 

Kruger, who since the annexation had held a salaried 
appointment under the British Government, again became one 
of a deputation to England. His colleague was Piet Joubert. 
They laid their case before Sir Michael Hicks Beach (who 
had succeeded Lord Carnarvon) but met with no success. Sir 
Michael, however, in a despatch dated September the 16th 
1878, reiterated the intention of the British cabinet to grant the 
state " to the utmost practicable extent, its individuality and 
powers of self-government under the sovereignty of the queen." 
On the occasion of Kruger's second mission to endeavour to get 
the annexation revoked Sir T. Shepstone determined to dispense 
with his further services as a government servant, and terminated 
the engagement. In the beginning of 1879 Shepstone was 
recalled and Colonel Owen Lanyon, who had served in Bechuana- 
land and was then administrator of Griqualand West, was 
appointed administrator in the Transvaal. In the meantime, 
the Zulu forces which threatened the Transvaal had been turned 
against the British, and the disaster of Isaridhlwana occurred. 
Rumours of British defeat soon reached the Transvaal, and 
Agitation encouraged the disaffected party to become bolder 
for inde- in their agitation against British rule. Thus Sir 
pendence. Bartle Frere wrote at the time: "All accounts 
from Pretoria represent that the great body of the Boer 
population is still under the belief that the Zulus are more 
than a match for us, that our difficulties are more than we can 
surmount, and that the present is the favourable opportunity 
for demanding their independence." In April Frere visited 
Pretoria and conferred with the Boers. He assured them that 
they might look forward to complete self-government under the 
Crown, and at the same time urged them to sink political 
differences and join hands with the British against their com- 
mon enemy, the Zulus. The Boers, however, continued to 
agitate for complete independence, and, with the honourable 
exception of Piet Uys, a gallant Boer leader, and a small band of 
followers, who assisted Colonel Evelyn Wood at Hlobani, the 
Boers held entirely aloof from the conflict with the Zulus, a 
campaign which cost Great Britain many lives and £5,000,000 
before the Zulu power was finally broken. In June Sir Garnet 
Wolseley went to South Africa as commander of the forces 
against the Zulus, and as high commissioner " for a time," in 
the place of Sir Bartle Frere, of the Transvaal and Natal. 
Meantime Frere's proposals to fulfil the promises made to grant 
the Boers a liberal constitution were shelved. After the " settle- 
ment " of the Zulu question, Sir Garnet Wolseley proceeded 
to Pretoria and immediately organized an expedition against 
Sikukuni, who throughout the Zulu campaign had been acting 
under the advice of Cetywayo. Sikukuni's stronghold was 
captured and his forces disbanded. 

Sir Garnet Wolseley now assured the Boers at a public gathering 



that so long as the sun shone the British flag would fly at Pretoria. 
In May 1880 he returned to England, having established in the 
Transvaal a legislative council with powers so limited as to con- 
vince many of the Boers that there was no intention of fulfilling 
Shepstone's promises. Meanwhile events in Great Britain had 
once more taken a turn which gave encouragement to the dis- 
affected Boers. Already in November 1879 Gladstone had 
conducted his Midlothian campaign. In one speech, referring 
to Cyprus and the Transvaal, he said: " If those acquisitions 
were as valuable as they are valueless, I would repudiate 
them, -because they were obtained by means dishonourable 
to the character of our country." And in another speech he 
said that the British had insanely placed themselves Effect of Mr 
in the strange predicament of the free subjects of a Gladstone's 
monarchy going to coerce the free subjects of a speeches in 
republic. Expressions such as these were trans- Gngaad * 
lated into Dutch and distributed among the Boers, and they 
exercised a good deal of influence in fanning the agitation already 
going on in the Transvaal. So keenly were the Midlothian 
speeches appreciated by the Boers that the Boer -committee 
wrote a letter of thanks to Gladstone, and expressed the hope that 
should a change in the government of Great Britain occur, 
" the injustice done to the Transvaal might find redress." In 
April 1880, this change in the British Government did occur. 
Gladstone became prime minister, and shortly afterwards 
Frere was recalled. Could events be more auspicious for the 
party seeking retrocession? On being directly appealed to 
by Kruger and Joubert, Gladstone however replied that the 
liberty which they sought might be " most easily and promptly 
conceded to the Transvaal as a member of a South African 
Confederation." This was not at all what was wanted, and the 
agitation continued. Meanwhile in the Transvaal, concurrently 
with the change of prime minister and high commissioner, the 
administrator, Colonel Lanyon, began vigorously to enforce 
taxation among the Boers. Men who would not pay taxes to 
their own appointed governments, and who were daily expecting 
to be allowed to return to that condition of anarchy which 
they had come to regard as the normal order of things, were not 
likely to respond willingly to the tax-gatherer's demands. That 
many of them refused payment in the circumstances which 
existed was natural. 

In November matters were brought to a head by .the wagons 
of a farmer named Bezuidenhout being seized in respect of the 
non-payment of taxes, and promptly retaken from 
the sheriff by a party of Boers. Lanyon began to War i88 £ 
recognize that the position was becoming grave, and 
telegraphed to Sir George Colley, the high commissioner of 
South-East Africa, for military aid. This, however, was not 
immediately available, and on the 13th of December the 
Boers in public meeting at Paardekraal resolved once 
more to proclaim the South African Republic, and in the 
meantime to appoint a triumvirate, consisting of Kruger, 
Pretorius and Joubert, as a provisional government. Within 
three days of the Paardekraal meeting a letter was sent to the 
administrator demanding the keys of the government offices. 
Formal proclamation of the repuhlic was made on the 16th of 
December (Dingaan's Day) at Heidelberg. Hostilities forthwith 
began. Meanwhile pressure was put on the British prime 
minister to carry out the policy he had avowed while out of 
office. But it was not until Great Britain was suffering from the 
humiliation of defeat that he was convinced that the time for 
granting that retrocession had arrived. The first shots fired were 
outside Potchefstroom, which was then occupied by a small 
British garrison (see Potchefstroom). On the 20th of December 
some 240 men under Colonel Anstruther, chiefly belonging to 
the 94th Regiment, while marching from Lydenburg to Pretoria, 
were surprised at Bronkhorst Spruit, and cut up by the Boer 
forces. Half the men were killed and wounded; the other half 
including some officers, were taken prisoners. Captain Elliot, 
one of the prisoners, who had been released on parole, was shot 
dead by Boers while crossing the Vaal, and Captain Lambert, 
another paroled prisoner who accompanied Elliot, was also shot,

[FIRST ANNEXATION 



but escaped. Pretoria, Rustenberg, Lydenburg, and other smaller 
towns bad been placed in a position of defence under the direc- 
tions of Colonel Bellairs, who remained in command at Pretoria, 
the garrison consisting of a small number of troops and the loyal 
inhabitants. Sir George Colley, with about 1400 men, marched 
towards the Transvaal frontier, but before reaching it he found, 
on the 24th of January 1881, that the Boers had already invaded 
Natal and occupied Laing's Nek. He pitched his camp at 
Ingogo. Having been defeated at Laing's Nek, and suffered 
considerable loss in an engagement near Ingogo, 
mnitsu Colley took a force to the top of Majuba, a mountain 
overlooking the Boer camp and the nek. He went 
up during the night, and in the morning was attacked and 
overwhelmed by the Boers (Feb. 27). Of the 554 men who 
constituted the British force on Majuba, 92 were killed and 
134 wounded, Sir George Colley himself being amongst those 
who were slain. 

Ten days previous to the disaster at Majuba Sir Evelyn Wood 
had arrived at Newcastle with reinforcements. On Colley's 
death he assumed command. Negotiations had been opened 
with the Boers before the attack on Majuba and the British 
cabinet refused to allow that disaster to influence their action. 
On the 6th of March a truce was concluded and on the 21st terms 
of peace were arranged between the Boer triumvirate and Sir 
Evelyn Wood. The most important of these terms were that 
the Transvaal should have complete internal self-government 
under British suzerainty and that a British resident should be 
stationed at Pretoria. Another article reserved to her majesty 
" the control of the external relations of the said state, including 
the conclusion of treaties and the conduct of diplomatic inter- 
course with foreign powers," and the right to march troops 
through the Transvaal. The boundaries of the state were 
defined, and to them the Transvaal was strictly to adhere. 
These terms practically conceded all that the Boers demanded, 
and were never regarded as anything else than surrender either 
by the Boers or the loyalists in South Africa. The agreement 
had hardly been concluded when Sir Frederick Roberts arrived 
at the Cape with 10,000 troops, and after spending forty-eight 
hours there returned to England. 

In the meantime, while the British general was making a 
treaty under the instructions of British ministers on the frontier, 
the beleaguered garrisons of Pretoria, Potchefstroom, and other 
smaller towns were gallantly holding their own. The news of 
the surrender reached Pretoria through Boer sources, and when 
first received there was laughed at by the garrison and inhabi- 
tants as a Boer joke. When the bitter truth was at length 
realized, the British flag was dragged through the dust of Pretoria 
streets by outraged Englishmen. Presently there assembled in 
Pretoria a commission to elaborate the terms of peace. On 
the one side were the Boer triumvirate, on the other Sir Evelyn 
Wood, Sir Hercules Robinson (Frere's successor in the high com- 
missionership), and Sir J. H. de Villiers, chief justice of Cape 
Colony, while President Brand of the Orange Free State gave the 
commission the benefit of his advice. The terms agreed upon 
were drawn up in the form of a convention and signed (Aug. 3). 
The preamble to the Pretoria Convention of 1881 
^onveaUon. contained in brief but explicit terms the grant of 
* self-government to the Boers, subject to British 
suzerainty. In later years, when the Boers desired to regard 
the whole of this convention (and not merely the articles) as 
cancelled by the London Convention of 1884, and with it the 
suzerainty, which wa3 only mentioned in the preamble, Mr 
Chamberlain, a member of the cabinet of 1880-1885, pointed 
out that if the preamble to this instrument were considered 
cancelled, so also would be the grant of self-government. 

The government of the state was handed over to the 
triumvirate on the 8th of August and was continued in their 
name until May 1883, when Kruger was elected president. 

C From the Retrocession to i8gg. — The retrocession of the 
Transvaal was a terrible blow to the loyalists. The Boers, 
on the other hand, found themselves in better plight than 
they had ever been before. Their native foes had been 



crushed by British forces; their liabilities were consolidated 
into a debt to Great Britain, to be repaid at convenience 
and leisure — as a matter of fact, not even interest was paid 
for some time. If ever a small state was well treated by a 
large one, the Transvaal was so in the retrocession of 1881. 
Unfortunately, this magnanimity was forthcoming after 
defeat It appeared as though a virtue had been made of 
a necessity, and the Boers never regarded it in any other 
light. 

The new volksraad had scarcely been returned and the 
Pretoria Convention ratified (Oct. 25) before a system of 
government concessions to private individuals 
was started. These concessions, in so far as they r^%^ 
prejudiced the commerce and general interests 
of the inhabitants, consisted chiefly in the granting of mono- 
polies. Among the first monopolies which were granted in 1882 
was one for the manufacture of spirituous liquor. The system 
continued steadily down to 1899, by which time railways, 
dynamite, spirits, iron, sugar, wool, bricks, jam, paper and 
a number of other things were all of them articles of monopoly. 
In 1882 also began that alteration of the franchise law which 
subsequently developed into , positive exclusion of practically 
all save the original Boer burghers of the country from the 
franchise. In 1881, on the retrocession, full franchise rights 
could be obtained after two years' residence; in 1882 the period 
of residence was increased to five years. Meanwhile the land- 
hunger of the Boers became stimulated rather than checked 
by the regaining of the independence of their country. On 
the western border, where the natives were of less warlike 
character than those on their southern and northern frontiers, 
intrigues were already going on with petty tribal chiefs, and 
the Boers drove out a portion of the Barolongs from their lands, 
setting up the so-called republics of Stellaland and Goshen. 
This act called forth a protest from the 15th Lord Derby 
(now secretary of state for the colonics), stating that he could 
not recognize the right of Boer freebooters to set up govern- 
ments of their own on the Transvaal borders. This protest 
had no effect upon the freebooters, who issued one proclamation 
after another, until in November 1883 they united the two 
new republics under the title of the " United States of Stella- 
land." Simultaneously with this " irresponsible " movement 
for expansion, President Kruger proceeded to London to 
interview Lord Derby and endeavour to induce him to dis- 
pense with the suzerainty, and to withdraw other clauses in 
the Pretoria Convention on foreign relations and natives, which 
were objectionable from the Boer point of view. Moreover, 
Kruger requested that the term " South African Republic " 
should be substituted for Transvaal State. 

The result was the London Convention of the 27th of Feb- 
ruary 1884. In this document a fresh set of articles was 
substituted for those of the Pretoria Convention of 1881. In 
the articles of the new convention the boundaries were once 
more defined, concessions being made to the Transvaal on the 
Bechuanaland frontier, and to them the republic was bound 
to " strictly adhere." In what followed it must always be 
remembered that Lord Derby began by emphatically rejecting 
the first Boer draft of a treaty on the ground that London 
no treaty was possible except between equal sove- Conven* 
reign states. Moreover, it is undeniable that Lord tioa ' 1884 - 
Derby acted as though he was anxious to appear to be 
giving the Boers what they wanted. He would not formally 
abolish the suzerainty, but he was willing not to mention 
it; and though, in substituting new articles for those of the 
Pretoria Convention he left the preamble untouched, he 
avoided anything which could commit the Boer delegates 
to a formal recognition of that fact. On the other hand, 
he was most indignant when in the House of Lords he was 
accused by Lord Caims of impairing British interests and 
relinquishing the queen's suzerainty. He declared that he 
had preserved the thing in its substance, if he had not actually 
used the word; and this view of the matter was always officially 
maintained in the colonial office (which, significantly enough, 



FIRST ANNEXATION] 



TRANSVAAL

dealt with Transvaal affairs) whatever the political party in 
power. Unfortunately, the timid way in which it was done 
made as ineffaceable an impression on Kruger even as the 
surrender after Majuba. Article 4 stated : 

" The South African Republic will conclude no treaty or engage- 
ment with any state or nation, other than the Orange Free State, 
nor with any native tribe to the eastward or westward of the 
Republic, until the same has been approved by her Majesty the 
Queen." 

The other article to which the greatest interest was subse- 
quently attached was art. 14: 

" All persons, other than natives, conforming themselves to the 
laws of the South African Republic (a) will have full liberty, with 
their families, to enter, travel, or reside in any part of the South 
African Republic; (b) they will be entitled to hire or possess houses, 
manufactories, warehouses, shops and premises; (c) they may carry 
on their commerce either in person or by any agents whom they 
may think fit to employ; (d) they will not be subject, in respect 
of their persons or property, or in respect of their commerce or 
industry, to any taxes, whether general or local, other than those 
which are or may be imposed upon citizens of the said Republic." 

Notwithstanding the precise fixing of the boundaries of 
the republic by the London Convention, President Kruger 
Territorial endeavoured to maintain the Boer hold on Goshen 
Expansion and " Stellaland, but the British government on 
Efforts. this point proved firm, and an expedition set out 
in 1884 under Sir Charles Warren, broke up the freebooters' two 
states, and occupied the country without a shot being fired 
(see Bechuanaland). The expedition cost Great Britain a 
million and a half, but the attempt at farther extension west- 
wards was foiled, and a little later treaties with Lobenguela 
and the grant to Cecil Rhodes r and his co-directors of a 
charter for the British South Africa Company put a check 
on designs the Boers held to expand northward (see Rhodesia). 
On the eastern border a similar policy of expansion was followed 
by the Boers, and in this instance with more success. Follow- 
ing up the downfall of the Zulu power after the British conquest 
in 1879, several parties of Boers began intriguing with the petty 
chiefs, and in May 1884, in the presence of 10,000 Zulus, they 
proclaimed Dinizulu, the son of Cetywayo, to be king of Zulu- 
land (see Zululand). As a " reward " for their services to the 
Zulus, the Boers then took over from them a tract of country in 
which they established a " New Republic." .In 1886 the 
" New Republic " with limits considerably narrowed, was 
recognised by Great Britain, and the territory became incor- 
porated with the Transvaal in 1888. Their eastern boundary, 
in the teeth of the spirit of the conventions, and with but scant 
observance of the letter, was by this means considerably 
extended. A similar policy eventually brought Swaziland 
almost entirely under their dominion (see Swaziland). At the 
same time President Kruger revived the project of obtaining a 
seaport for the state, one of the objects of Boer ambitions since 
i860 (vide supra), Kruger endeavoured to acquire Kosi Bay, 
to the north of Zululand and only 50 m. east of the Swazi 
frontier. Meanwhile, events occurring within the state augured 
ill for the future of the country. In 1884 a concession to a 
number of Hollander and German capitalists of all rights to 
make railways led to the formation of the Netherlands Rail- 
way Company. This company, which was not actually floated 
Economic till 1887, was destined to exercise a disastrous in- 
Deveiop- fiuence upon the fortunes of the state. Gold 
meats: Gold digging ( had hitherto enjoyed in the Transvaal but 
us ry, a p recar j ous existence. In 1883 the discovery of 
Hoodie's Reef near the Kaap Valley led to a considerable influx 
of diggers and prospectors from the colonies and Europe, and 
by 1884 the Sheba Mine had been opened up, and Barberton, 
with a population of 5000 inhabitants, sprung into existence. 
In 1886 the Rand goldfields, which had just been discovered, 
were proclaimed and Johannesburg was founded. From 
that time the gold industry made steady progress until the 
Rand gold mines proved the richest and most productive 
goldfield in the world. As the industry prospered, so did the 
European population increase. The revenue of the state went 
up by leaps and bounds. At the end of 1886 Johannesburg 



consisted of a few stores and some few thousand inhabitants. 
In October 1896 the sanitary board census estimated the popula- 
tion as 107,078, of whom 50,907 were Europeans. The wealth 
which was pouring into the Boer state coffers exceeded the wildest 
dreams of President Kruger and his followers. Land went up 
in value, and farms, many of them at comparatively remote 
distances from the goldfields, were sold at enormously enhanced 
prices. In fact, so attractive did this sale of land become 
to the Boers that they eventually parted with a third of the 
whole land area of the country to Uitlander purchasers. Yet 
in spite of the wealth which the industry of the Uitlanders 
was creating, a policy of rigid political exclusion and restriction 
was adopted towards them. 

An attempt was made in 1888, after the conference fteld 
between Cape Colony, the Orange Free State and Natal, to 
induce the Transvaal to enter a customs union. % e i a t? 0tts 
Kruger would have none of it, although by so doing with the rest 
he could have obtained permission for a settlement of South 
at and railway to Kosi Bay. A convention to this Afrka * 
effect was signed in August 1890, the Transvaal being allowed 
three years in which to take advantage of its provisions. 
Kruger's design at this time was to bring the whole of the 
external trade of the state, which was growing yearly as the gold 
industry developed, through Delagoa Bay and over the Nether- 
lands railway. His hostility towards Great Britain and even 
Cape Colony led him to adopt a commercial policy both narrow 
and prejudicial to the interests of the gold industry. In the 
appointment of F. W. Reitz as president of the Orange Free 
State (January 1889) on the death of Sir John Brand, Kruger 
recognized a new opportunity of endeavouring to cajole the 
Free State. Brand had arranged, in the teeth of the strongest 
protests from Kruger, that the Cape railway should extend 
to Bloemfontein and subsequently to the Vaal river. Kruger 
now endeavoured to control the railway policy of the Free 
State, and induced that republic to agree to a treaty whereby 
each state bound itself to help the other whenever the inde- 
pendence of either should be threatened or assailed, unless 
the cause of quarrel was, in the eyes of the state called in to 
assist, an unjust one (see Orange Free State). 

In 1890 a feeling of considerable irritation bad grown up 
among the Uitlanders at the various monopolies, but par- 
ticularly at the dynamite monopoly, which pressed _„

solely and with peculiar seventy upon gold miners. ^ es/riW/011s- 
Requests for consideration in the matter of the 
franchise, and also for a more liberal commercial policy in 
the matter of railways, dynamite and customs dues, began 
to be made. In response Kruger enacted that the period 
of qualification for the full franchise should now be raised 
to ten years instead of five. He at the same time instituted 
what was called a second chamber, the franchise qualifications 
for which were easier, but which was not endowed with any 
real power. During this year Kruger visited Johannesburg, 
and what was known as " the flag incident " occurred. He 
had by this time rendered himself somewhat unpopular, and 
in the evening the Transvaal flag, which flew over the land- 
drost's house, was pulled down. This incensed Kruger so 
much that for many years he continued to quote it as a reason 
why no consideration could be granted to the Uitlanders. 

By 1892 the Uitlanders began to feel that if they were to 
obtain any redress for their grievances combined constitutional 
action was called for, and the first reform move- 
ment began. The Transvaal National Union was advances. 
formed. This consisted at the outset chiefly of 
mercantile and professional men and artisans. The mining men, 
especially the heads of the larger houses, did not care at this 
juncture to run the risk of political agitation. The Hon. J. 
Tudhope, an ex-minister in the Cape government, was elected 
chairman of the union. The objects of this body were avowed 
from the outset. They desired equal rights for all citizens, the 
abolition of monopolies and abuses, together with the maintenance 
of the state's independence. In the furthering of this policy 
Tudhope was supported by Charles Leonard and his brother

[RETROCESSION TO 1899 



James Leonard, at one time attorney-general of Cape Colony. 
Both the Leonards, as well as many of their .followers, were 
South Africans by birth. They, in common with the great 
bulk of the Uitlanders, recognized that the state had every 
right to have its independence respected. But they asserted 
that a narrow and retrogressive policy, such as Kruger was 
following, was the very thing to endanger that independence. 
The soundness of these views and the legitimacy of Uitlander 
aspirations were recognized by a few Boer officials at Pretoria. 
Some prominent burghers even spoke at Uitlander meetings 
in favour of the Uitlander requests. At a later date, Chief 
Justice Kotze, when on circuit, warned the Boers that in its 
retrogressive action the government was undermining the 
grondwet or constitution of the state. It soon became evident 
that one course, and one only, lay open to President Kruger if 
he desired to avert a catastrophe. It was to meet in a friendly 
spirit those men who had by their industry converted a poor 
pastoral country into a rich industrial one, who represented 
more than half the inhabitants, who paid more than three- 
fourths of the revenue, and who were anxious to join him as 
citizens, with the rights of citizenship. He chose a course 
diametrically opposite. In an interview accorded to seven 
delegates from the National Union, in 1892, he told Charles 
Leonard to "go back and tell your people that I shall never 
give them anything. I shall never change my policy. And 
now let the storm burst." In 1894 there occurred an incident 
which not only incensed the Uitlanders to fury, but called for 
British intervention. A number of British subjects resident in 
Coalman- the Transvaal, in spite of their having no political 
deeringin* status, were commandeered to suppress a native 
cldent,t894. rising. This led to a protest, and eventually a visit 
to Pretoria, from Sir Henry Loch the high commissioner. 
In the negotiations which followed, President Kruger at 
length agreed to extend " most favoured nation " privileges to 
British subjects in reference to compulsory military service, 
and five British subjects who had been sent as prisoners 
to the front were released. This result was not, however, 
achieved before President Kruger had done his utmost to 
induce Sir Henry Loch to promise some revision in favour 
of the Transvaal of the London Convention. Following this 
incident came a further alteration in the franchise law, making 
the franchise practically impossible to obtain. At a banquet 
given in honour of the German emperor's birthday in Pretoria 
in January 1895, Kruger referred in glowing terms to the 
friendship of Germany for the Transvaal, which in the future 
was to be more firmly established than ever. This speech was 
public evidence of what was known to be going on behind 

the scenes. The German consul at Pretoria at this 
Flirtation J unc ture as a volatile, sanguine man, with 

visionary ideas of the important part Germany was 
to play in the future as the patron and ally of the South African 
Republic, and of the extent to which the Bismarckian policy 
might go in abetting an anti-British campaign. Whether he 
deceived himself or not, he led President Kruger and the Boers to 
believe that Germany was prepared to go to almost any length in 
support of the Transvaal if any opportunity occurred. His in- 
fluence was an undoubted factor in the Kruger policy of that time. 
The Delagoa Bay railway being at length completed to Pretoria 
and Johannesburg, Kruger determined to take steps to bring 

the Rand traffic over it. The Netherlands railway 
incident. De S an DV putting a prohibitive tariff on goods from 

the Vaal river. Not to be coerced in this manner, 
the Rand merchants proceeded to bring their goods on from 
the Vaal by wagon. Kruger then closed the drifts (or fords) 
on the river by which the wagons crossed. He only reopened 
them after the receipt of what was tantamount to an ultimatum 
on the subject from Great Britain. 

In May 1895, on the urgent representations of Sir Henry Loch, 
the British government annexed Tongaland, including Kosi Bay, 
thus making the British and Portuguese boundaries contermi- 
nous on the coast of south-east Africa. In the previous month 
certain native territories between Tongaland and Swaziland had 



been annexed by Great Britain. The Boers, who had failed 
to fulfil the conditions under which they might have secured 
Kosi Bay, nevertheless resented this action, which Boer Road 
took away from them all chance of obtaining a to the Sea 
seaport. Kruger telegraphed that " this annexation B/ocfcetf < 
cannot be regarded by this government otherwise than as 
directed against this republic. They must therefore regard it as 
an unfriendly act, against which they hereby protest." The 
protest was unheeded, the British government having realized 
the international complications that might ensue had the 
Transvaal a port of its own. 

At this time the Uitlanders formed a majority of the popula- 
tion, owned half the land and nine-tenths of the property, 
and they were at least entitled to a hearing. When uitlander 
in August 1895 they forwarded one of their many /?e/orm 
petitions praying for redress of their grievances Movement, 
and an extension of the franchise, their petition, with over 
35,000 signatures, was rejected with jeers and insult. One 
member of the Raad, during a debate in the chamber, called 
upon the Uitlanders to " come on and fight " for their rights 
if they wanted them. The words were but the utterance of 
an individual Raad member, but they were only a shade less 
offensive than those used by Kruger in 1892, and they too 
accurately describe the attitude of the Boer executive. In 
September a meeting of the chambers of mines and commerce 
was held at Johannesburg, and a letter on various matters of 
the greatest importance to the mining industry was addressed 
to the Boer executive. It was never vouchsafed an answer. 
What the next step should be was freely discussed. Some 
urged an appeal to the Imperial government; but others, 
especially men of colonial birth and experience, objected 
that they would be leaning on a broken reed. That men 
who had still the memory of Majuba in their hearts should 
have felt misgiving is not to be wondered at. At this juncture* 
(October 1895) came overtures to the leading Uitlanders 
from Cecil Rhodes, then prime minister of Cape Colony, 
and from Dr Jameson, leading to the Jameson Raid. To one 
or two men this scheme, subsequently known as The 
the Jameson Plan, had been revealed in the pre- "Jameson 
vious June, but to the majority even of the small Pian *" 
group of leaders it was not known till October or November 
1895. The proposition came in a tempting hour. Rhodes and 
Jameson, after considerable deliberation, came to the conclu- 
sion that they might advantageously intervene between Kruger 
and the Uitlanders. They induced Alfred Beit, who was 
an old personal friend of Rhodes, and also largely interested 
in the Rand gold mines, to lend his co-operation. They then 
submitted their scheme to some of the Uitlander leaders. Be- 
tween them it was arranged that Jameson should gather a 
force of 800 men on the Transvaal border; that the Uit- 
landers should continue their agitation; and that, should 
no satisfactory concession be obtained from Kruger, a com- 
bined movement of armed forces should be made against the 
government. The arsenal at Pretoria was to be seized; the 
Uitlanders in Johannesburg were to rise and hold the town. 
Jameson was to make a rapid march to Johannesburg. Mean- 
while, in order to give Kruger a final chance of making concessions 
with a good grace, and for the purpose of stating the Uitlander 
case to the world, Charles Leonard, as chairman of the 
National Union, issued a historic manifesto, which concluded 
as follows: — 

We have now only two questions to consider: (a) What do we 
want? (b) How shall we get it? I have stated plainly what our 
grievances are, and I shall answer with equal directness the question, 
What do we want? We want: (1) the establishment of this republic 
as a true republic; (2) a grondwet or constitution which shall be 
framed by competent persons selected by representatives of the whole 
people and framed on lines laid down by them — a constitution which 
shall be safeguarded against hasty alteration; (3) an equitable 
franchise law, and fair representation; (4) equality of the Dutch 
and English languages; (5; responsibility to the heads of the great 
departments of the legislature; (6) removal of religious disabilities; 
(7) independence of the courts of justice, with adequate and secured 
remuneration of the judges; (8) liberal and comprehensive education ; t

(q) efficient civil service, with adequate provision for pay and pension; 
(10) free trade in South African products. That is what we want. 
There now remains the question which is to be put before you 
at the meeting of the 6th of January, viz. How shall we get it? 
To this question I shall expect from you an answer in plain terms 
according to your deliberate judgment. 

The Jameson conspiracy fared no worse and no better than 
the great majority of conspiracies in history. It failed in its 
immediate object. Jameson did not obtain more than 500 men. 
Johannesburg had the greatest difficulty in smuggling in and 
distributing the rifles with which the insurgents were to be armed. 
The scheme to seize the Pretoria fort had to be abandoned, 
as at the time fixed Pretoria was thronged with Boers. Finally, 
to make confusion worse confounded, Jameson, becoming 
impatient of delay, in spite of receiving direct messages from 
the leaders at Johannesburg telling him on no account to 
move, marched into the Transvaal. 

The policy of delay in the execution of the plot which the 
Uitlander leaders found themselves compelled to adopt was 
determined by a variety of causes. Apart from the difficulty 
of obtaining arms, a serious question arose at the eleventh 
hour which filled some of the Uitlanders with mistrust. The 
reform leaders in the Transvaal, down to and including the 
Johannesburg rising, had always recognized as a cardinal 
principle the maintenance of the independence of the state. 
From Cape Town it was now hinted that the movement in 
which Jameson was to co-operate should, in Rhodes's view, be 
carried out under the British flag. A meeting of Uitlander 
leaders was hastily summoned on the 25th of December. Two 
messengers were that, night despatched to interview Rhodes, 
who then gave the assurance that the flag question might be 
left to a plebiscite of the inhabitants of the Transvaal 1 (see 
Blue-book, 1897, 165, p. 21). It was determined nevertheless 
to postpone action; however, on the 29th of December, Jameson 
started, and the news of his having done so reached Johannes- 
burg from outside sources. A number of leading citizens were 
at once formed into a reform committee. In the absence of 
Collapse of Charles Leonard, who had been sent as one of the 
Jameson delegates to Cape Town to interview Rhodes, 
Raid. Lionel Phillips, a partner in Messrs Eckstein & Co., 

the largest mining firm on the Rand, was elected chairman. 
Phillips had been for three years in succession chairman of the 
chamber of mines, and he had persistently for several years 
tried to induce Kruger to take a reasonable view of the require- 
ments of the industry. Under the supervision of the reform 
committee, such arms as had been smuggled in were distributed, 
and Colonel Frank Rhodes was given charge of the armed men. 
A large body of police was enrolled, and order was maintained 
throughout the town. On the 2nd of January 1896 Jameson, 
who found himself at Doornkop in a position surrounded by 
Boers, surrendered. Jameson and his men were conveyed to 
Pretoria as prisoners, and subsequently handed over to the 
high commissioner (Sir Hercules Robinson, who had succeeded 
Sir Henry Loch in June 1895). 

Significant of the attitude of Germany — whose "flirtation" 
with the Transvaal has been noted — was an open telegram sent 
by the emperor William II. the day after the surrender of 
Jameson congratulating Kruger that " without 
Telegram, appealing to the help of friendly powers" he had 
repelled the raiders. The British government rejoined 
by commissioning a flying squadron and by calling attention 
to the London Convention, reserving the supervision of the 
foreign relations of the Transvaal to Great Britain. In Johannes- 
Jameson, speaking at Durban on the 9th of August 19 10, 
declared that the raid was not racial in the sense usually understood, 
but an effort towards federation. During the raid he carried a 
letter containing the names of the proposed new executive, and had 
the raid succeeded it was proposed to make General Lukas Meyer 
(d. 1902) president. Jameson subsequently explained that Rhodes 
and he in designating " an eminent Dutchman " as president of 
11 the new provincial republic " had had no communication with 
Meyer on the subject. Neither he (Jameson) nor Rhodes had any 
knowledge of a proposal, to which General Botha had publicly 
referred, that Charles Leonard should be president. (See the Cape 
Times Weekly Edition, Sept. 7, 1910, p. 15.) 



burg meanwhile the Kruger government regained control. 
The whole of the reform committee (with the exception of a 
few who fled the country) were arrested on a charge of high 
treason and imprisoned in Pretoria. In April, at the trial, the 
four leaders — Lionel Phillips, Frank Rhodes, J. H. Hammond 
and George Farrar, who in conjunction with Charles Leonard 
had made the arrangements with Jameson — were sentenced 
to death, the sentence being after some months' imprisonment 
commuted to a fine of £25,000 each. The rest of the committee 
were each sentenced to two years' imprisonment, £2000 fine 
or another year's imprisonment, and three years' banishment. 
This sentence, after a month's incarceration, was also com- 
muted. The fine was exacted, and the prisoners, with the 
exception of Woolls Sampson and W. D. (Karri) Davies, were 
liberated on undertaking to abstain from politics for three 
years in lieu of banishment. Messrs Sampson and Davies, 
refusing to appeal to the executive for a reconsideration of 
their sentence, were retained for over a year. 

Sir Hercules Robinson was unfortunately in feeble health 
at the time, and having reached Pretoria on the 4th of January, 
he had to conduct negotiations under great physical TheSur* 
disadvantage. He had no sooner learnt of the raid render of 
in Cape Town than he issued a proclamation through Johannes* 
Sir Jacobus de Wet, the British resident at Pretoria, burg * 
warning all British subjects in Johannesburg or elsewhere from 
aiding and abetting Jameson. This was freely distributed 
among the public of Johannesburg. While in Pretoria the 
high commissioner in the first instance addressed himself to 
inducing Johannesburg to lay down its arms. He telegraphed 
to the reform committee that Kruger had insisted " that 
Johannesburg must lay down arms unconditionally as a 
precedent to any discussions and consideration of grievances." 
On the following day, the 7th of January, Sir Hercules tele- 
graphed again through the British agent, who was then at 
Johannesburg, saying: " That if the Uitlanders do not comply 
with my request they will forfeit all claims to sympathy from 
Her Majesty's government and from British subjects through- 
out the world, as the lives of Jameson and the prisoners are now 
practically in their hands." The* two thousand odd rifles 
which had been distributed among the Uitlanders were then 
given up. With regard to the inducements to this step urged 
upon the reform committee by the high commissioner, it is 
only necessary to say with reference to the first that the 
grievances never were considered, and with reference to the 
second it subsequently appeared that one of the conditions of 
the surrender of Jameson's force at Doornkop was that the lives 
of the men should be spared. It was after the Johannesburg 
disarmament that Kruger had sixty-four members of the 
reform committee arrested, announcing at the same time that 
his motto would be " Forget and forgive." Sir Hercules 
Robinson, in response to a message from Mr Chamberlain, who 
had been secretary of state for the colonies since July 1895, 
urging him to use firm language in reference to reasonable con- 
cessions, replied that he considered the moment inopportune, 
and on the 15th of January he left for Cape Town. In 1897 
he was succeeded in the high commissioncrship by Sir Alfred 
Milner. 

In the period which intervened between the Jameson raid 
and the outbreak of the war in October 1899 President Kruger's 
administration continued to be what it had been; 
that is to say, it was not merely bad, but it ^ J£ 
got progressively worse. His conduct immediately 
after Johannesburg had given up its arms, and while the 
reform committee were in prison, was distinctly disingenuous. 
Instead of discussing grievances, as before the Johannesburg 
disarmament he had led the high commissioner to believe was 
his intention, he proceeded to request the withdrawal of the 
London Convention, because, among other things, " it is in- 
jurious to dignity of independent republic." When Kruger 
found that no concession was to be wrung from the British 
government, he proceeded, instead of considering grievances,, 
to add considerably to their number. The Aliens Expulsion

and Aliens Immigration Laws, as well as the new Press Law, 
were passed in the latter part of 1896. 

In 1897 a decision of Chief Justice Kotze was overruled by 
an act of the volksraad. This led to a strong protest from 
the judges of the high court, and eventually led to the dis- 
missal of the chief justice, who had held that office for over 
twenty years, and during the whole of that time had been a 
loyal and patriotic friend to his country. An 'industrial 
commission appointed during this year by President Kruger 
fared no better than the high court had done. The commission 
was deputed to inquire into and report on certain of the griev- 
ances adversely affecting the gold industry. Its constitution 
for this purpose was anomalous, as it consisted almost entirely 
of Transvaal officials whose knowledge of the requirements of 
the industry was scanty. In spite of this fact, however, the 
commission reported in favour of reform in various directions. 
They urged, among other things, due enforcement of the liquor 
law, more police protection, the abolition of the dynamite 
concession, and that foodstuffs should be duty free. These 
recommendations made by President Kruger's own nominees 
were practically ignored. In 1898, to strengthen his relations 
with foreign powers, Kruger sent the state secretary, Dr Leyds, 1 
to Europe as minister plenipotentiary, his place on the Transvaal 
executive being taken by Mr Reitz, the ex-president of the 
Free State. At home Kruger continued as obdurate as ever. 
In January 1899 Mr Chamberlain pointed out in a despatch 
to President Kruger that the dynamite monopoly constituted 
a breach of the London Convention. To help the Transvaal 
government out of its difficulty, and to make one more effort 
towards conciliation, the financial houses of Johannesburg 
offered to lend the Transvaal government £600,000 wherewith 
to buy out the dynamite company, and so terminate the scandal 
and bring some relief to the industry. The offer . was not 
accepted. Meantime Sir Alfred Milner had also endeavoured 
to induce the Transvaal government to grant the necessary 
reforms, but his efforts were equally unavailing (see Milner, 
Viscount). In March the Uitlanders, hopeless of ever obtain- 
ing redress from President Kruger, weary of sending petitions 
to the Raad only to be jeered at, determined to invoke inter- 
vention if nothing else could avail, and forwarded a petition to 

Queen Victoria. This petition, the outcome of 
the Queen. tne second Uitlander movement for reform, was 

signed by 21,000 British subjects, and stated the 
Uitlander position at considerable length. The following extract 
conveys its general tenor: — 

The condition of your Majesty's subjects in this state has 
become well-nigh^ intolerable. The acknowledged and admitted 
grievances, of which your Majesty's subjects complained prior to 
1895, not only are not redressed, but exist to-day in an aggravated 
form. They are still deprived of all political rights, they are denied 
any voice in the government of the country, they are taxed far above 
the requirements of the country, the revenue of which is misapplied 
and devoted to objects which keep alive a continuous and well- 
founded feeling of irritation, without in any way advancing the 
genera^ interest of the state. Maladministration and peculation 
of public moneys go hand in hand, without any vigorous measures 
being adopted to put a stop to the scandal. The education of 
Uitlander children is made subject to impossible conditions. The 
police afford no adequate protection to the lives and property of 
the inhabitants of Johannesburg; they are rather a source of danger 
to the peace and safety of the Uitlander population. 

In response to this appeal, Mr Chamberlain, in a despatch 
dated the 10th of May, proposed a conference at Pretoria. 
Six days before Sir Alfred Milner had telegraphed to London 
a summary of the situation, comparing the position of the 
Uitlanders to that of helots and declaring the case for inter- 
vention to be overwhelming. Neither of these despatches 
was made public at the time. But on the very day Mr Cham- 
berlain wrote his despatch the friends of the Transvaal govern- 
ment in Cape Colony and the Orange Free State invited Sir 

1 Dr W. J. Leyds, a Hollander born in Java in 1855, went out to 
the Transvaal in 1884 as attorney-general and was, in 1887, made 
government commissioner for the Netherlands (S. A.) railway. In 
1890 he became state secretary and in that position was regarded as 
Krugcr's light-hand man. 



Alfred Milner to meet President Kruger at Bloemfontein, 
hoping to be able to exert pressure on both parties and to 
arrange a settlement as favourable as possible to Bioem- 
the Transvaal. The conference opened on the fonteia 
31st of May and closed on the 5th of June. It no Coafcrea < : ^ 
sooner opened than it was evident that Kruger had come to 
obtain, not to grant, concessions. He offered, it is true, a 
seven years' franchise law in place of the five years' franchise 
which Sir Alfred Milner asked for. But apart from the relief 
suggested being entirely inadequate, it was only to be given 
on certain conditions, one of which was that all future disputes 
which might arise between the Transvaal and the Imperial 
government should 'be referred to a court of; arbitration, of 
which the president should be a foreigner. No arrangement 
was possible on such terms. Meanwhile feeling was running 
high at Johannesburg and throughout South Africa. Meetings 
were held in all the large towns, at which resolutions were 
passed declaring that no solution of the Transvaal question 
would be acceptable which did not provide for equal political 
rights for all white men. Sir Alfred Milner urged the home 
government strongly to insist upon a minimum of reform, and 
primarily the five years' franchise; and Mr Chamberlain, 
backed by the cabinet, adopted the policy of the high com- 
missioner. (A. P. H.; F. R. C.) 

D. The Crisis of i8gg. — A state of extreme diplomatic 
tension lasted all the summer. The British public, in whom 
there had always been the latent desire to retrieve the surrender 
to the Boers which had followed the disaster at Majuba, were 
at last awakened by the ministerialist press to the necessity 
of vindicating British influence in South Africa, and the govern- 
ment soon found that, in spite of a highly articulate Radical 
minority, the feeling of the country was overwhelmingly behind 
them. It was not then realized either by the public or the 
government how seriously, and with what considerable justifi- 
cation, the Boers believed in their ability, if necessary, to 
sweep the British " into the sea." President Kruger had every 
expectation of large reinforcements from the Dutch in the two 
British colonies; he believed that, whatever happened, Europe 
would not allow Boer independence to be destroyed; and he 
had assured himself of the adhesion of the Orange Free State, 
though it was not till the very last moment that President 
Steyn formally notified Sir Alfred Milner of this fact. The 
Boers profoundly despised the military power of Great Britain, 
and there was no reason why they, any more than Germany 
or France, should contemplate the possibility of the empire 
standing together as a whole in such a cause. In England, on the 
other hand, it was thought by most people that if a firm enough 
attitude were adopted Mr Kruger would " climb down," and 
the effect of this error was shown partly in the whole course of 
the negotiations, partly in the tone personally adopted by Mr 
Chamberlain. It was only later that it was seen that if Great 
Britain intended effectually to champion the Uitlander cause, 
the moment for a test of strength had inevitably arrived. 
Negotiations could only bring the conflict a little nearer, delay 
it a little longer, or supply an opportunity to either side to 
justify its action in the eyes of the world. The conditions of 
the problem were such that unless Great Britain were to accept 
a humiliating rebuff, any correspondence, however skilfully 
conducted, was bound to bring into greater prominence the 
standing causes of offence between the two sides. The exchange 
of despatches soon led to a complete impasse. The persistent 
attempt of the South African Republic to assert its full indepen- 
dence, culminating in a formal denial of British suzerainty; 
made it additionally incumbent on Great Britain to carry its 
point as to the Uitlander grievances, while, from Mr Kruger's 
point of view, the admission of the Uitlanders to real political 
rights meant the doom of his oligarchical regime, and appeared 
in the light of a direct menace to Boer supremacy. The fran- 
chise, again, was an internal affair, in which the convention 
gave Great Britain no right to interfere, while if Great Britain 
relied on certain definite breaches of the convention, satisfaction 
for which was sought in the first place in such a guarantee of

amendment as the Uitlander franchise would involve, the Boer 
answer was an offer of arbitration, a course which Great Britain 
could not accept without admitting the South African Republic 
to the position of an equal. Here was material enough for an 
explosion, even if personal misunderstandings and aggravations, 
adding fuel to the fire, had not naturally occurred (or even been 
deliberately plotted) during the negotiations. But the truth 
was that the Boers thought they stood to gain by fighting, 
while the British, though not expecting war, and acting up till 
the last month or so on the assumption that serious military 
preparations were either unnecessary or sufficiently unlikely 
to be necessary to make them politically inexpedient, had with 
no less confidence committed themselves to a policy which 
was impracticable on peaceful terms. 

After July the tactics of the Boer executive were simply 
directed towards putting off a crisis till the beginning of October, 
when the grass would be growing on the veld, and meanwhile 
towards doing all they could in their despatches to put the 
blame on Great Britain. At last they drafted, on the 27th of 
September, an ultimatum to the British government. But, 
although ready drafted, many circumstances conspired to 
delay its presentation. Meanwhile, the British war office 
began to act. Certain departmental details were despatched 
to South Africa to form a working nucleus for military bases, 
and early in September the cabinet sanctioned the despatch 
to Natal from India of a mixed force, 5600 strong, while two 
battalions were ordered to South Africa from the Mediterranean. 
Sir George White was nominated to the chief command of the 
forces in Natal, and sailed on the 16th of September, while 
active preparations were set on foot in England to prepare 
against the necessity of despatching an army corps to Cape Town ; 
In which case the chief command was to be vested in Sir Redvers 
Buller. Fortunately, although the draft of an ultimatum was 
lying in the state secretary's office in Pretoria, the Boers, 
unprepared in departmental arrangements which are necessary 
in large military operations, were unable to take the field with 
the promptitude that the situation demanded. They con- 
sequently forfeited many of the advantages of the initiative. 

The military strength of the two republics was practically 
an unknown quantity. It was certain that, since the troublous 
times of 1896, the Transvaal had greatly increased its arma- 
ments; but at their best, except by a very few, 1 the Boers were 
looked upon by British military experts as a disorganized rabble, 
which, while containing many individual first-class marksmen, 
would be incapable of maintaining a prolonged resistance 
against a disciplined army. As was to be subsequently shown, 
the hostilities were not confined to opposition from the fighting 
strength of the two little republics alone; the British had to 
face Dutch opposition in their own colonies. The total 
fighting strength of the Boer republics is difficult to ascertain 
exactly. General Botha stated that there were 83,000 burghers 
from i$ to 65 years of age on the commando lists. Lord 
Kitchener put the total number of combatants on the Boer 
side at 95,000 (Cd, 1790, p. 13). The British official History of 
the War gave the number as 87,000; another calculation, based 
on the number killed, taken prisoner and surrendered, made 
the total 90,000. In the second (1901) rebellion of the Cape 
Dutch about 8000 joined the burgher forces. The number of 
Boers in the field at any one period was probably little more 
than 40,000. But the fact that it was to a large extent a 
struggle with a nation in arms doubled the numbers of the 
force that the Transvaal executive was able to draw upon. 
The bulk of the Dutch levies were organized on the burgher 
system — that is, each district was furnished with a commandant, 
who had under him field-cornets and assistant field-cornets, 
who administered the fighting capacity of the district. Each 
field-cornet, who, with the commandant, was a paid official 
of the state, was responsible for the arms, equipment and 
attendance of his commando. 

1 Lord Wolseley foresaw the strength of the Boers. Writing 
on the 12th of September 1899 he said, " If this war comes off it 
will be the most serious war England has ever had" (see Military 
Life of the Duke of Cambridge, ii. 421). 



The plan of campaign which found favour with the Boers, 
when they determined to put their differences with Great 
Britain to the test by the ordeal of the sword, was to attack 
all the principal British towns adjacent to their own borders; 
at the same time to despatch a field army of the necessary 
dimensions to invade and reduce Natal, where the largest 
British garrison existed. It is not too much to suppose that the 
executive in Pretoria had calculated that the occupation of 
Durban would inspire the entire Dutch nation with a spirit 
of unanimity which would eventually wrest South Africa from 
the British. On paper the scheme had everything to recom- 
mend it as the expedient most likely to bring about the desired 
end. But the departmental executive could not launch the 
Natal invading force as early as had been anticipated, and it 
was not until the 9th of October that the ultimatum was pre- 
sented to Sir (then Mr) Conyngham Greene, the British agent 
at Pretoria. The scheduled demands were as follow : — 

" a. That all points of mutual difference shall be regulated 
by the friendly course of arbitration, or by what- rhe 
ever amicable way may be agreed upon by the ultimatum. 
government with Her Majesty's Government. 

" 6. That the troops on the borders of this republic 
shall be instantly withdrawn. 

" c. That all reinforcements of troops which have arrived 
in South Africa since the 1st of June 1899 shall be removed 
from South Africa within a reasonable time, to be agreed 
upon with this government, and with a mutual assurance 
and guarantee on the part of this government that no 
attack upon or hostilities against any portion of the posses- 
sions of the British Government shall be made by the republic 
during further negotiations within a period of time to 
be subsequently agreed upon between the governments, and 
this government will, on compliance therewith, be prepared 
to withdraw the armed burghers of this republic from the 
borders. 

" d. That Her Majesty's troops now on the high seas shall 
not be landed in any part of South Africa." 

To these demands the Transvaal government required an 
answer within 48 hours. 

There could be only one reply, and on Wednesday, the nth 
of October 1899, at five o'clock p.m., a state of war existed 
between the British government and the two Boer republics. 
On the following day the Boer attack on an armoured train at 
Kraaipan, a railway station in Cape Colony south of Mafeking 
and close to the western frontier of the Transvaal, witnessed 
the first hostile shot of a bloody war, destined to plunge South 
Africa into strife for two years and a half. (H. Ch.) 

E. The War of i8gg-igo2. — For the purposes of history 
the South African War may be conveniently divided into 
five distinct periods. The first comprises the Boer * 

invasion, terminating with the relief of Ladysmith th/war. 
on the 28th of February. The second, the period 
of Boer organized resistance, may be said to have finished 
with the occupation of Komati Poort in October 1900 (a 
month after Lord Roberts's formal annexation of the Trans- 
vaal) and the flight of President Kruger. The third may 
be characterized as a period of transition; it marks the 
adoption jn earnest of a guerrilla policy on the part of the 
enemy, and an uncertain casting about on the part of the British 
for a definite system with which to grapple with an unfore- 
seen development. This phase endured up to the failure of 
the Middelburg negotiations in March 1901. The next stage 
was that which saw the slow building up of the blockhouse 
system and the institution of small punitive columns, and may 
be considered to have extended until the close of 1901. The 
fifth, and last period — which, after all other expedients had failed, 
finally brought the residue of uncaptured and unsurrendered 
burghers to submission — was the final development of the 
blockhouse system, wedded to the institution of systematic 

driving " of given areas, which operations were in force until 
the 31st of May 1902, when peace was ratified at Pretoria. 

The first of these periods saw the severest fighting of the

TRANSVAAL 



[WAR OF 1 899-1902 



campaign. It opened with the investment of Mafeking by a 
Transvaal force under P. A. Cronje and the envelopment of 

Kimberley by Free State commandos under General 
toNatai. 03 Wessels. But these were minor operations. The main 

Boer effort was made in Natal, where their forces were 
commanded by P. J. Joubert, while Lieut.-General Sir George 
White was the British commander-in-chief. The northern part of 
Natal presented two faces of a triangle to the two enemies, the 
short base being formed by the Tugela river. Close to the head of 
the triangle at Dundee and Glencoe was posted a small British 
force under Major-General Sir W. Penn Symons. Against this 
force there advanced a Boer force under Lukas Meyer from the 
east, and, more slowly, the foremost portion of the main Boer 
army from the north, while at the same time other Transvaalers 
descended upon the railway between Glencoe and Ladysmith, and 
the Free Staters from the passes of the Drakensberg advanced 
towards Ladysmith, the British centre of operations at which the 
reinforcements sent from India gathered. On the 20th of Octo- 
ber the Dundee brigade vigorously and successfully attacked 
Talana Hill, and drove hack Lukas Meyer, but this success was 
dearly bought. Symons was mortally wounded, and 226 officers 
and men were killed and wounded. Half the mounted men lost 
their way in attempting to pass the enemy's flank and were 
taken, and the brigade, threatened to its left rear by Joubert's 
advance and by the force that had seized the railway, only escaped 
being enveloped by retreating upon Ladysmith, where it arrived 
in an exhausted state on the 26th of October. Meanwhile 
Sir George White had discovered the Boer force on the railway, 
and, though anxious on account of the advance of the Free 
Staters, on the 21st, stimulated by the news of Talana, he sent 
out a force of all arms under General (Sir John) French to drive 
the Boers from Elandslaagte and so to clear. Symons's line of 
retreat. This was accomplished by French and his subordinate, 
Colonel (Sir) Ian Hamilton, in the action of Elandslaagte on the 
21st of October (British losses, 258 all ranks). But on the 22nd 
the Free Staters' advance caused the victorious force to be 
recalled to Ladysmith, and the third action north of that town, 
Rietfontein (24th), was only a demonstration to cover the retire- 
ment of the Dundee force. By the 29th of October all the British 
forces at the front and their reinforcements had fallen in on 
Ladysmith, which the Transvaalers on the north and east and 
the Free Staters on the west side began to invest. Before the 
junction of the two allied wings was complete Sir George White 
attempted by a general attack to break up their line. The 
result of this decision was the battle of Lombard's Kop, outside 
Ladysmith, in which the whole of the available British force was 
engaged. The engagement was disastrous to the British, who 
had undertaken far too comprehensive an attack, and the Natal 
Field Force was obliged to fall back upon Ladysmith with the 
loss of 1 500 men, including a large number of prisoners belonging 
to the left column under Lieut.-Colonel F.R.C. Carleton,who were 
cut off at Nicholson's Nek and forced to surrender by a mixed 
force of Transvaalers and Free Staters under Christian de Wet. 
From that day the r61e of the Natal Field Force was changed from 
that of a mobile field army into that of a garrison, and two 
days later it was completely isolated, but not before General 
French had succeeded in escaping south by train, and the naval 
authorities had been induced by Sir George White's urgent 
appeals to send into the town a naval brigade with a few guns 
of sufficient range and calibre to cope with the heavy position 
artillery which Joubert was now able to bring into action against 
the town. 

General Sir Redvers Buller, who had been appointed to the 
supreme command in South Africa as soon as it was perceived 

that war was imminent — his force being one army 
Arrival, corps in three divisions, the divisional generals being 

Lord Methuen, Sir W. Gatacre and Sir C. F. Clery — 
arrived in Cape Town, ahead of his troops, on the day following 
Lombard's Kop. The situation which presented itself was deli- 
cate in the extreme. In Natal practically the whole of the avail- 
able defence force was swallowed up by the steady success of the 
invasion; on the western frontier two British towns were isolated 



and besieged; and Boer commandos were on the point of in- 
vading Cape Colony, where the Dutch population seemed on the 
verge of rebellion. The army corps was about to arrive, practi- 
cally as a whole unit, in South Africa; but it was evident that 
the exigencies of the situation, and the widely divided areas of 
invasion, would at least defer, the execution of the plan which 
had been formed for an invasion of the Orange Free State from 
Cape Colony. The first duty was to effect the relief of the British 
forces which had been rendered immobile, and another duty 
imposed by political circumstances was to relieve Kimberley 
(where Cecil Rhodes was), while the prospect of rebellion forbade 
the complete denudation of the central part of the colony. 
Thus Sir Redvers Buller had no choice but to disintegrate the 
army corps. Clery and some brigades were sent to Natal ; Gatacre 
with less than a brigade, instead of a division, was despatched to 
Queenstown, Cape Colony; while Lord Methuen, with a division, 
was sent off to relieve Kimberley. As November wore on, the 
situation did not improve. Cape Colony was invaded; while in 
Natal a flying column of Boers, pushing down from the Tugela, 
for a short time isolated the newly-arrived force under General 
(Sir) H. J. T. Hildyard, which opposed Joubert's advance on 
Pietermaritzburg at Estcourt. The situation in Natal seemed 
so serious that on the 22nd of November Sir Redvers Buller left 
Cape Town and sailed for Durban. In the meantime Lord 
Methuen had commenced his march to the relief of Kimberley. 
He encountered resistance at Belmont 011 the 23rd, but attack- 
ing resolutely he drove the Boers out of their strong Failures of 
positions. Two days later he won another action at Methuen 
Enslin. Still persevering he moved on to the Modder, a^G^cre* 
where he was seriously opposed by De la Rey and P. A. Cronje, 
the latter having posted down from Mafeking with 2000 men and 
arrived on the previous night. The Boers, who held a river 
line, kept the British attack at bay all day, but eventually fell 
hack, relinquishing the position after dark, as their right had been 
turned by General Pole-Carew's brigade. It was a long and 
wearing fight, in which the British lost 485 killed and wounded, 
and what was more serious, Lord Methuen (himself wounded) 
found that his force had exhausted its forward momentum, and 
that he would have to collect supplies and reinforcements on the 
Modder before fighting his next battle. The extent of the opera- 
tions and the gravity of the situation now began to be felt in 
England; every available man was called up from the reserves, 
and the war office made what at the time appeared to be ade- 
quate provision for the waste which it was seen would occur. 
On the 30th of November the mobilization of a sixth division 
was ordered, offers of colonial aid were accepted, and every 
facility provided for local recruiting in the South African ports. 
Thus in the early days of December confidence was considerably 
restored. Buller was arranging for the relief of Ladysmith, 
which had already shown its spirit by two successful sorties 
against the besiegers' batteries. In every theatre the British 
strength was consolidating. But the full significance of the 
situation presented by thtse two small nations in arms had not 
yet been appreciated. The confidence restored by the lull 
during the early part of December was destined to be roughly 
shattered. On the 10th of December Gatacre essayed a night 
march and attack upon the enemy's position at Stormberg, and, 
misled by his guides in unknown ground, was himself surprised 
and forced to return with a loss of 719. On the following day 
Lord Methuen delivered an attack upon Cronje's position be- 
tween the Upper Modder river and the Kimberley road, a line of 
kopjes called Spytfontein and Magersfontein. In a night attack 
on Magersfontein hill the Highland brigade came under heavy 
fire while still in assembly formation, and lost its general, A. G. 
Wauchope, and 750 men, and in the battle by day which followed 
the other brigades were unable to retrieve the failure, the total 
losses amounting to about 950. But even this could be suffered 
with equanimity, since Buller was about to bring his own force 
into play, and Buller, it was confidently supposed, would not 
fail. He had collected at Chieveley in Natal a brigade of mounted 
men, four brigades of infantry and six batteries of artillery, and 
he carried with him the trust alike of the army and the nation.

On the 15th of December Buller made his effort and failed. 
Behind the Tugela at Colenso were Louis Botha's forces 
B iter's covering the siege of Ladysmith, and, imperfectly 
Failure. acquainted with the topography, Buller sent a 
Lord Roberts force to turn Botha's left, in conjunction with a 
sent out. f ronta i attack. But the flank attack became 
entangled in mass in a loop of the river and suffered heavily, 
and two batteries that formed part of the frontal attack came 
into action within a few hundred yards of unsuspected Boer 
trenches, with the result that ten guns were lost, as well as 
in all some 1100 men. Buller then gave up the fight. The full 
nature of the failure was not realized by the British public, nor 
the spirit in which the general had received the finding of fortune. 
He lost heart, and actually suggested to White the surrender of 
Ladysmith, believing this to be inevitable and desiring to cover 
White's responsibility in that event with his own authority; 
but White replied that he did not propose to surrender, and the 
cabinet at home, aware of Buller's despondency, appointed Field 
Marshal Lord Roberts to the supreme command, with Major- 
General Lord Kitchener as his chief of staff. A wave of military 
enthusiasm arose throughout the empire, and as the formation 
of a seventh division practically drained the mother-country of 
trained men, a scheme for the employment of amateur soldiers 
was formulated, resulting in the despatch of Imperial Yeomanry 
and Volunteer contingents, which proved one of the most striking 
features of the South African campaign. Pending the arrival of 
Lord Roberts and reinforcements, the situation in South Africa 
remained at a deadlock: the three besieged towns — Maf eking, 
Kimberley and Ladysmith — still held their own, but no headway 
was made by the relief columns; all they could do was to stand 
on the defensive. The only bright spot, as far as the British 
were concerned, was to be found in northern Cape Colony, where 
General French, with two cavalry brigades and details, by his 
skilful tactics and wonderful activity kept at arm's length a 
superior force of the enemy in the vicinity of Colesberg, an 
achievement the more noteworthy since he had pitted against 
him both De la Rey and De Wet, two of the three men of military 
genius produced by the war on the Boer side. On the 6th of 
January the Boers in Naial made a desperate attempt to storm 
Ladysmith. The garrison, though already weakened by priva- 
tion and sickness, made a stubborn resistance, and after one of 
the fiercest engagements of the war, repulsed the attack at 
Caesar's Camp and Wagon Hill with severe loss to the enemy, 
itself having 500 casualties. 

When Lord Roberts arrived in Cape Town on the 10th of 
January 1900 the three garrisons were still invested, and the 
relieving forces were still maintaining their r61e of passive resist- 
ance, while at the same time restraining the Dutch in Cape Colony. 
The commander-in-chief's first duty was to create a field army 
out of the tangle of units in Cape Colony. In the meantime, Sir 
Redvers Buller, who had been reinforced by Sir Charles Warren 
and the 5th division, essayed a second attempt to cross the 
Tugela, by turning the Boer left. But much time was consumed 
and the plan underwent several modifications before its execu- 
tion began in earnest on the 16th of January. Warren was placed 
in command of the main body, which crossed the Tugela at 
Trichardt's Drift on the 17th and 18th. The mounted troops 
engaged a Boer force north-west of the point of 
passage, but were brought back to take . part in a 
general right wheel of the forces of the Tugela, pivoting on 
Trichardt's Drift. But meantime the mobile enemy, whose 
original flank had been turned, had gathered at the new centre 
of gravity, and the upshot of several days' fighting was the 
retreat of the British. They had penetrated the enemy's right 
centre by the seizure of Spion Kop, but the force there 
became the target for the concentrated attacks of the Boers, 
and, after suffering heavily, was withdrawn (Jan. 24, 1900), 
with a loss of 1700 men. 

By the 1st of February Lord Roberts had matured his plans 
and begun to prepare for their execution. On the 3rd of February 
he ordered a demonstration against the right of the Boer 
position at Spytfontein-Magersfontein to cover the withdrawal 



Spion Kop. 



of General French and the cavalry from before Colesberg, and 
the concentration of his army at Modder River, disregarding 
another set-back in Natal to Sir Redvers Buller, who had against 
his advice made a third attempt to relieve Ladysmith on the 
5th of February, and failed to make good the purchase which 
he secured across the Tugela (Vaal Krantz). 

Lord Roberts's plan was first to concentrate to his left, taking 
every measure to induce the Boers to believe that the original 
scheme of invasion by the centre would now be re- 
sumed, and in this purpose he succeeded so well that Evince! 
his field army with the necessary transport for a 
cross-country march was assembled between the Orange and 
the Modder without serious mishap. Cronje at the new centre 
of gravity was not reinforced, all available Boers drawing down 
towards Colesberg. The concentration effected, Cronje still 
believed that the relief of Kimberley was the object of the 
gathering behind Modder River, and therefore held on to his 
Magersfontein kopje. The relief of Kimberley was indeed 
urgent, for dissensions between Rhodes and the military authori- 
ties had become acute. But to this part of the task only the 
cavalry division assembled under French was assigned. The 
army itself was to force Cronje into the open and then advance 
on Bloemfontein from the west. Roberts began his operations 
on the nth of February. French started from Ramdam (near 
Graspan) eastward on that day, intending to make a wide sweep 
round Cronje's immobile army. Skirmishing with De Wet 
in the first stages of their ride, the cavalry brigades crossed the 
Modder at Klip Drift on the 13th. Cronje sent only detach- 
ments to oppose them, but these detachments were broken 
through by a sword-in-hand charge of the whole division, and 
Kimberley was relieved on the 15th. The infantry, meeting 
with great difficulties in its crossing of the Riet at Waterval 
owing to the country and its own unwieldy transport, followed 
1 J to 2 days later. But Cronje had now realized his danger, 
and slipped away westward behind French and in p a « rrfe A enr 
front of the leading infantry at Klip Drift. This 
was deflected by Kitchener westward to follow up the Boer 
rearguard, and after some delay the remainder of the infantry, 
at first fronting northwards, swerved westward likewise, while 
French from Kimberley, with such of his men as he could mount 
on serviceable horses, headed off Cronje in the north-west. The 
result, after one premature and costly assault on Cronje's lines 
had been made by Kitchener, was the surrender of 4000 Boers 
at Paardeberg with their leader on the 29th of February, the 
anniversary of Majuba. At the same moment came in news at 
last of the relief of Ladysmith. 

It was part of Roberts's purpose to reheve the pressure in 
Natal by his own operations. Buller began his fourth advance 
on the 14th of February, and though this was R u t t 
checked the foothold gained was not abandoned, ^^ysmtth^ 
and a fifth and last attempt (Pieter's Hill) was 
successful. Ladysmith was relieved on the 28th of February. 
It had fared worst of all the beleaguered garrisons, and its 
22,000 inhabitants were almost at their last gasp when relief 
came. The casualties from shell-fire had been few, but those 
from sickness were very heavy. Buller's operations, too, had 
cost at Colenso 1100 men, at Spion Kop 1700, at Vaalkrantz 400, 
and now in the last long-drawn effort 1600 more — over 5000 in 
all. But the tide of war had changed. The Natal invaders 
fell back to the mountains which enclose the north of the colony; 
Oliver and Schoeman retired from Cape Colony before the small 
forces of Gatacre and Clements; and the presidents of the 
republics, realizing that the British Empire was capable of 
more resistance than they had calculated upon, put forward 
feelers aiming at the restoration of the status quo before the 
war. These proposals were rejected by Lord Salisbury: there 
could be no end now but a complete destruction of the Boer 
power. 

The surrender of Cronje and the relief of Ladysmith for the 
time being paralysed the Boer resistance. Two half-hearted 
attempts were made on the 7th and 10th of March, at Poplar 
Grove and Driefontein, to stem Lord Roberts's advance upon

to give confidence to his burghers; but the demoralization was 
so great that neither the military genius of the few 
Capture of nor ^g personal influence of the president could 
fonteto. bolster up an adequate resistance, and on the 13th 
of March 1900 Lord Roberts's army marched into the 
Free State capital. This great move was persevered in and 
accomplished, in spite of the fact that at the very outset of the 
cross-country march (February 13) the great body of transport 
which had been collected at Ramdam had been cut off by 
De Wet (who had stayed on the Rict after French had 
shaken him off). It was therefore only made possible at all 
by reducing the rations of the fighting men to a minimum and 
by undertaking the risks of changing the line of communi- 
cation three times. Naturally and necessarily the capture of 
Bloemfontein was followed by a period of reaction. It w^as 
not until the 29th of March that the new railway communi- 
cation recommenced to feed the army. In the meantime 
rebellion had broken out in the Prieska district of Cape Colony, 
which was promptly quelled by Lord Kitchener. The halt at 
Bloemfontein was marked by the publication of proclamations, 
offering protection to the burghers, which, however, the invaders 
had not yet the power to fulfil. The enforced halt was unfor- 
tunate; it not only resulted in a bad outbreak of enteric, but it 
gave the Boers time to recuperate, and by the beginning of April 
they again took the initiative. The death of their commandant- 
general, Piet Joubert, on the 28th of March, seemed to mark a 
change in the fortunes of the Republican army. Christian De 
Wet, who had first come into prominence as the captor of Lord 
Roberts's convoy at Waterval, and was now operating east and 
south-west of Bloemfontein in order to counteract the influence of 
Roberts's numerous flying columns which rode hither and thither 
offering peace, added to his laurels by ambushing Broadwood's 
mounted brigade and horse artillery at Sannah's Post, just 
outside Bloemfontein, on the 31st of March. Four days later 
he reduced a detachment at Reddersburg, and then went 
south and invested Colonel Dalgety and a mixed force at 
Wepener, which was relieved after ten days by General Hunter's 
Ladysmith division, brought round to Aliwal North from Natal. 
These successes, if they retarded Roberts's progress, at least 
enabled him to rearrange his forces in accordance with the new 
situation at leisure, and to re-establish his trans- 
port, rail and wheeled, and on the 1st of May the 
main army moved northwards upon the Transvaal 
capital. The main advance was taken with one cavalry 
and three infantry divisions (the cavalry commanded by 
French, and the infantry divisions by Generals Tucker, Pole- 
Carew and Ian Hamilton). Rundle's division took the right of 
the advance; Methuen and Hunter moving from Kimberley, 
formed the left. Kelly Kenny, Colvile and Chermside held the 
communications based on Bloemfontein. A flying column de- 
tached from Hunter, under Mahon, in conjunction with Colonel 
H. C. 0. Plumer's Rhodcsian levies from the north, on the 17th of 
May relieved Mafeking, where Colonel (Lieut. -General Sir) R. S. S. 
Baden-Powell had throughout shown a bold front and by his 
unconventional gaiety as well as his military measures had held 
off the assault until the last. The same day the Natal Field 
Force under Buller moved up into the Biggarsberg and occupied 
Dundee. On the 10th of May Lord Roberts had crossed the 
Sand River; on the 12th of May he entered Kroonstad. After 
a halt of eight days at Kroonstad, the main army again moved 
forward, and, meeting but small resistance, marched without a 
halt into Johannesburg, which was occupied on the 31st of May, 
the Orange Free State having been formally annexed 
Pretoria? ' by Proclamation three days earlier. On the 30th of 
May President Kruger fled with the state archives, 
taking up his residence at Waterval Boven on the Komati Poort 
line. The gold mines were now securely in the possession of the 
British, and on the 5th of June Lord Roberts's army occupied the 
capital of the Transvaal practically without resistance, setting 
free about 3000 British prisoners of war detained there. 
It had been anticipated that the occupation of both the 



Relief of 
Mdfeklng. 



capitals would have brought the hostilities to a close, but this 
was not the case, and though after the 5th of June regular re- 
sistance was at an end, the army of occupation had 
still to face two years of almost unprecedented par- «/» m0I,rf 
tisan warfare. On the 8th of June Sir Redvers Buller, 
who had made a long halt after the relief of Ladysmith and 
reorganized his army and its line of communication, forced his 
way over Alleman's Nek, and on the following day occupied 
Laing's Nek, the Natal gate to the Transvaal, while the field 
marshal fought a widespread battle against Botha, De la Rey 
and Kemp at Diamond Hill, 20 m. east of Pretoria. The object 
of this action was to push back the Boers from the neighbourhood 
of Pretoria, but no sooner was this done than the ncrth-western 
Transvaal became active, in spite of Hunter's and Baden-Powell's 
advance from Mafeking through this district. As the British 
line of operations now extended eastward from Pretoria, the 
advance of these Boers to the Magaliesberg threatened their 
rearward communications, and as Buller had moved far more 
slowly than the main army there was not as yet an alternative 
line through Natal. Most serious of all was the pressure between 
Bloemfontein and the Vaal, where the Free Staters, under De 
Wet and other commanders, had initiated the guerrilla as soon 
as Botha and the Transvaalers retired over the Vaal and ceased 
to defend them by regular operations. Large forces had been 
left behind during the advance on Johannesburg for 
the protection of the railway and the conquered terri- ^ insr °^ s 
tory, and these were now reinforced from Kimberley 
and elsewhere as well as from detachments of the main army. 
These, under Sir Archibald Hunter and Sir Leslie Rundle, 
successfully herded Prinsloo with, 4000 Free Staters into the 
Brandwater Basin (July 29) — a very satisfactory result, but 
one seriously marred by the escape of De Wet, who soon 
afterwards raided the Western Transvaal and again escaped 
between converging pursuers under Kitchener, Methuen, Smith- 
Dorrien, Ian Hamilton and Baden-Powell. 

Before this Lord Roberts had initiated a movement from 
Pretoria to sweep down to Komati Poort on the Portuguese 
frontier, in which Buller, advancing across country from the 
south, was to co-operate. On the 26th to 27th of August the 
combined forces engaged and defeated Botha in the action of 
Belfast or Bergendal, with the result that the enemy dispersed 
into the bush-veld north of the Middelburg railway. On the 
30th of August the remainder of the British prisoners were 
released at Nooitgedacht. On the 6th of September Buller, 
crossing the track of the main army at right angles, occupied 
Lydenburg in the bush-veld, and five days later the aged presi- 
dent of the republic took refuge in Lourenco Marques. 
On the 13th of September Barberton was occupied Kruger! 
by French, and on the 25th Komati Poort by 
Roberts's infantry. From October the military operations were 
confined to attempts to reduce guerrilla commandos which had 
taken the field. Mr Kruger, deserting his countrymen, left, 
for Europe in a Dutch man-of-war, and General Buller sailed 
for Europe. The Boer leaders definitely decided upon a guerrilla 
and a wearing policy, deliberately dispersed their field army, 
and then swelled and multiplied the innumerable local com- 
mandos. On the 25th of the month the ceremony of annexing 
the Transvaal was performed at Pretoria. 

In November the prevailing opinion, was that the war was over, 
and Lord Roberts, who had been appointed commander-in-chief* 
at home, left South Africa, handing over the command to 
Lord Kitchener. Then followed a long period of groping Kitchener 
for a means to cope with the development of guerrilla *f* es 
tactics, which for the next six months were at their zenith. "»«"»*"«• 
The railway communications were constantly damaged, isolated 
posts and convoys captured, and the raiders always seemed able 
to avoid contact with the columns sent in pursuit. De Wet, after 
escaping from Brandwater Basin, was hunted north-westward, and 
crossed into the Transvaal, where, joining the local guerrilla bands, 
he surrounded an infantry brigade at Fredrikstad. But, Ra'dsb? 
unable to reduce it, and threatened on all sides, he DeWeU 
turned back. On the 6th of November he was severely 
handled and his guns and wagons captured at Bothaville. But 
this misadventure only stimulated him. His emissaries roused the 
Free Staters west of Bloemfontein, and disaffection broke out in

Cape Colony to an alarming degree, while, as forerunners of the 
promised invasion, scattered bodies of Free Staters crossed the 
Orange River to swell the rebellion. From Bothaville De Wet made 
for Thaba Nchu, where the Bloemfontein garrison held a cordon of 
posts. These were traversed on the 16th of November and the 
raiders passea on to Bethulie capturing Dewetsdorp and 500 men en 
route. Pursued closely and finding the rivers in flood De Wet hid 
some of his men under Kritzinger near the Orange and himself 
doubled back, traversing again the line of posts east of Bloemfontein. 
Kritzinger, Hertzog and bodies of Cape rebels raided Cape Colony 
as soon as they were able to cross the Orange, and Hertzog penetrated 
so far that he exchanged shots on the Atlantic coast with a British 
warship. All that the British forces under Sir Charles Knox and 
others could do was to localize the raids and to prevent 
the spread of rebellion. So far, however, energy and 
vigilance made them successful. Botha meanwhile 
held his own in the northern Transvaal, both against forces from 
Pretoria, Middelburg and Lydenburg, and against the Rhodesian 
Field Force under Sir F. Harrington, which had been sent up from 
Beira (by arrangement with the Portuguese) to southern Rhodesia. 
At the close of 1900 the commandos under the direct influence of 
Louis Botha attacked the railway posts on the Middelburg railway 
and captured Helvetia. De la Rey operated in the western Trans- 
vaal, and in concert with Beyers, whose presence in this region was 
not known to the British, he inflicted a sharp reverse on General 
R. A. P. Clements at Nooitgedacht in the Hekpoort valley on the 
13th of December. Beyers then slipped away to the east, crossing 
the line between Johannesburg and Pretoria with impunity. Lord 
Kitchener called for more men, and on the 22nd of December the 
war office announced that 30,000 more mounted men would be 
despatched to the seat of war. 

With the opening of 1901 Lord Kitchener tried new schemes. 
He withdrew all his detached garrisons except in the most important 
Concentra- centres t and set himself to make his railway communica- 
tton Policy. tlons perfectly secure. He determined to make the 
area of operations a waste, and instituted the concentra- 
tion camps, into which he intended to bring the whole of the non- 
combatant inhabitants of the two republics. He despatched French 
with a large force to clear the south-eastern districts of the Transvaal 
and for the rest maintained a force to watch De Wet, and organized a 
defence force in Cape Colony, while using the residue of his mounted 
men to sweep the country of stock, forage and inhabitants. 
Although there were no great disasters, the new policy was not prolific 
in success. The enemy invariably dispersed before superior forces, 
and the removal of the women and children from the farms did not 
have the effect of disheartening the burghers as had been anticipated 
— it rather mended their vitality by relieving them of responsibility 
for their families' welfare. Nor were the Boer leaders destitute of 
comprehensive schemes. Botha arranged to penetrate Natal, De 
Wet to make a second attempt on the Cclony, in connexion with 
Hertzog and Kritzinger. On the 10th of February De Wet, with 
five guns and 3000 men, carried out his promised invasion of Cape 
Colony. Passing the Bloemfontein-Thaba Nchu line a third time, he 
crossed the Orange to join Hertzog and rouse the Cape Dutch. But 
this invasion failed. By judicious use of the railway Kitchener 
concentrated sufficient troops in the colony to cope with the attempt, 
and, after being hunted for eighteen days, De Wet escaped back 
into the Orange River Colony with the loss of all his guns, munitions 
of war and half his force. In the northern Transvaal a force under 
Sir Bindon Blood cleared the country, but could not prevent Viljoen 
from escaping eastward to join Botha. Botha's activity in the 
south-east caused Kitchener to despatch a large force under French 
thither. This swept the country up to the Swaziland border. But 
Botha escaped. On the 3rd of March, after various raids and adven- 
tures in company with Smuts and Kemp, De la Rey, the lion of the 
western Transvaal, essayed an attack upon Lichtenburg, in which 
he was heavily repulsed. Signs of weakness were now apparent, 
and as a result Louis Botha, acting with the authority of Schalk 
Burger^ the representative of President Kruger, opened negotiations 
with Kitchener. A meeting took place at Middelburg, Transvaal, 
on the 28th of February. These negotiations, however, broke down 
mainly over the treatment to be awarded to Cape rebels. 

The hostilities now entered upon a new phase. The establishment 
of a line of defensive posts between Blotmfontein and Ladybrand, 
Blockhouse tn . 0U S n De Wet nad tnree times traversed it, had given 
Policy. Kitchener an idea, and he resolved upon the scheme of 

fencing in areas by chains of blockhouses such as 
those already constructed for the protection of the railways. In 
the meantime, while these posts were under construction, the harrying 
of the commandos by mobile columns was continued. In March 
Babington, pursuing De la Rey after the latter's Lichtenburg mis- 
adventure, captured three guns and six maxims near Ventersdorp. 
In April Plumer occupied Pietersburg, the last remaining seat of 
government open to the enemy. Rawlinson captured a laager and 
guns at Klcrksdorp, and, though neither De Wet nor De la Rey had 
been brought to book, matters had so far improved in May that 
municipal government was given to Johannesburg, and a certain 
number of mines were allowed to recommence working. Kemp was 
defeated by Dixon at Vlakfontein, after a desperate encounter. 
June brought little of moment, though the Boers scored two minor 



successes, Kritzinger capturing the village of Jamestown in Cape 
Colony, and Muller reducing a force of Victorians at Wilmansrust, 
south of Middelburg. In July there were further evidences of weak- 
ness on the part of the Boers, and Botha applied for permission to 
communicate with Kruger. This was allowed, but, as Kruger 
advised a continuance of the struggle, the slow course of the war 
continued. In the meantime, the concentration camps were becom- 
ing filled to overflowing, and a steady stream of captures and 
surrenders were reducing the hostile power of the republics. 

In August a proclamation was promulgated formally threatening 
the Boer leaders who should not surrender with permanent banish- 
ment from South Africa, but this proclamation had very little 
effect. Smuts, with a small force from the Magaliesberg, traversed 
Orange River Colony and stimulated the Cape rebels afresh. But 
September showed some slight improvement in the situation in Cape 
Colony, where French was in supreme command. On the 5th 
Scobell captured Lotter, who was subsequently executed for 
murder: though this was balanced a few days later by Smuts's 
successful attack on the 17th Lancers at Tarkastad. In the 
south-eastern Transvaal Botha made a new effort to invade Natal, 
but, although he captured 300 men and three guns in an action 
on the 17th of September at Blood River Poort near Vryheid, his 
plans were rendered abortive by his failure to reduce the posts of 
Mount Prospect and Fort Itala in Zululand, which he attacked on 
the 26th, and he only escaped with difficulty from the converging 
columns sent against him. Desultory fighting continued till the 
close of the year, the balance of success being with the British, 
though on the £Oth of October Botha, returning from the south-east 
towards Pretoria, defeated Colonel Benson's column at Bakenlaagte, 
Benson being killed. About the same time, the force in front of 
De la Rey and Kemp in the west being depleted to find the troops 
for larger operations, the Boers made a fierce surprise attack on 
Colonel Kekewich's column at Moedville, in which Kekewich was 
wounded and his troops hard pressed for a time. De la Rey next 
attacked part of Methuen's column near Zeerust, but was repulsed 
(Oct. 24). Affairs again took an unsatisfactory turn in Cape 
Colony, and on the 8th of October the whole colony was placed under 
martial law. In November an unsuccessful attempt was made by 
several columns to run De Wet to earth in the Lindley district, 
whither, after his second raid on Cape Colony, he had returned. 
But in December matters improved. The reverse at Bakenlaagte 
was repaired by a force under Bruce Hamilton. This swept the 
south-eastern Transvaal as French had done, and with no better 
effect, for Botha escaped. But the British commander thereupon 
began a constant succession of night marches and raids which practi- 
cally blotted out the resistance in the eastern Transvaal. The 
corps of National Scouts (formed of burghers who had taken the 
oath of allegiance) was inaugurated and the Johannesburg stock 
exchange reopened. jBy the end of the year the blockhouse system 
was complete, but this phase of the war was destined to close badly 
as De Wet on Christmas Eve captured a large force of Yeomanry 
at Tweefontein, west of Harrismith. 

With 1902 the last phase of this protracted struggle commenced. 
The blockhouse system was practically finished, and Kitchener 
determined upon a new means of harassing the 
enemy, who still had a total of about 25,000 men «<£>riv es ,» 
in the field. But the blockhouses had already begun 
to serve the purpose for which they were designed. In the past 
the mobile columns, of which there were over sixty in the field, 
had always been bound to the railway for supply; now convoys 
could be pushed out to them along whatever blockhouse line they 
touched. In January Bruce Hamilton continued his successful 
night marches, and late in the month General Ben Viljoen was 
captured in the Leydenburg district. The only set-back was the 
descent which Beyers made upon Pietersburg, breaking into the 
concentration camp and carrying off a number of able-bodied 
refugees. Early in February Lord Kitchener commenced his 
first drive, and it was so successful that it was evident that the 
key to the situation had been found. First the country east of 
the line Bloemfontein-Vereeniging was swept four times over, 
then the method was employed in the Transvaal, east and west, 
and finally against the Cape rebels. There were a few small 
reverses, of which De la Rey's successful rush upon Paris's column 
and capture of Lord Methuen was the most important, but when 
some initial mistakes in the composition of the driving lines, 
which robbed the earlier drives of part qf their effect, were made 
good, the system worked like a machine. The Boers were at 
last convinced of the futility of any attempt to prolong the 
struggle, and on the 23rd of March the representatives of the 
Boer governments came into Pretoria. Six weeks were spent 
in negotiation, and then a meeting of delegates, under the 
presidency of General Kemp, was held at Vereeniging.

of all burghers in the field, with all arms and 
munitions of war; (2) all burghers duly declaring themselves 
subjects of King Edward VII. to be repatriated; (3) no 
burghers who should surrender to be deprived of either their 
liberty or property; (4) no proceedings to be taken against 
burghers for any legitimate acts of war during the period of

being given as compensation for the destruction of farms. 

In the whole war the British lost 5774 killed and 22,829 wounded, 
while the Boers lost about 4000 killed. The number of Boer prisoners 
in the hands of the British at the end of the war was about 
40,000. (L.J.*; C.F.A.) 

F. From the Annexation to iqii. — On the 4th of July 1900, 
a month after the occupation of Pretoria, a commission was 
issued to Lord Roberts authorizing him to annex the Transvaal. 
The proclamation of annexation was dated the 1st of September. 
Lord Roberts held the post of administrator of the colony 
until his departure for England in December following, when 
he was succeeded by Sir Alfred Milner, the high commissioner. 
It was not, however, until March 1901 that Milner, who resigned 
his governorship of Cape Colony, arrived at Pretoria to in- 
augurate a civil administration. 1 Hostilities were still pro- 
ceeding, but in the areas under control Lord Milner (who was 
raised to the peerage in May) speedily set the machinery of 
government in motion. The civil administration of justice 
began in April; in October a reformed judicial system, with 
Sir J. Rose Innes as chief justice, was put into operation; in 
1902 this was followed by the establishment of a supreme 
court. Besides law, the important departments of finance 
and mines were organized, and steps taken to remedy the 
grievances of the commercial and mining classes. Sir David 
Barbour, who had presided over a commission to inquire into 
the concessions granted by the late republic, presented a 
valuable report in June, and suggested a tax of 10 % on the 
profits of the gold mining industry, a suggestion carried out 
a year later (June 1902). Meantime Johannesburg had been 
given a town council, and some of the gold mines permitted to 
restart crushing (May 1901). In November of 1901 the main 
body of the Uitlanders were allowed to return to the Rand. 
The Work of They na d fled the country immediately before 
Reconstruct the outbreak of war and had been living at the 
iIoa * seaports. While thus caring for the urban areas 

the administration was equally alive to the needs of the country 
districts. A commission which had been appointed to inquire 
into schemes of land settlement reported in June, and this was 
followed *by the creation of a land board in- December 1901. 
Lord Milner cherished the ideal of racial fusion by the establish- 
ment of British settlers on a large scale. He also recognized 
the necessity, if agriculture was to be developed, of an extensive 
system of irrigation, and Sir William Willcocks, formerly of the 
Egyptian Irrigation Department, was engaged to draw up a com- 
prehensive scheme, having in view also the needs of the gold mines. 
Another department taken in hand was that of education; and 
the success which attended the opening of schools in the refugee 
camps was most striking. At the time the articles of peace 
were signed at Pretoria, more than 17,000 Boer children were

being educated in these camps under the supervision 01' Mr 
E. B. Sargant. 

This work of reconstruction was carried out in face of many 
difficulties other than those inherent to the undertaking. More 
than one plot on the part of Boers who had taken the oath of 
allegiance was hatched in Johannesburg, the most serious, 
perhaps, being that of Brocksma, formerly third public prose- 
cutor under the republic. On the 15th of September 1901 
Brocksma and several others were arrested as spies and con- 
spirators. Letters to Dr Leyds and to Dr Krause of a treason- 
able character were found in Brocksma's possession, and being 
found guilty of high treason he was shot (30th of September). 
Krause, who was then in London, was arrested, tried and 
convicted for attempting to incite to murder, and sentenced to 
imprisonment. In November another conspiracy, to seize 
Johannesburg with the help of General Dela Rey,was discovered 
and frustrated. More injurious than plots of this nature was 
the political agitation carried on in Cape Colony and in Great 
Britain. This agitation was directed with particular virulence 
against the high commissioner, whose recall, it was asserted, 
would remove the chief obstacle to peace. Mr J. X. Merriman 
and Mr J. W. Sauer came to England in the summer of 1901 
on a mission from the Cape Africanders, and received much 
encouragement from Radical politicians. Nevertheless, much 
had been done to establish order and restart commerce by the 
time peace was made. 

After the signature of the articles of peace the work of recon- 
struction was accelerated. The end of the military government 
was signalled by the assumption (on the 21st of June) by Lord 
Milner of the title of governor of the Transvaal and by the 
creation of an executive council. The Boer leaders unreservedly 
accepted British sovereignty. Generals Botha, De Wet and 
De la Rey, however, paid a visit to England (August-September, 
1902) in an unsuccessful endeavour to get the terms of peace 
modified in their favour; they received little encouragement 
from a tour they made on the continent of Europe. On their 
return to South Africa the Boer generals and their colleagues 
aided to some extent in the work of resettlement, but the seats 
offered to the Boers on the executive council were declined. 
The work of repatriation and resettlement was carried out by 
commissioners acting in conjunction with a central advisory 
committee at Pretoria. These supplied the people with food, 
shelter, stock and implements. The burgher and native con- 
centration camps were rapidly broken up; by December 1902 
only 7600 out of 70,000 were left in the burgher camps. 

At this period Mr Chamberlain determined to visit South 
Africa and use his personal influence to help forward the settle- 
ment of the country. After the almost total cessation of 
commerce during the war, there was in the last half of 1902 and 
the beginning of 1903 a great impetus to trade. When Mr 
Chamberlain reached the Transvaal in January 1903 the feeling 
among the British section of the community was optimistic. 
Mr Chamberlain was well received by the Boer leaders; it was, 
however, to the Rand magnates that he turned for financial help. 
That large sums were imperatively needed to accomplish the 
work of reconstruction was apparent. An agreement was 
reached whereby a loan of £35,000,000, guaranteed by the 
imperial government, was to be raised for the benefit of the 
Transvaal and the Orange River Colony; a further loan of 
£30,000,000 was to be issued in instalments of £10,000,000 and 
paid into the British exchequer as the Transvaal's contribution 
towards the cost of the war. The first instalment of this loan, 
to be issued in 1904, was guaranteed by the great mining firms 
of Johannesburg. With the proceeds of the first loan the debt 
of the South African Republic was paid off, the Transvaal and 
the Orange River Colony railways were bought by the state, 
and new railways and other public works were undertaken. The 
£3,000,000 granted by the articles of peace, and other consider- 
able sums, besides £7,000,000 from the loan, were expended on 
repatriation and compensation. 

The efforts made by the administration to restore the Boers 
to the land, to develop the material resources of the country,

and to remove all barriers to the intellectual and moral develop- 
ment of the people, were soon, however, hampered by severe 

c - commercial depression. One of the least results of 

Economic . . *? 

Depression this depression was that the second war loan 
and Chinese arranged by Mr Charnberlain was never issued, 
Labour. Great Britain finally (in 1906) abandoning all her 
claims. The commercial depression was due to many causes; 
of these the most apparent was the shortage of labour at the Rand 
mines. When work restarted after the war, the mine owners 
offered the Kaffir workmen little more than half the wages paid in 
1898; but this effort at economy was abandoned, and the old rates 
of pay were restored in January 1903. Nevertheless, the labour 
available continued to be very much below the needs of the 
mines. The consequent small gold output meant a serious 
decrease of revenue, which was not compensated for by the heavy 
tax levied on the output of the Premier diamond mine, where 
operations began in 1903. Finally, to enable them to work 
their mines to their full capacity, the Rand houses asked for 
leave to import Chinese labourers. 1 Milner, anxious above 
everything else to obtain sufficient revenue to carry on his work 
of reconstruction, gave his consent to the experiment. The 
home government concurred, and during 1904-1906 over 
50,000 Chinese were brought to the Rand on three-years' in- 
dentures. The objections to the introduction of the Chinese, 
urged in South Africa, in Great Britain and in other parts 
of the British Empire, are discussed under South Africa: 
History, § D. ; here it need only be added that in the Transvaal 
the point upon which all parties were agreed was that no new 
racial or economic complications should be permitted; and 
these were guarded against by the restriction of the coolies to 
unskilled lahour in the gold mines and by their compulsory 
repatriation. By the introduction of the Chinese the gold 
output from the mines was greatly increased, with the result 
that the Transvaal suffered less than any other part of South 
Africa from the restriction of commerce, which lasted for 
several years. 

The discussions in the legislative council on the Chinese coolie 
question had been accompanied by a demand on the part of the 
Boers that such an important step should not be taken " without 
the constitutional approval of the white people of the Trans- 
vaal"; and after the importation of the coolies had begun, the 
agitation for the grant of representative institutions grew in 
volume. The British government was also of opinion that the 
time was near for the setting up of such institutions, and the 
pending grant of a constitution to the Transvaal was announced 
in parliament in July 1904. Meantime the existing (nominated) 
legislative council was dealing with another and a vital phase 
of the Asiatic question. There were in the Transvaal some 
10,000 British Indians, whose right to " enter, travel or reside " 
in the country was secured by the London convention of 1884. 
Under republican rule these Indians — who were mainly small 
shopkeepers, but included some professional men of high stand- 
ing — had suffered many restrictions, and their cause had been

European inhabitants of the Transvaal further to restrict their 
privileges and at the same time to stop the immigration of 
other Indians. In this matter the Boer and British sections 
of the community were in agreement, and they had the support 
of the Transvaal government and of the other South African 
colonies. The problem was both economic and racial, and 
on both grounds South Africans showed a determination 
to exclude the competition of Indians and other Asiatics. 
Mr Alfred Lyttelton (who had succeeded Mr Chamberlain as 
secretary of state for the colonies) endeavoured to meet the 
wishes of the Transvaal by sanctioning legislation which would 
greatly restrict the immigration of Indians, but he would allow

no tampering with the rights of Indians already in the colony. 
In 1907 the royal assent was given to bills restricting the 
immigration of Asiatics and providing for the registration 
of all Asiatics in the country. 

In accordance with the promise made in 1904 a constitution 
for the Transvaal on representative lines was promulgated by 
letters patent on the 31st of March 1905; but there seif-Qovern- 
was already an agitation for the immediate grant ment—the 
of full self-government, and on the accession to Botha 
office of the Campbell-Bannerman administration Mtnlstr y* 
in December 1905 it was decided to accede to it. New letters 
patent 2 were issued (December 12, 1906), and the first 
general election (February 1907) resulted in the return of a 
majority belonging to Hel Volk, a Boer organization formed 
for political purposes. (See further, South Africa: History, 
§ D.) ^ Sir Richard Solomon, 3 it was thought, might have formed 
a coalition cabinet, but he was among the defeated candidates. 
Lord Selborne, who had during 1905 succeeded Lord Milner 
as high commissioner and governor of the Transvaal, en- 
trusted General Botha with the formation of a ministry. Botha 
chose as his colleagues Messrs J. C. Smuts (colonial secretary), 
Jacob de Villiers (attorney-general), H. C. Hull (colonial trea- 
surer), J. F. B. Rissik (minister of lands and native affairs) and 
E. P. Solomon (minister of public works). These were all men 
of progressive, in some respects democratic, views, and in thus 
forming his cabinet General Botha showed his determination 
not to be dominated by the " back veld " Boers. Botha was 
strengthened in his attitude by the firm action of the Progressive 
(i.e. the ex-Uitlander) party, which secured 21 seats (out of a 
total of 69) in the legislative chamber, entirely in the Rand and 
Pretoria districts, and was led by Sir George Farrar and Sir 
Percy Fitzpatrick. 4 The government, which obtained an im- 
perial guarantee for a loan of £5,000,000, announced that 
while there would be no wholesale repatriation of Chinese, the 
labour ordinance under which they were recruited would not be 
renewed, and by February 1910 all the Chinese coolies had 
returned home. At the same time successful efforts were made 
by the ministry to increase the supply of Kaffir labour for the 
mines. In the re-establishment of the field cornets and in 
other directions a return was made to the republican forms of 
administration, and on the education question an agreement 
satisfactory to both the British and Dutch-speaking com- 
munities was reached. Ample facilities were given for the 
teaching of Dutch, but it was provided that no pupil should 
be promoted to a higher standard unless he (or she) was making 
satisfactory progress in the knowledge of English. 

One of the first problems which confronted the Botha ministry 
was the attitude to be adopted towards the other British colonies 
in South Africa. Lord Milner, by the creation of 
an inter-colonial board — which administered the Movement 
railways of the Transvaal and Orange River Colony 
and controlled the constabulary of both colonies — and in other 
ways (e.g. the inclusion of the Transvaal in the South Africa 
customs union), had endeavoured to pave the way for federation. 
Mr Chamberlain when in South Africa in 1903 had also put 
forward federation as the desired goal. The existence of the 
inter-colonial council hampered, however, the freedom of the 
Transvaal government, and steps were taken to determine it. 

2 The letters patent provided, as to the Chinese coolies, that 
no further licences be issued for the introduction of indentured 
labour, and that none of the contracts be renewed. 

3 Sir Richard Solomon (b. 1850) was attorney-general of Cape 
Colony 1898-1900, attorney-general of the Transvaal 1902, and 
acting lieutenant-governor of the Transvaal 1905. He resigned office 
to contest a seat for the Transvaal parliament. Subsequently 
he was agent-general for the Transvaal in London, and (1910) agent- 
general for the Union of South Africa. , 

4 Sir George Herbert Farrar (b. 1859) was a son of Charles Farrar, 
M.D., of Chatteris, England, and was a member of the Johannesburg 
Reform committee at the time of the Jameson Raid. He served 
in the war of 1899-1902, and was knighted in the last-named year. 
Sir James Percy Fitzpatrick (b. 1862) was a native of Cape Colony. 
He went to the Transvaal in 1884 and became honorary secretary 
to the Johannesburg Reform committee. He was the author of 
The Transvaal from Within; Jock of the Bushveld, &c.

Nevertheless, on economic as well as political grounds, the leaders 
of both parties in the Transvaal were prepared to consider 
favourably the proposals put forward by Dr Jameson at the close 
of 1906 for a closer union of all the self-governing colonies, and 
the first direct step to that end was taken at an inter-colonial 
conference held in May 1908. The history of this movement, 
which resulted in the establishment of the Union of South 
Africa on the 31st of May 1910, is given under South Africa: 
History, § D. Apart from this movement the most notable 
events in the Transvaal at this period were the development 
of agriculture, 1 the gradual revival of trade (the output of the 
gold mines in 1909 totalled £30,925,000, and at the end of the 
year 156,000 native- labourers were employed), and the con- 
tinued difficulty with regard to British Indians. Ministers 
declared their determination to keep the Transvaal a white 
man's country. With the example of Natal before them as a 
warning, it was (they argued) to the whites a question of life 
and death, and unless registration were enforced they could 
not prevent the surreptitious entry of new-comers. Attempts 
at compromise made in 1908 ended in failure. For failing to 
register Mr M. V. Gandhi and other leaders were imprisoned; 
and large numbers of Indians were deported. Notwithstanding 
the remonstrances of the Indian government, the imperial 
authorities could not effectively intervene; a self-governing 
colony (in which whites alone possessed the franchise) must 
be allowed to take its own course. By the end of 1909 it was 
stated that 8000 Indians — most of whom claimed the right of 
domicile — had been compelled to leave the country, while 2500 
had been imprisoned for failure to comply with tbe Registration 
Act. The establishment of the Union of South Africa removed 
from the competence of the Transvaal provincial council all 
legislation specially or differentially affecting Asiatics. There- 
upon the Union ministry was urged by the British govern- 
ment to effect a permanent settlement acceptable to all parties. 
The ministry replied (July 23, 1910) that whatever policy 
might be adopted regarding Indians legitimately resident in 
South Africa, unrestricted Indian immigration into the Trans- 
vaal would not be permitted (see Blue-book Cd. 5363). 

When the Union was established General Botha became 
prime minister, two of his colleagues, Messrs Smuts and Hull, 
also joining the Union ministry. A fourth minister — Mr 
Rissik — was appointed first administrator of the Transvaal 
province, while a fifth minister, Mr E. P. Solomon, became a 
senator of the Union parliament. The elections to the Union 
House of Assembly, held in September, were notable as 
showing the strength of the Progressive (or Unionist) party. 
General Botha was defeated at Pretoria East by Sir Percy 
Fitzpatrick, and at Georgetown — a Rand constituency — 
Mr Hull was beaten by Sir George Farrar. Both ministers, 
however, subsequently secured seats elsewhere.

TRANSVERSE RIB (Fr. arc doubleau), the term in archi- 
tecture given to the rib of a vault which is carried across the nave, 
dividing the same into bays. Although as a rule it was sunk 
in the barrel vault of the Thermae, it is found occasionally 
below it, as in the Piscina at Baiae and the so-called Baths of 
Diana (Nymphaeum) at Nimes. In the Romanesque and Gothic 
styles it becomes the principal feature of the vault, so much so 
that Scott termed it the master rib (see Vault). 

TRANSYLVANIA 2 (Lat. Trans silvania; Ger. Siebenburgen; 
Hung. Erdely; Rumanian, Ardeal), a former principality 
(Grossfurstentum) occupying the extreme eastern portion of the 
kingdom of Hungary. It is bounded by Hungary proper on 
the W. and N., by Bukovina on the N.E. and by Rumania 
on the E. and S., and has an area of about 21,000 sq. m. 

Transylvania has the form of an irregular circle, and is a high 
plateau of a mean altitude of 1000-1600 ft. above sea-level, sur- 
rounded on all sides by mountains. These are known under the 
general name of Transylvanian Mountains (q.v.), which are the south- 
eastern continuation of the Carpathian system, and fill the interior 
of the country with their ramifications. On the west or Hungarian 
side there are comparatively easy passes into the interior, but on 
the east and south frontiers the lofty mountains give Transylvania 
the aspect of a huge natural fortress. Among the highest peaks 
are Negoi (8345 ft.), Bucsecs (8230 ft.), Pietrosu (7544 ft.) and 
Konigstein (7352 ft.). There are^ numerous valleys, ravines and 
canons in the network of mountains covering the interior of the 
country. The principal plains are: in the valley of the Szamos 
near Dds and Besztereze (Bistritz); in the middle course of the 
Maros the beautiful Hatszeg valley; the fertile Cibin valley around 
Nagy-Szeben; the valley of the Aluta near Csik-Szereda, and the 
one extending from Reps to theRoteturm pass; and lastly the 
beautiful and fertile Burzenland in the vicinity of Brass6. The 
altitude of the valleys generally increases towards the east of Tran- 
sylvania, the lowest depression being found in the western part of the 
Maros valley. Almost in the centre of the country lies a fertile 
plain about 60 m. in length and 50 m, in breadth, called Mezoseg or 



2 The Latin name appears first after the 12th century, and signifies 
"beyond the woods, i.e. from Hungary; the Hungarian and 
Rumanian name both mean "forest land." The German name 
is usually derived from the seven principal fortified towns or 
11 burgs,*' founded^ by the German colonists, though some authorities 
prefer to connect it with the Cibin Mountains on the south frontier.

the Transylvania plain. The principal rivers of Transylvania, which 
are cither tributaries of the Theiss, or flow direct into the Danube, 
are: the Maros, which rises in the mountains forming the eastern 
wall of Transylvania, and taking first a northern course flows through 
the country from east to west; its principal affluents are the Gorgeny, 
the Great and Little Kokel or Nagy and Kis Kukullo, the Strell 
(Sztrigi) and the Cserna on the left, and on the right the Ampoly and 
the Aranyos, which is rich in auriferous sediments. The Aluta (Alt 
or CXt) rises not far from the Maros, but takes a southerly direction 
and pierces the Carpathians at the Roteturm pass, to enter Rumania; 
its principal tributaries in Transylvania are the Vargyas, the 
Homorod, the Cibin and the Burzen. The Szamos, formed by the 
junction of the Great (Nagy) and Little (Kis) Szamos, whose 
principal affluent is the Bistritz; the Zsil or Jiul; and the White 
and the Swift Koros are the other principal rivers. The largest lake 
of Transylvania is the Czeger or Hodosser Sec, 13 m. long, situated 
near Szamos- Ujvar, while a great number of small but beautiful 
mountain lakes are found. The climate of Transylvania is healthy; 
hot summers alternate with very cold winters, but the rainfall is 
not great. Transylvania abounds in mineral springs of all kinds, 
especially saline and chalybeate, the principal ones being found 
at Borszek, Elopatak, Homorod, Rodna, Tusnad and Zaizon. 

The principal occupations of the inhabitants are agriculture, 
cattle-rearing and mining. Of the total area of Transylvania 22*6% 
is arable land; 16-5% meadows and gardens; 9-5% pastures and 
0-5% vineyards; while 37*3% is covered by forests and 13;5% 
is unproductive soil. The vegetation of Transylvania is luxuriant, 
except of course in the higher mountain zones. Fruits abound, as 
apples, pears, peaches, apricots, plums, cherries, chestnuts and 
almonds; mulberries are also cultivated. The vine flourishes best 
in the valley of the Maros. The chief crop is maize; but wheat, rye 
and other grains, potatoes, saffron, hemp, flax and tobacco are also 
grown. On the boundary mountains the trees are mainly coniferous; 
in the interior oaks, elms, beeches and ashes are conspicuous. 

Bears, wolves, foxes, boars and various varieties of game are 
found, and on some of the mountains the chamois. There is abun- 
dant pasturage on which excellent cattle are reared ; and in some 
districts buffaloes are bred for draught purposes. More important 
is the breeding of a sturdy race of horses, thousands of which are 
annually exported. The mountains maintain large flocks of sheep, 
of which two kinds are distinguished — with a fine short-stapled 
and a coarse long-stapled wool respectively. Silkworms arc bred, 
and some silk is spun; and the export of honey and waxis not 
inconsiderable. Transylvania possesses the richest gold mines in 
Europe, and this metal is also "washed" in some of the streams, 
chiefly by gipsies. The gold is often found in conjunction with 
tellurium (first discovered in Transylvania in 1782) and is extracted 
principally at Nagyag, Kapnik-Banya, Zalatna and Vorospatak. 
In 1900 the value of the gold extracted was £300,000. Silver, 
copper, lead and iron arc worked to some profit, while arsenic, alum, 
graphite, marble, porcelain, precious and building stones arc also 
Found. Coal is mined in the valley of the Zsil, but the abundance 
of timber has retarded its exploitation. Some of the saline springs 
yield salt enough to render their evaporation profitable. The 
principal places where salt is extracted are at Maros-Uivar, DeV 
Akna, Kolozs, Torda and Vizakna. In 1900 the value of the mineral 
products, except salt, was £1,000,000. 

The industry of Transylvania, although not very developed, 
made some progress during the last quarter of the 19th century, 
and is mostly in the hands of the " Saxons." The principal branches 
are brewing, distilling, flour-milling, sugar, leather, paper, petroleum- 
refineries, cloth and earthenwares. The production of linen from 
flax and hemp is a home industry throughout Transylvania. The 
commerce is fairly active, and is mainly in cattle, dairy products, 
wood and wooden articles, and petroleum. 

The population in 1900 numbered 2,456,838. Until 1848 the 
chief influence and privileges, as well as the only political rights, 
were divided among the three " privileged nations " of the 
Hungarians, Szeklers and Saxons. The first are the descendants 
of the Magyar conquerors. The Szeklers are of disputed 
origin, but closely akin to the Magyars (see Szeklers). 
The Saxons are the posterity of the German immi- 
grants brought by King Geza II. (1141-1161) from Flanders 
and the lower Rhine to cultivate and repeople his desolated 
territories. At first these were known as Teutones, Teutonici 
Hospites and Flandrenses, but since the beginning of the 13th 
century the general name of " Saxons," as tantamount to " Ger- 
mans," has prevailed. They are generally the most advanced 
section of the population. Their literary language is High 
German, but their spoken language is more of the Low German 
character. The Hungarians and Szeklers together number 
814,994, and the Saxons 233,019, but by far the most numerous 
% element, though long excluded from power and political equality, 
is formed by the Rumanians, 1,397,282 in number, who are 



spread all over the country. The gipsies of Transylvania, who 
are heard of under a voivode or prince of their own in 1417, 
are estimated at 50,000; many of them have taken to agriculture 
or gold-washing. Jews, Armenians, Bulgarians, Ruthenians 
and Greeks are also represented in the medley of peoples. The 
Magyars are mostly Roman Catholics or Unitarians, the Germans 
Protestants, and the Rumanians adherents of the Greek Church- 
Transylvania, which was completely incorporated with Hun- 
gary in 1868, forms since 1876 one of the seven large adminis- 
trative divisions into which Hungary was divided in that 
year. It was* subdivided into fifteen countries, and contains 
the following principal towns : Kolozsvar, Brass6, Nagy- 
Szeben, Maros- Vasarhely, Besztercze, Fogaras, Torda, Segesvar, 
Gyula-Fehcrvar, Des, Szamos-Ujv&r. 

History. — Transylvania formed part of the Roman province 
of Dacia. After the withdrawal of the Romans the country 
became for centuries the prey of the various peoples who swept 
across it in their restless migrations. At the beginning of the 1 ith 
century (1004) Stephen I. of Hungary made himself master 
of the land, which was thenceforward governed as a Hungarian 
province by a voivode. As mentioned above, King Geza II. 
introduced German colonists, who founded Nagy-Szeben (Her- 
mannstadt), and in 1211 King Andreas II. called in the German 
Teutonic orders, who settled in the Burzenland. These 
German colonists were granted special privileges, and founded 
many of the Transylvanian towns. As by the death of King 
Louis II. in 1526 the Hungarian crown fell to the house of 
Austria, the voivode John Zapolya succeeded in rendering him- 
self independent. He and his successors, who were generally 
elected by the people, were supported by the Turks against the 
House of Austria, while the difficult nature of their country pre- 
served them on the other hand from becoming too dependent on 
their powerful allies. After the defeat of the Turks at Vienna in 
1683, their influence in Transylvania waned, and in 1699, by 
the peace of Carlowitz, the Porte acknowledged the suzerainty 
of Leopold I. of Austria over Transylvania. By the Leo- 
poldine diploma of 1691 Leopold had guaranteed the ancient 
rights and laws of the land, and united it formally with the 
Hungarian crown. In 1765 Maria Theresa made it a grand 
principality (Grossfiirstentum). The efforts of the Rumanian 
inhabitants to secure recognition as a fourth " nation," and the 
opposition of the non-Magyar population to a closer union with 
Hungary, led to troubles early in the 19th century, culminating 
in 1848. In 1849 Transylvania was divided from Hungary by 
an imperial decree, and became an Austrian crown-land; but 
in 1S60. Transylvania became an autonomous province, with a 
separate Diet, and a high executive power of its own. The Diet 
assembled in Nagy-Szcben in 1863 decreed the complete separa- 
tion from Hungary, the union with Austria, and the recognition 
of the Rumanians as the " fourth nation." But the Hungarian 
government did not recognize this Diet, and the Diet assembled 
at Kolozsvar in 1865, in which the Hungarians had the majority, 
decreed again the union with Hungary. By the compromise 
of 1867 Austria granted the union of Transylvania with Hungary, 
which was completed in 1868. Transylvania lost every vestige 
of autonomy, and was fully and completely incorporated with 
Hungary. Since that time the Magyarization of the principality 
has steadily been carried through, in spite of the bitter protests 
and discontent of both the Saxons and Rumanians. A 
Hungarian university was founded at Kolozsvar in 1872; and 
Hungarian is recognized as the official language.

TRANSYLVANIAN MOUNTAINS, the general, name of the 
mountain system which surTounds the Transylvanian highland 
or plateau on all four sides, and forms the south-eastern and 
southern continuation of the Carpathian system (q.v.). At 
the mouths of the Viso and the Golden Bistritza, where the 



212 



TRAP 



Eastern or Wooded Carpathians end, the range of mountains 
divides and sends ramifications in two directions, .to the south 
and to the west. These chains which enclose Transylvania, 
giving it the general aspect- of a great natural fortress, are the 
most eastern offshoots of the mountain system of central Europe, 
and guard the approach from the east to the great Hungarian 
plain. They slope gently towards the interior of Transylvania, 
but rather abruptly towards Rumania, and while the western 
wall possesses several large and easy passes, the eastern and 
southern walls are much more difficult to cross. 

The eastern wall of the Transylvania^ quadrilateral is composed 
of two parallel ranges of mountains divided by the valleys of the 
Maros and Aluta. The outer range is composed of the following 
groups: the Gyergy6 Mountains (including the Kelemen range) with 
the highest peaks Kelemcnhavas (6600 ft.) and Pietrosul (6908 
ft); the Csik Mountains with the highest peaks Nagy-Hagymas 
(5900 ft.) and the volcanic Budos (3300 ft.) ; and the Bereczk Moun- 
tains with the highest peak Lakocza (5830 ft.). The inner range 
is composed of the following groups: the G6rg6ny Mountains with 
the highest peak Mezdhavas (5826 ft.) ; the Hargitta Mountains with 
the highest peak Hargitta (5900 ft.); and the Barota Mountains 
with the highest peak Kukukhcgy (5120 ft.). Near the mouths of 
the Maros and the Aluta are situated the celebrated Gyorgyo valley, 
one of the most beautiful in the whole Transylvania, and the famous 
Borsz6k valley with its mineral springs.^ 

The southern wall of the Transylvanian highland is occupied by 
the Transylvanian Alps. They have a length of 230 m., and are 
the highest and wildest mountain range of the whole Transylvanian 
system, resembling the High Tatra in their bold and high peaks, 
their beautiful scenery, and their flora. The Transylvanian Alps 
rise to an altitude of 7200 fo above the level of the Danubian 
(Rumanian) plain, and are divided into a considerable number of 
groups. From east to west these groups are: the Bodza Mountains 
with the highest peak Csukas (Ciucas, 6424 ft.); the Burzenland 
Mountains with the beautiful peaks of Buesecs (8230 ft.), Konig- 
stein (7352 ft.) and Schuler (5910 ft.); the high Forgaras group, 
extending to the Roteturm pass, and containing Negoi (8345 ft.), 
the highest peak in the Transylvanian mountains, Butyan (8230 ft.) 
and Surul (7482 ft.). West of the Roteturm pass the Transylvanian 
Alps are also known under the name of the Hatszeg Mountains, and 
consist of the following groups: the Cibin Mountains with the highest 
peak Cindrel (7366 ft.) ; the Paringul Mountains with the highest 
peak Mandra (8260 ft.); the Vulkan Mountains, and the Hatszeg 
Mountains proper with the beautiful peak Retiezat (8125 ft.). 
The south-western part of the Transylvanian Alps is formed by the 
Cserna or Ruszka Mountains with the highest peak Verfu Petri 
(8140 ft.) whose offshoots, of a mean altitude of 3200-4700, known as 
the Banat Mountains, fill the Banat. The southern part of the 
Cserna Mountains, known as the Stretinye Mountains, extend to the 
Danube, and together with the Mirocn Mountains, on the right 
side of the Danube, and belonging, therefore, to the Balkan system, 
form the famous gorge of the Iron Gate near Orsova. 

The western and northern wall of the Transylvanian quadrilateral 
do not present the character of an uninterrupted chain 01 mountains, 
but possess many low and easy passes towards the Hungarian 
plain. Going from south to north the principal groups are: the 
Transylvanian Ore Mountains with the basaltic mass of the Detunata 
(3768 ft.) near Abrudbanya; the Bihar Mountains, with romantic 
scenery and numerous caverns, with the highest peak the Cucurbeta 
(6045 ft.) ; to the east of this group are the Aranyos Mountains with 
the highest peak, the Muntelui Mare (5970 ft.), to the south-west of 
Kolozsvar; then come the Meszes group and the Kraszna Moun- 
tains. The northern wall is formed by the Lapos Mountains with 
the highest peak Ciblesiu (6020 ft.), and the Rodna Mountains with 
the highest peaks Muncsel (5835 ft.), Pictrosu (7544 ft.) and Ineu 
(7484 ft.). 

Inside this mountainous quadrilateral lies the Transylvanian 
highland or plateau, which has a mean elevation of 1000-1600 ft. 
It is improperly called a plateau, for it does not possess anywhere 
extensive plains, but is formed of a network of valleys of various 
sizes, ravines and canons, united together by numerous small moun- 
tain ranges, which usually attain a height of 500-800 ft. above the 
altitude of the valley. 

In the Transylvanian Mountains the principal passes are: the 
Rodna, the Borgo, the Tolgyes and the B6kas. Then come the 
Gyimes, the Uz and Oitoz, the Bodza or Buzeu, the Tomos or Predcal 
pass, crossed by the railway from Brasso to Bucharest, the famous 
Roteturm pass (1115 ft.) through the narrow gorge of the Aluta, 
crossed by the railway from Nagy-Szeben to Bucharest, the Vulkan, 
the Teregova pass, and the Iron Gate pass, both crossed by the 
railway from Temesvar to Craiova. All those passes lead from 
Transylvania into Rumania. From Transylvania into Hungary 
are the Banffy-Hunyad pass, crossed by the railway from Nagy- 
V&rad to Kolozsvar, and the defile of the Maros crossed by the 
railway from Arad to Broos. In the interior of Transylvania are 
the Szent-Domokos pass near Csik-Szcreda leading from the valley 



of the Aluta to that of the Maros (near their respective mouths), 
and the pass of Csik-Szereda over the Hargitta Mountains. 

TRAP (O. Eng. treppe or traeppe, properly a step, as that on 
which an animal places its foot and is caught, cf. Ger. Treppe, 
flight of stairs), a mechanical device for the snaring or catching 
anything, and especially wild animals. Traps for animals 
are of great antiquity, and no savage people has ever been 
discovered, whatever its culture scale, that did not possess 
some variety of snare. In the most primitive form of trap 
no mechanism need be present, e.g. a cavity into which the 
animal walks, as the pitfall of the Arabs and Africans or the 
snow-hole of the Eskimos. Dr O. T. Mason has divided traps 
into three classes: enclosing traps, which imprison the victim 
without injury; arresting traps, which seize the victim without 
killing it, unless it be caught by the neck or round the lungs; 
and killing traps, which crush, pierce or cut to death. 

Enclosing traps include the pen, cage, pit and door-traps. Pen- 
traps are represented by the fences built in Africa into which ante- 
lopes and other animals are driven ; and by fish-seines and pound- 
nets. Among cage-traps may be mentioned bird-cones filled with 
corn and smeared with bird-fime, which adhere to the bird's head, 
blinding it and rendering its capture^ easy; the fish-trap and 
lobster-pot; and the coop-traps, of which the turkey-trap is an 
example. This consists of a roofed diteh ending in a cul-de-sac 
into which the bird is led by a row of corn-kernels. Over the 
further end a kind of coop is built ; the bird, instead of endeavouring 
to retrace its steps, always seeks to escape upward and remains 
cooped. Pitfalls include not only those dug in the earth, at the 
bottom of which knives and^ spears are often fixed, but also several 
kinds of traps for small animals. One of these consists of a box 
near the top of which a platform is hung, insuch a way that, when the 
animal leaps upon it to secure the bait, it is precipitated into the 
bottom of the box, while the platform swings back into place. 
Another kind of pitfall is formed of a sort of funnel of long poles, 
into which birds fall upon alighting on a perfectly balaneed bar, 
to which a dish of corn is made fast. The door-traps form a large 
and varied class, ranging in size from the immense cage with sliding 
door in which such beasts as tigers are caught, to the common 
box-trap for mice or squirrels, the door of which falls when the 
spindle upon which *the bait is fixed is moved. The box-trap with 
a simple ratchet door, allowing the animal or bird to push under 
the door or wires which fall back and imprison them, is alike an 
enclosing and an arresting trap. There are four general classes of 
arresting traps, the mesh, the set-hook, the noose and the clutch. 
The mesh-traps include the mesh and thong toils used of old for the 
capture of the lion and other large game, and the gill-net in the 
meshes of which fish are caught by the gills. To the set-hook 
division are reckoned the set-lines of the angler, several kinds of 
trawls and the toggle or gorge attaehed to a line, whieh the animal, 
bird or fish swallows only to be held prisoner. The noose-trap class 
is a very extensive one. The simplest examples are the common 
slip-noose snares of twine, wire or horsehair, set for birds or small 
mammals either on their feeding grounds or runways, the victim 
being caught by the neck, body or foot as^ it tries to push through 
the noose. When the noose is used with bait it is generally attached 
to a stout sapling, which is bent over and kept^ from springing 
baek by some device of the " figure-4 " kind. This is constructed 
of three pieces of wood, one of the horizontal spindle on which the 
bait is placed, one of the upright driven into the ground, and the third 
the connecting cross-piece, fitted to the others so loosely that only the 
strain of the elastic sapling keeps the trap together. When the victim 
tries to secure the bait he dislodges the cross-piece and is caught 
by the noose, which is spread on the ground under the bait. The 
Patagonians take the vicuna with one variety of this snare, and, 
before the moose (Cervus alces) was protected by law in North America, 
even that animal, weighing often 1200 lb, was caught in snares 
of wire and rope. There are two widely different types of clutch- 
traps: bird-lime and other tenacious substances, and jaw and clap- 
traps. The simplest form of the first is adhesive fly-paper. A 
common practice in Italy is to smear with bird-lime the branches 
in the neighbourhood of a captive owl, which results in the capture 
of numbers of birds, gathered to scold at their common enemy. 
Examples of the clap-trap are the clap-net, consisting of two nets 
laid flat on the ground and attached to cords in such a manner that 
they fly up and close when the draw-eord is pulled by a concealed 
trapper; and the various other spring-traps used by bird-catchers. 
The jaw-traps are the most important class of device for the capture 
of fur-bearing animals, and are the product of civilization. While 
rude specimens are known to have existed in the middle ages, the 
steel-trap as used to-day dates from the middle of the 18th century, 
and reached perfection in the latter half of the 19th, the " New- 
house," named from the American inventor, having been the first 
trap of high grade. Steel-traps consist of two jaws, with or without 
teeth, which are worked by powerful single or double springs and , 
are " sprung " when the victim steps upon the " pan," which is 



TRAPANI— TRAPPISTS 



213 



placed between the jaws and attached to a lever. They are made 
in many sizes, from the smallest, designed for rats, to the " Great 
Bear Tamer/' weighing over 40 lb, with jaws of 16 in. in which 
lions, tigers and grizzly bears are trapped. The steel-trap is set and 
concealed in such a manner that the animal must step on its pan 
in passing over it to secure the bait. In trapping such wary animals 
as the sal>le, marten, mink, otter or beaver, great care is taken to 
obliterate all signs of the trap and of human presence, the scent of 
the hands being neutralized by smoking the traps or avoided by 
the use of gloves. In North America castoreum, musk, asafoetida, 
oil of anise and common fish-oil are used to entice the victims to the 
traps. Trails of some one of these scents are laid from different 
directions to the trap. 

With the clutch-traps must also be reckoned the oldest form of 
steel-trap, now to be seen only in museums, the man-trap, which 
was used first about the middle of the 1 8th century when the 
systematic preservation of game rendered protection against poachers 
a necessity. Such a trap, from Gloucestershire, is over 6 ft. 
long, has 19-in. serrated jaws and weighs 88 lb. Another form 
of man-trap, the spring-gun, belongs to the next category, the 
killing traps, which are divided into traps of weight, point and edge. 
The most important of the weight class is the dead-fall, of which 
the typical form consists of a pen over whose narrow entrance one 
or more logs are laid across a lighter log, which is balanced upon a 
spindle necessarily struck by the entering animal, causing the logs 
to fall upon its back. In some cases the bait is attached to the 
spindle itself. The dead-fall was always the favourite trap of the 
» American Indians, and is in use among many aboriginal tribes in 
Africa and South America. A slab of stone is often used as a weight. 
The common mouse-trap which kills either by a blow or strangulation 
is a variety of dead-fall. Of point-traps may be mentioned those 
of the impaling and the missile classes. An example of the former 
is the stake or spear placed by Arab and African tribes at the 
bottom of pitfalls for big game. Another impaling trap common in 
Africa is the harpoon down-fall, generally used for the hippopotamus. 
It consists of a heavily weighted harpoon suspended in such a way 
that the animal, passing beneath, breaks a cord and precipitates the 
harpoon upon itself. Another example of impalement is the hawk- 
trap, consisting of a circle of stout sharp wires, in the centre of which 
a live fowl is placed. A bird of prey attempting to secure the fowl 
is impaled upon the wires. Of missile traps the most universal 
are the ancient springbow and its modern representative^ the spring- 
gun. This is fixed upon stakes, or against a tree, with a line attached 
to the trigger and stretched immediately in front of the muzzle. 
An animal pressing against the string pulls the trigger and discharges 
the piece into its own body. An arrangement of sticks holding the 
bait in front of the muzzle is sometimes substituted for the string. 
Of edge-traps a curious example is the wolf- knife of Western America, 
which consists of a very sharp blade embedded in frozen fat. One 
of the wolves, licking the fat, cuts its tongue and a flow of blood 
ensues, with the result that not only the wolf itself but its com- 
panions become infuriated by the smell and taste, and the wounded 
beast, and often many of the others, are killed and devoured. The 
Alaskan knife-trap for large game consists of a heavy blade attached 
to a lever, which, when released by the animal biting at the bait, 
flies over and kills the victim.

TRAPANI (anc. Drepanutn), a city and episcopal see of 
Sicily, capital of the province of the same name, situated on 
the west coast, 3 m. W. of the Monte San Giuliano, which rises 
above it, 121 m. W. by S. of Palermo by rail, and 47 m. direct. 
Pop. (1906), town 47,578, commune 68,986. The ancient 
Drcpanum (dpeiravov, a sickle, from the shape of the low spit 
of land on which it stands) seems originally to have been the 
port of Eryx, and never to have been an independent city. 
It is represented by Virgil in the Aeneid as the scene of the death 
of Anchises, but first appears in history as an important Cartha- 
ginian naval station in the First Punic War (about 260 B.C.), 
part of the inhabitants of Eryx being transferred thither. Near 
Drepanum the Roman fleet was defeated in 250 B.C., while 
the struggle to obtain possession of it ended in the decisive 
Roman victory off the Aegates Islands in 241, which led to the 
conclusion of peace (see Punic Wars). It continued to be an 
important harbour, but never acquired municipal rights. Under 
the Norman kings, at the time of the first crusade, it became 
a place of importance; while it was a residence of the Aragonese 
kings. In the 16th and 17th centuries it was strongly fortified. 
In 1848 it was the first Sicilian city to rise against the Bourbons. 

No remains of the classical period exist except a portion 
of the mole. There are some fine Gothic and baroque palaces, 



and a few churches with interesting details. The Oratorio 
S. Michele contains wooden groups representing scenes from the 
Passion, executed in the 17th century and used for carrying 
in procession. On the tiled pavement of Sta Lucia is an 
interesting view of Trapani, showing the strong fortifications on 
the land side, which have been demolished to permit of the 
extension of the town in that direction. The Madonna dell* 
Annunziata, about i? m. east of the town, founded in 1332, is 
now restored to its original style. The adjacent Cappella del 
Cristo Risorto contains a statue of the Virgin and Child in 
marble said to have been brought from Cyprus, to which an 
immense number of valuable offerings have been made, among 
them two bronze candelabra and a model of the city in silver; 
while the statue itself is hung with jewels, necklaces, cameos, 
rings, watches, &c. The modern town is clean and well built, 
with a fine esplanade on the south. It is a harbour of considerable 
importance. It was entered by 144 vessels, representing a 
tonnage of 129,164 in 1906. The imports showed a value of 
£276,674, the most important items being wheat, coal and 
timber; while the exports amounted to £143,347, the chief items 
being salt, wine, salt fish and building-stone. There are also 
large salt-pans to the south of the city, extending along the coast 
as far as Marsala, which produce about 200,000 tons of salt 
annually, of which in 1906 121,192 tons were exported, chiefly to 
Norway, Sweden, Canada and the United States. The numerous 
windmills are used for grinding the salt. (T. As.) 

TRAP-BALL, or Knur and Spell (M. Eng. knurre, knot; Dan. 
spil, spindle), an old English game, which can be traced back to 
the beginning of the 14th century, and was commonly played in 
northern England as late as 1825, but has since been practically 
confined to children (bat, trap and ball). It was played with 
a wooden trap, by means of which a ball (knur) of hard 
wood about the size of a walnut was thrown into the air, where 
it was struck by the player with the " trip-stick," a bat con- 
sisting of two parts: the stick, which was of ash or lancewood 
and about 4 ft. long, and the pommel, a piece of very hard 
wood about 6 in. long, 4 in. wide and 1 in. thick. This was 
swung in both hands, although shorter bats for one hand 
were sometimes used. Originally the ball was thrown into 
the air by striking a lever upon which it rested in the trap; 
but in the later development of the game, usually called knur 
and spell, a spell or trap furnished with a spring was used, 
thus ensuring regularity in the height to which the knur was 
tossed. The object of the game was to strike the knur the 
greatest possible distance, either in one or a series of strokes. 

TRAPEZE, or Trapese, a form of swing, consisting of a cross- 
bar suspended by ropes and used for gymnastic exercises, 
acrobatic displays and the like. The name was so applied in 
French {trapbze) from the resemblance of the apparatus to a 
" trapezium " or irregular four-sided figure. The Greek Tpcwref iov 
is a diminutive of rp<brefa, a table, literally a four-footed or 
four-legged object, being a shortened form of Ttrpkir$ a (rerpa-, 
four, and 7refa, foot). 

TRAPEZOPHORON, the Greek term (from rpaTref a, table, and 
<t>eptw, to bear) given to the leg or pedestal of a small side table, 
generally in marble, and carved with winged lions or griffins 
set back to back, each with a single leg, which formed the 
support of the pedestal on either side. In Pompeii there was 
a fine example in the house of Cornelius Rufus, which stood 
behind the impluvium. These side tables were known as 
mensae vasariae and were used for the display of vases, lamps, 
&c. Sometimes they were supported on four legs, the example 
at Pompeii (of which the museums at Naples and Rome contain 
many varieties) had two supports only, one at each end of the 
table. The term is also applied to a single leg with lion's head, 
breast and forepaws, which formed the front support of a 
throne or chair. 

TRAPPISTS, Cistercian monks of the reform instituted 
by Armand J. le B. de Ranee (?.».), abbot of La Trappe, 
1664. La Trappe was a Cistercian abbey near Soligny, in 
the diocese of Sees, in Normandy, founded 1140. It suffered 
grievously from the English wars and from commendatory 



214 



TRAQUAIR— TRASIMENE, LAKE 



abbots, so that towards 1650 the community was reduced 
to half a dozen monks who had long ceased to comply 
with the obligations of their state, and were an open scandal 
to the neighbourhood. Armand Jean de Ranee became com- 
mendatory abbot at the age of ten, 1636; and on his con- 
version from a worldly life he began to interest himself in 
his abbey and conceived the project of restoring the monastic 
life therein, 1662. With this object he visited La Trappe, but 
the monks were recalcitrant and threatened his life; through 
the intervention of Louis XIV. he was able to pension them 
off; they were replaced by a community of Cistercians of the 
strict observance, and the monastic buildings, which had 
fallen into ruin, were repaired at de Ranee's expense. He 
himself then entered the novitiate in one of the reformed Cis- 
tercian abbeys, and on his profession he came to La Trappe 
as regular abbot, 1664. But he desired a return to the full 
programme of the primitive Cistercians. His influence with 
Louis XIV. and with the court of Rome secured him a free 
hand in carrying out changes without trammel from the Cis- 
tercian superiors, who looked askance at the project; and he 
was able to persuade his community to adopt a manner of life 
beyond the original Cistercian practice, and far beyond St 
Benedict's rule. Thus they abstained wholly from wine 
and fish, and rarely ate eggs; on certain days they had only 
bread and water, and on two days in the year they went 
barefooted; and they slept in their day clothes: these practices 
are in contradiction to what St Benedict allowed. On the 
other hand manual labour occupied only 3^ hours, but the 
church services 7 — herein reversing St Benedict's apportioning 
of the time. In short, the Trappist regime is probably the most 
penitential that has ever had any permanence in the Western 
Church. Yet it attracted vocations in such numbers that 
de Ranee had 300 monks under him. Through age and ill 
health he resigned his abbacy in 1695, and died five years 
later. 

During the 18th century La Trappe continued faithful to 
de Ranch's ideas, but the observance spread only into two 
monasteries in Italy. It was the dispersal of the com- 
munity at the French Revolution that turned the Trappists 
into a congregation in the Cistercian order and finally into 
a separate order. Dom Augustine de Lestrange, the novice- 
master at the time of the suppression in 1790, kept twenty 
of the monks together and obtained permission for them 
to settle at Val-Sainte in Fribourg, Switzerland. Here they 
made their life still stricter than that of La Trappe, and postu- 
lants flocked to them in such numbers that in two years' time 
colonies went forth to establish Trappist monasteries in England, 
Belgium, Piedmont, Spain and Canada; and in 1794 Dom 
Augustine was named by the Holy See Father Abbot of all 
these foundations, thus formed into a congregation. In 181 7 
they returned to La Trappe, many new foundations were made, 
and by Dom Augustine's death in 1827 there were in all some 
seven hundred Trappist monks. In the course of the century 
three or four congregations arose — a Belgian, an Italian, and 
two in France — each with a vicar subject to the general of the 
Cistercians. In 1892 these congregations were united into a 
single Order of Reformed Cistercians, or of Strict Observance, 
with an abbot-general resident in Rome and independent 
of the general of the Cistercians of the Common Observance. 
In 1898 the Trappists recovered possession of Citeaux, the 
mother-house of the Cistercians, secularized since the Revolu- 
tion, and it was declared by Rome to be the head and mother 
house of the Reformed Cistercians, who thus were recognized 
as the authentic representatives of the primitive Cistercian 
movement. 

The Trappists are a thriving and vigorous order. In 1905 
they had 58 monasteries with 1300 professed choir monks and 
1700 lay brothers. At the time of the recent expulsions (1903) 
they had twenty houses in France, and they have two or three 
in all the countries of western Europe, including England 
(Mount St Bernard, near Leicester) and Ireland (Mount 
Mellery in Waterford and Roscrea); also in the United States 



and in Canada. Besides they have a house in China, with over 
fifty Chinese monks; one each in Japan, Asia Minor, Palestine, 
Bosnia and Dalmatia, and four in various parts of Africa. 
The abbey of Mariannhill in Natal is devoted to the christian- 
izing and civilizing of the Kaffirs; there are numerous stations 
with elementary schools and chapels, and at the abbey is a 
high school and printing-press for books in the Zulu and 
Basuto languages. In heathen countries the Trappists now 
give themselves up to missionary work and the task of 
civilizing the natives. 

The first Trappist nunnery was the abbey of Les Clairet, 
near Chartres, which de Ranee persuaded to adopt his reforms. 
Dom Augustine de Lestrange established another in 1796, and 
now there are fifteen with 350 choir nuns and 500 lay sisters. 
One is in England at Stapehill, near Wimborne, founded in 
1802. The manner of life of the nuns is almost the same as 
that of the monks. 

See the Lives of de Ranee. A minute account of the observance 
is in de Ranee's Reglemens de la Trappe (1701). The beginning of 
the reform is told by Helyot, Histoire des ordres religieux (1718), vol. 
vi. ch. 1 ; the developments under Dom Augustine de Lestrange are 
described in the supplementary matter in Migne's Dictionnaire des 
ordres religieux (1858). The whole subject is well treated by Max , 
Heimbucher, Orden u. Kongregationen (1907), vol. i. §48; and in 
Wetzer und Welte, Kirchenlexicon (2nd ed.), and Herzog, Realencyklo- 
pddie (3rd ed.). A realistic and sympathetic picture of Trappist life 
is the redeeming feature of J. Huysman's En route. (E. C. B.) 

TRAQUAIR, SIR JOHN STEWART, ist Earl of (d. 1659), 
Scottish statesman, was the son of John Stewart, the younger, 
of Traquair in Peeblesshire, of a branch, originally illegitimate, 
of the house of Buchan, and was created Baron Stewart of 
Traquairin 1628 and earl of Traquair in 1633. He was appointed 
treasurer depute of Scotland and an extraordinary lord of session 
in 1630, and is said to have given the casting vote against the 
second Lord Balmerino at his trial in 1634, but afterwards 
obtained his pardon. From 1636 to 1641 he held the office of 
lord high treasurer of Scotland, and aided Charles I. in intro- 
ducing the liturgy. He endeavoured to prevent a conflict by 
impressing on the king the necessity of caution and the danger 
of extreme measures against the rioters. He was, however, 
compelled to publish Charles's proclamation enforcing the use of 
the liturgy and forbidding hostile demonstrations on pain of 
treason (1638). This was followed by military measures in which 
Traquair assisted by secretly conveying munitions of war to 
Dalkeith Palace. He was, however, obliged to surrender the 
place with the regalia to the Covenanters (March 1639). 
After the treaty of Berwick he was appointed the king's com- 
missioner to the assembly at Edinburgh (August 1639), and 
he assented in writing to the act abolishing episcopacy, but 
prevented its ratification by adjourning the opening of parlia- 
ment. His apparent double-dealing made him suspected by 
both parties, and in 1641 the Scottish parliament issued a 
warrant for his arrest. In his absence he was sentenced to 
death, but, although the king secured the remission of this 
penalty, he was dismissed from his office of treasurer, and in 
1644, for repairing to the court and opposing the covenant, 
he was declared an enemy to religion and fined 40,000 marks. 
His son, Lord Linton, whom he had sent to Montrose with 
a troop of horse, withdrew on the eve of the battle of Philip- 
haugh (September 1645) an <l it has been supposed that Traquair 
betrayed Montrose's plans to Leslie. He was readmitted to 
parliament in 1646, raised cavalry for the " engagement " 
between the king and the Covenanters, and was captured at 
Preston (1648). He was released by Cromwell in 1654, and died 
on the 27th of March 1659. He was succeeded by his only son 
John (c. 1622-1666), whose descendants held the title until 1861, 
when on the death of Charles, the 8th earl, it became dormant 
or extinct.

TRASIMENE, LAKE (Lat. Trasumenus Locus; Ital. Lago 
Trasitneno), a lake of Umbria, Italy, 12 m. W. from 
Perugia, 843 ft. above sea-level, 30 m. in circumference, and

8 m. to 14 m. across. Having no natural outlet, it was formerly- 
subject to sudden rises, which occasioned inundations, and 
these in turn malaria. An artificial outlet was completed in 1898 
from the south-east corner of the lake to the Caina, a small 
tributary of the Tiber. The work, which is about 4 m. long, 
cost only about £26,000. It is intended to leave about 2500 
acres of land dry, and to convert another 2800 acres of marshy 
soil into cultivable land. The lake contains three small islands: 
Isola Maggiore, with a monastery, Isola Minore and Isola 
Polvese. Standing on a promontory jutting out into the 
lake is the town of Castiglione del Lago, which possesses a 
castle of the dukes of Cornia, built by Galeazzo Alessi, the 
architect of many of the Genoese palaces. Napoleon I. formed 
a project for draining the lake, which may ultimately be adopted. 
Here Hannibal disastrously defeated the consul C. Flaminius. 
Hannibal left his winter quarters in Cisalpine Gaul in the 
spring of 217 B.C. and crossed the Apennines, probably by the 
pass now known as the Passo dei Mandrioli (from Forli to Bib- 
biena in the upper valley of the Arno). His march was much 
hindered by marshes (probably those in the Arno valley between 
Bibbiena and Arezzo). The Roman army under Flaminius 
was stationed at Arezzo (anc. Arretium), and Hannibal marched 
past it. Flaminius followed, and Hannibal occupied the 
heights on the north of the lake between Terontola and Tuoro, 
commanding the road from Cortona to Perugia, and also those 
on the east of Tuoro, so that when the Roman army (which 
had encamped the night before outside the entrance to the 
small valley of the brook now called Sanguineto, west of Tuoro), 
unable in the mists of early morning to see the enemy's forces, 
had entered the valley, it was surrounded and there was no 
escape except by forcing a passage. The vanguard succeeded 
in making their egress on the east by Passignano, but the defeat 
of the rest of the army was complete, the Romans losing no 
fewer than 15,000 men.

TRASS, the local name of a volcanic tuff occurring in the Eifel, 
where it is worked for hydraulic mortar. It is a grey or cream- 
coloured fragmental rock, largely composed of pumiceous dust, 
and may be regarded as a trachytic tuff. It much resembles 
the Italian puzzolana and is applied to like purposes. Mixed 
with lime and sand, or with Portland cement, it is extensively 
employed for hydraulic work, especially in Holland; whilst 
the compact varieties have been used as a building material 
and as a fire-stone in ovens. Trass was formerly worked 
extensively in the Brohl valley and is now obtained from 
the valley of the Nette, near Andernacb. 

TRAtf (Serbo-Croatian Trogir; Lat. Tragurium), a seaport 
of Dalmatia, Austria. Pop. (1900) of town and commune, 
17,064. Trau is situated 16 m. W. of Spalato by road, on an 
islet in the Trau channel, and is connected with the mainland 
and the adjoining island of Bua by two bridges. The city 
walls are intact on the north, where a 15th-century fort, 
the Castel Camerlengo, overlooks the sea. Above the main 
gateway the lion of St Mark is carved, and the general aspect 
of Trau is Venetian. Its streets, which are too narrow for 
wheeled traffic, contain many interesting churches and medi- 
eval houses, including the birthplace of the historian Giovanni 
Lucio (Lucius of Trau), author of De regno Dalmatiae et Croatiae 
(Amsterdam, 1666). The loggia, built by the Venetians, 
is a fine specimen of a 16th-century court of justice; and 
the cathedral is a basilica of rare beauty, founded in 1200 
and completed about 1450. It was thus mainly built during 
the period of Hungarian supremacy; and, in consequence, 
its architecture shows clear signs of German influence. Among 
the treasures preserved in the sacristy are several interesting 
examples of ancient jewellers' work. Trail has some trade in 
wine and fruit. It is a steamship station, with an indifferent 
harbour. 

Traguriurn was probably colonized about 380 B.C. by 
Syracusan Greeks from Lissa, and its name is sometimes derived 
from Troghilon a place near Syracuse. Constantine Porphyro- 
genitus writing in the 10th century, regards it as a corruption 



of ayyvpiov, water melon, from a fancied similarity 
in shape. He states that Trau was one of the few Dalmatian 
cities which preserved its Roman character. In 998 it sub- 
mitted to Venice; but in 1105 it acknowledged the supremacy of 
Hungary, while retaining its municipal freedom, and receiving, 
in 1 108, a charter which is quoted by Lucio. After being 
plundered by the Saracens in 11 23, it was ruled for brief 
periods by Byzantium, Hungary and Venice. In 1242 
the Tatars pursued King Bela IV. of Hungary to Trau, but 
were unable to storm the island city. After 1420, when the 
sovereignty of Venice was finally established, Trau played no 
conspicuous part in Dalmatian history.

TRAUN, OTTO FERDINAND, Count von Abensperg und 
(1677-1748), Austrian field marshal, came of a noble family 
and was born on the 27th of August 1677 at Oldenburg. 
He was sent to Halle to complete his education, but in 1693 
left the university to serve with the Prussian contingent of 
the allied army in the Low Countries. He saw much service 
in the War of the Grand Alliance, and at its close entered the 
imperial army. The War of the Spanish Succession soon followed, 
and Traun served with distinction in Italy and on the Rhine 
till 1709, when he became lieutenant-colonel and aide-de-camp 
to Field Marshal Count Guido Starhemberg (1654-1737) in Spain. 
A year later, for specially distinguished services, he was made 
colonel, and in 171 2 chief of a regiment of foot. Soon after 
the close of the war he was again actively employed, and at 
the action of Francavilla in Sicily (June 20, 17 19) he received 
a severe wound. For his services in this campaign in southern 
Italy he was promoted General-Feldwachtmeister in 1723. 
In 1727 he became governor of Messina, and in 1733 attained 
the rank of lieutenant field marshal. In 1734 he won a 
European reputation by his defence first of the pass of S. 
Germano and then of the half-ruined fortress of Capua, which 
he surrendered, marching out with the honours of war on the 
30th of November. He was at once promoted Feldzeugmeister 
and employed in a difficult semi-political command in Hungary, 
after which he was made commander-in-chief in north Italy 
and interim governor-general of the Milanese, in which capacity 
he received the homage of the army and civil authorities on 
the accession of Maria Theresa in 1740. In the following 
year he was made a field-marshal. The Italian campaigns of 
the War of the Austrian Succession were successfully conducted 
by him up to 1743, when, on the death of Field-Marshal Count 
Khevenhuller (q.v.), he was made the principal military 
adviser of Prince Charles of Lorraine (^.v.), who commanded 
the Austrians in Bohemia and on the Danube. In this capacity 
he inspired the brilliant operations which led up to the passage 
of the Rhine (see Austrian Succession, War of the) 
and the skilful strategy whereby Frederick of Prussia was 
forced to evacuate Bohemia and Moravia (1744) without a 
battle. Traun's last active service was the command of an 
army which was sent to Frankfurt to influence the election of a 
new emperor to succeed Charles VII. He died at Hermannstadt 
on the 1 8th of February 1748.

TRAUNSTEIN, a town and summer resort of Bavaria, situated, 
at an elevation of nearly 2000 ft., on the river Traun, 73 m. 
by rail S.E. of Munich. Pop. (1905), 7447. It distils 
salt from the brine of Reichenhall, whence (22 m. distant) 
it is brought in pipes. It has an Jiistorical museum, four 
churches (three of which are Roman Catholic), two fine foun- 
tains — a monument of the war of 1870-71 and one to King 
Maximilian II. There are saline baths and breweries. In 
the vicinity are Empfing, with baths of all kinds and a cold- 
water cure establishment on the Kneipp system. Traunstein 
received civic rights in 1375.

TRAUTENAU— TRAVNIK 



TRAUTENAU (Czech Trutnov), a town of Bohemia, 120 m. 
E.N.E. of Prague by rail. Pop. (1900), i4»777> mostly 
German. It is situated on the Aupa, a tributary of the Elbe, 
at the foot of the Riesengebirge, and possesses a beautiful 
church built in 1283 and restored in 1768. Trautenau is the 
centre of the Bohemian tinen industry and has factories for the 
manufacture of paper and for the utilization of the waste products 
of the other mills. Trautenau was founded by German colonists 
invited to settle there by King Otto Kar II. of Bohemia, and 
received a charter as a town in 1340. It was the scene of two 
battles between the Prussians and Austrians on the 27th and 
the 28th of June 1866. 

TRAVANCORE, a state of southern India, in political relation 
with Madras. Area, 7091 sq. m. In 1901 the population 
was 2,952,157, showing an increase of 15% in the preceding 
decade. The state stands sixteenth among the native states 
of India in area and third in population. Travancore extends 
more than 150 m. along the west coast as far as Cape Comorin, 
the southernmost point of the peninsula. The Western Ghats 
rise to an elevation of 8000 ft. and are clothed with primeval 
forest; they throw out spurs towards the coast, along which 
there is a belt of flat country of about 10 m. in width, covered 
with coco-nut and areca palms, which to a great extent constitute 
the wealth of the country. The whole surface is undulating, 
and presents a series of hills and valleys traversed from east 
to west by many rivers, the floods of which, arrested by the 
peculiar action of the Arabian Sea, spread themselves out 
into lagoons or backwaters, connected here and there by arti- 
ficial canals, and forming an inland line of smooth-water communi- 
cation for nearly the whole length of the coast. The chief river 
is the Periyar, 142 m. in length. Other important rivers are 
the Pambai and its tributary the Achenkoil, the Kallada, 
and the Western Tambraparni. Iron is abundant and plum- 
bago is worked. Elephants are numerous, and tigers, leopards, 
bears, bison and various kinds of deer abound in the forests. 
Travancore has an abundant rainfall, with every variety of 
temperature. The principal ports are Alleppi, Quilon and Paravur ; 
but there is no real harbour. The state has a fine system of 
roads, and the Cochin-Shoranur and the Tinnevelly-Quilon 
railways pass through it. The Periyar irrigation project con- 
ducts water through the ghats in a tunnel to irrigate the Madras 
district of Madura, for which compensation of Rs. 40,000 is 
annually paid to Travancore. Trade is large and increasing, 
the chief exports being copra, coir and other coco-nut products, 
pepper, tea, sugar, areca-nuts, timber, hides, coffee, &c. The 
capital is Trivandrum. The revenue is £670,000 ; tribute, 
£80,000; military force, 1360 infantry, 61 cavalry and 30 
artillery with 6 guns. The maharaja of Travancore claims 
descent from Cheraman Perumal, the last Hindu monarch 
of united Malabar, whose date is variously given from a.d. 
378 to 825. Though he is a Kshatriya, the succession follows 
the local custom of inheritance through females; consequently 
his sanad of adoption authorizes him to adopt sisters' sons. 
For some generations the rulers have been men of education 
and character, and the state is conspicuous for good adminis- 
tration and prosperity. Education, and female education in 
particular, is more advanced than in any other part of India. 
The two dominant sections of the population are the Namburi 
Brahmins and the Nairs or military caste. Native Christians, 
chiefly of the Syrian rite, form nearly one-fourth of the whole, 
being more numerous than in any Madras district.

TRAVE, a river of north Germany, rising in the Oldenburg 
principality of Lubeck, between Eutin and Ahrensbock. Flowing 
at first southwards through small lakes and marshes, it then 
turns west and, confined within flat and sandy banks, enters 
the Prussian province of Schleswig-Holstein. It now bends 
due south to Oldesloe, from which point it is navigable. 
Hence it takes an easterly course, and, entering the territory 
of the free city of Llibeck, receives from the right the Stecknitz, 
through which and the Stecknitz canal built by the merchants 



of Lubeck in 1398) a direct water communication is maintained 
with the Elbe, and passing the city of Lubeck discharges 
itself into the Baltic at the port of Travemxinde after a course of 
58 m. Its lower course from Lubeck to the sea has been 
dredged to a depth of 25 ft., permitting sea-going vessels to lie 
alongside the wharves and qua^s. 

TRAVELLER'S TREE, a remarkable tree, native of Mada- 
gascar and Reunion, with a straight stem reaching 30 ft. in 
height and bearing at the top a number of large long-stalked 
leaves which spread vertically like a fan. The leaf has a large 
sheath at the base in which water collects in such quantity as 
to yield a copious draught — hence the popular name. The plant 
is known botanically as Rarenala Madagascar iensis and belongs 
to the same family as the banana (Musaceae). 

TRAVEMUUfDE, a seaport of Germany, in the free state of 
Lubeck, situated on the Baltic, at the mouth of the Trave. 
Pop. (1905), 2017. It has an Evangelical church, dating from 
the end of the 15th century, and is a much frequented watering- 
place. There are extensive herring fisheries. Travemiinde 
arose out of a stronghold placed here by Henry the Lion, duke 
of Saxony, in the 12th century to guard the mouth of the Trave, 
and the Danes subsequently strengthened it. . It became a town 
in 1317 and in 1329 passed into the possession of the free city 
of Lubeck, to which it has since belonged. Its fortifications 
.were demolished in 1807. 

TRAVERSE, in fortification, a mass of earth or other material 
employed to protect troops against enfilade. It is constructed 
at right angles to the parapet manned by the defenders, and is 
continued sufficiently far to the rear to give the protection 
required by the circumstances, which, moreover, determine its 
height. A traverse is sometimes utilized as a casemate. Ordi- 
nary field-works, not less than those of more solid construction, 
require traversing, though if the trenches, instead of being 
continuous, are broken into short lengths, they are traversed 
by the unbroken earth intervening between each length. (For 
traversing in surveying see Surveying.) 

TRAVERSE CITY, the county-seat of Grand Traverse county, 
Michigan, U.S.A., on the Boardman river, between Boardman 
Lake and the west arm of Grand Traverse Bay, in the N.W. part 
of the lower peninsula. Pop. (1900), 9407, of whom 2068 were 
foreign-born; (1910, census), 12,115. It is served by the Pere 
Marquette, the Grand Rapids & Indiana and the Manistee 
& North-Eastern railways, and by steamboat line to Chicago 
and other lake ports. The climate, scenery and good fishing 
attract summer visitors. The city has a public library and a 
library owned by the Ladies' Library Association, and is the seat 
of the Northern Michigan Asylum for the Insane (opened 1885). 
There are various manufactures, and in 1904 the total value of 
the factory product was $2,176,903. Traverse City was settled 
in 1847, incorporated as a village in 1881 and chartered as a 
city in 1895. 

TRAVESTY (Fr. travestte, from travestir, to disguise, se 
travestir, to change one's clothes; Lat. trans y across, and vestire, 
to clothe), a burlesque, particularly a grotesque imitation of a 
serious work of literature or art, in which the subject, characters, 
&c, are retained, but the style, language and treatment generally 
are exaggerated and distorted to excite ridicule (see also 
Burlesque). 

TRAVNIK, the capital of a department of the same name in 
Bosnia; situated on the Lasva, a left-hand tributary of the 
Bosna, 44 m. by rail N.W. of Serajevo. Pop. (1895) about 
6000. Travnik is mainly built round a steep mass of rock, 
crowned by an ancient citadel. Several mosques, palaces, 
arcades and a fine bazaar, left among its narrow lanes and wooden 
huts, bear witness to its former prosperity, and there are some 
good modern barracks and public buildings. 

The old name of Travnik, La$va t was last used in the 18th 
century. It is likely, from the number of Roman remains, 
that Travnik stands near the site of a Roman colony. It was a 
stronghold of the Bogomili during the 15th century, but its 
period of greatness dated from 1686, when the downfall of 
the Turks in Hungary caused the removal of the Bosnian

government from Banjaluka, which was dangerously near the 
Hungarian frontier, and the Turkish governors, officially 
styled " valis of Hungary," ruled in Travnik from 1686 to 1850. 

Several interesting villages, none containing more than a few 
.hundred inhabitants, are grouped together, near Travnik. Prozor, 
with its ruined citadel, which withstood the Turkish advance until 
the beginning of the 16th century, when almost the whole of Bosnia 
had been enslaved, was then the capital of the princes of Rama, a dis- 
trict lying north-west of the Narenta. The thermal station of Kiseljak, 
where the Fojnica and Lepenica rivers meet, is a cluster of old- 
fashioned Turkish villas, with a casino, baths, barracks, hotels 
and park. In 1396, Tvrtko I. of Bosnia -granted the privilege of 
silver-mining here to the Ragusans. Remains of old workings 
may still be seen. Kresevo, 5 m. N.N.E., is likewise rich in iron, 
cinnabar, quicksilver and the argentiferous load which was worked 
by the Saxons in the middle ages. The citadel of Zahor, or Gradina, 
now a ruin, guarded the mines. Bugojno, on the Vrbas, is a pic- 
turesque place, with a large cattle and horse trade. The Franciscan 
monastery of Fojnica, i8m.east, is the largest and wealthiest founda- 
tion in Bosnia. Its Byzantine church is full of ancient ornaments 
and relics. The archives contain many valuable manuscripts, 
including a charter bestowed on the monks, in 1463 by the Sultan 
Mahomet II. 

TRAWLING, SEINING AND NETTING. The innumerable 
kinds of fishing nets which may be distinguished, if all nets differ- 
ing in details of structure or use be placed in separate classes, 
fall naturally into two main groups, namely stationary nets and 
nets used in motion. The former group contains the most 
primitive nets, though nets of great complexity are now included 
in it; and the simplest fixed nets, themselves derived probably 
from dams of rushes or stones so placed as to lead fish in to a 
" pound " or enclosure, may with some confidence be considered 
as the ancestors of the great otter trawls now shot and towed 
daily from powerful steamers on fishing grounds more than a 
thousand miles from the market they work to supply. The 
more primitive fixed nets are of far less importance than movable 
nets (except in the capture of certain particular species), owing 
to the fact that they are necessarily confined to very shallow water. 
The main types of movable nets may therefore be treated first. 

All nets are constructed in accordance with what is known of the 
habits of the fish they are designed to capture; and as fishes 
may be roughly divided into those spending at least the greater 
part of their lives on or near the sea-bottom and those spending 
a great portion of their lives near the surface, two lines have been 
followed in the development of nets, some being designed to 
work on the bottom, others to work near the surface. The most 
important nets used in the capture of " demersal " or bottom- 
living fishes are trawls; the most important pelagic nets are drift- 
nets. The word trawling 1 was at one time applied to more than 
one method of fishing, but has, at all events in Europe, now 
become restricted to the operation of a flattened conical net 
or trawl, dragged along the sea-bottom. There are two trawls 
in common use, the beam trawl and the otter trawl. They 
differ in the method adopted for extending the mouth of the 
net. The original form is the heam trawl. 

The beam trawl may be described as a flattened conical net 
whose mouth is kept open when in use by a long beam supported 
The Beam ?' tne ena<s D y * ron runners, the trawl-heads. Elm 
TrawL 1S generally preferred for the beam, selected if possible 
from timber grown just to the proper thickness, that 
the natural strength of the wood may not be lessened by more 
trimming or chipping than is absolutely necessary. If^ the re- 
quired length and thickness cannot be obtained in one piece, two 
or even three pieces are scarfed together, and the joints secured by 
iron bands. The trawl-heads differ somewhat in form in different 
countries and in different localities. The usual form is heart- 
shaped, the " shoe " or part actually in contact with the ground 
when in use being straight, the after-side straight and sloping 
upwards from the hindmost point or " heel," and then curving 
down in a single unbroken arc, which forms the front of the head, 
to join the shoe. ^ In the Barking pattern the head is stirrup- 
shaped; but this is now unusual. A square socket is bolted to the 
top of the head (taking the head to be in the position of use) to 
receive the end of the beam, and ring-bolts are put in at the extreme 
front of each head, to hold the ropes or wires by which the trawl 

1 " Trawl " is from O. Fr. trauler, to go hither and thither; 
" troll," now used of drawing a line along the surface of the water 
from a boat, is from the variant O. Fr. trotter, mod. trdler, to lead, 
drag about. 



is towed, and, within'the point of the heel, for the purpose of allowing 
the mouth of the net to be seized or lashed to the trawl-head at a 
point close to the ground. The shoe of the trawl-head is in the 
full-sized trawls made of double thickness, to resist wear. 

When the net is spread out in the position it woulcl take up when 
working, the upper part or back has its straight front edge fastened 
to the beam, but the corresponding lower part or belly th*>n t 
is cut away in such a manner that the front margin ifle ' ver - 
forms a deep curve extending from the shoe of one trawl-head to that 
of the other, the centre of the curve or "bosom," as it is called, being 
at a considerable distance behind the beam. The usual rule in English 
trawls is for the distance between the beam and the centre of the bosom 
tobe about the same as the length of the beam. In French trawls 
this distance is generally much less; but in all cases the beam and 
back of the net must pass over a considerable space of ground when 
the trawl is at work before the fish are disturbed by much of the 
lower margin of the net. This lower edge of the mouth of the trawl 
is fastened to and protected by the " ground-rope," which is made 
of an old hawser " rounded " or covered with small rope to keep 
it from chafing, and to make it heavier. The ends of the ground- 
rope are fastened at each side by a few turns round the back of the 
trawl-heads, just above the shoe, and the rope itself rests on the 
ground throughout its entire curve. The fish which may be dis- 
turbed by it have therefore no chance of escape at either the sides 
or top of the net unless they can pass through the meshes, and as the 
outlet under the beam is a long way past them, and is steadily 
moving on, sooner or later they mostly pass over the ground- 
rope and find their way into the funnel-shaped end of the net, 
from which a small valve of netting prevents their return. 

It must not be supposed, of course, that all fishes entering a trawl 
are retained in it. Numerous investigations have been made into 
the size and number of the various species of fish which get through 
the meshes of the trawl, by lacing small-meshed netting over the 
ordinary net, and examining the fish remaining in this outer net. 
Fish are found to escape all parts of the net, but chiefly the " bat- 
ings, " i.e. the part of the net where it is narrowing to the " cod 
end "; and as the chance of escape depends on the size and shape 
of the fish, and the mesh of the net, it is naturally found that the 
maximum size of the individuals which can escape in any numbers 
differs in different species. If small fish are on the ground, the total 
number escaping is, however, in all cases very large, frequently 
greatly exceeding the number caught. This is for the most part 
desirable, the fish being of a size to render them of but little value 
to the fishermen or to the public. It is in any case inevitable, 
since a full-sized trawl made entirely of small-mesh would offer so 
great a resistance to the water as to be unworkable. 

The ground-rope bears directly on the ground, and to 
prevent the possibility of the fish passing under it, the rope 
should have some weight in it so as to " bite " well, or press the 
ground closely. It is, however, always made of old material, so 
that it may break in case of getting foul of rocks or such other 
chance obstruction as may be met with on the generally smooth 
ground where the trawl can only be worked with advantage. If 
in such a contingency the rope were so strong and good as not to 
break, there would be serious danger of the tow-rope snapping, 
and then the whole apparatus might be lost; but the ground-rope 
giving way enables the net to be cleared and hauled up with pro- 
bably no more damage to it than the broken rope and perhaps 
some torn netting. The remaining part of the trawl, extending 
from the bosom to the extreme end, forms a complete bag gradually 
diminishing in breadth to within about the last 10 ft., which part 
is called the " cod or purse," and is closed by a draw-rope or " cod- 
Hne "at the extremity when the net is being used. To avoid the 
abrasion of the under part of the cod-end pressed by the weight 
of fish against the stones and shells of the sea-bottom, stout pieces 
of old net are laced across beneath it in parallel strips. These 
strips thus trail beneath the trawl and protect it. They constitute 
the" rubbers "or" false belly." The cod-end is the general receptacle 
for the various fishes which enter the net; and when the trawl 
is hauled up and got on board the vessel, the draw-rope is cast off 
and the fish all fall out on the deck. 

It has been mentioned that the body of the net tapers away to 
the entrance to the purse. It is at this point the opening of the 

Cockets are placed ; and they are so arranged that the fish pockets 
aving passed into the purse, and then seeking to escape 
by returning along its sides, are pretty sure to go into the pockets, 
which extend for a length of about 15 or 16 ft. along the inner side 
of the body of the net, and there, the more they try to press for- 
ward, the more tightly they become packed, as the pockets gradu- 
ally narrowaway to nothing at their upper or front extremity. These 
pockets are not separate parts of the trawl, but are made by merely 
lacing together the back and belly of the net, beginning close to the 
margin or side nearly on a level with the bosom, and then being carried 
on with slowly increasing breadth backward as far as the entrance 
to the purse. At this point the breadth of the net is divided into 
three nearly equal spaces, the central one being the opening from 
the main body of the net into the jDurse, or general receptacle for 
the fish, which must all pass through it, and those on each side being 
the mouths of the pockets facing the opposite direction. The central 



2l8 



TRAWLING, SEINING AND NETTING 



passage has a valve or veil of netting called the " flapper,'* which 
only opens when the fish press against it on their way into the purse. 
To understand clearly the facilities offered to the fish to enter the 
pockets, it is necessary to remember that the trawl, when at work, 
is towed along, with just sufficient force to expand the net by the 
resistance of the water. But this resistance directly acts only on 
the interior of the body of the net between the pockets and then 
on the purse ; it does not at first expand the pockets, but tends rather 
to flatten them, because they are virtually outside the general 
cavity of the trawl and their openings face the father end of it. 
The water, however, which has expanded the body of the net, then 
passes under or through the flappei or valve, and enters the purse, 
which, being with a much smaller mesh than the rest of the net, 
offers so much resistance that it cannot readily escape in that 
direction; return currents are consequently formed along the sides, 
and those currents open the mouths of the pockets, which, as 
before mentioned, are facing thejn; and the fish, in their endeavours 
to escape, and finding these openings, follow the course of the pockets 
until they can go no^ farther. The whole of the net is therefore 
well expanded, but it is so by the pressure of the water in one direc- 
tion through the middle, and in the opposite direction at the sides 
or pockets. 

The dimensions of a full-sized beam trawl, such as has been 
described above are from 45 to 50 ft. along the beam and about 
Size mad J P° * tm m ^"S 1 ^. Trawls of practically all smaller 
Mesh. s * zes down to some 30 ft. are to be found, but except 

for shrimp trawls the large sizes predominate almost 
to the exclusion of smaller nets. The trawl-heads support the beam 
at about 3 or 3J ft. above the ground. The meshes of the net 
behind the beam (the square) are about 5 in. from knot to knot, 
when drawn out taut. In the batings, the part of the net in which 
the narrowing mostly occurs, they decrease gradually from 4 to 
about 3 in.; in cod end they are i\ in. In the hope of protecting 
the small fish from capture some local authorities enforce within 
their jurisdiction a minimum size of mesh for trawls, as for other 
nets. According to certain recent by-laws of the Lancashire and 
Western Sea Fisheries District Committee, for instance, every 
trawl used in their waters, except for the capture of shrimps and 
certain specified fish, must allow a square wooden gauge of a certain 
size to pass^ easily through its meshes when these are wet. 
The difficulties in the way of the efficacy of such restriction are 
that a mesh which would allow the escape of fish of but little 
value of one species might allow the escape of very valuable indi- 
viduals of another kind; and that both local and national authori- 
ties alike have powers of jurisdiction over such narrow strips of 
coastal water, that in the absence of an international agreement 
on the matter, the ground affected by the regulations is exceedingly 
small in comparison with the ground untouched. The same remarks 
apply to the similar regulations as to length of beam and circum- 
ference of nets. 

Considerable skill is needed to work a beam trawl successfully.

Working tid ? ls essential ; for the trawl is towed with the stream, 
theNeU a ^ n ' e ^ a ? ter tnan lt ls running, so that there may be 
just sufficient resistance to expand the net. The regu- 
lation of speedy seeing that beam trawls are worked only from 
sailing vessels, is a matter of difficulty; when, however, there 
is a sufficiency of wind much can be done by an adjustment of the 
length of tow rope. Lowering the trawl is also a matter of diffi- 
culty especially when wind and tide are contrary, as in that case 
the vessel tends to drift over the net: the apparatus is first got into 
position by paying out the rope attached to the trawl-heads in such 
proportions that the beam takes its proper position while close to 
the surface. These ropes, called "bridles, " are some 15 fathoms 
long: they meet and are shackled to the trawl warp, a manilla 
rope of 6 in. circumference, of which 150 fathoms are generally 
carried. The trawl being in proper position, the warp is allowed 
to run out and the trawl lowered to the bottom, the vessel slowly 
moving on meanwhile; usually the length of warp which is below 
the surface in towing is a few fathoms over three times the depth 
of water. The art of shooting the trawl lies in causing it to alight 
on its runnersor shoes, with the net freely trailing behind: should 
the net be twisted, or the trawl alight on its beam, the trawl has 
been shot " foul, " and must be hauled and shot again. While towing, 
an experienced fisherman can tell by pressing his hand firmly on the 
warp outside the ship's bulwark whether the progress of the trawl 
over the bottom is satisfactory, any irregular progress over rough 
ground revealing itself in the character of the vibration of the warp. 
t The trawl usually remains on the 'bottom for a whole tide, or 
six hours, and will in this time have passed over some 15 m. of 
ground. Hauling, a most lengthy and laborious process if carried 
out by hand-windlass, is in practically all modern fishing smacks 
carried out by a small steam capstan, the " steam man " as it is 
frequently called, a most efficient instrument with very compact 
engine housed under a small iron cover on the capstan's top. When 
the trawl comes alongside the heavy beam is secured by its two 
h^ads, the net is hauled over the side bit by bit, by hand, until 
the cod end is reached, when a rope is passed round it above the 
bulging end which contains the catch, and then over a " tackle "or 



pulley, and so the cod end is hoisted inboard. The knot of the cod- 
line is untied, and the fish, mixed with various invertebrate animals, 
star-fish and rooted forms (confounded in the one term " scruff "), 
falls to the deck. 

A small trawl is often used from an open boat for shrimping. 
It closely resembles a beam trawl, but has no pockets. The usual 
dimensions of this net are about 15 ft. beam and 20 
total length, of which about 4 ft. are taken by the cod z? f 
end. The mesh^ is about half an inch square, but "'<■»'«• 
where no restrictions are enforced it decreases to a considerably 
smaller size as the cod end is approached. The beam when in use 
is about a foot and a half above the ground. 

Shank nets are also srmilar to beam trawls in general shape, 
but differ in that the mouth is kept open by a rectangle of wood. 
Frequently the lower margin of the trawl's mouth is „- , .. 
not in contact with the ground, being attached to a * aaaK " ets * 
bar of wood which is fixed parallel to the bottom of the wooden 
rectangle and a few inches above it. A fish or prawn is 
thus disturbed by the bottom bar of the wood, and either 
jumps over it and below the net and so escapes, or over both bottom 
bar and middle bar into the net. The theory of the net's action 
is that the fish tends most frequently to take the former course, 
the crustacean the latter; and there is some evidence that this is 
partially realized in practice. Shank nets are sometimes worked 
from carts, when they are known as " Trollopcrs." 

Owing to their fine netting and the very shallow water in which 
they work, shrimp trawls are exceedingly destructive to very small 
fish. Johnstone l has found for instance that in a two mile haul 
of a shrimp trawl on the Lancashire coast 567 small plaice are 
caught on an average, beside great numbers of whiting, dabs, 
soles and other fish. In most parts of the English coast regulations 
are in force as to the mesh, size of beam and length of haul cf 
shrimp nets, and shrimpers working on the beach are ordered to 
sort their catch at the water's edge, returning as many young fish 
alive as possible. The proportion saved by these means is not 
known with accuracy; it is much greater in the case of short hauls 
than in longer ones. A shrimp trawl is usually kept down from half 
an hour to an hour, or when not subject to regulation rather longer.' 
It is seldom towed for a longer period than 2 hours, the speed being 
somewhat under two miles per hour on an average, though subject 
to variation. 

The beam trawl has been described at some length because 
its structure is somewhat more simple than that of the trawl 
now in more general use; the importance of the net oecayot 
a? an engine of capture has undoubtedly declined Beam 
greatly within the past generation. Some interest- Trawling 
ing ^ figures collected by the British Board of *"^fer 
Agriculture and Fisheries prove this incontestably. Trawling 
In 1893 the number of first-class British sailing from 
trawlers was 2037, and their average net tonnage steamers * 
57-4; in 1900 they numbered 925, with a net tonnage of 
41*1, and from that year up to 1906 (the last year quoted 
in these returns) they never again reached a thousand 
in number or a tonnage of 40 tons net; on the other 
hand, there were in no one of the years quoted as few as 
800 first-class sailing trawlers registered, nor did the average 
tonnage sink below 37, about which figure it remained constant. 
It is obvious therefore that about 1894 beam trawling began to 
decline, and that after a time this decline lost most of its power, 
the number of boats and size of boats having sunk to a condition 
in which they fulfilled a certain function, which for some years 
has remained fixed. The new factors which brought about this 
change went hand in hand. They were the invention of the 
otter trawl and the increasing use of steam in fishing vessels. 
The otter trawl has no rigid and heavy beam, but relies on the 
force with which it is towed through the water to keep it open, 
and it is a far more efficient instrument for the capture of all but 
small flat fish than the beam trawl. . Owing to the second of 
these facts its employment inevitably spread, and owing to the 
first a sailing vessel needing at least a moderate breeze to give it 
the requisite speed for keeping a large net open was unsuitable 
for working it. Thus the introduction of the otter trawl un- 
doubtedly hastened the replacement of sails by steam as motive 
power for the great fishing fleets. That the adoption of steam 
would have occurred in any case is almost certain. The con- 
version of drift-net fishing vessels from sail to steam has gone 
on rapidly, though no radical change of gear has taken place, 
and presumably the same would have occurred in the case of 
trawlers had the otter trawl never have introduced. There

were, for instance, nearly 200 steam fishing vessels of various 
descriptions working from English and Welsh ports in 1883; and 
the desire to exploit new and more distant grounds had un- 
doubtedly become powerful by 1894, and accounted to some 
extent for the increase of steam trawling about that time. Never- 
theless this increase is so sudden, that its occurrence at the 
time of the adoption of the otter trawl can scarcely be a coinci- 
dence. In 1893 there were 480 steam trawlers working from 
English and Welsh ports: in 1899 there were over a thousand. 
The subsequent history of British trawling is dominated by the 
steamers. Garstang has calculated from a study of market 
statistics that a steamer (between the years 1889 and 1898) 
caught on the average between four and seven times as much 
in a year as a sailing smack. Against this competition the smacks 
could not succeed; if it was profitable for the steamers to fish 
they could gradually eliminate the smacks, as has occurred at 
Grimsby. The line fishery also decreased owing to the increas- 
ing transfer of the haddock and some other fisheries to the 
trawlers. The change from masts and sails to steam has, how- 
ever, never been complete. The increased cost of building and 
running steamers made the handling o*f large catches a necessary 
condition of their profitable employment. A sailing trawler 
costs from £500 to £1200 to build: £1000 would probably be a 
fair average. A first-class steam trawler of the present day 
costs £10,000 or more, quite ten times as much, and about £5000 
a year to run; and although the cost was less in the early years 
of steam trawling there was always an approach to these, pro- 
portions. On the other hand their rapidity and independence of 
wind made distance between fishing ground and port of landing 
a matter of minor consequence. These causes, combined with a 
very general belief in the exhaustion of the home-grounds — 
there seems no doubt that at all events the catch per vessel 
declined — led to the growth in size and power of the steamers, 
which were used for distant waters and the exploitation of new 
grounds. Thus in 1906 there were only 200 more steam trawlers 
than in 1899, but the average tonnage in the same period 
increased from 54 to nearly 62. To this increase in power and 
range of action of the steamers must be attributed the great 
increase in the quantity of trawled fish landed, since the engine 
of capture, the trawl, has changed but little since 1894: but 
another result occurred, namely a partial division of the area 
trawled between sail and steam. The grounds within easy reach 
of the English ports were left chiefly in the hands of the 
" smacks," the catches never being really very great, though 
possessing a high proportion of " prime " (i.e. valuable species of) 
fish. The persistence of Lowestoft and Ramsgate as smack 
ports speak for this. The longer voyages of the smacks, on the 
other hand, were gradually discontinued, and the distant grounds 
hesides a multitude of new grounds were opened up by the 
steamers. Grimsby, Hull, Aberdeen, Milford, increased enor- 
mously in importance, and now send vessels to the north of 
Russia, to the coast of Africa and far into the Atlantic. Steam 
trawling died at Yarmouth, the place of its birth; sailing trawlers 
disappeared from Grimsby, one of their greatest strongholds, 
but a port near cheap coal, deep water, and a market for fish 
from more distant grounds. 




Fig. I. — Diagrammatic ;^ showing an Otter trawl in use. (For the 
sake of clearness, the size of the otter-boards is exaggerated, and 
the length of the warps and size of the ship diminished.) 



The essential features of the otter trawl are that the mouth is 
kept open by two large wooden boards, whose position when in 
use corresponds to that of the trawl heads in a beam 
trawl, no beam being used. The action of these boards *, be °^ er 
resembles that of a kite. A kite dragged through ™ w y 
still air, owing to the position ot the point of attach- ,T?f 
ment of the string, takes up an oblique position, in OTACtIon - 
which it is acted on by forces in two directions, viz. that exerted 
Through the string, pulling forward, and that exerted by the 
resistance of the air in front of the kite, which, being perpendicular 
to the kite's surface, acts in an upward and backward direction. 
The resultant ot these two forces necessarily acts in a direction 
between them, and the kite accordingly ascends. Constrain the 
kite to move in a horizontal plane, and the same forces would cause 
it to move not upwards, but to the side. A trawl board is practically 
a kite made to move on its side. 

The trawl boards resemble massive wooden doors strengthened 
by iron bands. In action they move with their short edges vertical 
and their long edges horizontal, one in each case in contact with 
the sea bottom : the front bottom corner of each board is rounded off, 
so that the board resembles a sleigh runner. Four strong chains, 
which meet in one iron ring, are attached to each board by ring- 
bolts, and to each ring a wire warp, by which the trawl is towed, 
is shackled. The ringbolts are about the same distance from the 
centre of the board, but the two chains attached to the alter-ring- 
bolts of the board aie longer than the two fore-chains. The trawl 
board when towed thus takes up an oblique position as regards the 
line in which it is towed, though remaining vertical to the ground. 
The force with which it is towed urges it forward ; the resistance of 
the water urges it in a direction perpendicular to its surface, viz. 
backwards and to the side; it accordingly moves in an intermediate 
direction, going forward by tending to diverge from the line of 
towing. Meanwhile the other trawl-board is diverging in a similar 
manner but in the opposite direction, and the mouth of the net, 
being attached to the hinder end of the boards, is thus pulled both 
right and left until stretched to its utmost, and the net is thus 
held open. The margin of the net which forms its upper lip is 
lashed to a rope called the headline: and the resistance of the water 
to the net's progress causes this to assume an arched form, the 
centre of the headline being probably some 10 or 15 ft. from the 
ground. 

It has been calculated by Fulton, who experimented on the 
subject, that the distance between the boards of an otter trawl of 
qo ft. headline is about 60 ft., owing to this arching upwards and 
Backwards of the upper margin of the net. The loss in the spread 
of the net is, however, compensated for very largely, as far as certain 
round fish are concerned, by the increase in height of the mouth, 
the fish which are swimming near but not actually on the bottom 
tending to "strike upward when disturbed. Indeed, the raising 
of the headline is accentuated occasionally by glass spheres or 
other buoyant objects to its centre; corks are still used in this way, 
but otherwise the practice has not been generally adopted in 
commercial trawling. 

The earliest use of the otter board appears to have been due to 
Hearder, an electrician and inventor who designed it about i860. 
It was little used except by amateurs working by steam yachts 
(to whom doubtless the ease with which it could be stowed away 
recommended it), until the late 'eighties, when Danish fishermen 
used otter boards to spread their plaice seines. In 1894 a patent 
was taken out by Scott of Granton for an otter trawl which differed 
from the most modern forms chiefly in possessing rigid bars or brackets 
instead of chains. Chains replaced the bars in the form used by 
Nielsen, a Dane, in 1895. Although numerous variants have since 
arisen, no essential difference in the trawl has been generally adopted. 

The trawl boards, or as they are frequently called " doors, are 
of deal, 8 to 9 ft. long, and 4 to 5 ft. high; they are liberally shod 
and strengthened with iron, and are about 3 in. thick. _ ... f 
The net is fastened to eyes placed at the top and bottom struc j* ure 
of the after-end of the board, but not to any intermediate The Boards 
point. This is to allow the part of the water swirling 
past the board to escape: the entry of the whole of the water 
upon which the net's mouth advances would cause too great a 
resistance. 

Two warps are used, one to each trawl board. These are com- 
posed of wire rope 2J in. round, and when the trawl is inboard lie 
coiled up ,on the separate drums of a steam winch. -. WarD s 
As wire can be run off or wound in on either drum _ ^ * 
separately, the adjustment of the lengths is much simplified. In 
the larger trawlers a thousand fathoms of warp is carried on each 
drum, and the warp is designed to stand a breaking strain of 23 
tons. 

The main form of net is that of the beam trawl. We have, 
as in that net, a coarse meshed netting used near the mouth, a 
decrease in size of mesh as the net narrows, and a bag The Net 
or cod end whose end is fastened by a cod line passed 
through its final meshes. The only essentia^ difference lies in the 
net behind the headline. This has not, as in the beam trawl, a 
straight margin, but a curved one, the pointed sides of the net being 
termed the "top wings" of the trawl, the corresponding parts of 
the bottom being in both trawls the bottom wings. The ground 



220 



TRAWLING, SEINING AND NETTING 



rope resembles that in the beam-trawl, but is in some cases furnished 
with chains or " dangles " or with " bobbins." Bobbins are heavy 
cylindrical wooden rollers, threaded on the wire warp which forms 
the core of the ground rope: they are of two sizes (the larger a foot 
through) placed alternately to ensure freedom of rotation. Their 
object is to surmount or crush obstacles which, by catching the 
ground rope, might capsize the trawl boards and destroy the success 
of the haul; they are accordingly used only on rough ground. 
The chains are fastened to the ground rope in loops, to give it 
weight, and are used on very soft ground to ensure the trawl's 
effectually dislodging the fish. The headline is a rope some 3 in. 
in circumference. 

The meshes are, from knot to knot when drawn taut, from 5? 
to nearly 6 in. in the square and wings, 5 to 4J in. above, and 5 
to rather over 3 in. below in the extreme back of the under batings 
called the " belly," about 2j in. in the cod end. 

The successful shooting of the net is a matter of great skill. The 
paying out of the net, the lowering of the boards, the running out 
yv kt of unequal lengths of the two warps to square the 
thNtf traw l * nto proper position and the subsequent lowering 
of the whole to the bottom, resemble the corresponding 
operations with the beam trawl. The fore warp is then drawn close 
to the quarter of the vessel and shackled to the after-warp close to 
the vessel's side, and the vessel proceeds on her course at a speed 
of some 2} or 2| m. per hour. The length of haul made varies 
enormously. On a ground where fish is very abundant, as in the 
early days of Iceland fishing, it may be half an hour or less: on the 
Eastern Grounds, off Denmark, where the great English fleets 
usually work, it is about 3 hours. When about to haul, the fore 
warp is released from the shackle and the vessel is immediately 
steered towards the side from which the trawl has been towed, 
while the warps are rapidly wound in; the warps thus speedily 
come to stand at right angles to the vessel. If this were not the 
case they might probably foul the vessel's propeller, with very 
serious and possibly fatal consequences to her safety. The trawl 
boards, having been drawn right up to their powerful iron supports 
or gallows, remain suspended there if the trawl is to be re-shot 
while the net is emptied; they are otherwise lowered between the 
gallows and the bulwark, and secured. The hauling in of the catch 
occurs as in the beam-trawl. Trawlers carry a trawl en each side 
of the deck, and in continuous trawling these are worked alternately. 
On each side of the deck a square enclosure called a pound is made for 
the reception of the fish falling from the cod end, by fitting planks 
turned on their sides into stanchions grooved for their reception. 
The fish is sorted into baskets in the pound, cleaned and packed in 
trunks in ice in the hold or fish-room. 

A noteworthy method of trawling is the custom of 50 or 60 
boats fishing together in a fleet. AH these vessels will trawl as 
p . . directed by an " admiral," in proximity to a " mark- 

Piht boat," whose position is known to the owners from 

hismag, day tQ day ^ and the fish j s da jj y f etc hed to market by 

fast " carriers." There are four such fleets of British vessels work- 
ing in the North Sea. It is also worthy of mention that wireless 
telegraphy has recently been fitted to several German trawlers and 
drifters, which can thus communicate with the fishery protection 
cruisers, who pass on information concerning the fishery, and with 
the shore. The practice will doubtless spread, although as yet the 
distance over which a message can be sent by these vessels is very 
small. 

The use of steam has not only increased the radius of action of 
the vessel, but by facilitating the process of hauling enables trawling 
n ih to be carried out in greater depths. The sailing 

akd vessels rarely work in greater depths than 30 fathoms. 

The steam vessels work frequently {e.g. south of 

Ireland) in over 200 fathoms. Commercial trawling in 500 fathoms 

is not unknown, and the Irish research vessel ' Helga " works 

in as much as 800 fathoms. 

The movable nets resembling trawls are seines, from which 
trawls were in all probability developed. The seine is an 
extremely ancient net, used by Phoenicians, Greeks 
and other Mediterranean peoples, the word seine 
being derived from the Greek name (aayrjvr}) for the appli- 
ance. In essence it is a long strip of netting with a 
buoyed headline and weighted ground rope. It is taken 
out in a boat some little distance from the shore, paid 
out during the boat's progress, and the lines attached to 
the ends being then brought back to the shore, the net is hauled 
up on the beach. From this simple form, which is still in use 
for the capture of smelts and other small fish, numerous develop- 
ments have occurred. Before mentioning the details of a few 
of the chief of these it may be said that the changes mainly con- 
sist in the formation of a purse or pocket in the middle of the 
net, somewhat resembling the cod end of a trawl, and in the 
working of the net from boats or ships instead of from the sea. 



Seines, 



The boat is anchored during the hauling, the net being drawn to 
it. A net with a wide spread, furnished with a purse, drawn over 
the sea bottom to a boat, is obviously very near a trawl in its 
action. When in the late 'eighties Danish fishermen fastened 
otter boards to their plaice-seines, and allowed the boat to drift, 
the seine was dragged by, not ( to the boat, and when Petersen 
used a similar arrangement, presently to be described, dragged 
like a trawl, the evolution of a trawl from a seine was practically 
complete. Some such process, with the use of a beam instead 
of otter boards, probably occurred in the past and resulted in the 
beam trawl. 

Pilchard seines, as the most elaborate forms of simple seines, 
may be briefly described. The pilchards approach certain parts of 
the Cornish coast, notably St Ives and Penzance, in pn c hard 
shoals which are eagerly awaited; and when they are seines 
sufficiently near two boats start out on the fishery. 
One carries a short seine, the stop net, which has previously been 
joined to the large seine, and shoots this net as it rows towards 
shore. The other rows along the shore, shooting its net as it goes. 
Ultimately the boats turn to meet each other, and when they do 
so the ends of the long seine are joined, the stop net removed, and 
the circle of netting towed to the beach until its ground rope touches 
the bottom. The pilchards are then removed at leisure by a 
smaller seine called a tuck-net — seine being a word which in the 
west of England is confined to nets worked from the beach. This 
net is very deep in the middle, and as the foot rope is drawn well 
in in hauling, a floor is formed for it as it approaches the boat from 
which it is worked, a simple form of purse or bag resulting. The 
pilchards are dipped out in large baskets. In a good catch this 
process of "tucking" out the fish may be carried^ on for some days. 
The long seine used may be 200 fathoms long, and is about 6 fathoms 
deep at the ends and 8 fathoms in the middle. The tuck-net is 
about 80 fathoms long, 8 deep at the ends and 10 fathoms in the 
middle. The meshes are larger at the ends or wings than in the 
middle, as in the trawl, bringing a tuck-net from 30 down to 42 
the yard. 

The seine is far more used in the United States than in the British 
Islands, its operations being so successful that complaints have in 
some cases been made that local fisheries for certain purse 
species have been entirely destroyed owing to the seines 
diminution of the fish which it has brought about. 
It is used in water of any depth, for the purpose of catching mackerel. 
Rings are fastened to the ground rope, and by means of a rope 
passed through these rings the lower margin of the net is drawn 
together, converting the circle of netting into a complete basin- 
shaped purse. The slack of the net is then gradually drawn in, 
the fish collecting in the last of the net (the fullness or " bunt ") 
to be reached. Purse seines are also used in Japan, where there 
is also in use a net which is a combination of seine and pound-net. 
A long wall of netting forms a " leader " to the fish, and ends in 
an oval enclosure formed by a purse seine with incompletely closed 
ends. Two anchored boats, to which the seine is lashed, keep it 
extended. On hauling, the opening is closed and the slack of the 
net hauled into one boat, which approaches the other, until the 
final portion containing the fish is brought to the surface. 

The pockets of seines, though answering the same purpose as 
those of trawls in preventing the escape of the fish, **c e } aes 
resemble not the pockets but the cod end of the latter Hh 
net. In the filets de boeuf of the Mediterranean the p^ete." 
pocket is a very long bag, trailing behind the arms of^ 
the seine, and constricted for some distance before joining it. It 
is without u flapper " or other valve.

Most efficient pocketed seines are used in Denmark for the capture 
of eels and plaice. In both these nets the depth increases rapidly 
as soon as the extreme wings are left, and is very great in the

middle. Thus when in action but little of the net is vertical; the 
ground and head ropes, though not parallel, tend to become so, 
and the net trails in a curve behind them. Seen from 
above, the whole front margin of the net is semicircular, 
but the net itself is shaped like the hinder part of a trawl : 
in fact, did the headline of a trawl lie not in front but exactly over 
the ground rope, the two nets would be almost identical. 

The eel drag-seine is worked from a boat, in shallow water. 
The extreme ends or wings are attached to two short spars, which 
EelDrae* In use are u P™& nt » and each of these is furnished with 
seine a ^ ne to P anc * bottom which meet and are attached 

to the ropes by which the net is hauled in. The total 
length of the net is about 140 ft. from wing to wing, the length 
of the bag 30 ft., the depth at mouth is 20 ft. opening, the depth 
at the ends 6 or 8 ft. 

The eel drift-net resembles the preceding, but is not drawn to 
an anchored boat, but drifts with the boat; it has accordingly 
Bel Drift' to ^ e made much smaller, its arms being each about 
net. 2 .4 ft* — ° r a tota * length of 50. The wings were some- 

times kept apart by the use of a floating spar, «.o the 
ends of which the seine was attached by short ropes, the spar itself 
being towed. A funnel-shaped valve leads into the bag. 

Petersen's trawl was designed by Dr Petersen for use in deep 
water, and for^ the capture of rapidly moving animals. It is es- 
f sentially a drift-seine of the preceding pattern, worked 
Petersen s w j t ^ tWQ sma jj Qtter boards instead of a beam, and 
• furnished with but a single warp, to which the otter 
boards are attached by shorter ropes or bridles. When used in 
very deep^ water these are prevented from twisting by attaching 
at the point of their junction with the warp a glass float and a 
leaden weight. This net is undoubtedly highly suitable for great 
^depths. Jt is probably the " trawl " which it has been reported 
has been repeatedly used in the great depth of 2900 fathoms from 
the Norwegian research vessel " Michael Sars," in the course of 
the cruisein the Atlantic carried out in 1910 by Sir John Murray 
and Dr Hjort. It is practically a small otter trawl with the square 
cut out, leaving only wings, back part of batings and cod end, 
which last is entered by a funnel of netting. The meshes, in the 
net first constructed by Dr Petersen, were about a centimetre 
square in the wings and 8 millimetres square in the bag. The arms 
were each 24 ft. long, the bag about 16 ft. The boards were 29 in. 
by^ 32 in., and f in. thick. Glass floats are frequently used with 
this trawl, to keep up the headline. 

The Danish plaice-seine resembles the eel-seine in form, but is 
much larger, each arm being about 180 ft. long; the bag is 20 ft. 
Danish long " . Tne dra S lines are also mucn longer, sometimes 

Plalce-selae. reacn i n g to I20 ° fathoms. These nets are worked 
from a very large number of boats, Esbjerg being 
the chief North Sea port engaged in the fishery. The vessels 
are yawl rigged, of the size of all but the largest smacks, and 
each is now furnished with a motor-boat. The boat takes the 
net to a considerable distance from the parent vessel, which is 
anchored, and shoots it in a wide curve. The drag lines are 
then brought back to the smack for hauling. By this method 
plaice arecaptured alive, and are kept in large floating fish-boxes 
until required. 

Next in importance to trawling among the English fisheries 
is the use of drift-nets for mackerel, herrings and pilchards. 
DriitNets ^ * s un douhtedly the most common method of net- 
fishing on the coasts of the British islands, hut no- 
where is it so general as in Scotland. There are, however, great 
drift fisheries on the eastern and southern coasts of England, 
and an important mackerel fishery mainly at the western end 
of the channel, though owing to a high import duty on mackerel 
levied by France this is now of far less importance. The value 
of the mode of fishing technically known as " drifting or driving" 
will be understood when it is remembered that it is the only 
method by which such fishes as herrings, mackerel and pil- 
chards, which generally swim at or near the surface, can be 
readily caught in the open sea, at any distance from land, and in 
any depth of water, so long as there is sufficient for the floating 
of the nets in the proper position. The term "drift-net" is de- 
rived from the manner in which the nets are worked. They 
are neither fixed nor towed within any precise limits of water, 
but are cast out or " shot " at any distance from the land where 
there are signs of fish, and are allowed to drift in whichever 
direction the tide may happen to take them, until it is thought 
desirable to had them in. The essential principle of the working 
of the drift-net is that it forms a long wall or barrier of netting 
hanging for a few fathoms perpendicularly in the water, but 
extending for a great length horizontally, and that the fish, 
meeting these nets and trying to pass them, become meshed; 
they force their heads and gill-covers through the meshes, but 



can go no farther; and as the gill-covers catch in the sides of the 
mesh, the fish are unable to withdraw and escape. Whether it 
he mackerel, herring or pilchard, the manner in which the net 
works is the same; the variations which exist relate only to the 
differences in habits and size of the fish sought after. 

The nets used are light cotton nets, each about 30 yards long and 
10 or 12 deep, and when designed for herring have a mesh of about 
an inch square, pilchard nets being smaller and mackerel nets 
larger in mesh. These nets are laced end to end in a long row, 
the whole row, called a "fleet" or "train " of nets being, in the 
case of the large herring boats, as much as 3J miles long. One of 
the long edges of the net is fastened to a rope corked at regular 
intervals, whose purpose is to keep that part uppermost. This 
edge is called the "back" of the net. The corks are, however, 
not sufficient to keep the whole net from sinking, and this is done 
by buoys called "bowls," which are attached to the back rope 
a u 1 2 t ^ rvals - ft is a lways a matter of uncertainty at what depth 
the fish may be found, and a deal of judgment is needed in deciding 
what length of rope should be used in attaching the buoys. Jn 
the herring fishery of the English east coast the British boats usually 
work in somewhat shallower water than the foreign drifters, and set 
their nets^ at about 4 fathoms from the surface, the foreigners, 
lying outside them, using deeper-set nets. Jt is found convenient 
to colour certain of the bowls distinctively to indicate their position 
in the " fleet. " Otherwise they are coloured to show ownership. 

Drift-net fishing is with rare exceptions only carried on at night. 
The time for beginning is just before sunset, and the nets are then 
got into the water by the time it is dark. A likely place to fish 
is known (though there is much uncertainty in the matter) by signs 
recognizable only to the practised eye. An obvious one is the 
presence of many sea-birds, or of the fish themselves. But besides 
these the appearance and even the smell of the water furnishes 
a guide. In the case of the mackerel these signs have been shown 
by G. E. Bullen (Journ. Marine Biol. Assoc, viii. 269) to be due to 
the character of the microsGQpic organisms in the water, some of 
which furnish the food of the mackerel, others of which it avoids. 
If fish is believed to be present the vessel is sailed slowly before the 
wind and if possible across the tide; then the net is shot or thrown 
out over the vessel's quarter, the men being distributed at regular 
stations, some hauling up the net from below, others throwing it over 
and taking care that it falls so that the foot is clear of the corked 
back; others, again, looking after the warp which has to be paid 
out at the same time, and seeing that the seizings are made fast to 
it in their proper places. When it is all overboard, and about 15 
or 20 fathoms of extra warp, called the " swing-rope, " given out, 
the vessel is brought round head to wind by the warp being carried 
to the bow; the sails are then taken in, the mast lowered, a small 
m:zen set to keep the vessel with her head to the wind, and the regu- 
lation lights are hoisted to show that she is fishing. A few of the 
hands remain on deck to keep a look out, and the vessel and nets 
are left to drift wherever the wind and tide may take them. It is 
very rarely that there is an absolute calm at sea; and if there is 
the faintest breath of air stirring the fishing boat will of course feel 
it more than the buoys supporting the nets; she will consequently 
drift faster, and being at the end of the train, extend the whole 
fleet of nets. In rough weather, as the strain may be greater, 
more rope is used. The first net in the train is often hauled after 
an hour to enable the men to judge whether the position is a good 
one. When the > whole are hauled, the nets are taken in and the 
fish shaken out in the same orderly way as in shooting, each man 
having his own proper duty. 

The sailing drifter is fast disappearing, giving place to the steam 
drifter. These vessels, though costing far more (£2500 to £3000 
against £400 only) catch more fish, have a greater radius of action, 
reach market more quickly and are independent of weather. 
It has been calculated that a thousand square feet of herring 
netting used by a steamer catch 43^ cwt. of herring, while a sailing 
vessel catches 20 cwt. with the same 'area of netting; and the 
steamer-caught fish, being more quickly delivered, fetches a better 
price. It may be noted that of recent years herring have been 
caught at the bottom in considerable quantities by the trawl. The 
fishing of herring is thus increasing in variety of method, as well 
as in intensity. Such sailing boats as tend to remain are long shore 
boats, and such drifters as have been fitted with petrol motors. 

Stationary nets, being of very small importance relatively 
to the preceding, must be dismissed more shortly. 
They are of four main kinds, viz.: stake nets, f£££ ttMr 
pound and kettle nets, stow and bag nets, trammel- 
nets and hose nets. 

Stake nets are usually set between t tide-marks, or in shallow 
water, and, as their name implies, are' kept up by stakes placed 
at intervals. They are generally set across the direction 
of the tide. They act as gill nets, and are chiefly used Stake Nets. 
in America. In some cases a conical bag instead of 
a flat net occupies the space between every two stakes, forming 
a series of simple bag nets. This form is used on the German 
shores of the North Sea.

In another modification the net is supported on the stakes, which 
is some 200 ft. long, does not act as a gill net but as a " leader, " 
p~ a a an ^ one of its ends passes through a narrow opening 
„ . * n into a circular enclosure surrounded by a similar 
Aen/eyvei5. wall of staked net ting. The bag net and fly net 
for the capture of the salmon are merely elaborated forms 
of this type. The pound^ is roofed by netting, in the fly net, and 
in the bag net, which is floated — not staked — floored also. It 
is wedge-shaped, narrowing gradually from the entrance end, and 
divided incompletely by oblique internal walls or valves of netting 
into side compartments. 

The bag net just described is practically a floating stake net. 
A simpler form is used in the Elbe, consisting of a pyramidal net 
Stow Nets wnose m °uth is held open by its sides being attached 
to spars, weighted at one end and buoyed at the other. 
This is the simplest form of stow net. The stow net is used in the 
Thames and Wash ; it is specially designed for the capture of sprats, 
although many young herrings are sometimes caught, andit is worked 
most extensively at the entrance of the Thames. The stow net 
is a gigantic funnel-shaped bag having nearly a square mouth, 
jo ft. from the upper to the lower side, and 21 ft. wide. It tapers 
or a length of about 90 ft. to a diameter of 5 or 6 ft., and further 
diminishes to about half that size for another 90 ft. to the end of 
the net. The whole net is therefore about 180ft. or 60 yards long. 
The upper and lower sides of the square mouth are kept extended 
by two horizontal wooden spars called " balks," and the lower one 
is weighted so as_ to open the mouth of the net in a perpen- 
dicular direction when it is at work. The size of the meshes varies 
from if in. near the mouth to £ in. towards the end, where, 
however, it is again slightly enlarged to allow for the greater 
pressure of the water at that part. The mode of working the net 
is very simple. Oyster smacks are commonly used in this fishery, 
although shrimping boats are also employed in it in the Thames. 
The smack takes up a position at the first of the tide where there 
are signs of fish, or in such parts of the estuary as are frequented 
by the sprats during that part of the season; she then anchors, 
and at the same moment the net is put overboard and so handled 
that it at once takes its proper position, which is under the vessel. 
It is kept there by a very simple arrangement. Four ropes leading, 
one from each end of the two balks, and therefore from the four 
corners of the a mouth of the net, are united at some little distance 
in front, forming a double bridle, and a single mooring rope leads 
from this point of union to the vessel's anchor; so that the same 
anchor holds both the vessel and the net. The net is kept at any 
desired distance from the bottom by means of two ropes, one from 
each end of the upper balk to the corresponding side of the smack, 
where it is made fast. The open mouth of the net is thus kept 
suspended below the vessel, and the long mass of netting streams 
away astern with the tide. The strain of this immense bag-net 
by the force of the tide is often very great, but if the vessel drags 
heranchor, the net being made fast to the same mooring, both keep 
their relative positions. Here they remain for several hours till 
the tide slackens, the vessel's sails being all taken in and only 
one hand being left on deck to keep watch. The way in which 
the fish are caught hardly requires explanation. The sprats, 
swimming in immense shoals, are carried by the tide into the open 
mouth of the net and then on to the small end, where they are 
collected in enormous numbers; from this there is no escape, as the 
crowd is constantly increasing, and they cannot stem the strong 
tide setting into the net. The first thing to be done in taking in 
the net is to close the mouth, and this is effected by means of a chain 
leading from the bow of the vessel through an iron loop in the 
middle of the upper balk down to the centre of the lower one, and 
by heaving in this chain the two balks are brought together and 
ultimately hoisted out of the water under the vessel's bowsprit. 
The net is then brought alongside and overhauled till the end is 
reached, and this is hoisted on board. The rope by which it is 
closed having been cast off, the sprats arc then measured into the 
hold of the vessel by about three bushels at a time, until the net 
has been emptied. The quantity of sprats taken in this manner 
by many scores of fishing craft during the season, which lasts from 
November to February, is in some years simply enormous; the 
markets at^ Billingsgate and elsewhere are inundated with them, 
and at last in many years they can only be disposed of at a nominal 
price for manure; and in this way many hundreds of tons are got 
rid of. The stow boats do not generally take their fish on shore, 
but market boats come off to them and buy the fish out of the 
vessel's hold, and carry it away. The mode of working is the same 
in the Solent and the Wash as that we have described in the Thames 
and large quantities of sprats are landed by the Southampton 
boats. 

" Whitebait," or young sprats, mixed with some young herring 
and other smaH fish, are caught in the Thames by a net which is 
practically nothing else but a very small stow net, and it is worked 
in essentially the same manner. An interesting form of stow net 
is used in the Channels of the Frisian Island, chiefly during the rush 
of the ebb-tide, for the capture of rays (principally Raja davata, 
the Thornback) which are highly valued by the Dutch. It consists 
of a net shaped like an otter trawl, furnished with otter boards, 



which are attached to ropes passed to the ends of long booms which 
project from the sides of the vessel using the net, and also to the 
two anchors by which the former is anchored. 

The remaining stationary nets to be mentioned partake of the 
nature of traps. The trammel net consists of three nets joined 
together at the top, bottom and sides. The whole T 
system of nets hangs vertical, the head line being L ra t mmeI 
buoyed and the ground line weighted. The two outer 
nets^ are much smaller than the inner net, but of wide-meshed 
netting, whereas the inner net is of very small mesh. Consequently, 
a fish meeting an outer net passes through it, strikes the fine-meshed 
net and forces it before it through one of the meshes of the farther 
wide-meshed net; it is thus in a small pocket from which it cannot 
escape. 

The hose net is a long cylindrical net from which trap-like pockets 
open. The main cavity is kept open by rigid rings. The hose 
nets are set between tide marks, at low water, so that 
the tide runs through them; and they are emptied at Hose Net. 
next low tide. 

While unimportant compared with the huge quantity of fish 
landed from sea-going vessels, the catch of the in-shore nets 
described is of importance in respect of the kinds of fish taken, 
whitebait and pilchards, for instance, being not otherwise obtained, 
while salmon, though taken in rivers as well as in estuaries and along 
the coast, is very rarely captured at sea.

TRAY, a flat receptacle with a raised edge used for a variety 
of purposes, chiefly domestic. The tray takes many forms — 
oblong, circular, oval, square; — and is made in a vast number of 
materials, from papier mache to the precious metals. Duke 
Charles of Lorraine had a pen-tray of rock crystal standing on 
golden feet; Marie -Antoinette possessed a wonderful oval tray, 
silver gilt and enamelled, set with 144 cameos engraved with the 
heads of sovereigns and princes of the house of Austria, and 
their heraldic devices. The tea-tray is the most familiar form; 
next to it comes the small round tray, usually of silver or electro- 
plate, chiefly used for handing letters or a glass of wine. When 
thus employed it is usually called a " waiter." The English 
tea-trays of the latter part of the 18th century were usually oval 
in shape and sometimes had handles; mahogany and rosewood 
were the favourite materials. Sheraton and Shearer, among 
other cabinet-makers of the great English period, are credited 
with trays of this type. These were succeeded in the early 
and mid-Victorian period by trays of japanned iron, which 
possessed no charm but had the virtue of durability. Sheffield 
plate snuffer-trays of satisfying simplicity were made in large 
numbers, and are now much sought after. 

TRAZ-OS-MONTES {i.e. across the Mountains), an ancient 
frontier province in the extreme N.E. of Portugal, bounded on 
the N. and E. by Spain, S. by the river Douro which separates 
it from Beira, and W. by the Gerez, Cabreira and Marao Moun- 
tains, which separate it from Entre-Minho-e-Douto. Pop. 
(1900), 427,358; area, 4,163 sq. m. For administrative purposes 
Traz-os-Montcs was divided in 1833 into the districts of Braganza 
{q.v.) and Villa Real (q.v.). The surface is generally moun- 
tainous, although there are tracts of level land in the veigas 
or cultivated plains of Chaves and Miranda do Douro, and in the 
cimas or plateau region of Mogadouro. The highest peak is 
Marao (4642 ft.). The province belongs to the basin of the Douro 
and is chiefly
