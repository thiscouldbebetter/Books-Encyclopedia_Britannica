BASE FEE, in law, a freehold estate of inheritance which is limited or
qualified by the existence of certain conditions. In modern property law
the commonest example of a base fee is an estate created by a tenant in
tail, not in possession, who bars the entail without the consent of the
protector of the settlement. Though he bars his own issue, he cannot bar
any remainder or reversion, and the estate (_i.e._ the _base fee_) thus
created is determinable on the failure of his issue in tail. An example of
this kind of estate was introduced by George Eliot into the plot of _Felix
Holt_. Another example of a base fee is an estate descendible to heirs
general, but terminable on an uncertain event; for example, a grant of land
to A and his heirs, tenants of the manor of Dale. The estate terminates
whenever the prescribed qualification ceases. An early meaning of base fee
was an estate held not by free or military service, but by base service,
_i.e._ at the will of the lord.
