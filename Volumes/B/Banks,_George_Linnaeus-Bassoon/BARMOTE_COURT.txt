BARMOTE COURT (also written BERGHMOTE, BARGHMOTE, BARGEMOTE, BARMOOT), a
name applied to courts held in the lead-mining districts of Derbyshire,
England, for the purpose of determining the customs peculiar to the
industry and also for the settlements of any disputes which may arise in
connexion therewith. Barmote courts are of very ancient origin, having been
in existence in the reign of Edward I. Their jurisdiction extends both to
the crown lands in the duchy of Lancaster and to those under individual
ownership, comprising seven clearly defined districts. Owing to the
progress made in modern mining, many of the customs and much of the
procedure had become obsolete, and their powers were regulated by the High
Peak Mining Customs and Mineral Courts Act 1851. An appeal from the
jurisdiction of the courts lies by way of _certiorari_.
