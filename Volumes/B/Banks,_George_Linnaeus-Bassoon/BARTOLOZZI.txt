BARTOLOZZI, FRANCESCO (1725-1815), Italian engraver, was born at Florence.
He was originally destined to follow the profession of his father, who was
a gold- and silver-smith; but he manifested so much skill and taste in
designing that he was placed under the superintendence of two Florentine
artists, who instructed him in painting. After devoting three years to that
art, he went to Venice and studied engraving. He made very rapid progress,
and executed some works of considerable importance at Venice.. He then
removed for a short time to Rome, where he completed a set of engravings
representing events from the life of St Nilus, and, after returning to
Venice, set out for London in 1764. For nearly forty years he resided in
London, and produced an enormous number of engravings, the best being those
of Clytie, after Annibale Caracci, and of the Virgin and Child, after Carlo
Dolce. A great proportion of them are from the works of Cipriani and
Angelica Kauffmann. Bartolozzi also contributed a number of plates to
Boydell's _Shakespeare Gallery_. In 1802 he was invited to Lisbon as
director of the National Academy. He remained in Portugal till his death.
His son Gaetano Stephano (1757-1821), also an engraver, was the father of
Madame Vestris.
