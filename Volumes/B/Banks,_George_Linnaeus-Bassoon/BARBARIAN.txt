BARBARIAN (Gr. [Greek: barbaros], the name among the early Greeks for all
foreigners. The word is probably onomatopoetic, designed to represent the
uncouth babbling of which languages other than their own appeared to the
Greeks to consist. Even the Romans were included in the term. The word soon
assumed an evil meaning, becoming associated with the vices and savage
natures of which they believed their enemies to be possessed. The Romans
adopted the word for all peoples other than those under Graeco-Roman
influence and domination. It has long become synonymous with a general lack
of civilization.
