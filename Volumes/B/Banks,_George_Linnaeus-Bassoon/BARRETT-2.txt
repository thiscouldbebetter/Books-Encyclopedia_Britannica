BARRETT, LUCAS (1837-1862), English naturalist and geologist, was born in
London on the 14th of November 1837, and educated at University College
school and at Ebersdorf. In 1855 he accompanied R. McAndrew on a dredging
excursion from the Shetlands to Norway and beyond the Arctic Circle; and
subsequently made other cruises to Greenland and to the coast of Spain.
These expeditions laid the foundations of an extensive knowledge of the
distribution of marine life. In 1855 he was engaged by Sedgwick to assist
in the Woodwardian Museum at Cambridge, and during the following three
years he aided the professor by delivering lectures. He discovered bones of
birds in the Cambridge Greensand, and he also prepared a geological map of
Cambridge on the one-inch Ordnance map. In 1859, when twenty-two years of
age, he was appointed director of the Geological Survey of Jamaica. He
there determined the Cretaceous age of certain rocks which contained
Hippurites, the new genus _Barrettia_ being named after him by S. P.
Woodward; he also obtained many fossils from the Miocene and newer strata.
He was drowned at the early age of twenty-five, on the 18th of December
1862, while investigating the sea-bottom off Kingston, Jamaica.
