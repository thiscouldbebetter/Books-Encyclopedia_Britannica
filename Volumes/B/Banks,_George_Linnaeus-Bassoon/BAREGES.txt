BARÈGES, a town of south-western France, in the department of
Hautes-Pyrénées, in the valley of the Bastan, 25 m. S.S.W. of
Bagnères-de-Bigorre by road. The town, which is situated at an altitude of
4040 ft., is hardly inhabited in the winter. It is celebrated for its warm
sulphurous springs (75° to 111° F.), which first became generally known in
1675 when they were visited by Madame de Maintenon and the duke of Maine,
son of Louis XIV. The waters, which are used for drinking and in baths, are
efficacious in the treatment of wounds and ulcers and in cases of scrofula,
gout, skin diseases, &c. There is a military hospital, founded in 1760. The
town was formerly much exposed to avalanches and floods, which are now less
frequent owing to the construction of embankments and replanting of the
hillsides. It is a centre for mountain excursions. The light silk and wool
fabric called _barège_ takes its name from the place, where it was first
made.
