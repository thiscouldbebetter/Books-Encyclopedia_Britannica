BAPHOMET, the imaginary symbol or idol which the Knights Templars were
accused of worshipping in their secret rites. The term is supposed to be a
corruption of _Mahomet_, who in several medieval Latin poems seems to be
called by this name. J. von Hammer-Purgstall, in his _Mysterium Baphometis
relevatum, &c._, and _Die Schuld der Templer_, revived the old charge
against the Templars. The word, according to his interpretation, signifies
the baptism of _Metis_, or of fire, and is, therefore, connected with the
impurities of the Gnostic Ophites (_q.v._). Additional [v.03 p.0364]
evidence of this, according to Hammer-Purgstall, is to be found in the
architectural decorations of the Templars' churches.

An elaborate criticism of Hammer-Purgstall's arguments was made in the
_Journal des Savans_, March and April 1819, by M. Raynouard, a well-known
defender of the Templars. (See also Hallam, _Middle Ages_, c. i. note 15.)
