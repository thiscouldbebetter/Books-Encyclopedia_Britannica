BANN, the principal river in the north of Ireland. Rising in the Mourne
mountains in the south of the Co. Down it runs N.W. until it enters Lough
Neagh (_q.v._), which it drains N.N.W. to an estuary at Coleraine, forming
Lough Beg immediately below the larger lough. The length of its valley
(excluding the lesser windings of the river) is about 90 m. The total
drainage area, including the other important feeders of Lough Neagh, is
about 2300 sq. m., extending westward to the confines of the Co. Fermanagh,
and including parts of the Cos. Down and Antrim, Armagh and Monaghan,
Tyrone and Londonderry. The river has valuable salmon fisheries, but is not
of much importance for navigation. Above Lough Neagh it is known as the
Upper Bann and below as the Lower Bann.
