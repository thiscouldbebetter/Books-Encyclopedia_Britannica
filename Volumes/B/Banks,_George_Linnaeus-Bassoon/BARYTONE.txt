BARYTONE, or BARITONE (Ital. _baritono_, from Gr. [Greek: barutonos], deep
sounding), a musical term for the male voice whose range lies between those
of the tenor and of the bass--a high bass rather than a low tenor; also the
name of an obsolete stringed instrument like the viola da Gamba, and of the
small Bb or C saxhorn.
