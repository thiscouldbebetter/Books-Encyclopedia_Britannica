BARRÉ, ISAAC (1726-1802), British soldier and politician, was born at
Dublin in 1726, the son of a French refugee. He was educated at Trinity
College, Dublin, entered the army, and in 1759 was with Wolfe at the taking
of Quebec, on which occasion he was wounded in the cheek. His entry into
parliament in 1761 under the auspices of Lord Shelburne, who had selected
him "as a bravo to run down Mr Pitt," was characterized by a virulent
attack on Pitt, of whom, however, he became ultimately a devoted adherent.
A vigorous opponent of the taxation of America, his mastery of invective
was powerfully displayed in his championship of the American cause, and the
name "Sons of Liberty," which he had applied to the colonists in one of his
speeches, became a common designation of the American organizations
directed against the Stamp Act, as well as of later patriotic clubs. His
appointment in 1782 to the treasurership of the navy, which carried with it
a pension of £3200 a year, at a time when the government was ostensibly
advocating economy, caused great discontent; subsequently, however, he
received from the younger Pitt the clerkship of the pells in place of the
pension, which thus was saved to the public. Becoming blind, he retired
from office in 1790 and died on the 20th of July 1802.
