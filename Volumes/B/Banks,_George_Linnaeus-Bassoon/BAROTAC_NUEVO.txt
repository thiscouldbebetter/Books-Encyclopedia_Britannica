BAROTAC NUEVO, a town of the province of Iloílo, Panay, Philippine Islands,
near the Jalaur river, above its mouth on the S.E. coast, and about 15 m.
N.E. of Iloílo, the capital. Pop. (1903) 9904; in 1903 after the census had
been taken the neighbouring town of Dumangas (pop. 12,428) was annexed to
Barotac Nuevo. The town lies in a fertile plain and deals in rice, trepang
and pina. Here, in what was formerly Dumangas, are a fine church and
convent, built of iron, pressed brick and marble. Dumangas was destroyed by
fire in June 1900, during a fight with insurgents, but its rebuilding was
begun in May 1901.
