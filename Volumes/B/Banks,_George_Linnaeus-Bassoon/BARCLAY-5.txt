BARCLAY, WILLIAM (1546-1608) Scottish jurist, was born in Aberdeenshire in
1546. Educated at Aberdeen University, he went to France in 1573, and
studied law under Cujas, at Bourges, where he took his doctor's degree.
Charles III., duke of Lorraine, appointed him professor of civil law in the
newly-founded university of Pont-à-Mousson, and also created him counsellor
of state and master of requests. In 1603, however, he was obliged to quit
France, having incurred the enmity of the Jesuits, through his opposition
to their proposal to admit his son John (_q.v._) a member of their society.
Returning to England, he was offered considerable preferment by King James
on condition of becoming a member of the Church of England. This offer he
refused, and returned to France in 1604, when he was appointed professor of
civil law in the university of Angers. He died at Angers in 1608. His
principal works were _De Regno et Regali Potestate, &c._ (Paris, 1600), a
strenuous defence of the rights of kings, in which he refutes the doctrines
of George Buchanan, "Junius Brutus" (Hubert Languet) and Jean Boucher; and
_De Potestate Papae, &c._ (London, 1609), in opposition to the usurpation
of temporal powers by the pope, which called forth the celebrated reply of
Cardinal Bellarmine; also commentaries on some of the titles of the
Pandects.
