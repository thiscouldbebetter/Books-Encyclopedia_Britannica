BARGEBOARD (probably from Med. Lat. _bargus_, or _barcus_, a scaffold, and
not from the now obsolete synonym "vergeboard"), the boards fastened to the
projecting gables of a roof to give strength to the same and to mask or
hide the horizontal timbers of the roof to which they were attached.
Bargeboards are sometimes moulded only or carved, but as a rule the lower
edges were cusped and had tracery in the spandrels besides being otherwise
elaborated. The richest example is one at Ockwells in Berkshire, England,
which is moulded and carved as if it were intended for internal work.
