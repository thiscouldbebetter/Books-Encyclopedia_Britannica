BARBIER, HENRI AUGUSTE (1805-1882), French dramatist and poet, was born in
Paris on the 29th of April 1805. Inspired by the revolution of July he
poured forth a series of eager, vigorous poems, denouncing, crudely enough,
the evils of the time. They are spoken of collectively as the _Iambes_
(1831), though the designation is not strictly applicable to all. As the
name suggests, they are modelled on the verse of André Chénier. They
include _La Curée_, _La Popularité_, _L'Idole_, _Paris_, _Dante_,
_Quatre-vingt-treize_ and _Varsovie_. The rest of Barbier's poems are
forgotten, and when, in 1869, he received the long delayed honour of
admission to the Academy, Montalembert expressed the general sentiment in
his _Barbier? mais il est mort!_ It was even asserted, though without
foundation, that he was not the real author of the _Iambes_. He died at
Nice on the 13th of February 1882. He collaborated with Léon de Wailly in
the libretto of Berlioz's opera, _Benvenuto Cellini_, and his works include
two series of poems on the political and social troubles of Italy and
England, printed in later editions of _Iambes et poèmes_.
