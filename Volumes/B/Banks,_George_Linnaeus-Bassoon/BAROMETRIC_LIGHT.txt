BAROMETRIC LIGHT, the luminous glow emitted by mercury in a barometer tube
when shaken. It was first observed by Jean Picard, and formed the subject
of many experiments at the hands of Francis Hawksbee. The latter showed
that the Torricellian vacuum was not essential to the phenomenon, for the
same glow was apparent when mercury was shaken with air only partially
rarefied. The glow is an effect of the electricity generated by the
friction of the mercury and the air in the barometer tube.
