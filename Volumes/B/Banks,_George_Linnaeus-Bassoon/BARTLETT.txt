BARTLETT, JOHN (1820-1905), American publisher and compiler, was born in
Plymouth, Massachusetts, on the 14th of June 1820. He became a bookseller
and publisher in Cambridge, Mass., and from 1865 to 1889, when he retired,
was a member of the bookselling and publishing firm of Little, Brown & Co.,
in Boston. In 1855 he published the first edition of his _Familiar
Quotations_, subsequently greatly expanded and long the best-known
collection of the sort, and in 1894 (although it had been copyrighted five
years before), after many years' labour, he published his _New and Complete
Concordance or Verbal Index to Words, Phrases and Passages in the Dramatic
Works of Shakespeare; with a Supplementary Concordance to the
Poems_--surpassing any of its predecessors in the number and fulness of its
citations from the poet's writings.. In all of his work he was greatly
assisted by his wife, a daughter of Sidney Willard (1780-1856), professor
of Hebrew at Harvard from 1807 to 1831. Bartlett died at Cambridge, Mass.,
on the 3rd of December 1905.
