district of Barking town (1891) 14,301; (1901) 21,547. The church of St
Margaret is Norman with perpendicular additions, and contains many
monuments of interest. Barking was celebrated for its nunnery, one of the
oldest and richest in England, founded about 670 by Erkenwald, bishop of
London, and restored in 970 by King Edgar, about a hundred years after its
destruction by the Danes. The abbess was a baroness _ex officio_, and the
revenue at the dissolution of the monasteries was £1084. There remains a
perpendicular turreted gateway. There is also an ancient market-house, used
as a town-hall. Victoria Gardens form a public pleasure-ground, and there
are recreation grounds. The Gaslight and Coke Company's works at Beckton
are in the parish, and also extensive rubber works. At the mouth of the
Roding (Barking Creek) are great sewage works, receiving the Northern
Outfall sewer from London. There are also chemical works, and some shipping
trade, principally in timber and fish. Barking is a suffragan bishopric in
the diocese of St Albans.
