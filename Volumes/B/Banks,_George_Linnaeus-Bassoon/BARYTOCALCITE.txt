BARYTOCALCITE, a rare mineral found only at Alston Moor in Cumberland,
where it occurs as diverging groups of white transparent crystals lining
cavities in the Mountain Limestone. [v.03 p.0457] The crystals belong to
the monoclinic system and are usually prismatic or blade-shaped in habit.
The hardness is 4, and the sp. gr. 3.65. There are perfect cleavages
parallel to the prism faces inclined at an angle of 73° 6', and a less
perfect cleavage parallel to the basal plane, the angle between which and
the prism faces is 77° 6'; the angles between these three cleavages thus
approximate to the angles (74° 55') between the three cleavages of calcite,
and there are other points of superficial resemblance between these two
minerals. Chemically, barytocalcite is a double salt of barium and calcium
carbonates, BaCa(CO_3)_2, thus differing from the orthorhombic bromlite
(_q.v._) which is an isomorphous mixture of the two carbonates.
