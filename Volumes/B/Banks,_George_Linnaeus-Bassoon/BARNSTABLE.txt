BARNSTABLE, a seaport township and the county-seat of the county of the
same name, in Massachusetts, U.S.A. Pop. (1900) 4364, of whom 391 were
foreign-born; (1910, U.S. census) 4676. Barnstable is served by the New
York, New Haven & Hartford Railway. It is situated between Cape Cod Bay on
the N. and Nantucket Sound on the S., extending across Cape Cod. The soil
of the township, unlike that of other parts of the county, is well adapted
to agriculture, and the principal industry is the growing of vegetables and
the supplying of milk and poultry for its several villages, nearly all of
which are summer resorts. At Hyannis is a state normal school (1897;
co-educational). Cranberries are raised in large quantities, and there are
oyster and other shell fisheries. In the 17th century the mackerel and
whale fisheries were the basis of economic life; the latter gave way later
to the cod and other fisheries, but the fishing industry is now relatively
unimportant. Much of the county is a region of sands, salt-marshes,
beach-grass and scattered woods. From 1865 to 1895 the county diminished
20.1% in population. Barnstable was settled and incorporated in 1639
(county created 1685), and includes among its natives James Otis and Lemuel
Shaw.
