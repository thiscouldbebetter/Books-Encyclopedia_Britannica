BARKER'S MILL, a mechanical contrivance invented by a Dr Barker about the
end of the 17th century. It consisted of a hollow vertical cylinder,
provided with a number of horizontal arms fitted with lateral apertures;
the contrivance is mounted so as to rotate about the vertical axis. By
allowing water to enter the vertical tube, a rotation, due to the discharge
through the lateral orifices, is set up.
