BARROIS, CHARLES (1851- ), French geologist, was born at Lille on the 21st
of April 1851, and educated at the college in that town, where he studied
geology under Prof. Jules Gosselet and qualified as D. ès Sc. To this
master he dedicated his first comprehensive work, _Recherches sur le
terrain crétacé supérieur de l'Angleterre et de l'Irlande_, published in
the _Mémoires de la société géologique du Nord_ in 1876. In this essay the
palaeontological zones in the Chalk and Upper Greensand of Britain were for
the first time marked out in detail, and the results of Dr Barrois's
original researches have formed the basis of subsequent work, and have in
all leading features been confirmed. In 1876 Dr Barrois was appointed a
collaborateur to the French Geological Survey, and in 1877 professor of
geology in the university [v.03 p.0439] of Lille. In other memoirs, among
which may be mentioned those on the Cretaceous rocks of the Ardennes and of
the Basin of Oviedo, Spain; on the (Devonian) Calcaire d'Erbray; on the
Palaeozoic rocks of Brittany and of northern Spain; and on the granitic and
metamorphic rocks of Brittany, Dr Barrois has proved himself an
accomplished petrologist as well as palaeontologist and field-geologist. In
1881 he was awarded the Bigsby medal, and in 1901 the Wollaston medal by
the Geological Society of London. He was chosen member of the Institute
(Academy of Sciences) in 1904.
