BARONY, the domain of a baron (_q.v._). In Ireland counties are divided
into "baronies," which are equivalent to the "hundreds" (_q.v._) in
England, and seem to have been formed out of the territories of the Irish
chiefs, as each submitted to English rule (General Report of the Census of
England, iv. 181, 1873). In Scotland the term is applied to any large
freehold estate even when held by a commoner. Barony also denotes the rank
or dignity of a baron, and the feudal tenure "by barony."
