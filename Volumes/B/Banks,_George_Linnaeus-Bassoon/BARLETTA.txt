BARLETTA (anc. _Barduli_), a seaport town and episcopal see of Apulia,
Italy, on the E.S.E. coast, in the province of Bari, 34½ m. W.N.W. of Bari
by rail. Pop. (1901) 42,022. Its importance dates from the time of the
Hohenstaufen. The Gothic church of S. Sepolcro was built at the close of
the 12th century, and the Romanesque cathedral was begun at the same
period, but added to later. In front of the former church stands a bronze
statue, 14 ft. in height, of the emperor Heraclius. The castle behind the
cathedral dates from 1537. The harbour is good. It was cleared by 508
sailing-vessels and 461 steamers, the latter with a total tonnage of
364,904 in 1904; the exports were of the value of £180,699 (principally
wine, sulphur, oil, tartar and tartaric acid), and the imports £92,486
(coal, timber and sundries).

In the neighbourhood (between Andria and Corato), during the siege of
Barletta by the French in 1503, the town being defended by the Spanish
army, a combat took place between thirteen picked knights of Italy and
France, which resulted in favour of the former: it has been celebrated by
Massimo d' Azeglio in his _Disfida di Barletta_. Seven miles to the N.W.
are the salt-works of Barletta, now known under the name of Margherita di
Savoia.
