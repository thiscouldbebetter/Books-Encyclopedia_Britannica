BARNIM XI. (1501-1573), son of Bogislaus X., duke of Pomerania, became duke
on his father's death in 1523. He ruled for a time in common with his elder
brother George; and after George's death in 1531 he shared the duchy with
his nephew Philip I., retaining for himself the duchy of Pomerania-Stettin.
The earlier years of his rule were troubled by a quarrel with the margrave
of Brandenburg, who wished to annex Pomerania. In 1529, however, a treaty
was made which freed Pomerania from the supremacy of Brandenburg on
condition that if the ducal family became extinct the duchy should revert
to Brandenburg. Barnim adopted the doctrines of Martin Luther, and joined
the league of Schmalkalden, but took no part in the subsequent war. But as
this attitude left him without supporters he was obliged to submit to the
emperor Charles V., to pay a heavy fine, and to accept the _Interim_,
issued from Augsburg in May 1548. In 1569 Barnim handed over his duchy to
his grand-nephew, John Frederick, and died at Stettin on the 2nd of June
1573.
