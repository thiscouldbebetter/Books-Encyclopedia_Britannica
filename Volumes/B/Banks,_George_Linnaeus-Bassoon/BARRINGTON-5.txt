BARRINGTON, SHUTE (1734-1826), youngest son of the 1st Viscount Barrington,
was educated at Eton and Oxford, and after holding some minor dignities was
made bishop of Llandaff in 1769. In 1782 he was translated to Salisbury and
in 1791 to Durham. He was a vigorous Protestant, though willing to grant
Roman Catholics "every degree of toleration short of political power and
establishment." He published several volumes of sermons and tracts, and
wrote the political life of his brother, Viscount Barrington.
