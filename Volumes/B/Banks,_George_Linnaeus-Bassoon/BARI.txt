BARI, a tribe of Nilotic negroes, living on the banks of the upper Nile
some 200 m. N. of Albert Nyanza. They have as neighbours the Dinka to the
north, the Madi to the south, and the Galla to the east. The men are tall
and thin, the women fat and under middle height. Their colour is a deep
dead brown. The men and unmarried girls go practically naked, the married
women wearing a goatskin dyed red. The body is ornamented with red clay and
the lower incisors are often extracted. Their sole wealth is cattle and
their chief food milk and blood; meat is only eaten when a cow happens to
die. They live in round grass huts with conical roofs. Twins are considered
unlucky, the mother is divorced by her husband and her family must refund
part of the marriage-price. The dead are buried in the hut; a square grave
is dug in which the body is arranged in a sitting position with the hands
tied behind the back. The most important men in the country are the
rainmakers, who are reverenced even more than the chiefs, and, indeed, are
famous among the surrounding tribes. The Bari warriors have been much
recruited for the Egyptian army and were formerly used as slave-hunters by
the Arab traders.
