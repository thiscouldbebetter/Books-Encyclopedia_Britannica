BARRY, ELIZABETH (1658-1713), English actress, of whose early life the
details are meagre. At first she was so unsuccessful on the stage as to be
more than once dismissed; but she was coached by her lover the earl of
Rochester, who had laid a wager that in a short time he would make a
first-rate actress of her, and the results confirmed his judgment. Mrs
Barry's performance as Isabella, queen of Hungary, in the earl of Orrery's
_Mustapha_, was said to have caused Charles II. and the duke and duchess of
York so much delight that the duchess took lessons in English from her, and
when she became queen she gave Mrs Barry her coronation robes in which to
appear as Elizabeth in Banks's _Earl of Essex_. Mrs Barry is said to have
created over 100 parts, and she was particularly successful in the plays of
Thomas Otway. Betterton says that her acting gave "success to plays that
would disgust the most patient reader." Dryden pronounced her "always
excellent." Cibber is authority for the statement that it was on her behalf
that benefits, which up to that time were reserved for authors, were first
established for actors by command of James II. Mrs Barry had a child by
Lord Rochester and a second by Sir George Etheredge, both of whom were
provided for by their fathers. In 1709 she retired from the stage and died
on the 7th of November 1713.
