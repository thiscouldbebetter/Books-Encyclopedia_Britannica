BARNARD, LADY ANNE (1750-1825), author of the ballad "Auld Robin Gray," the
eldest daughter of James Lindsay, 5th earl of Balcarres, was born at
Balcarres House, Fife, on the 12th of December 1750. She was married in
1793 to Andrew Barnard, a son of the bishop of Limerick, for whom she
obtained from Henry Dundas (1st Viscount Melville) an appointment as
colonial secretary at the Cape of Good Hope. Thither the Barnards went in
March 1797, Lady Anne remaining at the Cape until January 1802. A
remarkable series of letters written by Lady Anne thence to Dundas, then
secretary for war and the colonies, was published in 1901 under the title
_South Africa a Century Ago_. In 1806, on the reconquest of the Cape by the
British, Barnard was reappointed colonial secretary, but Lady Anne did not
accompany him thither, where he died in 1807. The rest of her life was
passed in London, where she died on the 6th of May 1825. "Auld Robin Gray"
was written by her in 1772, to music by the Rev. William Leeves
(1748-1828), as he admitted in 1812. It was published anonymously in 1783,
Lady Anne only acknowledging the authorship of the words two years before
her death in a letter to Sir Walter Scott, who subsequently edited it for
the Bannatyne Club with two continuations.

Robin Gray," prefixed to _South Africa a Century Ago_.
