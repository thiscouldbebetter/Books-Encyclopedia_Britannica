BARENTS, WILLEM (d. 1597), Dutch navigator, was born about the middle of
the 16th century. In 1594 he left Amsterdam with two ships to search for a
north-east passage to eastern Asia. He reached the west coast of Novaya
Zemlya, and followed it northward, being finally forced to turn back when
near its northern extremity. In the following year he commanded another
expedition of seven ships, which made for the strait between the Asiatic
coast and Vaygach Island, but was too late to find open water; while his
third journey equally failed of its object and resulted in his death. On
this occasion he had two ships, and on the outward journey sighted Bear
Island and Spitsbergen, where the ships separated. Barents' vessel, after
rounding the north of Novaya Zemlya, was beset by ice and he was compelled
to winter in the north; and as his ship was not released early in 1597, his
party left her in two open boats on the 13th of June and most of its
members escaped. Barents himself, however, died on the 30th of June 1597.
In 1871 the house in which he wintered was discovered, with many relics,
which are preserved at the Hague, and in 1875 part of his journal was
found.
