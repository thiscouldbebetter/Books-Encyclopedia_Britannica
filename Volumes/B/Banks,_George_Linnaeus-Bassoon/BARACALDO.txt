BARACALDO, a river-port of north-eastern Spain, in the province of Biscay;
on the left bank of the river Nervion or Ansa (in Basque, Ibaizabal), 5 m.
by rail N.W. of Bilbao. Pop. (1900) 15,013. Few Spanish towns have
developed more rapidly than Baracaldo, which nearly doubled its population
between 1880 and 1900. During this period many immigrant labourers settled
here; for the ironworks and dynamite factory of Baracaldo prospered
greatly, owing to the increased output of the Biscayan mines, the extension
of railways in the neighbourhood, and the growth of shipping at Bilbao. The
low flat country round Baracaldo is covered with maize, pod fruit and
vines.
