BARRICADE, or BARRICADO (from the Span. _barricada_, from _barrica_, a
cask, casks filled with earth having been early used to form barricades),
an improvised fortification of earth, paving-stones, trees or any materials
ready to hand, thrown up, especially across a street, to hinder the advance
of an enemy; in the old wooden warships a fence or wooden rail, supported
by stanchions and strengthened by various materials, extending across the
quarter-deck as a protection during action.
