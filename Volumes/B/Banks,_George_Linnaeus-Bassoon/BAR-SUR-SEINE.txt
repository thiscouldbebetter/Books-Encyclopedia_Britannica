BAR-SUR-SEINE, a town of eastern France, capital of an arrondissement in
the department of Aube, on the left bank of the Seine, 20 m. S.E. of Troyes
by the Eastern railway. Pop. (1906) 2812. The town lies at the foot of a
wooded hill on which stand the ruins of the castle of the counts of Bar,
and is composed chiefly of one long street, bordered in places by houses of
the 16th century. Its principal building is the church of St Etienne, of
the 16th and 17th centuries, which contains some fine stained glass.
Bar-sur-Seine has a sub-prefecture and a tribunal of first instance.
Tanning, dyeing, flour-milling, brandy-distilling and the manufacture of
glass are among the industries. The Canal de la Haute-Seine begins at this
point. The town was devastated in 1359 by the English, when, according to
Froissart, no fewer than 900 mansions were burnt. Afterwards it suffered
greatly in the religious wars of the 16th century.
