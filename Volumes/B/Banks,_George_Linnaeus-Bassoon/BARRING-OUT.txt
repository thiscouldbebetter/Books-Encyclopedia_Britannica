BARRING-OUT, a custom, formerly common in English schools, of barring the
master out of the school premises. A typical example of this practice was
at Bromfield school, Cumberland, where William Hutchinson says "it was the
custom, time out of mind, for the scholars, at Fasting's Even (the
beginning of Lent) to depose and exclude the master from the school for
three days." During this period the school doors were barricaded and the
boys armed with mock weapons. If the master's attempts to re-enter were
successful, extra tasks were inflicted as a penalty, and willingly
performed by the boys. On the third day terms of capitulation, usually in
Latin verse, were signed, and these always conceded the immediate right to
indulge in football and a cockfight. The custom was long retained at Eton
and figures in many school stories.
