BASILISK (the [Greek: Basiliskos] of the Greeks, and _Tsepha_ (cockatrice)
of the Hebrews), a name given by the ancients to a horrid monster of their
own imagination, to which they attributed the most malignant powers and an
equally fiendish appearance. The term is now applied, owing to a certain
fanciful resemblance, to a genus of lizards belonging to the family
_Iguanidae_, the species of which are characterized by the presence, in the
males, of an erectile crest on the head, and a still higher, likewise
erectile crest--beset with scales--on the back, and another on the long
tail. _Basiliscus americanus_ reaches the length of one yard; its colour is
green and brown, with dark crossbars, while the crest is reddish. This
beautiful, strictly herbivorous creature is rather common amidst the
luxuriant vegetation on the banks of rivers and streams of the Atlantic hot
lands of Mexico and Guatemala. The lizards lie upon the branches of trees
overhanging the water, into which they plunge at the slightest alarm. Then
they propel themselves by rapid strokes of the hind limbs, beating the
water in a semi-erect position and letting the long rudder-like tail drag
behind. They are universally known as _pasa-rios_, _i.e._ ferrymen.
