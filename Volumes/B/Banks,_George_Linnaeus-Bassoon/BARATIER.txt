BARATIER, JOHANN PHILIPP (1721-1740), German scholar of precocious genius,
was born at Schwabach near Nuremberg on the 10th of January 1721. His early
education was most carefully conducted by his father, the pastor of the
French church at Schwabach, and so rapid was his progress that by the time
he was five years of age he could speak French, Latin and Dutch with ease,
and read Greek fluently. He then studied Hebrew, and in three years was
able to translate the Hebrew Bible into Latin or French. He collected
materials for a dictionary of rare and difficult Hebrew words, with
critical and philological observations; and when he was about eleven years
old translated from the Hebrew Tudela's _Itinerarium_. In his fourteenth
year he was admitted master of arts at Halle, and received into the Royal
Academy at Berlin. The last years of his short life he devoted to the study
of history and antiquities, and had collected materials for histories of
the Thirty Years' War and of Antitrinitarianism, and for an _Inquiry
concerning Egyptian Antiquities_. His health, which had always been weak,
gave way completely under these labours, and he died on the 5th of October
1740. He had published eleven separate works, and left a great quantity of
manuscript.
