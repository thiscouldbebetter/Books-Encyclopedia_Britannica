BARTON-UPON-HUMBER, a market town in the N. Lindsey or Brigg parliamentary
division of Lincolnshire, England, the terminus of a branch of the Great
Central railway, 44 m. N. by E. of Lincoln. Pop. of urban district (1901)
5671. It lies beneath low hills, on flat ground bordering the Humber, but
the centre of the town is a mile from the river. The church of St Peter has
a remarkable west tower of pre-Conquest workmanship, excepting the early
Norman top storey. Against the western face is a low building of the date
of the lower tower-storeys, measuring 15 ft. by 12, with rude,
deeply-splayed windows. The tower itself is arcaded in the two lower
storeys, having round arches in the lower and triangular in the upper, and
there is a round-headed S. doorway and a triangular-headed N. doorway. The
rest of the church is Decorated and Perpendicular. The church of St Mary is
fine Early English with Perpendicular clerestory. Industries include
brick-making, malting, and rope-making. Barton appears in Domesday, when
the ferry over the Humber existed. As a port, moreover, it subsequently
rose into some importance, for it was able to supply eight ships and men to
the expedition of Edward III. to Brittany.
