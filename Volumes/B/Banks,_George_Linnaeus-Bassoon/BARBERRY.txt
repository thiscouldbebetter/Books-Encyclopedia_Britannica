BARBERRY (_Berberis vulgaris_), a shrub with spiny-toothed leaves, which on
the woody shoots are reduced to forked spines, and pale yellow flowers in
hanging racemes, which are succeeded by orange-red berries. It is a member
of the botanical natural order _Berberidaceae_, and contains about 100
species in the north temperate zone and in the Andes of South America
extending into Patagonia. The order is nearly allied to the buttercup order
in having the parts of the flowers all free and arranged in regular
succession below the ovary which consists of only one carpel. It is
distinguished by having the sepals, petals and stamens in multiples of 2, 3
or 4, never of 5. The berries of _Berberis_ are edible; those of the native
barberry are sometimes made into preserves. The alkaloid berberine (_q.v._)
occurs in the roots.
