BARABOO, a city and the county-seat of Sauk county, Wisconsin, U.S.A.,
about 37 m. N.W. of Madison, on the Baraboo river, a tributary of the
Wisconsin. Pop. (1890) 4605; (1900) 5751, of whom 732 were foreign-born;

railway, which maintains here an engine house and extensive machine shops,
and of which it is a division headquarters. Baraboo has an attractive
situation on a series of hills about 1000 ft. above sea-level. In the
vicinity are Devil's Lake (3 m. S.) and the famous Dells of the Wisconsin
river (near Kilbourn, about 12 m. N.), two summer resorts with picturesque
scenery. The principal public buildings are the court-house (in a small
public park), the public library and a high school. Dairying and the
growing of small fruits are important industries in the surrounding region;
and there is a large nursery here. Stone quarried in the vicinity is
exported, and the city is near the centre of the Sauk county iron range.
Among the manufactures are woollen goods, towels, canned fruit and
vegetables, dairy products, beer, and circus wagons (the city is the
headquarters of the Ringling and the Gollmar circuses). The first permanent
settlement here was made in 1839. Baraboo was named in honour of Jean
Baribault, an early French trapper, and was chartered as a city in 1882.
