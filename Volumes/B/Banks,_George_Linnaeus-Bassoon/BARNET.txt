BARNET, a residential district in the mid or St Albans parliamentary
division of Hertfordshire, England; 10 m. N. of London, served by the main
line and branches of the Great Northern railway. The three chief divisions
are as follows:--(1) CHIPPING or HIGH BARNET, a market town and urban
district (Barnet), pop. (1901) 7876. The second epithet designates its
position on a hill, but the first is given it from the market granted to
the abbots of St Albans to be kept there, by Henry II. Near the town, round
a point marked by an obelisk, was fought in 1471 the decisive battle
between the houses of York and Lancaster, in which the earl of Warwick fell
and the Lancastrians were totally defeated. The town is on the Great North
Road, on which it was formerly an important coaching station. A large
annual horse and cattle fair is held. (2) EAST BARNET, 2 m. S.E. of
Chipping Barnet, has an ancient parish church retaining Norman portions,
though enlarged in modern times. Pop. of East Barnet Valley urban district,
10,094. (3) NEW BARNET lies 1 m. E. by S. from Chipping Barnet.

FRIERN BARNET, in the Enfield parliamentary division of Middlesex, lies 3
m. S. of Chipping Barnet. Pop. of urban district, 11,566. The prefix
recalls the former lordship of the manor possessed by the friary of St John
of Jerusalem in Clerkenwell, London. Friern Barnet adjoins Finchley on the
north and Whetstone on the south, the whole district being residential.
