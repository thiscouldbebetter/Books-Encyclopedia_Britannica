BARRILI, ANTONIO GIULIO (1836- ), Italian novelist, was born at Savona, and
was educated for the legal profession, which he abandoned for journalism in
Genoa. He was a volunteer in the campaign of 1859 and served with Garibaldi
in 1866 and 1867. From 1865 (_Capitan Dodero_) onwards he published a large
number of books of fiction, which had wide popularity, his work being
commonly compared with that of Victor Cherbuliez. Some of the best of the
later ones are _Santa Cecilia_ (1866), _Come un Sogno_ (1875), and _L'Olmo
e l' Edera_ (1877). His _Raggio di Dio_ appeared in 1899. Barrili also
wrote two plays and various volumes of criticism, including _Il
rinnovamento letterario italiano_ (1890). He was elected to the Italian
chamber of deputies in 1876; and in 1889 became professor of Italian
literature at Genoa.
