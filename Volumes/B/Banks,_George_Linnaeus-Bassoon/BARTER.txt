BARTER (from Fr. _barater_, to truck, to exchange), the exchange of
commodities for commodities, in contra-distinction to the exchange of
commodities for money. Barter was the simplest form of trading among
primitive communities, but its inconveniences led, at an early stage of
civilization, to the adoption of metals as mediums of exchange. Barter,
however, is still very common in dealings with uncivilized peoples, and
traders in many countries find that the most satisfactory method of
effecting exchange is to furnish themselves with such commodities as
weapons, tools and ornaments, which are more readily taken than money.

For the history of barter and the steps by which a system of currency was
gradually evolved, see MONEY. Consult also W. S. Jevons, _Money and the
Mechanism of Exchange_; A. Marshall, _Economics_; W. Ridgeway, _Origin of
Currency and Weight Standards._
