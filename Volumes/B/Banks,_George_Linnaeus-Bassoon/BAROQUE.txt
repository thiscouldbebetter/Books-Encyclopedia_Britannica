BAROQUE, a technical term, chiefly applicable to architecture, furniture
and household decoration. Apparently of Spanish origin--a _barrueco_ is a
large, irregularly-shaped pearl--the word was for a time confined to the
craft of the jeweller. It indicates the more extravagant fashions of design
that were common in the first half of the 18th century, chiefly in Italy
and France, in which everything is fantastic, grotesque, florid or
incongruous--irregular shapes, meaningless forms, an utter lack of
restraint and simplicity. The word suggests much the same order of ideas as
rococo.
