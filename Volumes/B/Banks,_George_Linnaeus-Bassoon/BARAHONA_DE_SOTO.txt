BARAHONA DE SOTO, LUIS (1535?-1595), Spanish poet, was born about 1535 at
Lucena (Cordova), was educated at Granada, and practised as a physician at
Cordova. His principal poem is the _Primera parte de la Angélica_ (1586), a
continuation of the _Orlando furioso_; the second part was long believed to
be lost, but fragments of it have been identified in the anonymous
_Diálogos de la monteria_, first printed in 1890; the _Diálogos_ also
embody fragments of a poem by Barahona entitled _Los Principios del mundo_,
and many graceful lyrics by the same writer have been published by
Francisco Rodriguez Marín. Cervantes describes Barahona as "one of the best
poets not only in Spain, but in the whole world"; this is friendly
hyperbole. Nevertheless Barahona has high merits: poetic imagination,
ingenious fancy, and an exceptional mastery of the methods transplanted to
Spain from Italy. His _Angélica_ has been reproduced in facsimile (New
York, 1904) by Archer M. Huntington.
