BARCLAY, JOHN (1734-1798), Scottish divine, was born in Perthshire and died
at Edinburgh. He graduated at St Andrews, and after being licensed became
assistant to the parish minister of Errol in Perthshire. Owing to
differences with the minister, he left in 1763 and was appointed assistant
to Antony Dow of Fettercairn, Kincardine. In this parish he became very
popular, but his opinions failed to give satisfaction to his presbytery. In
1772 he was rejected as successor to Dow, and was even refused by the
presbytery the testimonials requisite in order to obtain another living.
The refusal of the presbytery was sustained by the General Assembly, and
Barclay thereupon left the Scottish church and founded congregations at
Sauchyburn, Edinburgh and London. His followers were sometimes called
Bereans, because they regulated their conduct by a diligent study of the
Scriptures (Acts xvii. 11). They hold a modified form of Calvinism.

His works, which include many hymns and paraphrases of the psalms, and a
book called _Without Faith, without God_, were edited by J. Thomson and D.
Macmillan, with a memoir (1852).
