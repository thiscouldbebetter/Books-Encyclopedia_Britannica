BARTOLI, DANIELLO (1608-1685), Italian Jesuit priest, was born at Ferrara
and entered the Society of Jesus in 1623. Debarred from the foreign mission
field, he attained high distinction as a preacher and as a teacher of
rhetoric in Genoa, Florence and Rome. He wrote (in Italian) a book called
_The Learned Man_ as a counterblast to the widespread reading of romances,
and also a history of his order in 6 vols. (Rome, 1650-1673), which is
particularly informing with regard to the early work of the society in
Asia. He died at Rome.

A collected edition of his works, in 12 vols., was published by Marietti at
Turin, 1825-1856; another in 50 vols. at Florence in 1826.
