BARBON, NICHOLAS (_c._ 1640-1698), English economist, probably the son of
Praise-god Barbon, was born in London, studied medicine at Leiden,
graduated M.D. at Utrecht in 1661, and was admitted an honorary fellow of
the College of Physicians in 1664. He took a considerable part in the
rebuilding of London after the great fire of 1666, and has a claim to be
considered the institutor of fire-insurance in England, which he started
somewhere about 1680. He was M.P. for Bramber in 1690 and 1695. He founded
a land bank which, according to contemporaries, was fairly successful and
was united with that of John Briscoe in 1696. He died in 1698. His writings
are interesting as expressing views much in advance of his time and very
near akin to those of modern times on such important topics as value, rent
and foreign trade. The more important were _Apology for the Builder; or a
Discourse showing the Cause and Effects of the Increase of Building_
(1685); _A Discourse of Trade_ (1690); and _A Discourse Concerning Coining
the New Money Lighter_ (1696).
