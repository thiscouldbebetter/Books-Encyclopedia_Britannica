BARLEY-BREAK, an old English country game frequently mentioned by the poets
of the 17th and 18th centuries. It was played by three pairs composed of
one of each sex, who were stationed in three bases or plots, contiguous to
each other. The couple occupying the middle base, called _hell_ or
_prison_, endeavoured to catch the other two, who, when chased, might
_break_ to avoid being caught. If one was overtaken, he and his companion
were condemned to _hell_. From this game was taken the expression "the last
couple in hell," often used in old plays.
