BARTIZAN (according to the _New English Dictionary_, from _bertizene_, a
Scottish corruption of "bratticing" or "brattishing," from O. Fr.
_bretesche_, and meaning a battlemented parapet; apparently first used by
Sir Walter Scott), a small battlemented turret, corbelled out at the angle
of a wall or tower to protect a warder and enable him to see around him.
Bartizans generally are furnished with oylets or arrow-slits.
