BARTHÉLEMY, FRANÇOIS, MARQUIS DE (1747 or 1750-1830), French politician,
was educated by his uncle the abbé Jean Jacques Barthélemy for a diplomatic
career, and after serving as secretary of legation in Sweden, in
Switzerland and in England, was appointed minister plenipotentiary in
Switzerland, in which capacity he negotiated the treaties of Basel with
Prussia and Spain (1795). Elected a member of the Directory in May 1797,
through royalist influence, he was arrested at the _coup d'état_ of the 18
Fructidor (17th of September 1797) and deported to French Guiana, but
escaped and made his way to the United States and then to England. He
returned to France after the 18 Brumaire, entered the senate in February
1800 and contributed to the establishment of the consulship for life and
the empire. In 1814 he abandoned Napoleon, took part in the drawing up of
the constitutional charter and was named peer of France. During the Hundred
Days he lived in concealment, and after the second Restoration obtained the
title marquis, and in 1819 introduced a motion in the chamber of peers
tending to render the electoral law more aristocratic.

His _Papiers_ have been published by J. Kaulek, 4 vols. (Paris, 1886-1888).
