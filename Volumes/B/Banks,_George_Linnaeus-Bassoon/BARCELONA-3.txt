BARCELONA, a town and port of Venezuela, capital of the state of Bermudez,
on the Neveri river, 3 m. from its mouth and 12 m. by rail from the port of
Guanta, which has superseded the incommodious river port in the trade of
this district. Pop. (est. 1904) 13,000. Built on the border of a low plain
and having a mean annual temperature of 82° F., the town has the reputation
of being unhealthy. There are salt works and important coal deposits in its
vicinity, the latter at Naricual and Capiricual, 12 m. distant by rail.
Though the adjacent country is fertile, its prosperity has greatly
declined, and the exports of coffee, sugar, cacao and forest products are
much less important than formerly. The town dates from 1637, when it was
located at the foot of the Cerro Santo and was called Nueva Barcelona; it
reached a state of much prosperity and commercial importance before the end
of the century. The War of Independence, however, and the chronic political
disorders that followed nearly ruined its industries and trade.
