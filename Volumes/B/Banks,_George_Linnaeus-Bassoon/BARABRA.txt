BARABRA, a name for the complex Nubian races of the Egyptian Sudan, whose
original stock is Hamitic-Berber, long modified by negro crossings. The
word is variously derived from _Berberi_, _i.e._ people of Berber, or as
identical with _Barabara_, figuring in the inscription on a gateway of
Tethmosis I. as the name of one of the 113 tribes conquered by him. In a
later inscription of Rameses II. at Karnak (_c._ 1300 B.C.) _Beraberata_ is
given as that of a southern conquered people. Thus it is suggested that
Barabra is a real ethnical name, confused later with Greek and Roman
_barbarus_, and revived in its proper meaning subsequent to the Moslem
conquest. A tribe living on the banks of the Nile between Wadi Haifa and
Assuan are called Barabra. (See further NUBIA.)
