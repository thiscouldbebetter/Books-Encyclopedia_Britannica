BARTON BEDS, in geology, the name given to a series of softish grey and
brown clays, with layers of sand, of Upper Eocene age, which are found in
the Hampshire Tertiary basin, where they are particularly well exposed in
the cliffs of Barton, Hordwell, and in the Isle of Wight. Above the highly
fossiliferous Barton Clay there is a sandy series with few fossils; these
are the Headon Hill or Barton Sands. Either of these names is preferable to
the term "Upper Bagshot Beds," which has been applied to these sands. The
Barton Beds are absent from the London basin, and the Upper Bagshot Sands
of that area are probably at a lower horizon than the Barton Sands. The
term "Bartonien" was introduced by Mayer-Eymar in 1857 for the continental
equivalents of the series.

_Fusus longaevus_, _Volutilithes luctatrix_, _Ostrea gigantea_,
_Pectunculus (Glycimeris) deleta_ are characteristic fossils; fishes
(_Lamna_, _Arius_, &c.) and a crocodile (_Diplocynodon_) are also found in
the Barton Clay. The sands are very pure and are used in glass making.
