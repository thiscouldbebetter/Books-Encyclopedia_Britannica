BARTET (REGNAULT), JEANNE JULIA (1854- ), French actress, was born in Paris
and trained at the Conservatoire. In 1872 she began a successful career at
the Vaudeville, and in 1879 was engaged at the Comédie Francaise, of which
she became a _sociétaire_ in 1880. For many years she played the chief
parts both in tragedy and comedy, her grand style and exquisite finesse
making her supreme among the younger actresses on the French stage. She had
a season in London in 1908, when her consummate art was displayed in a
number of parts.
