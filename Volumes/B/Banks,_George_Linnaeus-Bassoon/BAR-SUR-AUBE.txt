BAR-SUR-AUBE, a town of north-eastern France, capital of an arrondissement
in the department of Aube, 34 m. E. by S. of Troyes on the main line of the
Eastern railway between that town and Belfort. Pop. (1906) 4276.
Bar-sur-Aube lies at the foot of hills on the right bank of the Aube at its
confluence with the Bresse. A circle of boulevards occupies the site of the
old ramparts, fragments of which still remain. Of the ecclesiastical
buildings, the most noteworthy are St Pierre and St Maclou, both dating
mainly from the end of the 12th century. St Pierre has wooden exterior
galleries and two fine Gothic porches. The sacristy of St Maclou is
conjectured to have formed the chapel of the castle of the counts of Bar,
of which the square tower flanking the north side of the church formed the
entrance. The town is the seat of a sub-prefect, and the public
institutions include a tribunal of first instance and a communal college.
Flour-milling, tanning, and the manufacture of brandy, hosiery and
agricultural implements are carried on. The wine of the district is much
esteemed.

Traces of a Roman settlement have been found on hills to the south of the
town. Under the domination of the counts of Champagne, it became the scene
of important fairs which did not cease till 1648. In 1814 several actions
between the French and the army of the allies took place at Bar-sur-Aube
(see NAPOLEONIC WARS).
