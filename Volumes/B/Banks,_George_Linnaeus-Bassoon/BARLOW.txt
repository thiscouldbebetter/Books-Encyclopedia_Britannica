BARLOW, SIR GEORGE HILARO (1762-1847), Anglo-Indian statesman, was
appointed to the Bengal Civil Service in 1778, and in 1788 carried into
execution the permanent settlement of Bengal. When the marquess of
Cornwallis died in 1805, Sir George Barlow was nominated provisional
governor-general, and his passion for economy and retrenchment in that
capacity has caused him to be known as the only governor-general who
diminished the area of British territory; but his nomination was rejected
by the home government, and Lord Minto was appointed. Subsequently Barlow
was created governor of Madras, where his want of tact caused a mutiny of
officers in 1809, similar to that which had previously occurred under
Clive. In 1812 he was recalled, and lived in retirement until his death in
February 1847. He was created a baronet in 1803.
