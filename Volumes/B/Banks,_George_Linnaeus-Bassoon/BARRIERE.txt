BARRIÈRE, THÉODORE (1823-1877), French dramatist, was born in Paris in
1823. He belonged to a family of map engravers which had long been
connected with the war department, and spent nine years in that service
himself. The success of a vaudeville he had performed at the Beaumarchais
and which was immediately snapped up for the repertory of the Palais Royal,
showed him his real vocation. During the next thirty years he signed, alone
or in collaboration, over a hundred plays; among the most successful were:
_La Vie de bohème_ (1849), adapted from Henri Murger's book with the
novelist's help; _Manon Lescaut_ (1851); _Les Filles de marbre_ (1853);
_L'Héritage de Monsieur Plumet_ (1858); _Les Faux Bonshommes_ (1856) with
Ernest Capendu; _Malheureux vaincus_ (1865), which was forbidden by the
censor; _Le Gascon_ (1878). Barrière died in Paris on the 16th of October
1877.
