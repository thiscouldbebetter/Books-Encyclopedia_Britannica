BASHKALA, the chief town of a sanjak of the vilayet of Van in Asiatic
Turkey. It is a military station, situated at an elevation of 7500 ft.
above sea-level in the valley of the Great Zab river. It stands on the east
slope of lofty bare mountains, overlooking a wide valley on the farther
side of which flows the Zab. On a knoll above is a ruined fortress formerly
occupied by a Kurdish Bey. The population numbers some 10,000, principally
Kurds, but including 1500 Armenians and 1000 Jews. The place is important
as the centre of the Hakkiari sanjak, a very difficult mountain district to
the south-west containing numerous tribes of Kurds and Nestorian
Christians, and also the many Kurdish tribes along the Persian frontier.
The houses are well built of sun-dried brick, and the streets are wide and
fairly clean. Good smiths' and carpenters' work is [v.03 p.0466] done. The
bazaar is small, although a thriving trade is done with the mountain
districts. Owing to the great elevation the winter is extremely severe, and
the summer of short duration. Wheat, barley, millet and sesame are
cultivated on the plain, but fruit and vegetables have mostly to be
imported from Persia. Roads lead to Van, Urmia in Persia and Mosul through
the Nestorian country. The Kurd and Nestorian tribes in the wilder parts of
the Hakkiari Mountains are under slight government control, and are
permitted to pay tribute and given self-government in a large degree.
