BARNES, THOMAS (1785-1841), British journalist, was born about 1785.
Educated at Christ's Hospital and Pembroke College, Cambridge, he came to
London and soon joined the famous literary circle of which Hunt, Lamb and
Hazlitt were prominent members. Upon the retirement of Dr Stoddart in 1817
he was appointed editor of _The Times_, a position which he held until his
death, when he was succeeded by Delane. Lord Lyndhurst gave expression to a
very widely-held opinion when he described him as "the most powerful man in
the country." He died on the 7th of May 1841.
