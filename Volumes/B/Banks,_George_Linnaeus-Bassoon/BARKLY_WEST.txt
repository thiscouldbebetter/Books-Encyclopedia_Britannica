BARKLY WEST, a town of Cape province, South Africa, 21 m. N.W. of
Kimberley, capital of a district and of an electoral division of the same
name in Griqualand West. It is built on the right bank of the Vaal, here
spanned by a bridge. Pop. (1904) 1037. Originally called Klipdrift, the
town was the first founded by the diggers after the discovery in 1867 of
diamonds along the valley of the Vaal, and it had for some years a large
floating population. On the discovery of the "dry diggings" at Kimberley,
the majority of the diggers removed thither. Barkly West remains, however,
the centre of the alluvial diamonds industry. The diamonds of this district
are noted for their purity and lustre, and are generally associated with
other crystals--garnets, agates, quartz and chalcedonies.

Barkly West electoral division includes the whole of Griqualand West save
the Kimberley division. It is divided into the fiscal districts of Barkly
West, Hay and Herbert, with a total pop. (1904) of 48,388, of whom 12,170
are whites (see GRIQUALAND).
