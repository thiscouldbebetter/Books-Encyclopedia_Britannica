BARDILI, CHRISTOPH GOTTFRIED (1761-1808), German philosopher, was born at
Blaubeuren in Württemberg, and died at Stuttgart. His system has had little
influence in Germany; Reinhold (_q.v._) alone expounded it against the
attacks of Fichte and Schelling. Yet in some respects his ideas opened the
way for the later speculations of Schelling and Hegel. He dissented
strongly from the Kantian distinction between matter and form of thought,
and urged that philosophy should consider only thought in itself, pure
thought, the ground or possibility of being. The fundamental principle of
thought is, according to him, the law of identity; logical thinking is real
thinking. The matter upon which thought operated is in itself indefinite
and is rendered definite through the action of thought. Bardili worked out
his idea in a one-sided manner. He held that thought has in itself no power
of development, and ultimately reduced it to arithmetical computation. He
published _Grundriss der ersten Logik_ (Stuttgart, 1800); _Über die Gesetze
der Ideenassociation_ (Tübingen, 1796); _Briefe über den Ursprung der
Metaphysik_ (Altona, 1798); _Philos. Elementarlehre_ (Landshut, 1802-1806);
_Beiträge zur Beurteilung des gegenwärtigen Zustandes der Vernunftlehre_
(Landshut, 1803).
