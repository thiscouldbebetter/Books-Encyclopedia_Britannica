BAR, FRANÇOIS DE (1538-1606), French scholar, was born at Seizencourt, near
St Quentin, and having studied at the university of Paris entered the order
of St Benedict. He soon became prior of the abbey of Anchin, near
Pecquencourt, and passed much of his time in the valuable library of the
abbey, studying ecclesiastical history, especially that of Flanders. He
also made a catalogue of the manuscripts at Anchin and annotated many of
them. During the French Revolution his manuscripts passed to the library at
Douai. Bar died at Anchin on the 25th of March 1606.
