BARTELS, HANS VON (1856- ), German painter, was born in Hamburg, the son of
Dr N. F. F. von Bartels, a Russian government official. He studied first
under the marine painter R. Hardorff in Hamburg, then under C. Schweitzer
in Düsseldorf and C. Oesterley in Hamburg, and finally at the Berlin School
of Art. After travelling extensively, especially in Italy, he settled in
Munich in 1885 and was appointed professor of painting in 1891. An oil
painter of great power, he is one of the leading German water-colour
painters, mainly of marines and scenes of fishing life, painted with rude
vigour and a great display of technical skill. He excels in storm scenes
and in depicting the strong, healthy fishing-folk of the northern coasts.
He became an honorary member of leading English, German, Dutch, Belgian and
Austrian art societies. Among his principal works are:--"Sturmflut" (Berlin
Gallery); "Lonely Beach" (Hungarian National Gallery); "Potato
Harvest--Rügen" (Prague); "Storm--Bornholm" (German emperor's collection);
and "Moonlight on the Zuyder Zee" (New Pinakothek, Munich).
