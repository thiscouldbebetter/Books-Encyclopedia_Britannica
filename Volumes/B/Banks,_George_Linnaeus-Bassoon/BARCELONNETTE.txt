BARCELONNETTE, a town in the department of Basses-Alpes, in the S.E. of
France. Pop. (1906) 2075. It is built at a height of 3717 ft. on the right
bank of the Ubaye river, on which it is the most important place. It is
situated in a wide and very fertile valley, and is surrounded by many
villas, built by natives who have made their fortune in Mexico, and are
locally known as _les Américains_. The town itself is mainly composed of a
long street (flanked by two others), which is really the road from Grenoble
to Cuneo over the Col de l'Argentière (6545 ft.). The only remarkable
buildings in the town are a striking clock-tower of the 15th century (the
remains of a Franciscan convent) and the Musée Chabrand, which contains a
very complete collection of birds, both European and extra-European.

Refounded in 1231 by Raymond Bérenger IV., count of Provence (he was of the
family of the counts of Barcelona, whence the name of the town he rebuilt),
Barcelonnette passed to Savoy in 1388 (formal cession in 1419), and in 1713
by the treaty of Utrecht was ceded to France in exchange for the valleys of
Exilles, Fénestrelles, and Château Dauphin (Casteldelfino). It was the
birth-place of J. A. Manuel (1775-1827), the well-known Liberal orator at
the time of the Restoration of 1815, after whom the principal square of the
town is named.

(1898), and _La Vallée de Barcelonnette_ (1900).
