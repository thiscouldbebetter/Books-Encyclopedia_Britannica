BARBARA, SAINT, a virgin martyr and saint of the Roman Catholic and
Orthodox Eastern Churches, whose festival day is December 4th. Her legend
is that she was immured in a tower [v.03 p.0382] by her father who was
opposed to her marriage; that she was converted to Christianity by a
follower of Origen, and that when her father learnt this, he beheaded her.
The place of her martyrdom is variously given as Heliopolis, as a town of
Tuscany, and as Nicomedia, Bithynia, about the year 235. St Barbara is the
patron saint of armourers and gunsmiths, and her protection is sought
specially against lightning.
