BASEL, CONFESSION OF, one of the many statements of faith produced by the
Reformation. It was put out in 1534 and must be distinguished from the
First and Second Helvetic Confessions, its author being Oswald Myconius,
who based it on a shorter confession promulgated by Oecolampadius, his
predecessor in the church at Basel. Though it was an attempt to bring into
line with the reforming party both those who still inclined to the old
faith and the anabaptist section, its publication provoked a good deal of
controversy, especially on its statements concerning the Eucharist, and the
people of Strassburg even reproached those of Basel with celebrating a
Christless supper. Up to the year 1826 the Confession (sometimes also known
as the Confession of Mühlhausen from its adoption by that town) was
publicly read from the pulpits of Basel on the Wednesday of Passion week in
each year. In 1872 a resolution of the great council of the city
practically annulled it.
