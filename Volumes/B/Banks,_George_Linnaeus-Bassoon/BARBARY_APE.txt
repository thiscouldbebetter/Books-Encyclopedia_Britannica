BARBARY APE, a tailless monkey inhabiting Algeria, Morocco, and the rock of
Gibraltar (where it may have been introduced), and referable to the
otherwise Asiatic group of macaques, in which it alone represents the
subgenus _Inuus_. This monkey, _Macacus inuus_, is light yellowish-brown
above and yellowish-white below, with the naked part of the face
flesh-coloured. It is entirely terrestrial in habits, at least on
Gibraltar, and goes about in droves.
