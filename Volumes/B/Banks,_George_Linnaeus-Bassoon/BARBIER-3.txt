BARBIER, LOUIS, known as the ABBÉ DE LA RIVIÈRE (1593-1670), French bishop,
was born of humble parents in Vaudelaincourt, near Compiègne. He entered
the church and made his way by his wit and cleverness, until he was
appointed tutor, and then became the friend and adviser, of Gaston
d'Orléans, brother of Louis XIII. He thus gained an entrance to the court,
became grand almoner of the queen, and received the revenue of rich abbeys.
In March 1655 he was named bishop of Langres, but he spent his time at
court, where his wit was always in demand, and where he gained great sums
by gambling. He died very rich.
