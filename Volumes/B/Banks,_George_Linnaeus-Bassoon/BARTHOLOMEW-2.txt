BARTHOLOMEW, JOHN (1831-1893), Scottish cartographer, was born at Edinburgh
on the 25th of December 1831. His father had a cartographical establishment
there and he was educated in the work. He was subsequently assistant to the
German geographer August Petermann, until in 1856 he took up the management
of his father's firm. For this establishment, now known as the Edinburgh
Geographical Institute, Bartholomew built up a reputation unsurpassed in
Great Britain for the production of the finest cartographical work. Among
his numerous publications mention may be specially made of the series of
maps of Great Britain reduced from the Ordnance Survey to scales of ½ in.
and ¼ in. to 1 m., with relief shown by contours and a systematic scale of
colours. The ½ in. series, which was extended (and its principles applied
to many other works) by Mr. J. G. Bartholomew, who succeeded his father in
the business, is the finest of its kind ever produced. John Bartholomew
died in London on the 29th of March 1893.
