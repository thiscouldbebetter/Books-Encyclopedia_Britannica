BARATYNSKI, JEWGENIJ ABRAMOVICH (1800-1844), Russian poet, was educated at
the royal school at St Petersburg and then entered the army. He served for
eight years in Finland, where he composed his first poem _Eda_. Through the
interest of friends he obtained leave from the tsar to retire from the
army, and settled in 1827 near Moscow. There he completed his chief work
_The Gipsy_, a poem written in the style of Pushkin. He died in 1844 at
Naples, whither he had gone for the sake of the milder climate.

A collected edition of his poems appeared at St Petersburg, in 2 vols. in
1835; later editions, Moscow 1869, and Kazan 1884.
