BARQUISIMETO, a city of western Venezuela, capital of the state of Lara, on
the Barquisimeto river, 101 m. by rail S.W. of Tucacas, its port on the
Caribbean coast. Pop. (est. 1899) 40,000. It is built in a small, fertile
valley of the Merida Cordilleras, 1985 ft. above sea-level, has a
temperate, healthy climate with a mean annual temperature of 78° F., and is
surrounded by a highly productive country from which are exported coffee,
sugar, cacao and rum. It is also an important distributing centre for
neighbouring districts. The city is the seat of a bishopric, is regularly
laid out and well built, and is well provided with educational and
charitable institutions. Barquisimeto was founded in 1522 by Juan de
Villegas, who was exploring the neighbourhood for gold, and it was first
called Nueva Segovia after his native city. In 1807 its population had
risen to 15,000, principally through its commercial importance, but on the
26th of March 1812 it was totally destroyed by an earthquake, and with it
1500 lives, including a part of the revolutionary forces occupying the
town. It was soon rebuilt and is one of the few cities of Venezuela which
have recovered from the ravages of the war of independence and subsequent
disorders.
