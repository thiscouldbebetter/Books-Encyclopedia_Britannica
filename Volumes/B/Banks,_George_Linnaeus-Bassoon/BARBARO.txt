BARBARO, ERMOLAO (HERMOLAUS BARBARUS) (1454-1493), Italian scholar, was
born at Venice on the 21st of May 1454. At an early age he was sent to
Rome, where he studied under Pomponius Laetus. He completed his education
at the university of Padua, where he was appointed professor of philosophy
in 1477. Two years later he revisited Venice, but returned to Padua when
the plague broke out in his native city. He was sent on various missions to
persons of high rank, amongst them Pope Innocent VIII., by whom he was
nominated to the important office of patriarch of Aquileia (1491). The
Venetian senate, however, refused to ratify the appointment, which,
contrary to the law, he had accepted without first obtaining its sanction.
He was banished and forced to resign the patriarchate, under the threat of
being punished vicariously by the confiscation of his father's property.
Barbarus remained at Rome, in receipt of a small pension from the
pontifical government, until his death (probably from the plague) on the
14th of June 1493 (according to some, two years later). He edited and
translated a number of classical works, of which the most important were:
_Castigationes Plinianae_ (1492), in which he boasted of having made 5000
corrections in the text of Pliny's _Natural History_; Themistius'
_Paraphrases_ of certain works of Aristotle (1480); Aristotle's _Rhetorica_
(published in 1544); _Castigationes in Pomponium Melam_ (1493).
