BASSEIN, a district and town in the Irrawaddy division of Lower Burma, in
the delta of the Irrawaddy. The district has been reduced to 4127 sq. m.,
from 8954 sq. m. in 1871, having given up a large tract to the district of
Myaungmya formed in 1896.

A mountain range called the Anauk-pet Taungmyin stretches through the
district from N. to S. along the coast. The principal river of the district
is the Irrawaddy, which debouches on the sea at its eastern extremity
through a delta intersected with salt water creeks, among which the
Pyamalaw, Pyinzalu, Kyuntôn, and Ngawun Shagègyi or Bassein river rank as
important arms of the sea. Irrawaddy and Inyègyi are the only two lakes in
the district. The delta of the Irrawaddy forms, wherever cultivable, a vast
sheet of rice, with cotton, sesamum, and tobacco as subsidiary crops. In
1901 the population was 391,427.
