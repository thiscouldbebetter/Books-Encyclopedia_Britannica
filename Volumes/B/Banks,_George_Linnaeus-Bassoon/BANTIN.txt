BANTIN, or BANTING, the native name of the wild ox of Java, known to the
Malays as sapi-utan, and in zoology as _Bos (Bibos) sondaicus._ The white
patch on the rump distinguishes the bantin from its ally the gaur (_q.v._).
Bulls of the typical bantin of Java and Borneo are, when fully adult,
completely black except for the white rump and legs, but the cows and young
are rufous. In Burma the species is represented by the tsaine, or h'saine,
in which the colour of the adult bulls is rufous fawn. Tame bantin are bred
in Bali, near Java, and exported to Singapore. (See BOVIDAE.)
