BARBECUE (Span. _barbacoa_), originally a framework on posts placed over a
fire on which to dry or smoke meat; hence, a gridiron for roasting whole
animals, and in Cuba an upper floor on which fruit or grain is stored. In
the United States the word means an open-air feast, either political or
social, where whole animals are roasted and eaten and hogsheads of beer and
other vast quantities of food and drink consumed.
