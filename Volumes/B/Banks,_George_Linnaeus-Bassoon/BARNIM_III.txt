BARNIM III. (_c._ 1303-1368), called the _Great_, was the son of Otto I.,
duke of Pomerania-Stettin, and took a prominent part in the defence and
government of the duchy before his father's [v.03 p.0416] death in 1344. A
long and intermittent struggle with the representatives of the emperor
Louis IV., who had invested his own son Louis with the mark of Brandenburg,
enabled him to gain military experience and distinction. A victory gained
by him in August 1332 was mainly instrumental in freeing Pomerania for a
time from the vexatious claim of Brandenburg to supremacy over the duchy,
which moreover he extended by conquest. Barnim assisted the emperor Charles
IV. in his struggle with the family of Wittelsbach. He died on the 24th of
August 1368.
