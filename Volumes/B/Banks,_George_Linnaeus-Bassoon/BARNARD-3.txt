BARNARD, GEORGE GREY (1863- ), American sculptor, was born at Bellefonte,
Pennsylvania, on the 24th of May 1863. He first studied at the Art
Institute, Chicago, and in 1883-1887 worked in P. T. Cavelier's _atelier_
at Paris. He lived in Paris for twelve years, returning to America in 1896;
and with his first exhibit at the Salon of 1894 he scored a great success.
His principal works include, "The Boy" (1885); "Cain" (1886), later
destroyed; "Brotherly Love," sometimes called "Two Friends" (1887); the
allegorical "Two Natures" (1894, in the Metropolitan Museum, New York
City); "The Hewer" (1902, at Cairo, Illinois); "Great God Pan" (in Central
Park, New York City); the "Rose Maiden"; the simple and graceful
"Maidenhood"; and sculptural decorations for the new Capitol building for
the state of Pennsylvania at Harrisburg.
