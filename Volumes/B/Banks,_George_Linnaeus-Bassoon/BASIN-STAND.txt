BASIN-STAND, a piece of furniture consisting of a small stand, usually
supported on three legs, and most commonly made of mahogany or rosewood,
for holding a wash-hand basin. The smaller varieties were used for
rose-water ablutions, or for the operation of hair-powdering. The larger
ones, which possessed sockets for soap-dishes, were the predecessors of the
ample modern wash-hand stand. Both varieties, often of very elegant form,
were in extensive use throughout a large part of the 18th century.
