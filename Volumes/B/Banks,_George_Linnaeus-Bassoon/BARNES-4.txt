BARNES, JOSHUA (1654-1712), English scholar, was born in London on the 10th
of January 1654. Educated at Christ's Hospital and at Emmanuel College,
Cambridge, he was in 1695 chosen regius professor of Greek, a language
which he wrote and spoke with the utmost facility. One of his first
publications was entitled _Gerania; a New Discovery of a Little Sort of
People, anciently discoursed of, called Pygmies_ (1675), a whimsical sketch
to which Swift's _Voyage to Lilliput_ possibly owes something. Among his
other works are a _History of that Most Victorious Monarch Edward III._
(1688), in which he introduces long and elaborate speeches into the
narrative; editions of Euripides (1694) and of Homer (1711), also one of
Anacreon (1705) which contains titles of Greek verses of his own which he
hoped to publish. He died on the 3rd of August 1712, at Hemingford, near St
Ives, Hunts.
