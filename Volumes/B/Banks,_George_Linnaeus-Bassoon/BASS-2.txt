BASS (the same word as "base," and so pronounced, but influenced in
spelling by the Ital. _basso_), deep, low; especially in music, the lower
part in the harmony of a composition, the lowest male voice, or the
lowest-pitched of a class of instruments, as the bass-clarinet.

Bass or bast (a word of doubtful origin, pronounced _b[)a]s_) is the
fibrous bark of the lime tree, used in gardening for tying up plants, or to
make mats, soft plaited baskets, &c. Basswood is the American lime-tree,
Tilia Americana; white basswood is T. heterophylla.

The name bass is also given to a fish closely resembling the perch.
