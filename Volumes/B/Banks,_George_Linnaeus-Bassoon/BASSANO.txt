BASSANO, JACOPO DA PONTE (1510-1592), Venetian painter, was born at
Bassano. He was educated by his father, who was himself an artist, and then
completed his studies at Venice. On the death of his father he returned to
Bassano and settled there. His subjects were generally peasants and
villagers, cattle and landscapes, with some portraits and historical
designs. His figures are well designed, and his animals and landscapes have
an agreeable air of simple nature. His compositions, though they have not
much eloquence or grandeur, have abundance of force and truth; the local
colours are well observed, the flesh-tints are fresh and brilliant, and his
chiaroscuro and perspective are unexceptionable. He is said to have
finished a great number of pictures; but his genuine works are somewhat
rare and valuable--many of those which are called originals being copies
either by the sons of Bassano or by others. Bassano's style varied
considerably during his lifetime. He naturally was at first a copier of his
father, but his productions in this style are not of great value. He was
then strongly attracted by the lightness and beautiful colouring of Titian,
and finally adopted the style which is recognized as his own. Although he
painted few great pictures, and preferred humble subjects, yet his
altar-piece of the Nativity at Bassano is estimated highly by the best
judges, and in Lanzi's opinion is the finest work of its class.
