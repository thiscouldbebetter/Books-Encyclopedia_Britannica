BARISAL, a town of British India, headquarters of Backergunje district in
Eastern Bengal and Assam, situated on a river of the same name. Pop. (1901)
18,978. It is an important centre of river trade, on the steamer route
through the Sundarbans [v.03 p.0402] from Calcutta to the Brahmaputra. It
contains a first grade college and several schools. There are a public
library, established by subscription in 1858; and a students' union, for
helping the sick and poor and promoting the intellectual and physical
improvement of boys. Barisal has given its name to a curious physical
phenomenon, known as the "Barisal guns," the cause of which has not been
satisfactorily explained. These are noises, like the report of cannon,
frequently heard in the channels of the delta of the Brahmaputra, at the
rising of the tide.
