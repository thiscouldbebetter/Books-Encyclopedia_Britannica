BAROCCHIO (or BAROZZI), GIACOMO, called DA VIGNOLA (1507-1573), Italian
architect, was born at Vignola in the Modenese territory on the 1st of
October 1507. His early work was conducted at Bologna, Piacenza, Assisi and
Perugia, until he was summoned to Rome as papal architect under Pope Julius
III. In 1564 he succeeded Michelangelo as the architect of St Peter's, and
executed various portions of that fabric, besides a variety of works in
Rome. The designs for the Escorial were also supplied by him. He is the
author of an excellent work on the _Five Orders of Architecture_ (Rome,
1563), and another work on _Practical Perspective_ (Rome, 1583). To his
extensive acquirements and exquisite taste were superadded an amenity of
manners and a noble generosity that won the affection and admiration of all
who knew him. He died in Rome on the 7th of July 1573. He was an eminent
upholder of the classic style at a period when the style known as _baroque_
was corrupting the architecture of Italy. The term _baroque_ owes its
origin to the Spanish word _barrueco_ or _berrueco_, an imperfectly round
pearl, and is not derived from the architect Barocchio, whose name so much
resembles it. Yet it is curious that it was much used to describe a debased
form of architecture encouraged by the Jesuits whose church in Rome was
built by Barocchio.
