BANNERS, FEAST OF (Jap. _Nobori-no-Sekku_), a Japanese festival in honour
of male children held on the 5th of May. Every householder who has sons
fastens a bamboo pole over his door and hangs from it gaily-coloured paper
fishes, one for each of his boys. These fishes are made to represent carp,
which are in Japanese folklore symbolical of health and longevity. The day
is recognized as a national holiday.

For banners in general see FLAG.
