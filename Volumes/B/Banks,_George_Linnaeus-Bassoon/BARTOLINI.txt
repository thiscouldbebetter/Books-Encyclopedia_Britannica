BARTOLINI, LORENZO (1777-1850), Italian sculptor, was born in Vernio in
Tuscany. After acquiring great skill and reputation as a modeller in
alabaster, he went in 1797 to Paris, where he studied painting under
Desmarets, and afterwards sculpture under F. F. Lemot. The bas-relief
"Cleobis and Biton," with which he gained the second prize of the Academy
in 1803, at once established his fame as a sculptor and gained for him a
number of influential patrons. He executed many minor pieces for Denon,
besides busts of Méhul and Cherubini. His great patron, however, was
Napoleon, for whom he executed a colossal bust, and who sent him to Carrara
to found a school of sculpture. Here he remained till after the fall of
Napoleon, and then took up his residence in Florence, where he resided till
his death. His works are varied and include an immense number of busts. The
best are, perhaps, the group of Charity, the "Hercules and Lichas" and the
"Faith in God," which exemplify the highest types of Bartolini's style.
Popular opinion in Italy associates his qualities as a sculptor with those
of Thorwaldsen and Canova.
