BARLOW, PETER (1776-1862), English writer on pure and applied mathematics,
was born at Norwich in 1776 and died on the 1st of March 1862. In 1806 he
was appointed mathematical master in the Woolwich Academy, and filled that
post for forty-one years. In 1823 he was made a fellow of the Royal
Society, and two years later received the Copley medal. Steam locomotion
received much attention at his hands, and he sat on the railway commissions
of 1836, 1839, 1842, 1845. He received many distinctions from British and
foreign scientific societies. Barlow's principal works are--_Elementary
Investigation of the Theory of Numbers_ (1811); _New Mathematical and
Philosophical Dictionary_ (1814); _Essay on Magnetic Attractions_ (1820).
The investigations on magnetism led to the important practical discovery of
a means of rectifying or compensating compass errors in ships. Besides
compiling numerous useful tables, he contributed largely to the
_Encyclopaedia Metropolitana_.
