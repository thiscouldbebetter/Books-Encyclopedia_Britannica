BARTAN, more correctly BARTIN, a town in the vilayet of Kastamuni, Asiatic
Turkey, retaining the name of the ancient village Parthenia and situated
near the mouth of the Bartan-su (anc. _Parthenius_), which formed part of
the boundary between Bithynia and Paphlagonia. Various aetiological
explanations of the name Parthenius were given by the ancients, _e.g._ that
the maiden Artemis hunted on its banks, or that the flow of its waters was
gentle and maiden-like. The town, which is the residence of a _kaïmakam,_
is built on two low limestone hills and its streets are paved with
limestone blocks. It is noted for the fine boxwood grown in the vicinity,
is a port of call for Black Sea coasting steamers and carries on a
considerable trade with Constantinople which might be increased were it not
for the obstruction of the harbour by a bar. Pop. 8677, according to
Cuinet, _La Turquie d'Asie_ (1894).
