BARASAT, a subdivisional town in the district of the Twenty-four Parganas,
Bengal, India. For a considerable time Barasat town was the headquarters of
a joint magistracy, known as the "Barasat District," but in 1861, on a
readjustment of boundaries Barasat district was abolished by order of
government, and was converted into a subdivision of the Twenty-four
Parganas. Pop. (1901) 8634. It forms a striking illustration of the rural
character of the so-called "towns" in Bengal, and is merely an
agglomeration of 41 separate villages, in which all the operations of
husbandry go on precisely as in the adjacent hamlets.
