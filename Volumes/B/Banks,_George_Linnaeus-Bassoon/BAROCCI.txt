BAROCCI (or BAROCCIO), FEDERIGO (1528-1612), Italian painter, was born at
Urbino, where the genius of Raphael inspired him. In his early youth he
travelled to Rome, where he painted in fresco and was warmly commended by
Michelangelo. He then returned to Urbino, where, with the exception of some
short visits to Rome, he continued to reside till his death. He acquired
great fame by his paintings of religious subjects, in the style of which he
to some extent imitated Correggio. His own followers were very numerous,
but according to Lanzi (_Hist. of Painting_) carried their master's
peculiarities to excess. Barocci also etched from his own designs a few
prints, which are highly finished, and executed with great softness and
delicacy.
