BARNIM I. (_c._ 1209-1278), called the _Good_, was the son of Bogislaus
II., duke of Pomerania-Stettin, and succeeded to this duchy on his father's
death in 1220. After he became of age he was engaged in a long struggle
with external enemies, and in 1250 was compelled to recognize the supremacy
of the margrave of Brandenburg. Having in 1264 united the whole of
Pomerania under his rule, Barnim devoted his energies to improving its
internal condition. He introduced German settlers and customs into the
duchy, founded many towns, and was extremely generous towards
ecclesiastical foundations. He died on the 13th or 14th of November 1278.
