BARBUDA, an island in the British West Indies. It lies 25 m. N. of Antigua,
of which it is a dependency, in 17° 33' N. and 61° 43' W., and it has an
area of 62 sq. m. Pop. (1901) 775. It is flat and densely wooded. On the
western side there is a large lagoon, separated from the sea by a spit of
sand. The part of the island under cultivation is very fertile, and the air
is remarkable for its purity. Cattle and horses are bred and wild deer are
still found. Salt and phosphates of lime are exported. The island was
annexed by Great Britain in 1628 and was bestowed in 1680 upon the
Codrington family who, for more than 200 years, held it as a kind of feudal
fief.
