BART, JEAN (1651-1702), French naval commander, son of a fisherman, was
born in Dunkirk on the 21st of October 1651. He served when young in the
Dutch navy, but when war broke out between Louis XIV. and Holland in 1672
he entered the French service. He gained great distinction in the
Mediterranean, where he held an irregular sort of commission, not being
then able from his low birth to receive a command in the navy. His success
was so great, however, that he was made a lieutenant in 1679. He rose
rapidly to the rank of captain and then to that of admiral. The peace of
Ryswick put a close to his active service. Many anecdotes are narrated of
the courage and bluntness of the uncultivated sailor, who became the
popular hero [v.03 p.0447] of the French naval service. The town of Dunkirk
has honoured his memory by a statue and by naming a public square after
him.
