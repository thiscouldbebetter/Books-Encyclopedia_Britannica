BARDOUX, AGÉNOR (1820-1897), French statesman, was a native of Bourges.
Established as an advocate at Clermont, he did not hesitate to proclaim his
republican sympathies. In 1871 he was elected deputy of the National
Assembly, and re-elected in 1876 and in 1877. In the chamber he was
president of the group of the left centre, standing strongly for the
republic but against anti-clericalism. After the _coup d'état_ of the 16th
of May, he was one of the leaders of the "363." In the republican chamber
elected after the 16th of May, he became minister of public instruction
(December 1877), and proposed various republican laws, notably on
compulsory primary education. He resigned in 1879. He was not re-elected in
1881, but in December 1882 was named senator for life. He wrote essays on
_Les Légistes et leur influence sur la société française_ (1878); _Le Comte
de Montlosier et le Gallicanisme_ (1881); and published in 1882 his _Dix
Années de vie politique_.
