BASHI-BAZOUK, the name given to a species of irregular mounted troops
employed by the Turks. They are armed and maintained by the government but
do not receive pay. They do not wear uniform or distinctive badges. They
fight either mounted or dismounted, chiefly the latter, but are incapable
of undertaking serious work, because of their lack of discipline. Their
uncertain temper has sometimes made it necessary for the Turkish regular
troops to disarm them by force, but they are often useful in the work of
reconnaissance and in outpost duty. They are accused, and generally with
justice, of robbery and maltreatment of the civil population, resembling in
those things, as in their fighting methods and value, the Croats, Pandours
and Tolpatches of 18th-century European armies. The term is also used of a
mounted force, existing in peace time in various provinces of the Turkish
empire, which performs the duties of gendarmerie.
