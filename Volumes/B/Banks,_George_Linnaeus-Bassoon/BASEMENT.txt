BASEMENT, the term applied to the lowest storey of any building placed
wholly or partly below the level of the ground. It is incorrectly applied
to the ground storey of any building, even when, as for instance in the
case of Somerset House, London, the ground floor is of plain or rusticated
masonry, and the upper storey which it supports is divided up and decorated
with columns or pilasters.
