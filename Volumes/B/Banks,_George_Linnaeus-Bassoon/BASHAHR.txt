BASHAHR, or BISAHIR, a Rajput hill state, within the Punjab, amid the
Himalayan mountains, with an area of 3820 sq. m. and a population in 1901
of 80,582. In 1898, the raja being of weak intellect and without heir, the
administration was undertaken by a British official. In 1906 there were
some local troubles owing to the refusal of the people to pay taxes. The
revenue is obtained chiefly from land and forests, the latter being leased
to the British government.
