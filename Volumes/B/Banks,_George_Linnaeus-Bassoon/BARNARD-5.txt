BARNARD, JOHN, English musician, was a minor canon of St Paul's in the
reign of Charles I. He was the first to publish a collection of English
cathedral music. It contains some of the finest 16th-century masterpieces,
ranging from the "_faux-bourdon_" style of Tallis's _Pieces and Responses_
to the most developed types of full anthem. The text, however, is not
trustworthy.
