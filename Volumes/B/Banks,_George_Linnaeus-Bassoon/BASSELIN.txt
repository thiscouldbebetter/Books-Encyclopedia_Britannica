BASSELIN, OLIVIER (_c._ 1400-_c._ 1450), French poet, was born in the
Val-de-Vire in Normandy about the end of the 14th century. He was by
occupation a fuller, and tradition still points out the site of his mill.
His drinking songs became famous under the name of Vaux-de-Vire, corrupted
in modern times into "vaudeville." From various traditions it may be
gathered that Basselin was killed in the English wars about the middle of
the century, possibly at the battle of Formigny (1450). At the beginning of
the 17th century a collection of songs was published by a Norman lawyer,
Jean Le Houx, purporting to be the work of Olivier Basselin. There seems to
be very little doubt that Le Houx was himself the author of the songs
attributed to Basselin, as well as of those he acknowledged as his own.

It has been suggested that Basselin's name may be safely connected with
some songs preserved in the _Bibliothèque Nationale_ at Paris, and
published at Caen in 1866 by M. Armand Gasté. The question is discussed in
M. V. Patard's _La Vérité dans la question Olivier Basselin et Jean le Houx
à propos du Vau-de-Vire_ (1897). A. Gasté's edition (1875) of the
_Vaux-de-Vire_ was translated (1885) by J. P. Muirhead.
