BALLSTON SPA, a village and the county-seat of Saratoga county, New York,
U.S.A., about 7 m. S. of Saratoga Springs. Pop. (1890) 3527; (1900) 3923;
(1910 U.S. Census) 4138. It is served by the Delaware & Hudson railway, and
is connected with Saratoga Springs, Albany, and Schenectady by electric
lines. There are several manufacturing establishments, among which are one
of the largest manufactories of paper-bags in the United States and a large
tannery. It is, however, as a popular summer resort that Ballston Spa is
best known. Many fine chalybeate and other springs rising through solid
rock from a depth of about 650 ft. furnish a highly effervescent water of
considerable medicinal and commercial value. The village has the Ballston
Spa public library, the Saratoga county law library and the Saratoga county
court house. Ballston Spa, which was named in honour of the Rev. Eliphalet
Ball, an early settler, was settled about 1787 by the grandfather of
Stephen A. Douglas, and was incorporated in 1855.
