BAIN, ANDREW GEDDES (1797-1864), British geologist, was a native of
Scotland. In 1820 he emigrated to Cape Colony, and carried on for some
years the business of a saddler at Graaf Reinet. During the Kaffir War in
1833-34 he took command of a provisional battalion raised for the defence
of the frontier. Later he was engaged to construct a military road through
the Ecca Pass, and displayed engineering talents which led to his being
permanently employed as surveyor of military roads under the corps of Royal
Engineers. This occupation created an interest in geology, which was
fostered in 1837 by the loan of Lyell's _Elements_. He discovered the
remains of many reptilia, including the _Dicynodon_, which was obtained
from the Karroo Beds near Fort Beaufort and described by Owen. Devoting all
his spare energies to geological studies, Bain prepared in 1852 the first
comprehensive geological map of South Africa, a work of great merit, which
was published by the Geological Society of London in 1856. He died at Cape
Town in 1864.
