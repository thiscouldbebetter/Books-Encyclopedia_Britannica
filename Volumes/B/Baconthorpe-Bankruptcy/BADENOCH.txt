BADENOCH, a district of south-east Inverness-shire, Scotland, bounded on
the N. by the Monadhliath mountains, on the E. by the Cairngorms and
Braemar, on the S. by Atholl and the Grampians, and on the W. by Lochaber.
Its area is somewhat undefined, but it may be estimated to measure 36 m.
from N.E. to S.W. and 15 m. from N. to S. Excepting the valley of the Spey
and the great glens, it is almost entirely a wild mountainous tract, many
hills exceeding 3000 ft. in height, and contains in the forests of Alder,
Drumochter, Gaick and Feshie some of the best deer country in the
Highlands. Loch Laggan and Loch Ericht are the principal lakes, and the
district is abundantly watered by the Spey and its numerous tributaries. It
is traversed, from Dalnaspidal to Boat of Garten, by the Highland railway.
There are very few industries, and population groups itself at Kingussie
and other places on or near the Spey. From 1229 to 1313 the lordship of
Badenoch was owned by the Comyns. In 1371 Robert II. granted it to his son
Alexander Stewart, 1st earl of Buchan (1343-1405), the "Wolf of Badenoch."
Reverting to the crown, it was bestowed in 1452 upon the 1st earl of
Huntly, and still gives the title of lord of Badenoch to the marquess of
Huntly.
