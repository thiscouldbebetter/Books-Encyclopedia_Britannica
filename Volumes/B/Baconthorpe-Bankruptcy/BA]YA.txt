BA[H.]YA, IBN PAQUDA, a Jewish ethical writer who flourished at Saragossa
in the 11th century. In 1040 he wrote in Arabic a treatise, _Duties of the
Heart_. This book was one of the most significant and influential Jewish
works of the middle ages. Ba[h.]ya portrays an intensely spiritual
conception of religion, and rises at times to great heights of impassioned
mysticism.

[v.03 p.0214] The Law, in the rabbinical sense, was reverenced by Ba[h.]ya,
and he converted it into part and parcel of the Jew's inner life. The book
is divided into ten parts:--the Unity of God; Contemplation; Worship;
Trust; Consecration; Humility; Repentance; Self-Examination; the Ascetic
Life; the Love of God. Some selections from Ba[h.]ya's work have been
rendered into English by E. Collins.
