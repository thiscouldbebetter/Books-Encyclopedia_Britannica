BALMÈS, JAIME LUCIANO (1810-1848), Spanish ecclesiastic, eminent as a
political writer and a philosopher, was born at Vich in Catalonia, on the
28th of August 1810, and died there on the 9th of July 1848. Having
attacked the regent Espartero and been exiled he founded and edited on his
return the _El Pensamiento de la Nacion_, a Catholic and Conservative
weekly; but his fame rests principally on _El Protestantismo comparado con
el Catolicismo en sus relaciones con la Civilisacion Europea_ (3 vols.,
1842-1844, 6th edition, 1879; Eng. trans. London, 1849), an able defence of
Catholicism on the ground that it represents the spirit of obedience or
order, as opposed to Protestantism, the spirit of revolt or anarchy. From
the historical standpoint it is of little value. The best of his
philosophical works, which are clear expositions of the scholastic system
of thought, are the _Filosofia Fondamental_ (4 vols., 1846, Eng. trans. by
H. F. Brownson, 2 vols. New York, 1856), and the _Curso de Filosofia
Elemental_ (4 vols., 1847), which he translated into Latin for use in
seminaries.
