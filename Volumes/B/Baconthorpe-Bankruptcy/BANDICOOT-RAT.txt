BANDICOOT-RAT, the Anglo-Indian name for a large rat (_Nesocia bandicota_),
inhabiting India and Ceylon, which measures from 12 to 15 in. to the root
of the tail, while the tail itself measures from 11 to 13 in. The name is
said to be a corruption of the Telegu _pandi-koku_. It differs from typical
rats of the genus _Mus_ by its broader incisors, and the less distinct
cusps on the molars. Other species of the genus are found from Palestine to
Formosa, as well as in central Asia. The typical species frequents
villages, towns and cultivated grounds all over India and Ceylon, but is
specially common in the south of the peninsula. (See RODENTIA.)
