BANG, HERMANN JOACHIM (1858- ), Danish author, was born of a noble family
in the island of Zealand. When he was twenty he published two volumes of
critical essays on the realistic movement. In 1880 he published his novel
_Haablöse Slaegter_ ("Families without hope"), which at once aroused
attention. After some time spent in travel and a successful lecturing tour
in Norway and Sweden, he settled in Copenhagen, and produced a series of
novels and collections of short stories, which placed him in the front rank
of Scandinavian novelists. Among his more famous stories are _Faedra_
(1883) and _Tine_ (1889). The latter won for its author the friendship of
Ibsen and the enthusiastic admiration of Jonas Lie. Among his other works
are:--_Det hvide Hus_ (The White House, 1898), _Excentriske Noveller_
(1885), _Stille Eksistenzer_ (1886), _Liv og Död_ (Life and Death, 1899),
_Englen Michael_ (1902), a volume of poems (1889) and of recollections (_Ti
Aar,_ 1891).
