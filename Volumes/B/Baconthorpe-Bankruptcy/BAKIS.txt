BAKIS (_i.e._ "speaker," from [Greek: bazô]), a general name for the
inspired prophets and dispensers of oracles who flourished in Greece from
the 8th to the 6th century B.C. Suidas mentions three: a Boeotian, an
Arcadian and an Athenian. The first, who was the most famous, was said to
have been inspired by the nymphs of the Corycian cave. His oracles, of
which specimens are extant in Herodotus and Pausanias, were written in
hexameter verse, and were considered to have been strikingly fulfilled. The
Arcadian was said to have cured the women of Sparta of a fit of madness.
Many of the oracles which were current under his name have been attributed
to Onomacritus.
