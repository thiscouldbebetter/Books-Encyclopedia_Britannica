BAEL FRUIT (_Aegle marmelos_). _Aegle_ is a genus of the botanical natural
order Rutaceae, containing two species in tropical Asia and one in west
tropical Africa. The plants are trees bearing strong spines, with
alternate, compound leaves each with three leaflets and panicles of
sweet-scented white flowers. _Aegle marmelos_, the bael- or bel-fruit tree
(also known as Bengal quince), is found wild or cultivated throughout
India. The tree is valued for its fruit, which is oblong to pyriform in
shape, 2-5 in. in diameter, and has a grey or yellow rind and a sweet,
thick orange-coloured pulp. The unripe fruit is cut up in slices, sun-dried
and used as an astringent; the ripe fruit is described as sweet, aromatic
and cooling. The wood is yellowish-white, and hard but not durable. The
name _Aegle_ is from one of the Hesperides, in reference to the golden
fruit; _marmelos_ is Portuguese for quince.
