BAM, a town of Persia in the province of Kerman, situated 115 m. S.E. of
the city of Kerman at an elevation of 3600 ft. on both banks of the river
Bam. Pop. about 13,000. It is the capital of the Bam-Narmashir district and
has extensive groves of date-palms and gardens. Outside the town stands the
famous citadel with walls 40 ft. in height. This citadel was, even as late
as the beginning of the 19th century, the strongest fortified place in
Persia, and owed its strength to the Afghans who took Bam in 1719 and were
not finally expelled until 1801. Post and telegraph offices have been
established there since 1903.
