BANDANA, or BANDANNA, a word probably derived through the Portuguese from
the Hindustani _b[=a]ndhn[=u]_, which signified a primitive method of
obtaining an effect in dyeing by tying up cloth in different places to
prevent the particular parts from receiving the dye. The name was given to
richly coloured silk handkerchiefs produced by this process, of which
bright colours were characteristic. Bandanas are now commonly made of
cotton and produced in Lancashire, whence they are exported. The effect is
also produced by a regular process in calico printing, in which the pattern
is made by discharging the colour.
