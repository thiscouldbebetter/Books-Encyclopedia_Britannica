BALQUHIDDER (Gaelic, "the farm in the back-lying country"), a village and
parish of Perthshire, Scotland. Pop. of parish (1901) 605. The village lies
2 m. W. of the station of the same name on the Caledonian railway from
Callander to Oban, and 27¾ m. N.W. of Stirling. It is situated at the east
end of Loch Voil, a lake at the foot of the Braes of Balquhidder. The
Maclaurins acquired the district as early as the 9th century and occupied
it for several hundred years until ousted by the Macgregors, a neighbouring
clan, who had repeatedly raided their lands, and in 1558 slew the chief and
many of his followers. Balquhidder was the scene of some of the exploits of
Rob Roy, who died there in 1734. His grave in the old kirkyard is marked by
a stone ornamented with rude carving, executed probably centuries before
his time. Another ancient stone is said traditionally to cover the grave of
Angus, the Columban missionary, who was the first to carry on Christian
work in this part of the Highlands.
