BAINBRIDGE, JOHN (1582-1643), English astronomer, was born at
Ashby-de-la-Zouch, in Leicestershire. He started as a physician and
practised for some years, kept a school and studied astronomy. Having
removed to London, he was admitted (November 6, 1618) a licentiate of the
college of physicians, and attracted notice by a publication concerning the
comet of 1618. Sir Henry Savile (1549-1622) thereupon appointed him in 1619
to the Savilian chair of astronomy just founded by him at Oxford;
Bainbridge was incorporated of Merton College and became, in 1631 and 1635
respectively, junior and senior reader of Linacre's lectures. He died at
Oxford on the 3rd of November 1643. He wrote _An Astronomical Description
of the late Comet_ (1619); _Canicularia_ (1648); and translated Proclus'
_De Sphaera_, and Ptolemy's _De Planetarum Hypothesibus_ (1620). Several
[v.03 p.0223] manuscript works by him exist in the library of Trinity
College, Dublin.
