BAGNACAVALLO, BARTOLOMMEO (1484-1542), Italian painter. His real name was
RAMENGHI, but he received the cognomen Bagnacavallo from the little village
where he was born. He studied first under Francia, and then proceeded to
[v.03 p.0202] Rome, where he became a pupil of Raphael. While studying
under him he worked along with many others at the decoration of the gallery
in the Vatican, though it is not known what portions are his work. On his
return to Bologna he quickly took the leading place as an artist, and to
him were due the great improvements in the general style of what has been
called the Bolognese school. His works were considered to be inferior in
point of design to some other productions of the school of Raphael, but
they were distinguished by rich colouring and graceful delineation. They
were highly esteemed by Guido Reni and the Carracci, who studied them
carefully and in some points imitated them. The best specimens of
Bagnacavallo's works, the "Dispute of St Augustine," and a "Madonna and
Child," are at Bologna.
