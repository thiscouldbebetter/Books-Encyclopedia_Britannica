BANATE (a corruption of Panaiti, their real name), or BANNOCK, as they are
now usually called, a tribe of North American Indians of Shoshonean stock.
They were sometimes known as "Robber Indians." Their former range was
southern Idaho and eastern Oregon. They are now divided between the Fort
Hall and Lemhi reservations, Idaho. They were generally friendly with the
whites, but in 1866 and in 1877-78 there were serious outbreaks. They
number about 500.
