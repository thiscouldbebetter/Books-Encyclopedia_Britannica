BAKHCHI-SARAI (Turk. for "garden-palace"), a town of Russia, in the
government of Taurida, situated in a narrow gorge in the Crimea, 20 m. by
rail S.S.W. of Simferopol. From the close of the 15th century down to 1783
it was the residence of the Tatar khans of the Crimea; and its streets wear
a decidedly oriental look. The principal building, the palace, or
_Khan-sarai_, was originally erected in 1519 by Abdul-Sahal-Ghirai,
destroyed in 1736, and restored at Potemkin's command for the reception of
Catherine II. Attached to it is a mausoleum, which contains the tombs of
many of the khans. There are in the place no fewer then thirty-six mosques.
The population consists for the most part of Tatars. Bakhchi-sarai
manufactures morocco, sheepskin cloaks, agricultural implements, sabres and
cutlery. Pop. (1897) 12,955. Two and a half miles to the east is
Chufut-Kaleh (or Jews' city), formerly the chief seat of the Karaite Jews
of the Crimea, situated on lofty and almost inaccessible cliffs; it is now
deserted except by the rabbi. Between Bakhchi-sarai and Chufut-kaleh is the
Uspenskiy monastery, clinging like a swallow's nest to the face of the
cliffs, and the scene of a great pilgrimage on the 15th (29th) of August
every year.
