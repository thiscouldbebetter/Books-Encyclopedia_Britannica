BADBY, JOHN (d. 1410), one of the early Lollard martyrs, was a tailor (or
perhaps a blacksmith) in the west Midlands, and was condemned by the
Worcester diocesan court for his denial of transubstantiation. Badby
bluntly maintained that when Christ sat at supper with his disciples he had
not his body in his hand to distribute, and that "if every host consecrated
at the altar were the Lord's body, then there be 20,000 Gods in England." A
further court in St Paul's, London, presided over by Archbishop Arundel,
condemned him to be burned at Smithfield, the tournament ground just
outside the city walls. It is said that the prince of Wales (afterwards
Henry V.) witnessed the execution and offered the sufferer both life and a
pension if he would recant; but in Walsingham's words, "the abandoned
villain declined the prince's advice, and chose rather to be burned than to
give reverence to the life-giving sacrament. So it befell that this
mischievous fellow was burnt to ashes, and died miserably in his sin."
