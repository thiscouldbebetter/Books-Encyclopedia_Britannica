BADMINTON, or GREAT BADMINTON, a village in the southern parliamentary
division of Gloucestershire, England, 100 m. W. of London by the Great
Western railway (direct line to south Wales). Here is Badminton House, the
seat of the dukes of Beaufort, standing in a park some 10 m. in
circumference. The manor of Badminton was acquired in 1608 from Nicolas
Boteler (to whose family it had belonged for several centuries) by Thomas,
Viscount Somerset (d. 1650 or 1651), third son of Edward, 4th earl of
Worcester, and was given by his daughter and heiress Elizabeth to Henry
Somerset, 3rd marquess of Worcester and 1st duke of Beaufort (1629-1699),
who built the present mansion (1682) on the site of the old manor house. It
is a stone building in Palladian style, and contains a number of splendid
paintings and much fine wood-carving. The parish church of St. Michael
stands close to it. This is a Grecian building (1785), with a richly
ornamented ceiling and inlaid altar-pavement; it also contains much fine
sculpture in the memorials to former dukes, and is the burial-place of
Field Marshal Lord Raglan, who was the youngest son of the 5th duke of
Beaufort. Raglan Castle, near Monmouth, now a beautiful ruin, was the seat
of the earls and the 1st marquess of Worcester, until it was besieged by
the Parliamentarians in 1646, and after its capitulation was dismantled.
