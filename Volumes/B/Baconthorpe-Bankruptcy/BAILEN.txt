BAILÉN, or BAYLÉN, a town of southern Spain, in the province of Jaén; 21 m.
by road N. of the city of Jaén. Pop. (1900) 7420. Bailén is probably the
ancient Baecula, where the Romans, under P. Cornelius Scipio the elder,
signally defeated the Carthaginians in 209 and 206 B.C. In its
neighbourhood, also, in 1212, was fought the great battle of Las Navas de
Tolosa, in which, according to the ancient chroniclers, the Castilians
under Alphonso VIII, slew 200,000 Moors, and themselves only lost 25 men.
Although this estimate is absurd, the victory of the Christians was
complete. The capitulation of Bailén, signed at Andújar by the French
general Dupont, on the 23rd of July 1808 after several days' hard fighting,
involved the surrender of 17,000 men to the Spaniards, and was the first
severe blow suffered by the French in the Peninsular War.
