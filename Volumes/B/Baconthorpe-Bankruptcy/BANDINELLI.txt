BANDINELLI, BARTOLOMMEO or BACCIO (1493-1560), Florentine sculptor, was the
son of an eminent goldsmith, and from him Bandinelli obtained the first
elements of drawing. Showing a strong inclination for the fine arts, he was
early placed under Rustici, a sculptor, and a friend of Leonardo da Vinci,
with whom he made rapid progress. The ruling motive in his life seems to
have been jealousy both of Benvenuto Cellini and of Michelangelo, one of
whose cartoons he is said to have torn up and destroyed. He is regarded by
some as inferior in sculpture only to Michelangelo, with whom a comparison
unfavourable to Bandinelli is tempted in such works as the marble colossal
group of Hercules and Cacus in the Piazza del Gran Duco, and the group of
Adam and Eve in the Bargello. Among his best works must be reckoned the
_bassi-rilievi_ in the choir of the cathedral of Florence; his copy of the
Laocoon; and the figures of Christ and Nicodemus on his own tomb.
