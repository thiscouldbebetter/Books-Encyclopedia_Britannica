BAKRI [Ab[=u] `Ubaid `Abdallah ibn `Abd ul-`Az[=i]z ul-Bakr[=i]],
(1040-1094), Arabian geographer, was born at Cordova. His best-known work
is the dictionary of geographical names which occur in the poets, with an
introduction on the seats of the Arabian tribes. This has been edited by F.
Wüstenfeld (Göttingen, 1876-1877). Another of his works was a general
geography of the world, which exists in manuscript. The part referring to
North Africa was edited by McG. de Slane (Algiers, 1857).
