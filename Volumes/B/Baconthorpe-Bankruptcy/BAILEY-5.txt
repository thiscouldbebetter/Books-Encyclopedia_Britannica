BAILEY (said to be a corruption of _Ballium_ by some, and derived by others
from the Fr. _baille_, a corruption of _bataille_, because there the
soldiers were drilled in battle array), the open space between the inner
and outer lines of a fortification. Sometimes there were more than one, as
the Inner and Outer Bailey; there are in England the Old Bailey at London
and at York, and the Upper and Nether Baileys at Colchester.
