BALMORAL CASTLE (Gaelic, "the majestic dwelling"), a private residence of
the British sovereign, in the parish of Crathie and Braemar, Aberdeenshire,
Scotland, on the right bank of the Dee (here spanned by a fine suspension
bridge), 9 m. W. of Ballater and at a height of 900 ft. above the sea. The
property formerly belonged to the Farquharsons of Inverey, from whom it was
acquired by Sir Robert Gordon, whose trustees disposed of the lease in 1848
to the prince consort, by whom the whole estate was purchased in 1852 and
bequeathed to Queen Victoria. The castle is built of granite in the Scots
baronial style, with an eastern tower 100 ft. high commanding a superb
view--Ballochbuie and Braemar to the W., Glen Gairn to the N., Lochnagar
and the beautiful valley of the Dee to the S. On Craig Gowan (1319 ft.), a
hill 1 m. to the south, have been erected memorial cairns to Queen
Victoria, the prince consort, Princess Alice and other members of the royal
family of Great Britain. The parish church of Crathie (1903), replacing the
kirk of 1806, is 1½ m. to the W., and about 2 m. farther west stands
Abergeldie Castle, another Highland royal residence, an ancient building to
which modern additions have been made, inhabited by King Edward VII. when
prince of Wales, and after his accession to the throne used as a
shooting-lodge.
