BALDERIC, the name given to the author of a chronicle of the bishops of
Cambrai, written in the 11th century. This _Gesta episcoporum
Cambracensium_ was for some time attributed to Balderic, archbishop of
Noyon, but it now seems tolerably certain that the author was an anonymous
canon of Cambrai. The work is of considerable importance for the history of
the north of France during the 11th century, and was first published in
1615. [v.03 p.0243] The best edition is in the _Monumenta Germaniae
historica. Scriptores_, Bd. vii. (Hanover and Berlin, 1826-1892), which
contains an introduction by L. C. Bethmann.

See _Histoire littéraire de la France_, tome viii. (Paris, 1865-1869).
