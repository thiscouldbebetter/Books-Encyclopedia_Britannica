BALUE, JEAN (_c._ 1421-1491), French cardinal and minister of Louis XI.,
was born of very humble parentage at Angle in Poitou, and was first
patronized by the bishop of Poitiers. In 1461 he became vicar-general of
the bishop of Angers. His activity, cunning and mastery of intrigue gained
him the appreciation of Louis XI., who made him his almoner. In a short
time Balue became a considerable personage. In 1465 he received the
bishopric of Évreux; the king made him _le premier du grant conseil_, and,
in spite of his dissolute life, obtained for him a cardinalate (1468). But
in that year Balue was compromised in the king's humiliation by Charles the
Bold at Péronne and excluded from the council. He then intrigued with
Charles against his master: their secret correspondence was intercepted,
and on the 23rd of April 1469 Balue was thrown into prison, where he
remained eleven years, but not, as has been alleged, in an iron cage. In
1480, through the intervention of Pope Sixtus IV., he was set at liberty,
and from that time lived in high favour at the court of Rome. He received
the bishopric of Albano and afterwards that of Palestrina. In 1484 he was
even sent to France as legate _a latere_. He died at Ancona in 1491.
