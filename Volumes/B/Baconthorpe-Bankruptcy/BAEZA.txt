BAÉZA (anc. _Beatia_), a town of southern Spain, in the province of Jaén;
in the Loma de Ubeda, a mountain range between the river Guadalquiver on
the S. and its tributary the Guadalimar on the N. Pop. (1900) 14,379. Baéza
has a station 3 m. S.W. on the Lináres-Almería railway. Its chief buildings
are those of the university (founded in 1533, and replaced by a theological
seminary), the cathedral and the Franciscan monastery. The Cordova and
Ubeda gates, and the arch of Baéza, are among the remains of its old
fortifications, which were of great strength. The town has little trade
except in farm-produce; but its red dye, made from the native cochineal,
was formerly celebrated. In the middle ages Baéza was a flourishing Moorish
city, said to contain 50,000 inhabitants; but it was sacked in 1239 by
Ferdinand III. of Castile, who in 1248 transferred its bishopric to Jaén.
It was the birthplace of the sculptor and painter, Caspar Becarra.
