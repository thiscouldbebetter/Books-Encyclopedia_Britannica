BALTZAR, THOMAS (_c._ 1630-1663), German violinist, was born at Lübeck. He
visited England in 1656 and made a great impression on Evelyn and Anthony
Wood. In 1661 he was appointed leader of the king's famous band of
twenty-four violins, but his intemperate habits cut short his career within
two years. Nothing like his violin-playing had ever been heard in England
before, and in all probability the instrumental music of Henry Purcell owes
much to its influence.
