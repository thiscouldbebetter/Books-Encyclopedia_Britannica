BAIZE (16th century Fr. _baies_, cf. English "bay"), a material probably
named from its original colour, though a derivation is also suggested from
the Fr. _baie_, as the cloth is said to have been originally dyed with
Avignon berries. It is generally a coarse, woollen cloth with a long nap
and is commonly dyed green or red. It is now also made of cotton. The
manufacture is said to have been introduced into England in the 16th
century by refugees from France and the Netherlands. It is used chiefly for
curtains, linings, &c., and sometimes, in the lighter makes, for clothing.
_Table baize_ is a kind of oilcloth used as a cheap and easily-cleaned
covering for tables.
