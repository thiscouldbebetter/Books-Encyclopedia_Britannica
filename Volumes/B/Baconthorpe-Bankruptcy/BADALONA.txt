BADALONA (anc. _Baetulo_), a town of north-eastern Spain, in the province
of Barcelona; 6 m. N.E. of the city of Barcelona, on the left bank of the
small river Besós, and on the Mediterranean Sea. Pop. (1900) 19,240.
Badalona has a station on the coast railway from Barcelona to Perpignan in
France, and a small harbour, chiefly important for its fishing and
boat-building trades. There are gas, chemical and mineral-oil works in the
town, which also manufactures woollen and cotton goods, glass, biscuits,
sugar and brandy; while the surrounding fertile plains produce an abundance
of grain, wine and fruit. Badalona thus largely contributes to the export
trade of Barcelona, and may, in fact, be regarded as its industrial suburb.
