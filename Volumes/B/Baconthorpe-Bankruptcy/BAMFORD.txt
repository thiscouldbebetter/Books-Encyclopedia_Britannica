BAMFORD, SAMUEL (1788-1872), English labour politician, was born at Miston,
near Middleton, Lancashire, on the 28th of February 1788. Himself a
stalwart weaver, he was opposed to physical force movements and did all he
could to restrain the violent resistance to trade oppression which was so
common; yet through attending and speaking at the meeting (1819) at
Peterloo, Manchester (_q.v._), which was intended to be a peaceful
gathering to petition for Parliamentary reform and a repeal of the Corn Law
but ended in a massacre, he was arrested for a breach of the law, convicted
and sentenced to twelve months' imprisonment. He was the author of several
widely popular poems (principally in the Lancashire dialect) showing
sympathy with the conditions of his class, and his _Passages in the Life of
a Radical_ (1840-1844) is an authoritative history of the condition of the
working classes in the years succeeding the battle of Waterloo. He died at
Harpurhey on the 13th of April 1872, and was accorded a public funeral,
attended by thousands.
