BALDINUCCI, FILIPPO (1624-1696), Italian writer on the history of the arts,
was born at Florence. His chief work is entitled _Notizie de' Professori
del Disegno da Cimabue ... (dal 1260 sino al 1670)_, and was first
published in six vols. 4to, 1681-1728. The capital defect of this work is
the attempt to derive all Italian art from the schools of Florence. A good
edition is that by Ranalli (5 vols. 8vo, Florence, 1845-1847). Baldinucci's
whole works were published in fourteen vols. at Milan, 1808-1812.
