BALUSTRADE, a parapet or low screen consisting of a coping or rail
supported on balusters (_q.v._). Sometimes it is employed purely as a
decorative feature beneath the sill of a window which was not carried down
to the ground. Sometimes flowing foliage takes the place of the parapet,
and sometimes so-called balustrades are formed of vertical slabs of stone,
pierced as in the Ca' d'oro at Venice and the balconies of the minarets at
Cairo.
