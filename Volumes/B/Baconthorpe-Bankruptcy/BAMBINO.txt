BAMBINO, IL (Ital. for "the Babe"), the name given in art to the image of
the infant Jesus in swaddling clothes common in Roman Catholic churches.
The most famous is the miracle-working _Santissimo Bambino_ in the church
of Ara Coeli at Rome, the festival of which is celebrated on the feast of
the Epiphany (January 6).
