BAINI, GIUSEPPE (1775-1844), Italian priest, musical critic and composer of
church music, was born at Rome on the 21st of October 1775. He was
instructed in composition by his uncle, Lorenzo Baini, and afterwards by G.
Jannaconi. In 1814 he was appointed musical director to the choir of the
pontifical chapel, to which he had as early as 1802 gained admission in
virtue of his fine bass voice. His compositions, of which very few have
been published, were very favourable specimens of the severe ecclesiastical
style; one in particular, a ten-part _Miserere_, composed for Holy Week in
1821 by order of Pope Pius VII., has taken a permanent place in the
services of the Sistine chapel during Passion Week. Baini held a higher
place, however, as a musical critic and historian than as a composer, and
his _Life of Palestrina_ (_Memorie storico-critiche della vita e delle
opere di Giovanni Pierluigi da Palestrina_, 1828) ranks as one of the best
works of its class. The phrase _Il Principe della Musica_, which has become
finally associated with the name of Palestrina, originates with this
biography. Giuseppe Baini died on the 21st of May 1844 in Rome.
