BALLYMENA, a town of Co. Antrim, Ireland, in the mid parliamentary
division, on the Braid, an affluent of the Maine, 2 m. above their
junction. Pop. of urban district (1901) 10,886. It is 33 m. N.N.W. of
Belfast on the Northern Counties (Midland) railway. Branch lines run to
Larne and to Parkmore on the east coast. The town owes its prosperity
chiefly to its linen trade, introduced in 1733, which gives employment to
the greater part of the inhabitants. Brown linen is a specialty. Iron ore
is raised in the neighbourhood. Antiquities in the neighbourhood are few
and the present buildings of Ballymena Castle and Galgorm Castle are
modern. Gracehill, however, a Moravian settlement, was founded in 1746.
