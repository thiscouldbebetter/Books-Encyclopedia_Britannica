BAJZA, JOSEPH (1804-1858), Hungarian poet and critic, was born at Szücsi in
1804. His earliest contributions were made to Kisfaludy's _Aurora_, a
literary paper of which he was editor from 1830 to 1837. He also wrote
largely in the _Kritische Blätter_, the _Athenaeum_, and the _Figyelmezö_
or _Observer_. His criticisms on dramatic art were considered the best of
these miscellaneous writings. In 1830 he published translations of some
foreign dramas, _Ausländische Bühna_, and in 1835 a collection of his own
poems. In 1837 he was made director of the newly established national
theatre at Pest. He then, for some years, devoted himself to historical
writing, and published in succession the _Historical Library_ (_Törtereti
Könyvtár_), 6 vols., 1843-1845; the _Modern Plutarch_ (_Uj Plutarch_),
1845-1847; and the _Universal History_ (_Világtörétet_), 1847. These works
are to some extent translations from German authors. In 1847 Bajza edited
the journal of the opposition, _Ellenör_, at Leipzig, and in March 1848
Kossuth made him editor of his paper, _Kossuth Hirlapja_. In 1850 he was
attacked with brain disease and died in 1858.
