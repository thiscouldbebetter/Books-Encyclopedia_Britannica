BAHADUR SHAH I., a Mogul emperor of Hindustan, A.D. 1707-1712, the son and
successor of Aurangzeb. At the time of the latter's death his eldest
surviving son, Prince Muazim, was governor of Kabul, and in his absence the
next brother, Azam Shah, assumed the functions of royalty. Muazim came down
from Kabul, and with characteristic magnanimity offered to share the empire
with his brother. Azam would not accept the proposal and was defeated and
slain on the plains of Agra. Muazim then ascended the throne under the
title of Bahadur Shah. He was a man of 64 and died five years later. During
his lifetime the empire was already falling to pieces before the inroads of
the Sikhs and Mahrattas, and through internal dissensions.
