BACSANYI, JANOS (1763-1845), Hungarian poet, was born at Tapolcza on the
11th of May 1763. In 1785 he published his first work, a patriotic poem,
_The Valour of the Magyars_. In the same year he obtained a situation as
clerk in the treasury at Kaschau, and there, in conjunction with other two
Hungarian patriots, edited the _Magyar Museum_, which was suppressed by the
government in 1792. In the following year he was deprived of his clerkship;
and in 1794, having taken part in the conspiracy of Bishop Martinovich, he
was thrown into the state prison of the Spielberg, near Brünn, where he
remained for two years. After his release he took a considerable share in
the _Magyar Minerva_, a literary review, and then proceeded to Vienna,
where he obtained a post in the bank, and married. In 1809 he translated
Napoleon's proclamation to the Magyars, and, in consequence of this
anti-Austrian act, had to take refuge in Paris. After the fall of Napoleon
he was given up to the Austrians, who allowed him to reside at Linz, on
condition of never leaving that town. He published a collection of poems at
Pest, 1827 (2nd ed. Buda, 1835), and also edited the poetical works of
Anyos and Faludi. He died at Linz on the 12th of May 1845.
