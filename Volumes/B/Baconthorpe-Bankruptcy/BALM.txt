BALM, a fragrant herb, _Melissa officinalis_, of the Deadnettle order
(_Labiatae_) with opposite, ovate, crenulated leaves, which are wrinkled
above, and small white or rose-spotted flowers. It is a native of central
and southern Europe; it is often grown in gardens and has become
naturalized in the south of England and grows apparently wild as a garden
escape in North America. The name is from the Greek [Greek: melissa], the
plant being visited by bees. Bastard Balm is an allied plant, _Melittis
Melissophyllum_, a southern European species, found in the south and
south-west of England.
