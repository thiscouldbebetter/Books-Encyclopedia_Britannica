BADLESMERE, BARTHOLOMEW, BARON (1275-1322), English nobleman, was the son
and heir of Gunselm de Badlesmere (d. 1301), and fought in the English army
both in France and Scotland during the later years of the reign of Edward
I. In 1307 he became governor of Bristol Castle, and afterwards Edward II.
appointed him steward of his household; but these marks of favour did not
prevent him from making a compact with some other noblemen to gain supreme
influence in the royal council. Although very hostile to Earl Thomas of
Lancaster, Badlesmere helped to make peace between the king and the earl in
1318, and was a member of the middle party which detested alike Edward's
minions, like the Despensers, and his violent enemies like Lancaster. The
king's conduct, however, drew him to the side of the earl, and he had
already joined Edward's enemies when, in October 1321, his wife, Margaret
de Clare, refused to admit Queen Isabella to her husband's castle at Leeds
in Kent. The king captured the castle, seized and imprisoned Lady
Badlesmere, and civil war began. After the defeat of Lancaster at
Boroughbridge, Badlesmere was taken and hanged at Canterbury on the 14th of
April 1322. His son and heir, Giles, died without children in 1338.
