BALLOON, a globular bag of varnished silk or other material impermeable to
air, which, when inflated with gas lighter than common air, can be used in
aeronautics, or, according to its size, &c., for any purpose for which its
ability to rise and float in the atmosphere adapts such a mechanism.
"Balloon" in this sense was first used in 1783 in connexion with the
invention of the brothers Montgolfier, but the word was in earlier use
(derived from Ital. _ballone_, a large ball) as meaning an actual ball or
ball-game, a primitive explosive bomb or firework, a form of chemical
retort or receiver, and an ornamental globe in architecture; and from the
appearance and shape of an air balloon the word is also given by analogy to
other things, such as a "balloon skirt" in dress, "balloon training" in
horticulture. (See AERONAUTICS, and FLIGHT AND FLYING).
