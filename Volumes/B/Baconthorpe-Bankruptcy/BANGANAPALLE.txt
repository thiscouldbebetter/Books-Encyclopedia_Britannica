BANGANAPALLE, a state of southern India, surrounded by the Madras district
of Kurnool. Area, 255 sq. m.; pop. (1901) 32,264, showing a decrease of 9%
in the decade; estimated revenue £6400, of which a large portion is
alienated in grants to junior branches of the family; no tribute. The
excessive expenditure of the nawab, Syed Fateh Ali Khan, and the general
inefficiency of the administration caused much anxiety to the government,
and in February 1905 he was temporarily removed from the administration of
the state. The town of Banganapalle is not far from the branch of the
Southern Mahratta railway from Guntakal to Bezwada.

[v.03 p.0315] BANGASH, a small tribe of Pathans in the Kohat district of
the North-West Frontier Province of India. They occupy the hills between
Thal and Kohat, and number 3000 fighting men. Formerly they owned the whole
of Kurram, but owing to the encroachments of the Turis, they moved
eastwards, dispossessed the Orakzais, drove them north and took their
territory in the Kohat district, which they now occupy to the west of the
Khattak country. The Khattaks and Bangashes are of exceptionally good
physique and make excellent soldiers.
