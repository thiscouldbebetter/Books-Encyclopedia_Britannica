BANDELIER, ADOLPH FRANCIS ALPHONSE (1840- ), American archaeologist, was
born in Bern, Switzerland, on the 6th of August 1840. When a youth he
emigrated to the United States. After 1880 he devoted himself to
archaeological and ethnological work among the Indians of the south-western
United States, Mexico and South America. Beginning his studies in Sonora
(Mexico), Arizona and New Mexico, he made himself the leading authority on
the history of this region, and--with F. H. Cushing and his successors--one
of the leading authorities on its prehistoric civilization. In 1892 he
abandoned this field for Ecuador, Bolivia and Peru, where he continued
ethnological, archaeological and historical investigations. In the first
field he was in a part of his work connected with the Hemenway
Archaeological Expedition and in the second worked for Henry Villard of New
York, and for the American Museum of Natural History of the same city.
Bandelier has shown the falsity of various historical myths, notably in his
conclusions respecting the Inca civilization of Peru. His publications
include: three studies "On the Art of War and Mode of Warfare of the
Ancient Mexicans," "On the Distribution and Tenure of Lands and the Customs
with respect to Inheritance among the Ancient Mexicans," and "On the Social
Organization and Mode of Government of the Ancient Mexicans" (Harvard
University, Peabody Museum of American Archaeology and Ethnology, _Annual
Reports_, 1877, 1878, 1879); _Historical Introduction to Studies among the
Sedentary Indians of New Mexico, and Report on the Ruins of the Pueblo of
Pecos_ (1881); _Report of an Archaeological Tour in Mexico in 1881_ (1884);
_Final Report of Investigations among the Indians of the South-western
United States_ (1890-1892, 2 vols.); _Contributions to the History of the
South-western Portion of the United States carried on mainly in the years
from 1880 to 1885_ (1890),--all these in the _Papers_ of the Archaeological
Institute of America, American Series, constituting vols. i.-v.; "The
Romantic School of American Archaeologists" (New York Historical Society,
1885); _The Gilded Man (El Dorado) and other Pictures of the Spanish
Occupancy of America_ (1893); and a report _On the Relative Antiquity of
Ancient Peruvian Burials_ (American Museum of Natural History, Bulletin, v.
30, 1904). He also edited _The Journey of Alvar Nuñez Cabeza de Vaca ...
from Florida to the Pacific_, 1528-1536 (1905), translated into English by
his wife.
