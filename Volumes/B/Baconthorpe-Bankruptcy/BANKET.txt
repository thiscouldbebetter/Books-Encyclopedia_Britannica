BANKET, a South African mining term, applied to the beds of auriferous
conglomerate, chiefly occurring in the Witwatersrand gold-fields (see
GOLD). The name was given to these beds from their resemblance to a
sweetmeat, known in Dutch as "banket," resembling almond hard-bake. The
word is the same as "banquet," and is derived ultimately from "bank" or
"bench," meaning table-feast, hence applied to any delicacy or to various
kinds of confectionery, a use now obsolete in English.
