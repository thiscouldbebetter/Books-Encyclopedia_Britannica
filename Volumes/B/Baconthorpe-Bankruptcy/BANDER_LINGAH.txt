BANDER LINGAH, or LINGA, a town of Persia on the northern shore of the
Persian Gulf and about 300 m. by sea from Bushire, in 26° 33' N., 54° 54'
E. Pop. about 10,000. It forms part of the administrative divisions of the
"Persian Gulf ports," whose governor resides at Bushire. The annual value
of the exports and imports from and into Bander Lingah from 1890 to 1905
averaged about £800,000, but nearly half of that amount is represented by
pearls which pass in transit from the fisheries on the Arab coast to
Bombay. Like many other Persian Gulf ports, Bander Lingah was for many
generations a hereditary patrimony of the Sheikh of an Arab tribe, in this
case the Juvasmi tribe, and it was only in 1898 that the Arabs were
expelled from the place by a Persian force. It is the chief port for the
Persian province of Láristan (under Fars), and has a thriving trade with
Bahrein and the Arab coast. It has a British post office, and the steamers
of the British India Company call there weekly. Of the 133,000 tons of
shipping which in 1905 entered the port 104,500 were British.
