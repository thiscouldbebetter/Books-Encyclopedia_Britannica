BAILEY, NATHAN or NATHANIEL (d. 1742), English philologist and
lexicographer. He compiled a _Dictionarium Britannicum: a more compleat
universal etymological English dictionary than any extant_, bearing the
date 1730, but supposed to have been published in 1721. This was a great
improvement on all previous attempts, and formed the basis of Dr Johnson's
great work. Bailey, who was a Seventh-day Baptist (admitted 1691), had a
school at Stepney, near London, and was the author of _Dictionarium
Domesticum_ and several other educational works. He died on the 27th of
June 1742.
