BAGAMOYO, a seaport of German East Africa in 6° 22' S., 38° 55' E. Pop.
about 18,000, including a considerable number of British Indians. Being the
port on the mainland nearest the town of Zanzibar, 26 m. distant, Bagamoyo
became the starting-point for caravans to the great lakes, and an entrepôt
of trade with the interior of the continent. It possesses no natural
harbour. The beach slopes gently down and ships anchor about 2 m. off the
coast. The town is oriental in character. The buildings include the
residence of the administrator, barracks, a government school for natives,
a mosque and Hindu temple, and the establishment of the _Mission du Sacré
Coeur_, which possesses a large plantation of coco-nut palms. Bagamoyo is
in telegraphic communication with Zanzibar and with the other coast towns
of German East Africa, and has regular steamship communication with
Zanzibar. Of the explorers who made Bagamoyo the starting-point for their
journeys to the interior of Africa, the most illustrious were Sir Richard
Burton, J. H. Speke, J. A. Grant and Sir H. M. Stanley.
