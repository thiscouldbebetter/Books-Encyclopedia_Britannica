BAMP[=U]R, a town of Persia, in the province of Baluchistan, 330 m. S.E. of
Kerman, in 27° 12' N., 60° 24' E., at an elevation of 1720 ft. Pop. about
2000. It is the capital of the province and situated on the banks of the
Bamp[=u]r river which flows from east to west and empties itself about 70
m. W. into a _hamun_, or depression, 50 m. in length, and called
Jaz-morian. The old citadel of Bamp[=u]r which crowned an elevation about
100 ft. in height, 3 m. north of the river, having completely fallen in
ruins, a new fort called Kalah N[=a]sseri, was built at Fahraj, 15 m.
further east, in the eighties; and Fahraj, which now has a population of
about 2500, has become more important than Bamp[=u]r. Fahraj, which is also
known as Pahura, Paharu, Puhra, is by some identified as the Poura where
Alexander the Great halted on his march from India, but others are more in
favour of another Fahraj near Bam, or even of Bamp[=u]r itself.
