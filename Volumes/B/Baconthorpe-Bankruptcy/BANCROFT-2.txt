BANCROFT, HUBERT HOWE (1832- ), American historical writer, was born at
Granville, Ohio, on the 5th of May 1832. From 1852 to 1868 he was a
bookseller in San Francisco. During this period he accumulated a great
library of historical material, and at last gave up business in order to
devote himself to the publication of his _Native Races of the Pacific
States_ (5 vols. 1874-1876), _History of the Pacific States of North
America_ (21 vols. 1882-1890), and other works. For the collection of data
he necessarily relied upon the labours of a corps of assistants, and the
publications named represent, properly speaking, an encyclopaedia rather
than a unified history; but as a storehouse of material their value is
great and is likely to be enduring. In 1905 Bancroft's vast collection was
acquired by the university of California. An account of his methods of work
is given in his _Literary Industries_ (1890).
