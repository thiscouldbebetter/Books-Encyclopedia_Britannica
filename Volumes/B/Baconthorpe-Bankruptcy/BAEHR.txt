BAEHR, JOHANN CHRISTIAN FELIX (1798-1872), German philologist, was born at
Darmstadt on the 13th of June 1798. He studied at the university of
Heidelberg where he was appointed professor of classical philology in 1823,
chief librarian in 1832, and on the retirement of G. F. Creuzer became
director of the philological seminary. He died at Heidelberg on the 29th of
November 1872. His earliest works were editions of Plutarch's _Alcibiades_
(1822), _Philopoemen, Flamininus, Pyrrhus_ (1826), the fragments of Ctesias
(1824), and Herodotus (1830-1835, 1855-1862). But most important of all
were his works on Roman literature and humanistic studies in the middle
ages: _Geschichte der römischen Litteratur_ (4th ed., 1868-1870), and the
supplementary volumes, _Die christlichen Dichter und Geschichtschreiber
Roms_ (2nd ed., 1872), _Die christlich-römische Theologie_ (1837),
_Geschichte der römischen Litteratur im karolingischen Zeitalter_ (1840).
