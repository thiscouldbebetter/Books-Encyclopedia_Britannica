BAGELKHAND, or BAGHELKHAND, a tract of country in central India, occupied
by a collection of native states. The Bagelkhand agency is under the
political superintendence of the governor-general's agent for central
India, and under the direct jurisdiction of a political agent who is also
superintendent [v.03 p.0200] of the Rewa state, residing ordinarily at
Sutna or Rewa. The agency consists of Rewa state and eleven minor states
and estates, of which the more important are Maihar, Nagode and Sohawal.
The total area is 14,323 sq. m., and the population in 1901 was 1,555,024,
showing a decrease of 11% in the decade, due to the results of famine. The
rainfall was very deficient in 1895-1897, causing famine in 1897; and in
1899-1900 there was drought in some sections. The agency was established in
March 1871. Until that date Bagelkhand was under the Bundelkhand agency,
with which it is geographically and historically connected; a general
description of the country will be found under that heading. According to
Wilson, in his _Glossary of Indian Terms_, the Baghelas, who give their
name to this tract of country, are a branch of the Sisodhyia Rajputs who
migrated eastward and once ruled in Gujarat.
