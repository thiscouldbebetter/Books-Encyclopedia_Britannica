BALMACEDA, JOSÉ MANUEL (1838-1891), president of the republic of Chile, was
born in Santiago in 1838. His parents were wealthy, and in his early days
he was chiefly concerned in industrial and agricultural enterprise. In 1865
he was one of the representatives of the Chilean government at the general
South American congress at Lima, and after his return obtained great
distinction as an orator in the national assembly. After discharging some
diplomatic missions abroad, he became successively minister of foreign
affairs and of the interior under the presidency of Señor Santa Maria, and
in the latter capacity carried compulsory civil marriage and several other
laws highly obnoxious to the clergy. In 1886 he was elected president; but,
in spite of his great capacity, his imperious temper little fitted him for
the post. He was soon irreconcilably at variance with the majority of the
national representatives, and on the 1st of January 1891 he sought to
terminate an intolerable situation by refusing to convoke the assembly and
ordering the continued collection of the taxes on his own authority. This
led to the Chilean Civil War of 1891, which ended in the overthrow of
Balmaceda, who committed suicide on the 18th of September, the anniversary
of his elevation to the presidency.
