BANDOLIER, or BANDOLEER (from Fr. _bandoulière_, Ital. _bandoliera_, a
little band), a belt worn over the shoulder, particularly by soldiers to
carry cartridges. In the 17th century wooden cases were hung to the belt to
contain powder charges. The modern bandolier carries the cartridges either
in loops sewn to the belt, or in small pouches, similarly attached,
containing strips of several cartridges. It has been extensively adopted in
the British army, especially for mounted troops.
