BALDWIN V., the son of Sibylla (daughter of Amalric I.) by her first
husband, William of Montferrat, was the nominal king of Jerusalem from 1183
to 1186, under the regency of Raymund of Tripoli. His reign is marked by
the advance of Saladin and by dissensions between the government and Guy of
Lusignan.
