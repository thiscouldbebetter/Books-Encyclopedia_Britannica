BALRAMPUR, a town of British India near the river Rapti, 28 m. from Gonda,
in the Gonda district of the United Provinces. Pop. (1901) 16,723. It gives
its name to one of the largest _talukdari_ estates in the province. The
raja, Sir Drigbijai Singh K.C.S.I., was conspicuously loyal during the
Mutiny, and was rewarded with accessions of territory and hereditary
privileges. His death in 1882 gave rise to prolonged litigation and the
estate was thrown into chancery. The income is estimated at £120,000,
paying a revenue of £46,000. Numerous schools and hospitals are supported.
Balrampur contains a large palace, a handsome modern temple and an
Anglo-vernacular school.
