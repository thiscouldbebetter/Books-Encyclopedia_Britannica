BALTA, a town in the Russian government of Podolia, between the Dniester
and the Bug, 131 m. by rail N.N.W. of Odessa. It carries on a large trade
in cattle, horses and grain, and has two annual fairs, held at Whitsuntide
and in June. A variety of industries, such as tallow-melting, soap-boiling,
tile-making and brewing, are carried on. The Jews form a very considerable
part of the population, which in 1867 numbered 14,528, and in 1897, 23,393.
Balta was in great part destroyed by the Russians in 1780.
