BALLANTINE, WILLIAM (1812-1887), English serjeant-at-law, was born in
London on the 3rd of January 1812, being the son of a London
police-magistrate. He was educated at St Paul's school, and called to the
bar in 1834. He began in early life a varied acquaintance with dramatic and
literary society, and his experience, combined with his own pushing
character and acute intellect, helped to obtain for him very soon a large
practice, particularly in criminal cases. He became known as a formidable
cross-examiner, his great rival being Serjeant Parry (1816-1880). The three
great cases of his career were his successful prosecution of the murderer
Franz Müller in 1864, his skilful defence of the Tichborne claimant in 1871
and his defence of the gaekwar of Baroda in 1875, his fee in this last case
being one of the largest ever known. Ballantine became a serjeant-at-law in
1856. He died at Margate on the 9th of January 1887, having previously
published more than one volume of reminiscences. Serjeant Ballantine's
private life was decidedly Bohemian; and though he earned large sums, he
died very poor.
