BANDON, or BANDONBRIDGE, a market-town of county Cork, Ireland, in the
south-east parliamentary division, picturesquely situated in a broad open
valley on both sides of the river Bandon. Pop. (1901) 2830. It is 20 m.
S.W. of the city of Cork by the Cork, Bandon & South Coast railway. It is
an important agricultural centre and there are distilleries, breweries and
flour-mills. The open park of Castle Bernard (earl of Bandon), on the
riverside, is attractive, and 2 m. below Bandon on the river is
Innishannon, the head of navigation. Bandon was founded early in the 17th
century by Richard Boyle, earl of Cork, and was incorporated by James I. It
returned two members to the Irish parliament and thereafter one to the
Imperial parliament until 1885. After the destruction of the walls by the
Irish in 1689, Bandon long resisted the admission of Catholic inhabitants.
