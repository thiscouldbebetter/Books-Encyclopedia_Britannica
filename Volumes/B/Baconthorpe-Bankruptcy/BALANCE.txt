BALANCE (derived through the Fr. from the Late Lat. _bilantia_, an
apparatus for weighing, from _bi_, two, and _lanx_, a dish or scale), a
term originally used for the ordinary beam balance or weighing machine with
two scale pans, but extended to include (with or without adjectival
qualification) other apparatus for measuring and comparing weights and
forces. In addition to beam and spring balances (see WEIGHING MACHINES),
apparatus termed "torsion balances," in which forces are measured or
compared by their twisting moment on a wire, are used, especially in
gravitational, electrostatic and magnetic experiments (see GRAVITATION and
ELECTROMETER). The term also connotes the idea of equality or equalization;
_e.g._ in the following expressions: "balance," in bookkeeping, the amount
which equalizes the debit and credit accounts; "balance wheel," [v.03
p.0235] in horology, a device for equalizing the relaxing of a watch or
clock spring (see CLOCK); the "balancing of engines," the art of minimizing
the total vibrations of engines when running, and consisting generally in
the introduction of masses which induce vibrations opposed to the
vibrations of the essential parts of the engine.
