BADAGAS (literally "a Telugu man"), a tribe inhabiting the Nilgiri Hills,
in India, by some authorities declared not to be an aboriginal or jungle
race. They are probably Dravidian by descent, though they are in religion
Hindus of the Saiva sect. They are supposed to have migrated to the
Nilgiris from Mysore about A.D. 1600, after the breaking up of the kingdom
of Vijayanagar. They are an agricultural people and far the most numerous
and wealthy of the hill tribes. They pay a tribute in grain, &c., to the
Todas. Their language is a corrupt form of Kanarese. At the census of 1901
they numbered 34,178.
