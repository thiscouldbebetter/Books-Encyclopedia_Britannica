BAKEWELL, ROBERT (1725-1795) English agriculturist, was born at Dishley,
Leicestershire, in 1725. His father, a farmer at the same place, died in
1760, and Robert Bakewell then took over the management of the estate. By
visiting a large number of farms all over the country, he had already
acquired a wide theoretical knowledge of agriculture and stock-breeding;
and this knowledge he now put to practical use at Dishley. His main object
was to improve the breed of sheep and oxen, and in this he was highly
successful, his new Leicestershire breed of sheep attaining within little
more than half a century an international reputation, while the Dishley
cattle (also known as the new Leicestershire long-horn) became almost as
famous. He extended his breeding experiments to horses, producing a new and
particularly useful type of farm-horse. He was the first to establish the
trade in ram-letting on a large scale, and founded the Dishley Society, the
object of which was to ensure purity of breed. The value of his own stock
was quickly recognized, and in one year he made 1200 guineas from the
letting of a single ram. Bakewell's agricultural experiments were not
confined to stock-breeding. His reputation stood high in every detail of
farm-management, and as an improver of grass land by systematic irrigation
he had no rival. He died on the 1st of October 1795.
