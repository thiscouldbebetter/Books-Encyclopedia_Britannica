BAGNÈRES-DE-LUCHON, a town of south-western France, in the department of
Haute-Garonne, 87 m. S.S.W. of Toulouse, on a branch line of the Southern
railway from Montréjeau. Pop. (1906) 3448. The town is situated at the foot
of the central Pyrenees in a beautiful valley at the confluence of the One
and the Pique. It is celebrated for its thermal springs and as a
fashionable resort. Of the promenades the finest and most frequented are
the Allées d'Etigny, an avenue planted with lime-trees, at the southern
extremity of which is the Thermes, or bathing-establishment, one of the
most complete in existence. The springs, which number 48, vary in
composition, but are chiefly impregnated with sulphate of sodium, and range
in temperature from 62° to 150°. A large casino was opened in the town in
1877. The discovery of numerous Roman remains attests the antiquity of the
baths, which are identified with the _Onesiorum Thermae_ of Strabo. Their
revival in modern times dates from the latter half of the 18th century, and
was due to Antoine Mégret d'Etigny, _intendant_ of Auch.
