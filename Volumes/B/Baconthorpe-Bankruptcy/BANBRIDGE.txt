BANBRIDGE, a town of Co. Down, Ireland, in the west parliamentary division,
on the Bann, 23 m. S.W. of Belfast on a branch of the Great Northern
railway, standing on an eminence. Pop. of urban district (1901) 5006. To
mitigate a steep ascent, a central carriage-way, 200 yds, long, is cut
along the main street to a depth of 15 ft., the opposite terraces being
connected by a bridge. Banbridge is an entirely modern town. It is the
principal seat of the linen trade in the county, and has extensive cloth
and thread factories, bleachfields and chemical works. A memorial in Church
Square commemorates the Franklin expedition to the discovery of the
North-West Passage, and in particular Captain Francis Crozier, who was born
at Banbridge in 1796 and served on the expedition.
