BAILY, WILLIAM HELLIER (1819-1888), English palaeontologist, nephew of
E. H. Baily the sculptor, was born at Bristol on the 7th of July 1819. From
1837 to 1844 he was Assistant Curator in the Bristol Museum, a post he
relinquished to join the staff of the Geological Survey in London. In 1854
he became assistant naturalist, under Edward Forbes and afterwards under
Huxley. In 1857 he was transferred to the Irish branch of the Geological
Survey, as acting palaeontologist, and retained this post until the end of
his life. He was the author of many papers on palaeontological subjects,
and of notes on fossils in the explanatory memoirs of the Geological Survey
of Ireland. He published (1867-1875) a useful work entitled _Figures of
Characteristic British Fossils, with Descriptive Remarks_, of which only
the first volume, dealing with palaeozoic species, was issued. The figures
were all drawn on stone by himself. He died at Rathmines near Dublin on the
6th of August 1888.
