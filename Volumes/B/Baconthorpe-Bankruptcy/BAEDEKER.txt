BAEDEKER, KARL (1801-1859), German publisher, was born at Essen on the 3rd
of November 1801. His father had a printing establishment and book-shop
there, and Karl followed the same business independently in Coblenz. Here
he began to issue the first of the series of guide-books with which his
name is associated. They followed the model of the English series
instituted by John Murray, but developed in the course of years so as to
cover the greater part of the civilized world, and later were issued in
English and French as well as German. Baedeker's son Fritz carried on the
business, which in 1872 was transferred to Leipzig.
