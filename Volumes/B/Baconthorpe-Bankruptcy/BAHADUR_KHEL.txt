BAHADUR KHEL, an Indian salt-mine in the Kohat district of the North-West
Frontier Province, in the range of hills south of the village of Bahadur
Khel between Kohat and Bannu. For a space of 4 m. in length by a quarter of
a mile in breadth there exists an exposed mass of rock-salt with several
large hillocks of salt on either side. The quarries extend over an area 1
m. long by half a mile broad, and the salt is hewn out in large blocks with
picks and wedges. The Indian government formerly maintained a large
preventive establishment for the preservation of the revenue, but it was
withdrawn in 1898. Consumption of Kohat salt is restricted, on account of
its paying less duty, to the tracts lying to the north of the Indus and to
the frontier tribes. In 1903 the rate was fixed at R.1½ per maund, against
R.2 for the rest of India. The mines are under the control of the Northern
India Salt Department.
