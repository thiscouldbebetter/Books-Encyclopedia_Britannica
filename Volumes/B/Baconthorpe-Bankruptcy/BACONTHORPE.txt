BACONTHORPE [BACON, BACO, BACCONIUS], JOHN (d. 1346), known as "the
Resolute Doctor," a learned Carmelite monk, was born at Baconthorpe in
Norfolk. He seems to have been the grandnephew of Roger Bacon (Brit. Mus.
Add. MS. 19. 116). Brought up in the Carmelite monastery of Blakeney, near
Walsingham, he studied at Oxford and Paris, where he was known as
"Princeps" of the Averroists. Renan, however, says that he merely tried to
justify Averroism against the charge of heterodoxy. In 1329 he was chosen
twelfth provincial of the English Carmelites. He appears to have
anticipated Wycliffe in advocating the subordination of the clergy to the
king. In 1333 he was sent for to Rome, where, we are told, he first
maintained the pope's authority in cases of divorce; but this opinion he
retracted. He died in London in 1346. His chief work, _Doctoris resoluti
Joannis Bacconis Anglici Carmelitae radiantissimi opus super quattuor
sententiarum libris_ (published 1510), has passed through several editions.
Nearly three centuries later, it was still studied at Padua, the last home
of Averroism, and Lucilio Vanini speaks of him with great veneration.
