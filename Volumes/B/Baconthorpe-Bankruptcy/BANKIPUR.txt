BANKIPUR, an ancient village on the Hugli river in the Bengal Presidency,
near the modern Palta above Barrackpore. It has disappeared from the map,
but is famous as the principal settlement of the ill-fated Ostend Company,
the one great effort made by Germany to secure a foothold in India. The
Ostend Company was formed in 1722-1723, and with a capital of less than a
million sterling founded two settlements, one at Coblom (Covelong) on the
Madras coast between the English Madras and the Dutch Sadras, and the other
on the Hugli between the English Calcutta and the Dutch Chinsura. Both
English and Dutch were offended and in 1727, in order to obtain the
European guarantee for the Pragmatic Sanction, the court of Vienna resolved
to sacrifice the Company and suspended its charter. It became bankrupt in
1784 and ceased to exist in 1793. But in the meantime in 1733 the English
and Dutch stirred up the Mahommedan general at Hugli to pick a quarrel. He
attacked Bankipur and the garrison of only fourteen persons set sail for
Europe. Thus German interests disappeared from India.
