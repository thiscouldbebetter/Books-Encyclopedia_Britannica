BALDINGER, ERNST GOTTFRIED (1738-1804), German physician, was born near
Erfurt on the 13th of May 1738. He studied medicine at Erfurt, Halle and
Jena, and in 1761 was entrusted with the superintendence of the military
hospitals connected with the Prussian encampment near Torgau. He published
in 1765 a treatise _De Militum Morbis_, which met with a favourable
reception. In 1768 he became professor of medicine at Jena, whence he
removed in 1773 to Göttingen, and in 1785 to Marburg, where he died of
apoplexy on the 21st of January 1804. Among his pupils were S. T.
Sömmerring and J. F. Blumenbach. Some eighty-four separate treatises are
mentioned as having proceeded from his pen, in addition to numerous papers
scattered through various collections and journals.
