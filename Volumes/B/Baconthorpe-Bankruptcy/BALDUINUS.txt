BALDUINUS, JACOBUS, Italian jurist of the 13th century, was by birth a
Bolognese, and is reputed to have been of a noble family. He was a pupil of
Azo, and the master of Odofredus, of Hostiensis, and of Jacobus de Ravanis,
the last of whom has the reputation of having first applied dialectical
forms to legal science. His great fame as a professor of civil law at the
university of Bologna caused Balduinus to be elected _podestà_ of the city
of Genoa, where he was entrusted with the reforms of the law of the
republic. He died at Bologna in 1225, and has left behind him some
treatises on procedure, the earliest of their kind.
