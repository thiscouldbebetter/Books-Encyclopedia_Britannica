BANDICOOT, any animal of the marsupial genus _Perameles_, which is the type
of a family _Peramelidae_. The species, about a dozen in number, are widely
distributed over Australia, Tasmania, New Guinea and several of the
adjacent islands. They are of small size and live entirely on the ground,
making nests of dried leaves, grass and sticks in hollow places and forming
burrows in which they pass a great part of the day. Though feeding largely
on worms and insects they ravage gardens and fields, on which account they
are detested by the colonists. The name is often extended to the family.
