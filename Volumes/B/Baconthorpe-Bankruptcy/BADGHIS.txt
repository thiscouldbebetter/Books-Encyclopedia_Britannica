BADGHIS ("home of the winds"), a district on the north-west of Afghanistan,
between the Murghab and Hari Rud rivers, extending as far northward as the
edge of the desert of Sarakhs. It includes the Chul formations through
which the Russo-Afghan boundary runs. This region was surveyed by the
boundary commission of 1885. Since that date it has been largely settled by
the amir with purely Afghan tribes.
