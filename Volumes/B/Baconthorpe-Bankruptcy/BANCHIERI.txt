BANCHIERI, ADRIANO (_c._ 1557-1634), Bolognese composer for church and
stage, organist, writer on music and poet. He founded the Accademia Florida
of Bologna. Like Orazio Vecchi he was interested in converting the madrigal
to dramatic purposes. He disapproved of the monodists with all their
revolutionary harmonic tendencies, about which he expressed himself
vigorously in his _Moderna Practica Musicale_ (Venice, 1613), while
systematizing the legitimate use of the monodic art of thorough-bass.
