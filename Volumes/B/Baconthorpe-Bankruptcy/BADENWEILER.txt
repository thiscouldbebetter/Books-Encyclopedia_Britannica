BADENWEILER, a health resort and watering place of the grand-duchy of
Baden, Germany, 28 m. N. by E. by rail from Basel, at the western edge of
the Black Forest. It is sheltered by the Blauen (3820 ft.) and the climate
is excellent. Its new parish (Evangelical) church (1897) is built at the
foot of the 11th-century castle which belonged to the margraves of Baden,
and was destroyed by the French during the wars of Louis XV. The place is
visited by 5000 people annually, partly for its warm mineral springs (70°
F.), partly for its whey cure, and partly on account of its equable climate
and picturesque surroundings. There are a _Kurhaus_, built in 1853, and a
park of 15 acres; also a grand-ducal castle, refitted in 1887-1888. In 1784
well-preserved Roman baths were discovered here. The permanent population
is about 600.
