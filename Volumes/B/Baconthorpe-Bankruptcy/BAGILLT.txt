BAGILLT, a town of Flintshire, North Wales, 14½ m. from Chester, on the
London & North Western railway, in the ancient parish of Holywell. Pop.
(1901) 2637. Its importance is due to its zinc, lead, iron, alkali and
kindred works, and its collieries. Above Bagillt is Bryn Dychwelwch, "Hill
of Retreat," so called from the retreat effected by Owen Gwynedd, when
pursued by Henry II., with superior numbers. Near is Mostyn Hall, dating
from the time of Henry VI., the seat of one of the oldest Welsh families.
Here are antiquities and MSS. (old British history and Welsh, brought from
Gloddaeth), a harp dated 1568, torques (_torchau_), &c. Henry VII., then
earl of Richmond, is said to have been concealed here in the reign of
Richard III., when the lord of Mostyn was Richard ap Howel.
