BAIRD, JAMES (1802-1876) Scottish iron-master, was born at Kirkwood,
Lanarkshire, on the 5th of December 1802, the son of a coal-master. In 1826
his father, two brothers and himself leased coalfields at Gartsherrie and
in the vicinity, and in 1828 iron mines near by, and in 1830 built blast
furnaces. In this year the father retired, the firm of William Baird & Co.
was organized, and James Baird assumed active control. His improvements in
machinery largely increased the output of his furnaces, which by 1864 had
grown in number to nearly fifty, producing 300,000 tons annually and
employing 10,000 hands. The brothers became great landowners, and James was
M.P. for the Falkirk burghs in 1851-1852 and 1852-1857. He died at his
estate near Ayr on the 20th of June 1876, leaving property valued at three
million pounds. He had been during his life a great public benefactor,
founding schools and the Baird Lectures (1871) for the defence of orthodox
theology, and in 1873 the Baird Trust of £500,000 to enable the Established
Church of Scotland to cope with the spiritual needs of the masses. He was
twice married but left no children.
