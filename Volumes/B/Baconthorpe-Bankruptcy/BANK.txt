BANK,[1] known also as "Polish Bank" and "Russian Bank" a card-game. An
ordinary pack is used. Five or six players is a convenient number. Each
contributes an arranged stake to the pool. The dealer gives three cards to
each player and turns up another; if this is not lower than an eight (ace
is lowest) he goes on till such a card is exposed. The player on the
dealer's left, without touching or looking at his cards, can bet the amount
of the pool, or any part of it, that among his cards is one that is higher
(of the same suit) than the turn-up. If he wins, he takes the amount from
the pool; if he loses, he pays it to the pool. Each player does the same in
turn, the dealer last. Whenever the pool is exhausted, a fresh stake is put
into the pool. After a round is over the deal passes. No player may touch
his cards until he has made his bet; the penalty is a fine to the pool of
twice the stake, and the loss of his right to bet during that round.
