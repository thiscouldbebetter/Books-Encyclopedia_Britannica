NEW HAMPSHIRE, a North Atlantic state of the United 
States, one of the New England group, and one of the Original 
Thirteen, lying between latitudes 42 40' and 45 18' 23* N., and 
between longitudes 70 37' and 72 37' W. It is bounded N. 
by the Canadian province of Quebec; E. by Maine, by the 
Salmon Falls river, which separates it in part from Maine, and 
by the Atlantic Ocean; S.E. and S. by Massachusetts; W. and 
N.W. by Vermont (from which it is separated by the Connecticut 
river — low water mark on the W. bank of the Connecticut is 
New Hampshire's W. boundary), and by Halls Stream which 
separates it from Quebec. The state has an area of 9341 sq. m., 
of which 310 sq. m. are water surface. 

Physical Features. — The, delightful scenery of mountains, 
lakes, streams and woodlands gives to the greater part of New 
Hampshire, which is in the New England physiographic province^ 
the appearance of a vast and beautiful park; and the state is a 
favourite summer resort. In the N. central portion, the White 
Mountains, a continuation of the Appalachian system, rise very 
abruptly in several short ranges and in outlying mountain masses 
from a base level of 700-1500 ft. to generally rounded summits, 
the heights of several of which are nowhere exceeded in the eastern 
part of the United States except in the Black and the Unaka 
mountains of North Carolina; seventy-four rise more than 
3000 ft. above the sea, twelve more than 5000 ft., and the 
highest, Mount Washington, attains an elevation of 6293 ft. 

The principal ranges, the Presidential, the Franconia and the 
Carter-Moriah, have a north-eastern and south-western trend. 
The Presidential, in the north-eastern part of the region, is separated 
from the Franconia on the south-west by the Crawford, or White 
MountainNotch, about 2000 ft. in depth, in which theAmmonoosuc 
and Saco rivers find a passage, and from the Carter-Moriah, parallel to 
it on the east, by the Glen-Ellis and Peabody rivers, the former 
noted for its beautiful falls. On the Presidential range, which is 
about 20 m. in length, are Mount Washington and nine other peaks 
exceeding 5000 ft. in height: Mount Adams, 5805 ft.; Mount 
Jefferson, 5725 ft!; Mount Sam Adams, 5585 ft.; Mount Clay, 
5554 ft-; Boot Spur, 5520 ft.; Mount Monroe, 5390 ft.; J. Q. 
Adams Peak, 5384 ft.; Mount Madison, 5380 ft.; and Mount 
Franklin, 5028 ft. On the Franconia, a much shorter range, are 
Mount Lafayette, 5269 ft.; Mount Lincoln, 5098 ft.; and four others 
exceeding 4000 ft. The highest peak on the Carter-Moriah range 
is Carter Dome, 4860 ft., but seven others exceed 4000 ft. Loftiest 
of the isolated mountains is Moosilanke noted for its magnificent 
view-point 4810 ft. above the sea. Separating Franconia and 
Pemigewasset ranges is the romantic Franconia Notch, overlooking 
which from the upper cliffs of Profile Mountain is a remarkable 
human profile, The Great Stone Face, immortalized by Nathaniel 
Hawthorne; here, too, is the Franconia Flume, a narrow upright 
fissure, 60 ft. in height, with beautiful waterfalls. 

The whole White Mountain region abounds in deep narrow 
valleys, romantic glens, ravines, flumes, waterfalls, brooks and lakes. 
The part of the state which lies N. of the White Mountains is 
occupied by ridges and wide rolling valleys, the ridges rising occa- 
sionally to heights of 2000 ft. or more. South of the mountains a 
plateau-like surface-ya part of the New England Uplands — broken 
by residual mountains, or " monadnocks " (a term derived from 
Mount Monadnock, 3186 ft. high, near the S.W. corner of the state) 
and lenticular hills, or drumlins, but having a general S.E. slope 
toward the sea, extends from the intervales of the Connecticut 
river to the E. border of the Merrimac Valley. Between the Merri- 
mac Valley and the sea is the only low surface in the state; .a 
considerable portion of this region is less than 500 ft. above the sea, 
but even here are numerous ndges 1000 ft. in height or more, and 
small drumlins. The seashore, about 18 m. in length, is forthe 
most part a low sandy beach; here and there, however, especially 
to the northward, it is somewhat rocky, and to the southward are 
two bluffs. The only harbour is at Portsmouth near the mouth of 
the Piscataqua. About 9 m. from the shore are the bleak and 
nearly barren Isles of Shoals, nine in number, a part of which belong 
to New Hampshire and a part to Maine. 

Extending from Mount Monadnock in Cheshire, the S.W. corner 
county, to the headwaters of the Connecticut river in the N.E. 
corner is a water-parting, W. of which the state is drained southward 
into Long Island Sound by the Connecticut and its tributaries and 
E. of which it is drained south-eastward into the Atlantic Ocean 
principally by the Merrimac in the S., the Saco and the headwaters 
of the Merrimac in the White Mountain region, and the Andro- 
scoggin in the N. The Piscataqua is a tidal estuary fed chiefly by 
the Salmon Falls, Lamprey and Exeter rivers. The headwaters of 
the rivers are for the most part mountain streams or elevated lakes; 
farther on .their swift and winding currents — flowing sometimes 
between wide intervales, sometimes between rocky banks — are 
marked by numerous falls and fed by lakes. 

The lakes and ponds, numbering several hundred, were formed 
by glacial action and the scenery of many of them is scarcely less 
attractive than that of^ the mountains. The largest and most 
widely known is Lake Winnepesaukee on the S. border of the White 
Mountain region ; this is about 20 m. long and from 1 to 8 m. wide, 
is dotted by 274 islands, mostly verdant, and has clear water and a 
rather level shore, back of which hills or mountains rise on all sides. 
Among the more prominent of many others that are admired for 
their beauty are Squam, New Found, Sunapee and Ossipee, all 
within a radius of a few miles from Winnepesaukee; Massabesic 
farther S. ; and Diamond Ponds, Umbagog and Connecticut lakes, 
N. of the White ^Mountains. The rivers with their numerous falls 
and the lakes with their high altitudes furnish a vast amount of 
water power for manufacturing, the Merrimac, in particular, into 
which many of the larger lakes, including Winnepesaukee, find an 
outlet, is one of the greatest power-yielding streams of the world. 

Flora. — Except on the summits of the higher mountains New 
Hampshire was originally an unbroken forest of which the principal 
trees were the white pine, hemlock, sugar maple, yellow birch, 
beech, red oak, and white oak in the S., red spruce, balsam, and 
white birch on the upper mountain slopes, and red spruce, white 
pine, sugar maple, white spruce and white cedar in the other parts 
of the N. The primeval forests have nearly disappeared, but 
much of the N. third of the state and many abandoned farms in the 
S. have become reforested with much the same trees, except that 
on the lower levels in the N. yellow birch, sugar maple and beech 
have to a considerable extent supplanted spruce, white pine and 
hemlock, and that wherever forest fires have occurred there is much 
bird cherry, yellow birch and aspen. The butternut, hickory and 
chestnut are common nut-bearing trees in the S. Among indigenous 
fruit-bearing trees, shrubs and vines the state has the bird cherry, 
black cherry, blueberry, cranberry, raspberry, blackberry, goose- 
berry, strawberry, grape and black currant; and conspicuous 
among a very great variety of shrubs and flowering plants are 
the rose, dogwood, laurel, sumac, holly, winterberry, trilliums, 
anemones, arbutuses, violets, azaleas, eglantine, clematis, blue 
gentians, orange lilies, orchids, asters and golden rod. The sum- 
mits of some of the mountains are too high for trees and above belts 
of dwarf spruce, balsam and birch they are clothed chiefly with 
sandworts, diapensia, cassiope, rushes, sedges and lichens. 

Fauna. — The N. section of the state was originally a favourite 
hunting-ground of the Indians, for here in abundance were the 
moose, caribou, deer, wolf, bear, lynx, otter, beaver, fox, sable, 
mink, musk-rat, porcupine, wood-chuck, ruffed grouse and pigeon. 
These were rapidly reduced in number by the white man, the wild 
pigeons are extinct, and the moose, caribou, bear, wolf, lynx and 
beaver have become rare, but, under the protection of laws enacted 
during the latter part of the 19th century, deer and ruffed grouse 
are again quite plentiful. Rabbits, squirrels, raccoons, woodcock 
and quail are also common game. Many of the lakes and rivers 
have been stocked with trout and salmon or bass; some, with 
smelt; the fresh waters of the state also contain pickerel, perch, 
pouts, eels, suckers, dace, sunfish and shiners. In the S. half of 
New Hampshire are many song birds belonging to the Alleghany 
faunal area; in the N. part many others belonging to the Canadian 
faunal area. The hermit thrush, veery, song sparrow, red -eyed 
vireo, bunting, warbler and wren are among the song birds of the 
forests. 

Climate. — The winters are usually long and severe, and the summers 
cool and salubrious, but the diversity of surface together with un- 
equal distances from the sea cause marked variations for the different 
regions. The mean annual temperature ranges from about 42 ° F. 
at only moderate elevations in the White Mountain region and 
farther N. to 47 F. at low altitudes in the S.E. The greatest 
extremes of temperature occur in the deep mountain valleys where 
it sometimes rises to 102 F. or above, in summer, and falls to-38°F. 
or below in winter; higher up on the mountains it is never so 
warm and along the sea-coast both extremes are considerably less. 
The highest recorded winter mean is 25 F., at Nashua in the lower 
valley of the Merrimac, and at Durham near the sea-coast; the 
lowest recorded winter mean is 18 F., at Bethlehem 1470 ft. above 
the sea in the White Mountain region; the highest recorded summer 
mean is 69 F. at Nashua, and the lowest recorded summer mean is 
64 F. at Bethlehem. The mean annual precipitation for the entire 
state is about ao in.; it is 43 in. at Nashua, 45*3 in. at Durham, 
and perhaps still more on the E. slopes of the mountain ranges, but 
it is only 37*7 in. at Bethlehem in the N.W. part of the mountain 
region and only 35*5 in. at Stratford in the upper valley of the 
Connecticut. The distribution is quite even throughout the year, 
but summer and autumn are slightly more wet than winter and 
spring. Among the mountains and in the N. part of the state the 
annual fall of snow is from 7 to 8 ft., but in the S.E. corner it is 
little more than one-half that amount. The prevailing winds are 
generally N.W., but in the vicinity of the sea they are S.E. during 
summer. 

Agriculture. — Fertile soil in New Hampshire is confined 
largely to the bottom-lands of the Merrimac and Connecticut 
rivers, where on deposits of glacial drift, which are generally 
quite deep in the southern half of the state, there is considerable 
alluvium. In the south-eastern section is also a moderately 
productive soil derived largely from the disintegration of slate. 
Elsewhere south of the mountains the surface soil is mostly 
hard pan or till, this being deepest on the drumlins. In the 
mountain region the soil is mostly a sandy loam composed of 
disintegrated granitic gneiss and organic matter; on the lower 
and more gentle slopes as weU as in the valleys this is generally 
deep enough for a luxuriant vegetable growth but on the upper 
and more precipitous slopes it is thin, or the rocks are entirely bare. 

Farms in the more sterile parts of New Hampshire were 
abandoned when the depleted soil and the old methods of 
agriculture made it impossible for owners or tenants to compete 
with western farmers. This abandonment led in 1889 to the 
adoption by the state Board of Agriculture of measures which 
promoted the development of the state, especially the central 
and northern parts, as a summer resort. Abandoned farms 
were advertised as suitable for country homes, and within 
fifteen years about two thousand were bought; and the carriage 
roads were improved, game preserved and the interests of visitors 
studied. Agriculture on the farms still operated was now 
greatly modified, and the production of vegetables, fruits, dairy 
products, poultry and eggs was largely substituted for the 
production of cereals. The total acreage of all land included in 
farms increased from 3,459,018 acres in 1890 to 3,609,784 acres 
in 1900, or from 60% to 62-6% of the total land area of the 
state, but the improved portion of this decreased during the 
decade from 1,727,387 acres to 1,076,879 acres, or from 49*9% 
to -20*8%; in no other state east of the Mississippi river was 
so small a proportion of the farm land improved at the close of 
the decade, although in Florida it was only a trifle larger. The 
total number of farms increased from 29,151 in 1890 to 29,324 
in 1900, and the average size increased from 119 acres to 123-1 
acres, but as a result of the more intensive form of agriculture, 
farms containing less than 50 acres increased from 8188 in 1890 
to 8764 in 1000, and those containing 50 acres or more decreased 
during this decade from 20,963 to 20,560. Of the total number 
of farms in 1900, 26,344, or 89-8%, were operated by owners or 
part owners, 1639 by cash tenants and 546 by share tenants. 

Hay is the principal crop; in 1909 the acreage was 640,000 
acres and the yield was 621,000 tons. The total acreage of cereals 
decreased from 88,559 acres in 1879 to 61,498 acres in 1889, and to 
42,335 acres in 1899; during the latter decade that of Indian corn 
increased from 23,746 acres to 25,694 acres (30,000 acres in 1909), 
but that of oats decreased from 26,618 acres to 12,589 acres (14,000 
acres in 1909), that of wheat decreased from 2027 acres to 271 
acres (none reported in 1909), that of barley decreased from 4934 
acres to 1596 acres (2000 acres in 1909), that of buckwheat decreased 
from 31 17 acres to 1835 acres (2000 acres in 1909), and that of rye 
decreased from 1056 acres to 350 acres (none reported in 1909). 
With the exception of dairy cows and horses there was likewise a 
corresponding decrease in the number of livestock during these 
years: the number of hogs decreased from 58,585 in 1890 to 56,970 
in 1900 (51,000 in 1910); of sheep, from 2 11,825 in 1880 to 105,702 
in 1900 (74,000 in 19 10); and of neat cattle other than dairy cows, 
from 141,841 in 1880 to 116,835 * n I 9°° (93.°°° * n I 9 10 ); out the 
number of horses increased from 52,458 in 1890 to 77,233 in 1900 
(59,000 in 1910), and the number of dairy cows from 90,564 in 1890 
to 115,036 in 1900 (122,000 in 1910). The value of the poultry and 
egg product of 1899 was $1,824,399, which was more than twice 
that of the cereals and nearly one-third of that of the hay and 
forage. The potato crop of the same year was grown on 19,422 
acres and amounted to 2,420,668 bushels valued at $1,090,495; in 
1909 the acreage was 21,000, and the crop was 2,730,000 bushels, 
valued at $1,747,000. The acreage of other vegetables in 1899 was 
26,780 and the value of the market garden produce, including small 
fruits, which was sold, increased from $187,049 in 1880 to $394, 283 
in 1899 or 1 io-8%. Although the crop of orchard fruits was no 
greater in 1899 than in 1889 the number of apple trees increased 
during the decade from 1,744,779 to 2,034,308, the number of peach 
trees from 19,057 to 48,819 and the number of plum trees from 
10,151 to 18,137; in the number of pear trees and of cherry trees 
there was a slight decrease. The fruit crop of 1899 included 
1,978,797 bushels of apples, 19,341 bushels of pears, 6054 bushels 
of peaches, 4942 bushels of plums, 1 183 bushels of cherries, 487,500 lb 
of grapes, 568,640 qts. of strawberries, 124,760 qts. of raspberries 
and 105,290 qts. of blackberries and dewberries. The valley of the 
Merrimac is the leading section for the production of hay, small 
fruits and dairy products. In the bottom lands of the Merrimac 
and of the Connecticut, south of the White Mountain's, a large part 
of the Indian corn and vegetables is grown. Potatoes, however, 
are grown in large quantities north and west of the White Mountains ; 
and this district leads in the number of cattle and sheep, and in the 
production of all the cereals except Indian corn. Apples, pears and 
grapes are successfully grown throughout the central and southern 
sections, but peaches and cherries chiefly south of Lake Winne^ 
pesaukee. Hillsboro and Rockingham counties, in the south-east, 
lead in the production of poultry and eggs. 

Forests. — -The White Mountain region and Coos county to the 
north of it, embracing in all nearly one-third of the total area of the 
state, is essentially a forest country. In 1903, however, only about 
12% of this was still occupied by a virgin merchantable forest and 
69*8% was cut-over or culled land. In the southern part of the 
state there is in the aggregate nearly as large an area of young 
forests on lands, most of which were until about 1850 used for 
agricultural purposes. The principal merchantable timber of the 
state is red spruce, and this is found chiefly in the virgin forests 
which remain in the north, especially in those on the steep mountain 
slopes between elevations of 1800 ft. and 3500 ft. All except a few 
scattered trees of the white pine, which was once abundant in all 
parts of the state below 1500 ft. in elevation, has been cut; but 
some of the second growth in the south is already merchantable. 
The most common hardwood trees are sugar maple, yellow birch, 
white birch and beech; these are widely distributed throughout 
the state, but are for the most part too young to be cut for lumber. 
White cedar is almost wholly confined to the swamps of the north, 
and white oak is found chiefly on the more fertile lands of the 
south. Most of the virgin forests of the northern section were cut 
in the latter half of the 19th century, while abandoned farms in 
the south were becoming reforested, and the value of the state's 
lumber and timber products increased from $1,099,492 in 1850 to 
$4,286,142 in 1870, and to $9,218,310 in 1900 and then decreased 
to $7,519,431 in 1905; since 1890 large quantities of wood, 
chiefly spruce, have also been used in the manufacture of paper and 
wood pulp. In 1909 a forestry commission was established. 

Fisheries. — Although the trout and salmon of the fresh waters in 
the interior are a great attraction to sportsmen, the commercial 
fisheries, which are confined to Rockingham county, on the coast, 
are of small and declining importance. The take of 1898 consisted 
chiefly of cod, haddock, lobsters, mackerel, alewives, pollock and 
hake, but was valued at only $48,987, which was a decrease of 67 % 
from that of 1889; in 1905 the total take was valued at $51,944, 
of which $32,575 was the value of lobsters and $8166 was the value 
of fresh cod — the only other items valued at more than $1000 were 
soft clams ($2770), Irish moss ($2400), alewives, fresh and salted 
($1220), and haddock ($1048). 

'Minerals. — The most important of the mineral products of New 
Hampshire, which has long^ been known as " the Granite State," 
is granite, which is quarried in the southern part of the state in the 
area of " Lake Winnepesaukee gneiss/' near Concord, Merrimack 
county, near Milford, Hillsboro county, and E. of Manchester in 
Rockingham county; in Sullivan county, near Sunapee; and in 
the east central part of the state in Carroll county, near Conway 
and Madison. In 1908 there were 8 quarries at Concord, all on 
Rattlesnake Hill, and all within 2 m. of the state house in Concord. 
The Concord granite is a medium bluish-grey coloured muscovite- 
biotite granite, with mica plates so abundant as to effect the dura- 
bility of the polish of the stone; it is used for building — the outer 
walls of the Library of Congress at Washington, D.C., are made of 
this stone — to a less degree for monuments, for which the output 
of one quarry is used exclusively, and for paving blocks. The out- 
put of the Milford quarries, which numbered in 1908 fifteen — twelve 
south and south-west and three north-west of Milford — consists of 
fine and mostly even-grained, quartz monzonites (i.e. granites with 
an unusually large proportion oi soda-lime feldspar), of various grey 
shades, sometimes tinged with blue, pink or buff, and always 
marked with black mica; the finer varieties take a high polish and 
are used for monuments, and the coarser grades are used for con- 
struction, especially of railway bridges, and for paving and curbing. 
The output of the Auburn quarry, 7 m. E. of Manchester, is a deep 
pink quartz monzonite, marked with fine black dots, which has a 
fine texture, takes a good polish and is used for monuments. The 
Conway quarries, four in number in 1908, are on either side of the 
Saco river, south-east and south-west of North Conway; their 
output is coarse constructional stones, all biotite or biotite-horn- 
blende, but varying in colour, pinkish (" red ") and dark- yellow 
greenish-grey (green ") varieties being found remarkably near 
each other at Redstone, on the east side of the Saco valley. About 
2 J m. E. of Sunapee are quarried two kinds of monumental stone: 
the " light Sunapee," a light bluish-grey biotite-muscovite, finer 
than the Concord granite, and capable of a good polish and of fine 
carving; and the " black pearl " or " dark Sunapee," a dark 
bluish-grey quartz-diorite, which seems black mottled with white 
when polished, and which is coarser than the " light Sunapee." 
New Hampshire granites were used for building as early as 1623. 
The value of granite quarried in the state increased from $195,000 
in 1887 to $1,147,097 in 1902, when building stone was valued at 
$619,916, monumental stone at $346,735 and paving stone at 
$101,548. In that year New Hampshire ranked fourth among the 
states in output of granite, with 6-3% of the total value of granite 
quarried in the entire country; in 1908 the value of granite 
($867,028) was exceeded by that of each of seven other states but 
was more than one-half of the total value of all mineral products 
of the state. Of this total the only other large items were clay and 
clay products (valued at $371,640), and mineral waters($259,^20; 
of which $150,512 was the value of table waters) from nine springy, 
four in Rockingham, three in Hillsboro county and one each in 
Coos and Carrol counties — and other mineral waters were used in 
the manufacture of soft drinks. Mica, first mined at Grafton, 
Grafton county, in 1803, found also in the northern part of Merri- 
mack county and in the north-western corner of Cheshire county in 
such quantities that for sixty years New Hampshire was the largest 
producer of mica in the United States, is no longer an important 
product: in 1907 its value ($7227) was less than that of the mica 
produced in South Dakota, Alabama, North Carolina or Colorado. 
A quartz schist, suitable for making whetstones and oilstones, was 
discovered in 1823 by Isaac Pike at Pike Station, Grafton county, 
and the Pike Manufacturing Company now owns and operates 
quarries outside this state also; in 1907 New Hampshire was the 
principal producer of scythe-stones in the United States, and the 
total value of. whetstones made in 1907 (including the value of 
precious stones 1 ) was $59,870. 

Manufactures. — The heavy precipitation on the elevated 
central and northern parts, and the hundreds of lakes and ponds 
which serve as reservoirs, give to the lower southern part of the 
state on the Merrimac and other rivers such an abundant and 
constant water-power that southern New Hampshire has become 
an important manufacturing district, and manufacturing has 
become the leading industry of the state. During the last two 
decades of the 19th century the number of inhabitants engaged 
in agricultural pursuits decreased from 45,122 to 38,782; and 
the number engaged in manufacturing and mechanical pursuits 
increased from 57,283 to 75,945. Many farmers abandoned their 
sterile farms and made new homes in the West, where soil 
yielded larger returns for labour, and a foreign-born popula- 
tion, consisting largely of French Canadians, came to the 
cities in response to the demand for labour in the mills and 
factories. 

From 1850 to i860 the value of the manufactured products 
increased 62-3%; in the decade of the Civil War they further 
increased in value 89%; from 1890 to 1900 the increase was from 
$85-770,549 to $118,709,308, or 38-4%; and from 1900 to 1905 
the value of the factory products increased from $107,590,803 to 
$123,610,904, or 14*9%. Textiles, and boots and shoes represented 

	1 Gems are not sought for systematically in New Hampshire. 
	Topaz occurs on Baldface Mountain, near North Chatham. 

in 1905 more than one-half the total value. Cotton goods, the 
manufacture of which was introduced in 1804, increased in value 
only slightly during the last decade of the 19th century, from 
$21,958,002 to $22,998,249, but from 1900 to 1905 their value 
increased 28-4%, or to $29,540,770; except in 1900 the manufacture 
of cotton goods had long ranked first, measured by the value of the 
product, among the state's manufacturing industries. Factory- 
made boots and shoes increased in value from $11,986,003 in 1890 
to $23,405,558 in 1900, or 95-3 %, the industry ranking^ first in 
1900; butin 1905 there was a decrease to $22,425,700, the industry 
then ranking second ; in 1900 the value of boots and shoes was 21-8% 
and in 1905 it was 18-1 % of the total value of all factory products, 
and in no other state was the degree of specialization in this in- 
dustry so great as in New Hampshire. Woollen goods, third in rank, 
decreased in value from $10,963,250 in 1890 to $10,381,056 in 1900, 
but the factory product increased in value from $7,624,062 in 1900 
to $11,013,982, in 1905, or 44-5%. Paper and wood pulp, for the 
manufacture of which the spruce forests of the state are so largely 
used, increased in value from $1,282,022 in 18^90 to $7,244,733 in 
1900, or 465-1 %, and to 188,930,291 in 1905; and this industry rose 
from ninth in rank in 1890 to fifth in 1900 and to fourth in 1905. 
The manufacture of lumber and timber products, one of the oldest 
industries of the state, ranked fifth in 1905; these products had 
increased in value from $5,641,445 in 1890 to $9,218,310 in 1900, 
or 63-4%, but decreased to $7,519,431 in 1005, the decrease being 
in large measure due to the great demand for spruce at the paper 
and pulp mills.. Foundry and machine shop products, hosiery and 
knit goods, wooden boxes, flour and grist mill products, and malt 
liquors are other important manufactures; the value of wooden 
boxes increased from $979,758 in 1900 to $2,565,612 in 1905, or 
161-9%, an d the value* of hosiery and knit goods increased during 
the same period from $2,592,829 to $3,974,290, or 5?-3%. As 
compared with other states of the Union, New Hampshire in 1905 
ranked fifth in the manufacture of factory-made boots and shoes, 
and in woollen goods, sixth in cotton goods, and seventh in paper 
and wood pulp, in hosiery and knit goods, and in the dyeing and 
finishing of textiles. In 1905 the value of the products in the eight 
cities of Manchester, Nashua, Concord, Dover, Rochester, Laconia, 
Keene, and Portsmouth, all of which are south of Lake Winne- 
pesaukee, was 50-5 % of that for the entire state. Nearly one-half 
the cotton goods were manufactured in Manchester. Boots and 
shoes were manufactured chiefly in cities near the southern border. 
Dover led in the manufacture of woollens; Laconia in the manu- 
facture of hosiery and knit goods; and Berlin, the chief manu- 
facturing centre north of the White Mountains, in the manufacture 
of paper and wood pulp. 

Transportation. — -With the exception of a Grand Trunk line in the 
northern part of the state the several steam railways are owned 
or leased by the Boston & Maine. Up the steep slope of Mount 
Washington runs a cog railway. The first steps in railway build- 
ing were taken in 1835, when the Boston & Maine, the Concord, 
and the Nashua & Lowell railways were incorporated. The Boston 
& Maine was opened from Boston, Mass., to Dover, N.H., in 1842. 
In 1850 there were in operation 467 m.; this mileage had increased 
to 1015 in 1880 and to 1167-14 on the 1st of January 1909. 
Portsmouth, the only port of entry, has a very small foreign trade, 
but there is a considerable traffic in coal and building materials 
here and on the Cocheco, which is navigable to Dover. 

Population. — The population of the state was 141,885 in 
1700; 183,858 in 1800; 214,460 in 1810; 244,161 in 1820; 
269,328 m 1830; 284,574 in 1840; 317,976 in 1850; 3 2 6,073 in 
i860; 318,300 in 1870; 346,991 in 1880; 376,530 in 1890; 
411,588 in 1900; and 430,572 in 19 10; the per cent of increase 
was 9*3 from 1890 to 1900 and 4-6 from 1900 to 1910. Of the 
total in 1900, 88,107 were foreign-born; 58,967, or 66-9%, were 
natives of Canada (44,420 French and 14,547 English), 13,547 
of Ireland, 5100 of England, 2019 of Scotland, 2006 of Germany, 
and 2032 of Sweden. Of the 323,481 native-born, 80,435, or 
24-8%, were natives of other states than New Hampshire; 
56,210 of these were natives of other New England states, 
however, and 7502 were natives of New York. At the same 
time there were 124,561 natives of New Hampshire numbered 
among the inhabitants of other states, principally Massachusetts, 
Vermont, Maine, New York, Illinois, California, Connecticut, 
Rhode Island, Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsyl- 
vania, Ohio, New Jersey, Kansas and Nebraska, and to induce 
these to return for a holiday season to their native state the 
" Old Home Week " festival, now held throughout New England, 
was planned in 1899 by Frank West RoDins (b. i860), who was 
then governor of New Hampshire. The Roman Catholic Church 
in 1906 had more members than any other religious denomination 
(119,863 out of 190,298 communicants of all denominations); 
in the same year there were 19,070 Congregationalists, 15,974 
Baptists, 12,529 Methodist Episcopalians (North) and 4892 
Protestant Episcopalians. Of the total population in 1890 the 
rural constituted 67-4% and the urban 37-6%, but in 1900 the 
rural constituted only 53-3% of the total and the urban 46-7%. 
The eleven cities having a population in 1900 of 5000 or 
more were: Manchester (56,987); Nashua (23,898); Concord 
(19,632) ; Dover (13,207) ; Portsmouth (10,637) ; Keene 
(9165); Berlin (8886); Rochester (8466); Laconia (8042); 
Somersworth (7023), and Franklin (5846). 

Administration. — New Hampshire was the first of the original 
thirteen states to establish a government wholly independent 
of Great Britain. This was designed to be only temporary, 1 
but was in operation from the 5th of January 1776 to the 2nd 
of June 1784. The constitution which then went into effect 
provided for a General Court consisting of a Senate and a House of 
Representatives and made the Council a body advisory to the 
state president; the 1784 instrument was much amended in 
1792, when the title of president was changed to governor, but 
with the amendments adopted in that year it is in large measure 
the constitution of to-day. For sixty years there was no change 
whatever, and only three amendments, those of 1852 (removing 
the property qualifications of representatives, senators and the 
governor), were adopted until 1877, when twelve amendments 
were adopted, — the most important being those providing for 
biennial (instead of annual) state elections in November (instead 
of March), and those doing away with the previous requirement 
that representatives, senators and the governor "be of the 
Protestant religion." Five amendments were ratified in 1889 
and four in 1902. New Hampshire is the only state in the 
Union in which amendments to the constitution may be proposed 
only by a constitutional convention, and once in seven years at 
the general election a popular vote is taken on the necessity of 
a revision of the constitution. A radical revision of the con- 
stitution is rendered especially difficult by a provision that no 
amendment proposed by a convention shall be adopted without 
the approval of two-thirds of the electors who vote on the 
subject when it is referred to them. Prior to 1002 every male 
inhabitant of a town who was twenty-one years of age or over, 
a citizen of the United States, and not a pauper or excused from 
paying taxes at his own request, had a right to vote, but an 
amendment adopted in this year made ability to read English 
and to write additional qualifications, except in the case of those 
physically unable to read or to write, of those then having the 
franchise, and of persons 60 years of age or more on the ist of 
January 1904. Various other amendments have been proposed 
from time to time, but have been defeated at the polls. 
By an act approved on the 9th of April 1009 provision was made 
for direct nominations of candidates at primaries conducted by 
regular election officers. 

There is a governor's council of five members, one from each 
councillor district, which has advisory duties and shares with the 
governor most of his powers. There is no lieutenant-governor. 
The governor and the councillors are elected for a term of two years, 
and a majority of the votes cast is necessary to a choice. Where 
no candidate receives such a majority the Senate and the House of 
Representatives by joint ballot choose one of the two having the 
greatest number. No person is eligible for either office who shall 
not at the time of his election be at least thirty years of age and 
have been an inhabitant of the state for the seven years next pre- 
ceding; a councillor must be an inhabitant of the^ district from 
which he is chosen. The governor and council appoint all judicial 

	1 The constitution of 1776 provided that the^ Congress which 
	framed it " assume the name, power and authority of a House of 
	Representatives " ; that said house choose twelve persons to be 
	" a distinct and separate branch of the legislature by the name of 
	a Council"; that the Council appoint a president; that civil 
	officers for the colony and for each county (except clerks of court, 
	county treasurers and recorders) should be appointed by the two 
	houses; and that "if the present unhappy dispute with Great 
	Britain should continue longer than this present ^ year, and the 
	Continental Congress give no instruction or direction to the con- 
	trary, the Council be chosen by the people of each respective county 
	in such manner as the Council and House of Representatives shall 
	order." A constitution framed by a Convention which met in 
	Concord on the 10th of June 1778 was rejected by the people in 
	1779. 

officers, the attorney-general, auditor, important administrative 
boards, coroners and certain naval and military officers; they have 
power to pardon offences; and they may exercise some control over 
expenditure through the constitutional requirement of the governor's 
warrant for drawing money from the treasury. The governor may 
veto within five days, besides Sunday, after it has been presented to 
him, any bill or resolution of which he disapproves, and a two-thirds 
vote of the members of both houses is required to pass over his veto. 

A Senate and a House of Representatives, which together constitute 
the General Court, meet at Concord on the first Wednesday in 
January of every odd-numbered year, and at such other times as 
the governor may appoint for a special session, principally for the 
making of laws and for the election of the secretary of state, the 
state treasurer, and the commissary-general. The Senate is com- 
posed of 24 members, one from each senatorial district, and these 
districts are formed so as to be approximately equal with respect 
to the amount of direct taxes paid in each; representation in this 
body is therefore apportioned on the basis of property. In the 
House of Representatives, which has the large membership of 390, 
representation is on the basis of population, but is so arranged as 
to favour the rural districts; thus every town or ward of a city 
having 600 inhabitants is allowed one representative, but, although 
for every additional representative 1200 additional inhabitants are 
required, any town having less than 600 inhabitants is allowed a 
representative for such proportionate part of the time the legislature 
is in session as the number of its inhabitants bears to 600. Senators 
and representatives are elected for a term of two years. A repre- 
sentative must have been an inhabitant of the state for at least 
two years next preceding his election, and must be an inhabitant of 
the town, parish or ward he is chosen to represent; a senator must 
be at least thirty years of age, must have been an inhabitant of the 
state for at least seven years next preceding his election, and must 
be an inhabitant of the district by which he is chosen. The con- 
stitution of New Hampshire places scarcely any restrictions on the 
powers of the legislature. By an amendment of 1877, however, it 
is forbidden to authorize any town to lend money or give credit 
for the benefit of any corporation whose object is profit. Although 
money bills may originate only in the House of Representatives the 
Senate may propose amendments. In 1909 the office of state 
auditor was created. 

For the administration of justice the state has a supreme court 
and a superior court, each county has a probate court, and some 
towns as well as the cities have a police court ^ The supreme court 
and the superior court consist each of one justice and four associate 
justices. The supreme court holds one general term each year at 
Concord and on the first Tuesday of every month except July and 
August sits to hear arguments, make orders and render decisions; 
the superior court holds one or two sessions a year in every county. 
Both of these courts have extensive jurisdiction. Each probate 
court, consisting of a single judge, has jurisdiction within its county 
of the probate of wills, of the granting of administration,^ in insol- 
vency proceedings, and in relation to the adoption of children; it 
may appoint and remove guardians of minors, insane persons and 
spendthrifts, and, upon application, may change a person's name. 
The court of a justice of the peace has jurisdiction in criminal cases 
only where the punishment is by fine not exceeding twenty dollars, 
or by imprisonment not exceeding six months, or by both, and in 
civil cases only where the title to real estate is not involved- and the 
damage demanded does not exceed thirteen dollars and thirty-three 
cents. A police court has the same jurisdiction as that of a justice of 
the peace, and, in addition, concurrent jurisdiction with the superior 
court in certain cases where the title to real estate is not involved 
and the damage demanded does not exceed one hundred dollars. 
Judges and justices are appointed by the governor and council, 
and with the exception of justices of the peace they hold office during 
good behaviour or until they have attained the age of seventy 
years; justices of the peace are appointed for a term of five years 
only, but they may be reappointed. 

Local affairs are administered by counties, towns (townships), vil- 
lage districts and cities. In each county a convention, composed of 
representatives from the towns, meets every two years to levy taxes 
and to authorize expenditures for grounds and buildings whenever 
more than one thousand dollars are required. For the discharge of 
other county functions the qualified electors of each county elect 
every two years three commissioners, a sheriff, a solicitor, a treasurer, 
a register of deeds and a register of probate ; two auditors also are 
appointed annually by the supreme court. The county commissioners 
have the care of county buildings, consisting chiefly of a court 
house, gaol and house of correction, but are not allowed to expend 
more than one thousand dollars for repairs, new buildings or grounds, 
without authority from the county convention; the commissioners 
have the care also of all other county property, as well as of county 
paupers; and once every four years they are required to visit each 
town of their county, inspect the taxable property therein, determine 
whether it is incorrectly assessed and report to the state board of 
equalization. In each town a regular annual meeting of the qualified 
electors is called on the second Tuesday in March for the transaction 
of miscellaneous business and the election of town officers. These 
officers always include three selectmen, a clerk, a treasurer and one 
or more auditors, and they may include any or all of the following; 
assessors, who together with the selectmen constitute a board for 
the assessment of taxes, one or more collectors of taxes, overseers 
of the poor, constables, surveyors of highways, fence-viewers, 
sealers 01 weights and measures, measurers of wood and bark, sur- 
veyors of lumber, cullers of staves, a chief fireward or engineer and 
one or more assistants, a clerk of the market and a pound keeper. 
The moderator of the town meeting is elected at the general election 
in November for a term of two years, and a board of health, consisting 
of three members, is appointed by the selectmen, one member each 
year. The general business of the town, other than that which comes 
before the town meeting, is managed by the selectmen, and they 
are specially intrusted with the regulation of the highways, side- 
walks and commons. A village district is a portion of a town, 
including a village, which is set apart and organized for protection 
from fire, for lighting or sprinkling the streets, for providing a 
water-supply, for the construction and maintenance of sewers, and 
for police protection; to serve these interests three commissioners, 
a moderator, a clerk, a treasurer and such other officers as the 
voters of the district may deem necessary are chosen, each for a 
term of one year.^ The government of cities is in part determined by 
general laws and in part by individual charters. In accordance with 
the general laws each city elects a mayor, a board of aldermen, and 
a common council in whom is vested the administration of its 
"fiscal, prudential and municipal affairs"; the mayor presides 
at the meetings of the board of aldermen, and has a veto on any 
measure of this body, and no measure can be passed over his veto 
except by an affirmative vote of at least two-thirds of all the alder- 
men; each ward elects three selectmen, a moderator and a clerk 
in whom is vested the charge of elections; the city marshal and 
assistant marshals are appointed by the mayor and aldermen, but 
the city clerk and city treasurer are elected by the aldermen and 
common council in joint session. 

Under the laws of New Hampshire the property rights of husband 
and wife are nearly equal. The wife may hold, acquire and manage 
property the same as if she were single; she is also subject to the 
same liabilities in relation to her property as a single woman except 
that no contract or conveyance by ner as surety or guarantor for 
her husband is binding. Rights of dower and courtesy both obtain. 
Where there is no will or its provisions are waived, the right of a 
widow, in addition to her dower and homestead rights, in the personal 
estate of a deceased husband is the same as that of a widower, in 
addition to his estate by courtesy and homestead right, in the 
personal estate of a deceased wife, i.e. one-half if there is no sur- 
viving issue and one-third if there is such issue. By releasing his or 
her right of dower or courtesy together with the homestead right, 
if any, the surviving widower or widow is also entitled, in fee, to 
one-half the real estate, if said deceased leaves no issue surviving; 
if the husband leaves issue by the widow surviving, she is entitled 
in fee to one-third of his real estate ; if the wife leaves issue by him 
surviving, the husband also is entitled in fee to one-third of her 
estate; but if the wife leaves issue not by him, he is entitled 
only to a life interest in one-third of her real estate. Among 
the grounds for a divorce are adultery, impotency, extreme 
cruelty, conviction of a crime punishable in the state with 
imprisonment for more than a year and actual imprisonment under 
such conviction, treatment seriously injuring the health or en- 
dangering the reason, wilful desertion for three years, or joining a 
religious sect or society which professes to believe the relation of 
husband and wife unlawful, and conduct in accordance therewith 
for six months. 

The homestead law of New Hampshire exempts from seizure for 
debt five hundred dollars' worth of any person's homestead except 
for the enforcement of a mortgage upon it, for the collection of 
debts incurred in making repairs or improvements, or for the col- 
lection of taxes. The law also provides that except where a mortgage 
is given to secure payment of the purchase money, the homestead 
right of a married person shall not be encumbered without the 
consent of both husband and wife. The surviving wife or husband 
and the minor children, if any, may occupy the homestead right , 
during the minority ol the children, and the surviving wife or 
husband is entitled to the right during the remainder of her or his 
lifetime. 

From 1855 to 1903 the liquor law was essentially prohibitory, 
but in the latter year an act licensing the traffic was passed. 
However, some option still remains with each town and city. 
Once every four years in cities and once in two years in towns 
the question of licence or no-licence must be submitted to a vote 
of the electorate, and in a no-licence town or city no bar-room 
or saloon is to be permitted; in such a town or city, however, 
malt liquor, cider and light wines may be sold at a railway 
restaurant and an inn-keeper may serve liquors to his bona-fide 
registered guests. 

Capital punishment for murder in the first degree is inflicted only 
upon the request of a jury. 

The general supervision of railways is vested in a board of three 
commissioners appointed by the governor and council for a term 
of three years, one each year. The board is specially directed to 
prescribe the manner in which the railway corporations shall keep 
their accounts, to examine these accounts from time to time, to 
examine the railways at least once a year, to investigate the cause of 
all accidents and upon the petition of an interested party to fix rates 
for the transportation of persons and freight. In 1909 an anti-pass 
law was enacted. 

Education. — New Hampshire formed a part of Massachusetts 
when, in 1647, the General Court of that province passed the 
famous act requiring every town in which there were fifty 
householders to maintain a school for teaching reading and 
writing, and every town in which there were one hundred house- 
holders to maintain a grammar school with an instructor capable 
of preparing young men for college. Although not much en- 
forced, this, with some slight changes, continued to be the school 
law until the close of the colonial era. The beginning of the new 
era was marked by the founding of Phillips Exeter Academy 
(1781), and later several other similar schools were opened. 
Their excellence aroused a much greater interest in the common 
school system, and throughout the 19th century various ex- 
periments for improving it were tried; among them were the 
division of towns -into districts, the appointment of county 
school commissioners, and the establishment of a state board 
of education. These, however, have been abandoned, and the 
system is now administered chiefly by towns and a few special 
districts under the general supervision of a state superintendent. 

Each town is constituted a school district, and some special 
districts are organized under special acts of the legislature. Some 
of the business relating to the schools is transacted at the annual 
district school meeting in which women as well as men have a vote, 
but the schools of each district are managed very largely by a school 
board elected at this meeting, one-third each year; in districts 
without a high school the board has only three members, but in 
districts having a high school the board may have three, six or 
nine members. The superintendent of public instruction is ap- 
pointed by the governor and council for a term of two years, and 
it is his duty to prescribe the form of register to be kept in the 
schools, to investigate the condition of the schools, to make sug- 
gestions and recommendations for improving them, to lecture upon 
educational subjects in the towns and cities, to hold at least one 
teachers' institute each year ineachof the counties, and to designate 
the times and places for holding examinations of those who wish 
to teach. The free school system now provides free high schools for 
all children within the state; for an act of 1903 requires any town 
not maintaining a high school, or school of corresponding grade, 
or not uniting with adjoining towns in maintaining one, to pay the 
tuition of any of its children who attend a high school or academy 
within the state. Evening schools for the instruction of persons 
over fourteen years of age must be established in any city or 
town of more than 5000 inhabitants if 5% of its legal voters 
petition for them. Any town upon application, and by contract- 
ing to appropriate annually a certain fixed sum for its mainten- 
ance, may receive state aid for establishing a library, and in 1904 
libraries had been established by this means in 146 towns. Every 
district is required to keep its schools open at least twenty weeks 
each year. 

All children between the ages of eight and fourteen and those 
between the ages of fourteen and sixteen who cannot read and write 
English are required to attend either a public or an approved private 
school for the full term unless excused by the school board on 
account of physical or mental infirmity. The schools are maintained 
chiefly out of the proceeds of a district school tax, which must not 
be less in any district than seven hundred and fifty dollars for every 
dollar of public taxes apportioned to the town or district, a pro- 
portion wnich has gradually increased from five to one in 1789 and 
from ninety to one in 1817. To this is added a" Literary Fund " 
(designed originally for founding a college) which is derived from 
the proceeds of a state tax on the deposits, stock, &c. of savings 
banks, trust companies, loan and trust companies, building and loan 
associations and other similar corporations not residing in the state, 
and a portion of the proceeds of a dog tax, both of which are dis- 
tributed among the several districts in proportion to the number 
of pupils not less than five years of age who have attended school at 
least two weeks. The state also makes appropriations for the pay- 
ment of a portion of the tuition in high schools and academies 
distributing it among the districts in proportion to the rate of school 
tax in each, appropriations for paying a portion of the salary of 
school superintendents where two or more districts unite to form a 
supervising district, and appropriations for general school pur- 
poses to be distributed among the districts according to the 
number of teachers trained in normal schools and to average school 
attendance. 

The plan of 182 1 to use the Literary Fund for founding and main- 
taining a state college for instruction in the higher branches of 
science and literature was abandoned in 1828 and the only state 
institutions of learning are the Plymouth Normal School (1870) at 
Plymouth, the Keene Normal School (1909) at Keene, and the New 
Hampshire College of Agriculture and ^fechanic Arts, organized as a 
department of Dartmouth College in 1866, but removed to Durham, 

Strafford county, as a separate institution in 1891. The normal 
schools are managed by a board of trustees consisting of the governor, 
the superintendent of public instruction and five other members 
appointed by the governor and council for a term of five years, one 
each year, and they are maintained out of annual state appropria- 
tions. The College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts is managed by 
a board of trustees consisting of the governor, the president of the 
college, one member chosen by the alumni, and ten members ap- 
pointed by the governor with the advice and consent of the council 
for a term of four years, and it is maintained out of the proceeds 
of grants by the United States government, annual state appropria- 
tions and a private endowment. The principal institutions of higher 
learning in the state are Dartmouth College (non-sectarian, opened 
in 1769), at Hanover, and Saint Anselm's College (Roman Catholic, 
opened in 1893), at Manchester. Dartmouth College receives some 
aid from the state. 

The state charitable and- correctional institutions consist of the 
New Hampshire .School for Feeble-minded Children, at Laconia; 
the New Hampshire Soldiers' Home, at Tilton ; the New Hampshire 
Industrial School, at Manchester; the New Hampshire Hospital 
for the Insane, and the State Prison, at Concord; and the New 
Hampshire Sanatorium for consumptives (1909) near Warren 
Summit, about 75 m. north of Concord. The state also makes 
annual appropriations for the care and education of blind and deaf 
and dumb persons in institutions outside of the state. Each county 
has an almshouse and house of correction. Here, too, many of the 
insane of the state were formerly confined; but by an act of 1903 
the counties were entirely relieved of this care, and the insane were 
removed to the state hospital. Within the state are also sixteen 
orphan asylums, and though these are private institutions, in all 
but one 01 them children are boarded at county or city expense. 
Each of the state institutions is under the management of an officer 
or board of trustees appointed by the governor and council. In 
1895 the legislature established a State Board of Charities and 
Correction. This consists of five members appointed by the governor 
and council for a term of five years, one each year, and its duties 
are chiefly advisory and supervisory. It is required to inspect both 
state and county charitable and < correctional institutions, except the 
state prison and the state hospital, to recommend such changes to 
the state government as may seem desirable, and^ to have a special 
care for dependent children whether in institutions or placed in 
permanent homes. 

Finance. — The income of the state, counties and towns is derived 
mainly from taxes levied on real estate, on male polls between the 
ages of twenty-one and seventy, on stock in public funds, on stock 
in corporations that pay a dividend and are not subject to some 
special form of tax, on surplus capital in banks, on stock in trade, 
on live-stock, on railways, on telegraph and telephone lines, on 
savings banks and on the stock of fire insurance companies. Except 
in the case of railways, telegraph and telephone lines, savings banks, 
building and loan associations and fire insurance companies, the 
taxes are assessed and collected by town officers, but every fourth 
year the county commissioners are required to inspect the taxable 
property in the towns and report any misappraisal to the state 
board of equalization whose duty it is to equalize the valuation of 
property in the several towns. This board, which is composed of 
five members appointed by the supreme court for a term of two 
years, also assesses the taxes on the railways, and on telegraph and 
telephone lines; for railways the average rate of taxation is assessed 
on the estimated actual value of the road beds, rolling stock and 
equipment, and for the telegraph and telephone lines this rate is 
assessed on the estimated actual value of the poles, wires, instru- 
ments, apparatus, office furniture and fixtures. Savings banks 
pay to the state treasurer a tax of three-fourths of 1 % upon the 
amount of deposits on which they pay interest ; building and loan 
associations pay to him a tax of three-fourths of I % upon the^ 
whole amount of their capital stock paid in or shares in force, less* 
the value of their real estate and loans secured by mortgages on 
real estate situated within the state and bearing interest not ex- 
ceeding 5%; and fire insurance companies pay to the same officer 
a tax of 1 % upon the amount of their paid-up capital. The railway 
tax is distributed as follows : one -fourth is paid to the towns through 
which the railways pass; such a portion of the remainder is paid 
to any town as is equal to the portion of stock owned in that town ; 
and what is left is reserved as a part of the statetax. Such a portion 
of 75 % °f the tax on fire insurance companies is distributed among 
the several towns, in proportion to the amount of stock owned in 
each, as the amount of stock owned within the state bears to the 
whole amount of stock, and the remainder is reserved as a part of 
the state tax. All taxes on savings banks are distributed to the 
towns in which the depositors reside, the tax on non-resident 
depositors constituting a Literary Fund which is distributed to the 
towns on the basis of the number of pupils in each. The whole tax 
received by the state treasurer from each building and loan associa- 
tion is paid by him to the treasurer of the town in which it is located. 
The state also derives an income from fees charged for chartering 
banks, railways, insurance companies and other corporations. The 
financial condition at the close of the War of Independence was 
alarming, and in September 1785 a mob at Exeter demanded relief 
through the issue of more paper currency. This was refused them 
however, and by the beginning of the Civil War the state was almost 
free of debt. During that war the state incurred an indebtedness 
of about $4,236,000; this it reduced to $2,205,695 in 1872, and 
then assumed the war debt of the towns and cities, making its total 
indebtedness again $4,138,124. On the 1st of September 1908 the 
funded debt of the state was $706,700. 

History.— Martin Pring was at the mouth of the Piscataqua 
in 1603 and, returning to England in the same year, gave an 
account of the New England coast from Casco Bay to Cape Cod 
Bay. Samuel de Champlain discovered the Isles of Shoals and 
sailed along the New Hampshire coast in 1605, and much more 
information concerning this part of the New World was gathered 
in 1 614 by Captain John Smith, who in his Description of New 
England refers to the convenient harbour at the mouth o'f the 
Piscataqua and praises the country back from the rocky shore. 
Under the leadership of Sir Ferdinando Gorges there was formed 
in 1620 the Council for New England, which procured from 
King James I. a grant of all the country from sea to sea between 
40 and 48\N. latitude, and which made the following grants 
bearing upon the history of New Hampshire by their inducement 
to settlement, by deterniining the boundaries or by causing 
strife through their conflicts with one another: to John Mason, 
who has been called " the founder of New Hampshire," on the 
9th of March 1622, a grant of the region between the Salem 
and Merrimac rivers, under the name of Mariana; to John 
Mason and Sir Ferdinando Gorges jointly, on the 10th of August 
1622, a grant of the region between the Merrimac and Kennebec 
rivers for 60 m. inland, under the name of the Province of Maine; 
to David Thomson and associates, in 1622, a grant of six thousand 
acres near the mouth of the Piscataqua; to Sir Henry Roswell 
and associates, on the 19th of March 1628, a grant of the region 
from 3 m. south of the Charles river, " or to the southward 
of any and every part thereof " to 3 m. N. of the Merrimac 
river, " or to the northward of any and every part thereof," 
and extending west to the South Sea or Pacific Ocean, under the 
name of Massachusetts; to John Mason alone, on the 7th of 
November 1629, a grant of that portion of the " Province of 
Maine " which lay between the Merrimac and the Piscataqua, 
under the name of New Hampshire; to the Laconia Company, 
consisting of Gorges, Mason and associates, on the 17th of 
November 1629, a grant of an extensive territory (which was 
called Laconia) around the Lake of the Iroquois (Lake Champlain) 
together with one thousand acres at some place to be selected 
along the sea coast; to Edward Hilton, on the 12th of March 
1630, the grant of a tract on and about the lower part of Dover 
Neck; to the Laconia Company, in November 1631, a grant 
of a tract on both sides of the Piscataqua river near its mouth, 
known as the Pescataway grant; and finally to John Mason, 
on the 22nd of April 1635, a short time before the Council 
surrendered its charter, a grant of the region between the 
Salem river on the south and the Piscataqua and Salmon Falls 
rivers on the north-east and extending 60 m. inland, under the 
name of New Hampshire. Mason died in December of this 
.year, and New Hampshire, unlike the other colonies from which 
the United States originated, New Jersey and Delaware excepted, 
never received a royal charter. 

The first settlement of which there is indisputable evidence 
was established in 1623 by David Thomson at Little Harbor, 
now in the town of Rye. Thomson was the head of a company 
which was organized for fishing and trading and whose entire 
stock was to be held jointly for five years. He built a house 
on Odiorne's Point overlooking Little Harbor, and, although 
he removed to an island in Boston Harbor in 1626, he may have 
continued to superintend the business of the company until the 
expiration of the five-year term. At least there was a settlement 
here which was assessed in 1628, and it may not have been 
completely abandoned when colonists sent over by the Laconia 
Company arrived in 1630. The Laconia Company received 
its'first grant under the erroneous impression that the Piscataqua 
river had its source in or near Lake Champlain, and its principal 
object was to establish an extensive fur trade with the Iroquois 
Indians. Although Lake Champlain could not be reached by 
boat up the Piscataqua, and although the enterprise was ulti- 
mately a failure, the company sent over colonists who occupied 
the house left standing by Thomson, and, not far away, built 
" Mason Hall " or the " Great House " in what is now Ports- 
mouth, a name (for the entire settlement) that replaced " Straw- 
berry Banke " in 1653. Edward Hilton with a few associates 
appears to have established a settlement on Dover Point about 
the time of Thomson's arrival at Little Harbor, and in the Hilton 
grant of 1630 it is stated that he had already built houses and 
planted there; as early as 1639 this settlement was named 
Dover. In 1638 the Rev. John Wheelwright, an Antinomian 
leader who had been banished) from Massachusetts, founded 
Exeter on land claimed to have been bought by him from the 
Indians. In the same year Massachusetts encouraged friendly 
Puritans to settle Hampton on the same purchase, and about 
a year later this colony organized Hampton as a town with the 
right to send a deputy to the General Court. Serious dissensions 
had already arisen between Puritan and Anglican factions in 
Dover, and Captain John Underhill, another Antinomian, 
became for a time a leader of the Puritan faction. Puritan 
Massachusetts was naturally hostile to the Antinomians at 
Exeter as well as to the Anglicans at Strawberry Banke. 
Although Exeter, in 1639, Dover, in 1640, and Strawberry 
Banke, not later than 1640, adopted a plantation covenant, 
these settlements were especially weak from lack of a superior 
tribunal, and appeals had been made to Massachusetts as early 
as 1633. Moreover, the grants of Massachusetts and Mariana 
were clearly in conflict. Under these conditions Massachusetts 
discovered a new claim for its northern boundary. The charter 
of that colony was drafted under the impression that the 
Merrimac flowed east for its entire course, but now an investiga- 
tion was in progress which was to show that its source in Lake 
Winnepesaukee was several miles north of any of the four 
settlements in New Hampshire. Accordingly, Massachusetts 
resolved to make the most of the clause in the charter which 
described the northern boundary as three English miles north 
of the Merrimac river, "or to the northward of any and every 
part thereof," to ignore the conflicting grants to Mason and to 
extend its jurisdiction over the offending settlements. Dover 
submitted in 1641, Strawberry Banke (Portsmouth) soon after- 
wards and Exeter in 1643. 

The heirs of Mason protested, but little was done about the 
matter during the period of Puritan ascendancy in the mother 
country. Immediately after the resignation of Richard Cromwell, 
however, Robert Tufton Mason (a grandson of the original 
proprietor), who had become sole heir in 1655, began petitioning 
first parliament and later the king, for relief. The attorney- 
general, to whom the petition to the king was referred, reported 
that the petitioner had a " good and legal right and title to the 
lands." The commission appointed by the king in 1664 to 
hear and determine complaints in New England decided that 
Mason's lands were not within the jurisdiction of Massachusetts, 
and made an attempt to set up a government under which his 
claims could be tried, but this was a failure. In 1674 Mason 
offered to surrender his rights to the Crown in return for one-third 
of the customs, rents, fines, and other profits derived therefrom, 
but although the offer was at first favourably considered it was 
finally declined. Mason then petitioned again, and this time 
Massachusetts was requested to send agents to England to 
answer his complaints. They arrived in December 1676,' and 
the case was tried before the Lords Chief Justices of the King's 
Bench and Common Pleas in April 1677. Mason presented no 
claim to the right of government, and as to the title to the lands 
claimed by him the court decided that this was a question 
between him and the several tenants to be determined by the 
local court having jurisdiction in such matters. Thereupon 
Mason, in January 1679, petitioned the king to appoint a 
governor who should have jurisdiction over all the lands which 
he claimed, and on the 18th of September of this year New 
Hampshire was constituted a separate province with a govern- 
ment vested in a president and council appointed by the king 
and an assembly chosen by the people. This was the principal 
outcome of Mason's persistent efforts to establish his rights to 
the land; for although he succeeded in procuring the appoint- 
ment of officers who supported his claims, and although decrees 
were issued in his favour, the tenants, who contended that they 
had profited nothing from what his grandfather had done or 
that they were on lands which Wheelwright had bought from 
the Indians, resisted the enforcement of those decrees. The 
contest, however, especially for the waste lands, was continued 
by Mason, his heirs and assigns until near the close of the 18th 
century. 

From 1686 to 1689 New Hampshire formed a part of the 
Dominion of New England, which, after the first few months, 
was under Sir Edmund Andros as governor-general. There 
being no provincial authority in New Hampshire at the close 
of this period, a convention of the leading citizens of its four 
towns attempted to establish one. Upon the failure of this 
attempt, a temporary nominal union with Massachusetts was 
formed, but in 1692 Samuel Allen, the assign of Mason, caused 
a royal government to be established with his son-in-law, John 
Usher, as lieutenant-governor, and during the remainder of the 
colonial era New Hampshire was separate from Massachusetts 
except that from 1699 to 1741 the two had the same governor. 
The boundary between the two provinces was yet to be deter- 
mined. Massachusetts proposed to confine New Hampshire to 
less than one-fourth its present area; that is, on the west to a 
line drawn 3 m. east of the south course of the Merrimac and on 
the north-east to a line drawn north-west from the source of the 
Salmon Falls river. New Hampshire claimed for its southern 
boundary a line drawn west from a point 3 m. north of the 
mouth of the Merrimac and for its upper eastern boundary a 
line running north by slightly west from the source of the 
Salmon Falls river. Both provinces granted townships within 
the disputed territory; Massachusetts arrested men there who 
refused to pay taxes to its officers, and sought to defer the settle- 
ment of the dispute. New Hampshire, being on the more 
friendly terms with the home government, finally petitioned the 
king to decide the matter, and in 1737 a royal order referred it 
to a commission to be composed of councillors from New York, 
Nova Scotia and Rhode Island. This body agreed upon the 
present eastern boundary but evaded deciding the southern one. 
Both parties then appealed to the king, and in 1741 the king in 
council confirmed the decision of the commission in regard to the 
eastern boundary and decided that the southern boundary 
should be a line corresponding to the course of the Merrimac 
from 3 m. north of its mouth to 3 m. north of Pawtucket Falls, 
at its most southerly bend, and thence due west to the next 
English province. This gave New Hampshire much more 
territory on the south than it had claimed. But the western 
boundary was not yet defined, and as early as 1749 a controversy 
over that arose with New York. New Hampshire asked for the 
territory west to within 20 m. of the Hudson river, or as far as 
the western boundaries of Massachusetts and Connecticut, while 
New York claimed east to the Connecticut river. Within a few 
years the governor of New Hampshire granted in the disputed 
territory 138 townships which were rapidly settled by those 
whom it was the duty of the province to protect. But there was 
a reluctance to incur the expense of a contest with so powerful 
a neighbour as New York, and in 1764 that province procured 
from the king in council a royal order declaring the western 
boundary of New Hampshire to be the western bank of the 
Connecticut river. The controversy, however, continued for 
some years thereafter (see Vermont). 

From 1676 to 1759 New Hampshire suffered greatly from 
the Indians, and the fear of them, together with the boundary 
disputes and Mason's claims, retarded settlement. But where 
these troubles were removed the population increased rapidly, 
and at the outbreak of the War of Independence the province 
had about 80,000 inhabitants, the great majority of whom 
were with the patriot or Whig party during that struggle. By 
June 1775 the once popular governor, Sir John Wentworth, was 
a refugee; on the 3th of January 1776 the fifth Provincial 
Congress established a provisional government; on the 15th 
of the following June the first Assembly elected under that 
government declared for independence; and on the 16th of 
August 1777 the important victory at Bennington was won by 
New Hampshire and Vermont troops under the command of 
General John Stark, who had a commission from New Hampshire. 
Six states had ratified the Federal constitution when the New 
Hampshire convention met at Exeter on the 13th of February 
1788, to accept or reject that instrument, and so great was the 
opposition to it among the delegates from the central part of 
the state that after a discussion of ten days the leaders in favour 
of ratification dared not risk a decisive vote, but procured an 
adjournment in order that certain delegates who had been 
instructed to vote against it might consult their constituents. 
Eight states had ratified when the convention reassembled at 
Concord on the 17th of June, and four days later, when a motion 
to ratify was carried by a vote of 57 to 47, adoption by the 
necessary nine states was assured. The War of Independence 
left the state heavily burdened with debt and many of its 
citizens threatened with a debtor's prison. As a means of 
relief a number of citizens demanded of the legislature the issue 
of paper money equal in amount to the state's debt, and as this 
was refused, an armed mob numbering about 200 surrounded the 
meeting-house in Exeter in which the legislature was in session, 
towards evening on the 20th of September 1786. But General 
John Sullivan (1 740-1795) was at that time president of the 
state, and on the next day he, with 2000 or more militia and 
volunteers, captured 39 of the leaders and suppressed the revolt 
without bloodshed. 

National elections in New Hampshire were carried by the 
Federalists until 18 16, except in 1804 when President Thomas 
Jefferson won by a small majority; but within this period of 
Federalist supremacy in national politics the Democrat-Repub- 
licans elected the governor from 1805 to 18 12 inclusive except 
in 1809. In 181 6 the Democrats won both state and national 
elections; and out of the transition from Federalist to Demo- 
cratic control, which was effected under the leadership of William 
Plumer (1750-1850), a prominent politician in New Hampshire 
for half a century, a United States senator from 1802 to 1807 
and governor of the state in 1812-1813 and 1816-1819, arose the 
famous Dartmouth College Case. As the trustees of this institu- 
tion were Federalists with the right to fill vacancies in their 
number, the Democrats attempted to gain control by converting 
it into a state university and increasing the number of trustees, 
but when the case reached the Supreme Court of the United 
States that body pronounced (1819) the charter a contract 
which the Federal constitution forbade the state to violate. 
Heretofore the Federalist r6gime had taxed the people to support 
the Congregational Church, but now the Baptists, Methodists 
and Universalists joined the Democrats, and in 1819 this state 
support was abolished by the " Toleration Act." Because of 
Daniel Webster's arguments in the Dartmouth College Case, 
and because his party had favoured the support of the Con- 
gregational Church by public taxation, he became very unpopular 
in this his native state. Accordingly, his denunciation of 
President Andrew Jackson's bank policy added strength to the 
Jacksonian Democracy, and, later, his Whig connexions were the 
greatest source of the Whig party's weakness in New Hampshire. 
John Quincy Adams was an intimate friend of William Plumer, 
the Democratic leader, and carried the state both in 1824 and 
1828, but a Jackson man was elected governor in 1827, 1829, 
1830 and 1 83 1. The Whigs never won a national or state 
election, and often their vote was only about one-half that of 
the Democrats. But the Democrats broke into two factions in 
1846 over the question of slavery (see Hale, John Parker); 
the American or " Know-Nothing " party elected a governor 
in 1855 and 1856; and then control of the state passed to the 
Republican party which has held it to the present. After 
1890 the railway corporations were charged with a corrupt 
domination of the legislature and the courts, and in 1906 a 
" Lincoln Republican " movement was organized under 
the leadership of the well-known novelist Winston Churchill 
(b. 1871), with the object of freeing the state from this 
influence.

NEW HARMONY, a village in Posey county, Indiana, U.S.A., 
on the Wabash river, about 22 m. N.W. of Evansville. Pop. 
(1900) 134 1 ; (19 10 ) 1229. It is served by the Illinois Central 
railway, and has regular steamboat connexion with the river 
cities. New Harmony had its beginning in 1814-1815, when 
it became the home of a communistic religious sect known 
variously as the Harmonists, Harmonites and Rappites, 
founded in Germany towards the end of the 18th century by 
George Rapp (1757-1847), a native of Iptingen in Wiirttemberg. 
Rapp and his followers, who sought to form a community after 
the manner of the primitive Christian Church, were persecuted 
in Germany, and in 1 803-1 804 emigrated to Butler county, 
Pennsylvania. There they established in 1805 a community 
known as Harmony, consisting of some 600 persons, who held 
their property in common and in 1807 adopted celibacy. In 1814 
Rapp sold most of his Pennsylvania land and bought about 
24,735 acres (in the next ten years more than 14,000 acres in 
addition) on the Wabash river in Indiana Territory. In 1814- 
181 5 Rapp and a thousand of his followers settled on the Indiana 
tract, their headquarters being established at New Harmony, 
or Harmonie as they called it. The settlers, mostly Germans, 
devoted themselves to agriculture, weaving and leather-working 
so industriously that they prospered from the start. Rapp, 
however, ( in 1825 disposed of his lands and property to Robert 
Owen, having returned with part of his followers to Pennsyl- 
vania and founded a new community known as Economy (q.v.) f 
in Beaver county, where he died in 1847. Intent on founding a 
socialistic community, Owen went to the United States in 1824, 
and purchased Rapp's lands and live stock for $182,000. He 
interested several well-known scientists in his settlement, and 
with them came to New Harmony in the spring of 1826. Within 
six months the community numbered over 1000. Among its 
most notable members were Robert Owen's sons, Robert Dale 
Owen (1 801-187 7), a political leader and diplomat; David Dale 
Owen (1807-1860) and Richard Owen (1810-1890), both geo- 
logists of note; William MaClure (1763-1840), the founder of the 
Academy of Natural Sciences at Philadelphia; Thomas Say 
(1 787-1 834), " the father of American Zoology " ; Charles Lesueur, 
a scientist and antiquarian; and Gerard Troost (1 776-1850), 
a well-known geologist. The greater part of the settlers, how- 
ever, were impractical theorists or adventurers. Constitution 
after constitution was adopted, and with the adoption of each 
new constitution and with each new religious discussion a group 
would secede and form a separate community — in 1828 there 
were ten — the best known and most successful being Macluria 
(like the others, occupying a part of Owen's land), named after 
William MaClure, who became its directing power. The whole 
organization broke up in 1827, and Owen left New Harmony 
in 1828. New Harmony has a Working Men's Institute 
Public Library t founded in 1838 by William MaClure, 
and having in 1907 18,000 volumes; the collection is rich in 
works dealing with socialism.

NEW HAVEN, the largest city of Connecticut, U.S.A., the 
county-seat of New Haven and the seat of Yale University. 
It is co-extensive with the township of New Haven (though there 
is both a township and a city government), and lies in the 
south-western part of the state, about 4 m. from Long Island 
Sound, at the head of New Haven Bay, into which empty three 
small streams, the Quinnipiac, the Mill and the West rivers. 
Pop. (1890) 81,298; (1900) 108,027, °f whom 30,802 were 
foreign-born, including 10,491 Irish, 5262 Italians, 4743 Germans, 
3193 Russians and 1376 Swedes; (1910 census) 133,605. 
Land area (1906) 17-91 sq. m., of which more than one-half was 
annexed since 1900. New Haven is served by the main line and 
five branches of the New York, New Haven & Hartford railway, 
by three inter-urban electric lines and by two steamship lines 
connecting with New York. The city is built on a level, sandy 
plain, in the rear of which is a line of hills terminating in two 
spurs, East Rock and West Rock, respectively 360 and 400 ft. 
high and 2 m. and 2 J m. distant from the Green. On East 
Rock is a monument to the Connecticut soldiers who fell in the 
War of Independence, the War of 1812, the Mexican War and 
the Civil War; on the West Rock is a cave, " Judges' Cave," 
in which the regicides William Goffe and Edward Whalley are 
said to have concealed themselves when sought for by royal 
officers in 1661. The central and older portion of the city is 
laid out in squares surrounding a public Green of 16 acres, which 
was in former days the centre of religious and social life. New 
Haven is popularly known as the " City of Elms," because of 
the number of these trees. Besides the Green there are 12 other 
parks, ranging from 6 to 300 acres in area, four of them being on 
the water front, along the harbour. On the west side of the 
city is Edgewood Park (120 acres); on the north is Beaver 
Pond Park (100 acres); and East and West Rocks, mentioned 
above, have been made into suburban parks. 

Among the public buildings and places of interest are the three 
churches on the Green, built in 1814; Center Church (Con- 
gregational), in the rear of which is the grave of John Dixwell 
( 1 608-1 689), one of the regicides; United (formerly known as 
North) Church (Congregational), and Trinity Church, which 
belongs to one of the oldest Protestant Episcopal congregations 
in Connecticut. On the north-western side of the Green are 
the buildings of Yale University (q.v.); the "college" campus 
is the square enclosed by College, Chapel, High and Elm streets, 
with Battell Chapel at its eastern corner, Farnam, Lawrence, 
Phelps, Welch and Osborn halls on its south-eastern side, 
Vanderbilt Hall, Connecticut (or South Middle) Hall, the oldest 
of the Yale buildings (1750), and the Art School on the southern 
side, the Library, Dwight Hall and Alumni Hall on the north- 
western and Durfee Hall on the northern side; farther north of 
the Green are the Divinity School, the University Campus, on 
which are the Bicentennial Buildings and Memorial Hall, and, 
lying between Grove Street and Trumbull Street and Prospect 
Street and Hillhouse Avenue, the buildings of the Sheffield 
Scientific School. In the vicinity is the Grove Street Cemetery, 
in which are the graves of many famous Americans. Besides the 
University Library, there are a Public Library (1887), containing 
about 80,000 vols., the library of the Young Men's Institute 
(1826) and the collection of the New Haven Colony Historical 
Society. The city contains a State Normal School and a number 
of hospitals and charitable institutions. 

Among the newspapers of New Haven are the Morning 
Journal and Courier (1832, Republican), whose weekly edition, 
the Connecticut Herald and Weekly Journal, was established as 
the New Haven Journal in 1766; the Palladium (Republican; 
daily, 1840; weekly, 1828); the Evening Register (Independent; 
daily, 1840; weekly, 1812); and the Union (1873), a Democratic 
evening paper. At New Haven also are published several 
weekly English, German and Italian papers, and a number of 
periodicals, including the American Journal of Science (18 18), 
the Yale Law Journal (1890) and the Yale Review (1892), a 
quarterly. 

In 1900 New Haven was the most important manufacturing 
centre in Connecticut, and in 1905 it was second only to 
Bridgeport in the value of its factory product. In 1905 its estab- 
lishments numbered 490. The principal manufactures are 
hardware, foundry and machine shop products, ammunition and 
fire-arms (the Winchester Company), carriages* and wagons, 
malt liquors, paper boxes and corsets. Meat packing is also 
an important industry. In 1905 the total capital invested in 
manufacturing was $31,412,715 and the total product $39,666,118 
(a gain of 13-7% since 1900). Commercially, New Haven is 
primarily a distributing point for the Atlantic seaboard, but 
the city is a port of entry, and foreign commerce (almost ex- 
clusively importing) is carried on to some extent, the imports in 
1909 being valued at $404,805. In 1908 the assessed valua- 
tion of real and personal property was $119,592,508, the net 
debt was $3,854,498 and the rate of taxation was 14*75 mi ^ s 
on the dollar. 

Under a charter of 1899, as amended afterwards, the city 
government, which has almost entirely superseded the town 
government, is in the hands of a mayor, who holds office for two 
years and appoints most of the administrative officers, except a 
board of aldermen (of whom each has a two-year term, six are 
chosen from the city at large and the others one each from each 
ward, the even-numbered wards electing their representatives 
one year and the odd-numbered the next), a city clerk, con- 
troller, sheriff, treasurer and tax collector, all chosen by 
popular vote, and an assistant clerk, appointed by the board of 
aldermen. 

The first settlement in New Haven (called Quinnipiac, its 
Indian name, until 1640) was made in the autumn of 1637 by a 
party of explorers in search of a site for colonization for a band 
of Puritans, led by Theophilus Eaton and the Rev. John Daven- 
port, who had arrived at Boston, Massachusetts, from England 
in July 1637. In the following spring a permanent settlement 
was made. It was governed under a " plantation covenant " 
until the 4th of June '1639, when, at a general meeting, the 
" free planters " adopted the fundamental principles of a new 
government. They agreed that the Scriptures should be their 
guide in civil affairs, and that only approved church members 
should be admitted to the body politic; twelve men were ap- 
pointed to choose seven men ("seven pillars") who should found 
the church and admit to its original membership such planters 
as they thought properly qualified. This having been done, the 
first General Court of which there is record met on the 25th of 
October. At this court the members of the new church, together 
with six members of other approved churches, were admitted 
to citizenship; a magistrate, four assistants, a secretary and a 
constable were chosen as the civil officers; annual elections and 
an annual session of the General Court in the last week of October 
were agreed upon; English statute and common law were 
expressly excluded; and the " worde of God was adopted as the 
onely rule to be attended unto in ordering the affayres of govern- 
ment in this plantation." As thus founded, New Haven was 
town and colony combined. In 1 643-1 644 the colony was ex- 
panded into the New Haven Jurisdiction, embracing the towns 
of New Haven, Guilford, Milford, Stamford and Branford in 
Connecticut, and, on Long Island, Southold; but this "Juris- 
diction " was dissolved in 1664, and all these towns (except 
Southold) passed under the jurisdiction of Connecticut, according 
to the Connecticut charter of 1662. The government of the 
Jurisdiction was of the strictest Puritan type, and although the 
forty-five " blue laws " which the Rev. Samuel Peters, in his 
General History of Connecticut, ascribed to New Haven were 
much confused with the laws of the other New England colonies 
and some were mere inventions, yet many of them, and others 
equally " blue," were actually in operation as enactments or 
as court decisions in New Haven. 

Among those in the Peters's list which are wholly or substantially 
true are the following: " The judges shall determine controversies 
without a jury"; "Married persons must live together or be 
imprisoned ; "A wife shall be good evidence against her hus- 
band"; "No minister shall keep school"; "The selectmen, on 
finding children ignorant, may take them away from their parents 
and put them into better hands, at the expense of their parents." 
Among those in the same list which are wholly or in part spurious 
are: " No woman shall kiss her child on the Sabbath or fasting day," 
and " No one shall travel, cook victuals, make beds, sweep house, cut 
hair or shave on the Sabbath day." 

One of the most important events in the history of New Haven 
was the removal hither in October 1716 from Saybrook of the 
Collegiate School of Connecticut, which developed into Yale 
University. The period of greatest material prosperity of New 
Haven in the colonial period began about 1750, when a thriving 
commerce with other American ports and the West Indies 
developed. As a port it was notorious for its smuggling and 
illicit trade. New Haven also had extensive shipbuilding 
interests. All attempts to enforce the British commercial regula- 
tions were ineffectual. On the 22nd of February 1763 a town 
meeting resolved to encourage colonial manufactures and to 
refrain from importing from England hats, clothing, leather, 
gold and silver lace, huttons, cheese, liquors, &c. Two years 
later Jared Ingersoll (1722-1781), who had been sent to England 
to protest against the Stamp Act, but had accepted'the office of 
Stamp Distributor on the advice of Benjamin Franklin, was 
forced to resign his office. In 1770 most of the merchants agreed 
not to import goods from England and transferred "their 
trade with New York City, where Loyalist influence was strong, 
to Boston and Philadelphia. When news of the embargo of 
the port at Boston arrived at New Haven, a Committee of 
Correspondence was at once formed; and in the War of Inde- 
pendence the people enthusiastically supported the American 
cause. On the 5th of July 1779 the place was invaded by a 
British force under General William Tryon, who intended to burn 
the town, but met so strong a resistance that he withdrew before 
the next day. New Haven's commerce suffered severely during 
the war, but by the close of the first decade of the 19th century 
it had regained its former importance. When the War of 1812 
opened there were fully 600 seamen in the city, practically all 
of whom were engaged in privateering or in the regular naval 
service of the United States. Among them was Captain Isaac 
Hull. In 1815 the Fulton, the first steamboat on Long Island 
Sound, made its first trip from New York to New Haven. The 
second quarter of the 19th century was the period of develop- 
ment of railways and manufactures. The period since the Civil 
War has been marked by a diversification of industries. To that 
conflict New Haven contributed approximately $30,000,000, 
and 3000 men, 500 of whom were killed. From 1701 until 1873 
New Haven was the joint capital (with Hartford) of Connecticut. 
New Haven was incorporated as a city in 1784; new charters 
were secured from the General Assembly of the state in 1869, 
1881 and 1899. Fair Haven was annexed to New Haven in 1897.

NEWHAVEN, a seaport in the Eastbourne parliamentary 
division of Sussex, England, 56 m. S. from London by the London, 
Brighton & South Coast railway, on the English Channel at the 
mouth of the Ouse. Pop. of urban district (1901) 6772. The 
church of St Michael has a Norman square embattled tower 
surmounted by a spire, and an apsidal chancel. The port is 
protected by fortifications. A harbour was first granted to 
Newhaven in 1713, and during the early part of the 18th century 
it possessed a large shipping trade. This afterwards declined, 
but it is now one of the principal points of communication 
between England and France, the railway company maintaining 
a daily service of fast steamers to Dieppe in connexion with the 
Chemin de fer de TOuest. The tidal harbour, which is owned 
by a company, is enclosed by two piers and a breakwater, the 
area being about 30 acres, and the quayage 1400 yds. The* 
roadstead is one of the finest on the coast of England. With 
France there is a large traffic in wines, spirits, silk, fruit, veget- 
ables and general provisions. The coasting trade consists 
chiefly of imports of coal and provisions, the exports being 
principally timber for shipbuilding and flint for the Staffordshire 
potteries. Some shipbuilding is carried on. 


NEW HEBRIDES, a chain of islands in the western Pacific 
Ocean, between 166 and 171 E., and 13 and 21 S., included 
in Melanesia, and under the joint influence of Great Britain and 
France. (For map, see Pacific Ocean.) From New Caledonia 
to the S.W. they are separated by a deep channel; but a com- 
paratively shallow sea indicates their physical connexion with 
the Santa Cruz group (q.v.) to the N. The chain lies S.E. and 
N.W., but the main islands are arranged somewhat in the form 
of the letter Y. The south-easternmost island is Aneiteum; 
N.W. from this the main islands are Tanna or Aipere, Eromanga, 
Efate, 1 the Shepherd Islands and Api or Epi. At this point the 
arms of the Y divide, the western comprising the large islands of 
Malekula or Mallicollo and Espiritu Santo, 2 the eastern consisting 
of Ambrym, Arag and Maiwo or Aurora, with Aoba or Leper 
Island between the two arms. Espiritu Santo, the largest 
island, has an area of 875 sq. m. Irregularly disposed to the N. 
of the Y are the lesser islands composing the Banks group — 
Gaua, Vanua Lava, Mota, Valua, &c, and the Torres Islands. 

With their rugged outline and rich vegetation, the islands as 
seen from the sea are very beautiful. Excepting the small Torres 
group, which are low-lying and perched on reefs, but without 
lagoons, all the islands are of volcanic, not coral, formation, the 
larger ones lying on both sides of the line of volcanic activity. 
The coasts are almost free from reefs and the shores rise abruptly 
from deep water. Old coral is sometimes found elevated to a 
considerable height. The islands are formed chiefly of basalt 
and recent eruptive material; earthquakes and submarine 
eruptions are not infrequent ; and some of the islands themselves 
have active craters. All have considerable elevations, the 
loftiest being the isolated cone of Lopevi, near the junction of the 
arms of the Y; its height is 4714 ft. The volcanic soil is very 
rich. Numerous clear streams water the islands, but some 
debouch upon flat ground towards the sea, and form unhealthy 
marshes there. Copper, iron and nickel are the most important 
minerals known in the group, and sulphur is of some commercial 
importance. 

The climate is generally hot and damp, but there is a season 
(November to April) which is specially distinguished, as such, 
and is somewhat unhealthy. The trees — Casuarina, candle nut 
(Aleurites triloba), kauri pine (or Tanna), various species of 
Ficus, Myrtaceae and many others — are magnificent; the 
coco-nut is not confined to the coast, but grows high up the 
valleys on the hill-sides. Sandal- wood is also found. Besides 
the hreadfruit, sago-palm, banana, sugar, yam, taro, arrowroot 
and several forest fruits, the orange, pine-apple and other 
imported species flourish; and European vegetables are exported 
to Sydney. Land mammals are scarce; they include bats, rats 
and pigs which have run wild. There are some lizards and 
turtles; birds include pigeons, parrots, ducks and swallows; 
locusts, grasshoppers, butterflies and hornets are numerous, 
and the sea abounds in fish, which, however, are generally inferior 
as food, and in some cases poisonous. 

The native population is estimated at 50,000; in 1904 the 
British population was 212, the French 401. The island of 
Efat6 contains the seat of the joint government, Vila or Port 
Vila (formerly Franceville), and the majority of the French 
population. There are several British and French trading 
companies, and a considerable area is cleared and worked by 
settlers. The chief exports are copra, coffee, maize, bananas, 
timber, &c. 

	1 Efate\ Vate\ Fate\ Efat or Sandwich island. 
	8 Abbreviated to Santo ; native Marina. 

The natives of the New Hebrides are Melanesians of mixed blood, 
and vary much in different islands. On Efate* and some others 
Polynesian immigration has produced a taller, fairer and less 
savage people. In some parts, as on Aoba, isolated Polynesian 
communities exist. But the general type is Mclanesian: black 
skin, woolly hair, low, receding forehead, broad face, flat nose and 
thick lips. The natives decorate themselves with nose-rings and 
ear-rings and bracelets of shells. The men are constantly fighting; 
their weapons are bows and poisoned arrows, often beautifully 
designed, clubs of elaborate patterns and spears. Their houses are 
either round huts, or rectangular with pitched roofs resting on 
three parallel rows of posts. The villages are scrupulously clean 
and neat, ornamented with flowering shrubs, crotons and dracacnas, 
and are often fortified with stone walls. In character the New 
Hebrideans are ferocious and treacherous, though most of their 
unhospitality and savagery is to-be traced to the misconduct and 
cruelty of traders and labour agents. The women occupy a de- 
graded position, and in some islands widows are buried alive with 
the bodies of their husbands. There is a great belief in sorceries 
and omens; but prayer and offerings (usually of shell money) are 
addressed mainly to the spirits of the (recently) dead, and there is 
another class of spirits, called Vui, who arc appealed to when incor- 
porate in certain stones or animals; of one of two such the divinity 
is recognized generally. By the villages a space shadowed by a 

reat banyan tree is often set apart for dances and public meetings, 
certain sanctity attaches also sometimes to the Casuarina and the 
Cycas. An important institution is the club-house, in which there 
arc various grades, whereon a man's rank and influence mainly 
depend, his grade being recognized even if he goes to another island 
where his language is unintelligible. In like manner a division into 
two great exogamous groups prevails, at all events throughout the 
northern islands. It would therefore seem that the present diversity 
of languages in the group must be of relatively recent origin. These 
languages or dialects are numerous, and mutually unintelligible, 
but alike as to grammatical construction, and belonging to the 
Melanesian class. 

History. — The Portuguese Pedro Fernandez de Quiros, sighting 
Espiritu Santo in 1606, thought he had discovered the great 
southern continent then believed to exist, and named it Australia 
del Espiritu Santo. Louis de Bougainville visited the islands 
in 1768, and Captain Cook, who gave them the name they bear, 
in 1774. The subsequent visits of several explorers, the ex- 
ploitation of the sandal-wood and other products by traders 
and the arrival of missionaries helped to open up the islands and 
to give them a certain commercial importance by the middle of 
the 19th century. Trade was mainly with New Caledonia, and 
France was thus indicated as the dominant power in the New 
Hebrides; even British planters pressed France to annex the 
islands in 1876, but- in the following year some of the missionaries 
urged the same course on England. In 1878 the islands were 
declared neutral by Great Britain and France. The presence of 
British and French settlers under independent authority led to 
unsatisfactory administration, especially in regard to the settle- 
ment of civil actions and jurisdiction over the native population. 
As to the establishment of commercial supremacy, French 
interests clashed with Australian, and in 1882 M. John Higginson 
of New Caledonia (d. 1904) consolidated the former by founding 
the trading society which afterwards became the SocUtt franqaise 
des Nouvelles-He'brides. In 1886 one of the most serious of 
many native outbreaks occurred, necessitating a French de- 
monstration of force from New Caledonia. An Anglo-French 
convention of the 16th of November 1887 provided for the 
surveillance of the islands (protection of life and property) by a 
mixed commission of naval officers. The Anglo-French agreement 
of 1904 had a clause providing for an arrangement as to proper 
jurisdiction over the natives and for the appointment of a com- 
mission to settle disputes between British and French landed 
proprietors. In this and the following year there was much 
unrest among the natives, and a joint punitive expedition was 
necessary. 

Strong feeling was aroused meanwhile in Australia owing to 
the disabilities suffered by British settlers in the islands. British 
annexation, or at least a division of the group into British and 
French spheres, was urged. But on the 20th of October 1906 
a convention was signed in London, confirming a protocol of 
the preceding' 27th of February, and providing that " the group 
of the New Hebrides, including the Banks and Torres Islands," 
should form " a region of joint influence," in which British and 
French subjects should have equal rights in all respects, and 
each power should retain jurisdiction over its own subjects or 
citizens. The claim of other powers to share the joint influence 
was excluded by the provision that their subjects resident on the 
islands must be under either British or French jurisdiction. A 
British and a French high commissioner were appointed, each 
assisted by a resident commissioner; provision was made for 
two police forces of equal strength, and the joint naval com- 
mission of 1887 was retained for the purpose of keeping order. 
The high commissioners were given authority over the native 
chiefs. A joint court was established, consisting of two judges, 
appointed respectively by Great Britain and France, and a 
third, to be president, and not a British subject or French 
citizen, appointed by the king of Spain. Its jurisdiction covers 
civil cases (including commercial suits and those respecting 
landed property), native offences or crimes against non-natives, 
and all offences against the provisions of the convention. The 
sale of arms and intoxicants to natives is forbidden; and the 
convention regulates the recruitment of native labour. Pro- 
vision was made for community of interests in regard to public 
works, finance and the official use of the English and French 
languages. The creation of municipalities on the application 
of groups of not less than thirty non-native residents was pro- 
vided for, municipal votes being given to both sexes. The con- 
vention provided against the establishment of a penal settlement 
and the erection of fortifications. 

This convention was bitterly criticized in Australia on the 
ground that many of the provisions which nominally established 
equality between British and French would operate in practice 
to the advantage of the French; and there was no little dis- 
satisfaction on the ground that the Australian government was 
neither represented at the preliminary conference, nor fully 
consulted during the negotiations.

NEW IBERIA, a city of Louisiana, U.S.A., capital of Iberia 
parish, on the Bayou Teche, in the southern part of the state, 
about 125 m. W. of New Orleans. Pop. (1890) 3447; (1900) 
6815 (3309 negroes); (1910) 7499. It is served by the Southern 
Pacific, the Franklin and Abbeville, and the New Iberia & 
Northern railways. Lumber, sugar, cotton and rice' are pro- 
duced in the neighbourhood. At the village of Avery Island, 
about 10 m. S.E., there are deposits of rock salt. The 
municipality owns and operates the waterworks and the 
electric lighting plant. New Iberia was laid out in 1835 and 
was chartered as a city in 1839. 


NEW JERSEY, one of the Middle Atlantic states of the 
American Union, lying between 41^ 21' 22-6* and 38 55' 40' 
N. lat., and 75 35' and 73 53' 39* W. long. It is bounded, N., 
by the state of New York; E., by the Hudson river, which 
separates the state from New York, and by the Atlantic Ocean; 
and S. and W. by the Delaware Bay and river, which separate 
New Jersey from Delaware and Pennsylvania. All the boundaries 
except the northern are natural. New Jersey has an extreme 
length, N. and S., of 166 m., an extreme width, E. and W., of 
57 m., and a total area of 8224 sq. m., of which 710 sq. m. are 
water-surface. 

Physiography. — There are within the state four distinct topo- 
graphic belts — the Appalachian, the Highlands, the Triassic Low- 
land and the Coastal Plain. The folded Appalachian belt crosses 
the N.W. corner of the state, and includes the Kittatinny Mountain 
and Valley. The mountain has a north-east-south-west trend, 
crossing the Delaware river at the Delaware Water Gap and con- 
tinuing S.W. into Pennsylvania. In width the range varies from 
4 or 5 m. in the N. to about 2 m. in the S. Jts western foot lies 
along the Delaware river, which for some distance flows parallel 
with the range, and has an altitude of about 400 ft. above the sea 
at Port jervis, where it enters the state, and of about 300 ft. at the 
Water Gap, where it leaves it. Where the crest of the ridge enters 
the state its elevation is 1539 ft.; at High Point, 1} m. S.W. the 
ridge attains a height of 1803 ft., the highest point within the state, 
A short distance S.W. of this point, in a depression in the mountain 
crest, is Lake Marcia, at an elevation of 1570 ft. Beyond Culver's 
Gap the mountain again narrows to a ridge, and for a portion of its 
length it is double-crested. On the eastern side the slope is so 
abrupt as to make ascent difficult and at places impossible, but the 
western slope, on* account of a dip of the rock to the N.W., is more 
gradual. The eastern foot has a very uniform altitude of from 
900 to 1000 ft. above the sea. The crest of the ridge is from 600 
to 1200 ft. W. of the foot, and from 450 to 600 ft. above it. At 
the Water Gap the ridge is cut through to its base, and the Delaware 
river flows through the opening. This gap, 900 ft. wide at the 
base and 4500 ft. wide at the top, with sides rising very abruptly 
to a height of 1200 ft. and more, is an impressive sight. The 
Kittatinny Valley, S.E. of and parallel to the Kittatinny Range, is 
about 40 m. long and 12 m. wide and has an average elevation of 
700 ft. Its western margin is from 900 to 1000 ft. above the sea, 
and its eastern border is from 400 to 500 ft. lower. The floor of the 
valley is very undulating, and contains numerous small streams, 
whose divides are from 700 to 900 ft. above the sea. South-east of 
the Kittatinny Valley, and parallel with it, lies the second topo- 
graphic belt, the Highlands. This region embraces an area of 
900 sq. m., having a length, N.E. and S.W., of 60 m., and a width 
varying from 9 to 18 m. It consists of an upland plateau now 
dissected by streams into a series of hills and ridges, and corresponds 
to the Piedmont Belt farther to the S.W. and to the upland region 
of southern New England. The average elevation of the Highlands 
is about 1000 ft.; the highest point, between Canisteer and Vernon, 
in Sussex county, being 1496 ft. The third belt, called the Triassic 
Lowland, occupies about one-fifth of the surface of the state. Its 
N.W. border is marked by a line drawn S.W. across the state through 
Pompton, Morristown, Lebanon and Highbridge to the Delaware; 
its S.E. border by a line drawn from Woodbridge to Trenton. The 
surface is irregular, with altitudes ranging from about sea-level to 
900 ft. A noteworthy feature of this area is the series of trap rock 
ridges, between which the Passaic river makes its irregular way 
through a region of flat bottom lands. On the N. E. border of the 
Lowland, one of these trap ridges lines the western bank of the 
Hudson river for about 25 m., and is known as the Palisade Ridge, 
or simply the Palisades, because of the scenic effect produced by 
the columnar jointing and steep eastern wall of the trap sheet. 
To the W. the slope of the ridge is very gentle. The Palisades extend 
from a point N. of the New York boundary as far S. as Weehawkcn, 
their height gradually decreasing southward. A slope of debris 
occurs at the E. base of the Palisade Ridge, but the summit is 
covered with trees. The trap formation extends to the Kill van Kull 
Channel, and includes, among other ridges, the so-called First and 
Second Watchung (or Orange) Mountains W. of the group of suburbs 
known as the "Oranges/' but S. of Weehawken it has no scenic 
attractiveness. With the exception of the ridges, the Triassic Low- 
land N. of the Raritan river is usually below 200 ft. in altitude; 
S. of the Raritan the topography of this belt is similar to the northern 
portion, but much of the area is over 200 ft. above the sea. South- 
east of the Triassic Lowland lies the fourth topographic belt, the 
Coastal Plain, containing an area of 4400 sq. m., or slightly more 
than one-half the entire surface of the state. This belt, bordered 
on the^E., S. and W. by water, is highest near its centre and lowest 
along its margins. It is free from mountainous ridges, but there 
are a number of isolated hills, such as the Navesink Highlands 
(259 ft.) in Monmouth county. One-third of the Coastal Plain is 
below 50 ft. in altitude; two-fifths are between 50 and 100 ft.; 
and somewhat more than a fourth of the area Is over 100 ft. above 
sea-level. The total area of the belt as high as 200 ft. above the sea 
does not exceed 15 sq. m. About one-eighth of the area consists 
of tidal marsh, lying chiefly between the long sandy ridges or barrier 
beaches of the Atlantic coast and the mainland. The width of the 
marsh varies from 1 to 6 m., being least in the extreme N. and S. 
and greatest near the mouths of streams. There is also a marsh 
along Delaware Bay, unprotected by a beach. The waters between 
these beaches and the mainland are gradually filling with sediment 
and changing into tidal marsh. In addition to the stretches of marsh 
alpng the coast, the eastward-flowing rivers of the Coastal Plain are 
fringed with large areas of swamp land, some of which is well 
forested. 

For the entire state the average elevation is 250 ft., with 4100 
sq. m. below 100 ft.; 2100 sq. m. between 100 and 500 ft. ; 1400 
sq. m. between 500 and 1000 ft.; and 215 sq. m. between 1000 and 
1500 ft. The' four topographic belts of the state correspond very 
closely to the outcrops of its geological formations; the rocks of the 
Appalachian belt being of Palaeozoic age; the formation of the 
Highlands, Archaean; that of the Triassic Lowland, Triassic ; that 
of the irregular hills of the Coastal Plain, Cretaceous and Tertiary. 

The great terminal moraine of the glacial epoch crosses the N.E.- 
S.W. topographic belts of the state, in an irregular line running W. 
u a ' f / 0m State . n Island, N.Y. North of the morainic belt 
the effect of the glaciation is seen in the irregular courses of the 
streams, the numerous lakes and freshwater marshes and the falls 
and rapids along those streams displaced by the glaciers from their 
former courses. The effect of glaciation on the soil is noted in a 
later paragraph. 

The Delaware river, from its junction with the Neversink Creek 
to the capes, flows along the western and southern borders of the 
state for a distance of 245 m., and has a total drainage area in 
New Jersey of 2345 sq. m. Of equal importance is the Hudson, 
whose lower waters, forming the north-eastern boundary of New 
Jersey for a distance of 22 m., drain a very small part of the state, 
but have contributed materially to the state's commercial develop^ 
ment. The streams lying wholly within the state are relatively 
unimportant. Of the tributaries to the Delaware river the northern- 
most is Flat Brook, 25 m. long, draining an area of 65 sq. m. W. of 
the Kittatinny Mountain. The Kittatinny Valley is drained by 
Paulins Kill and the Pequest river in the E. and S.E., and by the 
Walkill river in the N.E. Of the streams of the Highlands and the 
Triassic Lowland, the Passaic river is the most important. Rising 
in the N.E. — in the southern part of Morris county — it pursues a 
winding north-easterly course, passing through a gap in the trap 
rock at Little Falls, and by means of a cascade and a mile of rapids 
descends 40 ft. At Paterson, 3 m. farther, the stream passes through 
a crevasse in the trap rock and has a sheer fall of 70 ft. (the Great 
Falls of the Passaic). 1 The stream then makes a sharp bend south- 
ward and empties into Newark Bay. 2 The Passaic and its small 
tributaries — the Whippany, Rockaway, Pequanac, Wanaque, 
Saddle and Ramapo — drain an area of about 950 sq. m. On account 
of the rapid fall of its tributaries, the union of so many of them with 
the main stream near its middle course and the obstructions to the 
flow of the water in the lower course, the Passaic is subject to 
disastrous floods. In 1903 a heavy rainfall caused a flood which 
continued from the 8th to the 19th of October and destroyed not 
less than $7,000,000 worth of property. Another, which continued 
from the 25th of February to the 9th of March 1902, destroyed 
property valued at $1,000,000 or more, and there were less dis- 
astrous floods in 1882 and 1896. 8 The Hackensack river enters the 
state about 5 m. W. of the Hudson river, flows almost parallel 
with that stream, and empties into Newark Bay, having a length 
of 34. m. and a drainage area of 201 sq. m. The Raritan river, 
flowing eastwardly through the centre of the state, is the largest 
stream lyjng wholly within New Jersey, and drains 1105 sq. m. 
Commercially, however, this stream is less important than the 
Passaic. In the southern half of the state the drainage is simple, 
and the streams are unimportant, flowing straight to the Delaware 
or the Atlantic. The westward streams are only small creeks; 
the eastward and southward streams, however, on account of the 
wider slope, have greater length. Among the latter are the Maurice 
river, 33 m. long, emptying into Delaware Bay; and the Great Egg 
Harbor river, 38 m. long, and the Mullica, 32 m. long, emptying into 
the Atlantic. In the northern part of the state, and especially 
among the Highlands, are numerous lakes, which are popular places 
of resort during the summer months. Of these the largest and the 
most frequented are Lake Hopatcong, an irregular body of water in 
Morris and Sussex counties, and Greenwood Lake, lying partly in 
New York and partly in New Jersey. 

Fauna and Flora. — The fauna of New Jersey does not differ 
materially from that of the other Middle Atlantic states. Large 
game has almost disappeared. The red, or Virginia, deer and the 
grey fox are still found in circumscribed localities; and of the 
smaller mammals, the squirrel, chipmunk, rabbit, raccoon and 
opossum are still numerous. Amonj* game birds are various species 
of ducks, the quail, or " Bob White," and the woodcock. The 
waters of the coast and bays abound in shad, menhaden, bluefish, 
weak-fish (squeteague), clams and oysters. The interior streams are 
stocked with trout, black bass and perch. 

The conditions of plant growth are varied. In the northern and 
north central parts of the state, where the soil consists partly of 
glacial drift, the species have a wider range than is the case farther 
S., where the soil is more uniform. New Jersey is a meeting ground 
for many species which have their principal habitat farther N. or 
farther S., and its flora therefore may be divided into a northern 
and a. southern. Still another class, and the most clearly marked of 
all, is the flora of the beaches, salt marshes and meadows. The 
total woodland area of the state is about 3234 sq. m. Two distinct 
types of forest are recognized, with the usual transition zone between 
them. South and east of a line drawn approximately from Seabright 
to Glassboro, and thence southward to Delaware Bay, is a nearly 
level, sandy region known as tf The Pines." This is the great forest 
area of the state; it contains about 1,200,000 acres of woodland, 
practically continuous, and portions of it still but sparsely inhabited. 
The original forest has been entirely removed, but a young growth 
of the same tree species, chiefly pitch pine with a variety of oaks, 
replaces it. Within " The Pines, immediately north of the Mullica 
river, lies an area of about 20,000 acres called " The Plains." These 
are sparsely clothed with prostrate pitch pine, scrub oak and laurel. 
Tree forms are entirely absent. The cause of this condition is still 
undetermined. Along the streams in this section are many swamps, 
valuable for the white cedar that they produce, or when cleared, for 
cranberry bogs. The northern part of the state is much more rugged, 

	1 As the waters of the stream have been diverted into mill races, 
	the river very seldom makes this leap in its natural channel. The 
	power thus generated has been largely instrumental in creating the 
	city of Paterson (q.v.). 

	2 The total length of the Passaic is about 100 m., but its course is 
	so irregular that the distance in a straight line from its source to 
	its mouth is only about 15 m.

and the forests are chiefly of chestnut and various species of oak. 
Though much broken by farms and other elements of culture they 
aggregate about 740,000 acres. New Jersey's forests have suffered 
much from fire, but with the exception of " The Plains" the soil 
everywhere is well adapted to tree growth. A comparatively mild 
climate and good market facilities increase the potential value of 
the whole woodland area. -The state maintains a Forest Com- 
mission whose chief concern is to control the fires and thereby give 
value to private holdings. ^ In this effort it is meeting with consider- 
able success. The state is also acquiring, and maintaining as de- 
monstration acres and public parks, forest reserves in various parts 
of the state, The^ five reserves now held are in Atlantic, Burlington 
and Sussex counties and aggregate 9899 acres. 1 

Climate, — Between the extreme northern and southern sections 
of the state there is a greater variation in climate than would natur- 
ally result from their difference in latitude. This is due to the prox- 
imity of the ocean in the S. and to the relatively high altitudes in 
the N\ Near Cape May fruit trees bloom two or three weeks earlier 
than in the Highlands. The mean annual temperature ranges 
from 49-2° F. at Dover, in the N., to 55*4° at Bridgeton, in the S. 
The average date of the first killing frost at Dover is the 4th of 
October, and of the last, the 10th of May; at Atlantic City, on the 
sea-coast, these dates are respectively the 4th of November and the 
nth of April. At Dover the mean annual temperature is 49 ; 
the mean for the winter is 28 , with an extreme minimum recorded 
of -13 ; and the mean for the summer is 70 , with an extreme 
maximum recorded of 102 . At Atlantic City the mean annual 
temperature is 52 °; for the winter it is 34 , with an extreme of -7 ; 
and for the summer, 70 , with an extreme of 99 °. At Vineland, a 
southern interior town, the mean annual temperature is 53 ; for 
the winter it is 33 , with an extreme of -13 ; and for the summer, 
74 , with an extreme of 105 . These records of temperature afford 
a striking illustration of the moderating influence of the ocean upon 
the extremes of summer and winter. On account of the proximity 
to the sea, New Jersey has a more equable climate than have some 
of the states in the same latitude farther west. During the summer 
months the general course of the wind along the sea-coast is in- 
terrupted about midday by an incoming current of air, the" sea 
breeze," which gradually increases until about three o'clock in the 
afternoon, and then gradually lessens until the offshore wind takes 
its place. As the heat is thus made less oppressive along the coast > 
the beaches of New Jersey have rapidly built up with towns and 
cities that have become popular summer resorts — among the best 
known of these are Long Branch, Asbury Park, Ocean Grove, 
v Atlantic City (also a winter resort) and Cape May. Among the 
interior resorts are Lakcwood, a fashionable winter resort, and Lake 
Hopatcong, and Greenwood Lake and surrounding regions, much 
frequented in the summer. In the summer the prevailing winds 
throughout the state are from the S.W.; in the winter, from the 
N.W. The normal annual precipitation is 47*7 in., varying from 
46-6 in. on the sea-coast to 49-1 in. in the Highlands and the^Kitta- 
tinny Valley. ^ Precipitation is from 1 to 3 in. greater in the 
summer than in the other seasons, which diner among themselves 
very little in the* average amount of rainfall. From December to 
March, inclusively, part of the precipitation is in the form of snow. 
In the extreme S. there is more rain than snow in the winter; but 
no part of the state is free from snow storms. In the summer 
thunder storms are frequent, but are generally local in extent, and 
are much more common in the afternoon and early evening than in 
the morning. 

Soils. — The soils of the state exhibit great variety. Those of the 
northern and central sections are made up in part of glacial drift; 
those of the S. are sandy or loamy, and are locally enriched by 
deposits of marl. The most fertile soils of the state lie in the clay 
and marl region, a belt from 10 to 20 m.wide extending across the 
state in a general south-westerly direction from Long Branch to 
Salem. South of this belt the soils are generally sandy and are not 
very fertile except at altitudes of less than 50' ft., where they are 
loamy and of alluvial origin. 

Agriculture. — In 1900 very little more land was under cultivation 
than in 1850, the total acreage for these years being respectively 
2,840,966 and 2,752,946. The number of farms, however, increased 
from 23,905 to 34,294, and the average size of the farms decreased 
from 115-2 acres to 82 acres, an indication that agriculture gradually 
became more intensive. In 1900, 22% of the farms contained 
from 20 to 50 acres, 48-3%, 50-175 acres and only 7*8% con- 
tained over 175 acres. Farms were smallest in Hudson county, 
where, the average size was 7*9 acres, and largest in Sussex county, 
where the average size was 143*4 acres. The counties with the 
largest total acreage were Burlington (343,096), Sussex (256,896) 
and Hunterdon (248,733). Between 1880 and 1900 the percentage 
of farms operated by owners decreased from 75*4 to 70*1 ; the per- 

	1 The amount of timber cut within the state is very small. Before 
	the introduction of coal and coke as fuel in the forges and furnaces 
	the cutting of young trees for the manufacture of charcoal was a 
	profitable industry, and the process of deforestation reached its 
	maximum. Since i860 the forest areahas only slightly diminished, 
	and the condition of the timber has improved, but large trees are 
	still scarce. 

centage of cash tenants increased from 10-5 to 15*3; and that of 
share tenants remained about stationary, being 14*1 in 1880 and 
14-6 in 1900. In this last year 27-5 % of the farms derived their 
principal income from live stock, 20-3 % from vegetables, 17-2 % 
from dairy produce, 7-8 % from fruits and 7-8 % from hay and 
grain. 

In 1907, according to the Year Book of the United States Depart- 
ment of Agriculture, the principal crops were: hay, 634,000 
tons ($10,778,000); potatoes, 8,400,000 bushels (#6,216,000); 
Indian corn, 8,757,000 bushels ($5,517,000); wheat, 1,998,000 
bushels ($1,958,000); rye, 1,372,000 bushels ($1,04.3,000); oats, 
1,770,000 bushels ($991,000). The number and value of each of 
the various classes of live stock in the state on the 1st of January 
1908 were as follows: horses, 102,000 ($11,526,000); mules, 5000 
($675,000); inilch cows, 190,000 ($8,170,000); other neat cattle, 
82,000 ($1,722,000); sheep, 44,000 ($220,000); swine, 155,000 
($i»555,ooo) ; In 1809, 5959 farms were classified as t dairy farms, 
i.e. they derived at least 40 % of their income from dairy products ; 
and the total value of dairy products was $8,436,869, the larger 
items being $6,318,568 for milk sold and $818,624 for butter sold. 
Poultry raising also is an important agricultural industry: poultry 
in the state was valued at $1,300,853 on the 1st of June 1900; and 
for the year 1899 the value of all poultry raised was $2,265,816, 
and the value of eggs was $1,938,304. In the production of cereals 
the state has not taken high rank since the development of the wheat 
fields of the western states; but in 1890 the acreage in cereals was 
45*4 % of the acreage in all crops, and the value of the yield was 
2 5"3% of that of all crops. Of the total acreage in cereals in 1907, 
278,000 acres were in Indian corn; 108,000 in wheat; 78,000 in 
rye; and 60,000 in oats. The chief cereal-producing counties in 
1899 were Burlington, Hunterdon, Monmouth and Salem. The most 
valuable field crop in 1907 was hay and forage, consisting mostly of 
clover and cultivated grasses; in 1899 tne value of this crop was 
20-2 % of that of all crops. 

Since 1830 market gardening in New Jersey has become in- 
creasingly important, especially in the vicinity of large cities, and 
has proved more profitablethan the growing of cereals. In the total 
acreage devoted to the raising of vegetables in marketable quantities 
New Jersey in 1900 was surpassed fciy only two other states. The 
value of the marketable vegetables in 1899 was $4,630,658, and the 
value of the total vegetable crop, $8,425,596, or 30- ^ % of that of all 
crops. Among the vegetables grown the potato is the most im- 
portant; in 1907 there were 70,000 acres in potatoes, yielding 
8,400,000 bushels, valued at $6,216,000. Between 1899 and 1907 
the value of the potato crop more than doubled. In 1899 the state 
also produced 5,304,503 bushels of tomatoes; 2,418,641 bushels of 
sweet potatoes; 2,052,200 bunches of asparagus; 17,890,980 heads 
of cabbage; 21,495,940" musk melons ;^ 3,300,330 water melons; 
and 1 ,015,1 1 1^ bushels of sweet corn. Fruit-growing has also attained 
considerable importance. In 1899 the total value of the crop was 
$4,082,788; the value of the orchard fruit was $2,594,981; of small 
fruits, $1,406,049; and of grapes, $81,758. Peaches grow in all 
parts of the state, but most of the crop comes from Hunterdon, 
Sussex and Somerset counties. Apples are grown there and also 
in the western part of Burlington county. In the decade 1889- 
1899 the apple crop increased from 603,890 to 4,640,896 bushels. 
In Monmouth, Camden and parts of Burlington and Gloucester 
counties great quantities of pears are grown. Atlantic, Burlington, 
Camden and Salem counties are the great centres for strawberries ; 
Atlantic, Cumberland and Salem counties lead in grape-growing; 
and a large huckleberry crop is yearly gathered in "the Pines." 
In 1899 New Jersey produced nearly a fourth of the cranberry crop 
of the United States, the chief centre of production bejng thebogs of 
Burlington and Ocean counties. Other fruits grown in considerable 
quantities are cherries, plums, blackberries and raspberries. 

Minerals and Mining. — In 1907 the total value of the state's 
mineral products was $32,800,299. Clays of different degrees of 
value are found in nearly every section, but the principal clay 
mining areas are: the Middlesex county area, where the best clays 
are found along the Raritan river and the coast; the Trenton area, 
in which clay is mined chiefly at Dogtown, E. of Trenton; the 
Delaware river area, in the vicinity of Palmyra; and the Wood- 
mansie area, in Ocean county. As the clay pits contain only small 
amounts of any one kind pi clay, it has proved more profitable for 
manufacturers to buy their raw materials from a number of miners 
than for them to operate the mines themselves, and consequently 
clay mining and the manufacture of clay products are largely 
distinct industries. In New Jersey the mining of clays is more 
important than in any other state, the amount^ mined and sold in 
1902 being a third of the entire output of the United States, and the 
amount in 1907 (440,138 tons) being more than one-fifth of all clay 
mined and sold in the United States; and in 1907 in the value of 
clay products ($16,005,460; brick and tile, $9,019, 834, and pottery, 
$6,985,626) New Jersey was outranked only by Ohio and Pennsyl- 
vania. In Warren and Sussex counties are abundant materials for 
the manufacture of Portland cement, an industry that has attained 
importance since 1892; in the value of its product in 1907 
($4,758,516) New Jersey was surpassed only by Pennsylvania. 
Granite is found in Morris and Sussex counties, but is not extensively 
quarried; there arc extensive quarries of sandstone in the Piedmont 
section; and limestone and trap rock are important mineral 
resources. In 1907 the total value of stone quarried in the state 
was $1,523,312, of which $995,436 was the value of trap rock, 
$274,452 of limestone, $177,667 of sandstone and $75,757 of 
granite. Some roofing slate is produced in Sussex county; in 1907 
the output was valued at $8000. The mining of natural fertilizers — 
white and greensand marls — is a long established industry; the 
output in 1907 was 14,091 tons, valued at $8429. 

Of mineral ores the most important are iron, zinc and copper. 
The manufacture of iron in New Jersey dates from 1674, when the 
metal was reduced from its ores near Shrewsbury, Monmouth 
county. Magnetic ores, found chiefly in Morris, Passaic and Warren 
counties, form the basis of the present industry. Bog ores were 
mined until about 1840; since that date they have had no market. 
The product of the iron mines has fluctuated greatly in quantity, 
being nearly 1,000,000 tons of ore in 1892, 257,235 tons in 1897; 
and 549,760 tons in 1907, when the output was valued at $1,815,586, 
and was about nine-tenths magnetite and one-tenth brown ore. 
The chief places of production are^ Hibernia {(Morris county) and 
Mt Pleasant (Hunterdon county); in 1907 four mines in the state 
produced 316,236 tons. In the production of zinc New Jersey once 
took a prominent part; in 1907 the only producer was The New 
Jersey Zinc Company's mine at Franklin Furnace, Sussex county, 
with an output of 13.573 snor t tons, valued at $1,601,614. The 
chief deposits consist of red oxide, silicate and franklinite, and the 
average zinc content is 23 %. The copper deposits of the state were 
worked to a small extent in colonial days. One of the brass cannon 
used at Yorktown was made of copper taken from the Watchung 
Mountains during the War for Independence. These mountains are 
still the chief source of copper, but the ores, chiefly cuprite, mala- 
chite and chrysocolla, are also found in various parts of the Pied- 
mont region. In the years following 1900 there was renewed interest 
in copper mining. There are many valuable mineral springs in the 
state: for 1907 eleven springs (three in Bergen and two each in 
Morris, Camden and Some/set counties) reported to the U.S. 
Geological Survey the sale of C$2,445 gallons (mostly table water), 
valued at $103,082. Other^minerals, which are not found in com- 
mercial quantities, are lead in the form of galena, in Sussex county; 
graphite, in the crystalline schistose rocks of the Highlands ; molyb- 
denum, in tfle form of a sulphide, in Sussex county; and barytes in 
Mercer and Sussex counties. In Bergen, Warren, Sussex and 
Morris counties are numerous bogs containing peat of a good quality. 

Manufactures, — After 1850 New Jersey made rapid progress in 
manufacturing, which soon became its leading industry. In 1850 
7*7 % of the population were employed as wage-earners in manu- 
facturing establishments; in 1900, 12*8 %. The value of the pro- 
ducts in 1850 was $39,851,256; in 1890, $354,573,571; in 1900, 
$611,748,933. Such figures of the census of 1900 as are comparable 
with those of the special census of! 1905, when only the establishments 
under the factory system were enumerated, show that between 1900 
and 1005 the number of factories increased 9*3 %; the capital, 
49-8 %; and the value of the products, 1 40 % (from $353,005,684 
to $774,369,025). ^ This rapid development is due to the excellent 
transportation facilities, and to the proximity of large markets and 
of great natural resources, such as the clays of New Jersey and the 
coal and iron of Pennsylvania. The chief manufacturing centres in 
($33»587.273). and Trenton ($^2,7 19,945). In 1905, 67-1 % of the 
factories were in municipalities having a population of at least 
8000 in 1900, and their product was 74-1 % (in value) of the total. 
There are indications, however, that industries are slowly shifting 
to the smaller towns. 

The textile industries taken together are the most important of 
the manufacturing industries, having a greater output (in 1900, 
$81,910,850; in 1905, $96,060,407), employing more labourers and 
capital, and paying more wages than any other group. Among the 
various textiles silk takes the first place, the value of the factory 
product in 1900 being $39,966,662, and in 1905, $42,862,907. In 
1900 the value of the silk output was 48-8 % of the total value of 
the textiles, and silk manufacturing was more important than any 
other industry (textile or riot); in 1905, however, owing to the great 
progress in other industries, silk had dropped to fourth place, but 
still contributed 44-6 % of the value of the textiles. In 1900 New 
Jersey furnished 37-3 %, and in 1905, 32-2 % , of the silk products 
of the United States, and was surpassed by no other state. The silk 
industry is centred at Paterson, the chief silk manufacturing city of 
the United States. West Hoboken and Jersey City are also im- 
portant producers. A second textile industry in which New Jersey 
in 1900 and in 1905 took first rank was the manufacture of felt hats; 
the total value of the product in 1905 was $9,540,433, a gain of 
32-3 % since 1900, and constituting 26 % of the value of the product 
of the entire United States. Most of the product comes from the 
cities of Newark and Orange. From 1900 to 1905 the value of the 
worsted goods increased from $6,823 ,721 to $11,925,126, or 74-8 % 

	1 The following statistics of the products for 1900 and for 1905

the greatest gain made by any of the textiles. In this industry New 
Jersey was surpassed only by Massachusetts, Rhode Island and 
Pennsylvania. During this five-year period there was an increase of 
31-2 % (from $6,540,289 to $8,518,527) in the value of the cotton 
goods, manufactured in New Jersey; of 12-6 % (from $2,168,570 
to $2,441,516) in that of linen goods; of 45-3 % (from $1, 748,14a 
to $2,539,178) in that of hosiery and knit goods, and of 14-8 % 
(from $1,522,827 to $1,748,831) in that of carpets and rugs. In 
dyeing and finishing textiles New Jersey was first among the states 
of the Union in 1900 (value, $10,488,963, being 23-3% of the total 
for the country) and in 1905 (value, $11,979,947, being 23-6 % of 
the total for the country) ; Paterson is the centre of this industry 
in New Jersey. 

In the manufacture of clay products, including brick, tiling, terra 
cotta and pottery, the state takes high rank: the total value of 
pottery, terra cotta and fire-clay products increased from $8,940,723, 
in *900 to $11,717,103 in 1905; in 1905 the most valuable pottery 
product was sanitary ware, valued at $3,006,406; and in that year 
New Jersey furnished 18*2 % of the total pottery product of the 
United States, and was surpassed in this industry only by Ohio. 
The city of Trenton is one of the two great centres of the American 
pottery industry, and in 1905 it manufactured more than one-half 
of the state's output of pottery, terra cotta and fire-clay products. 
The pottery products include china, c.c. ware, white granite ware, 
sanitary ware, belleek and porcelain. Much of the raw material for 
this industry, such as ball, flint, and spar clays and kaolin, is im- 
ported from other states. In 1905 the value of brick and tile manu- 
factured in the state was $1,830,080. Glass is also an important 
product of New Jersey; the output being valued at $5,093,822 in 
1900 and at $6,450,195 in 1905. Since 1880, however, the state had 
fallen from second to fourth place (in 1905) in this industry. 

The leading single industry in the state in 1905, as determined by 
the value of its products, was the smelting and refining of copper. 
In 1900 the output was valued at $38,365,131; in 1905, at 
$62,795,713, an increase of 637 %; and in 1905 21-6 % of the 
product of the United States came from New Jersey, The raw 
materials for this industry, however, are imported into New Jersey 
from other states. In the smelting and refining of platinum, nickel, 
gold and silver (not from the ore) there was a striking development 
between 1900 and 1905, the value of the product increasing from 
$469,224 to $7,034,139. The value in 1905 of gold and silver 
reduced and refined (not from the ore) was $5,281,805. The values 
of the other leading manufactures in 1905 were as follows: products 
of foundry and machine shops, $49,425,385 ; iron and steel * (in- 
cluding products of blast furnaces and rolling mills), $23,667,483; 
wire (exclusive of copper wire), $11,103,959; petroleum refining, 
$46,608,984; tanned, curried and finished leather, $21,495,329 
(5th in the United States in 1900 and 1905); malt liquors, 
$17,446,447; slaughter-house # products and packed meats, 
$17,238,076; electrical machinery, supplies and apparatus, 
$13,803,476 (5th in the UnitedStatesin 1900 and in 1905); chemicals,. 
$13,023,629; rubber belting and hose, $9,915,742; jewelry, 
$9,303,646 (^th in the United States in 1900 and in 1905); tobacco, 
cigars and cigarettes, $8,331,611. Other manufactures valued in 
1905 at more than $5,000,000 were: boots and shoes, cars and 
general railway shop work, illuminating and heating gas, lumber 
and planing mill products, phonographs, fertilizers, flour and grist 
mill products, iron and steel ships, refined lard and paper and 
wood pulp. 

Fisheries, — The fisheries of the state are of great commercial 
value. In 1904 the fisheries and the wholesale fish trade gave 
employment to 9094 persons. Until 1901 New Jersey's fisheries 
were more important than those of any other state in the Middle 
or South Atlantic groups; but after that date, owing to a decrease 
in the catch of bluefish, shad, clams and oysters, the annual catch 
of New York and Virginia became more valuable. The great 
length of river and sea front, and the easy communication from all 
parts of the state with the leading urban markets, have brought about 
the development of this industry. The total catch in 1904 was 
90,108,068 lb, valued at $3,385,415, a decline of 28 % in value since 
1901. The chief varieties of the product in 1904, with their value, 
were as follows: oysters, $1,601,953; clams, $430,766; shad, 
$238,517; squeteague (weak-fish), $253,200; bluefish, $120,085; 
menhaden, $109,090; sea bass, $97,903; cod, $53,789. Fishing, 
as a commercial pursuit, is carried on in seventeen counties, and 
attains its greatest importance in Cumberland county, where the 
catch in 1904 was valued at $1,090,157, and the oyster catch alone 
at $1,046,147. In the other counties along the Delaware shad is 
the chief product, and these counties furnish nearly nine-tenths of 
the catch. A small amount of shad is taken also in the Hudson 
river. The value of the shad fisheries has greatly declined since 
1901. Along the coast squeteague is the most abundant edible 
variety taken. Bluefish are very plentiful from 4 to 10 m. off 
Seabnght. The shell fisheries (oysters particularly) are centred in 
Delaware Bay and at Maurice River Cove, in Cumberland county ,. 
but are important also in Cape May, Atlantic, Ocean and Monmouth

	Jersey: at Old Boonton, about 1770, was established a rolling and

counties on the Atlantic seaboard. This industry declined for a 
time, partly on account of the pollution of the streams by sewage 
and the refuse of manufacturing establishments, but laws have been 
enacted for its protection and development. Clams are gathered 
from Perth Amboy to the upper Delaware Bay; the most important 
fisheries being at Keyport, Port Monmouth and Belford. In 1909 
the State Bureau of Shell Fisheries estimated the annual value of 
shell fisheries .in the state at nearly $6,000,000, of which $500,000 
was the value of clams. Monmouth, Ocean and Cape May counties 
furnish large quantities of menhaden, which are utilized for oil and 
fertilizer. This industry in 1904 yielded fertilizer valued at 
$154*360 and oil valued at $33,110. 

Transportation, — In 1905, with a total railway mileagje of 
2274*40, New Jersey possessed an average of 30-22 m. of railway 
for each 100 sq. m. of territory, an average higher than that of any 
other American state; in 1909, according to^ the State Railroad 
Commissioners, the mileage was 2354*63 (including additional 
tracks, sidings, &c, 5471*38 m.). Owing to its geographical position 
the state is crossed by all roads^ reaching New York City from 
the S. and W., and all those reaching Philadelphia from the N. and 
E. Tbe eastern terminals of the southern and western lines running 
from New York City are situated on the western shore of the Hudson 
river, in Weehawken, Hoboken or Jersey City; whence passengers 
and freight are carried by ferry to New York. Jersey City and 
Hoboken are also connected with New York by tunnels under the 
Hudson river. Among these lines are the Erie system, extending 
W. from Jersey City via Buffalo; the New York, Susquehanna & 
Western (subsidiary to the Erie), from Jersey City to Wilkes-Barr6, 
Pennsylvania ; the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western, from Hoboken 
to Buffalo; the Lehigh Valley, from Jersey City to Buffalo; the 
Pennsylvania, from Jersey City to the S. and W. 1 ; the New York, 
Ontario & Western (controlled by the New York, New Haven & 
Hartford), from Weehawken to Oswego; the West Shore (leased 
by the New York Central), from Weehawken to Buffalo; and 
the Central railway of New Jersey (controlled by the Philadelphia 
& Reading), with numerous short lines from Jersey City to the S. 
and \V. These roads also operate numerous branch lines and control 
other short lines built independently. Among the latter class are 
the Atlantic City railway (controlled by the Philadelphia & Reading) 
from Philadelphia to various coast resorts in southern New Jersey; 
and the West Jersey & Seashore (controlled by the Pennsylvania), 
from Philadelphia to Atlantic City and Cape May. The railways 
operating independently of the great " trunk " systems are few and 
unimportant. The excellence of the waggon roads of the state is 
largely due to the plentiful supply of trap rock in New Jersey. 

Of New Jersey's 487 m. of boundary, 319 m. are touched by 
waters navigable for boats of varying draft. There is tidal water 
on the E. and S., and also on the W. as far N. as Trenton. The 
lower Hudson is navigable for the largest ocean-going steamers. 
From Bergen Point to Perth Amboy, W. of Staten Island, lie the 
narrow channels of the Kill van KuII and Arthur Kill, with a minimum- 
depth of 9 or 10 ft. at low water. Raritan Bay, to the S., is navigable 
only for small vessels. There are no good harbours on the Atlantic 
coast. The lower Delaware is navigable for ocean steamships as 
far N. as Camden (opposite Philadelphia), and for small vessels as 
far as Trenton, which is the head of navigation. The only deep 
water terminals of the state are Jersey City and Hoboken. Among 
the rivers the Raritan is navigable to New Brunswick, the Hacken- 
sack for small boats for 20 m. above its mouth, the Rahway as far 
as Rahway, the Great Egg Harbor river as far as May's Landing, 
the Mullica for 20 m. above its mouth, and the Elizabeth river as 
far as Elizabeth* In 1907 an inland waterway from Cape May to 
Bay Head was .planned: the length of this channel, through and 
between coastal sounds from the southernmost part of the state to 
the northern end of Barnegat Bay in the N.E. part of Ocean county, 
was to be about 116-6 m., and the channel was to be 6 ft. deep and 
100 ft. wide. The Delaware and Raritan canal 1 was long a very

	1 In William Winterbotham's An Historical, Geographical, Com- 
	mercial and Philosophical View of the American United States, &c. 
	(London, 1795) there was a discussion of the feasibility of a canal 
	between the Delaware and the Raritan. In 1804 a company was 
	chartered to build such a canal; in 1816 a route was surveyed; 
	in 1823 a commission was appointed which recommended a route 
	and suggested that the state take part in building the canal; in 
	December 1826 a canal company was incorporated with a monopoly 
	of canal and railway privileges within 10 m. of any part of the canal 
	authorized, but Pennsylvania refused permission to use the waters 
	of the Delaware, and the charter lapsed; in 1830 the Delaware and 
	Raritan Canal Company was incorporated by an act which forbade 
	the construction of any other canal within 5 m. of the proposed 
	route of the Delaware and Raritan, and which reserved to the 
	state the right to buy the waterway 30 years (changed in 1831 to 
	50 years) after its completion. Lieutenant (afterwards Commodore)

	tributed greatly to its financial success. In 183 1 it was combined

important artificial waterway. Its .main channel (opened for 
traffic in 1838) extends from Bordentown, Burlington county, on 
the Delaware to New Brunswick, on the Raritan, 44 m.by the canal 
route, and thus carries the waters of the Delaware river entirely 
across the state, discharging them into the Raritan at New Bruns- 
wick. t It is 40 ft. wide at the bottom, 80 ft. at the top. and 9 ft. 
deep; it has a navigable feeder (30 ft. wide at the bottom and 60 ft. 
wide at the top, with a depth of 9 ft.), which is 22 m. long, extending 
from the Delaware at Bull's Head to Trenton. The canal passes 
.through Trenton (the highest point — 56*3 ft. above mean tide), 
Kingston, Griggston, Weston and Bound Brook, and has one lock 
(or more) at each of these places. It is used chiefly for the trans- 
portation of Pennsylvania coal to New York, and is controlled by 
the Pennsylvania railway. The total cost up to 1906 was $5,1 13,749. 
The Morris Canal, 8 opened in 1836, is 50 ft. wide at the surface, 
30 ft. wide at the bottom and 5 ft. deep, and (excluding 4*1 m. of 
feeders) 102*38 m. long, beginning at Jersey City and passing 
through Newark, Bloomfield, Paterson, Little Falls, Boonton, 
Rockaway, Dover, Port Oram, Lake Hopatcong, Hackettstown and 
Washington to Phillipsburg on the Delaware; it is practically in 
two sections, one east and the other west of Lake Hopatcong (Sussex 
and Morris counties; about 928 ft. above sea-level; 9 m. long from 
N.E. to S.W.; maximum width, 1 m.), which is a reservoir and 
feeder for the canal's eastern and western branches, and which was 
enlarged considerably when the canal was built. There is another 
feeder, the Pompton, v6 m. long, in Passaic county. The canal 
crosses the Passaic and Pompton rivers on aqueducts. The Canal 
(the Morris Canal Banking Company) was leased in April 1871 
to the Lehigh Valley Railroad Company for 999 years. It is no 
longer of commercial importance as a waterway. At Phillipsburg it 
connects t with an important coal carrying canal (lying almost 
entirely in Pennsylvania), the property of the Lehigh Coal and 
Navigation Co. (leased to the Central Railroad of New Jersey), 
which follows the Lehigh river to Coalport (Carbon county, Pennsyl- 
vania), penetrating the coal regions of Pennsylvania. 

Population, — The population of the state in 1880 was 1,131,116; 
in 1890, 1,444,933; in 1900, 1,883,669 (431,884 foreign-born, 
and 69,844 negroes); in 1905 (state census) 2,144,134; in 1910, 
2 >537> J 67. Of the native-born white population in 1900, 556,294 
were of foreign parentage, and 825,973 were of native parentage. 
Among the various elements comprising the foreign-born popula- 
tion were 119,598 Germans; 94,844 Irish; 45,428 English; 
41,865 Italians; 19,745 Russians; 14,913 Hungarians; 14,728 
Austrians; 14,357 Poles; 14,211 Scotch; and 10,261 Dutch. 
In 1800 barely 2% of the population was urban; in 1900 80% 
of the inhabitants either lived in cities or were in daily com- 
munication with Philadelphia or New York. The rural popula- 
tion is practically stationary. The chief cities in 1910 were 
Newark (pop. 347,469), Jersey City (267,779), Paterson(i25,6oo), 
Trenton (96,815), Camden (94,538) and Hoboken (70,324). 
Owing to its milder climate and its larger number of cities New 
Jersey has a negro population somewhat larger than that of the 
states of the same latitude farther west. The rate of increase 
of this element, which is greatest in the cities, is about the same 
as that for the white inhabitants. Since 1881 colonies of Hebrews 
have been established in the southern part of the state, among 
them being Alliance (188 1), Rosenhayn (1882), Carmel (1883), 
and, most noted of all, Woodbine, which owes its origin to the 
liberality of Baron de Hirsch, and contains the Baron de Hirsch ^ 
Agricultural and Industrial School. As regards church affilia- 
tion, in 1906 Roman Catholics were the most numerous, with 
441,432 members out of a total of 857,548 communicants of all 
denominations; there were 122,511 Methodists, 79,912 Presby- 
terians, 65,248 Baptists, 53,921 Protestant Episcopalians, 
32,290 members of the Reformed (Dutch) Church in America, 
and 24,147 Lutherans. 

3 The Morris Canal & Banking Company was chartered in 1824 
to build the Morris Canal, which never proved a financial success, 
partly because of the competition of the Delaware Raritan. 
which soon commanded the coal trade, and partly because of physical 
and mechanical defects. It was exempted from all taxation by the 
state, which reserved the right to buy it, at a fair price, in 1923 or, 
without making any oayment, to succeed to the actual ownership 
in 1973 upon the expiration of the charter. The idea of utilizing 
the waters of Lake Hopatcong was that of George P. MacCulloch 
of Morristown. A peculiar feature of the canal was a system of 
inclined planes or railways on which there were cradles, carrying the 
canal boat up (or down) the incline; these were devised by Pro- 
fessor James Renwick (1818-1895) of Columbia College; 12 of them 
in the eastern division raised boats altogether about 720 ft., and 11 
of them in the western division lowered the boats about 690 ft. — the 
I remainder of the grade was overcome by locks. 

Administration.— The state is governed under the constitution 
of 1844, with subsequent amendments of 1875 and of 1897. 
The only other constitution under which the state has been 
gdverned was that of 1776 (see History below). The right of 
suffrage is conferred upon all males, twenty-one years of age and 
over, who have resided in the state for one year and in the county 
for five months preceding the election. 1 Paupers, idiots, insane 
persons and persons who are convicted of crimes which exclude, 
them from being witnesses and who have not been pardoned 
and restored to civil rights are disfranchised. The executive 
power is vested in a governor, who is elected for a term of three 
years and may not serve two successive terms, though he may 
be re-elected after he has been out of office for a full term. He 
must be at least thirty years of age, and must have been a citizen 
of the United States for a least twenty years, and a resident of 
the state seven years next preceding his election. He may not 
be elected by the legislature, during the term for which he is 
elected as governor, to any office under the state or the United 
States governments. He receives a salary of $10,000 a year. 
If the governor die, resign or be removed from office, or if his 
office be otherwise vacant, he is succeeded by the president of the 
Senate, who serves until another governor is elected and qualified. 
The governor's powers under the constitution of 1776 were 
greatly limited by the constitution of 1844. His appointive 
power is unusually large. With the advice and consent of the 
state Senate he selects the secretary of state, attorney-general, 
superintendent of public instruction, chancellor, chief justice, 
judges of the supreme, circuit, inferior and district courts, and 
the so-called " lay " judges of the court of errors and appeals, 
in addition to ihe minor administrative officers who are usually 
appointive in all American states. The governor may make no 
appointments in the last week of his term. The state treasurer, 
comptroller and the commissioners of deeds are appointed 
by the two houses of the legislature in joint session. The 
governor is ex officio a member of the court of pardons, and his 
affirmative vote is necessary in all cases of pardon or commuta- 
tion of sentence (see below). 

The legislative department consists of a Senate and a General 
Assembly. In the Senate each of the 21 counties has one repre- 
sentative, chosen for a term of three years, and about one-third 
of the membership is chosen each year. The members of the 
General Assembly are elected annually, are limited to sixty (the 
actual number in 1909), and are apportioned among the counties 
according to population, with the important proviso, however, 
that every county shall have at least one member. 

The arrangement of senatorial representation is very unequal; 
and the densely populated counties are under-represented. A 
senator must at the time of his election be at least thirty years old, 
and must have been a citizen and inhabitant of the state for four 
years and of his county for one year immediately preceding his 
election; and an assemblyman must at the time of his election be 
at least twenty-one years old, and must have been a citizen and 
inhabitant of the state for two years, and of his county for one year, 
immediately preceding his election. The annual salary of each 
senator and of each member of the General Assembly is $500. 
Money bills originate in the lower house, but the Senate may propose 
amendments. The legislature may not create any debt or liability 
" which shall, single or in the aggregate with any previous debts or 
liabilities, at any time exceed $100,000," except for purposes^ of 
war, to repel invasion or to suppress insurrection, without specifying 
distinctly the purpose or object, providing for the payment of 
interest, and limiting the liability to thirty-five years; and the 
measure as thus passed must be ratified by popular vote. The 
constitution as amended in 18^5 forbids the legislature to pass any 
private or special laws regulating the affairs of towns or counties, 
or to vote state grants to any municipal or industrial corporations or 
societies, and prescribes that in imposing taxes the assessment of 
taxable property shall be according to general laws and by uniform 
rules; and anti-race-track agitation in 1891-1897 led to a further 
amendment prohibiting the legalizing of lotteries, of pool-selling 

The constitution of 1844 limited the suffrage to white males, 
and although this limitation was annulled by the fifteenth amend- 
ment to the Federal Constitution, it was not until 1875 that the 
state by an amendment (adopted on the 7th of September) struck 
the word " white " from its suffrage clause. At the same time 
another amendment was adopted providing that sailors and soldiers 
in the service of the United States in time of war might vote although 
absent from their election districts. 

or of other forms of gambling. The governor may (since 1875) veto 
any item in any appropriation bill, but any bill (or item) may be 
passed over his veto by bare majorities (of all members elected) in 
both houses. Bills not returned to the legislature in five days 
become law, unless the legislature adjourns in the meantime. 
Amendments to the constitution must first be passed by the legis- 
lature at two consecutive sessions (receiving a majority vote of all 
members elected to each house), and then be ratified ^by the voters 
at a special election, and no amendment or amendments may be 
submitted by the legislature to the people oftener than once in 
five years. 

The judicial system is complex and is an interesting develop- 
ment from the English system of the 18th century. At its head 
is a court of errors and appeals composed of the chancellor, the 
justices of the supreme court and six additional " lay " judges. 
The supreme court consists of a chief justice and eight associate 
justices, but it may be held by the chief justice alone or by any 
one of the associate justices. The state is divided into nine 
judicial districts, and each supreme court justice holds circuit 
courts within each county of a judicial district, besides being 
associated with the " president " judge of the court of common 
pleas of each county in holding the court of common pleas, the 
court of quarter sessions, the court of oyer and terminer and the 
orphans' court. One of five additional judges may hold a circuit 
court in the absence of a justice of the supreme court, or the 
" president " judge of a court of common pleas may do so if the 
supreme court justice requests it. In each township there are 
from two to five justices of the peace, any one of whom may 
preside over the " small cause court," which has jurisdiction 
of cases in which the matter in dispute does not exceed $200 
and is not an action of replevin, one in which the charge, is slander, 
trespass or assault, battery or imprisonment, or in which the 
title to real estate is in question. 

The court of common pleas, which may be held either by the 
" president " judge or by a justice of the supreme court, may hear 
appeals from the " small cause court," and has original jurisdiction 
in all civil matters except those in which the title to real estate is in 
question. The court of quarter sessions, which may likewise be held 
by either the judge of the court of common pleas or by a justice of 
tne supreme court, has jurisdiction over all criminal cases except 
those of treason or murder. The court of oyer and terminer is a 
higher criminal court, and has cognizance of all crimes and offences 
whatever. Except in counties having a population of 300,000 or 
more, a justice of the supreme court must preside over it, and the 
judge of the court of common pleas may or may not sit with him; 
in a county having a population of 300,000 or more the judge of 
the court of common pleas may sit alone. Writs of error in cases 
punishable with death are returnable only to the court of errors 
and appeals. No appeals are permitted in criminal cases. The 
orphans* court may be held either by the judge of the court of 
common pleas or by a justice of the supreme court; and it has 
jurisdiction over controversies respecting the existence of wills, the 
fairness of inventories, the right of administration and guardianship, 
the allowance of accounts to executors, administrators, guardians or 
trustees, and over suits for the recovery of legacies and distributive 
shares, but it may refer any matter coming^ before it to a master in 
chancery. The prerogative court, which is presided over by the 
chancellor as ordinary and surrogate-general, or by a vice-ordinary 
and vice-surrogate-general, may hear appeals from the orphans' 
court, and has the authority to grant probate of wills and letters of 
administration and guardianship, and to hear and determine disputes 
arising therein. The court of chancery is administered by a chan- 
cellor, seven vice-chancellors and a numerous masters in chancery. 
Besides the ordinary chancery jurisdiction it hears all applications 
for divorce or nullity of marriage. Appeals from the court of 
chancery as well as writs of error from the supreme court are heard 
by the court of errors and appeals. New Jersey has a court of 
pardons composed of the governor, chancellor and the six " lay " 
judges of the^ court of errors and appeals, and the concurrence of a 
majority of its members, of whom the governor shall be one, is 
necessary to grant a pardon, commute a sentence or remit a fine. 
This court has, also, the authority to grant to a convict a licence 
to be at large upon such security, terms, conditions and limitations 
as it may require. The judges of the several New Jersey courts 
are appointed by the governor with the consent of the Senate for a 
term of years, usually five to seven. 

For the purposes of local government the state is divided into 
counties, cities, townships, towns and boroughs. The govern- 
ment of the towns is administered through a council, clerk, 
collector, assessor, treasurer, &c, chosen by popular vote; that 
of the townships is vested in the annual town meeting, at which 
administrative officers are elected. Any township with more 
than 5000 inhabitants may be incorporated as a town, with its 
government vested in a mayor and council. Any township or 
part thereof with less than 4 sq. m. of territory, and less than 
5000 inhabitants, may be incorporated as a borough, with its 
government vested in a mayor and council. 

In 1903 a law (revised in 1908) was passed providing for the 
conduct at public cost of primary elections for the nomination of 
nearly all elective officers, and for the nomination of delegates to 
party nominating conventions; nominations for primary elections 
are made by petitions signed by at least ten voters (except in very 
small election districts) who make affidavit as to their party affilia- 
tions; the nominee thus indorsed must file a letter of acceptance. 
Under this act a "political party" is one which polled at least 
one-twentieth of the total number of votes cast in the next preceding 
election in the area for which the nomination is made; and in party 
conventions there must be one delegate from each election district, 
and one delegate for each 200 votes cast by the party in the next 
preceding gubernatorial election. 

An act approved on the 10th of April 1908 authorized a Civil 
Service Commission of four members appointed by the governor, 
who choose a chief examiner and a secretary of the commission. 
Civil service rules adopted by this commission went into effect in 
the same year for certain state employes. In 1910 that part of the 
law permitting municipalities to adopt these rules through their 
governing bodies was declared unconstitutional; but municipalities 
may adopt them by popular vote. 

A state Board of Railroad Commissioners (three appointed by 
the governor), created in 1907, became in 1910 a Board of Public 
Utility Commissioners with jurisdiction over all public utilities 
(including telephones and telegraphs); its approval is necessary 
for the issue of stock or bonds, but it has no power to fix rates. 

The state acts concurrently with New York in preserving the 
natural beauties of the Palisades of the Hudson river; and in 
1909 the Palisades Interstate Park, with a front of 13 m. on the 
Hudson, from Fort Lee to Piermont, was dedicated. 

The homestead exempt from sale under seizure is limited to the 
house and lot, not exceeding $1000 in value, of a debtor having a 
family. To entitle the property to exemption, it must be registered 
as a homestead in the office of the county clerk, and it may be 
sold, then, only with the consent of the husband and wife, and the 
proceeds of the sale, to the amount of $1000, must be applied to 
the purchase of another homestead. The exemption does not extend 
to a sale for unpaid taxes, for labour done on the homestead, materials 
furnished to it, or for a debt contracted in the purchase thereof, or 
prior to the recording of the notice. The exemption inures to the 
benefit of the widow and family of the householder until the youngest 
child becomes twenty-one years of age. 

Capital punishment is by electrocution. A law of 1902 provides the 
death penalty for any murderous assault on the president of the United 
States, the chief executive of any state, or the heir to any foreign throne. 

The grounds for an absolute divorce are only two: adultery and 
"wilful, continued and obstinate " desertion for two years; but a 
decree of limited or permanent separation may be obtained in case 
of extreme cruelty. Unless the cause of action is adultery or at 
least one of the parties was a resident of the state at the time the 
cause of action arose and has continued to reside there, no suit for 
a divorce can be begun until one of the parties shall have resided in 
the state for the two years next preceding. Furthermore, the cause 
of action must have been recognized in the jurisdiction in which the 
petitioner resided at the time it arose. 

No child less than fourteen years old is permitted to work in any 
factory, workshop or mill ; and the penalty for each offence is $50. 
The employment of children under sixteen years of age in any 
mercantile establishment for more than 10 hours a day, or 55 hours 
a week, or between 6 o'clock in the evening and 6 o'clock in the 
morning "is prohibited, except one evening each week when they may 
be permitted to work until 9 o'clock, and except in the evenings from 
the 15th to the 25th of December when they may be permitted to 
work until 10 o'clock. There are strict provisions for the protection 
and for the sanitary housing of factory employees, and prohibiting 
sweat-shops. A state law (1899) requires the payment of wages in 
lawful money at least every two weelcs to its employees on the part 
of every firm, association or partnership doing business in the state. 

Education. — During the colonial period there were schools 
maintained by churches, a few town schools of the New England 
type, and, in the latter part of the era, a number of private 
schools. But the schools of colonial New Jersey, especially the 
private schools, were usually taught by incompetent masters, 
and many children were permitted to grow up without any 
schooling whatever. Public interest in education, however, 
began to awaken soon after the close of the War of Independence. 
Under the encouragement of an act of the legislature passed in 
1794 several academies were established. A public school fund 
was established in 181 7. Three years later townships were 
authorized to levy taxes for maintaining schools for poor children. 

The division of townships into school districts and the election 
of three trustees were provided for in 1829. In 1846 each town- 
ship was required to raise as much money for school purposes 
as the state contributed. In 1855 a normal school for training 
teachers was established at Trenton. And in 1867 a school law 
was passed which established the main features of the present 
school system, although it was four years later before a state 
school tax was imposed and schools were made free to all 
children in the state. The public school system is administered 
under the direction of a superintendent of public instruction 
and a state board of education. The former decides all con- 
troversies arising under the school law, and exercises a general 
supervision over the public schools; the latter has the control of 
a number of special state educational institutions, appoints 
the county superintendents and supervises the execution of the 
school laws of the state. In general each city, town and township 
in the state constitutes a separate school district, although two 
or more of these may unite to form a single district. Each district 
is required to furnish free textbooks. All children between the 
ages of 7 and 1 5 are required to attend school for the full school 
year, and those who at 15 years of age have not completed 
the grammar school course must continue to attend until they 
either complete it or arrive at the age of 17. Furthermore, 
children past 15 years of age who have completed the grammar 
school course but are not regularly and lawfully employed at 
some useful occupation must attend a high school or a manual 
training school until 17 years of age. 

Funds for the support of the public schools are derived from 
various sources: (1) the interest on the " surplus revenue " 
($760,670), deposited with New Jersey by the Federal government 
in 1836; (2) the income from the state school fund, consisting 
largely of receipts from the sale and rental of riparian lands *; (3) a 
state school tax; (4) a direct appropriation by the legislature to 
supplement the school tax, so that the two combined will form a 
sum equal to a tax of two and three-fourths mills on each dollar of 
taxable property; and (5) local taxes. At the close of the fiscal 
year 1908 the school fund of the state was $4,850,602*41; the 
income for the year was $224,233*56 and the disbursements were 
$373*095*76. The income from the state school fund is divided 
among the counties on the basis of the total number of days of 
attendance of the public school pupils; the legislative appropriation, 
however, is apportioned among the counties according to their 
assessed property values. Each county also received 90% of the 
state school tax it has paid, the remainder forming a reserve fund 
to be distributed among the counties at the discretion of the state 
board. The state will duplicate any yearly sum between $250 and 
$5000 which a school district may raise to maintain a school or 
courses of manual training, in like manner, any school that raises 
$20 for a library will receive the same amount from the state, 
which will also contribute $10 each year thereafter for maintenance, 
if the school raises a similar sum. The total number of teachers 
in the public schools in 1908 was 10,279; the total school enrollment 
was 402,866, with an average daily attendance of 289,167; and the 
average length of the school term was nine months and two days. 
For the benefit of veteran and invalid public school teachers there 
is a " retirement fund," which owes its origin to voluntary con- 
tributions by teachers in active service. The state has taken 
official recognition of this fund and administers it on behalf of the 
contributors through a board of trustees appointed by the governor. 

In addition to the regular public schools, the state maintains sl 
normal and a model school at Trenton, a normal school at Montclair 
(opened 1908), the Farnum Preparatory School at Beverly, a Manual 
Training and Industrial School for Colored Youth at Bordentown, 
and an agricultural college and experiment station, maintained in 
connexion with Rutgers College, at New Brunswick. There are 
industrial schools in Newark, Hoboken and Trenton, for which the 
state made an appropriation of $20,000 in 1908. Among the 
prominent institutions not receiving state aid are Princeton Uni- 
versity, at Princeton; Rutgers College (excluding its agricultural 
school), at New Brunswick; and the Stevens Institute of Techno- 
logy, at Hoboken. Among the denominational institutions are the 
Theological Seminary (Presbyterian)^ at Princeton; the Drew 
Theological Seminary (Methodist Episcopal) at Madison; Seton 
Hall College (Roman Qatholic), at South Orange; St Peter's College 
(Roman Catholic) at Jersey 'City; St Benedict's College (Roman 
Catholic) at Newark; the German Theological School of Newark 

	1 The state's title to its riparian lands was established, after a 
	long controversy, in 1870 in the case of Stevens v. the Pater son & 
	Newark R.R. Co. (5 Vroom's Reports 532). Since that date, with 
	the exception of the period of Governor Abbett's second administra- 
	tion (1890-1893), the proceeds from the sale and rental of these 
	lands have been regularly applied to the school fund. 

(Presbyterian) at Bioomfiekt; and the Theological Seminary of the 
(Dutch) Reformed Church in America, at New Brunswick. ^ There 
are many private academies and secondary schools, sectarian and 
non-sectarian. # 

The state supports the following charitable and correctional 
institutions all under the inspection of a State Department of 
Charities and Correction (1905) ; hospitals for the insane at Trenton 
and Morris Piains; a training-school for feeble-minded children 
(partly supported by the state) and a home for feeble-minded women 
at Vineland ; a sanatorium for tuberculous diseases at Glen Gardner; 
a village for epileptics, with a farm of 700 acres, near Skillman, 
Somerset county; a state home (reform ^ school) for boys near 
Jamesburg, Middlesex county, and for girls in Ewing township, near 
Trenton ; a state reformatory for criminals sixteen to thirty years of 
age, near Rahway; a state prison at Trenton; a home for disabled 
soldiers at Kearney, 1 Hudson county; a home for disabled soldiers, 
sailors and their wives at Vineland 2 ; and a school for the deaf at 
Trenton. There is no institution for the blind, but the state pays the 
expenses of blind children who are sent from New Jersey to the New 
York State School for the Blind. A State Board of Children's 
Guardians, with an office in Jersey City, cares for destitute children. 
A convict parole law went into operation in 1891. 

Finance, — The revenues for state and for local purposes are 
derived from separate sources. The expenses of the state 
government are met chiefly by special taxes on railway and 
canal corporations, a franchise tax on the capital stock of other 
corporations, a collateral inheritance tax and leases of riparian 
lands. The counties and municipalities derive their revenues 
chiefly from taxes on real and personal property. Real and 
personal property is free from a state tax, except for school 
purposes. The school tax is apportioned among the counties 
in proportion to their taxable property. 

A large part of the state's revenue comes from the tax on railways 
and canals, which is levied on the property actually employed in 
their operation. Any property of railways other than the " main 
stein " (i.e. the road-bed with the rails and sleepers not over 100 ft. 
in width), 3 that is employed in operating the road or canal is taxed 
by the state for local purposes. Counties and municipalities may 
tax property within their jurisdiction belonging to railways but not 
actually used for railway purposes. Domestic telegraph, telephone, 
express, cable, parlour- and sleeping-car, gas- and ejectric-lighting, 
oil and pipe line companies, and several classes of insurance com- 
panies, are taxed on the amount of their gross receipts. Other 
domestic corporations are taxed on the amount of their capital 
stocky The rate of this tax decreases as the amount of capital 
stock increases, thus favouring large corporations. On all capital 
stock up to $3,000,000, the rate is one-tenth of 1 %; on all amounts 
between three and five million dollars, the rate is one-twentieth of 
1 %; and on all above five million dollars, thirty dollars per million, 
or 3/1000 of 1 %. An inheritance tax is levied on all bequests in excess 
of $500 to persons other than specially excepted classes; and in 
1907 the receipts from the " collateral inheritance tax " were 
$241,480. County and municipal revenue are derived from the tax 
on general property. The poll tax is restricted almost entirely to 
municipalities, which devote the proceeds to roads and schools. 
The fees received for issuing charters to corporations are another 
source of revenue to the state. Toward corporations the policy of 
New Jersey has always been liberal; there is no limit fixed either 
to capitalization or to bonded indebtedness ; the tax rate, as already 
indicated, is lower for large than for small corporations; and so 
many large combinations of capital have been incorporated under 
the kws of the state that it is sometimes called " the home of the 
trusts." For the fiscal year 1907 the fees collected from corpora- 
tions by the secretary of state amounted to $204,454, the receipts 
from the tax on corporations other than railways amounted to 
$2,584,363-60, and the receipts from the tax on railway corporations 
were $807, 780. 4 It is the revenue from these sources that has 
enabled New Jersey to dispense almost entirely with the general 
property^ tax for state purposes. The legal requirement that every 
corporation chartered by the state must maintain its principal office 
there has given rise to the peculiar institution called the " corporation 
agency," a single office which serves as the " principal office " of 
numbers of corporations. At the close of the fiscal year 1907 the 
state was free from bonded indebtedness, 6 and had a balance on hand 
of $1,320,038 (much less than in 1906, because of the non-payment 
of railway taxes, pending litigation). In the state fund, the total 

	1 Also receives Federal aid. 2 Idem, 

	8 Passenger stations and depot buildings were included as part of 
	the " main stem " until 1906, when their exclusion gave considerable 
	added revenue to the municipalities. 

	* The tax on railway corpora cions collected by the state for local 
	purposes and paid over to the local governments in 1907 amounted 
	to $581,794. 

	6 The only state debt is state certificates for $116,000 issued to 
	the commissioners of the Agricultural College. 

receipts for the year were $4,602,100, and the total disbursements,. 
$5*366,813. 

History. — Bones and implements have been found in the 
Quaternary gravels at Trenton, which have been held by some 
authorities to prove the presence of Palaeolithic man; but the 
earliest inhabitants of New Jersey of whom there is any certain 
record were the Lenni-Lennape or Delaware Indians, a branch 
of the Algonquian family. They were most numerous in the 
southern and central portions of the stale, preferring the river 
valleys; but their total number, perhaps, never exceeded a 
thousand. Between them and the European settlers there were 
seldom any manifestations of acute hostility, though each race 
feared and distrusted the other. Many Indians were enslaved, 
and intermarriage between them and negro slaves became 
common. During the 18th century the Indian title to the soil 
was rapidly extinguished, and at the same time the vices and 
diseases of the stronger race were gradually reducing their 
numbers. In 1758 an Indian reservation, said to have been the 
first established within the present limits of the United States, 
was established at Edgepelick, or Brotherton (now called Indian 
Mills) in Burlington county. The surviving aborigines remained 
there until 1802, when they joined the Mohegans in New York 
and migrated to Wisconsin and later to Indian Territory, now part 
of the state of Oklahoma. For the extinction of all Indian titles 
the legislature of New Jersey in 1832 appropriated $2000, and 
sfcice that date almost every vestige of Indian occupation has 
disappeared. 

The first authenticated visit of a European to what is now 
New Jersey was made under French authority by Giovanni da 
Verrazano, a Florentine navigator, who in the spring of 1524 
sailed within Sandy Hook and dropped anchor in the waters of 
upper New York Bay. Jn the following year Estevan Gomez, a 
Portuguese sailor in the service of the emperor Charles V., in his 
reputed voyage southward from Labrador, is said to have made 
note of the Hudson and Delaware rivers. It is very probable, 
also, that French traders soon afterward penetrated the region 
along the lower Hudson. Voyages to this region for exploration, 
trade and settlement, however, may be said to have really begun 
with the year 1609, when Henry Hudson explored the region 
between Sandy Hook and Raritan Bay and sailed up the river 
which now bears his name. After this voyage came Dutch 
traders, who established themselves on Manhattan Island and 
soon spread across the Hudson river into what are now Hudson 
and Bergen counties. In 1614 Cornells Jacobsen Mey explored 
the lower Delaware, and two years later Cornells Hendricksen 
more thoroughly explored this stream. In 1623 the first party 
of permanent homeseekers arrived at New Amsterdam, and a 
portion of these formed a settlement on the eastern bank of 
the Delaware and built Fort Nassau near the site of the present 
Gloucester City. In 163 1 Samuel Godyn and Samuel Blommaert 
secured a patent from Peter Minuit, the director of New Nether- 
land, authorizing them to plant a settlement near Cape May, 
but the effort was soon abandoned. A trading hut built at 
Paulus Hook in 1633 was the beginning of the present Jersey 
City. On the western l>ank of the Hudson the trading post of 
Hobocanhackingh, on the site of the present city of Hoboken, 
was established at an early date. From these places and from 
New Amsterdam the Dutch spread into the Raritan Valley. 
During the rule of Governor William Kief t, the Indians, disturbed 
by the encroachments of the settlers, assumed a hostile attitude. 
The actual occasion of the Indian outbreak was the massacre 
of a number of Tappan Indians in 1643 by soldiers acting under 
Kief t's orders. From the Connecticut to the Raritan the savages 
rose in arms, laid waste the farms, massacred the settlers and 
compelled those who escaped to take refuge on Manhattan 
Island. The Dutch engaged the services of about fifty English- 
men under Captain John Underhill, a hero of the Pequot War, 
and in 1644 the Indians were defeated in several engagements, 
but a general peace with them was not established until the 
30th of August 1645. 

In the meantime colonists of another nationality had set 
foot on the shores of the lower Delaware. To found a colony in 
the new world was long the desire of Gustavus Adolphus of 
Sweden, but incessant European wars prevented the establish- 
ment of any settlement until after his death. In 1638 fifty 
colonists landed on the western bank of the Delaware and built 
Fort Christina on the site of the modern Wilmington. Five 
years later, on the eastern bank a triangular fort, called Elfsborg, 
was constructed near the present Salem. But the Swedish rule 
was short-lived, as in 1655 the settlements surrendered to Peter 
Stuyvesant and passed under the control of the Dutch. Upon the 
subsequent history of New Jersey the uttempts of Holland and 
Sweden at colonization had very little influence. The Dutch and 
Swedes between the Delaware and the Hudson were mostly 
traders, and therefore did not make many permanent settle- 
ments or establish forms of government. 

By the English of New England and Virginia the Dutch 
and Swedes were regarded as intruders, and were repeatedly 
warned against trespassing on English soil. 1 As early as 1634 a 
patent had been issued to Sir Edmund Plowden, appointing 
him governor over New Albion, a tract of land including the 
present states of New Jersey, Delaware, Maryland and Penn- 
sylvania. In spite of great efforts, however, Sir Edmund failed 
to plant a colony. 2 In 1634 a party of English from Virginia, 
having ascended the Delaware and occupied Fort Nassau, 
which the Dutch had abandoned, were promptly captured by 
the Dutch, taken to New Amsterdam, and thence sent home, 
arriving just in time to prevent the departure of a second English 
expedition up the Delaware. In 1641 English colonists from New 
Haven migrated southward and planted a settlement on the 
eastern bank of the Delaware river, declaring it to be a part of 
the New Haven jurisdiction. In the following year Governor 
Kieft, with the assistance of the Swedes, arrested the Engb'sh 
and sent them back to New Haven. 

Many years elapsed before an English sovereign made any 
effort to oust the Dutch from the dominions he claimed by 
virtue of the discovery of the Cabots. On the 12th of March 
1664 Charles H. bestowed upon his brother James, duke of York, 
all the lands between the Connecticut river and the eastern side 
of Delaware Bay, as well as all the islands between Cape Cod 
and the Hudson river. An expedition was sent from England in 
May, under the command of Richard Nicolls, and in the following 
August the English flag floated over New Amsterdam. In 
October Sir Robert Carr took possession of the settlements 
on the Delaware, and terminated the rule of the Dutch. The 
few inhabitants of what is now New Jersey acquiesced in the new 
order. While the expedition commanded by Nicolls was still at 
sea, the duke of York, by deeds of lease and release, transferred 
to Lord John Berkeley, baron of Stratton, and Sir George 
Carteret (q.v.) t all that part of his new possessions extending 
eastward from the Delaware Bay and river to the Atlantic 
Ocean and the Hudson river, and northward from Cape May to a 
line drawn from the northernmost branch of the Delaware, 
" which is 41 40' lat.," to the Hudson river in 41 N. lat. To 
this tract the name of Nova Caesarea, or New Jersey, was given, 
as the same name had been given in a patent to Carteret issued 
in 1650, to " a certain island and adjacent islets" near Virginia, 
in America, which were never settled — in honour of Carteret, 
who governed the isle of Jersey in 1 643-1 651 and there enter- 
tained Prince Charles during his exile from England. The 

	1 As early as 1613, Captain Samuel Argall, on his way to Virginia, 
	after breaking up some Jesuit settlements at Port Royal, and Mount 
	Desert, passed through the Narrows near the mouth of the Hudson, 
	and finding a group of Dutch traders, made them hauldown their 
	flag and replace it with that of England. In the spring of 1620 
	Thomas Dermer, an English ship captain, on his way from Monhegan 
	to Virginia, visited Manhattan Island and told the Dutch traders 
	that they would not be allowed to remain. In 1627 Governor 
	William Bradford of Plymouth protested by letter to the Dutch 
	against their occupancy, and this warning from the Pilgrims was 
	repeated at least twice. 

	* As late as 1784, Charles Varlo, an Englishman who had 
	purchased one-third of the grant from the heirs of Sir Edmund 
	lowden, came to New Jersey and sought to substantiate his 
	claim. Failing in a suit in chancery to obtain redress, he returned 
	to England, and nothing further was heard of the claimants to 
	New Albion. 

grant conferred upon Berkeley and Carteret all the territorial 
rights which the royal charter had conferred upon the duke of 
York; but whether or not the rights of government went with 
these soon became a vexed question. In order to attract immi- 
grants, the proprietors in February 1665 published their " Con- 
cession and Agreement," by which they made provision for a 
governor, a governor's council, and an assembly chosen by the 
freemen and having the power to levy taxes. Special inducements 
in the way of land grants were offered to persons embarking 
with the first governor. In the meantime Governor Nicolls 
of New York, ignorant of the grant to Berkeley and Carteret, 
had approved certain Indian sales of land to settlers within New 
Jersey, and had confirmed their titles to tracts in what later 
became Elizabethtown, Middletown and Shrewsbury. In this 
way he unconsciously opened the way for future trouble. 
Moreover, when he had learned that the duke had parted with 
New Jersey he convinced him that it was a great loss, and in the 
effort to save what was possible, Staten Island was taken from 
the proprietors on the plea that one arm of the Hudson flowed 
along its western border. 

In August 1665 Philip Carteret, a relative of Sir George, arrived 
in the province as its first governor. In May 1668 he convoked 
the first assembly at Elizabethtown. At the next session, in 
the following November, the towns of Shrewsbury and Middle- 
town declared that they held their grants from Governor Nicolls, 
and that they were consequently exempt from any quit-rents 
the proprietors might claim. They refused to pay their share of 
the public expenses; and their deputies, on refusing to take the 
oath of allegiance and fidelity, were expelled from the assembly. 
The disaffection soon spread and led to the sooJIed " disorgan- 
izing" assembly in 1672, which went so far as to choose James 
Carteret, a landgrave of Carolina and presumably a natural 
son of Sir George, as " President." Philip Carteret returned 
to England and laid the case before the proprietors; they 
ordered President Carteret to continue on his way to Carolina 
and confirmed as governor John Berry, whom Governor Carteret 
had left behind as deputy. The duke of York declared that the 
grants made by Nicolls were null and void; the king enjoined 
obedience to the proprietors, and quiet was restored. Another 
change was impending, however, and in August 1673, when a 
Dutch fleet appeared off Staten Island, New Jersey for a second 
time became a part of New Netherland. The settled region was 
called " Achter Koll," or " Back Bay," after Newark Bay, 
whose waters, lying behind the bay of New York, had to be 
crossed in order to reach Elizabethtown. The period of Dutch 
rule was short, and by the treaty of Westminster, of the 9th 
of February 1674, the territory was restored to England. The 
crown lawyers decided that the rights of the proprietors of New 
York and New Jersey had been extinguished by the conquest, 
and that by treaty the lands had been reconveyed, not to the 
proprietors, but to the king. On the 13th of June 1674 Charles 
II. accordingly wrote a letter confirming the title and power of 
Carteret in the eastern half of New Jersey. No similar grant 
was made to Berkeley, as on the 18th of March he had sold his 
interest in the province to John Fenwicke, sometime major in 
the Parliamentary army and later a member of the Society of 
Friends, and Edward Byllynge (d. 1687), a Quaker merchant. 8 
On the 29th of June the duke of York received a new patent 
similar to that of 1664, and he at once (on the 28th and 29th of 
July) confirmed Carteret in all his rights in that portion of New 
Jersey N.of a line drawn from Barnegat Creek to " Rankokus 
Kill " — a stream a little S. of the site of Burlington — which was 
considerably more than one-half of the province. The duke of 
York commissioned Sir Edmund Andros as governor of his 
dominions, including " all ye land from ye West side of Connecti- 
cut River to ye East side of Delaware Bay." Sir George Carteret 
again sent over his kinsman Philip Carteret to be governor of 
the eastern part of New Jersey, and the two governors arrived 
in October 1674 in the same ship. A disagreement arose as to 

	* It has been supposed that Fenwicke and Byllynge intended to 
	establish in America a retreat for those who desired religious and 
	political freedom. 

the respective interests of Fenwicke and Byllynge in the western 
portion of the province, and they chose William Penn, a new 
member of the Society of Friends, as arbitrator. To Byllynge 
Penn awarded nine-tenths of the territory and to Fenwicke 
one- tenth. Financial embarrassments a short time afterward 
caused Byllynge to assign his shares in trust for his creditors 
to three Quakers, William Penn, Gawen Lawrie and Nicholas 
Lucas. Later they acquired control of Fenwicke's share also. 
In 1675 Fenwicke with his family and a company of settlers 
reached the Delaware in the ship " Griffith " from London, and 
on the eastern shore they formed a settlement to which they gave 
the name of Salem. This was the first permanent English 
settlement in this part of New Jersey. Refusing to recognize 
Fenwicke's jurisdiction, Governor Andros of New York attempted 
to secure his peaceful recognition of the duke's authority, and, 
failing in this, he sent a military force into this district in 
December 1676 and made Fenwicke a prisoner. In January, 
however, he was released on his promise not to act in a public 
capacity until he should receive further authority. Meanwhile 
the trustees of Byllynge were seeking a division of the province 
more to their advantage and, Sir George Carteret having been 
persuaded by the duke of York to surrender his grant of July 
1674, the so-called " quintipartite deed " was executed on the 
1st of July 1676. This instrument denned the" interests of 
Carteret, Penn, Lawrie, Lucas and Byllynge, by fixing a line of 
partition from Little Egg Harbor to a point on the Delaware 
river, in 41 40' N. lat., and hy assigning the province east of 
this line (East Jersey) to Carteret and the province west of this 
line (West Jersey), about five-eighths of the whole, to the Quaker 
associates. The Quakers' title to West Jersey, however, still bore 
the cloud resulting from the Dutch conquest, and the duke of 
York had desired to recover all of his original grant to Berkeley 
and Carteret ever since Governor Nicolls had protested against it. 
But at this time his own right to the crown of England was 
threatened with the Exclusion Bill, and under these conditions 
instead of pressing his case against the Quakers he not only 
permitted it to be decided against him but in August 1680 
confirmed their title by a new deed. 

A very liberal frame of government for West Jersey, drafted 
presumably by William Penn, and entitled " the Concessions and 
Agreements of the Proprietors, Freeholders and Inhabitants of 
West Jersey in America," was adopted in March 1677. This 
vested the principal powers of government in an assembly of one 
hundred members, who were to be chosen annually and to be 
subject to instructions from their constituents. In the intervals 
between sessions of the assembly, affairs were to be managed by 
ten commissioners chosen by that hody. Religious toleration 
was assured. In August 1677 the ship " Kent " arrived in the 
Delaware, with 230 Quakers from London and Yorkshire. These 
founded a settlement, which became the modern Burlington, 
and in the next few months several hundred more colonists 
arrived. But the new colony was never actually governed 
under "the Concessions and Agreements"; for from the 
beginning until the first assembly was called in November 1681 
its affairs were managed hy commissioners named by the pro- 
prietors and when in 1680 the duke of York confirmed the title 
to the land to Byllynge and his associates he conveyed the right 
to govern to Byllynge alone. Although he was one of the signers 
of " the Concessions and Agreements " Byllynge now com- 
missioned Samuel Jennings as governor of the province, and the 
other proprietors acquiesced, appointing Byllynge 'governor and 
permitting Jennings to serve as his deputy. Jennings immediately 
called the first assemhly, and this body passed a number of 
fundamental laws which provided for a governor and council, 
but were in other respects much like the clauses relating to 
government in " the Concessions and Agreements." When, as 
if, to test his authority, Byllynge, in 1682-1683, removed Jennings 
who had been a popular governor, the assembly, by the advice 
of William Penn, passed a series of resolutions in the form of a 
protest, and in 1684 two agents were sent to England to negotiate 
with Byllynge. There the dispute was finally submitted for 
arbitration to George Fox and other Quakers, and they decided 
that, as the government of the province was legally vested in 
Byllynge by the duke's conveyance to him, he had the right 
to name the deputy governor. Fenwicke, after his release by 
Andros, endeavoured to re-establish a government at Salem with 
himself as " Lord and Chief Proprietor " of West Jersey, but the 
duke's officers further contested his claims and in 1682 Penn 
effected a peaceful settlement with him. 

In East Jersey, after the return of Governor Carteret, there 
was a period of quiet, until the death of Sir George Carteret in 
. 1680 gave the zealous Andros another chance to further the 
supposed interests of his ducal master. Claiming jurisdiction 
over New Jersey by the terms of his commission, he issued a 
proclamation in March 1680 ordering Philip Carteret and his 
" pretended " officers to cease exercising jurisdiction within 
the duke's dominions unless he could show warrant. To this 
Carteret made a spirited reply, and on the 30th of April a detach- 
ment of soldiers dragged the governor of East Jersey from his 
bed and carried him prisoner to New York. Here he was confined 
for four weeks, and was released only on his promise not to 
exercise any authority until the matter could be referred to 
England for adjudication. When the assembly of East Jersey 
met in June, Andros appeared before it as governor and recom- 
mended such measures as he deemed advisable, hut the deputies 
refused to pass them. In England, too, his conduct was dis- 
avowed, and he was called home to answer charges that had been 
preferred against him. Philip Carteret reassumed the duties 
of his ofncej but his administration, now that Andros was no 
longer feared, was again marked by much friction with the 
assemhly. Sir George Carteret had bequeathed his province 
to eight trustees, who were to administer it for the benefit of 
his creditors, and for the next two years the government was 
conducted in the name of his widow and executrix, Lady 
Elizabeth. Early in 1682, after several unsuccessful attempts 
to effect a sale by other means, the province was offered for sale 
at public auction, and was purchased by William Penn and 
eleven associates for £3400. Later each of these twelve sold one- 
half of his share to another associate, thus making twenty-four 
proprietors; and on the 14th of March the duke of York con-, 
firmed the sale, and gave them all the powers necessary for 
governing the province. Robert Barclay, one of the proprietors, 
was chosen governor for life, with" the privilege of performing 
his duties by deputy, and as his deputy he sent over Thomas 
Rudyard. In 1683 Rudyard was succeeded by Gawen Lawrie, 
who brought over with him a curious frame of government 
entitled " the Fundamental Constitutions." This instrument, 
which was designed to replace the Concessions, provided for the 
government of the province hy a governor chosen by the pro- 
prietors, a common council consisting of the proprietors or their 
proxies together with 12 freemen, and a great council consisting 
of the proprietors or their proxies together with 144 freemen 
chosen by a mixed system of elections and the casting of lots. 
But the new system was to apply only to those who, in return 
for the greater privileges which it was alleged to ensure, would 
agree to a resurvey of their lands, arrange to pay quit-rents and 
provide for the permanent support of the government, and as 
Governor Lawrie found the colonists generally unwilling to make 
the exchange on the proposed terms, he discreetly refrained from 
any attempt to put the Fundamental Constitutions in operation 
and thereby avoided the confusion which must have resulted 
from two sets of laws. The government of the twenty-four 
proprietors, however, was liberal. Recognizing the necessity 
of some one in the province with full power " to do all things 
that may contribute to the good and advancement of the same," 
they directed the appointment of the American Board of Pro- 
prietors — a body of men identified with the province, who with 
the deputy-governor were to look after the proprietary interests 
in such matters as the approval of legislation and the granting 
of lands, and thereby prevent the delay caused hy the transmis- 
sion of such matters to England for approval. In 1686 another 
effort was made to put the Fundamental Constitutions in force, 
but when the deputies and the council rejected the instrument, 
the proprietors did not force the matter. In 1686 Perth Amboy, 
the newly created port of East Jersey, became its seat of govern- 
ment. 

After his accession to the throne in 1685, James II. showed an 
unyielding determination to annul the privileges of the colonies, 
and to unite New York, New Jersey and the New England 
colonies under a single government. In order, therefore, to 
save their rights in the soil, the proprietors of East and West 
Jersey offered to surrender their claims to jurisdiction, and 
to this arrangement the king consented. Andros, previously 
appointed viceroy of New England, thereupon received a new 
commission extending his authority over New York and the 
Jerseys, and in August 1688 he formally annexed these provinces 
to the Dominion of New England. The seizure of Andros by the 
people of Boston in April 1689, following the news of the revolt 
in England against James II., gave the Jersey proprietors an 
opportunity to resume their rights, but the proprietary govern- 
ments regained their former footing very slowly. The pro- 
prietors were widely separated — some being in America, some 
in England and others in Scotland — and unity of action was 
impracticable. For three years there was little or no government 
in the Jerseys, beyond the measures taken by local officers for 
preserving the peace. 

In 1692 an important change occurred in the administrative 
system through the appointment of Andrew Hamilton (d. 1703) 
as governor of both East and West Jersey. In 1697 a faction 
opposed to Hamilton secured his removal and the appointment 
of their partisan, Jeremiah Basse. The opposition in the two 
colonies to Basse became so formidable that he was removed 
in 1699 and Hamilton was reappointed. Certain disaffected 
elements thereupon refused to recognize his authority, on the 
ground that his appointment had not received the required 
approval of the crown, and for a time the condition of the 
provinces bordered on anarchy. These disorders, and especially 
complaints against the Jerseys as centres of illegal trade', were 
brought to the attention of King William and his lawyers 
contended that as only the king could convey powers of govern- 
ment those exercised by the Jersey proprietors, derived as they 
were from the duke of York, were without sufficient warrant. 
Moreover, the inhabitants sent petitions to England, praying 
that they might be placed under the direct control of the crown. 
The proprietors of East Jersey had already offered to surrender 
their jurisdiction, in return for certain concessions by the royal 
government, but no action had been taken. In 1701 the pro- 
prietors of both provinces made another proposal, which was 
accepted, and in April 1702 all rights of jurisdiction were trans- 
ferred to the crown, while the rights to the soil remained in the 
proprietors. The provinces of East and West Jersey were then 
united under a government similar to that of the other royal 
provinces. Until 1738 the governor of New York was also 
governor of New Jersey; after that dsrte each colony had its 
own governor. The legislature met alternately at Burlington 
and Perth Amboy, until 1790, when Trenton was selected as the 
capital of the state. 

The next four decades were years of development disturbed, 
however, by friction between the assembly and the royal 
governors, and by bitter disputes, accompanied by much rioting, 
with the proprietors concerning land-titles (1 744-1 749). Inde- 
pendence of the absentee landlords was again claimed by virtue 
of the grants made by Nicolls nearly a century before. Agri- 
culture at this time was the main pursuit. The climate was 
more temperate and the soil more fertile than that of New 
England; but there were similar small farms and no marked 
tendencies towards the plantation system of the southern colonies. 
Slavery had been introduced by the Dutch and Swedes, and 
from the time of the earliest English occupation had been legally 
recognized. East Jersey had a fugitive slave law as early as 1675. 
With the exception of laying an import duty no legislative 
effort was made — nor is it likely that any would have been 
allowed by the crown — to restrict the importation of slaves during 
the colonial period. In addition to African and Indian slaves 
there was the class known as " redemptioners," or term slaves, 
consisting of indented servants, who bound themselves to their 
masters before leaving the mother country, and " free witters," 
who allowed themselves to be sold after reaching America, in 
order to reimburse the ship captain for the cost of their passage. 
Between East and West Jersey certain political and religious 
differences developed. The former, settled largely by people 
from New England and Long Island, was dominated by Puritans; 
the latter by Quakers. In East Jersey, as in New England, 
the township became a vigorous element of local government; 
in West Jersey the county became the, unit. Important events 
in the period of royal government were the preaching of George 
Whitefield in 1739 and the following years, and the chartering 
of the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) in 1 746, 
and of Queen's (now Rutgers) College in 1766. The colony 
gave many proofs of its loyalty to the mother country: it 
furnished three companies of troops for Admiral Vernon's 
unfortunate expedition against Cartagena in 1741; in King 
George's War it raised £2000 for supplies, furnished troops for 
the capture of Louisburg and sent over six hundred men to 
Albany; and in the French and Indian (or Seven Years') War 
its militia participated in the capture of both Quebec and 
Havana. Against England the colony had fewer grievances 
than did some of its more commercial neighbours, but the Stamp 
Act and the subsequent efforts to tax tea aroused great opposi- 
tion. In 1774 occurred the "Greenwich Tea Party." 1 

The last colonial assembly of New Jersey met in November 
1775, From the 26th of May to the 2nd of July 1776 the second 
provincial congress met at Burlington, Trenton and New Bruns- 
wick and for a time became the supreme governing power. By 
its orders the royal governor, William Franklin (the natural son 
of Benjamin Franklin) was arrested and deported to Connecticut, 
where he remained a prisoner for two years, until exchanged and 
taken to New York under British protection. Following the 
recommendation of the Continental Congress, that the colonies 
should create independent governments, the provincial congress 
also drafted a provincial constitution, which, without being 
submitted to the people, was published on the 3rd of July 1776; 
it contained the stipulation that "if a reconciliation between 
Great Britain-and these colonies should take place, and the latter 
be taken again under the protection of the crown of Britain, this 
charter shall be null and void — otherwise to remain firm and 
inviolable." On the 20th of September 1777 it was amended by 
the New Jersey legislature, the words "state" and "states" 
being substituted for Ihe words " colony" (or " province" ) 
and " colonies." The state furnished a full quota for the 
Continental army, but the divided sentiment of the people is 
shown by the fact that six battalions of loyalists were also 
organized. Tories were active in New Jersey throughout the 
struggle; among them were bands known as " Pine Robbers," 
who hid in the pines or along the dunes by day and made their 
raids at night. In the state were fought some of the most 
important engagements of the war. When Washington, in the 
autumn of 1776, was no longer able to hold the lower Hudson 
he retreated across New Jersey to the Delaware near Trenton and 
seizing every boat for miles up the river he placed his dispirited 
troops on the opposite side and left the pursuing army no means 
of crossing. With about 2500 men he recrossed the Delaware 
on the night of the 25th of December, surprised three regiments 
of Hessians at Trenton the next morning, and took 1000 prisoners 
and 1000 stands of arms. In a series of movements following 
up this success he outgeneraled the British commander, Lord 
Cornwallis, and on the 3rd of January 1776, defeated a detach- 
ment of his army at Princeton (q.v.). The American army then 
went into winter quarters at Morristown, while a part of the 
British army wintered at New Brunswick. To protect the 

	1 Greenwich then had some importance as a port on Cohansey 
	Creek on the lower Delaware. In the summer of 1774 the captain of 
	the ship " Greyhound," bound for Philadelphia with a cargo of tea, 
	on account of the state of opinion in that city, put in at Greenwich 
	and stored his tea there in a cellar. It remained undisturbed till 
	the ^night of the 22nd of November, when a band of about 40 men 
	dressed as Indians, in imitation of the Boston party, broke into the 
	cellar and made' a bonfire of the tea. All attempts to punish the 
	offenders were futile. 

inhabitants of the Raritan Valley from British foraging parties 
General Benjamin Lincoln with 500 men was by Washington's 
orders stationed at Bound Brook, but on the 13th of April 1777 
Lincoln was surprised by a force of about 4000 men under 
Cornwallis, and although he escaped with small loss it was only by 
remarkably rapid movements. When the British had gained 
possession of Philadelphia, in September 1777, their communica- 
tion between that city and the ocean through the Lower Delaware 
was obstructed on the New Jersey side by Fort Mercer, com- 
manded by Colonel Christopher Greene, at Red Bank; three 
battalions of Hessians under Colonel Karl Emil Kurt von Donop 
attacked the fort on the 22nd of October, but they were repulsed 
with heavy loss. The fort was abandoned later, however. As 
the British army under General Clinton was retreating, in June 
1778, from Philadelphia to New York, the American . army 
engaged it in the battle of Monmouth (June 28, 1778); the 
result was indecisive, but that the British were not badly defeated 
was ascribed to the conduct of General Charles Lee. Before 
daylight on the 19th of August 1779 was approaching, Major 
Henry Lee with a force of about 400 men surprised the British 
garrison at Paulus Hook, where Jersey City now stands, and, 
although sustaining a loss of 20 men, killed 50 of the garrison and 
took about 160 prisoners. In 17 79-1 780 Morristown was again 
Washington's headquarters. The Congress of the Confederation 
met in Princeton, in Nassau Hall, which still stands, from June 
to November 1783. 

After the war New Jersey found its commercial existence 
threatened by New York and Philadelphia, and it was a feeling of 
weakness from this cause rather than any lack of state pride 
that caused the state to join in the movements for a closer 
Federal Union. In 1786 New Jersey sent delegates to the 
Annapolis Convention, which was the forerunner of the Federal 
Convention at Philadelphia in the following year. In the latter 
body, on the 15th of June, one of the New Jersey delegates, 
William Paterson (1 745-1806), presented what was called the 
" New Jersey plan " of union, representing the wishes of the 
smaller states, which objected to representation in a national 
Congress being based on wealth or on population ., This merely 
federal plan, reported from a Conference attended by the delegates 
from Connecticut, New York and Delaware, as well as those 
from New Jersey (and by Luther Martin of Maryland), consisted 
of nine resolutions; the first was that " the Articles of Confedera- 
tion ought to be so revised, corrected antf enlarged as to render 
the federal Constitution adequate to the exigencies of govern- 
ment and the preservation of the Union "; and the actual 
" plan " was for a single legislative body, in which each state 
should be represented by one member, and which should elect 
the* supreme court and have power to remove the executive 
(a Council), to lay taxes and import duties, to control commerce, 
and even, if necessary, to make requisitions for funds from the 
states. Madison opposed the plan, on the ground that it would 
not prevent violations by the states of treaties and of laws 
of nations. On the first resolution only there was a definite 
vote; on the 19th of June it was voted to postpone the considera- 
tion of this resolution and to report the resolutions (the Virginia 
plan) formerly agreed upon by the committee of the whole. 
The New Jersey plan left its impress in the provision of the 
Constitution (approved in the Convention on the 7th of July) 
for equal representation in the national Senate. The Federal 
Constitution was ratified by a unanimous vote in the state 
convention which met at Trenton on the 18th of December 
1787. 

The state's own constitution, which had been adopted in 
1776 and amended in 1777, retained, like other state constitu- 
tions framed during the War of Independence t many features 
of colonial government ill-adapted to a state increasingly demo- 
cratic. The basis of representation, each county electing three 
members to the assembly and one member to the legislative 
council, soon became antiquated. The property qualifications 
were, for members of the council, " one thousand pounds pro- 
clamation money, of real and personal estate, in the same 
county," and, for members of the assembly, " five hundred 
pounds proclamation money, in real and personal estate, in the 
same county." These and the property qualifications for suffrage, 
which was granted to " all inhabitants of this state, of full age, 
who are worth fifty pounds proclamation money, clear estate in 
the same," &c, were soon considered undemocratic; and the 
democratic tendency of certain election officers may be seen from 
their construing the words " all inhabitants of full age " to in- 
clude women, and from their permitting women to vote. The 
governor was chosen by the joint vote of the council and assembly; 
he was president of the council, with a casting vote; he was 
chancellor, captain-general and commander-in-chief of the 
militia; he had three members of the legislature to act as a 
privy-council; and he, with the council (of which seven formed 
a quorum), constituted " the Court of Appeals in the last resort 
in all causes of law, as heretofore," which, in addition, had " the 
power of granting pardons to criminals, after condemnation, in 
all cases of treason, felony or other offences." 

In 1838 the opposition to the governor's extensive powers under 
the constitution was greatly increased in the ** Broad Seal " or 
" Great Seal " War. After a closely contested election in which six 
members of Congress were chosen on a general ticket, although there 
was an apparent Democratic majority of about one hundred votes 
(in a total of 57,000), two county clerks rejected as irregular sufficient 
returns from townships to elect five Whig candidates to whom the 
state board of canvassers (mostly Whigs and headed by the Whig 
governor, William Pennington) gave commissions under the broad 
seal of the state. Excluding these five members from New Jersey 
the House of Representatives contained 119 Democrats and 118 
Whigs, so that the choice of a Whig speaker could be secured only 
by the seating^ of the five Whigs from New Jersey rather than their 
Democratic rivals. It was decided that only members whose 
seats were not contested should vote for speaker, and Robert M. T. 
Hunter, of Virginia, a. Democrat and a compromise candidate, was 
elected to the position; and on the 28th of t February 1839 the 
Democratic candidates were admitted to their seats, to which a 
congressional committee, reporting afterwards, declared them 
entitled. 1 

Agitation for constitutional reform resulted in a constitutional 
convention, which met at Trenton from the 14th of May to the 
29th of June 1844 and drafted a new frame of government, 
introducing a number of radical changes. This instrument was 
ratified at the polls on the 13th of August. The election of the 
governor was taken from the legislature and given to the people; 
the powers of government were distributed among legislative, 
executi ve and judicial departments ; representation in the 
assembly was based on population; and the property qualifica- 
tion for membership in the legislature and for the suffrage was 
abolished. 

The constitution of 1844 declared that " All men are by nature 
free and independent, and have certain unalienable rights, among 
which are those of enjoying and defending life and liberty . . . and 
of pursuing and obtaining safety and happiness." A similar clause 
in the constitution of Massachusetts had been interpreted by the 
courts as an abolition of#slavery, and an effort was made to have 
the same ruling applied in New Jersey, where the institution of 
slavery still existed. The courts, however, declared that the clause 
in the constitution of New Jersey was a " general proposition," not 
applying " to man in his private, industrial or domestic capacity." 
An attempt at abolition had previously been made in 1804 by an 
act declaring that every child born of a slave should be free, but 
should remain the servant of its mother's owner until twenty-five 
years of age if a male or twenty-one years of age if a female. The 
owner of the mother, however, might abandon the child after a 
year, and it then became a public charge. This last provision pro- 
duced such a heavy drain on the treasury for the support of abandoned 
negro children that in 1811 the statute was repealed. In 1846 an 
act was passed designating slaves as apprentices bound to service 
until discharged by their owners, and providing that children of

	Declaration of Independence, created hardly less excitement than 
	the Broad Seal War. The state legislature which elected him

	his own vote carrying the motion; but, because of the objection of 
	Charles Sumner, he withdrew his vote on the 27th of March, and 
	was thereupon unseated by a vote of 23 to 21. 

such apprentices should be free at birth, but were to be supported 
by the masters of their parents for six years. There were conse- 
quently a few vestiges of the slavery system in New Jersey until 
the adoption of the Thirteenth Amendment to the Federal Con- 
stitution. 

Toward the political questions that disturbed the American 
people immediately before the Civil War the attitude of the state 
was conservative. In 1852 the Free-soil candidate for the pre- 
sidency received only 350 votes in New Jersey; and in 1856 the 
Democratic candidate received a plurality of 18,605 votes, even 
though William L. Dayton, a citizen of the state, was the Repub- 
lican nominee for the vice-presidency. In i860 three of the 
state's electoral votes were given to Douglas and four .to Lincoln. 
During the Civil War New Jersey furnished 89,305 men for the 
Union cause and incurred extraordinary expenditures to the 
amount of $2,894,385. The state readily consented to the 
Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Federal Con- 
stitution, but in 1868 withdrew its consent to the latter. The 
Fifteenth Amendment was rejected by one legislature, but was 
accepted by its successor, in which the Republican party had 
obtained a majority. 

Industrially the early part of the 19th century was marked 
in New Jersey by the construction of bridges and turnpikes, 
the utilization of water power for manufactures, and the intro- 
duction of steam motive power upon the navigable waters. The 
second war with England interrupted this material progress, 
and at its beginning was so unpopular, especially with the 
Quakers, that the Federalists carried the elections in the autumn 
of 181 2. But the attempt of this party to retain control by a 
" gerrymandering " process was unsuccessful. The Democrats 
were triumphant in 181 3, and the Federalist as well as the 
Democratic administration responded with aid for the defence of 
New York and Philadelphia. The state also contributed several 
hundred men to the service of the United States. Material 
progress in New Jersey after the war is indicated by the con- 
struction of the Morris (1824-1836) and the Delaware & Raritan 
(1826-1838) canals, and the completion of its first railway, 
the Camden & Amboy, in 1834. 

The years following the Civil War were marked by great in- 
dustrial development. The numerous projects, good and bad, 
that were inaugurated in 1866-187 5, and the various kinds of 
laws and charters conferring special privileges that were secured, 
led to the constitutional prohibition of special legislation already 
mentioned. In this same period there was a bitter railway war. 
The Delaware & Raritan Canal Company and the Camden & 
Amboy Railroad Company, both chartered in 1830 and both 
monopolies, 1 had been practically consolidated in 1831; in 1836 
these joint companies gained control of the Philadelphia & 
Trenton railway; in 1867 these " United New Jersey Railroad 
& Canal Companies " consolidated with the New Jersey 
Railroad & Transportation Company (which was opened in 
1836 and controlled the important railway link between New 
Brunswick and Jersey City), and profits were to be divided 
equally between the four companies; and in 1871 these entire 
properties were leased for 999 years to the Pennsylvania Railroad 
Company. This combination threatened to monopolize traffic, 
and it was opposed by the Central Railroad of New Jersey, 
the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western, and a branch of the 
North Pennsylvania (from Jenkintown to Yardley; sometimes 
called the " national " or " air-line "), and by the general public; 
and in 1873 the state passed a general railway law giving other 
railways than the United New Jersey holdings of the Penn- 

	1 In 1864 a bill was introduced in [the Federal House of Repre- 
	sentatives making the Camden & Atlantic (now the Atlantic City) 
	railway and the Raritan & Delaware Bay (now a part of the Central 
	of New Jersey) a post route between New York and Philadelphia 
	and authorizing these railways to carry passengers and freight 
	between New York and Philadelphia. Thereupon the governor and 
	legislature of New Jersey protested that such a measure was an 
	infringement of the reserved rights of the state, since the state had 
	contracted with the Camden & Amboy not to construct nor to 
	authorize others to construct within a specified time any other 
	railway across the state to be used for carrying passengers or freight 
	between New York and Philadelphia.

sylvania the right to connect New York and Philadelphia. In 
1876 the "national" line was extended to Bound Brook (as 
the Delaware & Bound Brook) and this road, the North Penn- 
sylvania & Central Railroad of New Jersey, were operated under 
a tripartite agreement as a through line between New York 
and Philadelphia; but in 1879 these three lines were leased for 
990 years to the Philadelphia & Reading railway. The state 
itself then became engaged in a struggle with the railways in 
order to secure from them their full portion of taxes, as the 
property of individuals was then taxed many times as heavily 
as that of railways. In 1884 the state gained the victory by 
securing the passage of a law taxing the franchises of railway 
corporations. 

A reform movement in politics, caHed the " New Idea," 
and led by Everett Colby (b. 1874), then a Repubtican member 
of the Assembly and in 1 906-1908 a state senator, began in 1904; 
it did much to secure the passage of acts limiting public service 
franchises to 20 years (unless extended to 40 years by the voters 
of the municipality concerned), the increase of taxes on railways, 
the increase of franchise tax rates by 1 J % each year up to 5 %, 
the adoption of direct primary elections, and the modification of 
the existing promoters' liability law. 

Before 1S00 the state was dominated by the Federalist party; 
from that date until 1 896 it was generally controlled by the Demo- 
crats, and from 1896 to 1911 by the Republicans.

NEW JERUSALEM CHURCH, or New Church, the com- 
munity founded by the followers of Emmanuel Swedenborg 
(q.v.). Swedenborg himself took no steps to found a church, but 
having given a new interpretation of Scripture, it was inevitable 
that those who accepted his doctrine should separate themselves 
and organize a society in accordance therewith. Those who 
received them fully during Swedenborg's lifetime were few 
and scattered, but courageously undertook the task of dissemina- 
tion, and gave* themselves to translating and distributing their 
master's writings. Two Anglican clergymen were conspicuous 
in this work: Thomas Hartley (d. 1784), rector of Winwick, and 
John Clowes (1 743-1831), vicar of St John's, Manchester. 
Hartley translated Heaven and Hell (1778) and True Christian 
Religion (1781); Clowes, who taught New Church doctrine 
in the existing churches and was opposed to the forming of new 
organizations, translated 1 7 volumes, including the A rcana 
Coelestia, and published over 50 volumes of exposition and 
defence. Through his influence Lancashire became the strong- 
hold of the Swedenborgians, and to-day includes a third of the 
congregations and more than half the members of the New 
Church in the United Kingdom. 

In 1782 a society for publishing Swedenborg's writings was 
formed in Manchester, and in December 1783 a little company 
of sympathizers with similar aims met in London and founded 
" The Theosophical Society," among the members of which 
were John Flaxman the sculptor, William Sharpe the engraver, 
and F. H. Barthelemon the composer. In the early days most of 
them worshipped at the Female Orphan Asylum, St George's, 
whose chaplain, Rev. Jacob Duche, like Clowes at Manchester, 
preached the doctrines from his own pulpit. In 1785 and 1787 
J. W. Salmon and R. Mather conducted an open-air missionary 
tour in the Midlands and the North with some success. Five 
prominent Wcsleyan preachers adopted the new teaching and 
were cut off from their connexion, a step which led, in spite of 
remonstrance from Clowes and others, to the formal organization 
of the New Jerusalem Church on the 7th of May 1787. For some 
months the members met in private nouses, hut in January 1788 
began worship in a church in Great Eastcheap with a liturgy 
specially prepared by the Rev. James Hindmarsh and Isaac 
Hawkins. " The Theosophical Society " was now dissolved. 
In April 1789 a General Conference of British Swedenborgians 
was held in Great Eastcheap Church, followed by another and 
by the publication of a journal, the New Jerusalem Magazine^ 
in 1790. Since 1815 conferences have been held every year. 
A weekly paper, the Morning Light, is published, as well as 
monthly magazines for adults (the New Church Magazine) and 
young folk. The liturgy (containing five services for Morning 
and Evening, together with the order of Baptism, Holy 
Supper, Marriage, &c.) was prepared in 1828, revised and ex- 
tended in 1875; the hymn book of 1823 was revised and 
enlarged in 1880. 

In the provinces the first church was at Birmingham (1791), 
followed by one at Manchester and another at Liverpool (1793)- 
The Accrington church, the largest in Great Britain, was founded 
in 1802. Many of the early converts to the New Church were 
among the most fervent advocates of the abolition of slavery, 
one was the medical officer of the first batch of convicts sent to 
Botany Bay; from the house of another, William Cookworthy 
of Plymouth, Captain Cook sailed on his last voyage. Others 
were pioneers of elementary education, establishing free day 
schools long before they were thought of by the state. 

In 1815 the conference took up the question of home missionary 
work, and its agents were able to found many branches of the 
church. In 1813 the Manchester and Salford (now the North of 
England) Missionary Society was founded, chiefly to provide 
preachers for the smaller churches in its area; in 1857 a National 
Missionary Institution was founded and endowed, to which 
most of the local ones have been affiliated. Other denominational 
agencies have been concerned with the printing and circulation 
of Swedenborgian literature, a training college for the ministry 
(founded in 1852), and a Ministers' Aid Fund (1854), and an 
Orphanage (1881). The centenary of the New Church as a 
spiritual system was celebrated in 1857, as an external organiza- 
tion in 1883. A few Swedenborgians still hold to the non- 
separating policy, but more from force of circumstances than from 
deliberate principle. The constitution of the New Church is of 
the Independent i Congregational type; the conference may 
advise and counsel, but cannot compel the obedience of the 
societies. The returns for 1909 showed 45 ministers, 8 recog- 
nized leaders, 10 recognized missionaries, 70 societies, 6665 
registered members, 7907 Sunday scholars. There are also five 
or six small societies not connected with the conference. 

The New Church in Europe, — In Sweden the Philanthropic 
Exegetic Society was formed by C. F. Nordenskiold in 1786 to 
collect documents about Swedenborg and to publish his writings. 
The introduction of alchemy and mesmerism led to its dissolution 
in 1789, but its work was continued by the society " Pro fide et 
chantate," which existed from 1796 to 1820. For many years the 
works of Swedenborg and his followers were proscribed, and receivers 
of his writings fined or deprived of office, but in 1866, when religious 
liberty had made progress, the cause was again taken up; in 1875 
the society of " Confessors of the New Church " was formed in 
Stockholm, and since 1877 services have been regularly held. There 
is also a church in Gothenburg, and lectures are given from time to 
time in most of the towns of Sweden. In Norway there is no New 
Church organization; in Denmark a church was founded in Copen- 
hagen in 1871. In Germany Prelate Oetinger of Wurttemberg 
translated many of Swedcnborg's writings between 1765 and 1786, 
but the great name is that of Immanuel Tafel (d. 1863), librarian of 
Tubingen, who not only edited, translated and published, but in 
1848 founded a " Union of the New Church in Germany and Switzer- 
land " which held quarterly meetings. There is a church in Berlin, 
but otherwise activity in Germany has taken shape in the German 
Swedenborg Society with headquarters at Stuttgart. In Switzerland, 
on the contrary, there is an organized body of the New Church; 
divine service being held in the Society at Zurich and by circles at 
Berne, Herisau and Nesslau. The Zurich pastor is a member of the 
American Convention, and has oversight also of the Austrian 
societies at Vienna and Trieste. In Hungary there are societies at 
Buda Pesth and Gyorkony. In France there were early Sweden- 
borgians of rank and learning, and much translation was accomplished 
before 1800. About 1838 J. F. E. Le Boys de Guays began his 
masterly translation of all Swedenborg's theological works and 
instituted public New Church worship, which was carried on at his 
house for thirty years. Sunday worship is now held in the New 
Church Temple on the Rue Thouin. In Italy (Rome), Holland 
(The Hague), Belgium (Antwerp and Bruges), there are small 
societies, and nearly every European country has some known 
adherents. 

In America, — About 1784 James Glen, a London Scot, delivered 
lectures " For the Sentimentalists " on the new doctrine in Phila- 
delphia and Boston and circulated some of Swedcnborg's works. 
Francis Bailey, state printer of Pennsylvania, was attracted by them 
and became active in their promulgation. During the next ten years 
a number of prominent men gave their support to the teaching, 
which gradually spread inland and southward. The first society for 
worship was formed in Baltimore in 1792 (reorganized 1798), though 
a short-lived one had preceded it at Halifax, N.S., in 1791. Other 
churches grew up in Philadelphia, Cincinnati, Boston and New 
York, and the General Convention, which meets annually, was 
formed at Philadelphia in 1817. In 1907 there were 102 ministers 
and 103 societies with a membership of 6560. Of these, 4 societies 
and 1^0 members are in Canada, while the German Synod counts for 
1 1 societies and 325 members. 

In Australia, &c. — The formation of societies in Australia began 
at Adelaide in 1844. Melbourne and Sydney followed in 1854, 
Brisbane in 1865, Rodborough, Vict., in 1878. There is a circle at 
Perth. New Zealand has a church at Auckland (1883) and scattered 
members in the south island. An Australasian conference met at 
Melbourne in 1881 and has continued to meet in alternate years. 
There is a society at Mauritius, and correspondents in various parts 
of South and West Africa, India, Japan, the West Indies and South 
America.

NEW KENSINGTON, a borough of Westmoreland county, 
Pennsylvania, U.S.A., on the Allegheny river, 18 m. N.E. of 
Pittsburg. Pop. (1900) 4665 (1042 foreign-born and 86 ne- 
groes); (1910) 7707. It is served by the Pennsylvania railroad 
and by electric railways to neighbouring towns. There are a 
variety of manufactures. The borough was founded in 1891 
and was incorporated in the following year. 


NEWLANDS, JOHN ALEXANDER REINA (1838-1898), 
English chemist, was born in 1838. He was one of the first, if 
not quite the first, to propound the conception of periodicity 
among the chemical elements. His earliest contribution to the 
question took the form of a letter published in the Chemical News 
in February 1863. In the succeeding year he showed, in the 
same journal, that if the elements be arranged in the order of their 
atomic weights, those having consecutive numbers frequently 
either belong to the same group or occupy similar positions in 
different groups, and he pointed out that each eighth element 
starting from a given one is in this arrangement a kind of re- 
petition of the first, like the eighth note of an octave in music. 
The Law of Octaves thus enunciated was at first ignored or 
treated with ridicule as a fantastic notion unworthy of serious 
consideration, but the idea, subsequently elaborated by D. I. 
Mendeleeff and other workers into the Periodic Law, has taken 
its place as one of the most important generalizations in modern 
chemical theory. Newlands, who was of Italian extraction on 
his mother's side, and fought as a volunteer in the cause of 
Italian freedom under Garibaldi in i860, died in London on the 
29th of July 1898. He collected his various papers on the 
atomicity of the elements in a little volume on the Discovery of 
the Periodic Law published in London in 1884. 


NEW LONDON, a city, port of entry, and one of the county- 
seats of New London county, Connecticut, U.S.A., coextensive 
with the township of New London, in the S.E. part of the state, 
on the Thames river, about 3 m. from its entrance into Long 
Island Sound. Pop. (1890) 13,7.57; ( 1 9<x>) 17,548, of whom 
3743 were foreign-born; (1910 census) 19,659. It is served 
by the New York, New Haven & Hartford, and the New London 
Northern (leased by the Central Vermont) railways, by electric 
railway to Norwich, Westerly, Groton, Stoning ton and East 
Lyme, by a daily line of passenger steamboats to New York City, 
and by two lines of freight steamers, and in the summer months 
by daily steamboats to Sag Harbor and Grcenport, Long Island, 
and Watch Hill and Block Island, Rhode Island. New London's 
harbour is the best on the Sound. The city is the headquarters of 
a United States artillery district, embracing Fort H. G. Wright 
on Fisher's Island, New York, Fort Michie on Gull Island, New 
York, Fort Terry on Plum Island, New York, and Fort Mansfield 
on Napatree Point, Rhode Island — fortifications which command 
tho eastern entrance to Long Island Sound; and it is the head- 
quarters of the Third District of the U.S. Engineers and of the 
Third District of the Lighthouse Department. The harbour was 
formerly defended by two forts, both now obsolete — Fort 
Trumbull on the right bank of the Thames, and Fort Griswold 
on the left bank, in the township of Groton (pop. 1900, 5962). 
The city is built on a declivity facing the south-east; from the 
higher points there are excellent views of Long Island Sound 
and the surrounding country. New London is a summer resort, 
and is a station of the New York Yacht Club; the boat races 
between Harvard and Yale universities are annually rowed on 
the river near the city. Among the places of interest are the 
Town Mill, built in 1650 by John Winthrop, Jr., in co-operation 
with the town; the Hempstead Mansion, built by John Hemp- 
stead about 1678; the old cemetery, north-east of the city, laid 
out in 1653; a school house in which Nathan Hale taught; and 
a court house built in 1785. There is a public library (about 
30,000 volumes), and the New London County Historical Society 
(incorporated 1870) has an historical library. There are two 
endowed high schools, the Bulkeley School for boys and the 
Williams Memorial Institute (1891) for girls, and an endowed 
Manual Training and Industrial School (1872), all offering free 
instruction. In the 18th century New London had a large trade 
in lumber, flour and food supplies with the West Indies, Gibraltar 
and the Barbary States; but this trade declined after the War of 
1812, and the whaling and sealing industries, once very lucrative, 
have also declined in value. The imports in 1906 were valued 
at $54,873 and the exports at $60,522; in 1909 their respective 
values were $10,870 and $10,295. Manufacturing is the principal 
industry; among the products are silk goods, cotton gins, 
printing presses and foundry and machine shop products. The 
total value of factory products was $4,709,628 in 1905, an increase 
of 11 -6% since 1900. 

New London was founded in 1646 by John Winthrop, the 
younger. It was known by its Indian name " Nameaug " until 
1658, when the General Court of Connecticut approved the 
wish of the settlers to adopt its present name from London, 
England, the river Monhegin at the same time becoming the 
Thames. During the War of Independence it was a rendezvous 
for American privateers. In 1776 the first naval expedition 
authorized by Congress was organized in its harbour, and there 
in the next three years twenty privateers were fitted out. On 
the 6th of September 1781, 800 British troops and Loyalists under 
General Benedict Arnold (who was born in New London county) 
raided New London, destroyed much private property, and at 
Fort Griswold killed 84 American soldiers, many of them after 
their surrender. The massacre is commemorated by an obelisk, 
134 ft. high, on Groton Heights. The city was incorporated in 
1784. In 1798 there was an epidemic of yellow fever. From 
the 7th of November 1812 until the close of the second war 
with Great Britain the harbour was blockaded by a British 
fleet.

NEWLYN, a village in the St Ives parliamentary division of 
Cornwall, England, on the shore of Mount's Bay, 1 m. S.W. of 
Penzance. It is a small fishing port, with narrow paved lanes 
and old-fashioned cottages. Near the parish church of St Peter 
stands an ancient cross of granite, discovered in a field close by. 
The harbour, one of the safest for small craft in the west country, 
is sheltered by two long and massive stone piers. A more 
ancient pier, originally constructed in the reign of Henry VI., 
was renewed in that of James I. Tin mining and smelting have 
been largely carried on in the neighbourhood, and several galleries 
were worked far under the sea. The principal modern industry, 
however, is fishing, especially for pilchard. The picturesque 
appearance of the village, with its quays and little harbour, and 
the grandeur of the cliffs and moorland scenery towards Land's 
End, make Newlyn an attractive spot. Between 1880 and 1890 
an artistic coterie grew up here, the leaders of which were Edwin 
Harris, Walter Langley, Fred Hall, Frank Bramley, T. C. Gotch, 
Mr and Mrs Stanhope Forbes, Chevalier Taylor and H. S. Tuke. 
The earlier artists at Newlyn were said to have selected it as their 
centre, because a greyness in the atmosphere helped their 
depiction of subtleties in tone, part of their creed being subordina- 
tion of colour to tone-gradation. In later times, the element 
of a common ideal tended to disappear, but the interest of the 
" Newlyn school " attracted a regular art-colony, who in various 
ways assimilated and expressed the picturesque influences of 
the place (see Painting: Recent British), There is a permanent 
Art Gallery, containing examples of the work of the Newlyn 
artists. Newlyn ward in the urban district of Paul (pop. 6332) 
had in 1901 a population of 3749. 


NEW MADRID, a city and the county-seat of New Madrid 
county, Missouri, U.S.A., on the right bank of the Mississippi 
river, about 35 m. S. by W. of Cairo, 111. Pop. (1900) 1489; 
(19 10) 1882. It is served by the St Louis South-western railway 
and by river packets. The city is a shipping point for a rich 
grain, cotton, livestock and lumber region. Among its manu- 
factures are lumber, staves, and hoops. The municipality owns 
its water-works. Owing to the encroachments of the Mississippi 
river, the site of the first permanent settlement of New Madrid is 
said to lie now about i| m. from the E. bank of the river, in 
Kentucky. This settlement was made in 1788, on an elaborately 
laid out town site, and was named New Madrid by its founder, 
Colonel George Morgan (1742-1810), 1 who, late in 1787, had 
received a grant of a large tract of land on the right bank of the 
Mississippi river, below the mouth of the Ohio, from Don Diego 
de Gardoqui, Spanish minister to the United States. The tract 
lay within the province of " Louisiana," and the grant to Morgan 
was a part of Gardoqui's plan to annex to that province the 
western American settlements, Morgan being required to estab- 
lish thereon a large number of emigrants, whom he secured from 
New Jersey, Canada and elsewhere. Governoi Estevan Miro 
of Louisiana, however, disapproved of the grant, on the ground 
that it would cause the province to be overrun by Americans; 
the settlers became restive under the restraints imposed upon 
them; Morgan himself left; and in December 1811 and January 
181 2 a series of severe earthquake shocks caused a general 
emigration. New Madrid was occupied by Confederate troops 
under General Gideon J. Pillow, on the 28th of July 1861, and 
after the surrender of Fort Donelson (February 16, 1862) the 
troops previously at Columbus, forming the Confederate left flank, 
were withdrawn to New Madrid and Island No. 10 (in the 
Mississippi about 10 m. S.). There were Confederate batteries on 
the left bank of the Mississippi opposite Island No. 10, and along 
the same bank from a point opposite New Madrid to Tiptonville, 
Tennessee. Behind these batteries were Reelfoot Lake and over- 
flowed lands. Retreat bv land was thus virtually impossible. 
Early in March, Major-General John Pope and Commodore A.H. 
Foote proceeded against these positions; New Madrid, then in 
command of General John P. McGown, was evacuated on the 
14th; (Admiral) Henry Walke (1808- 1896), commanding the 
" Carondelet," ran past the batteries of Island No. 10 and the 
shore batteries on the 4th of April, and Lieut.-Commander 
Egbert Thompson, commanding the " Pittsburgh," on the 7th; 
meanwhile the Federals under the direction of Colonel Josiah W. 
Bissell (b. 1818), of the engineer corps, had, with great difficulty, 
constructed an artificial channel to New Madrid across the 
peninsula (swamp land) formed by a great loop of the Mississippi ; 
troops were conveyed by transports through this channel below 
the island, Federal batteries having been established on the right 
bank of the river; the retreat of the Confederates down stream 
was effectually blocked; they evacuated the island on April 
7th, and on the 8th the garrison and the forces stationed in the 
shore batteries, a total of about 7000, under General W. W. 
Mackall (who had succeeded General McGown on the 31st of 
March) was surrendered at Tiptonville. The island was sub- 
sequently washed away, a new one being formed in the vicinity. 
NEWMAN, FRANCIS WILLIAM (1805-1897), English scholar 
and miscellaneous writer, younger brother of Cardinal Newman, 
was born in London on the 27th of June 1805. Like his brother, 
he was educated at Ealing, and subsequently at Oxford, where 
he had a brilliant career, obtaining a double first class in 1826. 
He was elected fellow of Balliol in the same year. Conscientious 
scruples respecting the ceremony of infant baptism led him to 
resign his fellowship in 1830, and he went to Baghdad as assistant 
in the mission of the Rev. A. N. Groves. In 1833 he returned to 
England to procure additional support for the mission, but 
rumours of unsoundness in his views on the doctrine of eternal 
punishment had preceded him, and finding himself generally 
looked upon with suspicion, he gave up the vocation of missionary 
to become classical tutor in an unsectarian college at Bristol. 
His letters written home during the period of his mission were 
collected and published in 1856, and form an interesting little 
volume. Newman's views matured rapidly, and in 1840 he 
became professor of Latin in Manchester New College, the 
celebrated Unitarian seminary long established at York, and 
the parent of Manchester College, Oxford. In 1846 he quitted 
this appointment to become professor in University College, 
London, where he remained until 1869. During all this period 

	1 Morgan had been made Indian agent at Fort Pitt (Pittsburg) 
	in 1776, and was commissioned a colonel in the Continental Army 
	in 1777. In 1806 he was visited at his home, near Pittsburg, bjj 
	Aaron Burr, who told him something about his famous " conspiracy 
	scheme in the West, which Morgan reported to Jefferson — " the very 
	first intimation I had of the plot," Jefferson afterward wrote to 
	Morgan. 

he was assiduously carrying on his studies in mathematics and 
oriental languages, but wrote little until 1847, when he published 
anonymously a History of the Hebrew Monarchy, intended to 
introduce the results of German investigation in this department 
of Biblical criticism. In 1849 appeared The Soul, her Sorrows 
and Aspirations, and in 1850, Phases of Faith, or Passages from 
the History of my Creed — the former a tender but searching 
analysis of the relations of the spirit of man with the Creator; 
the latter a religious autobiography detailing the author's passage 
from Calvinism to pure theism. It is on these two books that 
Professor Newman's celebrity will principally rest; having in 
both to describe his personal experience, his intense earnestness 
has kept him free from the eccentricity which marred most of his 
other writings, excepting his contributions to mathematical 
research and oriental philology. There was, indeed, scarcely 
a crotchet, except " spiritualism," of which he was not at one 
time or another the advocate. His versatility was amazing: he 
wrote on logic, political economy, English reforms, Austrian 
politics, Roman history, diet, grammar, the most abstruse 
departments of mathematics, Arabic, the emendation of Greek 
texts, and languages as out of the way as the Berber and as 
obsolete as the dialect of the Iguvine inscriptions. In treating all 
these subjects he showed signal ability, but, wherever the theme 
allowed, an incurable crotchet iness; and in his numerous metrical 
translations from the classics, especially his version of the Iliad , 
he betrayed an insensibility to the ridiculous which would almost 
have justified the irreverent criticism of Matthew Arnold, had 
this been conveyed in more seemly fashion. His miscellaneous 
essays, some of much value, were collected in several volumes 
before his death: his last publication, Contributions chiefly to 
the Early History of Cardinal Newman (1891), was generally 
condemned as deficient in fraternal feeling. He was far from 
possessing his brother's subtlety of reasoning, but he impresses 
by a transparent sincerity and singleness of mind not always dis- 
played by the more celebrated writer; his style is too individual 
to be taken as a model, but is admirable for its simplicity and 
clearness. His character is vividly drawn by Carlyle in his life 
of Sterling, of whose son Newman was guardian: "a man of 
fine attainments, of the sharpest-cutting and most restlessly 
advancing intellect and of the mildest pious enthusiasm." 
It was his great misfortune that this enthusiasm should have been 
correlated, as is not unfrequently the case, with an entire in- 
sensibility to the humorous side of things. After his retirement 
from University College, Professor Newman continued to live 
for some years in London, subsequently removing to Clifton, and 
eventually to Weston-super-Mare, where he died on the 7th of 
October 1897. He had been blind for five years before his death, 
but retained his faculties to the last. He was twice married.

(1909). (R. G.) 


NEWMAN, JOHN HENRY (1801-1890), English Cardinal, 
was born in London on the 21st of February 1801, the eldest 
son of John Newman, banker, of the firm of Ramsbottom, 
Newman and Co. The family was understood to be of Dutch 
extraction, and the name itself, spelt " Newmann " in an earlier 
generation, further suggests Hebrew origin. His mother, 
Jemima Fourdrinier, was of a Huguenot family, long established 
in London as engravers and paper manufacturers. John Henry 
was the eldest of six children. The second son, Charles Robert, 
a man of ability but of impracticable temper, a professed atheist 
and a recluse, died in 1884. The youngest son, Francis William 
(q.v.) t was for many years professor of Latin in University College, 
London. Two of the three daughters, Harriett Elizabeth and 
Jemima Charlotte, married brothers, Thomas and John Mozley; 
and Anne Mozley, a daughter of the latter, edited in 1892 New- 
man's Anglican Life and Correspondence, having been entrusted 
by him in 1885 with an autobiography written in the third 
person to form the basis of a narrative of the first thirty years 
of his life. The third daughter, Mary Sophia, died unmarried in 
1828. 

At the age of seven Newman was sent to a private school 
conducted by Dr Nicholas at Ealing, where he was distinguished 
by diligence and good conduct, as also by a certain shyness and 
aloofness, taking no part in the school games. He speaks of 
himself as having been " very superstitious "in these early years. 
He took great delight in reading the Bible, and also the novels 
of Scott, then in course of publication. At the age of fifteen, 
during his last year at school, he was " converted," an incident 
that throughout life remained to him " more certain than that 
he had hands or feet." It was in the autumn of 18 16 that he 
thus fell under the influence of a definite creed, and received 
into his intellect impressions of dogma never afterwards effaced. 
The tone of his mind was at this date evangelical and Calvinistic, 
and he held that the pope was anti-Christ. Matriculating at 
Trinity College, Oxford, 14th December 1816, he went into 
residence there in June the following year, and m 1818 he gained 
a scholarship of £60, tenable for nine years. But for this he 
would have been unable to remain at the university, as in 1819 
his father's bank suspended payment. In that year his name 
was entered at Lincoln's Inn. Anxiety to do well in the final 
schools produced the opposite result; he broke down in the 
examination, and so graduated with third-class honours in 1821. 
Desiring to remain in Oxford, he took private pupils and read for 
a fellowship at Oriel, then " the acknowledged centre of Oxford 
intellectuah'sm." To his intense relief and delight he was 
elected on the 12th of April 1822. E. B. Pusey was elected a 
fellow of the same society in 1823. 

On Trinity Sunday, 13th June 1824, Newman was ordained, 
and became, at Pusey's suggestion, curate of St Clement's, 
Oxford. Here for two years he was busily engaged in parochial 
work, but he found time to write articles on " Apollonius of 
Tyana," on " Cicero " and on " Miracles " for the Encyclopaedia 
Metropolitana. In 1825, at Whately's request, he became 
vice-principal of St Alban's Hall, but this post he held for one 
year only. To his association with Whately at this time he 
attributed much of his " mental improvement " and a partial 
conquest of his shyness. He assisted Whately in his popular 
work on logic, and from him he gained his first definite idea of 
the Christian Church. He broke with him in 1827 on the occasion 
of the re-election of Peel for the University, Newman opposing 
this on personal grounds. In 1826 he became tutor of Oriel, 
and the same year R. H. Froude, described by Newman as " one 
of the acutest, cleverest and deepest men " he ever met, was 
elected fellow. The two formed a high ideal of the tutorial office 
as clerical and pastoral rather than secular. In 1827 he was a 
preacher at Whitehall. The year following Newman supported 
and secured the election of Hawkins as provost of Oriel in pre- 
ference to Keble, a choice which he later defended or apologized 
for as having in effect produced the Oxford Movement with all 
its consequences. In the same year he was appointed vicar of 
St Mary's, to which the chapclry of Littlemore was attached, and 
Pusey was made regius professor of Hebrew. At this date, 
though still nominally associated with the Evangelicals, 
Newman's views were gradually assuming a higher ecclesiastical 
tone, and while local secretary of the Church Missionary Society 
he circulated an anonymous letter suggesting a method by which 
Churchmen might practically oust Nonconformists from all 
control of the society. This resulted in his being dismissed from 
the post, 8th March 1830; and three months later he withdrew 
from the Bible Society, thus completing his severance from the 
Low Church party. In 1831-1832 he was select preacher before 
the University. In 1832, his difference with Hawkins as to the 
" substantially religious nature " of a college tutorship becoming 
acute, he resigned that post, and in December went with R. H. 
Froude, on account of the latter's health, for a tour in South 
Europe. On board the mail steamship " Hermes " they visited 
Gibraltar, Malta and the Ionian Islands, and subsequently 
Sicily, Naples and Rome, where Newman made the acquaintance 
of Dr Wiseman. In a letter home he described Rome as " the 
most wonderful place on earth," but the Roman Catholic religion 
as " polytheistic, degrading and idolatrous." It was during the 
course of this tour that he wrote most of the short poems which 
a year later were printed in the Lyra Apostolica. From Rome 
Newman returned to Sicily alone, and was dangerously ill with 
fever at Leonforte, recovering from it with the conviction that he 
had a work to do in England. 

In June 1833 he left Palermo for Marseilles in an orange boat, 
which was becalmed in the Strait of Bonifacio, and here he wrote 
the verses, " Lead, kindly Light," which later became popular as 
a hymn. He was at home again in Oxford on the oth of July, 
and on the 14th Keble preached at St Mary's an assize 
sermon on " National Apostasy/' which Newman afterwards 
regarded as the inauguration of the Oxford Movement. In the 
words of Dean Church, it was " Keble who inspired, Froude 
who gave the impetus and Newman who took up the work "; 
but the first organization of it was due to H. J. Rose, editor of the 
British Magazine, who has been styled " the Cambridge originator 
of the Oxford Movement." It was in his rectory house at Had- 
leigh, Suffolk, that a meeting of High Church clergymen was held, 
25th to 29th of July (Newman was not present), at which it was 
resolved to fight for " the apostolical succession and the integrity 
of the Prayer-Book." A few weeks later Newman started, 
apparently on his own initiative, the Tracts for the Times, from 
which the movement was subsequently named " Tractarian." 
Its aim was to secure for the Church of England a definite basis 
of doctrine and discipline, in case either of disestablishment or 
of a determination of High Churchmen to quit the establishment, 
an eventuality that was thought not impossible in view of the 
States' recent high-handed dealings with the sister established 
Church of Ireland. The teaching of the tracts was supplemented 
by Newman's Sunday afternoon sermons at St Mary's, the 
influence of which, especially over the junior members of the 
university, was increasingly marked during a period of eight 
years. In 1835 Pusey joined the movement, which, so far as 
concerned ritual observances, was later called " Puseyite "; 
and in 1836 its supporters secured further coherence by their 
united opposition to the appointment of Hampden as regius 
professor of divinity. His Bampton Lectures (in the preparation 
of which Blanco White had assisted him) were suspected of heresy, 
and this suspicion was accentuated by a pamphlet put forth by 
Newman, Elucidations of Dr Hampden's Theological Statements. 
At this date Newman became editor of the British Critic, and 
he also gave courses of lectures in a side-chapel of St Mary's 
in defence of the via media of the Anglican Church as between 
Romanism and popular Protestantism. His influence in Oxford 
was supreme about the year 1839, when, however, his study of 
the monophysite heresy first raised in his mind a doubt as to 
whether the Anglican position was really tenable on those prin- 
ciples of ecclesiastical authority which he had accepted; and 
this doubt returned when he read, in Wiseman's article in the 
Dublin Review on " The Anglican Claim," the words of St 
Augustine against the Donatists, " securus judicat orbis ter- 
rarum" words which suggested a simpler authoritative rule than 
that of the teaching of antiquity. He continued his work, 
however, as a High Anglican controversialist until he had 
published, in 1841, Tract go, the last of the series, in which he 
put forth, as a kind of proof charge, to test the tenability of all 
Catholic doctrine within the Church of England, a detailed 
examination of the XXXIX. Articles, suggesting that their 
negations were not directed against the authorized creed of 
Roman Catholics, but only against popular errors and exaggera- 
tions. This theory, though not altogether new, aroused much 
indignation in Oxford, and A. C. Tait, afterwards archbishop of 
Canterbury), with three other senior tutors, denounced it as 
" suggesting and opening a way by which men might violate 
their solemn engagements to the university." The alarm was 
shared by the heads of houses and by others in authority; and, 
at the request of the bishop of Oxford, the publication of the 
Tracts came to an end. At this date Newman also resigned the 
editorship of the British Critic, and was thenceforth, as he himself 
later described it, " on his deathbed as regards membership 
with the Anglican Church." He now recognized that the 
position of Anglicans was similar to that of the semi-Arians in 
the Arian controversy; and the arrangement made at this time 
that an Anglican bishopric should be established in Jerusalem, 
the appointment to lie alternately with the British and Prussian 
governments, was to him further evidence of the non-apostolical 
character of the Church of England. In 1842 he withdrew to 
Littlemore, and lived there under monastic conditions with a 
small band of followers, their life being one of great physical 
austerity as well as of anxiety and suspense. To his disciples 
there he assigned the task of writing lives of the English saints, 
while his own time was largely devoted to the completion of an 
essay on the development of Christian doctrine, by which principle 
he sought to reconcile himself to the elaborated creed and the 
practical system of the Roman Church. In February 1843 he 
published, as an advertisement in the Oxford Conservative Journal, 
an anonymous but otherwise formal retractation of all the hard 
things he had said against Rome; and in September, after the 
secession of one of the inmates of the house, he preached his last 
Anglican sermon at Littlemore and resigned the living of St 
Mary's. But still an interval of two years elapsed before he was 
formally received into the Roman Catholic Church (9th October 
1845) by Father Dominic, an Italian Passionist. In February 
1846 he left Oxford for Oscott, where Bishop Wiseman, then 
vicar-apostolic of the Midland district, resided; and in October 
he proceeded to Rome, where he was ordained priest and was 
given the degree of D.D. by the pope. At the close of 1847 he 
returned to England as an Oratorian, and resided first at Mary- 
vale (near Oscott); then at St Wilfrid's College, Cheadle; then 
at St Ann's, Alcester Street, Birmingham; and finally at Edg- 
baston, where spacious premises were built for the community, 
and where (except for four years in Ireland) he lived a secluded 
life for nearly forty years. Before the house at Edgbaston was 
occupied he had established the London Oratory, with Father 
Faber as its superior, and there (in King William Street, Strand) 
he delivered a course of lectures on " The Present Position of 
Catholics in England," in the fifth of which he protested against 
the anti-Catholic utterances of Dr Achilli, an ex-Dominican friar, 
whom he accused in detail of numerous acts of immorality. 
Popular Protestant feeling ran very high at the time, partly in 
consequence of the recent establishment of a Roman Catholic 
diocesan hierarchy by Pius IX., and criminal proceedings 
against Newman for libel resulted in an acknowledged gross 
miscarriage of justice. He was found guilty, and was sentenced 
to pay a fine of £ioo, while his expenses as defendant amounted 
to about £14,000, a sum that was at once raised by public 
subscription, a surplus being spent on the purchase of Rednall, 
a small property picturesquely situated on the Lickey Hills, 
with a chapel and cemetery, where Newman now lies buried. 
In 1854, at the request of the Irish bishops, Newman went to 
Dublin as rector of the newly-established Catholic university 
there. But practical organization was not among his gifts, and 
the bishops became jealous of his influence, so that after four 
years he retired, the best outcome of his stay there being a volume 
of lectures entitled Idea of a University, containing some of his 
most effective writing. In 1858 he projected a branch house 
of the Oratory at Oxford; but this was opposed by Manning and 
others, as likely to induce Catholics to send their sons to that 
university, and the scheme was abandoned. In 1859 he estab- 
lished, in connexion with the Birmingham Oratory, a school for 
the education of the sons of gentlemen on lines similar to those of 
the English public schools, an important work in which he never 
ceased to take the greatest interest. But all this time (since 
1841) Newman had been under a cloud, so far as concerned the 
great mass of cultivated Englishmen, and he was now awaiting 
an opportunity to vindicate his career; and in 1862 he began 
to prepare autobiographical and other memoranda for the 
purpose. The occasion came when, in January 1864, Charles 
Kingsley, reviewing Froude's History of England in Macmillan's 
Magazine, incidentally asserted that " Father Newman informs 
us that truth for its own sake need not be, and on the whole 
ought not to be, a virtue of the Roman clergy." After some 
preliminary sparring between the two^Newman's pamphlet, 
" Mr Kingsley and Dr Newman: a Correspondence on the Ques- 
tion whether Dr Newman teaches that Truth is no Virtue," 
published in 1864 and not reprinted, is unsurpassed in the English 
language for the vigour of its satire: the anger displayed was 
later, in a letter to Sir William Cope, admitted to have been 
largely feigned — Newman published in bi-monthly parts his 
Apologia pro vita sua, a religious autobiography of unsurpassed 
interest, the simple confidential tone of which " revolutionized 
the popular estimate of its author," establishing the strength and 
sincerity of the convictions which had led him into the Roman 
Catholic Church. Kingsky's accusation indeed, in so far as it 
concerned the Roman clergy generally, was not precisely dealt 
with; only a passing sentence, in an appendix on lying and 
equivocation, maintained that English Catholic priests are as 
truthful as English Catholic laymen; but of the author's own 
personal rectitude no room for doubt was left. 

In 1870 he put forth his Grammar of Assent, the most closely 
reasoned of his works, in which the case for religious belief is 
maintained by arguments differing somewhat from those com- 
monly used by Roman Catholic theologians; and in 1877, in 
the republication of his Anglican works, he added to the two 
volumes containing his defence of the via media a long preface 
and numerous notes in which he criticized and replied to sundry 
anti-Catholic arguments of his own in the original issues. At 
the time of the Vatican Council (1860-18 70) he was known 
to be opposed to the definition of Papal infallibility, and in a 
private letter to his bishop (Ullathorne), surreptitiously published, 
he denounced the " insolent and aggressive faction " that had 
pushed the matter forward. But he made no sign of disapproval 
when the doctrine was defined, and subsequently, in a letter 
nominally addressed to the duke of Norfolk on the occasion of 
Mr Gladstone's accusing the Roman Church of having " equally 
repudiated modern thought and ancient history, ,, Newman 
affirmed that he had always believed the doctrine, and had only 
feared the deterrent effect of its definition on conversions on 
account of acknowledged historical difficulties. In this letter, 
and especially in the postscript to the second edition of it, 
Newman finally silenced all cavillers as to his not being really 
at ease within the Roman Church. In 1878 his old college 
(Trinity), to his great delight, elected him an honorary fellow, 
and he revisited Oxford after an interval of thirty-two years. 
At the same date died Pope Pius IX., who had long mistrusted 
him; and Leo XIII. was encouraged by the duke of Norfolk 
and other distinguished Roman Catholic laymen to make 
Newman a cardinal, the distinction being a marked one, because 
he was a simple priest and not resident in Rome. The offer 
was made in February 1879, anc * tne announcement of it was 
received with universal applause throughout the English-speaking 
world. The "creation" took place on 12th May, with the 
title of St George in Velabro, Newman taking occasion while in 
Rome to insist on the lifelong consistency of his opposition to 
" liberalism in religion." After an illness that excited appre- 
hension he returned to England, and thenceforward resided at 
the Oratory until his death, nth August 1890, making occasional 
visits to London, and chiefly to his old friend, R. W. Church, 
dean of St Paul's, who as proctor had vetoed the condemnation 
of Tract go in 1841. As cardinal Newman published nothing 
beyond a preface to a work by A. \V. Hut ton on the Anglican 
Ministry (1879) and an article on Biblical criticism in the Nine- 
teenth' Century (February 1884). 

Newman's influence as controversialist and preacher {i.e. as 
reader of his written sermons, for he was never a speaker) was 
very great. For the Roman Church his conversion secured 
great prestige and the dissipation of many prejudices. Within it 
his influence was mainly in the direction of a broader spirit and 
of a recognition of the important part played by development 
both in doctrine and in Church government. And although he 
never called himself a mystic, he showed that in his judgment 
spiritual truth is apprehended by direct intuition, as an ante- 
cedent necessity to the professedly purely rational basis of the 
Roman Catholic creed. Within the Anglican Church, and even 
within the more strictly Protestant Churches, his influence was 
greater, but in a different direction, viz. in showing the necessity 
of dogma and the indispensableness of the austere, ascetic, 
chastened and graver side of the Christian religion. If his 
teaching as to the Church was less widely followed, it was because 
of doubts as to the thoroughness of his knowledge of history 
and as to his freedom from bias as a critic. Some hundreds of 
clergymen, influenced by the movement of which for ten or 
twelve years he was the acknowledged leader, made their sub- 
mission to the Church of Rome; but a very much larger number, 
who also came under its influence, failed to learn from him that 
belief in the Church involves belief in the pope. The natural 
tendency of his mind is often (and correctly) spoken of as sceptical. 
He held that, apart from an interior and unreasoned conviction, 
there is no cogent proof of the existence of God; and in Tract 85 
he dealt with the difficulties of the Creed and of the canon of 
Scripture, with the apparent implication that they are insur- 
mountable unless overridden by the authority of an infallible 
Church. In his own case these views did not lead to scepticism, 
because he had always possessed the necessary interior con- 
viction; and in writing Tract 85 his only doubt would have been 
where the true Church is to be found. But, so far as the rest of 
the world is concerned, his teaching amounts to this: that the 
man who has not this interior conviction has no choice but to 
remain an agnostic, while the man who has it is bound sooner 
or later to become a Roman Catholic. 

He was a man of magnetic personality, with an intense belief 
in the significance of his own career; and his character may be 
described as feminine, both in its strength and in its weakness. 
As a poet he had inspiration and genuine power. Some of his 
short and earlier poems, in spite of a characteristic element 
of fierceness and intolerance in one or two cases, are described 
by R. H. Hut ton as " unequalled for grandeur of outline, purity 
of taste and radiance of total effect "; while his latest and 
longest, " The Dream of Gerontius," is generally recognized as 
the happiest effort to represent the unseen world that has been 
made since the time of Dante. His prose style, especially in his 
Catholic days, is fresh and vigorous, and is attractive to many 
who do not sympathize with his conclusions, from the apparent 
candour with which difficulties are admitted and grappled with, 
while in his private correspondence there is a charm that places it 
at the head of that branch of English literature. He was too 
sensitive and self-conscious to be altogether successful as a 
leader of men, and too impetuous to take part in public affairs; 
hut he had many of the gifts that go to make a first-rate journalist, 
for, " with all his love for and his profound study of antiquity, 
there was something about him that was conspicuously modern." 
Nevertheless, with the scientific and critical literature of the 
years 1850-1890 he was barely acquainted, and he knew no 
German. There are a few passages in his writings in which he 
seems to show some sympathy with a broader theology. Thus he 
admitted that there was " something true and divinely revealed 
in every religion." He held that " freedom from symbols and 
articles is abstractedly the highest state of Christian communion," 
but was " the peculiar privilege of the primitive Church." And 
even in 1877 he allowed that " in a religion that embraces large 
and separate classes of adherents there always is of necessity 
to a certain extent an exoteric and an esoteric doctrine." These 
admissions, together with his elucidation of the idea of doctrinal 
development and his eloquent assertion of the supremacy of 
conscience, have led some critics to hold that, in spite of all his 
protests to the contrary, he was himself somewhat of a Liberal. 
But it is certain that he explained to his own satisfaction and 
accepted every item of the Roman Catholic creed, even going 
heyond it, as in holding the pope to be infallible in canonization; 
and while expressing his preference for English as compared with 
Italian devotional forms, he was himself one of the first to 
introduce such into England, together with the ritual peculiarities 
of the local Roman Church. The motto that he adopted for 
use with the arms emblazoned for him as cardinal — Cor ad cor 
loquitur, and that which he directed to be engraved on his 
memorial tablet at Edgbaston — Ex umbris et imaginibus in 
veritatem — together seem to disclose as much as can be disclosed 
of the secret of a life which, both to contemporaries and to 
later students, has been one of almost fascinating interest, 
at once devout and inquiring, affectionate and yet sternly 
self-restrained. 

There is at Oxford a bust of Newman by Woolner. His 
portrait by Ouless is at the Birmingham Oratory, and his portrait 
by Millais is in the possession of the duke of Norfolk, a replica 
being at the London Oratory. Outside the latter building, and 
facing the Brompton Road, there is a marble statue of Newman 
as cardinal. (A. W. Hu.) 

The chief authorities for Newman's life are his Apologia and the 
Letters and Correspondence, edited by Miss Mozley, above referred 
to. The letters and memoranda dealing with the years 1845-1890 
were entrusted by Newman to the Rev. W. Neville as literary 
executor. Works by R. W. Church, J. B. Mozley, T. Mozley and 
Wilfrid Ward should also be consulted, as well as an appreciation 
by R. H. Hutton. Adverse criticism will be found in the writings 
of Dr E. A. Abbott (e.g. The Anglican Career of Cardinal Newman, 
2 vols. London, 1892), while some minor traits and foibles were 
noted by A. W. Hutton in the Expositor (September, October and 
November 1890). See also P. Thureau-Dangin, La Renaissance

NEWMARCH, WILLIAM (1820-1882), English economist and 
statistician, was born at Thirsk, Yorkshire, on the 28th of January 
1820. He settled in London in 1846 as an official of the Agra 
Bank, but resigned in 1851 on his appointment as secretary of 
the Globe Insurance Company. This post he held till 1862, when 
he became chief officer in the banking-house of Glyn, Mills & Co., 
in whose employ he remained until 1881. Notwithstanding the 
continuous pressure of an active business life he found time to 
contribute largely many valuable articles to the magazines and 
newspapers, and took an active part in the proceedings of the 
Royal Statistical Society (of which he was one of the honorary 
secretaries, editor of its journal, and in 1 860-1 871 president) 
and the Political Economy Club. He was also elected a fellow of 
the Royal Society. His extensive knowledge of banking was 
displayed in the evidence which he gave before the select com- 
mittee on the Bank Acts in 1857. He collaborated with Thomas 
Tooke in the two final volumes of his History of Prices and was 
responsible for the greater part of the work in those volumes. 
For nineteen years he wrote an admirable survey of the com- 
mercial history of the year in the Economist. He died at Torquay 
on the 23rd of March 1882. After his death his friends founded, 
in perpetuation of his memory, a Newmarch Lectureship in 
economic science and statistics at University College, London. 


NEWMARKET, a market town in the Newmarket parlia- 
mentary division of Cambridgeshire, England, 13^ m. E. by N. 
of Cambridge on the Bury branch of the Great Eastern railway. 
Pop. (1001) 10,688. A part of the town is in Suffolk, and the 
urban district is in the administrative county of West Suffolk. 
Newmarket has been celebrated for its horse-races from the time 
of James I., though at that time there was more of coursing and 
hawking than horse-racing. Charles I. instituted the first cup- 
race here. For the use of Charles II., during his visits to the 
races, a palace, no longer extant, was built on the site of the lodge 
of James I. There are numerous residences belonging to patrons 
of the turf, together with stables, and racing and training 
establishments. The racecourse, which lies south-west of the 
town, has a full extent of 4 m., but is divided into various lengths 
to suit the different races. The course intersects the so-called 
Devil's Ditch or Dyke (sometimes also known as St Edmund's 
Dyke), an earthwork consisting of a ditch and mound stretching 
almost straight for 5 m. from Reach to Wood Ditton. It is 12 ft. 
wide at the top, 18 ft. above the level of the country, and 30 ft. 
above the bottom of the ditch, with a slope of 50 ft. on the 
sbuth-west side and 26 ft. on the north-east. It formed part of 
the boundary between the kingdoms of East Anglia and Mercia, 
but is doubtless of much earlier origin. Roman remains have 
been found in the neighbourhood. 


NEW MECKLENBURG (Ger, Neu- Mecklenburg, formerly New 
Ireland^ native Totnbara), an island of the Bismarck Archipelago, 
N.E. of New Guinea in the Pacific Ocean, about 3 S., 152 E., 
in the administration of German New Guinea. It is about 
240 m. long but seldom over 15 wide. From St George 's Channel 
at the south, separating it from New Pomerania, it sweeps north 
and then north-west, being divided from New Hanover at the 
other extremity by Byron Strait. It is mountainous throughout, 
having an extreme elevation of about 6500 ft. in the north, 
where the prevalent formations are sandstone and limestone, 
whereas in the south they are granite, porphyry and basalt. 
There is a white population of about forty; the natives are 
Papuans of a less fine type than the natives of New Pomerania, 
and rather resemble the Solomon islanders. Jacob Lemaire and 
Willem Cornell's Schouten sighted New Mecklenburg in 161 6, 
but it was only recognized as part of an island separate from New 
Guinea by William Dampier in 1700, and as separate from New 
Pomerania in 1767 by Philip Carteret. 


NEW MEXICO, a south-western state of the United States, 
lying between 31 20' and 37 N. lat., and 103* and ioo° 2' 
W. long. It is bounded N. by Colorado; E. by Oklahoma and 
Texas; S. by Texas and Mexico; and W. by Arizona. It has 
an extreme length N. and S. of 400 m., an extreme width E. and 
W. of 358 m., and a total area of 122,634 sq. m., of which 131 
sq. m. are water-surface. 

Physiography. — New Mexico is a region of mountains and 
high plateaus. Broadly speaking, its surface is a vast tableland 
tilted toward the S. and E., and broken by parallel ranges of 
mountains whose trend is most frequently N. and S. About 
midway between the western boundary and the Rio Grande 
passes the Continental Divide, which separates the waters 
entering the Gulf of Mexico from those that flow into the Gulf 
of California. In the region E. of the Continental Divide, which 
embraces about three-fourths of the surface of the state, 
the general south-eastern slope is very marked. Thus, at Santa 
Fe, in the north central part of the state, the elevation is 
7013 ft.; at Raton, in the N.E., 6400 ft.; at Las Cruces, in the 
extreme S., 3570 ft.; and at Red Bluff, in the extreme S.E., 
2876 ft. 

The Rocky Mountain system enters New Mexico near the centre 
of the northern boundary; its main ridge, lying E. of the Rio 
Grande, extends as far S. as the city of Santa F6. It forms the 
water-parting between the upper waters of the Canadian river and 
the Rio Grande, and contains many of the loftiest peaks in New 
Mexico, among them being Truchas (13,275 ft.), Costilla (12,634 ft-) 
and Baldy (12,623 ft.). On the E. this ridge is bounded by the region 
of the Great Plains, the dissected tonography of which is character- 
ized by many broad valleys intervening. W. of the Rio Grande lies 
a series of lower ranges, also a part of the Rocky Mountain system, 
whose western slopes merge almost imperceptibly with the Plateau 
Region. The San Juan, Gallinas and Nacimiento ranges are among 
the most notable in this group. South of the Rocky Mountains lies 
the so-caljed Basin Region, in which isolated, but sometimes lofty 
and massive, mountains, the result in many instances of a series of 
numerous parallel faults, rise from level plains like islands from the 
sea and enclose the valleys with bare walls of grey and brown rock. 
These valley plains, from 10 m. to 20 m. wide and sometimes 100 m. 
long, sloping gradually toward their centres, are usually covered 
with detritus from the neighbouring mountains, and seldom have 
a distinct drainage outlet. The Spaniards called them " bolsons " 
(purses), a term that geologists have retained. In many of these 
bolsons are ephemeral Takes, in which the waters collect during the 
rainy season and stand for several months. These waters are fre- 
quently impregnated with alkali or salt, and on evaporating leave 
upon the bed of the lake a thin encrustation of snowy whiteness. 
Such beds, locally known as " alkali flats," are especially numerous 
in Valencia, Socorro, Dona Ana and Otero counties, and a number 
of them furnish all the salt needed by the cattle ranges in their 
vicinity. East of the San Andreas Range, in the south central part 
of New Mexico, lies the basin of the extinct LakeOtero, in which 
are found the remarkable " white sands," consisting of dunes of 
almost pure granular gypsum and covering the area of 300 sq. m. 
In this region many species of reptiles and insects are almost perfectly 
white — an interesting example of protective coloration. Both E. 
and W. of the central portion of the Basin Region the bolson plains 
soon lose their distinctive character, the valleys become wider and 
broader and the mountains less lofty and more isolated. East of the 
Pecos and S. of the Canadian rivers lies the great arid tableland known 
as the Staked Plains (Llano Estacado),a vast stretch of barren wastes, 
with almost nothing to break the monotony of its landscape. This 
is a part of the Great Plains and a continuation of the high plains 
region of Texas. The Plateau Region includes most of the area N.

of the Gila river and W. of the Rio Grande. Here volcanic activity 
and powerful erosion have combined to produce a series of remarkable 
scenic effects. The eastern border 01 this area is formed by the 
valley of the Rio Grande and the western foot-hills of the Rocky 
Mountains; the southern boundary overlooks the Gila river; and on 
the N. and W. the plateau continues into Colorado, Utah and Arizona. 
Near its southern and eastern borders are many lava flows and 
extinct volcanic mountains, one of the most imposing of those in 
New Mexico being the Mt. Taylor volcano (11,389 ft.), which is 
surrounded by lava tables and some of the most wonderful volcanic 
buttes in the world. In other portions of New Mexico there is 
also much evidence of former volcanic activity. A conspicuous 
feature of the New Mexican landscape is the mesa, a flat-topped hill 
created by differential erosion and projecting above the surrounding 
country like a table. A notable example is the mesa of Acoma, in 
Valencia county, capped with volcanic rocks; upon its summit, 
about 350 ft. above the plain, is the Indian pueblo of Acoma. 

The average elevation of New Mexico is 5700 ft., with 40,200 
sq. m. between 3000 and 5000 ft.; 56,680 sq. m. between 5000 and 
7000 ft.; 22,500 sq. m. between 7000 and 9000 ft.; and 2000 sq. m. 
above 9000 ft. 

For a region with such a small amount of rainfall the rivers are 
numerous, but none of the streams is navigable, and in many of them 
during the dry season (and in some of them because of broken 
stratification) the water in places disappears entirely beneath the 
sandy bed, and after flowing underground for some distance, breaks 
out afresh farther on as a river, rivulet or spring. The most im- 
portant stream is the Rio Grande, which, rising in southern Colorado, 
enters New Mexico through deep canyons near the centre of the 
northern boundary and continues southward across the entire state. 
During its course it changes from a mountain stream in the N. 
to a sluggish river turgid with sand in the S. In the lowlands it 
loses much of its volume through evaporation and absorption by 
the sands, and through irrigation, and in its lower course in New 
Mexico its bed is frequently dry. In the flood season it usually 
leaves its banks and inundates the lowlands, spreading over the 
sands a rich deposit of silt; and on account of this characteristic 
it is sometimes called " the Nile of New Mexico.*' The stream next 
in importance is the Pecos river, which rises in Mora county and 
flows southward into Texas, where *t joins the Rio Grande. It has 
the same general characteristics as the latter river, being a mountain 
stream near its source, and alter leaving the highlands becoming 
sluggish and losing much of its water. Along the lower course many 
underground streams from the mountains break out as springs and 
empty into the Pecos. The Canadian river drains the eastern slope 
of the Rocky Mountains and flows in a general south-easterly 
direction through Texas into Oklahoma, where it empties into the 
Arkansas. Most oHts course in New Mexico lies through a canyon. 
The westward-flowing streams — the San Juan, Rio Puerco of the 
West, Zuni, Rio San Francisco and pila — are of only slight im- 
portance, though their flow is perennial. In the valleys there are 
many small streams whose waters never reach the ocean, but 
disappear by seepage or evaporation. 

Fauna and Flora. — Of native animals the species are numerous, 
but their numbers are small. Bison no longer roam the plains, and 
the elk has been driven out; but among the larger mammals still 
to be found in certain districts are the deer, prong-horn (in small 
numbers), puma, coyote, timber wolf, lynx (Lynx rufus and Lynx 
Canadensis) and the black and grizzly bear. Badgers, hares and 
rabbits are found everywhere, and prairie-dogs are so numerous in 
some places as to be considered a. nuisance. There are numerous 
species of aquatic birds. From time to time upon the Rio Grande 
may be seen ducks, wild geese, swans, cranes, herons and gulls. 
Eagles are often seen, and in the arid and elevated regions crows and 
ravens are numerous. Gamble's quail, bob-white, grouse, English 
pheasants and wild turkeys are the most important game birds, and 
the mocking-bird is common throughout south-western New Mexico. 
Among the venomous reptiles and insects are the rattlesnake, the 
Gila monster (Heloderma suspectum), a poisonous lizard, and the 
tarantula (Mygale Heintzii), which, however, are common only in 
certain places and at certain seasons. 

New Mexico has such a great range of elevations that all four of 
the zones of vegetation into which the South-West has been divided 
according to altitude are found within its limits; namely, the zone 
of cactus, yucca and agave (3000-3500 ft.), where grass is scanty; 
the zone of greasewood and sage-brush (3500-4900 ft.), where there 
is little grass, and the cactus species are less numerous; the zone of 
the cedar (4.900-6800 ft.); and the zone of the pine and fir (6800- 
10,800 ft.), in which grass is more abundant. The total woodland 
area has been estimated at 23,700 sq. m., or a little more than 19% 
of the land area. Only the higher ranges and plateaus are timbered, 
and even there the forests are not dense! The lower slopes are 
usually covered with the scrub oak, juniper and pinon; but some 
mountains, especially those along the eastern border of the Rio 
Grande Valley, are absolutely treeless. The principal forest areas 
are upon the southern end of the San Juan Range, upon the Sangre 
de Cristo Range and in Socorro county, W. of the Rio Grande. 
The chief varieties of timber are the red fir, Engelmann's spruce and 
yellow pine. Up to^ 1910 the Federal government had created 
eleven forest reservations in New Mexico, embracing an area of 
10,971,711 acres. In the valleys the only trees native to the soil 
are the willow and cottonwood, found along the water courses, and 
beyond the range of irrigation vegetation is limited to scanty grass, 
with sage-brush and greasewood in the N. and cactus and yucca 
in the S. 

Climate. — As the winds that reach New Mexico have been desic- 
cated while crossing the plains of Texas or the mountains of the 
N.W., the climate is characterized by a lack of humidity. The sandy 
soil quickly absorbs the sun'sheat and also quickly radiates it, so 
that there is great daily variation in the temperature. The low 
humidity, high altitudes and southern latitude all combine to make 
the climate salubrious and especially beneficial to persons suffering 
with pulmonary disorders. The highest temperature ever recorded 
was 110 F. at Roswell; the lowest, -23 at Aztec. At Santa Fe\ 
where mountain and plain meet, the mean annual temperature is 
49 ; the mean for the winter is 31 and for the summer 67 °; and 
the highest and lowest temperatures ever recorded were respectively 
97 and -1 3 . At Fort Bayard, in the S.W., the mean temperature 
for the year is 55 ; the mean for the winteHs 39 , with an extreme 
recorded of -1 ; the mean for the summer is 72 °, with a maximum 
recorded of 103 . At Mesilla Park, in the lower Rio Grande Valley, 
the mean annual temperature is 6o°; for the winter it is 43 , with a 
minimum of i°, and for the summer 77 , with a maximum of 106 . 
In all parts of New Mexico except the N.W. there is a so-called wet 
season, which begins early in July and lasts for a'month or six weeks, 
the rain coming in the form of short afternoon thunderstorms. 
About a third of the precipitation occurs during July and August, 
but after August the monthly precipitation is steadily less until 
March, in which month only about 3 % of the annual rainfall occurs. 
For all of New Mexico the mean precipitation is about 13 in., 
ranging from 9 in. in the lower Rio Grande Valley to 25 in. on the 
mountain ranges at elevations of 10,000 ft. and over. In the valleys 
there are usually about two snows a year and these quickly disappear; 
but on the mountain peaks and in the canyons the snow accumulates 
to great depths and forms a steady source of water-supply for the 
rivers. It is the melting of the snows on the Rocky Mountains, and 
not the rainy season, that produces the floods of the Rio Grande. 

Soils. — The prevailing, type of soil on the higher lands is a sandy 
loam, underlaid with clay or clay loam, which stores water and is 
the typical soil of the basins. Along the m river valleys there are 
limited areas of fine sediment, and here with irrigation good crops 
can be grown without the use of fertilizers. In the plains where 
drainage is poor, especially in the S., the soils contain too much 
alkali; but in the highlands most of this has been dissolved and 
carried away by the rains, and the soils are well adapted for grazing 
grounds. 

Agriculture. — Because of the small amount of rainfall, agriculture 
is confined chiefly to the river valleys. In 1900 only 4-2 % of the 
land surface was included in farms, and less than *27 of 1 % was 
classed as improved farm land. The total acreage, however, rose 
from 787,882 in 1890 to 5,130,878 in 1900, an increase of 551-2%. 
Between 1850 and 1880 there was very little increase in farm area. 
The amount of improved land, though showing an absolute increase 
between 1880 and 1900, declined relatively to the total area in farms 
from 37-6% in 1880 to 6*4% in 1900. At the same time the average 
size of farms (not including farms with an area of less than 3 acres, 
which reported an annual income of less than $500) increased from 
124*0. acres in 1880 to 433*6 acres in 1900. This decrease in the pro- 
portion of improved acreage and increase in the average size of the 
farms is due to the increased use of lands for grazing purposes. 
As regards tenure, 90-6% of the farms in 1900 were operated by 
owners, 2-2% by cash tenants, and 7*2% by^ share tenants. In 
this year 39*6% of the farms derived their principal income from 
hay and grain, 33-2% from live stock, 5'5% from dairy produce, 
3*5% from vegetables, 2^8% from fruits. ^ The most important 
crop, as a result of irrigation, is alfalfa, which is grown for forage, 
requires little attention, and improves the soil. Wheat, Indian corn 
and oats are the leading cereal crops; and S. of the latitude of 
Santa Fe* vegetables and deciduous fruits flourish where the water- 
supply is ample. A little cotton has been grown near Carlsbad in 
the Pecos Valley, and in 1909 sugar beets were introduced south of 
Albuquerque and cantaloupes in the southern Rio Grande Valley. 
Fruit, especially the Bartlett pear, is very successful. The total 
value of farm property in 1900 was $53*767,824, and the value of 
the live stock, §31,727,400. The value of the farm products in 1879 
was $1,807,974, in l88 9 $1,784,824, and in 1899 $10,155,215. 
In 1909 the values of the principal farm products (according to the 
Year Book of the U.S. Department of Agriculture) were as follows: 
hay, $5,339,000; wheat, $1,175,000; Indian corn, $1,915,000; 
oats, $634,000; and potatoes, $86,000. The values of the various 
classes of live stock on the 1st of January 1910 were as follows: 
sheep, $13,714,000; milch cows, $1,125,000; other neat cattle, 
$15,677,000; horses, $6,251,000; ^ mules, $632,000; swine, 
$272,000. Stock-raising is the most important industry, and the 
growing of sheep for wool takes a leading place. The hills and mesas 
covered with the nutritious grama grass form excellent grazing 
grounds, which are most extensive in Bernalillo, Guadalupe, Rio 
Arriba, San Miguel, Union and Valencia counties. In April 1907 
(according to an estimate of the National Association of Wool 
Manufacturers) New Mexico contained 2,600,000 sheep, the largest 
number in any state or Territory except Montana and Wyoming; 
and in April 1909 there were 3,200,000 sheep of shearing age in 
New Mexico, but this number was less than that in Montana or 
Wyoming at that time. 

Except in a few mountain valleys in the N., agriculture was long 
entirely dependent upon irrigation, which has been practised in 
New Mexico by the Pueblo Indians since prehistoric times. In 1899 
the total irrigated area outside of Indian reservations amounted to 
203,893 acres (67-2% of all improved land) — an increase of 122*2% 
in the preceding decade. Of the total land in crops in that year 
89-2% was irrigated. After the passage of the Federal Reclamation 
Act in 1902, a number of extensive irrigation works in New Mexico 
were undertaken by the Federal government. The Carlsbad reservoir 
and diverting dam in Eddy county and the Rio Hondo canals and 
reservoir in Chaves county were completed in 1907 and are capable 
of supplying water to tracts of 20,000 and 10,000 acres respectively. 
In 1908 an irrigation reservoir in McKinley county for the use of the 
Zuni Indians and the Leasburg project (Dona Ana county; 20,000 
acres) were completed. The Rio Grande project was planned in 1907 
for the storage of the flood waters of the Rio Grande near Engle, New 
Mexico, in order to reclaim about 155,000 acres of land in New Mexico 
and Texas, and to deliver to Mexico above the city of Juarez 60,000 
acre- feet of water per year, as provided by a treaty (proclaimed on the 
16th of January 1907) between that republic and the United States. 
Other systems contemplated by the government were the Las Vegas 
project for reclaiming 10,000 acres near Las Vegas, the Urton Lake 
project for reclaiming 60,000 acres in the Pecos Valley, and the La 
Plata Valley project for irrigating about 40,000 acres in the north- 
western part of New Mexico, 35 m. S.W. of Durango, Colorado. A 
special irrigation commission was appointed in 1897, and in 1905 the 
legislature created the office of Territorial irrigation engineer. Irriga T 
tion by private companies is of some importance, especially in the San 
Juan Valley, the Rio Grande Valley and the Pecos Valley. In 1909 it 
was estimated that about 500,000 acres were irrigated. Dry farming 
has proved a great success in New Mexico, as elsewhere in the South- 
West, especially since 1900; and in 1907 it was estimated that 
2,000,000 acres were cultivated without irrigation. 

Manufactures. — As New Mexico is primarily a mining and stock- 
raising region, its manufacturing industries are of comparatively 
small importance. The value of the manufactured products in 
1880 was $1,284,846; in 1890 $1,516,195; and * n *9<>o $5,605,795. 
an increase in the latter decade of 2697%. In 1905 there were 199 
establishments under the factory system (an increase of 14*4% 
over the number in 1900); the amount of capital invested was 
$4,638,248, and the value of " factory " products was $5,705,880 
(an increase of 40*5% over the value of the " factory " products in 
1900). The leading industries in 1905 were the construction of cars 
and general railway shop and repair work by steam railway companies 
(value of product, $2,509,845), the manufacture of lumber and timber 
products (value $1,315,364) and of flour and grist mill products 
(value $388,124), and the printing and publishing of newspapers and 
periodicals (value $279,858). In 1900 the manufactures of Albu- 
querque, Santa Fe and Socorro were valued at 39*4% of tne total 
value of New Mexico's products. 

Minerals. — The existence of valuable mineral deposits was early 
known to the Spaniards. There was some production of gold by the 
Mexicans, but the silver mining was unimportant until 1881, when 
the Lake Valley silver mines in Sierra county began to yield. Be- 
tween that year and 1884 the coining value of the silver product 
increased from $275,000 to $3,000,000. After 1885 there was a 
gradual decline in the output, whose bullion value in 1908 was 
$250,986. The production of gold has shown a somewhat similar 
movement; the output in 1881 was valued at $185,000; in 1889, 
at $1,000,000, and in 1908 at $298,757. The leading gold- and 
silver-producing counties are Socorro, Grant, Sierra and Dona Ana. 
Only silver is mined in the last-named county. Copper has been mined 
for many years, and in 1906 and 1908 constituted New Mexico's most 
valuable metallic product, the value of the yield in these years being 
$1,356,533 and $658,858 respectively. Nearly all the product comes 
from Grant county, and in 1908 nearly 98% of the output was from 
Grant and Otero counties. In 1 905-1 908 the decrease in output was 
large. In the same years there was an increase in the output of 
zinc, which in 1906 was valued at $67,710 and in 1908 at $168,096. 
Most of the zinc comes from Socorro county, where the mines of the 
Magdalena District in 1908 yielded 93% of the entire product. 
A small amount of lead is produced incidentally to the mining of 
zinc, being derived from mixed lead and zinc ores. Far the most 
important mineral product, however, is coal, which is found in all 
forms — lignite to anthracite — and in widely distributed areas. 
The chief centres of production are the Raton field, in Colfax county ; 
the Durango-Gallup field, in McKinley and Rio Arriba counties; 
the Whiteoaks field, in Lincoln county; and the Los Cerillos and 
Tejon areas, in Santa F6 county. Much of the coal is suitable for 
coke, of which a considerable amount is manufactured. The value 
of the coal product in 1902 was $1,500,230; in 1904, $i,9°4499; 
and in 1908, $3,368,753. Iron ores arc widely distributed, but have 
not been developed; graphite is mined in Colfax county; mica in 
Taos county, and to a small extent in Rio Arriba county; marble is 
quarried in Otero county and sandstone in Bernalillo, Colfax and 
San Miguel counties. Gypsum beds are widely distributed, and the 
supply is inexhaustible, but their great distance from centres of con- 
sumption has prevented their profitable working. In New Mexico 
are found turquoises and a few garnets; it seems probable that 
turquoises were mined by the Aztecs. The largest of the old Spanish 
turquoise mines in the Cerillos District, 18 m. S. of Santa Fe, furnished 
a turquoise product between 1890 and 1900 valued at more than 
$2,000,000. Other mines are in Grant and Otero counties. The 
New Mexican garnets are found in McKinley county. The output 
of precious stones in 1902 was valued at $51,100, in 1908 at $72,100. 
Transportation. — The total railway mileage on the 3 1st of December 
1908 was 2,918-02, more than twice as much as that of 1890. 
The length of railway per inhabitant in New Mexico in 1907 was 
about five times as great as that for the whole country, but the 
amount of line per square mile of territory was only about one-third 
as great as the average for the United States. New Mexico is 
traversed by two transcontinental lines, the Atchison, Topeka & 
Santa Fe, from Chicago to San Francisco and the Southern Pacific, 
from New Orleans to San Francisco. The main line of the former 
enters New Mexico near Raton, extends S.W. to Albuquerque and 
thence westward into Arizona. A southward extension taps the 
Southern Pacific at El Paso, Texas, and Deming, New Mexico, and 
there are numerous shorter branches. This system also controls the 
Pecos Valley & North-Eastern railway, which serves the south- 
western part of New Mexico. The Southern Pacific crosses New 
Mexico westward from El Paso, Texas. The western division of 
the El Paso & South-Western system, connecting El Paso and 
Benson, Arizona, crosses New Mexico just N. of the Mexican 
boundary. Its eastern division (including the El Paso & North- 
Eastern, the El Paso & Rock Island, the Alamogordo & Sacramento 
Mountain and the Dawson railways) connects with the Chicago, 
Rock Island & Pacific at Tucumcari; thus forming a connecting 
link between that system and the Southern Pacific. The Santa Fe 
Central, extending southward from Santa Fe to Torrance, is a con- 
necting link between the Atchison, Topeka & Santa F€ and the El 
Paso & South- Western systems. Branches of the Denver & Rio 
Grande serve the northern parts of New Mexico. 

Population. — The population of New Mexico consists of 
three distinct classes — Indians; Spanish-Americans, locally 
known as " Mexicans "; and the English-speaking class called, 
in distinction from the others, " Americans." Of the Indians 
there are two types, both of the Athapascan family; in one are 
the Pueblos, and in the other the Navahos, in the N.W. part of 
the state, and their near kinsmen, the Apaches, to the south. 
The Pueblo Indians live in adobe houses, are quiet and usually 
self-sustaining, and have been converted to the forms of Christi- 
anity. They had irrigated farms and dwelt in six-storey com- 
munal houses long before the advent of the white man. By the 
treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, in 1848, the United States govern- 
ment recognized them as citizens. They lived in 19 villages of 
pueblos, the largest of which, Zuni, is more properly called a 
reservation, as it has been enlarged from time to time by grants 
from the Federal government. The 18 pueblos and the Zufii 
reservation contained in 1900 a population of 8127, and a total 
area of 1417 sq. m. The pueblos are held under Spanish grants 
which were confirmed by the United States. The terraced 
architecture of the villages is very remarkable. Originally the 
Pueblo Indians b'ved in many-storeyed communal houses, built 
sometimes of stone, sometimes of adobe, and occasionally 
chiselled into the sides of a stone cliff, as best suited the con- 
venience of the builders. At present there is a tendency among 
them to copy the one-storey huts of the Mexicans. Taos (pop. 
in 1900, 419) is one of the most imposing of the pueblos, consisting 
of two six-storeyed pyramidal tenements, separated by a brook. 
Zuni > (pop. 1525) has a five-storeyed dwelling surrounded 
by detached huts; Acoma (pop. 492 in 1900; 566 in 1902), 
standing on a cliff 357 ft. high (Acoma means " people of the 
white rock " and Aco, the Indian name for the pueblo, means 
" white rock "), contains three blocks of three-storeyed terraced 
buildings, 1 and Laguna also contains some three-storeyed 

	1 About 3 m. N.E. of Acoma stands the Enchanted Mesa (Mesa 
	Encantada; Katzimo in Keresan), rising 430 ft. above the plain, 
	and being 2050 ft. long and 100 to 350 ft. wide. Upon its summit, 
	according to Indian tradition, once stood the village of Acoma, 
	but while the inhabitants were tending their crops in the plains a 
	powerful earth movement threw down the rocky ladder by which 
	alone the summit could be reached. According to the story, three 
	women had been left in the village and these perished. The Mesa 
	was first climbed by white men in 1896 by Prof. William Libbey 
	(b. 1855), of Princeton University; it was climbed again in 1897 
	by a party led by F. W. Hodge; and pottery and stone implements 
	I were found here. 

dwellings, but the Laguna tribe, numbering, 1077 in 1900 and 
1384 in 1905, now live mostly in their former summer villages 
on the plain. The other Indians live on reservations, of which 
there are three: the Mescalero Apache reservation, in Otero 
county, containing 554 Indians in 1000; the Jicarilla Apache 
reservation, in Rio Arriba county, with a population of 829; 
and the Navaho reservation, in Utah, Arizona and New Mexico, 
which contains in that part of it situated in New Mexico a 
population of 2480. 

The inhabitants of Spanish descent have been only slightly 
assimilated and cling tenaciously to their racial peculiarities. 
As a rule, they live in low adobe houses built around a court, 
and are poor and ignorant, but hospitable. They are more 
Americanized in the Rio Grande Valley than among the moun- 
tains, where English is rarely spoken. Many of them have 
intermarried with the Indians, creating the class of half-breeds 
known as " Mestizos." Although the proportion of Spanish- 
American and Indian inhabitants is steadily decreasing with the 
arrival of immigrants from other parts of the United States, it 
was nevertheless computed by the New Mexican authorities to be 
about 63% in 1904. About one-tenth of the Spanish-American 
and Indian population habitually use the English language. 

The total population of New Mexico in 1870 was 91,^74; 
in 1880, 119,565; in 1890, 153,593; in 1900, 195,310,' and 
in 1 910, according to the U.S. census, the figure was 327,301. 
Of the native white population in 1900, 17,917 were of foreign 
parentage. Of the foreign-born element 6649, or about one-half, 
were Mexicans, 1360 were Germans and the rest chiefly English, 
Irish, Canadians, Italians, Scotch and Austrians. The chief 
cities were Albuquerque (6238), Santa Fe (5603), Las Vegas 
(3552) and Raton (3540). Far the greater portion of the popula- 
tion (in 1906, 56*2% of the estimated population) are communi- 
cants of the Roman Catholic Church, which had in 1906 121,558 
members, the total communicants of all denominations in that 
year numbering 137,009. Among Protestants there were 6560 
Methodists, 2935 Presbyterians and 2331 Baptists. 

Administration. — The executive officers until 1911 were a 
governor and a Territorial secretary appointed by the President 
of the United States, and a treasurer, auditor, superintendent of 
public instruction, adjutant-general, commissioner of public 
lands and other administrative officials appointed by the 
governor. The legislative department included a council of 
12 members and a House of Representatives of 24 members, 
chosen by popular vote. The sessions were biennial and limited 
to 60 days. All laws passed by the Assembly and approved by the 
governor had to be submitted to the Federal Congress for its ap- 
proval. The Territory was represented in Congress by a delegate, 
chosen by popular vote, with the right to speak in the national 
legislature but not to vote. The judicial department included 
a supreme court, district courts, probate courts and local justices 
of the peace. The supreme court consisted of a chief justice and 
six associate justices appointed by the President. There were 
seven judicial districts, each with a court presided over by a 
justice of the supreme court. Each county had a probate court, 
and each precinct a justice of the peace. 

For .the purposes of local government New Mexico is divided 
into 26 counties, each being -governed by a board of county 
commissioners, chosen by the people. Each county is divided by 
the commissioners into precincts. Municipal corporations with 
a population of 3000 and over are cities, and are governed through 
a mayor and board of aldermen; those with a population of 
between 1500 and 3000 are towns, and are governed through a 
mayor and trustees. 

A rather unusual institution within New Mexico is the mounted 
police, who numbered n in 1907, whose work was almost entirely 
in the cattle country, and who had authority to patrol the entire 
Territory and to make arrests or to preserve order wherever their 
presence was needed, unhampered by the restrictions limiting the 
jurisdiction of local police. 

A homestead not exceeding $1000 in value, and held by a husband 
and wife or by a widow or widower with an unmarried daughter or 
an unmarried minor son, may be held exempt from seizure and sale 
by legal process. -The exemption may be claimed by either the 
husband or the wife, but may not be granted if each owns a home- 
stead; and it does not extend to judgments rendered against the 
debtor on account of a mortgage, non-payment of the purchase 
money or supplies and labour for building and repairs. 

In 1907 the legislature passed a radical measure, making the pen- 
alty for operating games of chance six months* imprisonment in the 
county-jail, and, at the discretion of the court, a fine of not less 
than Si 00 and not more than $500; this law went into effect on 
the 1st of January 1908. Gambling had formerly been licensed — 
the gambling-house keeper paying $200 per annum for each gaming 
table or apparatus, this sum going to the district and county school 
funds. 

Revenues for the support of the government are derived chiefly 
from the general property tax. There are also special corporation 
taxes on car companies, express companies and foreign corporations 
producing, refining or selling petroleum or coal oil: and a system of 
licence-charges or business taxes. A poll tax is levied by the state 
for school purposes and may also be levied by municipalities. The 
county and the municipal tax rates are limited respectively to 5 and 
10 mills on the dollar. A special tax not exceeding 3 mills on the 
dollar may be levied on all taxable property for school purposes, 
and the proceeds apportioned among the school districts according 
to the number of school children. The proceeds of the poll tax are 
distributed in the counties in which tne tax is collected. Each 
school district may supplement the aid from the state by laying special 
taxes, and the Federal government has granted to each township 
4 sq. m. of public land to aid in the support of the schools. Land- 
grants amounting in 1907 to 1,343,080 acies had also been made for 
the benefit of various educational, charitable and correctional 
institutions, and for irrigation purposes. At the close of the fiscal 
year ending on the 31st of May 1908, New Mexico showed ex- 
penditures of §721,272*81, receipts of $754,080*94 and a balance in 
the treasury of $378,653-63. The bonded debt, amounting on the 
31st of May 1908 to 5788,000, was incurred partly in meeting 
temporary deficits in the treasury and partly in the construction of 
public buildings. 

Education. — At the head of the public school system is a Board of 
Education of seven members, including the governor and the super- 
intendent of public instruction; this Board apportions the school 
fund among the counties, selects the text-books and prepares the 
examinations for teachers. /The superintendent of public instruction 
exercises a general supervision over the schools of New Mexico. 
There is also a superintendent of schools for each county, and the 
counties are divided into school districts, each having three directors, 
who disburse the school funds and have the care of the school 
property. In incorporated cities and towns these functions are dis- 
charged by local boards of education. The school age is from five to 
twenty-one years, and for children between the ages of seven and 
fourteen school attendance for three months in each year is com- 
pulsory. The total enrollment for the year ending the 1st of August 
1906 was 39,377, "with an average daily attendance of 25,174; the 
average length of the school year was 5 months and 19 days. The 
use of English in the schoolroom is required by law; New Mexico has 
adopted a uniform system of text-books. 

The state supports the University of New Mexico at Albu- 
querque; a College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts 1 (established 
1889, opened 1890) at Mesilla Park, 40 m. from El Paso; a Normal 
School at Silver City (pop. 1900, 2735; county-seat of Grant 
county); a Normal University at Las Vegas; a School of Mines (at 
Socorro; pop. 1000, 1512; county-seat of Socorro county), which 
was founded in 1889, was organized and opened in 1895 when it 
received from Congress 50,000 acres of land, has in its library the 
private library of John W. Powell, formerly director of the U.S. 
Geological Survey, and owns the Torrance Mine at the foot of 
Socorro Mountain, 2 m. from the college campus; and a Military 
Institute at Roswell (pop. 1900, 2006; county-seat of Chaves 
county). Indian day schools are maintained by the Federal 
government at Albuquerque, Jicarilla, Santa Fe" and Zuni. 

The state maintains an insane asylum at Las Vegas, a deaf 
and dumb asylum and penitentiary at Santa Fe\ an institute for 
the blind at Almagordo, a reform school at El Rito and a miners' 
hospital at Raton. For many years the legislature has also contri- 
buted to the support of a number of private hospitals and charitable 
institutions. 

History. — To the existence of an Old-World myth New Mexico 
owes its early exploration by the Spaniards. Early in the 
1 6th century it was believed that in the New World would be 
found the fabled cities and creatures of which Europeans had 
heard for centuries. There was a story that in the 8th century 
a bishop of Lisbon, to escape from the Arabs, had fled to islands 
in the West, where he and his followers had founded seven cities; 
and when the Indians in Mexico related to the Spanish explorers 
a bit of their folk-lore, to the effect that they had issued from 
seven caves, the imaginative white men soon identified these 
caves with the famous Seven Cities. In 1536 came Cabeza 

	! This college also receives Federal aid: 100,000 acres of public 
	land were voted to it in 1898. 

de Vaca into Mexico after eight years of wandering across the 
continent and related to his countrymen the stories he had 
heard of wonderful cities of stone in the north. He had not 
seen the cities himself, nor had he, as is frequently asserted, 
gone as far north as the present New Mexico, but his reports 
tended to confirm previous rumours and led the viceroy, Don 
Antonio de Mendoza, to send Fray Marcos de Niza, a Franciscan 
friar, on a small and inexpensive expedition of discovery. 

Fray Marcos (q.v .) was the first European to enter the limits of 
what is now New Mexico. A glimpse of the terraced houses of an 
Indian village — now identified as Zufii — convinced him that he 
had seen one of the Seven Cities, and he hastened back with the 
good news. The stories that he told grew in their passage from 
mouth to mouth until the Spaniards believed that in the north 
were cities " very rich, having silversmiths, and that the women 
wore strings of gold beads and the men girdles of gold." Full of 
missionary zeal, and desirous that settlements should be planted 
in the new region in order that the heathen might be converted, 
Fray Marcos did little to refute these exaggerations. The con- 
quest of the Seven Cities was determined upon, and a band of 
adventurers, led by Francisco Vasquez de Coronado (q.v.),set out 
in 1539. Following the route of Fray Marcos de Niza, Coronado 
reached the first of the alleged cities, and to his great disappoint- 
ment found only an Indian pueblo. An exploring party sent 
eastward reached Acoma, and then proceeded to Tiguex on the 
Rio Grande, and finally to the Pecos river. The main body of 
Coronado's expedition remained in New Mexico on the Rio 
Grande while he pushed on to the fabled land of Quivira, 1 only 
to meet with another disappointment. 

Forty years elapsed before the Spaniards again entered New 
Mexico. In 1581 Fray Augustin Rodriguez, another Franciscan, 
explored the valley of the Rio Grande, and in 1582-1583 Antonio 
Espejo made extended explorations to the E. and W. of this 
stream. It was about this time, apparently, that the Spaniards 
in Mexico adopted the term New Mexico to designate the land 
to the north; Rodriguez had called the country San Felipe, 
and Espejo had named it Nueva Andalucia. Between 1583 and 
1595 several attempts at the conquest and occupation of New 
Mexico were made, but for various reasons they were unsuccessful. 
In the spring of 1598 Don Juan de Onate entered New Mexico 
with about 400 colonists, and choosing the pueblo of San Juan 
(30 m. N.W. of the modern Santa Fe) as a temporary dwelling- 
place, made preparations for building a town at the junction of 
the Rio Chama and the Rio Grande, to be known as San Francisco. 
In the following year the new settlement was renamed San 
Gabriel. Some years later a second settlement was made at 
Santa F6, which has ever since been the seat of government of 
New Mexico. Although the Franciscan missionaries by 161 7 had 
built seven churches and had baptized 14,000 Indians, there were 
in this year only 48 soldiers and settlers in the province. The 
zeal of the friars in stamping out the religious rites of the natives, 
the severe penalties inflicted for non-observance of the rules of 
the Church, and the heavy tribute in kind demanded by the 
Spanish authorities, aroused feelings of resentment in the Pueblo 
Indians and led in 1680 to a general revolt, headed by a native 
named Pope. Over 400 Spaniards were massacred, and the 
remnant, "after enduring a siege in Santa Fe, fled southward 
to a mission near the present El Paso. For a decade the natives 
enjoyed their independence, destroying nearly all vestiges of 
Spanish occupation, and venting their wrath particularly upon the 
ehurches. After several attempts at reconquest had failed, Don 
Diego de Vargas marched up the Rio Grande in 1692, and 
largely by moral suasion secured the surrender of Santa F6, 
then held by the Indians. During the next four years the sub- 
mission of all the pueblos was secured, and the permanency of 

	1 Although the Quivfra story was fabricated by an Indian captive 
	and its fraudulent character was fully exposed by Coronado in 1541, 
	ignorant American treasure-seekers still search for this mythical 
	region. By a strange perversion of names the deserted stone pueblo 
	of Tabira, S. of Albuquerque in the vicinity of the Manzano Moun- 
	tains, has received the appellation of " Gran Quivfra," thereby 
	causing many deluded persons to make a vain search among its 
	ruins for treasure. 

European occupation was assured. The history of New Mexico 
in the 18th century was uneventful, being chiefly a story of petty 
disagreements among the pueblos, and occasional forays of the 
more warlike tribes, the Navahos, Apaches and Comanches. 
During the Mexican War of Independence (1811-21) New 
Mexico was tranquil and little disturbed by events farther south; 
but when, near the close of the year 182 1, the news of independ- 
ence arrived it was received with enthusiasm. Under the Mexican 
republic New Mexico was called a province till 1824, when it was 
united with Chihuahua and Durango to form the Estado Interno 
del Norte. Several months later, however, it was separated from 
these two provinces and became a Territory; in 1836 it was 
oflicially designated as a department, and remained as such until 
ceded to the United States by the treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo, 
in 1848. Its government during this period was only slightly 
changed from what it had been under Spain. • 

Of great importance to New Mexico during the first half of the 
19th century was the development of its trade with the United 
States. American traders had occasionally ventured as far as 
Santa Fe before the independence of Mexico, but they were 
frequently expelled and their goods confiscated by the Spanish 
authorities. After 1822 trading expeditions became larger and 
more numerous. From Missouri caravans of pack animals, and 
later wagon trains, set out in May of each year on the 800 m. 
journey to Santa Fe, along the route later followed in its general 
lines by the Atchison, Topeka & Santa Fe railway. The value 
of the products carried by these trains increased from $r5,ooo 
in 1822 to $450,000 in 1843. O n tne * r return trip the wagons 
often brought loads of wool, fur and blankets. 

In 1841 the republic of Texas, claiming that its western 
boundary was the Rio Grande, sent a force of 300 men to New 
Mexico to enforce these claims. The Texans reached the frontier 
in a starved and exhausted condition, were made prisoners by the 
New Mexican militia, and were sent to Mexico, where after a short 
term of confinement they were released. 

In 1846 the Congress of the United States declared that war 
existed with Mexico, and on the 3rd of June Brigadier-General 
Stephen W. Kearny was ordered to undertake the conquest of 
New Mexico and California and to " establish temporary civil 
governments therein." Kearny reached Las Vegas on the 15th 
of August, assured the people of protection if they remained 
peaceable, and three days later entered Santa Fe without opposi- 
tion. Here he organized a civil government and compiled a code 
of laws, some of which are still in force, thus exceeding his 
instructions and ignoring the territorial claims of Texas, out 
of which had grown the war. After Kearny's departure for 
California and Col. Alexander William Doniphan's (1808-1887) 
setting out (Dec. 1846) on his heroic expedition to join. Gen. 
Wool at Chihuahua, some of the inhabitants revolted, and in 
January 1847 assassinated the governor, Charles Bent, and a 
number of Americans and Mexicans who had taken office under 
the new regime. The insurrection was quickly suppressed, but 
the citizens soon grew tired of a military government, and in 
1848 and again in 1849 petitioned Congress for a government 
" purely civil in character." In 1850 a convention met in Santa 
Fe and drafted a state constitution prohibiting slavery; this 
constitution was ratified, and state officials were chosen to act 
under it. The governor by military appointment, Colonel John 
Munroe (1 796-1861), refused to surrender his jurisdiction in 
favour of the state officials until authorized to do so by 
Congress, and for a time there was much writing of pronuncia- 
mentos by the military and the quasi-state officials. But finally a 
regular Territorial form of government, provided by Congress by 
an act of the 13th of December 1850 (a part of the Compromise 
of 1850), was formally inaugurated on the 3rd of March 185 1. 

As originally constituted, the Territory included, besides most 
of its present area, nearly all of what is now Arizona, and a small 
portion of the present Colorado. By the terms of the Compromise 
Measures of 1850 Texas surrendered all claims to the portion of 
New Mexico E. of the Rio Grande, and was reimbursed for this 
loss of territory by the Federal Government. The Gadsden 
Purchase (see Gadsden, James), [concluded on the 30th of 
December 1853, and proclaimed by President Pierce on the 30th 
of June 1854, added to the Territory an area of 45,535 sq. m., 
and changed the southern boundary W. of the Rio Grande so 
that from the Rio Grande the new boundary ran due W. on the 
parallel of 31 47' N. lat. for 100 m., then due S. to the parallel 
of 31 20' N. lat., then due W. on that parallel to its intersection 
with the inth meridian of longitude west of Greenwich, from 
that point of intersection in a straight line to the Colorado 
river, 20 m. below its junction with the Gila, and thence up the 
middle of the Colorado river to the boundary line between 
Mexico and California. In 1861 a portion of north-eastern New 
Mexico was taken to form part of Colorado; and in 1863 all 
of the area \V. of the 109th meridian was organized as the 
separate Territory of Arizona. 

By the Compromise of 1850 the question whether New Mexico 
should have slavery was left to the decision of the inhabitants. 
Only a few African slaves were ever brought into the Territory, 
and these were usually the property of civil and military officers. 
There were two classes of the population, however, whose status 
was practically that of slaves; namely, Indian captives and peons. 
Before slavery was prohibited in the Territory by Act of Congress 
in 1862, Indian captives were regularly bought and sold, a traffic 
sanctioned b^ custom and not prohibited by law. Peons were 
persons held in servitude on account o( debt, and the peonage 
system was sanctioned both by the custom of the Mexican provinces 
and by the laws of the Territory. An act of 1851 forbade servants 
from leaving masters to whom they were indebted, and in 1853 
sheriffs were authorized in some instances to dispose of the debtor's 
labour to the highest bidder. Peonage remained a legalized in- 
stitution until 1867, when it was prohibited by an act of Congress. 

At the outbreak of the Civil War the inhabitants were generally 
apathetic; but when the Confederates invaded New Mexico 
they proved loyal to the Union. 1 In February 1862 General 
H. H. Sibley, commanding a force of about 3800 Texans, marched 
into New Mexico, fought a successful engagement at Valverde, 
on the Rio Grande, against Union forces under Colonel, later 
General, Edward R. S. Canby, and occupied Albuquerque and 
Santa Fe. The Union troops were reinforced from Colorado, 
however, and after a series of skirmishes the Confederates were 
compelled to retreat to Texas, leaving behind about half their 
original number in killed, wounded and missing. New Mexico 
furnished to the Union army between 5000 and 6000 men.

The period following the American occupation of New Mexico 
was marked by constant depredations of the Indians, chiefly the 
Navahos, Apaches and a few Utes, their main object being 
plunder. While the troops were occupied with the Confederate 
invaders the Indians had a free hand, but in 1863 an energetic 
campaign was begun by General James H. Carleton against the 
Navahos, who were subdued and placed on a reservation on the 
Pecos river, and later removed to the north-western part of the 
Territory. There they grew peaceful and prosperous, acquiring 
large flocks of sheep and gaining a reputation as makers of 
blankets. The Apache Indians, the most savage of all, were 
placed on reservations somewhat later, but for many years bands 
of their warriors would escape and make raids into New Mexico, 
Arizona and Mexico. The most notable of the later outbreaks 
were those in 1870-1880 and in 1 885-1886 respectively of the 
Apache chiefs Victorio and Geronimo (c. 1834-1909). 

When the United States acquired possession of New Mexico, the 
best portions of the Territory were held in private ownership under 
Spanish and Mexican grants, which were confirmed by the treaty of 
Guadalupe-Hidalgo. To determine the validity of these claims, 
which had been complicated by transfers and subdivisions, and to 
fix their boundaries, which were often very vaguely described, 
proved a very formidable undertaking; and the slow process of 
confirmation greatly retarded the development of the Territory. 
There was but little material progress before the advent of the rail- 
way. The Atchison, Topcka & Santa Fe railway reached Albu- 
querque in 1880, and the Southern Pacific railway effected a junction 
with it at Deming in 1881, thus connecting the Territory with the 
eastern and western coasts of the United States. With the railway 
came capital and the development of mines, great cattle ranges and 
modern towns. Immigrants from the states, however, rarely 

	1 According to the historian H. H. Bancroft, the loyalty to the 
	Union cause resulted " largely from the fact that the Confederate 
	invasion came from Texas, the old hatred of the Texans being the 
	strongest popular feeling of the natives, far outweighing their de- 
	votion to either the North or the South." 

settled beyond the zone of the railway, and in the remote rural 
regions the process of Americanization was slow. 

After the Civil War numerous attempts were made to secure 
the admission of New Mexico into the Union as a state. In 1872 
a state constitution was drafted, and it was proposed for a time 
to call the new state Lincoln, but the movement came to nothing. 
In 1889 another constitution was drafted, but it was rejected 
when submitted to a popular vote. On the 6th of November 
1906 the question of the joint admission of New Mexico and 
Arizona as a single state bearing the name of the latter Territory 
was submitted to a vote of their citizens. The vote of New Mexico 
was favourable (26,195 t0 *4i735)> but the measure was defeated 
in Arizona. In June 1910 the President approved an enabling 
act providing for the admission of Arizona and New Mexico as 
separate states.

NEW MILLS, an urban district in the High Peak parlia- 
mentary division of Derbyshire, England, at the confluence of the 
rivers Goyt and Kinder, on the border of Cheshire, 13 m. 
S.E. of Manchester, on the Midland and the London & North- 
western railways. Pop. (1901) 7773. Its ancient name was 
Bowden Middle Cale. The name of New Mills was given to it 
from a corn-mill erected on the Kinder in the hamlet of Ollersett, 
and is specially applied to the group of factories which have 
grown up round it. Formerly paper and cloth were the staple 
industries of the district, but the inhabitants of the various 
hamlets are now occupied chiefly in iron and brass foundries, 
cotton mills and print-works. A short branch of the Midland 
railway leads to the town of Hayfield (pop. 2614). 


NEWMILNS, a manufacturing town and police burgh of 
Ayrshire, Scotland. Pop. (1901) 4467. It is situated 7! m. 
E. of Kilmarnock by the Glasgow and South- Western railway. 
It was made a burgh of barony in 1490 by James IV., the charter 
being confirmed in 1566 by Sir Matthew Campbell, the laird of 
Loudoun, in which parish the town is situated. Muslin- and 
lace-curtain making and the manufacture of mosquito-nets are 
the chief industries. Nearly 2 m. E. lies Darvel (pop. 3070), a 
police burgh and manufacturing town, with a statioD on the 
Glasgow and South-Western railway; its chief manufactures 
are those of lace curtains, muslins and carpets. Two miles E. 
rises Loudoun Hill (1036 ft.) where Robert Bruce defeated the 
English in 1307, and about a mile farther E. is the cairn raised 
to commemorate one of Wallace's victories. 


NEW ORLEANS, a city of Louisiana, U.S.A., situated almost 
wholly on the left bank of the Mississippi, 107 m. from its mouth, 
in that portion of the state which constitutes the river's larger 
delta, and lying between Lake Pontchartrain (to the north and 
west) and Lake Borgne (to the east and south); its latitude 
is about 30 , nearly the same as that of Cairo, Egypt. Pop. 
(1910) 339,075. The city lay originally at the angle of a deep 
three-sided bend in the river. Into this hollow it gradually 
spread, the curving river front, some 9 m. long, serving as its 
harbour; and hence its old appellation, the Crescent City. 
Long ago, however, the city filled the pocket of the bend, and 
spreading farther along the river, now has the form of an " S." 
Directly north, and still about 3 m. distant from the parts of the 
city proper that have advanced farthest toward it, lies Lake 
Pontchartrain (about 40 m. long and 20 m. wide). Lake and 
river are parallel to one another for many miles; the city lies 
on the narrow alluvial strip between. The total area included 
within the municipal limits is 196-25 sq. m., but the city proper 
covers about 40 sq. m. The larger limits are coextensive with 
those of the parish of Orleans, and include the district of Algiers, 
on the right bank of the Mississippi. 

The river at New Orleans varies from 1500 to 3000 ft. in width, 
and its broad channel often stretches almost from shore to shore, 
with a depth varying frequently at short intervals from 40 ft. 
to' more than 200 ft. Around the margins a line of wharves 
and shipping extends for miles on each shore. Including the 
suburbs of Westwego, Gretna, &c, on the right bank of the 
stream, there is a river frontage of more than 20 m. Gretna, 
the seat of Jefferson parish, McDonoghville, in Jefferson parish, 
and Algiers, or West New Orleans, a part of the city, are in- 
dustrial suburbs on the west bank of the Mississippi, connected 
with the east bank by a steam ferry and with one another by 
electric railway. At Algiers are railway terminals and repair 
shops of the Southern Pacific and the Texas & Pacific; and the 
United States Naval Station here, which was built in 1894 
(though land was bought for it in 1849), and has a large steel 
floating dry dock, is the only fresh-water station south of Ports- 
mouth, Virginia, and is equipped to make all repairs. 

The city site is almost perfectly level; there is an exceedingly 
slight slope from the river toward the tidal morasses that border 
Lake Pontchartrain. . The elevation of the city plain is only 
10 ft. above the sea, and its lower parts are as much as 10-12 ft. 
below the Mississippi at high flood water. About 6 m. of heavy 
" levees " or dykes — in some parts rising clear above the city 
plain, but backed by filled-in areas graded down from the shores 
where the traffic of the water-front is concentrated — protect 
it from the waters. The speed of the current reaches, in times, 
of high water, a rate of 5 m. an hour. Along the immediate 
front of the principal commercial quarter, this current, losing 
some of its force by change of direction, deposits its alluvium in 
such quantities as to produce a constant encroachment of the 
shore upon the harbour. At its widest part this new land or 
batture, with wharves, streets and warehouses following eagerly 
after it, has advanced some 1500 ft. beyond the water-line of the 
middle of the 18th century. 

The climate is not marked by extremes of absolute heat or 
cold. Only once in thirty-seven years (187 1- 1907) did the 
thermometer register as high as 102 F., and on only a few days 
did it register above 96 ; in February 1899 the temperature 
was 7 , but it rarely falls below 22 . The average annual 
rainfall is about 58 in. 

Canal Street, the centre of retail trade and street life, bounds 
on the south-west near the river the Vieux Carre — the old rect- 
angle within the walls of the original city, bounded by the river, 
Canal, Rampart and Esplanade streets — and separates the 
picturesque, peaceful French (or Latin) Quarter of the north- 
east from the bustling business and dignified residence districts 
of the American Quarter, or New City, on the south-west. In 
the latter St Charles Avenue and Prytania Street have the finest 
residences, and in the former Esplanade Avenue. Just below 
Canal Street, in the oldest part of the American Quarter, are 
many of the most important or imposing buildings of the city, 
and some of the places most intimately associated with its history. 
Here are the St Charles Hotel (1894), the third of that name on 
the present site, all famous hostelries, and the first (1838-1851) 
one of the earliest of the great hotels of the country; and Lafayette 
Square, surrounded by the City Hall (built in 1850 in the style 
of an Ionic temple), the new Post Office, two handsome churches, 
St Patrick's and the First Presbyterian, Odd Fellows' Hall 
and other buildings. In the square are statues of Henry Clay 
(by Joel T. Hart) and Franklin (by Hiram Powers), and a 
monument to John McDonogh (1898); and in the vicinity are 
the Howard Memorial Library (1887; a memorial to Charles T. 
Howard), which was the last work of H. H. Richardson, a native 
of Louisiana, and the Confederate Memorial Hall (presented to 
the city by F. T. Howard) with Confederate relics. Two blocks 
away in Marguerite Place is a statue erected (1884) by the women 
of the city to Margaret Haughery (d. 1882) , the " Orphan's Friend," 
a noble woman of humble birth and circumstances, who devoted 
a toilful but successful life to charities. In Lee Circle is a monu- 
ment to Robert E. Lee, and facing it is the New Orleans Public 
Library building (1908). Just off Canal Street, at Carondelet 
and Gravier Street, is the Cotton Exchange (1882-1883), and in 
Magazine Street the Produce Exchange. The large office buildings 
are on Canal, Carondelet, Common and Gravier streets; among 
them may be mentioned the Maison Blanche, the Hennen 
Building, theTulaneNewcomb Building and the Canal Louisiana 
Bank and Trust Company Building. On Camp Street, between 
Gravier and Poydras, are the office buildings of the Picayune and 
the Times- Democrat; on Carondelet and Gravier are the wholesale 
I cotton houses; on Poydras and Tchoupitoulas are the wholesale 
grocery houses; and on North Peters and Custom House streets 
the sugar and rice industries are concentrated. Little of history 
or tradition is associated with the American Quarter, with the 
exception of the former site (before 190c) of the Clay statue in 
Canal Street where Royal Street and St Charles Avenue begin, 
which was the scene of popular meetings in the Italian troubles 
of 1 891; here, in Liberty Place, a triangle at the intersection 
of Canal, North Peters and Tchoupitoulas streets, on the scene 
of the fight of the 14th of September 1874 between conservative 
citizens and the radical authorities of the state, is a granite 
memorial called the Liberty Monument. The Customs House, 
long renowned for its " marble room," is in the old city, just off 
Canal Street. The corner-stone was laid by Henry Clay in 1847. 
The Boston (1845) and Pickwick (1857) are the best known of the 
general social clubs, and the Harmony (1862) of the Jewish clubs. 
It is the French Quarter in which the history, poetry and 
romance of New Orleans are indissolubly united. The memory 
of French dominion is retained in the titles, and in the foreign 
aspect as well, of Toulouse, Orleans, Du Maine, Conti, Bourbon, 
Dauphin6 and Chartres streets; while even more distinctly 
the Spaniard has superimposed his impress on stuccoed wall 
and iron lattice, huge locks and hinges, arches and gratings, 
balconies, jalousies, inner courts with parterres, urns and basins 
with fountains, and statues half hid in roses and vines. There 
are streets named from its Spanish governors: Unzaga, Galvez, 
Miro, Salcedo, Casa Calvo, Carondelet and the baron Caron- 
delet's Baronne. The moated and palisaded boundaries of early 
days are indicated by the wide, tree-planted and grassy avenues 
named respectively from the Canal, the Rampart and the 
"Esplanade that once lay along their course; the original 
*' commons " outside the walls are commemorated in Common 
Street; and the old parade ground in the midst of the early 
town's river front, now laid off in flower-beds, white-shelled 
walks and shaven shrubbery, and known as Jackson Square, 
still retains its older name of the Place d'Armes. With this 
quaint, sunny and dusty old square is associated nearly every 
important event in Louisiana's colonial history. This was the 
place publique, associated with traffic, gossip, military muster and 
official acts of state. On one side is the cathedral of St Louis, 
first built in 1718, burned in 1788, rebuilt in 1792-1794, and 
largely rebuilt again in 1850. Flanking the cathedral on one 
side stands the calaboose {Calaboza, 1810), and on the other the 
Cabildo — so named from the municipal council that sat here 
under Spanish rule, when it was the government house and palace 
of justice. Both buildings are to-day used as law courts. The 
Cabildo is a dignified two-storey structure of adobe and shell- 
lime, built in 1795; an incongruous mansard roof was added in 
1850. On the 30th of November 1803, in the council hall, the 
city keys were handed back to the representatives of the French 
government and the people of Louisiana were absolved from 
their allegiance to the Spanish king; and here, only twenty days 
afterward, with similar ceremonies, the keys of the city passed 
from the hands of the French colonial prefect to those of the 
commissioners for the United States. In the old Place d'Armes 
a bronze equestrian statue (1846) of Andrew Jackson by Clark 
Mills is a remembrance of the ceremonies attending Jackson's 
triumphal entry into the city after the battle of New Orleans in 
1815. In 1825 Lafayette was lodged in the Cabildo as the city's 
guest. 

The appearance of the square was greatly changed in 1849, 
when the Baroness de Pontalba, in whose estate it was then 
comprised, cut down the ancient elms that shaded it and laid 
it out in its present style of a French garden. She also is re- 
sponsible for the low brick " Pontalba Mansions " on the north 
and south sides of the square. The Babel of Tongues in the 
French Market (1813), on thesiteof an oldermarket, immediately 
below Jackson Square, and at the" Picayune Tier "just adjacent, 
is an interesting feature of the city. Near the Cathedral, in 
Orleans Street, is the convent of the Holy Family, a brick building 
housing a negro sisterhood founded in 1835, and formerly the 
scene of New Orleans's famous " quadroon balls." The archi- 
episcopal palace (1730), said to be the oldest building of the 
Mississippi Valley, is part of the unchanged original Ursuline 
convent; it was used as the State Capitol in 183 1, and then it 
was the residence, and since 1899 nas Deen tDe administrative 
office of the archbishop, and houses a colonial museum with the 
ecclesiastical records. The French Opera House (i860) was the 
successor of various French theatres built after 1808. The 
carnival balls are given here. New Orleans was by far the earliest 
of American cities to have an annual opera season. 

The 18th-century fortifications about the old city were 
destroyed about 1804. The United States Branch Mint (1838) 
occupies the site of Fort St Charles (destroyed 1826), where 
Jackson reviewed his troops as they marched to Chalmette. 
Just outside the Vieux Carre* is Beauregard Square, formerly 
known as Congo Square, because in early days the slaves were 
wont to gather here for their barbaric dances. The Hotel St 
Louis (1836), rebuilt in 1884 as the Hotel Royal, was the seat 
of the Republican reconstruction governments of governors 
Kellogg and Packard, and the prison fortressof both, respectively 
in 1874 and 1877, when the whites rose against Republican rule; 
its rotunda was also once a famous slave mart. Many other 
spots in the Latin Quarter are of scarcely less interest than those 
mentioned, not excluding those which were made famous by 
the romances of G. W. Cable, and whose only title to historic 
consideration is that which his imagination has given them. 

City Park (216*6 acre's, partly water), lying between the city 
and the lake, is notable in the local duelling annals of earlier days. 
Audubon Park (249 acres) was once the sugar plantation of 
fitienne de Bore, who first successfully made granulated sugar 
in 1 795-1 796; earlier experiments had been made in 1791 by 
Antonio Mendes, from whom de Bore, who established the sugar 
industry, bought a plantation in St Bernard Parish. The park 
was bought by the city for $180,000 in 1871, but was little 
improved until 1884, when the Cotton Centennial Exposition was 
held here. It contains to-day a state Sugar Experiment Station, 
in which a part of their work in course is done by the students in 
the Audubon Sugar School of the State University at Baton 
Rouge, and Horticultural Hall, the only one of the Exposition 
buildings now standing, with a display of tropical trees and 
plants; opposite Audubon Park is the campus of Tulane 
University. West End is a suburban resort and residential 
district on Lake Pontchartrain. 

A noted feature of New Orleans is its cemeteries. Owing to 
the undrained condition of the subsoil, burials are made entirely 
above ground, in tombs of stuccoed brick and of granite and 
marble. Some of these are very elegant and costly, and many of 
the burial-grounds, with their long alleys of these tombs of diverse 
designs, deeply shaded by avenues of cedars and magnolias, 
possess a severe but emphatic beauty. Jews and the poor bury 
their dead underground in shallow graves. The oldest cemetery, 
St Louis No. 1, contains the graves of many persons notable 
in history. St Roch's Campo Santo has a wonder-working shrine, 
and is the most picturesque of the old burying-grounds. Mctairie, 
on the site of an old race track, is the finest of the new. It con- 
tains a monument 1 to the Army of the Tennessee and its com- 
mander, Albert Sidney Johnston, with an equestrian statue of 
Johnston by Alexander Doyle, and a monument to the Army of 
Northern Virginia surmounted by a statue of General T. J. 
Jackson. In Greenwood Cemetery is the first monument erected 
to Confederate dead, given by the women of New Orleans. 
At Chalmette (on the Mississippi, about 5 m. E. of Canal Street), 
where the battle of New Orleans was fought in 1815, there is a 
National Cemetery, in which some 12,000 Union soldiers in the 
Civil War are buried. 

Population. — The population in 1900 2 was 287,104, New 

	[1] In the burial vault of this tomb, with the bodies of many other 
	soldiers, are the remains of General P. G. T. Beauregard, who was 
	born near New Orleans. 

	[2] At the earlier censuses the population of the city was as follows: 
	17,242 in 1810 (when it was the sixth city in population in the 
	United States); 27,176 in 1820 (when, as in 1830 and 1850, it was 
	the fifth city); 46,082 in 1830; not reported separately in 1840; 
	116,375 in 1850; 168,675 in i860; 191,418 in 1870; 216,090 in 
	1880; and 242,039 in 1890. 

Orleans ranking twelfth among the cities of the United States; 
in 1910 it was 339,075. Of the 1900 total, 256,779 were native- 
born, and 30,325 were foreign-born, including 8733 Germans, 
5866 Italians, 5398 Irish, 4428 French and 1262 English; and 
there were 77,714 negroes. In 1900 the population of foreign 
parentage was 108,010, of whom 78,269 had foreign fathers and 
foreign mothers, 27,259 being of German, 15,465 of Irish, 10,694 of 
Italian, 931 7 of French and 1882 of English parentage. The Latin 
element that came in colonial times included Frenchmen, French- 
Canadians, colonists from the French and Spanish West Indies, 
Canary Islanders (whose descendants are still known as Islefios), 
and French refugees from Acadia in 1765 and the years following, 
and from Santo Domingo at the end of the 18th century. The 
earliest French immigrants were largely Bretons and Normans, 
and various Creole words in common use (such as banquette for 
" side-walk ") still recall these racial beginnings. The Creoles 
of New Orleans and the surrounding delta are a handsome, 
graceful, intelligent race, of a decidedly Gallic type, though 
softened in features, speech and carriage. Their dialect has been 
formed from the French entirely by sound, has no established 
orthography, and is of # much philological interest. Until very 
recent years the Latin races, though fusing somewhat among 
themselves, mixed little in blood with the Anglo-American. The 
Spaniards when in power at the end of the 18th century were 
notably different from the French in their liberalism in this 
respect. In social life and standards the French Creoles were 
very conservative; the old styles of dress, e.g. of the late 18th 
century — wigs, silk stockings and knee-breeches — lingered later 
among them, probably, than in any other part of the country. 
But before the pressure of Anglo-American immigration, capital, 
enterprise and education, this Creole civilization has slowly 
yielded ground, at last fairly beginning to amalgamate with the 
social system of the American nation. But the Creole has 
stamped his influence upon wellnigh every aspect in the life 
of the city that has broadened out so widely on every side of his 
antique town. Its cuisine, its speech, its " continental " Latin 
Sundays, its opera, its carnival, its general fashions and manners, 
its intolerance of all sorts of rigour, its whole outward tone and 
bearing, testify to this patent Latin impress. A comparatively 
recent addition to the Latin element in the city has been through 
Italian immigration. 

The coloured population, notwithstanding the presence among 
it of that noted quadroon class which enjoyed a certain legal 
freedom for generations before the Civil War, has not greatly 
improved since the date of emancipation. Catholicism is naturally 
extremely strong in New Orleans. So also are the Baptist and 
Methodist churches. 

Carnivals. — The famous carnival displays of New Orleans 
are participated in very largely by the " Americain," i.e. the 
Anglo-American; but they mark one of the victories of the 
La tin- American over North- American tastes, and probably owe 
mainly to the " Americain " their pretentious dignity and to 
the Creole their more legitimate harlequin frivolity. Out of the 
simple idea of masked revelry in the open streets, as borrowed 
from Italian cities, the American bent for organization appears 
to have developed, by a natural growth, the costly fashion of 
gorgeous torch-lighted processions of elaborately equipped 
masques in tableaux drawn on immense cars by teams of 
caparisoned mules, and combining to illustrate in a symmetrical 
whole some theme chosen from the great faiths or literatures or 
from history. Legends, fairy-tales, mythologies and theologies, 
literature from Homer to Shakespeare, science and pure fantasy 
are drawn upon for these ornate representations, which are 
accompanied by all the picturesque licence of street life char- 
acteristic of carnival times in other cities. They have no rival 
in America, and for glitter, colour and elaborateness are by many 
esteemed the most splendid carnival celebrations of the world. 
The first carnival parade (as distinguished from the Mardi Gras 
celebration) was held in 1827 by masked students recently 
returned from Paris. In 1837 and 1839 the first processions 
with " floats " were held in New Orleans. The regular annual 
pageants, almost uninterrupted save during the Civil War, date 
from 1857, when the " Mystic Krewe of Comus," the oldest of 
the carnival organizations, was formed; similar organizations, 
secret societies or clubs are the " Twelfth Knight Revelers " 
(1870), " Rex " and " Knights of Momus " (both 1872, when 
the carnival was reviewed by the Grand Duke Alexis of Russia), 
the " Krewe of Proteus " (1882), and the " Krewe of Nereus " 
(1895). Balls, processions and other festivities are now spread 
over a considerable period, culminating in those of Shrove 
Tuesday (Mardi Gras). During this time the festivities quite 
engross public attention, and many thousands of visitors from all 
parts of America are yearly attracted to the city. 

Charitable Institutions. — The large Charity Hospital (1786) and the 
Richard Milliken Memorial Hospital for Children are supported by 
the state. The Touro Infirmary (1854; controlled by the Hebrew 
Benevolent Association; founded by Judah Touro (1 775-1854; a 
Jew of Dutch descent, son of Isaac Touro of Newport, Rhode Island), 
includes a free clinic open to the needy of all faiths. Other hospitals 
are: the U.S. Marine Hospital (1885); the H6tel Dieu (1859) and 
the St Joseph's Maternity Hospital (1863), both under the Sisters 
of Charity; the Sarah Goodrich Hospital (1896; Methodist Epis- 
copal) ; and the Eye, Ear, Nose and Throat Hospital (1889; private). 
The Poydras Asylum, on Magazine Street, was founded in 1817 by 
Julien Poydras (1 746-1 824), a successful trader and delegate from 
Orleans Territory to the Federal Congress in 1 809-1 81 1 ; the present 
building was erected in 1836; the asylum, which is for orphans, 
is controlled by Presbyterian trustees, although it was, during 
Poydras's life, under the charge of Sisters of Charity. St Vincent's 
Infant Asylum (1858), or " Margaret's Baby House," is in charge of 
Sisters of Charity. Other orphanages and children's homes are: 
the New Orleans Female Orphan Asylum (1849) and St Elizabeth's. 
Industrial School (1845), under the Sisters of Charity; an Ursuline 
Orphanage (1729); the Immaculate Conception Girls' Asylum (1851) 
and St Mary's Catholic Orphan Boys' Asylum (1835, under the 
Sisters Marianites of the Holy Cross); the St Alphonsus Orphan* 
Asylum (1878) and St Vincent s Home for Newsboys (1878), under 
the Sisters of Mercy; the Mount Carmel Orphan Asylum (1869), 
under the Sisters of Mount Carmel; the Sacred Heart Orphan Asylum 
(1894) for girls, under the Missionary Sisters of the Sacred Heart; 
St Joseph's Orphan Asylum (1863), under the Sisters of Notre Dame; 
a Protestant Orphans' Home (1853); a Jewish Orphans' Home 
(1855); the Children's Home of the Protestant Episcopal Church 
6859); the Evangelical Lutheran Bethlehem Orphan Asylum (1881); 
the German Protestant Orphan Asylum (1866); the Freedmen's 
Orphan Asylum (Baptist); and, under private and non-sectarian 
control, the Asylum for Destitute Orphan Boys (1824) and the 
Colored Industrial^ Home and School (1902). The J. D. Fink 
Fund and the Fink Home (1874) or Asylum (for Protestant 
widows and their children) are the gift of an eccentric, whose offer 
of marriage had been refused by one preferring not to marry at all, 
and who forbade that any old maid should enter the asylum. Other 
homes for adults are : the Soldiers* Home of Louisiana for Con- 
federate Veterans; two Homes for the Aged (1869 and 1882), both 
under the Little Sisters of the Poor; the Faith Home (1888; Baptist) 
for old coloured women; the German Protestant Bethany Home 
(1889) and the German Protestant Home for the Aged and Infirm 
(1887) ; the Julius Weis Home for Aged and Infirm (1899), under the 
Hebrew Benevolent Association; and, all under private corpora- 
tions, the Maison Hospitaliere (1893) for aged women, the New 
Orleans Home for Incurables (1893) and St Anna's Asylum (1850) 
for destitute women and their children. Temporary homes are: 
the Convent of the Good Shepherd (1859), under the Sisters of the 
Good Shepherd, and a Memorial Home (1886; both for wayward 
women) ; a Home for Homeless Women (i888) t> and the New Orleans 
Convalescent Home (1885). Kingsley House is modelled after Hull 
House in Chicago. The Louisiana Retreat, a private asylum for the 
insane, is in New Orleans, and there also is a state House of Detention. 

Education, — The public schools give equal opportunities to whites 
and blacks, but the whites take decidedly greater advantage of 
them; a large number even of the whites still make practically 
no use of either public or parochial schools. The races are kept 
separate: the attempt was made to mix attendance in 1870, but the 
whites compelled its abandonment. To a bequest of John McDonogh 
(1778-1850), whose life is one of the romances and the lessons of 
New Orleans, 1 the city owes already some thirty school buildings. 
The Home Institute (1883) provides free night schooling for hundreds, 
of students, and similar work is done on a larger scale by public 
night schools. Of the adult male population in 1900 13-4 % were 
illiterate (could not write), seven-tenths of the illiterates being 
negroes, of whom the illiterates constituted 36 %. 

There are various higher institutions of learning in the city. 
Tulane University of Louisiana was named after its benefactor Paul 
Tulane (1 801-1887), a merchant of New Orleans, who gave $1,050,000 
in 1 882-1 887 to a Board of Trustees for the education of " the white 
young persons in the city.** The university was established, under 

	1 See William Allan's Life and Work of John McDonogh (Baltimore, 
	1886). 

its present name, in 1884, the former university of Louisiana (1834) 
being merged in it; it gives free tuition in the academic department 
to one student from each senatorial and each representative district 
or parish in the state, and its income-producing property, up to 
$5,000,000, is exempted from taxation by the state. In 1908-1909 
Tulane University had 192 instructors and 2236 students; and it 
included a Graduate. Department, a College of Arts and Sciences 
(1884), a College of Technology with 157 students, Extension Courses 
with 148 students, the H. Sophie Newcomb Memorial College for 
Girls (1886; endowed in memory of her only daughter by Josephine 
Louise, wife of Warren Newcomb, a sugar merchant of the city), 
with 288 students in the college and 102 in Newcomb High School, 
a Teachers' College, a Law Department (1847), a Medical Depart- 
ment (1834) with 648 students, a Department of Pharmacy and a 
Summer School with 860 students. The College of the Immaculate 
Conception (Jesuit, 1847) is an important school. Higher schools for 
the negroes include Leland University (1870; Baptist), with college 
courses, preparatory courses (there are several Baptist secondary 
schools affiliated with the university), normal and manual training 
departments, a school of music, a theological school, a woman's 
Christian Workers' Class and a night school; Straight University 
(1870; Congregational), with kindergarten, primary, high school and 
industrial departments; New Orleans University (1873; Methodist) 
and Southern University (1883). The last is supported by the state. 

Libraries. — The public, society and school libraries in the city in 
1909, many being very small, aggregated 301,000 votoi£S./*s 227,000 
being in five collections. A central library building and three branch 
buildings, costing $275,000, were presented to the city by Andrew 
Carnegie- The Howard Memorial Library (1887) is an important 
reference library, peculiarly rich in books on the history of Louisiana. 
The Louisiana Historical Society (1836) and the Athenee Louisian- 
naise (1876) may also be mentioned; the latter has for its purpose 
the conservation and cultivation of the French language. The Union 
Franchaise (1872) supplements with educational t and charitable 
activities the general bond of fraternity offered by it to the French 
population. In New Orleans there is a State Museum, devoted to 
the history, institutions and resources of the state. 

Newspapers. — Among the older newspapers are VAbeille (1827) 
and the Picayune (1837), which is one of the most famous and in- 
fluential papers of the South, and was founded by George Wilkins 
Kendall (1809- 1867), a native of New Hampshire, who organized 
a special military correspondence for his paper during the Mexican 
War, probably the earliest instance of such service in the United 
States. The Times-Democrat (1863) is counted among the ablest 
and most energetic papers of the South. De Bow's Commercial 
Review (published in New Orleans 1 846-1 864), founded and edited 
by James D. B. De Bow (1820-1867), was in its day one of the most 
important periodicals of the country, and remains a valuable re- 
pository of information on conditions in the South before the war. 

Commerce. — It was its potential commercial value, as indicated 
by its geographical position, that in 1803, when New Orleans was 
only a small, poor and remote Franco-Spanish-American port, 
led to its purchase by the United States. But various causes 
operated to impede the city's growth: the invention of railway 
transit, the development of the carrying trade on the Great 
Lakes, the bars at the mouth of the Mississippi, over which few 
large ships could pass, the scourge of yellow fever, the pro- 
vincialism and the lethargy of an isolated and indolent civiliza- 
tion. Slavery kept away free labour, and the plantation 
system fostered that " improvidence and that feudal self-com- 
placency which looked with indolent contempt upon public 
co-operative measures" (G. W. Cable). However, in i860 the 
exports, imports and domestic receipts of New Orleans aggre- 
gated $324,000,000. As a result of the Civil War the commerce 
of New Orleans experienced an early paralysis; the port was 
soon blockaded by the United States navy; the city fell into 
the hands of the Federal forces (1st May 1862); its commerce 
with the interior was practically annihilated until after 1865, 
and from the depression of the years following the war the city 
did not fully recover for a quarter of a century. Only after 
1880 did its total commerce again equal that of i860. It was 
almost solely as the dispenser of the products of the greatest 
agricultural valley in the world that New Orleans grew from a 
little frontier town to the dimensions of a great city. This trade 
is still dominant in the city's commerce. In the season that 
follows the harvest of the South and West, the levee, the wharves 
and the contiguous streets are gorged with the raw staples of 
the regions that lie about the Mississippi and its greater and 
lesser tributaries — sugar, molasses, rice, tobacco, Indian corn, 
pork, staves, wheat, oats, flour and, above all else, from one- 
fourth to one-third the country's entire supply of cotton. All 
other movement is subsidiary or insignificant. 

By 1 000 the drawbacks which have been enumerated had been 
practically eliminated, and uncertainty as to the investment of 
capital had been removed. The southward tendency in railway 
traffic favours the city. Deep water to the ocean was secured by 
a system of jetties at the South Pass mouth of the Mississippi, 
built by James B. Eads in 1875-1879; but in time this ceased 
to maintain an adequate depth of water, and (after the report 
in 1900 of a board of engineers) in 1902 Congress began appro- 
priations for an improvement of the South-west Pass 1 by 
opening a channel 1000 ft. wide and at least 35 ft. deep. Many 
lines of steamers give direct connexion with the West Indies, 
Central America, Europe, New York and also with Japan (for 
the shipment of raw cotton via Suez). Ocean steamers, loaded 
in large part hy elevators, now bear away the exports for which 
a swarm of sailing-ships of much lighter draft and average 
freight-room once made long stays at the city's wharves. Pas- 
senger traffic on the rivers has practically vanished, and the 
shrunken fleet of river steamers (only 15 in 1907) are devoted to 
the carrying of slow freights and the towing of barges on the 
rivers and bayous of the lower Mississippi Valley. 2 

The total value of all merchandise exported in the six customs 
years 1902-1993 to 1907- 1 908 averaged $154,757,1 10 yearly, and the 
imports $37,319,254. For the ten years 1890-1899 the correspond- 
ing averages were $95,956,618 and $15,924,594. Bank clearings 
increased in the ten customs years preceding 1906-1907 from 
$447,673,946 to $1,027,^98476 (bank clearings were $956,i54»5<>4 
and $786,067,353 respectively for the calendar years 1907 and 1908). 
There has been an extraordinary increase of exports since 1900, and 
imports from Central America have similarly increased. Cotton 
represents roughly two-thirds of the value of all exports. As a 
cotton port New Orleans in 1908 was second only to Galveston, 
which had only recently surpassed it; and more than half of the raw 
cotton exports of the country passed through these two ports. 
The Board of Trade has maintained a cotton-inspection department 
since 1884, and its statistics are standard on the cotton crop. Cotton 
exports in the four seasons 1903-1904 to 1906-1907 averaged 
1,001,199,468 lb, valued at $104,108,824. Wheat and flour, Indian 
corn, lumber and tobacco are especially noteworthy articles of the 
export, and bananas and coffee of the import, trade. Importations 
of coffee have more than quintupled since 1900; the coffee comes 
for the most part from Brazil and grain wholly from American fields. 
The imports of bananas, for which^ New Orleans is the leading port 
of the country, more than doubled in the same period, and increased 
more than eight-fold^ in the twenty-five years following 1882 
(1,200,000 to 10,200,000 bunches). 

Railway traffic has grown immensely, and port facilities have 
been vastly improved in recent years.- A belt railway owned by the 
city (built 1905-1907) connects all railway terminals, public wharves 
and many manufactories and warehouses. Public ownership pro- 
tects the city's interest in the harbour front, while at the same time 
all railways are equally and cheaply served; and' new railways, 
which could not enter the city or have access to the water front 
because of the impossibility of securing individual trackage, cannow 
enter on the municipal belt. Of privately owned railway terminals 
in 1908 those of the Illinois Central system had nearly 200 m. of 
track; the Stuyvesant Docks of the railway have 15 m ; of track, a 
wharf almost 1 m. long, immense warehouses and grain elevators. 
The New Orleans Terminal Company constructed at Chalmette 

	1 The South-west Pass, originally the usual entrance, could not 
	be entered by vessels drawing more than 16 ft.; the Eads jetties, 
	aided by dredging, provided through the South Pass (500 ft. broad) 
	a channel 180 ft. wide and 25 to 28 ft. deep. South-west Pass has 
	always been the primary outlet of the river, venting half or more 
	of its volume. Active work on its improvement was begun in 1903 
	and practically completed in 1909. Including the jetties, this Pass 
	is nearly 20 m. long and has an average width of about 2150 ft.; 
	the deep channel through it is more than 1000 ft. wide. The jetties, 
	4 m. long on one side and 3 m. on the other, are 6000 ft. apart at 
	their head and 3600 ft. at the sea line. They are built on willow 
	mats (foundation mats 200X150X2 ft.) in wooden frames, sunk 
	with stone and surmounted above the water by a concrete wall. 

	2 The value of the river commerce was about $8,000,000 in 1816 
	and $82,000,000 in 1849. The first steamboat descended the Missis- 
	sippi to New Orleans (from Pittsburg) in 1811, and the first steam- 
	boat trip up the river was made in 181 7. The halcyon period of river 
	steamer traffic was from 1840 to i860. The luxury of the passenger 
	boats then on the Mississippi and the immense volume of the freight- 
	ing traffic are things of the past since the advent of the railway era. 
	The best time ever made (1870) from New Orleans to St Louis 
	(1278 m.) was 3 days, 21 hours and 25 minutes. The races of these 
	river boats were prominent news items in the papers of America 
	and even in those of Europe, and they have been recorded in more 
	than one page of literature. Steam packets replaced sailing vessels 
	in the ocean trade about 1845. 

(1908) splendid terminals, including an immense slip in the river 
(15^0X300 ft., excavated to give 30 ft. of water below zero gauge) 
capable of accommodating nine vessels at dock simultaneously, 
and arranged with remarkable conveniences for the loading of grain. 
Steel-concrete warehouses and elevators surround the slip. The 
greater industrial establishments of the city cluster about the 
terminals. New Orleans is served by eleven railways, including the 
Illinois Central, Southern Pacific, Texas & Pacific and Louisville & 
Nashville systems. The New Orleans & North-eastern crosses Lake 
Pontchartrain over a trestle bridge 7 m. long (originally 25 m. 
before end filling). 

Within the city are two canals, now of little importance, because 
too shallow except for local trade: the Carondelet or Old Basin 
canal, built in 1798, is 2-5 m. long, 55-65 ft- w *de and 7 ft. deep, 
and goes via Bayou St John to Lake Pontchartrain ; and the New 
Basin Canal, built in 1837 by the New Orleans Canal & Banking 
Company, and state property since 1866, is 6'7 m. long, 100 ft. wide 
and 8 ft. deep, and also connects with Lake Pontchartrain. Neither 
of these canals connects with the Mississippi river as do the following 
privately owned canals: the Lake Borgne Canal, from a point 10 m. 
below the city to Lake Borgne, 7 m. long, 80 ft. wide, 7 ft. deep, 
shortening the water distance between Mobile and New Orleans by 
60 m.; and the Barataria & Lafourche Company Canal (7 m. long, 
45 ft. wide and 6 ft. deep) and Harvey's Canal (5-35 m, long, 70 ft. 
wide and 6 ft. deep), both connecting with the Bayou Techc region. 

Manufactures. — Manufacturing has greatly developed since 1890. 
The value of products increased 146-7% from 1880 to 1890, and in 
the following decade the increase of wages paid, cost of materials 
used and value of product were respectively 7-6, 53*3 and 31-5%- 
In 1905 the value of the factory product was $84,604,006,^ 45*4% 
of the value of the total factory product of the state, and an increase 
of 47*3% since 1900; during this same period capital increased 
36-6%, the average number of wage-earners 8-9%, the amount of 
wages 20-5% and the cost of materials used §3-3%. The sugar 
and molasses industry is the most important, with a product value 
of $34,908,614 in 1905; New Orleans ranked second to Philadelphia 
among the cities of the country in the value of this product, that of 
New Orleans being 1 2-6 % of the total value of the country's product. 
At New Orleans is a sugar refinery said to be the largest in the world. 
Of the manufactures from products of the state the most noteworthy 
are rice (value of product cleaned and polished in 1905, $4,881,954), 
bags other than paper (84,076,226), cotton-seed oil and cake 
($3,698,509), malt liquors (82,170,714), tobacco ($1,408,883), lumber 
and timber products ($ 1 ,644,329) and planing mill products 
($i;i05,497) and cotton goods ($1,081,951). Other important 
manufactures are foundry and machine-shop products ($2,085,327), 
men's clothing ($1,979,308), coffee and spice roasted and ground 
($1,638,263) and steam railway cars constructed and repaired 
($1,627,435). New Orleans is the chief centre of the country for the 
manufacture of cotton-seed products and for rice milling. Oyster 
canning is a recent and rapidly growing industry. There are also 
furniture establishments, paper mills and cotton cloth mills. 

Government. — Municipal government is organized under a 
charter framed by the state legislature in 1896, and amended 
by acts of 1898 and 1900. The seven municipal districts corre- 
spond to seven independent faubourgs successively annexed. 
A mayor and various other executive officers and a legislative 
unicameral council are elected for four years. The mayor and 
the heads of departments consult as a " cabinet." Various 
boards — of civil service, public debt, education, health, police, 
fire, drainage, water and sewerage and state commissioners of 
the port — control many of the most important interests of the 
city. The mayor, through his office and his appointive powers, 
exercises great influence in a number of these. In 1896 New 
Orleans followed the example of New York and Chicago in sub- 
jecting its civil service to a competitive merit system and to 
rules of a civil service board. The police board is non-partisan. 
The board of education is composed of seventeen members, each 
elected by one of the seventeen wards of the city. In addition 
to the city board of health, a state board acts with municipal 
authority, and (since April 1907) the United States government 
maintains the maritime quarantine of the Mississippi. The 
commissioners of the port are officials of the state. Owing to 
the complete dominance of the Democratic party, all reform 
movements in politics must come from within that organization. 
Reform organizations have been intermittently powerful since 
1888, and among their achievements for good were the beginning 
of the great drainage and sewerage improvements and the 
adoption of the charter of 1896. The present government of 
the city compares very favourably with systems tried in the past. 1 

	1 The charter of 1805 organized the old citS (the Vieux CarrS) 
	and the faubourgs as distinct municipalities with almost wholly 

In 1909 the total assessed valuation of property was $221,373,362, 
of which $154,604,325 was realty and the remainder personalty. 
The bonded debt on the 30th of June 1909 was $32,521^40 and 
the floating debt at the end 0^1908 was $1,264,030. 

From 1890 to 1900 the expenditures for permanent works (includ- 
ing sewerage, lighting, paving, levees, improvements in connexion 
with street and steam railways, docks, &c.) aggregated $30,000,000. 
Almost all the public services, nevertheless, were in 1909 in private 
hands. Electric traction was introduced in 1891-1895, and the 
street railways were consolidated in 1902 under one management. 
In 1869 the city bought, and nine years later sold again, the water- 
works; municipal ownership and control, under a sewerage and 
water board, was again undertaken in 1900. In 1900 arrangements 
were made to transfer the extensive markets from private lessees to 
direct municipal^ control, and in May 1901 the wharves of the city 
passed from private to municipal control. 2 The municipal belt 
railway was constructed in 1 905-1 907. 

Until 1900 there were no sewers, open gutters serving their purpose. 
It is remarkable that the city twjee granted franchises to private 
parties for the construction of a sewerage system, but without 
result. The low and extremely level character of the city site, of 
which nearly one-third is at or below the level of the Gulf, the re- 
currence of back-water floods from Lake Pontchartrain and the 
tremendous rains of the region have made the engineering problems 
involvedct'VSJ difficult. In 1896 a Drainage Commission (merged in 
1900 in a Sewerage and Water Board) devised a plan involving the 
sale of street railway franchises to pay for the installation of drainage 
canals and pumps, and ^1899 the people voted a 2-mill tax over 
42 years assuring a bond issue of $12,000,000 to pay for sewerage, 
drainage and water works to be owned by the municipality and to be 
controlled by a Sewerage and Water Board. Work was begun on 
the sewerage system in 1905 and on the water works in 1905. In 
1906 the legislature authorized the issue of municipal bonds for 
$8,000,000 to be expended on this work. Up to 1909 the drainage 
system had cost about $6,000,000 and the sewerage system about 
$5,000,000; and 310 m. of sewers and nine sewerage pumping 
stations discharged sewage into the Mississippi below the centre of 
the city. Garbage is used to fill in swamps and abandoned canals. 
The new water-supply is secured from the river and is filtered by 
mechanical precipitation and other means. By 1909 about 500 m. 
of water-mains had been laid, $7,000,000 had been expended for the 
water-system, and filtering plants had been established with a 
capacity of 50,000,000 gallons a day. ^ In August 1905 a city ordin- 
ance required the screening of aerial cisterns, formerly characteristic 
of the city, which were breeding-places of the yellow fever Stegomyia, 
and soon afterwards the state legislature authorized the Sewerage 
and Water Board to require the removal of all such cisterns. About 
two-thirds of the street surfacein 1899 was still unpaved; the first 
improvements in paving began in 1890. 

As regards hygienic conditions much too has been done in recent 
years. New Orleans was long notorious for unhcalthiness. Yellow 
fever first appeared in 1769, and there were about thirty epidemics 
from 1769 to 1878. Though the first board of health and first 
quarantine system date back to 182 1, frorn 1787 to 1853 the average 
death-rate was 59*63 per 1000; never did it fall below 25*00, which 
was the rate in 1827. In 1832, a cholera year, it rose to 148; in 
i853-i854-i855,the great yellow-fever years, complicated in 1854- 
1855 by cholera, it was 102, 72 and 73. During these three years 
there were more than 25,000 deaths. The millesimal mortality in 
1851-1855 and succeeding quinquennial periods to 1880 was as 
follows: 70, 45, 40, 39, 34-5 and 33-5. The rate reported by the 
national census of 1900 was 28-9, the highest of any of the large 
separate governments: they issued paper money independently, for 
example. The charter of 1836 was also an extreme statement of 
local self-government; the municipalities were practically inde- 
pendent, although there was a common mayor and a general council 
of the entire city meetingoncc annually. This organization was in 
large part due to the hostility of the Creoles to the Americans. The 
charter of 1852 formed a consolidated city. That of 1856 added to 
and amended its predecessor. That of 1870 was very notable as 
an attempt to secure a business-like and simplified administration. 
A mayor and seven " administrators," elected on a general ticket 
and constituting individually the different administrative depart- 
ments, formed collectively a council with legislative powers. All 
sessions of the council were public, and liberties of suggestion were 
freely accorded to the citizens. Tried in better times, and as a move- 
ment for reform sprung from the people and not due primarily to an 
external impulse, this system might have been permanent and might 
have exercised great influence on other cities. The early 'seventies 
were marked by a great widening of the city's corporate limits. 
In 1882 another charter went back to the ordinary^ American plan 
of elective district councillors chosen for the legislative branch, 
and executive officers chosen on a general ticket. The latter held 
seats in the council and could debate but not vote. This is me 
present system. 

* They were leased to a private company in 1891-1901, but the 
lease was unprofitable and was disadvantageous to trade. From 
1901 to 1908 wharfage and harbour dues were reduced 25 to 85 %. 
cities of the United States. 1 This high death-rate is often attri- 
buted in great part to the large negro population, among whom the 
mortality in 1900 was 42-1 per 1000; but the negro population 
largely comprises that labouring element whose faulty provision for 
health and sickness in every large city swells the death-rate. A 
light yellow-fever epidemic occurred in 1897-1898-1899, after nine- 
teen years of immunity, and a more serious one in 1905, when the 
United States Marine Hospital Service for a time took control of 
the city's sanitation and attempted to exterminate the SUgomyia 
mosquito. The city Board of Health has done much to secure pure 
food for the people, and has exercised efficient oversight of com- 
municable diseases, including yellow fever. In movements for the 
betterment of the city — in commerce, sanitation, public works and 
general enterprise — a leading part has been taken by an organization 
of citizens known as the New Orleans Progressive Union, whose 
charter and by-laws prohibit its participation in political and religious 
issues. 

History. — New Orleans was founded in 1718 by Jean Baptiste 
Lemoyne, Sieur de Bienville, and was named in honour of 
the then Regent of France. 2 The priest-chronicler Charlevoix 
described it in 172 1 as a place of a hundred wretched hovels in 
a malarious wet thicket of willows and dwarf palmettos, infested 
by serpents and alligators; he seems to have -been the first, 
however, to predict for it an imperial future. In 1722 New 
Orleans was made the capital of the vast province of Louisiana 
(q.v.). Much of the population in early days was of the wildest 
and, in part, of the most undesirable character — deported 
galley-slaves, trappers, gold-hunters and city scourings; and 
the governors' letters are full of complaints regarding the riff- 
raff sent as soldiers as late as Kerlerec's administration (1753- 
1763). In 17S8 a fire destroyed a large part of the city. In 
1 795-1 796 the sugar industry was first put upon a firm basis. 
The last twenty years of the 18th century were especially char- 
acterized by the growth of commerce on the Mississippi, and the 
development of those international interests, commercial and 
political, of which New Orleans was the centre. The year 1803 
is memorable for the actual transfer (at New Orleans) of Louis- 
iana to France, and the establishment of American dominion. 
At this time the city had about 10,000 inhabitants, mostly French 
Creoles and their slaves. The next dozen years were marked by 
the beginnings of self-government in city and state; by the 
excitement attending the Aaron Burr conspiracy (in the course 
of which, in 1806-1807, General James Wilkinson practically 
put New Orleans under martial Jaw); by the immigration from 
Cuba of French planters; and by the American War of 181 2. 

In 1815 New Orleans was attacked by a conjunct expedition 
of British naval and military forces from Halifax, N.S., and other 
points. The American government managed to obtain early 
information of the enterprise and prepared to meet it with forces 
(regular and militia) under Ma j.- Gen. Andrew Jackson. The 
British advance was made by way of Lake Borgne, and the 
troops landed at a fisherman's village on the 23rd of December 
1814, Major-General Sir E. Pakenham taking command there 
on the 25th. An immediate advance on the still insufficiently 
prepared defences of the Americans might have led to the 
capture of the city, but this was not attempted, and both sides 
remained inactive for some time awaiting reinforcements. At 
last in the early morning of the 8th of January 1815 (after the 
Treaty of Ghent had been signed) a direct attack was made on 
the now strongly entrenched line of the defenders at Chalmette, 
near the Mississippi river. It failed disastrously with a loss of 
2000 out of 9000 British troops engaged, among the dead being 
Pakenham and Major-General Gibbs. The expedition was soon 
afterwards abandoned and the troops embarked for England. 

From this time to the outbreak of the American Civil War the 
city annals are almost wholly commercial. Hopeful activity 

	1 But the death-rate of New Orleans was not so high as that of 
	some smaller Southern cities, Richmond (29-7), Savannah (34*3) or 
	Charleston (37-5), for example. According to Mortality Statistics, 
	1905 (Washington, 1907), the death-rate in New Orleans in 1905 was 
	23-7, and the annual average between 1900 and 1904 was 23-1. 

	2 Two of the lakes in the vicinity commemorate respectively Louis 
	Phelypeaux, Count Pontchartrain, minister and chancellor of 
	France, and Jean Frederic Phelypeaux, Count Maurepas, minister 
	and secretary of state; a third is really a landlocked inlet of tlje sea, 
	and its name (Lake Borgne) has reference to its " incomplete " or 
	44 defective " character. 

and great * development characterized especially the decade 
1830-1840. The introduction of gas (about 1830); the building 
of the New Orleans and Pontchartrain railway (1820-1830), one 
of the eariiest in the United States; the introduction of the first 
steam cotton press (1832), and the beginning of the public school 
system (1840) marked these years; foreign exports more than 
doubled in the period 1831-1833. Travellers in this decade have 
left pictures of the animation of the river trade — more congested 
in those days of river boats and steamers and ocean-sailing craft 
than to-day; of the institution of slavery, the quadroon balls, 
the medley of Latin tongues, the disorder and carousals of the 
river-men and adventurers that filled the city. Altogether there 
was much of the wildness of a frontier town, and a seemingly 
boundless promise of prosperity. The crisis of 1837, indeed, was 
severely felt, but did not greatly retard the city's advancement, 
which continued unchecked until the Civil War. In 1849 
Baton Rouge replaced New Orleans as the capital of the state. 
In 1850 telegraphic communication was established with St 
Louis and New York; in 1851 the New Orleans & Jackson 
railway, the first railway outlet northward, now part of the 
Illinois Central, and in 1854 the western outlet, now the Southern 
Pacific, were begun. 

The political and commercial importance of New Orleans, 
as well as its strategic position, marked it out as the objective 
of a Union expedition soon after the opening of the Civil War. 
Captain D. G. Farragut (q.v.) was selected by the Union govern- 
ment for the command of the Western Gulf squadron in January 
1862. The four heavy ships of the squadron (none of them 
armoured) were with many difficulties brought up to the head of 
the passes, and around them assembled nineteen smaller vessels 
(mostly gunboats) and a flotilla of twenty mortar-boats under 
Commander D. D. Porter (q.v.). The main defences of the 
Mississippi consisted of the two permanent forts Jackson and St 
Philip. These were of masonry and brick construction, armed 
with heavy rifled guns as well as smooth-bores, and placed on 
either bank so as to command long reaches of the river and the 
surrounding flats. In addition, the Confederates had some im- 
provised ironclads and gunboats, large and small. On the 16th 
of April, after elaborate reconnaissances, the Union fleet steamed 
up into position below the forts, and on the 18th the mortar-boats 
opened fire. Their shells fell with great accuracy, and although 
one of the boats was sunk and two disabled, fort Jackson was 
seriously damaged. But the defences were by no means crippled 
even after a second bombardment on the 19th, and a formidable 
obstacle to the advance of the Union main fleet was a boom 
between the forts designed to detain the ships under close fire 
should they attempt to run past. At that time the eternal duel 
of ship versus fort seemed to have been settled in favour of the 
latter, and it was well for the Union government that it. had 
placed its ablest and most resolute officer at the head of the 
squadron. Gunboats were repeatedly sent up at night to 
endeavour to destroy the boom, and the bombardment went on, 
disabling only a few guns but keeping the gunners of fort Jackson 
under cover. At last the gunboats " Pinola " and " Itasca " ran 
in and broke a gap in the boom, and at 2 a.m. on the 24th the 
fleet weighed, Farragut in the corvette " Hartford " leading. 
After a severe conflict at close quarters, with the forts and with 
the ironclads and fire rafts of the defence, almost all the Union fleet 
(except the mortar-boats) forced its w T ay past. At noon on the 
25th Farragut anchored in front of New Orleans; forts Jackson and 
St Philip, isolated and continuously bombarded by the mortar- 
boats, surrendered on the 28th; and soon afterwards the military 
portion of the expedition occupied the city. The commander, 
General B. F. Butler, subjected New Orleans to a rigorous 
martial law so tactlessly administered as greatly to intensify the 
hostility of South and North, but his administration was in many 
respects beneficial to the city, which was kept both orderly 
and healthy. Towards the end of the war General N.P. Banks 
held the command at New Orleans. 

Throughout the years of the Civil War and the Reconstruction 
period the history of the city is inseparable from that of the state. 
All the constitutional conventions were held here, the seat of 
government again was here (in 1864-1882) and New Orleans 
was the centre of dispute and organization in the struggle 
between the races for the control of government. Notable events 
of that struggle in city history were : the street riot of the 30th of 
July 1 866, at the time of the meeting of the radical constitutional 
convention; and the " revolution " of the 14th of September 
1874, when the White League worsted the Republican metro- 
politan police in pitched battle and forced the temporary flight 
of the Kellogg government. The latter was reinstated in power 
by the United States troops, and by the same power the Democrats 
were frustrated in January 1875, after they had wrested from 
the RepubHcans the organization of the state legislature. Never- 
theless, the " revolution " of 1874 is generally regarded as the 
independence day of Reconstruction, although not until President 
Hayes withdrew the troops in 1877 and the Packard government 
fell did the Democrats actually hold control of the state and city. 
The financial condition of the city when the whites gained control 
was very bad. The tax-rate had risen in 1873 to 3%. The city 
defaulted in 1874 on the interest of its bonded debt, later re- 
funding this ($22,000,000 in 1875) at a lower rate, so as to decrease 
the annual charge from $1,416,000 to $307,500. Among events 
in the decade 1880-1890 were the World's Industrial and Cotton 
Centennial Exposition of 1884-1885 (celebrating the centennial 
of the cotton industry of the country), and the introduction of 
electric lighting (1886); in the decade 1890-1900 the intro- 
duction of electric transit, the latest charter and the improve- 
ments in public works already detailed. The lynching of Italian 
subjects by a mob in 1891 1 caused serious international com- 
plications. 

Among the many floods from which the city has suffered those 
of 1849 and 1882 were the most destructive.

NEW PHILADELPHIA, a city and the county-seat of Tuscar- 
awas county, Ohio, U.S.A., on the Tuscarawas River and near the 
Ohio canal, about 75 m. S. by E. of Cleveland. Pop. (1890) 4456; 
(1900) 6213 (554 foreign-born); (1910) 8542. It is served by the 
Baltimore & Ohio (the Cleveland, Lorain & Wheeling Division), 
and the Pennsylvania (Cleveland & Pittsburgh Division) railways, 
and by an inter-urban electric system. The city has a level site 
in the midst of a good agricultural country, which abounds in 
coal and fire-clay. In the public square is a soldiers* monument, 
and the city has a public library and a park. Its principal 
manufactures are steel, enamelled ware, clay goods, brooms, 
flour and carriages. The first settlement in the vicinity was made 
in May 1772, when Moravian Indian converts migrated from 
Pennsylvania (Friedenshutten, Bradford county, and Frieden- 
stadt, Lawrence county) to Schoenbrunn, called by the Indians 
Welhik-Tuppeek, a spring (now dry) a little south of the present 
New Philadelphia. Under David Zeisbergcr (1721-1808) and 

1 In October 1890 the chief of police was assassinated, and before 
he died charged the crime" to Italians. He had been active in pro- 
ceedings against certain Italians accused of crime, and his death was 
popularly attributed to the Mafia. Nineteen Sicilians were indicted, 
and of nine put on trial six were acquitted and three escaped convic- 
tion on the ground of a mis-trial. On the 14th of March 1891 a mob 
broke into the jail and lynched eleven of the accused. The Italian 
government demanded that the lynchers should be punished, entered 
claims for indemnity in the case of the three Sicilians who had been 
Italian subjects, and, failing to secure as prompt an answer as it 
desired, withdrew its ambassador from Washington. In 1892 the 
United States paid an indemnity of $25,000 to Italy. 

Johann Gottlieb Ernestus Heckewelder (1743-1823) other 
missionary villages were planted at Gnadenhutten (October 1772)* 
Lichtenau (1776) and Salem (1780), all in the present county 
of Tuscarawas. After the massacre of Christian Indians at 
Gnadenhutten in 1782 the Indians removed to Michigan and 
in 1 791 to Fairfield, Ontario; in 1798 some of them returned to 
Tuscarawas county and settled Goshen, where Zelsberger is 
buried. New Philadelphia was laid out in 1804 and was named 
by its founder, John Knisely, after Philadelphia in Pennsylvania; 
it was incorporated as a village in 1815, and was first chartered 
as a city in 1896.

NEW PLYMOUTH, a municipality and seaport on the west coast 
of North Island, New Zealand, capital of the provincial district 
of Taranaki, 258 m. N.N.W. of Wellington by rail. Pop. (1906) 
5141. The town slopes to the ocean, with a background of forest 
surmounted by the snow-clad volcanic cone of Mount Egmont 
(8270 ft.). The district is not unjustly termed " the garden of 
New Zealand. 1 ' It is highly fertile, cereals and fruit's growing 
well; and dairy products are extensively exported. In the town 
are leather-works, timber-works and flour-mills, with freezing- 
works for export dairy produce. The settlement was founded in 
1841 by the Plymouth Company under the auspices of the 
New Zealand Company, and chiefly consisted of emigrants from 
Devonshire and Cornwall. On the seashore in the neighbourhood 
are extensive deposits of ironsand. 


NEW POMERANIA (Ger. Neu-Pommern, formerly New 
Britain^ native Birara), an island of the Bismarck Archipelago, 
N.E. of New Guinea in the Pacific Ocean, about 6° S., 150 E., 
in the administration of German New Guinea. It is crescent- 
shaped, about 330 m. long, and, except where the Willaumez 
Peninsula projects northward, nowhere more than 60 m. wide. 
The north-eastern extremity consists of the broad, irregular 
Gazelle Peninsula, joined to the main mass hy a narrow neck. 
The total area is about 9500 sq. m. The island is in great part 
unexplored. The coasts are in some parts precipitous; in 
others the mountains recede inland, and the coast is flat and 
bordered by coral reefs. The formation appears otherwise to be . 
volcanic, and there are some active craters. The greatest 
elevation occurs towards the west — about 6500 ft. There is a 
rich tropical vegetation, and a number of considerable streams 
water the island. The chief centre is Herbertshohe at the north 
of the Gazelle Peninsula; it is the seat of the governor of German 
New Guinea (see New Guinea). 

The natives are Melanesians, resembling their Papuan kinsmen of 
eastern New Guinea, and are a powerful well-formed race. Their 
villages are clean and well kept. Unlike their Papuan relatives, the 
islanders are unskilled in carving and pottery, but are clever farmers 
and fishermen, constructing ingenious fishing weirs. They have a 
fixed monetary system consisting of strings of cowries. They per- 
form complicated surgical operations with an obsidian knife or a 
shark's tooth. The common dead are buried or exposed to sharks 
on the reefs; bodies of chiefs are exposed in the fork of a tree. 
Justice^ is executed, and taboos, feasts, taxes, &c, arranged^ by a 
mysterious disguised figure, the duk-duk. The population is divided 
into two exogamous classes. The children belong to the class of the 
mother, and when the father dies go to her village for support, the 
land and fruit trees in each district being divided between the two 
classes. There are several dialects, the construction resembling 
Fijian, as in the pronominal suffixes in singular, triad and plural; 
the numerals, however, are Polynesian in character. 


NEWPORT, a market town and municipal borough, the 
chief town of the Isle of Wight, England. Pop. (1901) 10,911. 
It is situated near the centre of the island, at the head of the 
navigation of the Medina River, 5 m. S. from its mouth at Cowes. 
It is the chief centre of the railway system of the island. The 
church of St Thomas of Canterbury, rebuilt in 1854 in the 
Decorated style, contains many interesting old monuments; 
and one by Marochetti to the princess Elizabeth, daughter of 
Charles L, erected by Queen Victoria. The guildhall, erected in 
1816 from the designs of Nash, includes the town-hall in the 
upper story with the market-place below. There are a corn 
exchange and museum. The grammar school (the scene of 
negotiations between Charles I. and the parliament) was founded 
in 1612, and there, is a blue-coat school for girls founded in 
1 761. The Albany barracks and Parkhurst prison lie north of 
the town. A considerable trade is carried on in timber, malt, 
wheat and flour. The town is governed by a mayor, 6 aldermen 
and 18 councillors. Area 504 acres. 

It is supposed that Newport (Neuport) was a Roman settle- 
ment, then known as Medina. There are no traces of Saxon 
occupation, and no evidence that Newport became a borough 
before the reign of Henry II., though it was probably used 
• before that time as a port of entrance for the ancient capital of 
Carisbrooke. The first charter was granted by Richard de 
Redvers between 1177 and 1184, freeing the burgesses from 
tolls throughout the island, from hundred suits, and from being 
impleaded without the walls, and giving them permission to 
choose their own reeve — privileges for which they paid 18 marks 
yearly. These grants, repeated and extended by the countess 
Isabel de Fortibus, were confirmed in 1349 by Edward III. and 
afterwards by successive kings, Henry VII. in 1489 granting 
in addition the petty customs within all ports and creeks of the 
island. The borough was incorporated by James I. in 1607, 
and a second charter of incorporation granted by Charles I. 
in 1637 is that by which Newport was governed until 1835. It 
was represented in parliament in 1295, but no return was made 
from that time until 1584, from which date it regularly sent two 
members. In 1867 the number was reduced to one, and in 1885 
its representation was merged in that of the island. A fair was 
formerly held on Whit-Monday and the two following days, and 
on the three Saturdays nearest Whitsuntide, known as " Bargain 
Saturdays," there was a hiring fair for servants. There is now 
no fair. The Saturday market dates from 1184, and there is a 
Wednesday cattle market. Owing to its facilities for trade, 
Newport early superseded Carisbrooke as the capital of the 
island. Its prosperity in medieval times depended upon its 
harbour dues and its oyster beds in the river Medina. 


NEWPORT, a municipal and county borough, contributory 
parliamentary borough, seaport and market town in the Mon- 
mouth parliamentary division of boroughs, Monmouthshire, 
England, on the Usk, 5 m. from its confluence with the Severn, 
and 1 33 J m. W. of London by the Great Western railway. 
Pop. (1891) 54,707; (1901) 67,270. It lies chiefly on the right 
(west) bank of the river, and on the E., N. and W. it is sheltered 
by a line of lofty hills. The old parish church of St Woollos 
stands finely on Stow Hill. Originally it consisted only of the 
present nave, a fine specimen of grand though unadorned 
Norman architecture; but a massive square tower (of the time 
of Henry III.) and a chancel were subsequently added; a large 
western Early English lady-chapel is interposed between the 
nave and the tower. The old castle, built about 1 130 by Robert, 
earl of Gloucester, was greatly altered in the late Perpendicular 
period. The remains include two towers and the river frontage. 
The old Dominican monastery is entirely rebuilt and occupied as 
a private residence; but there are a few fragments of a house of 
White Friars. The principal public buildings are the spacious 
Victoria Hall, the Albert Hall, the town-hall, county council 
offices, market-house, custom-house, and museum and art 
gallery. Newport owes a rapid increase in importance to its 
situation on a deep and spacious tidal river, which renders it a 
convenient outlet for the trade of a rich mineral district. It 
has extensive docks and wharves, to which large steamers have 
access at all tides. Three docks, the Alexandra, South and Old 
Docks, had together a water area of about 60 acres, besides 
the Alexandra graving dock and dry docks. But additional 
accommodation was found necessary. In 1905 the Alexandra 
Docks and Railway company let the contract for the extension 
of the docks by 50 acres of water area, and the scheme was 
enlarged later so as to afford an additional area of 86 acres in all. 
The new works, added to the old Alexandra Dock, give a total 
deep-water area of over 130 acres. The first part to be 
completed (48 acres) was filled in the autumn of 1907. The 
river is crossed by a transporter bridge, opened in 1906, and 
having a span of 645 ft. and a clear headway from high water 
of 177 ft., with a travelling truck worked by electricity. Iron 
ore, pig iron, timber and grain are among the chief imports, 
while coal and iron goods are exported. Besides the Great 
Western railway, Newport is served by the London and North- 
western, the Rhymney, and the Brecon & Merthyr systems. 
The town possesses large iron foundries and engineering works, 
and among other industries are the manufacture of wagons and 
wheels, nails, bolts and wire, shipbuilding and the making of 
railway plant, chemical manures and agricultural implements. 
There are also large breweries, glass and pottery works, and an 
extensive cattle market. Newport gives name to a Roman 
Catholic bishopric, but the cathedral church is at Belmont near 
Hereford. With Monmouth and Usk, Newport returns one 
member to parliament. In 1889 Maindee, a populous suburb 
on the left bank of the Usk, was incorporated with Newport, 
and constitutes one of its five wards. The town is governed by 
a mayor, 10 aldermen and 30 councillors. Area 4431 acres. 

Newport, an ancient mesne borough and castle, occupied an 
important position on the Welsh marches. The town, which is 
not mentioned in Domesday, grew up round the castle built 
early in the 12th century. Giraldus Cambrensis, writing in 1187, 
calls it Novus Burgus, probably to distinguish it from Caerleon, 
whose prosperity declined as that of Newport increased. The 
first lord was Robert Fitz Hamon, who died in 1107, and from 
him the lordship passed to the earls of Gloucester and Stafford 
and the dukes of Buckingham. Hugh le Despenser, who held 
the lordship for a short time, obtained in 1323 a charter of 
liberties for the burgesses, granting them freedom from toll 
throughout England, Ireland and Aquitaine. The earl of 
Stafford granted a further charter in 1385, confirmed by his 
grandson in 1427, which gave the burgesses the right of self- 
government and of a merchant gild. On the attainder of the 
duke of Buckingham in 1483 the lordship lapsed to the crown, 
of whom it was held in the 16th and 17th centuries by the 
Pembrokes, and in the 19th by the Beauforts. The town was 
incorporated by charter of James I. in 1624 under the title of 
" Mayor and Bailiffs." This charter was confirmed by Charles II. 
in 1685 and holds force at the present day. By the act of 
J 53S~ 1 S3^ Newport is entitled as an ancient borough to take 
part in the election of a member for Monmouth town. The 
commercial importance of the town dates only from the second 
half of the 19th century, the Old Dock being partially formed in 
1842, while the Alexandra was opened in 1875. In 1801 the 
population of the town was only 1135. In 1385 the borough 
obtained a market lasting fifteen days from the vigil of St 
Lawrence (August 10). The charter of 1624 granted two fairs, 
one on the feast of the Ascension, and a second (still held) on 
St Leonard's day (November 6). Newport was the scene of a 
serious Chartist riot in 1839. 


NEWPORT, a market town in the Newport parliamentary 
division of Shropshire, England, 145 m. N.W. from London 
on the Stafford-Shrewsbury joint line of the London & North- 
western and Great Western railways, and on the Shrewsbury 
canal. Pop. of urban district (1901) 3241. The church of St 
Nicholas is Early English and Perpendicular. There is an 
ancient market cross, greatly decayed. Newport possesses a 
literary institute, and a free grammar school founded in 1665. 
Four miles S. are the beautiful ruins of Lilleshall abbey, including 
a fine Norman west door and part of the front, considerable 
remains of the church besides, and traces of domestic buildings. 
The abbey was founded in 1145, under charter from King 
Stephen, by Richard de Baumes or Belmeis, dean of St Alkmund, 
Shrewsbury, for Augustinian canons, who were brought from 
Dorchester Abbey, Oxfordshire. Ironstone, coal and limestone 
are worked in the parish. 

Newport is not mentioned in the Domesday Survey, but 
at the time of the Conquest formed part of the manor of Edg- 
mond, which William I. gave with the rest of the county of 
Shropshire to Roger, earl of Shrewsbury. Henry I. is supposed 
to have founded the borough, at first called New .Borough, after 
the manor had come into his hands through the forfeiture of 
Robert de Belesme. The site was probably chosen partly on 
account of the fisheries, which are mentioned in the Domesday 
Survey, one of the chief services of the burgesses being that of 
taking fish to the king's court wherever it might be. This 
custom was continued after Henry III. had granted the borough 
with the manor of Edgmond, to Henry de Audley, but in the 
middle of the 13th century James, son of Henry de Audley, 
granted that the burgesses need not take the fish anywhere 
except within the county of Shropshire. The burgesses must 
have received certain privileges from Henry I., since Henry II. 
in an undated charter granted them all the liberties, rights and 
customs which they had in the time of Henry I. This probably 
included a gild merchant which is mentioned in the Quo Warranto 
Rolls as one of the privileges claimed by the burgesses. Con- 
firmation charters were granted by Edward I. in 1287 and 
Edward II. in 13 11, while the town was incorporated in 1551 
by Edward VI. whose charter was confirmed by James I. in 
1604. The governing body consisted of a high steward, deputy 
steward, two water-bailiffs and 28 burgesses, but the corporation 
was abolished by the Municipal Corporation Act of 1883, and a 
Local Board was formed, which, under the Local Government 
Act, gave place in 1894 to an urban district council.

NEWPORT, a city of Campbell county, Kentucky, U.S.A., 
on the Ohio River opposite Cincinnati, Ohio, and at the mouth 
of the Licking River opposite Covington, Ky. Pop. (1900) 
28,301, of whom 4081 were foreign-born and 424 were negroes; 
(1910 census) 30,309. It is served by the Louisville & Nash- 
ville, and the Chesapeake & Ohio railways, and by electric lines 
to Covington, Cincinnati, Bellevue, Fort Thomas and Dayton. 
With Cincinnati and Covington it is connected by bridges. In 
the highlands, about 3 m. back of the city, is Fort Thomas, a 
United States military post, established in 1888 to supersede 
Newport Barracks (1804), in the city, which were abandoned 
in 1894. Newport is essentially a residential suburb of Cin- 
cinnati, but it is also industrially important. In 1905 the value 
of the factory product was $5,231,084, Newport ranking third 
among the manufacturing centres of the state. Newport was 
settled late in the 18th century, was laid out in 1791, was incor- 
porated as a town in 1795, and was chartered as a city in 1834. 


NEWPORT, a city, a port of entry and the county-seat of 
Newport county, Rhode Island, U.S.A., occupying the southern 
portion of the island of Rhode Island at the entrance to Narra- 
gansett Bay, about 30 m. S. by E. of Providence, about 71m. 
S. by W. of Boston and about 165 m. E.N.E. of New York. 
Pop. (1905 state census) 25,039, of whom 611 1 were foreign- 
born, 2590 being born in Ireland; (1910 U.S. census) 27,149. 
It is served by the Newport & Wickford Railroad and Steam- 
boat Line, which connects with the New York, New Haven & 
Hartford railway at Wickford Junction; by ferry to Bristol, 
and by steamboats to Providence, Fall River and New York. 

The broken water-front of the island, about 17 m. long, is 
partly rocky and partly made up of sandy beaches. From 
the harbour on the south-west the land rises to a gently rolling 
plateau with maximum elevations of about 250 ft. The climate 
is notably mild and equable throughout the greater part of the 
year. In the newer parts of the city there are many magnificent 
estates of summer residents; and in the " Old Town," the 
greater part of which is close to the harbour, and extending up 
the hillside, are many 18th-century houses and Thames Street, 
its principal business thoroughfare, only 20 ft. wide. Near 
the northern end of Thames Street, Washington Square or the 
Parade, connects with Broadway, which extends northward 
and is the principal thoroughfare through a large residential 
district of the permanent inhabitants. From the Parade, also, 
Touro Street extends eastward to the upper end of Bellevue 
Avenue, the principal street, which extends southward to the 
ocean. There Bellevue Avenue connects with the southern 
end of the Cliff Walk, which for about 3 m. winds along the 
cliffs on the eastern coast of the island. North of the walk is 
the smooth, hard Easton's Beach, frequented for sea-bathing. 

South of the Cliff Walk is Bailey's Beach, a private bathing- 
beach; at its western end is the Spouting Rock, through an 
opening in which the water, during violent south-east gales, has 
been thrown to a height of about 50 ft. Ocean Drive, about 
9 m. long, encircles the south-western peninsula. Beyond 
Easton's Beach, in the town of Middletown, is Sachuest, or 
Second, Beach, with a heavier surf, and here is a fissure in the 
rocks, 150 ft. long and 50 ft. deep, and 8-14 ft. wide, known as 
Purgatory. North of Sachuest Beach are the picturesque 
Paradise Rocks and the Hanging Rocks. 

At the head of the Parade stands the old State House (used 
when Newport was one of the capitals of Rhode Island); it 
was completed about 1743, was used as a hospital during the 
War of Independence, and is now the seat of the county court. 
In the vicinity are the City Hall and a monument to Oliver 
Hazard Perry. Fronting on Touro Street is a synagogue, erected 
in 1 762-1 763, and said to be the oldest in the United States;, 
one of the early rabbis was Isaac Touro, a Jew of Dutch birth, 
whose name is borne by a street and a park in Newport. Near 
the corner of Touro Street and Bellevue Avenue is the Hebrew 
cemetery. Of chief historic interest along Bellevue Avenue 
are Touro Park and Redwood Library. In the park is the 
historic old Stone Mill or " Round Tower," which Longfellow, 
in accordance with the contention of certain members of the 
Society of Danish Antiquarians, ascribes, in his Skeleton in 
Armour , to the Norsemen, but which Benedict Arnold (16 15- 
1678), governor of Rhode Island, repeatedly mentions in his 
will as " my Stone-built Wind-Mill." Opposite the park stands 
the William Ellery Channing Memorial Church ; and in the park 
are monuments to Channing and to Matthew Calbraith Perry. 
The Channing House on Mary Street, built in i75i,is now used 
for a Children's Home. The Redwood Library grew out of the 
Philosophical Society, established in 1730, which Bishop (then 
Dean) Berkeley possibly helped to found during his residence 
here in 1729-1731; the Library was incorporated in 1747, 
being named in honour of Abraham Redwood (c. 1700-1788), 
a wealthy Friend who early contributed £500 toward supplying 
it with books; the building was completed in 1750. In Berkeley 
Avenue, north of Paradise Road, is Whitehall, which Berkeley 
built for his home in 1729 and which was restored in 1900. The 
first newspaper of Newport was published in 1732 by James 
Franklin, a brother of Benjamin Franklin, and in 1758 James 
Franklin's son, also named James, founded the present Newport 
Mercury. 

Newport is best known as a fashionable resort during the 
summer and autumn; there are annual horse and dog shows, 
and fox-hunting is one of the amusements. The harbour is a 
rendezvous for racing- and pleasure-yachts. On Bellevue Avenue 
is the country club, the Casino. Among the great estates with 
magnificent " cottages " here are those of Mrs Cornelius Vander- 
bilt, Wm. B. Leeds, Mrs O. H. P. Belmont (the "Marble Palace," 
built for W. K. Vanderbilt), Mrs Ogden Goelet, Mrs Robert 
Goelet, Perry Belmont, and J. J. Astor — all on the Cliff Walk. 

Newport has an inner and an outer harbour; the inner is 
landlocked, 1 m. long and ^ m. wide, but is not deep enough 
to admit vessels drawing more than 15 ft. of water; the outer 
admits the largest vessels and is a refuge for foreign and coastwise 
commerce. The whole harbour is protected at its entrance 
by Fort Adams, at the mouth of the inner harbour, Fort Wetherill 
on Conanicut Island, and Fort Greble on Dutch Island. The 
Lime Rock Lighthouse was for many years in charge of Mrs Ida 
Lewis Wilson (b. 1841), famous for the many lives she saved. 
On Goat Island, which partly encloses the inner harbour, is 
Fort Walcott, with a United States torpedo station and torpedo 
factory, and on Coasters Harbor Island, farther north, are a 
United States Naval Training Station and a War College. Along 
the western border of the outer harbour is Conanicut Island, on 
which is the town of Jamestown (pop. in 1905, 1337), with the 
Conanicut Yacht Club and other attractions for summer visitors. 
Newport has little foreign trade. There is, however, considerable 
coastwise trade in fish, coal and general merchandise, and in 
1905 the total tonnage of the port amounted to 1,770,816 tons. 
Fishing is an industry of some importance. The value of the city's 
factory products decreased from $1,575, 192 in l 9°° to $1,347,104 
in 1905. 

Newport is governed under a charter of 1906, which is unique 
as an instrument for the government of a city, and aims to restore 
in a measure the salient features of township government. Most 
of the powers usually vested in a town meeting are here vested 
in a representative council of 195 members — 39 from each of 5 
wards. A candidate for councilman must secure the signature of 
at least 30 electors in his ward before his name can be placed on 
the ballot. A mayor, one alderman from each ward, and a school 
committee are elected in much the same manner: a candidate 
for mayor must have his election paper signed by at least 250 
qualified electors, and an alderman or member of the school 
committee by at least 100. All other important officers are 
appointed by the council. The mayor and aldermen are for the 
most part executive officials corresponding to the selectmen of 
a town. 

Newport was founded by Nicholas Easton ( 1 593-1 67 5) , 
William Coddington (1601-1678), John Coggeshall, John Clarke 
(1600-1676), William Brenton (d. 1674), William Dyer, Thomas 
Hazard, Henry Bull (1 609-1693) and Jeremy Clerke (d. 1652), 
who, as Antinomians, were driven from Massachusetts Bay, 
and in 1638 settled at Pocasset (later Portsmouth, in the northern 
part of the island of Rhode Island; pop. in 1905,2371). As radical 
tendencies prevailed in Pocasset they removed, and in 1639 settled 
Newport at the southern end of the island (called Aquidneck 
until 1644), which they had bought from the Indians. Most of 
the founders are commemorated by place-names in the city; in 
the Coddington Burying-Ground are the tombs of Governor 
William Coddington, Governor Henry Bull, and Governor 
Nicholas Easton; and in the Coggeshall Burying-Ground John 
Coggeshall was buried. At the beginning an independent 
government by judge and elders was established (Newport and 
Portsmouth being united in 1640), but in 1647 the town was 
united with Providence, Portsmouth and Warwick in the forma- 
tion of Rhode Island according to the Williams (or, as it is 
commonly called, the Warwick) charter of 1644. During 1651- 
1654 Newport and Portsmouth were temporarily separated 
from the other two towns. About 1640 a Baptist Church was 
founded, which is probably the oldest in the United States 
except the Baptist congregation in Providence; here, too, at 
nearly the same time, one of the first free schools in America was 
opened. In 1656 English Friends settled here. Between 1739 
and 1760 great fortunes were amassed by the "Triangular 
Trade," which consisted in the exchange in Africa of rum for 
slaves, the exchange in the Barbadoes of slaves for sugar and 
molasses, and the exchange in Newport of sugar and molasses for 
rum. The destruction here on the 17th of May 1769 of the 
British revenue sloop " Liberty," formerly the property of John 
Hancock, was one of the first acts of violence leading up to the 
War of American Independence. The foreign trade of Newport, 
which in 1770 was greater than that of New York, was destroyed 
by the War of Independence. During the war the town was in the 
possession of the British from December 1776 to the 25th of 
October 1779; a plan to recover it in 1778 by a land force under 
General John Sullivan, co-operating with the French fleet under 
Count d'Estaing, came to nothing. Soon after the evacuation of 
the British, French troops, under Comte de Rochambeau, 
arrived and remained until near the end of the war, and Newport 
was a station of the French fleet in 1780-1781. The Sayer house, 
which was the headquarters of Richard Prcscott (1725-1788), 
the British general; the Vernon house, which was the head- 
quarters of Rochambeaa, and the Gibbs house, which was for 
a short time occupied by Major-General Nathanacl Greene, are 
still standing. 

Newport was chartered as a city in 1784, but in 1787 it sur- 
rendered its charter and returned to government by town meeting. 
It was rechartered as a city in 1853; the charter of this year 
was much amended in 1875 and in 1906 was superseded by 
another. Until 1900, when Providence became the sole capital, 
Newport was one of the seats of government of Rhode Island.

NEWPORT NEWS, a city and port of entry of Warwick 
county, Virginia, U.S.A., on the James River and Hampton 
Roads, 14 m. N. by W. of Norfolk and 75 m. S.E. of Richmond; 
it is situated on what is known as the Virginia Peninsula. Pop. 
(1800) 4449; (1900) 19,635, of whom 1614 were foreign-born 
and 6798 were negroes; (1910 census) 20,205. Newport 
News is served by the Chesapeake & Ohio railway, of which it is 
a terminus; by river boats to Richmond and Petersburg, Va.; 
by coastwise steamship lines to Washington, D.C., Baltimore, 
Philadelphia, New York, Boston and Providence; by foreign 
steamship lines to London, Glasgow, Liverpool, Dublin, Belfast, 
Rotterdam, Hamburg and other ports; and by electric lines to 
Old Point Comfort, Norfolk and Portsmouth. A public park 
extending from the James to the heart of the city, a deep, 
spacious and well-protected harbour, a large shipbuilding yard 
with three immense dry docks, and two large grain elevators of 
2,000,000 bushels capacity, are among the most prominent 
features; at the shipbuilding yard various United States battle- 
ships, including the " Kcarsarge," " Kentucky," " Illinois," 
" Missouri," " Louisiana," " Minnesota," " Virginia " and 
" West Virginia," were constructed, as well as cruisers, gun-boats, 
merchant vessels, ferry-boats and submarines. The city's 
export of grain and its coastwise trade in coal are especially 
large. Among the manufactures are shoes, tobacco, medicines 
and knit goods. The value of the factory products in 1905 was 
$9,053,906, being 52-5% more than in 1900. Both in 1900 and 
in 1905 Newport News ranked second to Richmond among the 
cities of the state in the value of factory products. The first 
settlement on the site of Newport News was made in 1621 by 
planters brought from Ireland by Daniel Gookin, the father 
of Daniel Gookin (1612-1687) of Massachusetts, who selected 
the site on the advice of Sir William Newce and his brother 
Captain Newce. The present city dates only from 1882, when 
it was laid out in consequence of the extension of the Chesapeake 
& Ohio railway to the coast here; it was incorporated in 1896. 
The name is said to be in honour of Christopher Newport and Sir 
William Newce. 


NEWPORT PAGNELL, a market town in the Buckingham 
parliamentary division of Buckinghamshire, England, 56 m. 
N.W. by N. of London, on a branch of the London & North- 
western railway, and at the junction of the river Ouzel with 
the Ouse. Pop. of urban district (1001) 4028. The church of 
St Paul and St Peter has Early English portions, including fine 
north and south porches. An inscription on the tomb of Thomas 
Abbott Hamilton in the churchyard is by the poet Cowper, who 
lived in the neighbouring town of Olney (g.f.). The almshouse 
called Queen Anne's Hospital is named from Anne of Denmark, 
queen of James L, who reconstituted a foundation of the time of 
Edward I., dedicated to St John the Baptist and St John the 
Evangelist. 


NEWQUAY, a seaport and watering-place, in the St Austell 
parliamentary division of Cornwall, England, 14 m. N. of Truro, 
on a branch of the Great Western railway. Pop. of urban district 
(1901) 2935. It is finely situated on the north coast, on Newquay 
Bay, which is sheltered to the west by Towan Head. The cliff 
scenery is grand, and there is a fine sandy beach along the 
northward sweep of the coast in Watergate Bay. The harbour, 
artificially constructed, and equipped with a jetty and piers, 
admits vessels of 250 tons. The chief exports arc iron and other 
ores, china clay, granite, fish and grain. The imports are coal, 
salt and manures. 


NEW ROCHELLE, a city of Westchester county, in southern 
New York, U.S.A., on Long Island Sound, 16 J m. from the Grand 
Central Station, New York City. Pop. (1890) 9057, (1000) 
14,720, of whom 4425 were foreign-born and 777 negroes; (1910 
census) 28,867. It is served by the New York, New Haven & 
Hartford Railroad, and by electric railways to New York City 
and neighbouring places. The city is primarily a residential 
suburb of New York City, and has some fine colonial residences, 
and several beautiful residential parks, notably Rochelle, 
Neptune, and Beechmont Parks. Its large foreign-born popula- 
tion is comparatively recent and comparatively isolated. Among 
the prominent buildings of the city are a public library, the high 
school, a theatre (owned by the Knights of Columbus), a Masonic 
Temple, the City Bank and several churches, of which the most 
notable, perhaps, are the Baptist, Methodist, and St Gabriel's 
(Roman Catholic), which is the gift of members of the Iselin 
family, to whose interest in yachting is due in part the prominence 
of the New Rochelle and Larchmont Yacht Clubs. The Ursuline 
College of St Angela (1904) and the Merrill School (1906), both for 
girls, are in New Rochelle. The principal building of the first 
is Leland Castle, built in 1858-1860 by Simon Leland and finely 
decorated with frescoes and coloured marbles. A People's 
Forum, growing out of the work of the People's Institute of 
New York City, was established here in 1 903-1 904. In the road 
between New Rochelle and White Plains is the monument to 
Thomas Paine, provided for in his will, on the farm which was 
confiscated from a Tory by the state and was given to him at the 
end of the American War of Independence. On the Sound, 
in Hudson Park, is a monument commemorating the landing- 
place of the first Huguenot settlers. Immediately S. of 
New Rochelle, in the Sound, is Glen Island, an amusement 
resort; belonging to the Glen Island group, E. of Pelham 
Manor, is Travers Island, with the out-of-town clubhouse and 
grounds of the New York Athletic Club. On David's Island, 
ij m. S.W. of New Rochelle, is Fort Slocum, a United States 
Army post. The suburban villages of Larchmont and Pelham 
(and Pelham Manor) lie respectively N.E. and W. of New 
Rochelle. The important industries are the manufacture of 
scales and of other instruments of precision, and printing and 
publishing — the Knickerbocker Press of G. P. Putnam's Sons, 
New York, is here. The site of New Rochelle is part of a purchase 
by Thomas Pell in 1654 and of a grant to him by Richard Nicolls 
in 1666; it was sold in 1689 to Jacob Leisler. The first settle- 
ment of importance was made in 1688 by Huguenots, some of 
whom were natives of La Rochelle. New Rochelle was incor- 
porated as a village in 1847, and as a city in 1899.

NEW ROSS, a market-town of Co. Wexford, Ireland, on the 
acclivity of a hill on the E. bank of the Barrow, 2 m. below its 
junction with the Nore, 102 m. S.S.W. of Dublin by the Dublin 
& South -Eastern railway. Pop. (1901) 5847. The Barrow 
is crossed by an iron bridge with a swivel pillar in the centre 
on which a portion of the bridge is turned to admit the passage 
of vessels. Vessels of 600 tons can lie alongside the quays. The 
inland water communications reach to Dublin by means of the 
Barrow and the Grand Canal. The Nore is navigable to Inistioge. 
New Ross has breweries and tan-yards, a salmon fishery, and a 
brisk export trade in agricultural produce. The urban district of 
New Ross includes Rosbercon, on the opposite side of the Barrow. 

It is stated that St Alban built the abbey of Rossmactreoin, 
which gave rise to an ancient city formerly called Rossglas. A 
Dominican foundation of the 13th century has left some remains 
in Rosbercon. According to Camden, New Ross was founded by 
Isabella, daughter of Strongbow and wife of William Marshal, 
afterwards earl of Pembroke. A charter was granted to it by 
Roger Bigod in the reign of Edward I., which was extended by 
James I, and James II. From 1374 it returned two members 
to parliament, but at the Union in 1800 the number was reduced 
to one, and the town ceased to be a parliamentary borough in 
1885. In 1269 it was surrounded by walls. The fortresses were 
dismantled by Cromwell, but some remains are extant. 


NEWRY, a seaport, market town and parliamentary borough 
(returning one member) of Co. Down, Ireland, on the Newry 
water and Newry canal at the extreme head of Carlingford Lough. 
Pop. (1901) 12,405. It is 73 m. N. of Dublin by the Great 
Northern railway. A railway owned by the London & North- 
western company connects Newry with the deep-water harbour 
at Greenore; and there is an electric railway to Bessbrook 
in Co. Armagh. The western part, called B ally bo t, is con- 
nected with the eastern part, or old town, by four bridges over 
the canal and four over the tidal water. The situation of the 
town is striking, the Newry Mountains and Slieve Gullion on 
the west, and the Mourne Mountains on the east, enclosing the 
narrow valley in which it lies. Newry is one of the most 
important ports of the province of Ulster, and in connexion with 
several sub-ports farther down the river is the outlet for the 
trade of a very extensive district. The port admits vessels 
of 2000 tons to Victoria Docks, 3 m. from the town, but vessels 
drawing 15 ft. can go up the ship canal to the Albert Basin, 3 m. 
from the sea. The principal exports are grain, eggs, cattle, linen 
cloth and flax, and the imports include timber, groceries and coal. 
In the neighbourhood granite of a fine quality is quarried, and 
the town possesses rope and sail works, breweries, distilleries, 
flour-mills and tanneries. It is governed by an urban district 
council. In 11 75 an abbey was founded here by Maurice 
M'Loughlin, king of Ireland. The abbey was converted in 1543 
into a collegiate church for secular priests, and was dissolved by 
Edward VI., who granted it to Sir Nicholas Bagenal, marshal of 
Ireland. Bagenal made it his private residence, and laid the 
foundations of its prosperity. In 1689 Newry was set on fire by 
the duke of Berwick when in retreat before Schomberg. Charters 
were granted to the town by James I. and James II. By the 
charter of James I. it sent two members to parliament, but at the 
Union in 1800 it was restricted to one member. Until 1898 a 
portion of Newry was situated in Co. Armagh. A mile N.E. of 
the town is a notable rath or enclosure, taking its name of 
Crown rath from traditional single encounters between native 
princes in contention for the sovereignty. 

NEW SIBERIA ARCHIPELAGO, a group of islands situated 
off the Arctic coast of Siberia, from 73 to 76 6' N., and 135° 20' 
to 148° E. The name is loosely applied, covering either the 
northern group only of these islands, for which the name of New 
Siberia Archipelago, or of Anjou Islands, ought properly to be 
reserved, or the southern group as well, which ought to maintain 
its name of Lyakhov Islands. Some confusion prevails also as 
to whether the islands Bennett, Henrietta and Jeannette, dis- 
covered by the " Jeannette " expedition, ought to be included in 
the same archipelago, or described separately as the Jeannette 
Islands. The first of these three belongs geographically, and 
probably geologically, to New Siberia Archipelago, from which 
it is only 97 m. distant. As to Henrietta and Jeannette Islands, 
situated 200 m. N.E. of New Siberia Island, in 157 to 159 E., 
they can hardly be included in the New Siberia Archipelago. 
There seems, moreover, to be land due north of Kotelnyi Island 
in 78 N., first sighted by Sannikov and described as Sannikov 
Land. It was also seen by Baron Toll. 

The New Siberia or Anjou Islands consist, beginning from the 
west, of Kotelnyi, the largest (116 m. long, 100 m. wide), having the 
small island Byelkovskiy near its western shore; Thaddeus (Fad- 
deevskiy), in the middle; and New Siberia (Novaya Sibir), in the 
east (90 m. long, 40 m. wide). Kotelnyi is the highest and most 
massive of the four, reaching a maximum altitude of 1200 ft. in the 
Malakatyn-tras mountain. Its north-east portion consists of Upper 
Silurian coral limestones (Llandovery division), containing a rich 
fossil fauna and representing a series of folds running north-north- 
west. The same Silurian deposits are widely spread on the mainland 
as far as Olenek. The western portion of Kotelnyi is built up of 
Middle Devonian limestones and slates, folded the same way, of which 
the fossil fauna is similar to that of the Urals. Triassic slates appear 
in the south-east. Diabases pierce to Devonian rocks, and olivine 
rocks appear as dykes amidst the Triassic deposits. The Malakatyn- 
tras is also made up of volcanic rocks. The eastern portion of the 
island, named Bunge's Land, is thickly covered with Post-Tertiary 
deposits. Thaddeus Island has a long promontory, Anjou, protrud- 
ing north-westwards. New Siberia Island attains altitudes of 200 
to 300 ft. in its western portion. A range of hills, composed of 
Tertiary deposits, and named Hedenstrom s Mountains, runs along 
its south-western coast, and the same rocks form a promontory 
protruding northwards. The so-called Wood Mountains, which 
were supposed to be accumulations of floating wood, are denudations 
of Miocene deposits containing layers of brown coal with full stems 
of trees. These Tertiary deposits are characterized by a rich fauna; 
fully developed leaves of poplars, numerous fruits of the mammoth 
tree, needles of several coniters, &c, being found in them, thus 
testifying to a climate once very much warmer. The only repre- 
sentative of tree vegetation now is a dwarf willow i in. high. 

The Lyakhov Islands consist of the Bolshoy (Large), or Blizhniy 
(Nearest), which is separated by Laptev Strait, 27 m. wide, from 
Svyatoy Nos of Siberia; Malyi (Small), or Dalniy (Farthest), to 
the north-west of Blizhniy; and three smaller islands — Stolbovyi 
(Pillars), Semenovskiy and Vasilevskiy — to the west of Malyi. 
Dr Bunge found Bolshoy to consist of granite protruding from be- 
neath non-fossiliferous deposits; while the promontory of Svyatoy 
Nos consists of basalt hills, 1400 ft. high. Along the southern coast 
of Bolshoy Baron Toll found immense layers of fossil ice, 70 ft. 
thick, evidently relics from the Ice Age, covered by an upper layer 
of Post-Tertiary deposits containing numbers of perfectly well- 
preserved mammoth remains, rhinoceros, Ovibos, and bones of 
the horse, reindeer, American stag, antelope, saiga and even the 
tiger. The proof that these animals lived -and fed in this latitude 
(73 20' N)., at a time when the islands were not yet separated from 
the continent, is given by the relics of forest vegetation which are 
found in the same deposits. A stem of Alnus fruticosa, 90 ft. high, 
was found with all its roots and even fruits. 

Basalts and Tertiary brown coal deposits enter into the com- 
position of the southern extremity of Bennett Island, and the 
mountains of Sannikov Land, seen by Toll, have the aspect of 
basaltic " table mountains." 

The climate of these islands is very severe. In 1886 the winter 
ended only in June, to begin anew in August (21st May, -5-8° 
F.; 16th October, -34-6°). The highest summer temperature 
was 50 . Flocks of geese and other birds come to the islands 
from the north (Bunge and Toll), as also the gull Lestrispomarina, 
which feeds chiefly on the lemming. The lemmings are very 
numerous, and in certain years undertake migrations to the 
mainland and back. Reindeer, followed by wolves, come also 
every year to the islands; the polar fox and polar bear, both 
feeding on the lemmings, are numerous. Hunters come in 
numbers to the Lyakhovs, which must have been long known 
to Arctic hunters. 

A Yakutsk Cossack, named Vaghin, wintered on Bolshoy 
in 1 71 2, hut it was a merchant, Lyakhov, who first described 
the two greater islands of this group in 1770, and three years 
later reached on sledges the largest island of the New Siberia 
group, which he named Kotelnyi. The Lyakhovs were mapped 
in 1777. J. Sannikov, with a party of hunters, discovered in 
1 805-1 808 Stolbovyi, Thaddeus and New Siberia Islands, and 
a merchant, Byelkov, the Byelkovskyi Islands. He sighted 
the land to the north of Kotelnyi and the land to the north 
of New Siheria (now Bennett Island). A Russian officer named 
Hedenstrom, accompanied by Sannikov, explored the archi- 
pelago and published a map of it in 181 1. Lieutenant Anjou 
visited it in 1821-1823. A scientific expedition under Dr 
Alexander Bunge (including Baron Eduard Toll) explored it in 
1885-1886. Baron Toll revisited it in 1893 with Lieutenant 
Shileiko, and again in 1900 with F. G. Seeberg. Papers were 
found on Bennett Island showing that he left it for the south in 
November 1902, but he never returned home, and two relief 
parties in 1903 failed to find traces of him.

NEW SOUTH WALES, a state of the Australian Common- 
wealth. The name was given by Captain Cook, in his exploratory 
voyage in 1770, to the southern portion of the eastern coast of 
Australia, from some imagined resemblance of its coast-line to 
that of South Wales. The name was afterwards extended to 
the eastern half of Australia, but now designates a much more 
restricted area. New South Wales is bounded by the Pacific 
Ocean on the E., by Queensland on the N., by South Australia 
on the W. and by Victoria on the S. It lies between 28 and 
38 S. lat., and 141 and 154 E. long. The coast-line, which 
is ahout 700 m. in length, extends from Cape Howe (37 30') 
at the south-eastern corner of Australia to Point Danger in 
28 i S. The colony is approximately rectangular in form, 
with an average depth from the coast of 650 m. and an average 
width from north to south of 500 m. The superficial area is 
estimated at 310,700 sq. m., or ahout one-tenth of the whole of 
Australia. 

Physical Configuration. — The surface of the state is divided 
naturally into three distinct zones, each widely differing in general 
character and physical aspect, and clearly defined by the Great 
Dividing Range running from north to south. The tableland, 
which forms the summit of the range, comprises one of the three 
zones and separates the other zones, viz. the coastal region, and 
the great plain district of the interior. The main range follows 
the line of the coast, varying from 30 to 140 m. distant, heing 
nearest at the south and receding the farthest at the sources 
of the Goulburn river, the main tributary of the Hunter. The 
crest of this range is, in some places, narrow; in others it spreads 
out into a wide tableland. The eastern slopes are, as a rule, 
rugged and precipitous, but the western versant falls gently 
to plains. The highest part of the Dividing Range is in the 
south-eastern portions of the state, on the borders of Victoria. 
Here some of the peaks rise to a height of over 7000 ft.; one of 
these, Mount Kosciusco, the highest peak in Australia, attains 
an elevation of 7328 ft. The tableland varies greatly in elevation, 
but nowhere does it fall below 1500 ft., and in places it reaches 
an average of 5000 ft. The great plain district, lying west of the 
tableland, is part of a vast basin which comprises portions of 
Queensland, South Australia and Victoria, as well as of New 
South Wales. The great plains are traversed by a few rivers, 
whose long and uncertain courses carry their waters to the river 
Murray, which empties itself into the Southern Ocean through 
the state of South Australia, and during 1250 m. of its course 
forms the boundary between the states of New South Wales 
and Victoria. The Murray has a very tortuous course, as may 
be judged from the fact that the measurement along the joint 
boundary of New South Wales and Victoria is only 460 m. in a 
straight line, the river course being 1250. The chief tributaries 
of the Murray are the Darling and the Murrumbidgee, which is 
joined by the Lachlan. The Murray and the Murrumbidgee are 
permanent streams, but the Darling occasionally ceases to run 
in part of its course, and for a thousand miles above its junction 
with the Murray it receives no tributary. In its upper course 
the Darling receives numerous tributaries. Those on the right 
bank all come from Queensland and bring down enormous 
volumes of water in flood time; on the left bank the most im- 
portant tributaries are the Gwydir, Namoi, Castlereagh, Bogan 
and Macquarie. Here and there along the course of the western 
rivers are found lagoons, sometimes of considerable dimensions. 
These are commonly called lakes, but are in reality shallow 
depressions receiving water from the overflow of the rivers in 
times of flood, and in return feeding them when the floods have 
subsided. 

The coastal helt differs greatly from the other divisions of 
the state. The main range gives rise to numerous rivers flowing 
eastward to the South Pacific. Almost everywhere between the 
main range and the sea the country is hilly and serrated, more 
particularly in the southern portions of the state. In the Illa- 
warra district, 50 m. south of Sydney, the mountains skirt the 
very edge of the coast, but farther north there is a wider coast- 
land, with greater stretches of country available for tillage and 
pasture. 

Along the sea-board are twenty-two well-defined headlands 
or capes and about a score of bays or inlets, to mark which for 
navigators there are thirty-four lighthouses. There are four 
very fine natural harhours, viz. Jervis Bay, Port Jackson, 
Broken Bay and Port Stephens, and several others of minor im- 
portance. Port Jackson, on which is situated the city of Sydney, 
is one of the six greatest ports of the Britjsh empire. The 
port second of commercial importance to Sydney is Newcastle, 
at the mouth of the Hunter river, which is the great coal-shipping 
port of the colony. Secondary harbours, available for coasting 
steamers, south of Sydney are at Port Hacking, Wollongong, 
Kiama, Shoalhaven, Bateman's Bay, UHadulIa, Merimbula, 
and Twofold Bay. North of Sydney the secondary ports are 
at the mouths of the Hawkesbury, Manning, Hastings, Macleay, 
Nambucca, Bellingen, Clarence, Richmond and Tweed rivers. 
The rivers of the sea-board are as just enumerated, the only other 
of importance being the Hunter. The Richmond drains an area 
of 2400 sq. m. and is navigable for 60 m. The Clarence is a fine 
stream draining an area of 8000 sq. m.; it has a course of 
240 m. navigable for 67 m. The Macleay drains an area of 4800 
sq. m., and empties at Trial Bay after a course of 200 m., of 
which 20 m. are navigable. The Hastings and Manning are both 
important rivers. The Hunter is one of the chief rivers of the 
state and embouches at Port Hunter or Newcastle Harbour after 
a course of 200 m. It drains an area of 11,000 sq. m., more than 
twice the area of the Thames basin. Less commercially important 
than the Hunter, the Hawkesbury is nevertheless a fine stream; 
it has a course of 330 m., of which 70 m. are navigable. South 
of Sydney the rivers are of less importance; the principal is the 
Shoalhaven, 260 m. long, draining an area of 3300 sq. m. 

Climate. — The three geographical regions above described 
constitute three distinct climatic divisions. The coastal region, 
28 to 37 S. lat., shows a difference between the average summer 
and winter temperatures of only 24 Fahrenheit. Sydney, which 
is situated midway between the extreme points of the state 
(33° 5 r ' S.), has a mean temperature of 63 , the mean summer 
temperature being 71 and that of winter 54 , showing a mean 
range of 17 ; the highest temperature in the shade experienced 
at Sydney in 1896 was 108-5°, an ^ the lowest 35*9. The coastal 
district has an area of 38,000 sq. m., over which there is an 
average rainfall of 42 in. The rainfall is greatest at the sea-board, 
diminishing inland; the fall also diminishes from north to south. 
Sydney has an average fall of 50 in., while the Clarence Heads, 
in the north, has 58 in., and Eden, in the south, 35-5 in. The 
tableland is a distinct climatic region. On the high southern 
plateau, at an elevation of 4640 ft., stands the town of Kiandra, 
with a mean summer temperature of 56-4° and winter of 32*5°. 
Cooma, in the centre of the Monaro plains, at an elevation of 
2637 ft., has a mean summer temperature of 65-9° and winter, 
41*7°; its summers are therefore as mild as those of London 
or Paris, while its winters are much less severe. On the New 
England tableland, under latitude 30° S., the yearly average 
temperature is 56-5°, the mean summer 67*7° and the mean 
winter 44-3°. The tablelands cover an area of 85,000 sq. m, 
and have an average rainfall of 32-6 in.; there is, however, a 
small area in the southern portion where an average fall of 64 in. 
is experienced. In the western division, or great plains, severe 
heat is experienced throughout the summer, and on occasional 
days the thermometer in the shade ranges above ioo° Fahrenheit, 
but it is a dry heat and more easily borne than a much less degree 
of temperature at the sea-board. The mean summer temperature 
ranges between 75° at Dcniliquin in the south and 84° at Bourke. 
The mean range in winter is between 48 and 54-5°, and, accom- 
panied as this is with clear skies, the season is very refreshing. 
West of the tableland the amount of rainfall decreases as the 
distance from the Pacific increases, and in a large area w T est of 
the Darling the average annual rainfall does not exceed 10 in. 
For the whole western division, embracing an area of 188,000 
sq. m., the average rainfall is 19-8 in. (T. A. C.) 

Geology. — New South Wales consists geologically as well as geo- 
graphically of three main divisions which traverse the state from 
north to south. The highlands of eastern Australia form the middle 
belt of the state, to the east of which are the low coastal districts 
and to the west the wide western plains. The highlands of New 
South Wales consist, geographically, of a series of tablelands, now 
in the condition of dissected peneplains; geologically, they are 
built of a foundation of Archean and folded Lower Palaeozoic rocks t 
covered in places by sheets of more horizontal Upper Palaeozoic 
and Mesozoic rocks; these deposits occur along the edge of the 
1 highlands, and are widely distributed on the floor of the coastal 
districts. They have been lowered to this level by a monoclinal fold, 
which has brought down the Mesozoic rocks, so that they extend 
eastward to the coast, where they dip beneath the sea. The western 
plains contain isolated ridges of the old Archean and Lower Palaeo- 
zoic rocks; but in the main, they consist of plains of Cretaceous 
beds covered by Cainozoic drifts. The stratified rocks in the high- 
lands strike north and south, as if they had been crumpled into folds, 
in Upper Palaeozoic times, by pressure from east to west. The weak 
areas in the crust caused by the earth movements were invaded by 
great masses of Devonian granites. They altered the Lower Palaeo- 
zoic rocks on their edges, and were once thought to have converted 
wide areas of Lower Palaeozoic rocks into schists and gneisses. 
Most of these foliated rocks, however, are doubtless of Archean age. 
The highland rocks no doubt once extended along the whole length 
of the state from north to south; but they arc now crossed by a 
band of Upper Palaeozoic sediments, which extend up to the valley 
of the Hunter river and separate the Blue Mountains and the 
Southern Highlands of New South Wales from the New England 
tableland to the north. 

The oldest rocks in New South Wales are referrable to the Archean 
system, and consist of gneisses and schists, including the glauco- 
phane-schists in the New* England tableland, and hornblende- 
schists of Berthong. The Archean rocks are comparatively sparsely 
exposed in New South Wales. They enter the state from the south, 
being continuous with the Archean block of north-eastern Victoria. 
They occupy a large area in the western districts of New South 
Wales, where a projection from the Archean plateau of central 
Australia crosses into the state from South Australia; it is best 
exposed in the Barrier Ranges around Broken Hill. Cambrian rocks 
have not yet been discovered in New South Wales; but Pittman 
has recorded an Agnoslus from Mandurama, near Orange. The 
rocks of the Ordovician system, though widely distributed, have not 
always been separated from the Silurian rocks, which they often 
closely resemble lithologically. The occurrence of Ordovician rocks 
was first established by Dun at Tomingley, 3$ m. S.W. of Dubbo, 
where he discovered graptolites that he identified as Climacograptus 
and Dicellograplus. Other graptolites have been found near Orange, 
and at Lyndhurst, near Carcoar. The fossilifcrous horizon is of 
Upper Ordovician age. The extent of the Ordovician will probably 
be increased by addition of areas, which cannot yet be separated 
from the Silurian. The Silurian system is the best-known con- 
stituent of the Lower Palaeozoic foundation of New South Wales. 
The rocks consist of sandstones, quartzites, slates and shales, asso- 
ciated with lenticular masses of limestone. The typical Silurian rocks 
are richly fossiliferous, the shales containing tnlobites, the sand- 
stones many brachiopods, and the limestones a rich coral and bryo- 
zoan fauna. There are also beds of chert, which are largely composed 
of radiolaria. Caves have been dissolved in the limestones by under- 
ground streams; the Jcnolan caves in the Blue Mountains and 
those of Yarrangobilly and the Goulburn district are the most famous. 
The slates of the Silurian have been bent into folds, and saddle reefs 
occur along the axis of the folds, as at Hargraves. Numerous 
quartz reefs occur both in the Silurian and Ordovician rocks. In 
these reefs the chief mineral is gold. Some schists, attributed to 
the Silurian, but possibly older, contain platinum; and associated 
with the limestones are beds of copper. 

The rocks of the Devonian system rest unconformably upon the 
Silurian; but some beds of which the age is still uncertain are 
called Devono-Silurian. The Devonian beds are well developed in 
the Blue Mountains, where the lower Devonian sediments at Mount 
Lambie are estimated to be 10,000 ft. in thickness. They are ex- 
tensively developed . along the Cox river and along the slopes of 
Mount Canoblas. They are also developed in the New South Wales 
highlands, to the south-east of Goulburn. Some of the best-known 
exposures are in the ranges which rise above the western plains, 
such as the Rankin Range on the Darling and the Kokopara Range 
to the north of the Murrumbidgee. The Devonian rocks at Yalwal 
are sharply folded and are associated with a series of rhyolites and 
basic lavas. The lower part of this series is probably Lower De- 
vonian; and it is covered by shales and volcanic rocks belonging 
to the Upper Devonian. In the extreme south-cast of New South 
Wales, at the head of the Genoa river, are sandstones with Archaeo* 
pteris howitti, which are an extension of the Lower Devonian beds 
of Victoria; while farther to the east, at Eden and Twofold Bay, 
are Upper Devonian sandstones. 

The Devonian system is separated from the Carboniferous by an 
interval, during which there were powerful earth movements; they 
produced a lofty mountain chain, running north and south across 
New South Wales. The highlands are the worn down stumps of 
this mountain line. In Lower Carboniferous times these mountains 
were snow-capped, and the valleys on their flanks were occupied by 
glaciers. 

The Lower Carboniferous beds are represented by conglomerates 
and sandstones with some shales and limestones. The sandstones 
are characterized by Lepidodendron (Bergeria) auslrale. It is asso- 
ciated with beds of lava and volcanic ash, some of which contain 
copper ores. Granites and granodiorites were intruded at this period 
into the older rocks, and altered the adjacent Devonian beds into 
slates and quartzites, and formed gold-quartz veins, which have 
been worked in the Devonian rocks "at Yalwal. The Lower Carboni- 
ferous rocks also occur in the Blue Mountains^ along the Cox river 
and Capertee river; and a northern continuation occurs along the 
western slope of the New England tableland, from the Macintyre 
river to the Queensland border.

The Upper Carboniferous rocks are most important from their 
rich seams of coal. They occupy from 24,000 to 28,000 sq. m., 
which are best exposed in the Hunter river and around Newcastle. 

Farther south they disappear beneath the Mesozoic sandstones, 
from which they again rise along the coast around Lake Illawarra 
.and near the mouth of the Shoathaven river. The Coal Measures 
have been reached under Sydney, by a deep bore at Balmain, which 
pierced a seam of coal 10 ft. thick, at the depth of 2917 ft. The Coal 
Measures are classified by Professor T. W. David as follows: — 

	Ft. 
	1. Upper or Newcastle Coal Measures, containing 
	an aggregate of about 100 ft. of coal . 
	2. Dempsey Series ; freshwater beds, containing 
	no productive coal. This series thins out 
	completely in certain directions . 
	Middle, or Tomago, or East Maitland Coal 
	Measures, containing an aggregate of about 
	40 ft. of coal ...... 
	Upper Marine Series; specially characterized by 
	the predominance of Productus brachythaerus 5,000 
	Lower or Greta Coal Measures, containing an 
	aggregate of about 20 ft. of coal .

Geologically, perhaps, the most interesting rocks in the Carbon- 
iferous are the glacial conglomerates, containing ice-scratched, 
erratic blocks. Some of the boulders are encrusted by marine 
organisms and must have been dropped by icebergs in the sea. The 
northern limit of the glacial beds is in dispute; they have been 
•described as far north as Ashford. The Carboniferous beds contain 
numerous sheets and flows of basalt and andesite. A syenite massif 
of this age occurs at Mittagong; and leucite has been discovered in 
Carboniferous basalts by David. 

The Mesozoic rocks of New South Wales begin with the Narrabeen 
Shales; they are covered by the Hawkesbury Sandstones, which are 
well exposed around Sydney; and they in turn are covered by the 
Wianamatta Shales. The Triassic age of the Hawkesbury Sand- 
stone is supported by the evidence of the fossil fish; though, accord- 
ing to Dr Smith Woodward^they may perhaps be Rhaetic. But the 
fossil plants of which the chief are Taeniopteris daintreei and Thinn- 
Jeldia odontopteroides are regarded by Seward as Lower Jurassic. 
At Talbragar there is a bed containing Jurassic fish, which rests in an 
erosion hollow in the Hawkesbury Sandstone. The Talbragar beds, 
then, may be representative of the Jurassic; and the underlying 
Hawkesbury Sandstone may be Upper Triassic. The Cretaceous 
-system is widely developed in the western part of the state, where it 
is represented by two divisions. The Rolling Downs formation is 
regarded as Lower Cretaceous. It consists of a thick series of shales 
containing marine fossils. It is covered in places by tablelands and 
ridges of the Desert Sandstone, the remnants of a sheet which 
doubtless once covered the whole of the Western Plains. The chief 
economic product of the Desert Sandstone is opal, which occurs in it 
at White Cliffs and Wileannia. The opal beds contain Cretaceous 
fossils such as Cimoliosaurus. An occurrence of Upper Cretaceous 
beds occurs in the coastal district at Nimbin on the Richmond river. 
The Cainozoic rocks are best developed in the western districts, as 
the silts of the Darling and Murray plains. They include some 
Miocene, or perhaps Oli^ocene marine sands, formed in the northern 
part of an inland sea, which occupied the basin of the Lower Murray. 
The most significant point in the distribution of the marine Cainozoic 
rocks in New South Wales is their complete absence from the coastal 
districts; this fact indicates that while the Middle Cainozoic marine 
beds of Victoria and New Guinea were being deposited, Australia 
extended far eastward into the Tasman Sea. The Cainozoic scries of 
New South Wales contains many interesting volcanic rocks, including 
leucite-basalts, nepheline-basalts and sodalite-basalts. In a basic 
neck of this period at Inverell, there are eclogite boulders, containing 
diamonds in situ; and it is doubtless from these basic volcanic necks 
that the dia-monds of the New England tableland have been derived. 
The volcanic rocks occur on the tableland of New South Wales, and 
contribute much to the fertility of their soils. 

The most important mineral in New South Wales is coal, of which 
the state has probably a larger available supply than any other 
country in the southern hemisphere. The coal-fields occupy 24,000 
sq. m. The coal is present in such vast amount as to offer the 
possibility of very economical working of the abundant iron ores of 
Australia. Kerosene shale occurs in the Blue Mountains to the west 
of Sydney, in the Upper Carboniferous rocks. Gold is widely 
distributed through the highlands. It was first recorded by James 
McBrien in 1823, as occurring in grains in the sands of the Fish river, 
between Rydal and Bathurst; and though further discoveries were 
made, they were kept secret as far as possible. The first discovery 
of gold in mining quantities was made by Hargraves in 1 851, at the 
junction of Lewis Ponds and Summerhill Creek, in what was called the 
Ophir Diggings, near Bathurst. The gold mines are very numerous 
and widely scattered, but individually they are mostly small and of 
no great depth. The total value of the gold raised since 1850 is over 
£50,000,000. The output of alluvial gold is now increased by the 
employment of dredges. The gold-quartz veins are mainly in the 
Ordovician and Silurian rocks ; but some also occur in the Devonian, 
and there are impregnations of gold in tufas of Devonian age. Deep 
leads beneath the basalts occur at Kiandra. 

The silver-lead mines of New South Wales are famous owing to the 
importance of Broken Hill. The mines there occur in gneiss and 
schists, which are probably of Archean age; the lode has in places 
been worked for a width of over 200 ft. The zinc ores associated 
with the silver-lead long lay unutilized, as the problem of their 
separation from the associated rhodonite has only recently been 
overcome. Tin is worked in the rivers of the New England tableland 
as at Vegetable Creek. The chief copper field is at Cobar in the 
north-western plains. Bismuth, platinum, molybdenum and anti- 
mony are obtained in small quantities. 

The geology_of New South Wales has been described in the Mono- 
graphs, Memoirs and Records of the Geological Survey, which in the 
fullness and high scientific character form the most valuable contri- 
bution to Australasian geology. Pittman's map of the state in two 
sheets, on the scale of 16 m. to the inch, was issued by the Survey in 
1893. The economic geology has been admirably summarized in a 
work by E. F. Pittman, The Mineral Resources of New South Wales 
(1901). Numerous geological memoirs have appeared in the Rep. 
Austral. Assoc, for the Advancement of Science, the Journ. R. Soc. 
N.S. Wales and the Proc. of the Linnaean Soc. N.S. Wales. A 
systematic account of the minerals has been published by A. 
Liversidge, The Minerals of New South Wales (1888), and to him is 
due a valuable chemical study of the meteorites and gold nuggets. 
Contributions on the palaeontology of New South Wales are con- 
tained in the Rec. Austral. Museum, Sydney. A bibliography of the 
economic geography has been issued by W. S. Dun, Rec. Geol. Surv. 
N.S. Wales, vol. vi., 1899, and of the Cretaceous geology, also by 
W. S. Dun, in Journ. of P roc. Royal Soc. N.S. Wales, 1903, vol. 
xxxvii. pp. 140-153. (J. W. G.) 

Artesian Water. — Before actual boring proved that the belief was 
well founded, it had long been scientifically demonstrated that water 
would probably be obtained in the Cretaceous formation which 
underlies the whole of the north-west of New South Wales; and it is 
probable that the artesian water-bearing basin extends much 
farther south than was previously supposed. It may, indeed, be yet 
found to extend approximately along the course of the Lower 
Darling. Artesian water is also obtainable in other than Cretaceous 
rocks. This is shown by palaeontologieal evidence; and some of the 
most successful bores, such as those at Coonamble, Moree, Gil Gil 
and Euroka, have pierced rocks of Triassic age, corresponding with 
the Ipswich Coal Measures. 

Population. — The population on the 1st of July 1006 was 
1,504,700, viz. 799,260 males and 705,440 females. The total 
includes 105,000 Chinese and 7500 aborigines and half-castes. 
Since i860 New South Wales had added more largely to its 
population than any of the other Australian states. In i860 
the population was 348,546; in 1890 the number was 1,121,860. 
From 1890 to 1901 the population increased 238,083, or at the 
rate of 21*2%. By far the largest part of the increase is due 
to excess of births over deaths, for out of the increase of over 
1,000,000 since i860, only 350,000 was due to immigration. In 

1905 there were 39*572 births and 14,980 deaths; these figures 
are equal to 26-78 and 10-13 Per thousand respectively. The 
birth-rate has fallen very much, especially since 1899. In 1861- 
1865 it was 4 2 *7i per 1000; in 1896-1899 it was 27-92, and in 

1906 it had fallen still further to 26*78. The marriage rate for 

1905 was 7*40 per thousand, and the persons married 14*80 
per thousand. The mean for 20 years was 7*39. The chief 
cities are Sydney and suburbs, population in 1906, 535,000; 
Newcastle and suburbs, 56,000; Broken Hill, 30,000; in 1901, 
Parramatta, 12,568; Goulburn, 10,610; and Maitland (East 
and West), 10,085. There are nine other towns with between 
5000 and 10,000 inhabitants each. 

Religion. — The proportions of the leading denominations in 1 90 1 
were :— Church of England, <i6-6 % ; Roman Catholic, 26*0 ; 
Presbyterian, 9*9; Wesleyan ana other Methodists, 10*3; Congre- 
gationalist, i*q; Baptist, 1*2; Jews, 0-5; others, 3-6. Sydney is 
the seat of Anglican and Roman Catholic archbishoprics; the 
Anglican archbishop is also primate of Australia and Tasmania. 

Education. — The state has in its employ 3*35 male and 2424 
female teachers, and maintains 2901 schools. The law requires that 
all children over six years and under fourteen years shall attend 
school, and in 1904, 220,000 children of these ages, as well as 39,000 
others below or beyond the school ages, were receiving instruction, 
making a total of 259,000. Of this number 211,000 were in state 
schools and 48,000 in private schools. The majority of the private 
schools are controlled by one or other of the religious bodies. The 
Roman Catholic Church has 361 schools, with 1835 teachers and an 
attendance of 33,000 pupils. The total expenditure of the state on 
public instruction, science and art during the year ended 30th June 

1906 was £911,000. During the calendar year 1906 a sum of £840,000 
was expended on primary instruction. The fees from pupils 
sources, viz. taxation; sale and lease of lands; earnings of railways, 
tramways and other services; and share of surplus revenue returned 
by the commonwealth. During 1906 the income derived under 
each of these heads was: from taxation £1 ,297,776; from lands 
£1,729,887; from railways and other services £5,856,826; from 
commonwealth £2,742,770; these with miscellaneous collections to 
the amount of £055323 made up a total revenue of £12,283,082. 
The direct taxation is represented by a tax of one penny in the 
pound on the unimproved value of land, sixpence in the pound on 
the annual income derived in the state from all sources, except the 
use and occupation of land and improvements thereon. There are 
also various stamp duties. The land revenue is derived partly from 
the alienation of the public estate, either absolutely or under con- 
ditions, but mainly from the occupation of the public lands. There 
is also a small revenue from mining lands, timber licences, &c. The 
state still holds 146 million acres out of a total of 196 million acres, 
having alienated about 50 million acres. The principal heads of ex- 
penditure were: interest and charges on public debt, £3,291,059; 
public instruction, £911,177; working expenses of railways and 
tramways, £2,954,777; other services working expenses, £208,242; 
other services, £3.900.726. The public debt in 1906 was £85,641 ,734, 
equal to £56, us. per inhabitant; the great proportion of this debt 
has been incurred tor works that are revenue producing, only about 
£11,000,000 was not so expended. Of the total debt in 1903 about 
£66,000,000 was held in London. The net return from public works 
in excess of expenditure in 1906 amounted to nearly $1% on the 
whole public debt, and the interest paid averages 3-6%. 

Administration. — The political constitution of New South 
Wales is that of a self-governing British colony, and rests on the 
provisions of the Constitution Act. The governor is appointed 
by the crown, the term of office being generally for five years, 
and the salary £5000. The governor is the official medium of 
communication between the colonial government and the 
secretary for the colonies, but at the same time the colony 
maintains its own agent-general in London, who not only sees to 
all its commercial business but communicates with the colonial 
office. The powers of the state parliament have been since 
1 901 restricted by the transfer of certain powers to the common- 
wealth of Australia. In the legislative assembly there are 90 
members. The principle adopted in distributing the representa- 
tion is that of equal electoral districts, modified in practice by a 
preference given to the distant and rural constituencies at the 
cost of the metropolitan electorates. The suffrage qualification 
is a residence of twelve months and the attainment of the age 
of 21 years. Women are entitled to the franchise: there are 
the usual restrictions in regard to the pauper and criminal 
classes. An elector has only one vote, which is attached to the 
district in which he resides. Members of the Legislative Assembly 
are allowed a salary of £300 a year. There were in 1906 about 
700,000 electors. Each electoral district returns one member. 
The Legislative Council consists of persons nominated for life 
by the governor, acting on the advice of the Executive Council; 
the number of members is not fixed by law but in 1906 it was 55. 
Parliaments are triennial. Local government was extended in 
1905 and 1906 to the whole state, excepting the sparsely popu- 
lated western division; formerly it was confined to an area of 
about 2800 sq. m. There are altogether about 55,000 m. of 
road communications, but not more than 15,000 m. are properly 
formed. The various local bodies are municipalities or shires, 
the former is the term applied to closely peopled areas of small 
extent endowed with complete local government, and the latter 
is the designation of the more extensive districts, thinly peopled, 
to which a less complete system of local government has been 
granted. 

Federal Capital. — In 1908 the Seat of Government Act pro- 
vided that the federal territory and capital of Australia should 
be in the Yass-Canberra district of New South Wales, and that 
the territory should have an area of not less than 900 sq. m. and 
easy access to the sea. In 1909 a Board appointed to consider 
the several possible sites within this district reported in favour 
of Canberra, on the Molonglo river, near Queanbeyan, as the 
site for the new city, and the basins of the Molonglo, Queanbeyan 
and Cotter rivers were indicated as suitable to form the federal 
territory. Jervis Bay was recommended as offering a site for a 
port for the territory. Bills were passed in 1909 by the legis- 
lative assembly of New &>uth Wales and by the federal parlia- 
ment, transferring this territory to the federation. 

Agriculture. — New South Wales might be described as essentially 
a pastoral country, and the cultivation of the soil has always been 
secondary to stock-raising. But the predominance of the pastoral 
industry is not by any means so marked as it was even as late as the 
last decade of the 19th century. The want of progress in agriculture 
was not to be ascribed to defects of climate or soil, but chiefly to 
the great distance of Australia from the markets of the world. This 
difficulty has, for the most part, been removed by the establishment 
of numerous important lines of steamers trading between Australia 
and Europe, and recent years have therefore seen considerable 
expansion in all forms of agriculture. 

In 1882 the area of land under cultivation was 733,582 acres, 
which is slightly less than 1 acre per inhabitant. In 1900 the total 
area under cultivation was 2,439,639 acres, and in 1906 it had risen 
to 2,838,081 acres, which is a little short of 2 acres per inhabitant. 

The area devoted to each of the principal crops was as follows : — 

	+------------+-----------+
	|            |   Acres.  |
	+------------+-----------+
	| Wheat      | 1,939,400 |
	| Maize      |   189,000 |
	| Oats       |    38,500 |
	| Sugar Cane |    21,500 |
	| Hay        |   438,000 |
	| Vines      |     8,100 |
	+------------+-----------+

The average yield per acre of crops may be set down as follows: — 

	Bushels. 
	Wheat 10-5 
	Maize 30 
	Oats 23 
	Sugar Cane .... 20 tons, cane 
	Hay 1 ton 
	Wine 185 gallons 

The total value of production in the year 1906 may be set down 
a t £6,543,000, which works out at £2, 6s. id. per acre. 

Although the coastal districts are still important, as the crops 
yielding the largest returns per acre are grown there, as regards the 
total area under crop these districts are of much less importance 
compared with the whole state than formerly. 

The area under crop on the coast districts is about 320,000 acres ; 
on the tablelands 375,000 acres; on the western slopes, 1,100,000 
acres; the Riverina district, 750,000 acres; the western plains, 
chiefly in the central portion, 270,000 acres; and less than 20,000 
acres in the western division, which comprises nearly half the total 
area of the state. The soil in that part of the country is, for the most 
part, suitable for cultivation, and there arc large areas of rich land, 
but the rainfall is too light and irregular for the purpose of 
agriculture. 

There were 76 f ooo occupiers of rural holdings in 1905, and the 
area occupied by them, exclusive of lands leased from the state, is 
48,081,000 acres. The great majority, 80% in 1905, of occupiers 
are freeholders; the practice of renting farm lands is not followed 
to any considerable extent, except in the dairying lands on the coast 
district. New South Wales took up its position amongst wheat- 
exporting countries in 1900; the bulk of the grain exported goes to 
the United Kingdom. Hay crops and maize rank next in importance 
to wheat. The cultivation of fruit is receiving increased attention, 
but the growing of sugar cane and tobacco and the production of 
wine, until recently so promising, are, if not declining, at least 
stationary, in spite of the suitability of the soil of many districts 
for these crops. 

Grazing and Dairying. — The grazing industry still holds a chief 
place amongst the productive industries of the state. In 1906 the 
number of horses was 507,000; of sheep, 40,000,000; of cattle, 
2,340,000; and swine, 311,000. There were considerable losses of 
sheep in 1902 owing to the drought of that year, butthe flocks in 
1906 were of better quality than at any previous period and little 
short of the number of 1898. The vast majority of the sheep are 
of the merino breed, but there are about a million long-woolled sheep 
and between two and three million cross-bred. Dairying made very 
great strides in the ten years preceding 1906, and ranks as one of 
the great industries of the state. There were 644,000 dairy cows in 
1906, and the numbers are increasing year by year. The production 
of wool was 300,000,000 lb, as in the grease; tallow, 493,000 cwt.; 
butter, 500,000 cwt.; cheese, 42,000 cwt.; and bacon and hams, 
110,000 cwt. 

Mining. — The mining industry has made great strides. In 1905 
there were about 38,000 men engaged in the various mines, besides 
3300 employed in smelting. Of these, 10,700 were employed in gold- 
mining; in coal-mining there were 14,100; silver, 7100; tin, 2750, 
and copper, 1850. The value of mining machinery may be approxi- 
mately set down at £2,900,000. The following summary shows 
the value of the various minerals won in 1905. It is impossible to 
separate the values of silver and lead contained in the ore obtained 
at Broken Hill; the two metals are therefore shown together.

The value of gold won varies from year to year, but from 1894 to 
1906 in only two years did it fall below £1,000,000. About one- 
fourth of the gold won is alluvial. The yield of gold from quartz 
mines was in 1904 11 dwt. 14 grs. per ton, which was somewhat 
below the average for the previous ten years. The Broken Hill 
silver lode is the largest as yet discovered; it varies in width from 
10 ft. to 200 ft., and may be traced for several miles. The Broken 
Hill Proprietary Company owns the principal mine, and at Port 
Pirie in the neighbouring colony of South Australia erected a com- 
plete smelting plant; the problem of the recovery of the zinc con- 
tents of the ore having been satisfactorily solved, the company 
made extensive additions to the plant already erected, and in 1906 
the manufacture of spelter was undertaken. From the commence- 
ment of mining operations on a large scale in 1885 to the end of 1905 
the value of silver and lead ore won was £40,000,000. The pro- 
duction of tin rapidly declined after 1881, when the value of ore 
raised was £569,000: the production varies both with the price 
and the occurrence of rain, out the principal cause of the decreased 
production was the exhaustion of the shallow deposits of stream tin, 
from which most of the ore was obtained. The principal deposits of 
copper are in the central parts between the Maequane, Bogan and 
Darling rivers. The copper lodes ot New South Wales contain ores 
of a much higher grade than those of many well-known mines 
worked at a profit in other parts of the world, and, with a fair price 
for copper, the production largely increases. Iron is widely diffused, 
principally in the form of magnetite, brown haematite, limonite 
and bog iron. Coal mining is carried on in three districts. In the 
northern or Hunter river district there were 63 collieries, employing 
10,500 men, and the quantity of coal raised was in 1904 about 
4,100,000 tons; in the southern district there were fifteen collieries, 
employing 3100 men and raising 1 ,600,000 tons of coal. The western 
or mountain collieries were seventeen in number, employing 540 men 
and raising about 418,000 tons. About 52% of the coal obtained 
is exported. Kerosene shale (torbanite) is abundant and is system- 
atically worked.. 

Manufacturing. — There are a large and rapidly increasing number 
of manufactories, but in 1905 only about 250 employed more than 
jo hands. The following gives a statement of factory employment 
or eleven years : —

About 5-3% of the males and io-6% of the females employed 
are under sixteen years; the total number of male employees in 1905 
was 56,117, and of females, 16,058. About two-thirds of the hands 
are employed in Sydney and the adjacent district. The total value 
of the articles produced in manufactories, and the increased value 
of materials after undergoing treatment, was £30,028,000 in 1905, 
of which £17,500,000 represented value of materials used and 
£600,000 the value of fuel : the total wages paid was £5,200,000. 

Commerce. — During 1905, 2725 vessels entered New South Wales 
ports from places outside the state; their tonnage was 4,697,500; 
the value of goods imported was £29,424,008; and the value of 
exports was £36,757,002. The average value of imports per in- 
habitant was £20 and of exports £24, 17s, The bulk of the trade is 
carried on with the other Australian states; in 1905 the value of 
such trade was, imports, £14,938,885, and exports, £12,263,472 ; 
the British trade is also considerable, the imports direct from Great 
Britain being valued at £8,602,288 andthe exports £10,222,422. 
With all British countries the trade was, imports, £25,989,399, and 
exports, £25,994,563. New South Wales maintains a large trade 
with foreign countries aggregating £3,434,609 imports and 
£10,762,439 exports. France^ Germany, ^Belgium and the United 
States are the principal foreign countries with which the state 
trades. 

Wool is the staple export, and represents, in most years, one-third 
the valueof the exports. Gold coin and bullion form one of the 
principal items in the export list, but only a small portion of the 
export is of local production, the balance being Queensland and 
New Zealand gold sent to Sydney for coinage. The course of trade 
from 1880 to 1905 was as follows: — 

	+-------+-------------+-------------+
	| Year. |   Imports.  |   Exports.  |
	+-------+-------------+-------------+
	| 1880  | £14,176,063 | £15,682,802 |
	| 1885  |  23.737.461 |  16,750,107 |
	| 1890  |  22,615,004 |  22,045,937 |
	| 1895  |  15,992,415 |  21,934.785 |
	| 1900  |  27.561,071 |  28,164,516 |
	| 1905  |  29,424,008 |  36,757,002 |
	+-------+-------------+-------------+

The principal articles of export in 1905 were: Wool, £13,446,260; 
gold, £3,053,331; silver and concentrates, £2,407,142; lead, 
£1,072,858; butter, £817,820; coal, £1,565,602; copper, £1,280,599; 
breadstuffs, £i,345.5 8 9; leather and skins, £1,559,033; meats, 
£761,235; tallow, £464,330; timber, £353.265; tin, £466,049. 

Banking. — The banks of issue number thirteen; their paid-up 
capital amounts to £13,918,000 and the capital and reserves to 
£19,319,000, but of this sum only about £9,000,000 is used in the 
state. On the 30th of June 1906 the com and # bullion in reserve 
amounted to £8,192,000 and the note circulation to £1,462,000. 
The banks had on deposit £23,325,730 bearing interest and 
£15,773,883 not bearing interest, representing a total of £39,100,000. 
The savings banks had on their books at the close of 1905 about 
355,714 depositors, with £13,500,000 to their credit. This repre- 
sents £9, is. 6d. per inhabitant. The total deposits in all banks 
therefore amounted to £52,600,000. The progress from i860 to 
1905 was as follows; — 

	+-------+------------+-------------+
	| Year. | Amount on  | Average per |
	|       | Deposit.   | Inhabitant. |
	|       |            |  £. s. d.   |
	+-------+------------+-------------+
	| 1860  | £5.721,208 |  16 8 3     |
	| 1870  |  7,044,464 |  14 2 6     |
	| 1880  | 19,958,880 |  26 13 8    |
	| 1890  | 43,390,141 |  38 13 6    |
	| 1900  | 43,135,000 |  31 17      |
	| 1905  | 52,600,000 |  34 17 6    |

Postal and Telegraph Service. — The postal business of 1905 was 
represented by the carriage of 102,292,888 letters and postcards, 
44.599. f 04 newspapers and 23,077,094 parcels and books; the 
telegrams despatched numbered 3,837,962. To transact the postal 
business of the country, mail conveyances travelled 12,000,000 m. 
The income of the postal and telegraph department in 1905 was 
£1,065,618 and the expenditure £933,121, but there were some 
items of expenditure not included in the sum named, such as interest 
charges, &c, and cost of new buildings. The administration of the 
post office is under the commonwealth government 

Railways. — The railways are almost entirely in the hands of the 
state, for out of 3471 m. open in 1906 the state owned 3390 m. 
The capital expended on the state lines open for traffic was 
£43,626,000, of which sum £7,400,000 was expended on rolling 
stock and equipment and £36,226,000 on construction of^ roads, 
stations and permanent ways. The net earnings amounted in 1906 
to £1,926,407, which represents a return of 4*41 % upon the capital 
invested. The state pays, on an average, 3-69% for the money 
borrowed to construct the lines, and there is therefore a considerable 
surplus to the advantage of the revenue. The year 1906 was, how- 
ever, a very excellent one as regards railway working, the operations 
of the ten previous years showing an average loss of about a quarter 
of 1 %. (T. A. C.) 

History 

New South Wales was discovered by Captain Cook on board 
the " Endeavour," on 20th April 1770. After he had observed 
the transit of Venus at Tahiti, he circumnavigated 
New Zealand and went in search of the eastern coast history* 
of the great continent whose western shores had long 
been known to the Dutch. He sighted the Australian coast at 
Gippsland, Victoria, near Cape Everard, which he named Point 
Hicks, and sailed along the east coast of Australia as far north 
as Botany Bay, where he landed, and claimed possession of the 
continent on behalf of King George III. He then continued his 
voyage along the east coast of Australia, and returned to England 
by way of Torres Strait and the Indian Ocean. The favourable 
reports made by Captain Cook of the country around Botany 
Bay induced the British government to found a penal settlement 
on the south-eastern part of what was then known as New 
Holland. An expedition, consisting of H.M.S. " Sirius" of 20 
guns, the armed trader " Supply," three store-ships and six 
transports, left England on 17th May 1787, and after touching at 
Tenerife, Rio de Janeiro, and the Cape of Good Hope, arrived at 
Botany Bay on the 20th of January 1788, under the command of 
Captain Arthur Phillip, R.N., with Captain John Hunter, R.N,, 
as second. The persons on board the fleet included 564 male 
and 195 female convicts, and a detachment of marines, consisting 
of Major Ross, commandant, 16 officers, 24 non-commissioned 
officers, an adjutant and quartermaster, 160 privates and 40 
women. There were in addition five medical men and a few 
mechanics. The five stock consisted of one bull and four cows, 
a stallion and three mares, some sheep, goats, pigs and a large 
number of fowls. The expedition was well provided with seeds 
of all descriptions. 

The shores of Botany Bay were found to be unsuitable for 
residence or cultivation, and Captain Phillip transferred the 
people under his command to Port Jackson, half a 
*settiemcnt ^ ozen n^les away, near the site of the present city of 
regime, Sydney. For some years the history of the infant 
settlement was that of a large gaol; the attempts 
made to till the soil at Farm Cove near Sydney and near Parra- 
matta were only partially successful, and upon several occasions 
the residents of the encampment suffered much privation. But 
by degrees the difficulties inseparable from the foundation of a 
remote colony were surmounted, several additional convict- 
ships landed their living freight on the shores of Port Jackson, 
and in 1793 an emigrant-ship arrived with free settlers, who 
were furnished with provisions and presented with free grants 
of land. By the end of the 1 8th century the inhabitants of Sydney 
and its neighbourhood numbered 5000. Immediately after the 
arrival of the first fleet, surveys of the adjacent coast were made; 
the existence of a strait between Australia and Tasmania was 
discovered by Surgeon Bass; and before the retirement of 
Governor King in 1806 Australia had been circumnavigated 
and the principal features of its coast-line accurately surveyed 
by Captain Flinders, R.N. The explorations landward were, 
however, not so successful, and for many years the Blue Moun- 
tains, which rise a few miles back from Sydney, formed an im- 
penetrable barrier to the progress of colonization. Penal 
establishments were formed at Newcastle in New South Wales, 
at Hobart and Launceston in Tasmania, and an unsuccessful 
attempt was made to colonize Port Phillip. The most note- 
worthy incident in the first decade of the 19th century was the 
forcible deportation by the officers of. the New South Wales 
Corps, a regiment raised in England for service in the colony, of 
the governor, Captain Bligh, R.N., the naval officer identified 
with the mutiny of the " Bounty." For some time the govern- 
ment was administered by the senior officer of the New South 
Wales Corps, but in 1809 he was succeeded by Captain 
Macquarie, who retained the governorship for eleven years. 

During the regime of this able administrator New South Wales 
was transformed from a penal settlement to a colony. Before 
Captain t ^ ie arr i va l °f Macquarie schools and churches had 
Mao been erected, a newspaper, the Sydney Gazette and 
quarie's New South Wales Advertiser, had been started, and 
^hi^ a0r ' att empts had been made to acclimatize the drama. 

But he was the first governor to open up the country. 
He constructed permanent buildings at Sydney and Parramatta, 
formed roads and built bridges in the districts along the coast, 
and commenced a track across the Blue Mountains, which had 
been crossed in 1813 by Wentworth and others, thus opening 
up the rich interior to the inhabitants of Sydney. It was during 
Captain Macquarie's administration that the first banking in- 
stitution, the Bank of New South Wales, was founded. The 
final fall of Napoleon in 181 5 gave the people of the United 
Kingdom leisure to think about their possessions at the Anti- 
podes; and in 181 7 free settlers commenced to arrive in con- 
siderable numbers, attracted by the success of Captain John 
M 'Arthur, an officer in the New South Wales Regiment, who 
had demonstrated that the soil, grass and climate were well 
adapted for the growth of merino wool. But although the 
free settlers prospered, and were enabled to purchase land on 
very easy terms, they were dissatisfied with the administration 
of justice, which was in the hands of a judge-advocate assisted 
by military officers, and with the absence of a free press and 
representative institutions. They also demanded permission 
to occupy the vast plains of the interior, without having to 
obtain by purchase or by grant the fee-simple of the lands upon 
which their sheep and cattle grazed. These demands were 
urged during the governorships of Sir Thomas Brisbane and 
General Darling; but they were not finally conceded, together 
with perfect religious equality, until the regime of Sir Richard 
Bourke, which lasted from 1831 to 1837. At the 
latter date the population had increased to 76,793, I8SL 
of whom 25,254 males and 2557 females were or had 
been convicts. Settlement had progressed at a rapid rate. 
Parramatta, Richmond and Windsor had indeed been founded 
within the first decade of the colony's existence; Newcastle, 
Maitland and Morpeth, near the coast to the north of Sydney, 
had been begun during the earlier years of the 19th century; 
but the towns of the interior, Goulburn, Bathurst and others, 
were not commenced till about 1835, in which year the site of 
Melbourne was first occupied by Batman and Fawkner. The 
explorations which followed the passage of the Blue Mountains 
opened up a large portion of south-eastern Australia. Van 
Diemen's Land was declared a separate colony in 1825, West 
Australia in 1829, South Australia in 1836 and New Zealand 
in 1839; so that before 1840 the original area of New South 
Wales, which at first included the mainland of Australia and 
the islands in the South Pacific, had been greatly reduced. In 
1840 the press was free in every part of Australia, trial by jury 
had been introduced, and every colony possessed a legislature, 
although in none of them except New South Wales had the 
principle of representation been introduced, and in that colony 
only to a very limited extent. The policy of granting land 
without payment, originally in force in New South Wales, had 
been abandoned in favour of sales of the public lands by auction 
at the upset price of twenty shillings per acre; and the system 
of squatting licences, under which colonists were allowed to 
occupy the waste lands on payment of a small annual licence, 
had been conceded. In 1851, when separate autonomy was 
granted to Victoria, New South Wales had a population of 
187,243, the annual imports were £2,078,338, the exports 
£2,399,580, the revenue was £575,794* and the colony contained 
13 2 )43 7 horses, 1,738,965 cattle and 13,059,324 sheep. 

Gold was discovered at Summerhill Creek, near Bathurst, 
in February 1851, by Edward Hammond Hargraves; and at 
the end of June the first shipment, valued at £3500, left Sydney. 
This discovery made an important change in the position of the 
colony, and transportation, which had been discontinued during 
the previous year, was finally abolished. The first mail steamer 
arrived in August 1852, and in 1853 a branch of the Royal 
Mint was established at Sydney. The New Constitution Bill, 
passed during the same year by the local legislature, provided 
for two deliberative chambers, the assembly to be elected and 
the council nominated, and for the responsibility of the execu- 
tive to the legislature. The Sydney University, founded in 
1850, was enlarged in 1854, and the first railway in R CS pons* 
New South Wales, from Sydney to Parramatta, com- /we 
menced in 1850, was opened in 1855. In the same govern* 
year the Imperial parliament passed the New Con- ^£'* 
stitution Act; and in June 1856 the first responsible 
government in Australia was formed, during the governor- 
ship of Sir William Denison, by Mr Stuart Alexander Donaldson. 

The first administration lasted only for a few weeks, and 
it was some years before constitutional government worked 
smoothly. The powers of the new parliament were utilized 
for extending representative institutions. Vote by ballot was 
introduced; the number of members in the assembly was 
increased to 80, and the franchise was granted to every adult 
male after six months' residence in any electoral area. Mean- 
while the material progress of the colony was unchecked. A 
census taken at the end of 1857 showed that tbe population 
of Sydney was, including the suburbs, 81,327. Telegraphic 
communication was established between Sydney, Melbourne, 
Adelaide and Tasmania in 1859; and during the same year 
the Moreton Bay district was separated from New South Wales 
and was constituted the colony of Queensland. 

During the regime of Sir John Young, afterwards Lord Lisgar, 
who succeeded Sir William Denison in 1861, several important 
sir Jo ha events occurred. The land policy of previous govern- 
Youag*s ments was entirely revised, and the Land Bill, framed 
governor- by Sir John Robertson, introduced the principle of 
ship. deferred payments for the purchase of crown lands, 

and made residence and cultivation, rather than a sufficient 
price, the object to be sought by the crown in alienating the 
public estate. This measure, passed with great difficulty and 
by bringing considerable pressure to bear upon the nominated 
council, was the outcome of a lengthened agitation throughout 
the Australian colonies, and was followed by similar legislation 
in all of them. It was during the governorship of Sir John 
Young that the distinction between the descendants of convicts 
and the descendants of free settlers, hitherto maintained with 
great strictness, was finally abandoned. In 1862 the agitation 
against the Chinese assumed importance, and the attitude of 
the miners at Lambing Flat was so threatening that a large 
force, military and police, was despatched to that goldfield in 
order to protect the Chinamen from ill-treatment by the miners. 
At this time, the only drawback to the general progress and 
prosperity of the country was the recrudescence of bushranging, 
or robbery under arms, in the country districts. This crime, 
originally confined to runaway convicts, was now committed 
by young men born in the colony, familiar with its mountains 
and forests, who were good horsemen and excellent shots. It 
was not until a large number of lives had been sacrificed, and 
many bushrangers brought to the scaffold, that the offence was 
thoroughly stamped out in New South Wales, only to reappear 
some years afterwards in Victoria under somewhat similar 
conditions. 

The earl of Belmore became governor in 1868, and it was 
during his first year of office that H.R.H. the duke of Edinburgh 
visited the colony in command of the " Galatea." An attempt 
made upon his life, during a picnic at Clontarf, caused great 
excitement throughout Australia, and his assailant, a man named 
OTarrell, was hanged. A measure which virtually made 
primary education free, compulsory and unsectarian came into 
operation. A census taken in 187 1 showed that tbe population 
was 503,981; the revenue, £2,908,155; the expenditure, 
£3,006,576; the imports, £9,609,508; and the exports, 
£11,245,032. Sir Hercules Robinson, afterwards Lord Rosmead, 
was sworn in as governor in 1872. During his rule, which lasted 
till 1879, the Fiji Islands were annexed; telegraphic communica- 
tion with England and mail communication with the United 
States were established; and the long series of political struggles, 
which prevented any administration from remaining in office 
long enough to develop its policy, was brought to an end by a 
coalition between Sir Henry Parkes and Sir John Robertson. 
Lord Augustus Loftus became governor in 1879, in time to 
inaugurate the first International Exhibition ever held in 
Australia. The census taken during the following year gave the 
population of the colony as 751,468, of whom 4*1,149 were 
males and 340,319 females. The railway to Melbourne was com- 
pleted in 1880; and in 1883 valuable deposits of silver were 
discovered at Broken Hill. In 1885 the Hon. W. B. Dalley, who 
was acting Premier during the absence through ill-health of 
Sir Alexander Stuart, made to tbe British government the offer 
of a contingent of the armed forces of New South Wales to aid the 
Imperial troops in tbe Sudan. Tbe offer was accepted; the 
contingent left Sydney in March 1885, on board the 
" Iberia " and " Australasian," and for the first time ^JjJ Qt 
a British colony sent its armed forces outside its own %8S° Zea 
boundaries to fight on behalf of the mother-country. 
In July of the same year Dr Moran, the Roman Catholic arch- 
bishop of Sydney, became the first Australasian cardinal. Lord 
Carrington, who was appointed governor in 1888, opened the 
railway to Queensland, and during the same year the centenary 
of the colony was celebrated. The agitation against the Chinese, 
always more or less existent, became intense, and the govern- 
ment forcibly prevented the Chinese passengers of four ships 
from landing, and passed laws which practically prohibit the 
immigration of Chinese. 

In 1889 the premier, Sir Henry Parkes, gave in his adhesion to 
the movement for Australasian federation, and New South Wales 
was represented at the first conference held at Melbourne in the 
beginning of 1890. Lord Jersey assumed office on the 15th of 
January 1891, and- a few weeks afterwards the conference to 
consider the question of federating the Australian colonies was 
held at Sydney, and the great strike, which at one time had 
threatened to paralyse the trade of the colony, came to an end. 
A board of arbitration and conciliation to hear and determine 
labour questions and disputes was formed, and by later legisla- 
tion its .powers have been strengthened. (For the labour 
legislation of the state, see Australia.) A census taken on the 
5th of April 1891 showed that the population was 1,134,207, 
of whom the aborigines numbered 7705 and the Chinese 12,781. 
In 1893 a financial crisis resulted in the suspension of ten banks; 
but with two exceptions they were reconstructed, and by the 
following year the effects of the degression had passed away. 
Federation was not so popular in New South Wales as in the 
neighbouring colonies, and no progress was made between 1891 
and 1894, although Sir Henry Parkes, who was at that time 
in opposition, brought the question before the legislature. The 
Rt. Hon. Sir William Duff, who followed Lord Jersey as governor, 
died at Sydney in 1895, and was succeeded by Lord Hampden. In 
1896 a conference of Australian premiers was held at Sydney to 
consider the question of federation. The then Premier, Mr Reid, 
was rather lukewarm, as he considered that the free-trade policy 
of New South Wales would be overridden by its 
protectionist neighbours and its metropolitan position f^^ s 
interfered with. But his hand was to a great extent federation. 
forced by a People's Federation Convention held at 
Bathurst, and in tbe early portion of 1897 delegates from New 
South Wales met those from all the other colonies, except 
Queensland, at Adelaide, and drafted the constitution, which 
with some few modifications eventually became law. The 
visit of the Australian premiers to England on the occasion of 
Queen Victoria's Diamond Jubilee gave an additional impetus 
to federation, and in September 1897 the convention reassembled 
in Sydney and discussed the modifications in the constitution 
which had been suggested in the local parliaments. In January 
1898 tbe bill was finally agreed to and submitted to a popular 
referendum of the inhabitants of each colony. Those of Victoria, 
South Australia and Tasmania agreed to the measVire; but 
the majority in New South Wales, 5458, was not sufficient to 
carry the biU. The local parliament subsequently suggested 
certain amendments, one of them being tbat Sydney should be 
the federal capital. The general election returned a majority 
pledged to federation, and after some opposition to the federal 
Bill by the legislative council it was again referred to the 
electors of the colony and agreed to by them, 107,420 votes being 
recorded in its favour, and 82,741 against it. One of the provisions 
of the bill as finally carried was that the federal metropolis, 
although in New South Wales, should be more than 100 m. from 
Sydney. The Enabling Bill passed through all its stages in the 
British parliament during the summer of 1900, all the Australian 
colonies assenting to its provisions; and on the 1st of January 
1901 Lord Hopetoun, the governor-general of Australia, and the 
federal ministry, of whicb tbe premier, Mr Barton, and Sir 
William Lyne, Home Secretary, represented New South Wales, 
were sworn in at Sydney amidst great rejoicings. Large con- 
tingents of troops from New South Wales were sent to South 
Africa during 1899 and 1000. (G. C. L.) 


NEWSPAPERS. The word "newspaper," as now employed, 
covers so wide a field that it is difficult, if not impossible, to give 
it a precise definition. By the English " Newspaper Libel and 
Registration Act " of 188 1 it is defined as " any paper containing 
public news, intelligence or occurrences, or any remarks or 
observations therein printed for sale, and published periodically 
or in parts or numbers at intervals not exceeding twenty-six 
days "; and the British Post Office defines a newspaper as " any 
publication " — to summarize the wording — " printed and pub- 
lished in numbers at intervals of not more than seven days, 
consisting wholly or in part o£ political or other news, or of 
articles relating thereto or to other current topics, with or without 
advertisements." In ordinary practice, the " newspapers," 
as distinguished from other periodicals (q.v.), mean the daily 
or (at most) weekly publications which are principally concerned 
with reporting and commenting upon general current events. 

For the laws regulating the conduct and contents of newspapers 
see Press Laws and allied articles. The two real essentials of 
a " newspaper " are that it contains " news," and is issued at 
regular intervals. But the course of history has involved 
considerable changes both in the mode of issue and in the con- 
ception of what " news " is. For purposes of modern usage we 
have to distinguish historically between the product of a printing- 
press which is manifolded by that means, and a mere manuscript 
sheet which is only capable of being copied by hand. " News" 
again varies both according to the appetite and according to its 
method of collection and presentation. A distinction ought 
perhaps to be made between literary and pictorial news, but this 
is almost impossible in practice. 

1. General Considerations 

So far as very early forms of what we now recognize as corre- 
sponding to a " newspaper " are concerned, involving public 
reports of news, the Roman Ada Diurna and the Chinese Peking 
Gazette may be mentioned here, if only on account of their 
historical interest. The Acta Diurna (" Daily Events ") in 
ancient Rome (lasting to the fall of the Western Empire), were 
short announcements containing official intelligence of battles, 
elections, games, fires, religious rites, &c, and were compiled by 
the actuarii officers appointed for the purpose; they were kept 
as public records, and were also posted up in the forum or other 
places in Rome, and were sometimes copied for despatch to the 
provinces. Juvenal speaks of a Roman lady passing her morning 
in reading the paper, so that it appears that private copies were 
in vogue. In China the Peking Gazette, as foreigners call it, 
containing imperial rescripts and official news, has appeared 
regularly ever since the days of the Tang dynasty (a.d. 618-905). 
Even older than it, as is alleged, is the monthly Peking News 
(Tsing-Pao) — now in appearance an octavo book of 24 pages in 
a yellow cover — which, according to M. Huart, French Consul 
at Canton, was founded early in the 6th century. But it is not 
of any real moment to do more than refer to such publications 
as these, which have little in common with the ideas of Western 
civilization. The " newspaper " in its modern acceptation can 
only be properly dated from the time when in Western Europe 
the invention of printing made a multiplication of copies a 
commercial possibility in any satisfactory sense. 

On the point of terminology, Mr J. B. W. Williams, in his 
History of English Journalism to the Foundation of the Gazette 
(1008), the first scholarly account of the early evolution of the 
Press in England, describes the Oxford Gazette of 1665 (the 
original of the London Gazette) as the first English " newspaper " 
in the precise sense, i.e. a "paper "of news; 1 for it was a half- 
sheet in folio, two pages, and not a " pamphlet " as previous 
periodicals of news had been. A pamphlet (q.v.) was one or more

	a letter in 1670 to Charles Perrot, second editor of the Gazette: " I 
	wanted your newes paper Monday last past." 

unbound sheets of paper folded in quarto, and these earlier 
periodicals were called " news books" The term " news sheet" 
again, had implied, up to that time, a written letter of news — a 
" newsletter*" as it came afterwards to be called. But it is 
hardly necessary to insist here' on the distinction between a 
" news book " and a " newspaper," interesting as it is to note 
that the English inclusion of newspapers among " books " for 
the purpose of the law of copyright is strictly justified by the 
original nomenclature. The " newsbook " made what is for 
modern purposes the essential advance upon either the written 
" newsletter " or the isolated printed announcement of some 
event, in being both printed and also issued in a series at regular 
and continuous intervals. Yet both these forms of publication 
were in the direct ancestry of the newspaper. The writing of 
" letters of news " or " letters of intelligence " was a regular 
profession before the printed newspaper was introduced, and 
lasted as such for some time afterwards, having indeed the 
advantage of being outside the necessity of obtaining a licence, 
which hampered the printed publication; and the profession of 
" scrivener " naturally suggested that of the later type of 
journalist. Of what used, again, to be called a " relation," i.e. 
a statement of an isolated piece of news, there are various printed 
examples as early as during the latter part of the 15th century. 
For instance, an official manifesto of Archbishop Dietrich of 
Cologne was printed at Mainz in 1462. A French pamphlet 
giving an account of the surrender of Granada to Ferdinand 
and Isabella — " le premier jour de Janvier dernierement pass6 " — 
appeared in 1492. 

Precisely at what point, and in what instance, it can be said 
that a continuous series of news-pamphlets started, which can 
therefore be called the earliest newspaper, is hard to decide, 
upon the materials now available. But it was on the continent 
of Europe, and not in England; and probably in the Nether- 
lands. We have, for instance, pamphlets in the British Museum, 
which contain news-items and suggest periodical publication, 
though they are not actually known to form copies of a regular 
series. A Newe Zeytung; Die Schlact des turkischen Keysers, 
&c. } dates from 1526; another Newe Zeytung, still more varied in 
its contents, contains a letter from Winchester dated July 24, 
1554. In Germany alone about 800 examples of such news- 
pamphlets dating earlier than 1610 are known. The effect of 
the Cologne Mercurius Gallobelgicus (1594) on English purveyors 
of " relations " is dealt with below (under United Kingdom); 
but this was rather a book than a newspaper. The earliest plainly 
periodical publication containing " news of the day " was, how- 
ever, the German Frankfurter Journal, a weekly started by 
Egenolph Emmel in 1615. The Antwerp Nieuwe Tijdinghen 
followed in 1616; and in 1622 the history of English newspapers 
begins with the Weekly Newes published in London by Archer and 
Bourne. From this point we are on firmer ground, and the 
evolution of the modern Press in the different countries, as traced 
below, can be continuously followed. It is worth noting that 
a link in the history of journalism with the Roman Ada Diurna 
is provided by the Venetian government written gazelti (from 
which comes our " gazette ") of the 16th century, official bulletins 
or leaflets dealing with public affairs, which were avowedly based 
on the ancient Roman model. Italy indeed originated not only 
the title " gazette " (probably derived from the Gr. 7<xfa, i.e. 
treasury of news), but also that of " coranto " (Fr. couranl; also 
early anglicized as " current," i.e. a " running " relation), both of 
which are familiar in the history of the English and foreign Press. 

The art and business of journalism, as now understood — 
taking " journalism " here in the sense of the production of the 
literary contents of a newspaper, and not the production 
and distribution of the printed sheet itself — is a ismm 
combination of the mere recording or reporting of news 
and of its presentation in such a way, and with such comment, 
as to influence the minds of readers in some particular direction. 
The history of the " leading article " as a great factor in the 
shaping of public opinion begins with Swift, Defoe, Bolingbroke 
and Pulteney, in the many English newspapers, from the Review 
and the Examiner to the Craftsman, by which was waged the 
keen political strife of the years 1 704-1 740. There is no counter- 
part to it in France until the Revolution of 1789, nor in Germany 
until 1796 or 1798. It was a Frenchman who wrote — " Suffer 
yourself to be blamed, imprisoned, condemned; suffer yourself 
even to be hanged; but publish your opinions. It is not a right; 
it is a duty." It was in England that the course so pithily 
described was actually taken, in the face of fine, imprisonment 
and pillory, at a time when in France the public had to depend 
upon foreign journals illicitly circulated, when its own chief 
writers resorted to clandestine presses, to paltry disguises, and 
to very poor subterfuges to escape the responsibilities of avowed 
authorship, and when in Germany there was no political publicity 
worthy to be named. When the Mercure de France (1672), 
after a long period of mediocrity, came into the hands of men of 
large intellectual faculty, they had the most cogent reasons for 
exerting their powers upon topics of literature rather than upon 
themes of politics. True political journalism dates in France 
only from the French Revolution (see, for instance, Mallet du 
Pan), and it then had a very brief existence. It occupied a 
cluster of writers, some of whom left an enduring mark upon 
French literature. A term of high aspiration was followed 
quickly by a much longer term of frantic licence and of literary 
infamy. Then came the long rule of a despotic censorship; and 
cycles of licence followed by cycles of repression. In 1870 indeed 
the democratic government at Bordeaux issued against journals 
of high aims and of unspotted integrity, but opposed to its 
pretensions, edicts as arbitrary as the worst acts in that kind of 
Napoleon I., and unparalleled in the whole course of the govern- 
ment of Napoleon III. 

In all the other countries of Europe political journalism, in 
any characteristic sense, was the creation of the 19th century — 
somewhat earlier in the century in northern Europe, somewhat 
later in southern. The Ordinarie Post-Tidende of Stockholm 
dates indeed from 1643, but until recent times it was a mere 
news-letter. Denmark had no sort of journal worth remark 
until the foundation in 1 749 of the Berlingske Tidende, and that 
too attained to no political rank. The Gazette (Viedomosti) of 
St Petersburg — the patriarch of Russian newspapers — dating 
from the 16th of December 1702, is a government organ, and 
nearly synchronizes with the Boston News-Letter (1704), the first 
successful attempt at a newspaper in the British colonies in 
America. Journalism in Italy begins with the Diario di Roma 
in 1 716, but in politics the Italian press remained a nullity for 
all practical purposes until nearly the middle of the 19th century, 
when the newspapers of Sardinia, at the impulse of Cavour, 
began to foreshadow the approach of the influential Italian 
press of a later day. In Spain no rudiments of a newspaper press 
can be found until the 18th century; the Gaceta de Madrid 
started about 1726. As late as in 1826 an inquisitive American 
traveller recorded his inability to lay his hands, during his 
Peninsular tour, upon more than two Spanish newspapers. 

While originally the newspaper depended entirely on its own 
reporters and correspondents for news, and still largely does so, 
the widening of the field of modern journalism is largely due to 
collective enterprise, by which outside organizations "known as 
" news agencies " send a common service of news to all papers 
which arrange to take it. The first of the great collecting and 
distributing news agencies, Reuter's Agency, was founded by 
Julius Reuter, a Prussian government-messenger, who was 
impressed by the common interest roused by the revolutionary 
movements of 1848. In 1849 he established a news-transmitting 
agency in Paris, with all the appliances that were then available. 
Between Brussels and Aix-la-Chapelle he formed a pigeon- 
service, connecting it with Paris and with Berlin by telegraph. 
As the wires extended, he quickly followed them with agency- 
offices in many parts of the continent. He then went to London, 
where his progress was for a moment held in check. Mr Walter 
of The Times listened very courteously to his proposals, but 
(on that first occasion) ended their interview by saying, " We 
generally find that we can do our own business better than 
anybody else can." He went to the office 01 the Morning 
Advertiser, which had then the next largest circulation to that 

	xix. 18 

of The Times, and had better success. He entered into an agree- 
ment with that and afterwards with other London journals, 
including The Times, and also with many commercial corporations 
and firms. The newspapers, of course, continued to employ 
their own organizations and to extend them, but they found 
great advantage in the use of Reuter's telegrams as supple- 
mentary. Within a few years the business is said to have yielded 
the founder some £25,000 a year, and in 1865 it was transferred 
to a limited company. In later* years this type of news-agency 
operating all over the world was repeated by others, and also 
by agencies operating mainly or exclusively only in one country. 

It is no longer possible nowadays to confine the meaning of 
" journalism " merely to the work of those who write for the 
Press. Properly it may be said to include the whole intellectual 
work comprised in the production of a newspaper; and although 
the designation of " journalist " is generally applied only to 
editors and to writers, and would not be extended at all to the 
purely mechanical staff — the compositors, foundry-men and 
machinists — nor even to the proof-readers, whose sphere is 
analogous rather to the sub-editorial than to the mechanical 
departments, the modern tendency has nevertheless been, not 
only to install mere reporting (q.v.) in a place of high importance, 
but to give increased weight in journalism to those who occupy 
what may be called the " managerial " offices, the business side 
of making a paper pay having itself developed into an art on 
its own account. To be a great " journalist " was once, but is 
hardly now, the same as being a great " publicist." The publicist 
proper is he who delivers his views on public affairs in the Press; 
but the excellence of his articles may nevertheless be consistent 
with the journal being a disastrous failure, and his reputation 
as a journalist is then but poor. The great journalist is he who 
makes the paper with which he is connected a success; and in 
days of competition the elements necessary for obtaining and 
keeping a hold on the public are so diverse, and the factors bear- 
ing on the financial success, the business side, of the paper are 
so many, that the organization of victory frequently depends 
on other considerations than those of its intrinsic literary 
excellence or sagacity of opinion, even if it cannot be wholly 
independent of these. The modern newspaper, moreover, depends 
for its financial success no longer primarily on its receipts from 
circulation, but on its receipts from advertisements; and though 
these can only ultimately be secured on the basis of circulation 
(the number of people who buy and read the paper), the establish- 
ment of the paper as the organ of a large body of readers for 
whose custom it is desirable to advertise often involves other 
capacities than those of the great publicist; and even in so far 
as the circulation depends on the attractiveness of its " news," 
the direction given to the supply of news may be managerial 
rather than editorial. Thus, in the division of labour, the editorial 
functions, formerly supreme and all-embracing, because the 
excellence of the contents of the paper made its success, have 
gradually, by a fissiparous process, yielded some of their authority 
to the managerial functions, and these have grown into an in- 
dependence which — since editorial possibilities ultimately depend 
on financial resources — has given increased importance in 
journalism to the business side. 

It must suffice here to say therefore that the work of journalism 
may be broadly divided into its editorial and managerial sides. 
And apart from exceptional cases of a working proprietor who 
is both editor and manager, or of a managing-editor, or of a great 
manager who exercises editorial functions, or a great editor 
who exercises managerial functions, the ordinary course is to 
keep them fairly distinct. The managerial side involves the 
business work of a paper, including the obtaining of advertise- 
ments and all the operations directly connected with producing 
it and making it pay as a commercial enterprise. The editorial 
side is engaged — however much managerial exigencies may 
dictate its policy — in providing the " reading matter " which 
forms its contents, other than such as is of the nature of advertis- 
ing. The editorial staff includes 'editors and assistant-editors, 
sub-editors (in Great Britain a term usually restricted in daily 
journalism to those engaged in the " news " departments), 
leader-writers, critics, reporters (more narrowly considered part 
of the " sub-editorial " staff), &c. The actual owner of the paper, 
the proprietor, may or may not take part in either side, but in 
law his authority is delegated to those who produce it. The older 
ideas of journalistic management survive in making the editor, 
publisher and printer, but curiously not the "manager/* liable 
in a writ for libel, contempt of court, &c, together with the 
proprietor in English law. But no satisfactory legal definition 
of " editor," still less of " manager," is possible, since their 
positions and powers vary according to circumstances. 

So far as the general relations of the staff of a paper with its pro- 
prietor are concerned, we may briefly note that engagements are 
contracts for personal service ; they will not therefore be specifically 
enforced, and the remedy for injury is dismissal or action for damages ; 
and they must be in writing and stamped, to be evidencein law, if 
for a year or longer. The editor is the agent of the proprietor, and 
binds him for acts within the scope of editorial authority (which 
includes the insertion of any matter in the paper). Being an agent 
he can have no power as against the proprietor, but unreasonable 
interference on the latter's part may entitle an editor to an action 
for breach of contract or for damage to his professional reputation: 
while gross misconduct on the part of an editor might similarly 
entitle the proprietor to damages. Letters, manuscripts, &c, come 
into the editor's hands as agent for his proprietor, and are the 
jatter's property. Uninvited contributors send him articles at their 
own risk, but the sending to them of a type-set proof has been held 
to be evidence of acceptance. Apart from special terms, the editor 
is entitled to " edit " such articles, i.e. use them wholly or in part, 
or alter them ; he has a free hand to do so in the case of anonymous 
articles ; in the case of signed articles it is clearly his duty to keep 
them free from libel or illegality, but the right to edit is limited 
in so far as his alterations might attribute to the writer anything 
which would give the latter a claim for damages. Though the highest 
function of an editor is embodied in the etymology of the word (a 
11 bringer forth " or producer), as one who acts as the literary 
midwife in the literary setting forth of ideas, it is probably his use of 
the proverbial blue-pencil, altering or deleting, which is generally 
associated with the word "to edit. Each aspect, however, of edi- 
torial work has its own importance — the organization and inspiration 
on the one hand, the moulding into shape on the other. And " good " 
editing is necessarily relative, depending to a certain extent on the 
character of the paper which it is intended to produce.

Fisher and Strachan, Law of the Press (2nd ed., 1898). 

The history of the Newspaper Press is told for various countries 
of importance under their respective sections below. The 
practical development of the modern newspaper is indeed due 
to a union of causes, largely mechanical, that may well be termed 
marvellous. A machine (see Printing) that, from a web of 
paper 3 or 4 m. long, can. in one hour, print, fold, cut and deliver 
many thousand perfected broadsheets, is, however, not so great 
a marvel as is the organizing skill which collects information 
by conversation, post or telegraph, from all over the world, 
and then distributes these communications in cheap printed 
copies regularly every day to an enormous public, sifted, arranged 
and commented upon, in the course of a few hours. But for a 
high ideal of public responsibility and duty, conjoined with high 
culture and with great " staying-power," in the editorial rooms, 
all these marvels of ingenuity — which now combine to develop 
public opinion on great public interests, and to guide it — would 
be nothing better than a vast mechanism for making money out 
of man's natural aptitude to spend his time either in telling or 
in hearing some new thing. A newspaper, after all, is essentially 
a business, conducted by its proprietors for gain. That the 
commercial motive is a danger to honest journals is obvious, 
were it not indeed that here as elsewhere honesty is in the long 
run the best commercial policy. 

The example of American journalism has so greatly affected 
the developments in England and other countries since about 
1890, that it is important to realize the conditions 
under which, in the United States, the newer type 
of journalism arose. 1 In substance very much the 
same causes produced very much the same effects, 
though at a slower rate, in England;, but British 
conservatism operated here as elsewhere. Several circumstances 
combined in the last quarter of the 19th century to promote

	Reid's article in the 10th edition oi the Ency. Brit. 

	The Influence of American Journalism* 

great changes in the condition and character of American 
newspapers. (1) Paper was enormously cheapened. Before and 
during the Civil War it cost large New York newspapers at 
times 22 cents per lb for even a poor quality. In 1864 it cost 
16 cents in February, and ran up a cent every month till in mid- 
summer it touched 21 and 22 cents. As late as 1873 it was still 
sold at from 12 to 13 cents. As new materials were found and 
machinery was improved, the price slowly declined. When the 
manufacture from wood-pulp was made commercially successful, 
the profits tempted great investments of new capital; bigger 
mills were built, competition became keen, and new inventions 
cheapened the various processes. Thus in New York in 1875 
the average price for the year for fair" news'* paper was 8-53 
cents per lb; in 1880, 6-92; in 1885, 5-16; and in 1890, ^3^ 
At last, about 1897, large contracts for a good average quality, 
delivered at the press-room, were made in New York at as low 
a figure as 1*5 cents per lb. Subsequently advances in raw 
materials, one or two dry seasons which curtailed the water- 
power, and combinations resulting from over-competition, caused 
some reaction. Yet it could still be said in 1900 that prudent 
publishers could buy for $1 as much paper as would have cost 
them $3 twenty years earlier, or $10 about 1875. (2) Printing 
machinery fcr great newspaper offices was transformed. Instead 
of the old cylinder presses fed by hand, with the product then 
folded and counted by hand, machines came into common use 
to print, fold, cut, paste and count and deliver in bundles, 
ready either for the carrier or the mail, at rates of speed formerly 
not dreamed of. The size of the paper could be increased or 
diminished at will, as late news might require, within an hour 
of the time when it must be in the hands of its readers. Instead 
of cutting down other news to make room for something late and 
important, more pages were added, and this steadily increased 
the tendency to larger papers. Devices were also found for 
printing the same sheet in different colours at the sarhe rate of 
speed; and in this way startling headlines were made more 
startling in red ink, or a piece of news for which special attention 
was desired was made so glaring that no one could help seeing 
it. (3) Hand-setting (for great newspapers) was practically 
abolished. Instead of the slow gathering of single types by 
hand separate lines were now produced and cast by machines, 
capable when pushed to their utmost capacity of doing each 
the work of five average compositors. Thus between 1880 and 
1900 there were reductions in the cost — (1) of the raw material 
for the manufacture of newspapers from two-thirds to three- 
fourths; (2) of printing, at least as much; and (3) of com- 
position, at least one-half, while the facilities in each department 
for a greater product within a given time were enormously 
increased. The obvious business tendency of these changes was 
either a reduction in price or an increase of size, or both. 

Electricity became the only news-carrier. New ocean cables 
broke down the high rates charged at the outset. The American 
news appetite, growing by what it fed on, soon demanded far 
fuller cablegrams of European news; and the wars in which 
Great Britain and the United States were involved accelerated 
the movement. The establishment of a strong telegraph com- 
pany, capable of efficient competition with the one which 
practically controlled the inland service in 1880, likewise 
cheapened domestic news by telegraph and increased its volume. 
The companies presently recognized their interest in encouraging 
rival news associations, and so getting double work for the 
wires, while promoting the establishment of new papers. Wild 
competition between news agencies was thus encouraged (even 
in the cases of some already known to be bankrupt) to the 
extent of credits of a quarter or half a million dollars on tele- 
graphic tolls. The rapid spread of long-distance telephone lines 
further contributed to this tendency to make the whole continent 
a whispering gallery for the press. Every great paper had both 
telegraph and telephone wires run directly into its newsroom. 

Photography and etching were added to the office equipment. 
Various " process " methods were found, by which the popular 
desire for a picture to make the news clearer could be gratified. 
Drawings were reproduced successfully in stereotype plates for 
the fastest rotary presses. The field of political caricature had 
heretofore belonged exclusively to the weekly papers, but the 
great dailies now seized upon it, and commanded the service of 
the cleverest caricaturists. Newspapers found a way to put the 
" half-tone " etching of a photograph, such as had heretofore 
been printed only on slow flat presses, bodily into the stereotype 
plate for the great quadruple and octuple presses; and there- 
after portraits and photographs of important groups on notable 
occasions began to appear, embodied in the text describing the 
occurrences, a few hours after the camera had been turned on 
them, in papers printed at the rate of thirty and forty thousand 
an hour. In this development of illustrated daily journalism 
America rapidly went far beyond other countries. 

News agencies multiplied and gave cheaper service. The 
New York Associated Press had been the chief agency for the 
whole country. It admitted new customers with great caution, 
and its refusal to admit was almost prohibitory, while its with- 
drawal of news from established papers was practically fatal. 
It was owned by the leading New York journals. Their dis- 
agreements led to the success of a rival, the United Press. The 
New York Associated Press finally dissolved, most of the New 
York members became connected with the United Press, and 
many of their Western and Southern clients organized the 
Associated Press of Illinois, more nearly on a mutual plan. The 
United Press finally failed, and most of its New York members 
went into the Associated Press of Illinois, which in turn was 
forced into plans for reorganization by decisions of Illinois 
courts .against its rules for confining its services to its own 
members. One result of these successive changes was to en- 
courage new papers by making it easy for them to secure a 
comprehensive news service, and thus to threaten the value of 
the old papers. Another was the struggle to increase the volume 
of the service, leading to reports of multitudes of occurrences 
formerly left without notice in the great news centres, and ex- 
tension of agencies into the remotest hamlets, and less scrupulous 
care in the consideration and preparation of the reports filed at 
many points for transmission. News syndicates for special 
purposes also developed, as well as small news associations, 
sometimes with a service sufficient for the wants of many 
papers. The almost official authenticity which the public 
formerly attributed to an Associated Press despatch measurably 
declined; and the dailies found more difficulty in sifting and 
deciding upon the news that came to them, and incurred more 
individual responsibility for what they printed. 

The great accumulation of private fortunes also changed the 
newspapers. Millionaires came to think it advantageous to 
own newspapers, openly or secretly, which could be conducted 
without reference to direct profits, for the sake primarily of 
political, social or business considerations. To secure large 
circulations for such enterprises they were willing to sell the 
paper for long periods at much below the cost of manufacture, 
and to spend money for news and writers more lavishly than 
the legitimate business of established journals would allow. 
Great business corporations seeking for favourable or fearing 
adverse legislation sometimes made secret newspaper investments 
for the same purpose. 

These various new conditions, affecting the newspaper press 
of the United States with ever-increasing force, gradually 
changed the average character of the papers and their effect 
upon their readers. A large circulation became the only evidence 
of success and the only way to make the sale of a newspaper 
below cost ultimately a source of profit. A disposition to lower 
the character in order to catch the largest audience naturally 
followed. Criminal news was reported more fully than formerly, 
with more piquant details. Competitors outdid each other in 
the effort to treat all news with unprecedented sensationalism. 
The lowest possible price was regarded as essential to the largest 
possible circulation, and so a favourite price even for large 
newspapers became one cent to the public, and consequently 
only half a cent to the publishers, whose business was practically 
all at wholesale with dealers and news companies. The feeling 
that the most must be given for the money prompted also the 
great increase in size, only made possible by the reductions in 
paper, composition, presswork, &c, already noted. Yet mere 
quantity and mere sensation after a time palled on the jaded 
appetite, and the spice of intense personality became necessary. 
As most people like to see their names in print, and can bear 
criticism of their neighbours with composure, these two chords 
of human nature were incessantly played upon. 

The principal feature in the development of modern news- 
papers is the importance attached to obtaining, and prominently 
displaying, " news " of all sorts, and incidentally chanc 
there has been a considerable change of view as to what uristics 
sort of news should be given prominence. Sport and of modern 
finance are treated at greater length and more popu- news ~ 
larly; and, partly owing to the largely increased 
number of papers and consequent greater competition, partly 
to a desire to appeal to the larger public, which is now able to 
read and ready to buy reading-matter, there has been a tendency 
to follow the tastes of the vast number of people who can read 
at all rather than of those to whom reading means a very 
high standard of literary and intellectual enjoyment. This has 
involved a more popular form of presenting news, not only, in 
a less literary style and by the presentation of " tit-bits " of 
information with an appeal to cruder sentiments, but also in a 
more liberal use of headlines and of similar devices for catching 
the eye of the reader. " Personal journalism," i.e. paragraphs 
about the private life or personal appearance of individuals — 
either men or women — of note or notoriety in society or public 
affairs, has become far more marked; and in this respect, as 
in many others, encouragement has been given to a spirit of 
inquisitiveness, and also to a widespread inclination either to 
flatter or be oneself flattered, the latter desire being indeed con- 
spicuously prevalent in these "democratic days" even among 
the classes which once affected to despise such publicity. 

The modern impulse, culminating in England in the last 
decade of the 19th century in what was then called the "New 
Journalism," was a direct product of American conditions and 
ways of life, hut in Great Britain it was also the result of the 
democratic movement produced by the Education Act of 1870 
and the Reform Act of 1885; and it affected more or less all 
countries which came within the influence of free institutions. 
The most generally adopted American innovation (for, though 
not known before even in England, it was practically a new 
thing as carried out in American newspapers) was the " inter- 
view " (the report in dialogue form of a conversation with some 
prominent person, whose views were thus elicited by a reporter), 
which during the early 'nineties was taken up in varying degrees 
by English newspapers; it was "cheap copy" — the word 
" copy " covering in journalistic slang any matter in the shape 
of an article — and could easily be made both informing and 
interesting; and " interviewing " caused a large increase in the 
journalistic profession, notably among women. The rage for the 
" interview " again declined in vogue outside American journalism 
in proportion as people of importance became less ready to talk 
for publication — or for nothing. 

From the highest class of paper downwards, however, real 
news — and especially early news — has been more and more 
sought after, and all the force of organization both within 
individual newspaper offices and outside them in the shape of 
news agencies, has been applied to the purpose of obtaining 
early news and publishing it as quickly as possible. In this 
matter the Press has certainly been helped most materially 
not only by the advance in telegraphic facilities (see Reporting) 
but by all the other new rapid methods of production in Type- 
setting (see Typography) and Press-work (see Printing) which 
have been the feature of the modern period. The vastly increased 
amount of telegraphic work now done has perhaps not been all 
pure gain to the best sort of journalism. It has to some extent 
weakened the effect of the considered article, and led to hasty 
conclusions and precipitate publication, with results that 
sometimes cannot be compensated for by any later contradiction 
or modification. In some cases a reaction ensued. Take for 
instance the case of war correspondence. The prestige of the 
" war correspondent " became at one time enormous, and his 
evolution from the days of H. Crabb Robinson, who wrote to 
The Times from Spain in 1807-1809, has been traced by busy 
pens with all the precision of a special interest in history. 
Certainly nothing finer in active English journalism was ever 
done than in W. H. Russell's letters to The Times from the 
Crimea, or the work of Archibald Forbes and others in the Franco- 
Prussian War; but more recently, although first-rate abilities 
have been forthcoming, the news agencies, often favoured by the 
military Press censor, have generally been ahead of the " specials," 
and the individual work that might have been done for isolated 
papers has been much hampered by restrictions. This is due 
partly to the increased competition, partly to military jealousy 
and officialism, partly to the vital importance of secrecy in 
modern warfare: but the result has been to a considerable 
extent to reduce the value of the " war correspondent " as 
compared with what was done in the Press in the days of Russell 
and Forbes. A letter arriving weeks after the telegraphic 
account, however meagre, is largely shorn of its interest. Given 
a brilliant foreign correspondent, the form of letters sent home 
from abroad on general subjects is still, no doubt, very effective. 
But the telegram is necessarily the backbone of the news service 
of the daily paper. The Press, be it added, is frequently able to 
acquaint the public with what is going on while a government 
itself is still uninformed. The work of officials and statesmen 
is admittedly increased and sometimes embarrassed by the 
new strain imposed upon them in consequence, but the public 
are on the whole well served by their emancipation from the 
obscurity of purely official intelligence and by the obligation 
of straightforward dealing imposed upon governments, which 
in their nature are apt to be secretive. 

Connected with the increased attention given to news is the 
greater vogue of the newspaper " poster " or contents-bill, 
which is exhibited in the streets. The poster has acquired 
commercial importance for indicating the possession of some 
special news without revealing its whole nature, and the tendency 
has been to have fewer lines and fewer words in larger type, in 
order to catch the eye more impressively. Rotary machines for 
printing these posters enable them to be turned out with greater 
rapidity; and in the case especially of evening papers it is 
possible at any time during the afternoon, should important news 
arrive, to issue a new poster and thus secure a large street sale 
by the insertion of a few words only in the " stop press " or 
" fudge " without the necessity of changes in the plates. The 
catch-penny style of the poster has transferred itself also to the 
newspaper itself, in the shape of the " scare " headlines. And 
there has been a tendency for the news to be so " displayed " 
in the headlines as to make any further reading unnecessary. 

Apart from the publication of " news " and reports, and 
occasional original articles of a descriptive and miscellaneous 
character, the chief function of a newspaper is criticism, whether 
of politics or other topics of the moment, or of the drama, art, 
music, books, sport or finance. As regards sport, the comments 
of the various newspapers are mainly descriptive ; but a prominent 
feature in the United Kingdom has been the attention paid to 
" tipping " probable winners on the Turf, and the insertion of 
betting news. The publication of the " odds " some time before 
a race, and of starting-prices, undoubtedly helped to foster the 
increase of this form of gambling, as was pointed out in the 
report of the Select Committee on Gambling in England in 1902, 
but the efforts to induce the English newspapers to keep such 
matter out of their columns have not had much success. The 
Daily News (London) in 1902 started on a new proprietorship 
under Mr Cadbury with a declared policy of not referring to horse- 
racing or betting; but when its principal proprietors in 1909 
became largely concerned also in the Star and Morning Leader, 
they were apparently content to retain the " tipster " elements 
which bulked large in them, and this inconsistency aroused 
considerable comment. The sporting interest (i.e. the desire 
to know results of racing and cricket, &c.) largely inflates the 
circulation of most of the London and provincial halfpenny 
evening papers. 

Between about 1870 and 188c the English newspapers began to 
pay increased attention to literary and artistic criticism; and 
gradually the daily Press, which formerly applied itself mainly 
to recording news, and to political, social and financial subjects, 
became a formidable rival in this sphere to the weekly reviews 
and the monthly and quarterly magazines. Books are "re- 
viewed " in the Press partly for literary reasons, partly as a 
quid pro quo for publishers' advertisements; and the desire for 
" something to quote," irrespectively of the responsible nature 
of the criticism, became in the early 'nineties a mania with 
publishers, who in general appear to have considered that their 
sales depended upon their catching a public which would be 
satisfied by seeing in the advertisement that such and such a book 
was pronounced by such and such a paper to be " indispensable 
to any gentleman's library." Unfortunately the enormous 
output of books made it impossible for editors to have them all 
reviewed, and equally impossible for them to be certain of 
discriminating properly between those which were really worth 
reviewing or not. The result has been that the work of book- 
reviewing in the newspapers is often hastily and poorly or very 
spasmodically done. But there have been some honourable 
exceptions. The "Literary Supplement" (since 1901) to 
The Times is the most ambitious attempt made by any daily 
paper to deal seriously with literature. The Daily Chronicle 
started a " literary page " in 1891, and it was imitated in varying 
degrees by other English papers. The Scotsman and some other 
provincial papers have also for some time devoted much space 
to excellent literary criticism. The " literary supplement " 
has also been developed to excellent effect in some journals 
in the United States, such as the New York Times, where this 
feature was indeed originally started. As a form of serious 
criticism, however, the review has, in the general newspapers of 
later years, taken a lower place than must be desirable, partly 
owing to the cause named, partly to a tendency among reviewers 
either to indiscriminate praise or to irresponsible irrelevance, 
partly to a suspicion of " log-rolling "; and to a large extent 
it has become the practice merely to treat the appearance of 
new books as so much news, to be chronicled, with or without 
extracts, according as the subject makes good " copy," like any 
other event of the day. 

The modern tendency, resulting from the enormous amount 
of newspaper production, has been to make journalism less 
literary and at the same time literature more journalistic. 
Either as reviewers, leader-writers or editors, many of the 
principal " men of letters " have worked for longer or shorter 
periods as writers for some newspaper or other, and much of 
the published literature of the time has appeared originally in 
the columns of the newspapers, in the form of essays, poems, 
short stories or novels (in serial form). Publication in this 
shape has many advantages for an author besides that of ad- 
ditional remuneration; it offers an opportunity for a new writer 
to try his wings, and it helps to introduce him at once to a large 
public. Moreover, the newspapers read by the educated classes 
profit by the superior class of journalist represented by writers 
of a literary turn. But the increased popularity of the news- 
paper, and the close tie between it and the literary world, have 
on the whole impressed a journalistic stamp upon much of the 
literature of the day. However popular at the moment a writer 
may be, the infection with journalistic methods — while rightly 
employed by journalists, as such, in dealing with contemporary 
events and for strictly contemporary purposes — is apt to he 
responsible for something wanting in his work, the loss of which 
deprives him of the permanent literary or scientific rank to 
which he might otherwise aspire. 

The new point of departure for the more popular style of 
English journalism (apart from the influence of American 
models) is really to be found in the publication of Sir George 
(then Mr) Newnes's Tit-Bits in 1881. This penny weekly 
paper, with its appeal to the masses, who liked to read snippets 
of information brightly put together, showed what enormous 
profits were to be made by this style of enterprise; and the 
multiplication of journals of this description — notably Mr 
Alfred Harmsworth's (Lord Northcliffe's) Answers (1888) and 
Mr C. Arthur Pearson's Pearson's Weekly (1890) — had a further 
influence on public taste, so that even the classes above that 
which primarily enjoyed these publications were affected in 
the same direction. A new note was thus introduced into 
English daily journalism in England. Whereas before 1885 
the chief feature in London journalism, outside The Times and 
other great morning papers, had been the b'terary brilliance 
of the Saturday Review and its evening paper analogues, the 
Pall Mall and St James's Gazettes, in the early 'nineties came 
a craze for " actuality." Mr T. P. O'Connor, with his vivid 
pen (first in the Star, then in the Sunday Sun and elsewhere), 
set the pace for a crowd of imitators; the successful establish- 
ment of the Daily Mail in 1896, with its system of compressing 
the news of the day briefly and pointedly into short paragraphs, 
while at the same time catering for all tastes and employing 
first-rate correspondents and reporters to supply it with special 
information, gave a distinct shake-up to the older traditions 
of daily journalism. The old tendency had been to rely for 
success either on writers of exceptional knowledge or capacity, 
men who were essentially amateurs, or on a class of professional 
journalists who at all events had a literary tradition behind them. 
A different sort of amateur now arose, and a different sort of 
professional. Even when an attempt was made to provide for 
a literary public, success came to be generally sought by popular 
rather than by b'terary methods. The literary public in the 
proper sense of the word is inevitably a small one, and the greater 
part of the Press deals with literature on lines more suited to 
a larger and less refined clientele. It may be claimed, no doubt, 
that the best sort of journalism shows a high, and sometimes 
the highest, literary standard, but the fact remains that for the 
bulk of modern journalism its conductors realize only too well 
that their business is to appeal to the masses, and to a standard 
of education and taste which falls far short of anything that can 
be called intellectual. 

It is often said that the leading articles or " editorials," 
expressing the attitude of the paper towards important subjects 
of the day, have lost their importance, but this is only a half- 
truth. Allowance being made for changes in literary style, 
the actual amount of good writing in this department in the 
great organs of opinion — well-informed, scholarly and incisive — 
may justly be considered equal to anything done in what are 
sometimes considered its palmy days. 1 On the other hand, 
it is undoubtedly the case that in the newer type of newspaper, 
which appeals rather on the score of its tit-bits of news and 
rapid readableness to a more casual and less serious public, the 
whole raison d'itre of the old-fashioned leading article has 
disappeared, and its place is taken by a few brief notes, merely 
indicating the attitude of the paper, and not seeking to discuss 
any subject comprehensively at all. The " leader " is to some 
extent a form of newspaper routine, but on the whole it is a 
routine which has proved its value by experience. The con- 
tinuous high standard of tone, maintained by so many great 
journals, depends more largely than is sometimes realized on 
the regular industry and skill of those whose business it is to 
discuss the latest developments of affairs every day or every week 
in a manner which gives reasonable men something fresh to think 
about, or interprets for them the thoughts which are only 
vaguely floating in their minds. The liberty of the Press enables 
every sort of view, right or wrong, to be discussed in this 
prominent form, and thus every aspect of a question is brought 
out in public, to be accepted or rejected according to the weight 
of evidence and of argument. 

The same end is assisted by the devotion of so much space 
to " letters to the editor." It is sometimes said that in England 
the London Times owes its position largely to the fact that if 
any individual grievance is felt it is generally ventilated by a 
letter to The Times. Whatever may be the organization of the 

	1 It must be remembered that the style of public speeches has also 
	altered. Nobody thinks of quoting the classics nowadays in the 
	House of Commons. A more business-like form of speech is adopted 
	in public life, and the Press reflects this change. 

Press for reporting the news of the day, the resources of no 
newspaper staff are great enough to cover an area of information 
as large as that represented by its readers; and the value of 
the outlet for opinion and information afforded by the corre- 
spondence columns cannot be overstated. 

Most people probably read more papers than is compatible 
with a healthy mental digestion, but the Press, as. such, has 
to-day an enormous — and none the less real because subtle — 
influence; and this is largely due to the reputation maintained 
by its higher representatives. While, individually, the great 
papers wield considerable influence, due partly to real sagacity 
and authority, partly to the psychological effect produce^ by 
mere print or by reiterated statement, collectively the Press 
now represents the Public, and expresses popular opinion more 
directly than any representative assembly. The multiplication 
of " Press-cutting agencies," and of such essentially " newsy " 
pubh'cations as Who's Who (the English form of which originated 
with Mr Douglas Sladen in 1897) and similar biographical 
reference books — all tending to increase the pubticity of modern 
life — has contributed materially to the pervading influence of 
journalism in everyday life and the constant dependence of 
society in most of its manifestations on the activity of the 
" Fourth Estate." (H. Ch.) 

From the introduction of low rates for telegraphy and from 
the increase of mechanical methods of production, and of the 
desire to read and the growth of advertising (see 
Advertisement), the modern low-priced newspaper £^?' 
has resulted. But it is by no means a recent develop- papers. 
ment merely. In France, Theophrastus Renaudot's 
Gazette de Paris (1631) was started at the price of six centimes. 
In England we find the first mention of inexpensive news-sheets 
towards the close of the 17th century, when a number of half- 
penny and farthing Posts sprang into existence, and appeared 
at more or less irregular intervals. These consisted of small 
leaflets, containing a few items of news — sometimes accompanied 
by advertisements — and were commonly sold in the streets by 
hawkers. The rise in cost was really due to artificial causes. 
The increase of these newspapers, and especially the growing 
practice of inserting advertisements, led the legislature to con- 
template a stamp tax of a penny per sheet on all news publica- 
tions. As a protest, a curious pamphlet — of which a copy is 
preserved in the British Museum — was issued in 1701, and it 
sheds an interesting light upon this early phase of cheap journal- 
ism. The pamphlet is entitled Reasons humbly offered to the 
Parliament on behalf of several persons concerned in the paper- 
making, printing and publishing of the halfpenny newspapers. 
It states that five master printers were engaged in the trade, 
which used 20,000 reams of paper per annum. The journals 
are described in the following terms: " The said newspapers 
have been always a whole sheet and a half, and sold for one 
halfpenny to the poorer sort of people, who are purchasers of 
it by reason of its cheapness, to divert themselves, and also to 
allure herewith their young children and entice them to reading; 
and should a duty of three halfpence be laid on these mean news- 
papers (which, by reason of the coarseness of the paper, the 
generality of gentlemen are above conversing with), it would 
utterly extinguish and suppress the same." The pamphlet goes 
on to say that hundreds of families, including a considerable 
number of blind people, were supported by selling the half- 
penny journals in the streets. 

In 17 1 2 a tax of a halfpenny per sheet was imposed, and the 
cheap newspapers at once ceased to exist. This tax on the press 
was increased from time to time, till in 181 5 it stood at fourpence 
per sheet. The usual price of newspapers was then sevenpence 
a copy. From these facts it seems highly probable that, had not 
the stamp tax been imposed, the halfpenny paper would soon 
have become the normal type, and would have continued so to 
this day. In 1724 a committee of the House of Commons sat 
to consider the action of certain printers who were evading the 
stamp tax by publishing cheap newspapers under the guise of 
pamphlets. They found that there were then two Halfpenny 
Posts published in London, one by Read of Whitefriars. and the 
other by Parker of Salisbury Street. There were also three 
weekly papers issued at a halfpenny a copy. The tax, after 
several reductions, was finally repealed on 15th June 1855, and 
a rush of cheap papers immediately followed. A penny became 
the usual price for London daily papers, with the exception of 
The Times, and halfpenny papers soon became common. 

The growth of the cheap newspaper has since been practically 
a simultaneous one throughout the civilized world. This has 
been notably the case in the United States, France and Great 
Britain. The general tendency in newspaper production, as in 
all other branches of industry, has in recent times been towards 
the lowering of prices while maintaining excellence of quality, 
experience having proved the advantage of large sales with a 
small margin of profit over a limited circulation with a higher rate 
of profit. The development — and indeed the possibility — of 
the cheap daily paper was due to a number of causes operating 
together during the latter half of the 19th century. Among 
these, the first place must undoubtedly be given to the cheapening 
of paper, through the introduction of wood pulp and the perfect- 
ing of the machinery used in the manufacture. From 1875 to 
1885 paper cheapened rapidly, and it has been estimated that 
the introduction of wood pulp trebled the circulation of news- 
papers in England. Keen competition in the paper trade also 
did much to lower prices. At the same time the prime cost of 
newspaper production was increased by the introduction of 
improved machinery into the printing office. The growth of 
advertisements must also be taken into account in considering 
the evolution of the halfpenny journal. The income from this 
source alone made it possible to embark upon journalistic enter- 
prises which would otherwise have been simply to court disaster. 
The popular' journal of the present day does not, however, 
owe its existence and success merely to questions of diminished 
cost and improved methods of production. A change has come 
over the public mind. The modern reader likes his news in a 
brief, handy form, so that he can see at a glance the main facts 
without the task of reading through wordy articles. This is 
especially the case with the man of business, who desires to master 
the news of the past twenty-four hours as he travels to his office 
in the morning. It is to economize time rather than money 
that the modern reader would often prefer a halfpenny paper; 
while the man of leisure, who likes to peruse leading articles 
and full descriptive accounts, finds what he needs in the more 
highly priced journals. The halfpenny paper in England has not 
had to contend with the opposition that the penny newspaper 
met from its threepenny contemporaries in the 'fifties and 'sixties. 
This is largely due to the fact that in most cases the contributors, 
paper, printing and general arrangement of the cheaper journal 
do not leave much room for criticism. Mr G. A. Sala once com- 
plained that the reporters of the older papers objected to work 
side by side with him when he represented the first penny London 
daily (the Daily Telegraph), through fear of losing caste, but 
this does not now apply, for in the United Kingdom, France and 
the United States the cheap journals, owing to their vast circula- 
tion, are able to offer the best rates of remuneration, and can 
thus command the services of some of the best men in all the 
various departments of journalism. (N.) 

Another aspect of the newspaper which may here be considered 
is the introduction of pictorial illustrations (see also Illustra- 
tion). The earliest attempts at popular illustration 
papers, °f new s events took the form in England of " broad- 
sides." One broadside dated 1587 recounted the 
Valiant Exploits of Sir Francis Drake; another dated 1607 
gave an account of A wonderful flood in Somersetshire and 
Norfolk. The series of murder broadsides which lasted almost 
to our own time commenced in 1613 with one that gave an account 
of the murder of Mr William Storre, a clergyman of Market 
Rasen, in Lincolnshire, by Francis Cartwright. Early in the 
reign of Charles I. there appeared a broadside which described 
a fall of meteors in Berkshire. A little later— in 1683— the 
Weekly News came out with the picture of an island which was 
supposed to have risen from the sea on the French coast. The 
execution of Strafford in 1641 was made the subject of a picture 
pamphlet that is to be seen in the British Museum, and in 1642 
the first attempt to portray the House of Commons appeared 
in A Perfect Diurnall of the Passages in Parliament. In 1643 
a pamphlet was published, called The Bloody Prince; or a 
Declaration of the Most Cruel Practices of Prince Rupert and the 
rest of the Cavaliers infighting against God and the True Ministers 
of His Church. This contains a woodcut representation of 
Prince Rupert on his charger, one of the first attempts at pro- 
viding the public with a portrait of a contemporary celebrity. 

Soon after this there appeared a journal, entitled Mercurius 
Civicus, which frequently gave illustrations, and, allowing for 
the Weekly News with its one attempt at an illustration above 
mentioned, must be counted the first illustrated paper. Mer- 
curius Civicus, however, only gave portraits; it published 
Charles I. and his queen, Prince Rupert, Sir Thomas Fairfax 
and all the leading men on both sides in the Civil War. Perhaps 
the most interesting illustration of the next four years was that 
contained in a tract intended to evoke sympathy for the con- 
quered and captured king. It represented Charles in Carisbrooke 
Castle in 1648. There were many later attempts to depict the 
tragedy of Charles L's execution, and several woodcuts present 
to us also the execution of the regicides after Charles II. came to 
the throne. A broadside of the reign of the second Charles 
shows the Frost Fair on the Thames in 1683, and with a broad- 
side describing Great Britain *s Lamentations, or the Funeral 
Obsequies of that most incomparable Protestant Princess — Queen 
Mary, the wife of William III., in 1695 — we close the illustrated 
journalism of the 17th century. 

Curiously enough, the 18th. century, so rich in journalistic 
enterprise and initiative so far as the printed page was concerned, 
did less than the previous century to illustrate news. In 1731, 
however, in the Grub Street Journal, there appeared the first 
illustration of the Lord Mayor's procession. In 1740 another 
journal, the Daily Post, gave an illustration of Admiral Vernon's 
attack on Porto Bello. The narrative was introduced by the 
edito'r with the information that the letter that he is printing 
is from a friend who witnessed the conflict between the English 
and the Spaniards. The writer of the letter, who must be put 
on record as the father of war correspondents, signed himself 
" William Richardson." 

There were some interesting efforts to illustrate magazines 
about this time. In the Gentleman's Magazine for 1746 there 
was a lengthy account of the famous rising of 1745* and a map 
was given of the country round Carlisle, showing the route of 
the Scottish rebels; and in the same volume there was a portrait 
of the duke of Cumberland, In 1747 the Gentlemanys gave a 
bird's-eye view of the city of Genoa, illustrating the account of 
the insurrection there, and so on year by year there were further 
pictures. In 1751 an obituary notice was illustrated by a 
portrait of a certain Edward Bright of Maldon, Essex. Mr 
Bright died at the age of thirty, and his interest to the public 
was that he weighed 42^ stones. There were a number of maga- 
zines besides the Gentleman's that came out about this time and 
continued well into the next century. In the Thespian Magazine 
for 1793, for example, there is an illustration of a new theatre 
at Birmingham. Then there were the English Magazine, the 
Macaroni Magazine, the Monstrous Magazine. Every one of 
these contained illustrations on copper, more or less topical. 

William Clement, the proprietor of the Observer, the first 
number of which was published in 1791, was the first real 
pioneer of illustrated journalism, although his ideals fell short 
in this particular, that he was never prepared to face the illustra- 
tion of news systematically; he only attempted to illustrate 
events when there was a great crisis in public affairs. In 1818 
Abraham Thornton, who was tried for murder, appealed to the 
wager of battle, which after long arguments before judges was 
proved to be still in accordance with statute law, and he escaped 
hanging in consequence. Thornton's portrait appeared in the 
Observer. Clement owned for some time Bell's Life and the 
Morning Chronicle. All his journals contained occasional 
topical illustrations. The Observer's illustration of the house 
where the Cato Street conspirators met is really sufficiently 
elaborate for a journal of to-day, and in 1820 it gave its readers 
" A Faithful Reproduction of the Interior of the House of Lords 
as prepared for the Trial of Her Most Gracious Majesty Queen 
Caroline." In 1821 it published an interior of the House of 
Commons with the members in their places. The Observer 
of 22nd July 1821 — the Coronation number — contained four 
engravings. Of the George IV. Coronation number Mr Clement 
sold 60,000 copies, but even that was nothing to the popularity 
that this journal secured by its illustrations of the once famous 
murder of Mr Weare and the trial of the murderer Thurtell. 
The Observer in 1838 gave a picture of the Coronation of Queen 
Victoria. In 1841 there was a fire at the Tower of London, 
when the armoury was destroyed. The Observer published 
three illustrations of the fire; it further published an emblematic 
engraving on the birth of the prince of Wales, and issued a large 
page engraving of the christening ceremony in the following 
January. Thus it had in it all the elements of pictorial journalism 
as we know it to-day. 

The weekly Illustrated London News was, however, the first 
illustrated newspaper by virtue of its regularity. It was the 
first illustrated paper, because all the illustrations to which we 
have referred as appearing in the Observer and other publications 
were irregular. They came at intervals; they were quite sub- 
ordinate to the letterpress of the paper; they were given only 
occasionally in times of excitement, with a view to promoting 
some little extra sale. That they did not really achieve the 
result hoped for to any great extent may be gauged by the fact 
that from 1842 to 1847 the Observer published scarcely any 
illustrations at all, and in the meantime the Illustrated London 
News had taken an assured place as a journal devoted mainly 
to the illustration of news week by week. That is why its first 
publication marked an epoch in journalism. The casual illustra- 
tion of other journals still went on: the Weekly Chronicle, for 
example, still published a number of pictures; the Sunday 
Times, also a very old paper, illustrated in these early days 
many topical subjects. In 1834, indeed, it pictured the ruins 
of the House of Commons, when that building was burned down. 
A paper started in 1837 called the Magnet gave illustrations, 
one of them of the removal from St Helena and delivery of the 
remains of the emperor Napoleon to the prince de Joinville 
in 1840. 

The first number of the Illustrated London News appeared on 
14th May 1842. Its founder was Herbert Ingram (1811-1860), 
who was born in Boston, Lincolnshire, and started life amid 
the most humble surroundings, what education he ever received 
having been secured at the free school of his native town. 
Apprenticed at fourteen to a printer in Hull, he later settled in 
Nottingham as a printer and newsagent in a small way. It 
was during his career as a newsvendor at Nottingham that he 
was seized with the belief that it was possible to produce a paper 
entirely devoted to illustration of news. In the first number of 
the Illustrated London News, however, there was not a single 
picture that was drawn from actual sight, the factor which is 
the most essential element of the illustrated journalism of to-day. 
Sir John Gilbert (181 7-1897), the artist, has stated that not one 
of the events depicted by him — a state ball at which the queen 
and the prince consort appeared, the queen with the young 
prince of Wales in her arms, and other incidental illustrations — 
was taken from life. 

The Illustrated London News had not been long in existence 
before there were many imitators, in America Harper's Weekly, 
in France V Illustration and in Germany Ober Land und Meer, 
and from that day there has been constant development, the 
Illustrated Zeitung of Leipzig being perhaps the most striking. 
In America the use of illustrations in the daily papers has become 
a regular feature, culminating in the bulky Sunday editions of 
the principal journals; and the practice of presenting the news 
in pictorial form has increased continuously even in England. 
In 1010 three London daily newspapers were principally devoted 
to illustration— the Daily Graphic, the Daily Mirror and the 
Daily Sketch, while most of the penny and halfpenny journals 
included some form of pictorial matter. This change was due 
to the ever-increasing cheapening and ever-growing celerity of 
manufacture of what are known as half-tone blocks. It was in 
i3oo that the application of photography to illustrated journalism 
began in England, and by 1910 it had grown to enormous 
dimensions, but the first newspaper photographs (mainly 
portraits) had to be engraved on wood, although the use of half- 
tone came in well-nigh simultaneously. Up to 1890 illustrated 
journalism was in the hands of the artists, and the artists were 
in the hands of the wood engravers, who reproduced their work 
sometimes effectively — often inefficiently. But in the course of 
twenty years the wood engraver had been utterly superseded so far 
as illustrated journalism was concerned. The further develop- 
ments of journalism seemed likely to be entirely in the direction of 
coloured reproductions, block-making and machinery for facili- 
tating their production having made particularly rapid strides.

It is almost impossible by any statistical detail to give an idea of 
the advances made by the newspaper press as a whole; n 
but an outline of the general results for 1828, 1866 and J£™£JL 
1882, together with a fourth, as given in the 10th edition tistics 
of this encyclopaedia for 1900, may have its utility. 

The earliest summary is that of Adrien Balbi. It was published in 
the Revue encyclopidique for 1828 (vol. i. pp. 593"603)» along with 
much matter of more than merely statistical interest. The numbers 
of newspapers published in different countries at that date are given 
as follows: France, 490; United Kingdom, 483; Austria, about 80; 
Prussia, 288; rest of the Germanic Confederation, 305; Nether- 
lands, 150; Spain, 16; Portugal and the Azores, 17; Denmark, 
Sweden and Norway, 161; Russia and Poland, 84. The respective 
proportions of journals to populations were — for Prussia 1 to 41,500, 
German states 1 to 45,300, United Kingdom 1 to 46,000, France 1 
to 64,000, Switzerland 1 to 66,ooo, Austria 1 to 400,000, Russia 1 to 
565,000. Europe had in all 2142 newspapers, America 978, Asia 27, 
Africa 12 and Oceania 9; total 3168. Of these, 1378 were published 
in English-speaking countries (800 of them in the United States), 
having a population of 154 millions, and 1790 in other countries, 
with a population of 583 millions. 

The second summary (1886) is that given by Eugene Hat in in 
an appendix to his valuable Bibliothlque de la presse piriodioue. 
His enumeration of newspapers is as follows: France, 1640; United 
Kingdom, 1260; Prussia, 700; Italy, 500; Austria-Hungary, 365; 
Switzerland, 300; Belgium, 275; Holland, 225; Russia, 200; 
Spain, 200; Sweden and Norway, 150; Denmark, iooj United 
States, 4000. Here the proportions of papers to population are — 
Switzerland and United States 1 to 7000, Belgium 1 to 17,000, 
France and the United Kingdom 1 to 20,000, Prussia 1 to 30,000, 
Spain 1 to 75,000, Austria 1 to 100,000, Russia 1 to 300,000. Hatin 
assigns to Europe a total of 7000, to America 5000 and to the rest of 
the world 250, making in all 12,500. 

The third summary is taken from that of Henry Hubbard, pub- 
lished in his Newspaper Directory of the World (New Haven, Con- 
necticut, 1882). Its scope embraces a considerable number of serial 
publications which cannot be classed as newspapers. Still Hubbard's 
figures, which were collected (chiefly by the American consuls and 
consular agents in all parts of the world) about 1880, cannot be 
disregarded. The following are his general results: —

2. British Newspapers 
United Kingdom. 1 
The first regular English journalists may be identified with 
the writers of manuscript " news-letters/' originally the depend- 
ants of great men, each employed in keeping his own master 
or patron well-informed, during his absence from court, of all 
that happened there. The duty grew at length into a calling. 
The writer had his periodical subscription list, and instead of 
writing a single letter wrote as many letters as he had customers. 
Then one more enterprising than the rest established an " in- 
telligence office," with a staff of clerks, such as Ben Jonson's 
Cymbal depicts from the life in The Staple of News, acted in 
1625, which is the best-known dramatic notice of the news-sheets. 
" This is the outer room where my clerks sit, 
And keep their sides, the register in the midst; 
The examiner, he sits private there within ; 
And here I have my several rolls and files 
Of news by the alphabet, and all put up 
Under their heads." 

Of the earlier news-letters good examples may be seen in the 
Paston Letters, and in the Sydney Papers. Of those of later 
date specimens will be found in Knowler's Letters and 
Despatches of Strafford, and other well-known books. 
Still later examples may be seen amongst the papers 
collected by the historian Thomas Carte, preserved in 
the Bodleian Library at Oxford. Of these, several series were 
addressed to the first duke of Ormond, partly by correspondents 
in England and Ireland, partly by correspondents in Paris; others 
were addressed to successive earls of Huntingdon; others, again, 
to various members of the Wharton family. And similar valuable 
collections are to be seen in the library of the British Museum, and 
in the Record Office in London. In Edinburgh the Advocates' 
Library possesses a series of the 16th century, written by Richard 
Scudamore to Sir Philip Hoby during his embassy to Vienna. 
The MS. news-letters — some of them proceeding from writers 
of marked ability who had access to official information, and 
were able to write with, greater freedom and independence 
of tone than the compilers of the printed news — held their 
ground, although within narrowing limits, until nearly the 
middle of the 18th century. The distinction between the news- 
letter and the newspaper is pointed out in the preceding section. 
It was at one time believed that the earliest regular English 
newspaper was an English Mercurie of 1588, to which George 
Chalmers, the political writer and antiquarian, referred 
in his Life of Ruddiman (1794) as being (with others of 
the same date) in the British Museum. The falsehood 
of this supposition, which was long accepted on 
Chalmers's authority, was, however, pointed out by Thomas 
Watts, of the British Museum, in 1839, in a volume with the 
title Letter to Antonio Panizzi on the Reputed earliest printed 
Newspaper, and again in 1850, in an article in the Gentleman's 
Magazine (n.s. xxxiii. 485-491). The documents in question are 
(1) a MS. unnumbered issue of the English Mercurie, dated 
" Whitehall, July 26th, 1588 "; (2) a printed copy, No. 50, of 

	1 In the following account of early British newspapers certain 
	portions of the article by E. Edwards in the 9th ed. of the Ency. Brit. 
	have been incorporated. 

	newspapers. 

July 23, 1588; (3) a printed copy of No. 51; (4) a printed copy 
of No. 54, of November 24, 1588; (5) and thiee other MS. copies. 
These were included in a collection bequeathed to the Museum 
of Dr Birch (1766), and are inconfestably 18th-century forgeries. 
The handwriting of the spurious MSS. was identified by a letter 
among Dr Birch's correspondence as that of Philip Yorke, 
afterwards 2nd Lord Hardwicke, and there were trifling correc- 
tions in Dr Birch's handwriting, showing that he was a party 
with Yorke, the author, to the mystification. No information 
is forthcoming as to the object of it, but it is worth mentioning 
that Yorke and his brother also published a clever jeu d 'esprit 
called The Athenian Letters, purporting to be a transcript from 
a Spanish translation of letters written by a Persian agent during 
the Peloponnesian War; so that it may be inferred that this 
sort of thing recommended itself to Yorke, and not necessarily 
for any deception. 

Various English pamphlets, as well as French, Italian and 
German, occur in the 16th century with such titles as Newes from 
Spaine, and the like. In the early years of the 17th century 
they became very numerous; the Charles Burney collection in 
the British Museum is particularly valuable for this early period, 
the newsbooks and newspapers in it commencing with a " rela- 
tion " of 1603. In 1614 we find Burton (the author of the 
Anatomy of Melancholy) pointing a sarcasm against the non- 
reading habits of " the major part " by adding, " if they read a 
book at any time ... 'tis an English chronicle, Sir Huon of 
Bordeaux, Amadis de Gaul, &c, a play-book, or some pamphlet 
of news." But up to 1641, owing to the fact that to print 
domestic news was barred by the royal prerogative, the English 
periodicals which are to be considered as strictly the forerunners 
of the regular newspaper were only translations or adaptations 
of foreign periodicals containing news of what was going on 
abroad. 

There is in the British Museum a Mercurius Gallobelgicus; 
Sive return in Gallia et Belgio potissimum, Hispania quoque, 
Italia, Anglia, Germania, Polonia, Vicinisque Locis ab anno 1588 
usque ad Martium anni praesentis 15Q4 gestarum, nuncius. 
Opusculum in Sex libris qui totidem annos complectuntur, divisum 
auctore D. M. Jansonio Doccomensi Frisio. Editio altera. 
Coloniae Agrippinae. A pud Godefridum Kempensem. Anno 
MDXCIV. This production of Janson's at Cologne is a fairly 
thick octavo book, giving a Latin chronicle of events from 1587 
to 1 594, and is really a sort of annual register. It was continued 
down to 1635. The Mercurius Gallobelgicus is chiefly interesting 
because, by circulating in England, it started the idea of a 
periodical supplying foreign news, and apparently became to 
English contemporaries a type of the newfangled news-sum- 
maries. 1 In 16 14 there was published in London, a little square 
book (45 pp.), by Robert Booth, A Relation of all matters passed 
. . . since March last to the present 1614, translated according to 
the originall of Mercurius Gallobelgicus, which has the running 
title Mercurius Gallobelgicus his relation since March last. From 
a repetition of such " relations " at irregular intervals, to the 
periodical publication of news-books with a common title in a 
numbered series, was a natural development. Thus on the 1st 
of June 1 619 Ralph Rounthwaite entered at Stationers' Hall 
A Relation of all matters done in Bohemia, Austria, Poland, 
Sletia, France, &c, that is worthy of relating, since the 2nd of 
March 1618 (1619 N.S.) until the 4th of May. 2 Again at the 
beginning of November 1621 Bartholomew Downes and another 
entered in like manner The certaine and true newes from all parts 
of Germany and Poland, to this present 20 of October 1621? No 
copy of either of these papers is now known to exist. Nor is any 
copy known of the Courant or Weekly Newes from foreign parts 
of October 9,- 1621— " taken out of the High Dutch,"— men- 
tioned by John Nichols. 4 But in May 1622 we arrive at a regular 
weekly newspaper which may still be seen in the British Museum. 

	1 The title Mercurius or Mercury— ^as representing the messenger 
	of the gods — thus became a common one for English periodicals. 

	* Registers of the Stationers' Company, as printed by Edward 
	Arber, iii. 302. 

	1 Ibid. iv. 23. 4 Literary Anecdotes, iv. 38. 

The Stationers' Registers contain an entry on May 18th of A 
Currant of generall newes. Dated in 14th May last; no copy of 
this issue is preserved, but what is presumably the next number 
is to be found in the Burney collection. It is entitled " The 
23rd of May — The Weekely Newes from Italy, Germany, &*c, 
London, printed by J. D. for Nicholas Bourne and Thomas 
Archer." On many subsequent numbers the name of Nathaniel 
Butter appears in connexion sometimes with Bourne and some- 
times with Archer; so that there was probably an eventual 
partnership in the new undertaking. Archer is known as a 
publisher of "relations" since 1603; he died in 1634. Butter 
had published Newes from Spaine in 161 1, and he continued to be 
a publisher of news until 1641, if not later, 1 and died in 1664. 

For details of the history of the development of the news-book 
down to 1641, and thence to the starting of the London Gazette in 
1665, reference should be made to Mr J. B. Williams's History of 
'English Journalism (10,08), already referred to. Mr Williams, by 
his study of the materials preserved in the British Museum in the 
Burney and Thomason * collections, has considerably modified many 
of the previously accepted views as to the affiliation and authorship 
of these early English periodicals. The leading facts can only be 
summarized here. 

The Weekely Newes (1622), though the first English " Coranto," 
had no regular title connecting one number with the rest; it was 
simply "the news of the week, and so described. The. first period- 
ical with a title was a Mercurius Britannicus pubUshed by Archer 
(1625; the earliest co^y in existence being No. 16, April 7th), 
which probably lasted till the end of 1627. But the activity of 
the Coranto-makers was checked by the Star Chamber edict in 
1632 against the printing of news from foreign parts. The next 
step in the evolution of the newspaper was due to the abolition 
of the Star Chamber in 1641, and the consequent freeing of the 
Press; and at last we come to the English periodical with 
domestic news. In November 1641 begins The Head of sever all 
proceedings in the present parliament (outside title) or Diurnal 
Occurrences (inside title), the latter being the title under which 
it was soon known as a weekly; and on Jan. 31st 1642 appeared 
A Perfect Diurnal of the Passages in Parliament. These were 
printed for William Cooke, and were written apparently by 
Samuel Pecke, " the first of the patriarchs of English domestic 
journalism" (Williams). It is unnecessary here to mention 
every domestic journal which played its part in the verbal 
warfare in the Great Rebellion. The weekly Diurnals were 
soon copied by other booksellers. At first they were naturally 
on the side of the parliament. In January 1643, however, 
appeared at Oxford the first Royalist diurnal, named 
Mercurius Aulicus (continued till September 1645, and soon 
succeeded by Mercurius Academicus), which struck a higher 
literary note; its chief writer was Sir John Birkenhead. 
Mercurius Civicus, the first regularly illustrated periodical in 
London, was started by the parliamentarian Richard Collings 
on May nth, 1643 (continued to December 1646); Collings 
had also started earlier in the year the Kingdome's Weekly 
Intelligencer, which lasted till October 1649. In September 
1643 appeared another Puritan opponent of M. Aulicus in 
the Mercurius Britanicus (sic) of Captain Thomas Audley, 
which temporarily ceased publication on September 9th, 1644, 
only to be revived on September 30th by Marchamont (or 
Marchmont) Nedham, a writer who plays a prominent part in 
the journalism of this period, and to be continued till May 18th 
1646. 

In January 1647 was started the Perfect Occurrences by Henry 
Walker (" Luke Harruney "), who was not only a great journalist 

	1 It is to him that a passage in Fletcher's Fair Maid of the Inn 
	(Act iv. Sc. 2) obviously refers (written in 1625) : " It shall be the 
	ghost of some lying stationer. A spirit shall look as if butter would 
	not melt in his mouth; a new Mercurius Gallo-Belgicus" The 
	quotation also illustrates the contemporary regard paid to the 
	Mercurius Gallobelgicus. 

	'George Thomason (d. 1666) was a London bookseller who in 
	1641 began collecting contemporary pamphlets, &c. His collection 
	was ultimately bought by George III. and presented to the British 
	Museum in 1762. A catalogue was completed in 1908, with intro- 
	duction by Dr G. K. Fortescue. There is also a catalogue of early 
	English newspapers in the Bibliotheca Lindesiana, Collections and Notes 
	No. 5, of Lord Crawford (1901). 

on the parliamentary side but is important as having originated 
the introduction of advertisements into the news-books. Later 
in the year a number of new Royalist Mercuries came into the 
field from which Aulicus and Academicus had now withdrawn: 
the first was Met curious Mdanckolicus (until 1649), and the 
most important were Mercurius Pragmalicus (Sept. 1647 to 
May 1650) and Mercuricus Elencticus (Nov. 1647 to Nov. 1649). 
M. Pragmaticus was not, as has been stated, originated by 
Marchamont Nedham (who about this time turned his coat 
and became Royab'st), but in 1648-1649 he was its writer until 
he again turned parliamentarian; " history," says Mr Williams, 
" has no personage so shamelessly cynical as Marchamont Nedham, 
with his powerful pen and his political convictions ever ready 
to be enlisted on the side of the highest bidder; he even wrote 
for Charles II. in later years." Against the unlicensed Royalist . 
Mercuries in London, where the people were on the king's side, 
the parliament waged active war, but some of them managed to 
come out, although writer after writer was imprisoned, until 
the middle of 1650. Meanwhile from October 1649 to June 
1650, by a new act of parliament, the licensed press itself was 
entirely suppressed, and in 1649 two official journals were issued, 
A Brief Relation (up to October 1650) and Sever all Proceedings 
in Parliament (till September 1655), a third licensed periodical, 
A Perfect Diurnall (till September 1655), being added later in 
the year, and a fourth, Mercurius Politicus (of which Milton was 
the editor for a year or so and Marchamont Nedham one of the 
principal writers), starting on June 13th, 1650 (continuing till 
April 12th, 1660). After the middle of 1650 there was a revival 
of some of the older licensed news-books; but the Weekly 
Intelligence of the Commonwealth (July 1650 to September 1655), 
by R. Collings, was the only important newcomer up to September 
1655, when Cromwell suppressed all such publications with the 
exception of Mercurius Politicus and the Publick Intelligencer 
(October 1655 to April 1660), both being official and conducted 
by Marchamont Nedham. 

Till Cromwell's death (Sept. 3rd. 1658) .Nedham reigned alone 
in the press, but with the Rump he fell into disgrace, and in 
1659 a rival appeared in Henry Muddiman (a great writer also 
of " news-letters "), whose Parliamentary Intelligencer, renamed 
the Kingdom's Intelligencer (till August 1663), was supported 
by General Monck. Nedham's journalistic career came finally 
to an end (he died in 1678) at the hand of Monck's council of 
state in April 1660. The following announcement was published 
in the Parliamentary Intelligencer: " Whereas Marchmont 
Nedham, the author of the weekly news-books called Mercurius 
Politicus and the Publique Intelligencer is, by order of the council 
of state, discharged from writing or publishing any publique 
intelligence; the reader is desired to take notice that, by order 
of the said council, Giles Dury and Henry Muddiman are 
authorized henceforth to write and publish the said intelligence, 
the one upon the Thursday and the other upon the Monday, 
which they do intend to set out under the titles of the Parlia- 
mentary Intelligencer and of Mercurius Publicus" This arrange- 
ment with Muddiman lasted till 1663, when he was supplanted 
by Sir Roger L'Est range, who was appointed " surveyor of the 
Press." On him was conferred by royal grant — and, as it 
proved, for only a short period — " all the sole privilege of writing, 
printing, and publishing all narratives, advertisements, mercuries, 
intelligencers, diurnals and other books of public intelligence; 
. . . with power to search for and seize the unlicensed and treason- 
able schismatical and scandalous books and papers." L'Estrange 
discontinued Mercurius Politicus and Kingdom's Intelligencer 
and substituted two papers, the Intelligencer (Aug. 1st) and 
the Newes (Sept. 3rd) at a halfpenny, the former on Mondays 
and the latter on Thursdays; they were continued till January 
29th, 1666, but from the beginning of 1664 the Intelligencer 
was made consecutive with the Newes, numbered and paged as 
one. 

We come now to the origin of the famous London Gazette, 
Muddiman, obliged to devote himself solely to his news-letters, 
was associated with Joseph Williamson (under-secretary and 
afterwards secretary of state), who was for a time L'Estrange's 
assistant in the compilation of the Intelligencer} Muddiman 
organized for himself a far-spread foreign correspondence, and 
carried on the business of a news-letter writer on a larger scale 
than had till then been known. Presently L'Estrange, 
™* whose monopoly of printing was highly unpopular, 

Gazette, found his own sources of information much abridged, 
while Williamson, for his own ambitious purposes, 
entered into a complicated intrigue (analysed in detail by Williams, 
op.^cit. pp. 190 seq.) for getting the whole business into his 
hands, with Muddiman as his tool and with Muddiman's clients 
as his customers. To L'Estrange's application for renewed 
assistance Williamson replied that he could not give it, but 
would procure for him a salary of £100 a year if he w y ould give 
up his right in the news-book. 2 The Intelligencer appealed 
(Oct. 1665) to Lord Arlington, and pathetically assured him 
that the charge for " entertaining spies for information was 
£500 in the first year." 3 But L'Estrange boasted that he had 
" doubled " the size and price of the book, 4 and had brought 
the profit from £200 to £400 or £500 a year. 6 The appeal was 
in vain. At that time the great plague had driven the court to 
Oxford. The first number of the bi-weekly Oxford Gazette , 
licensed by Arlington and written by Muddiman, was published 
on the 16th November 1665. It was a " paper " of news, of the 
same size and shape as Muddiman's news-letters. With the 
publication of the 24th number (Monday, February 5th, 1665- 
1666 O.S.) the Oxford Gazette became the London Gazette. After 
the 25th number Muddiman, who saw that he was not safe in 
Williamson's hands, seceded. Williamson had the general 
control of the Gazette, and for a considerable time Charles 
Perrot, a member of Oriel College, was the acting editor. 6 
L'Estrange was soon driven out of the field, being solaced, on 
his personal appeal to the king, with a charge of £100 a year on 
the news-books (henceforth " taken into the secretaries' office ") 
and a further £200 out of secret service money for his place as 
surveyor of the press. Muddiman, meanwhile, attached himself 
to the other secretary of state, Sir W. Morice, and he was 
authorized to issue an opposition official paper, which appeared 
as Current Intelligence (June 4- Aug. 20, 1666); and though the 
Great Fire, which burnt out all the London printers, resulted in 
the reappearance, after a week's interval, of the Gazette alone, 
Muddiman's unrivalled organization of news-letters remained; 
and they continued, till his death in 1692, to be the more popular 
source of information. The Gazette, however, now remained 
for some time the only " newspaper " in the strict sense already 
mentioned. For several years it was regularly translated into 
French by one Moranville. During the Stuart reigns generally 
its contents were very meagre, although in the reign of Anne 
some improvement is already visible. More than a century after 
the establishment of the Gazette, we find Secretary Lord Wey- 
mouth addressing a circular 7 to the several secretaries of legation 
and the British consuls abroad, in which he says, " The writer of the 
Gazette has represented that the reputation of that paper is greatly 
lessened, and the sale diminished, from the small portion of foreign 
news with which it is supplied." He desires that each of them 
will send regularly all such articles of foreign intelligence as may 
appear proper for that paper, " taking particular care — as the 
Gazette is the only paper of authority printed in this country; — 
never to send anything concerning the authenticity of which there 
is the smallest doubt." From such humble beginnings has arisen 
the great repertory of State Papers, now so valuable to the writers 
and to the students of English history. The London Gazette has 
appeared twice a week (on Tuesday and Friday) in a continuous 
scries ever since 8 The editorship is a government appointment.

We come now to the Revolution. The very day after the 
departure of James II. was marked by the appearance of three 
newspapers — The Universal Intelligence, t.he English Courant 
and the London Courant. Within a few days more these were 
followed by the London Mercury, the Orange Gazette, the London 
Intelligence, the Harlem Currant and others. The Licensing Act, 
which was in force at the date of the Revolution, expired in 
1692, but was continued for a year, after which it finally ceased. 
On the appearance of a paragraph in the Flying Post of 1st April 
1697, which appeared to the House of Commons to attack the 
credit of the Exchequer Bills, leave was given to bring in a bill 
" to prevent writing, printing or publishing of any news without 
licence "; but the bill was thrown out in an early stage of its 
progress. That Flying Post which gave occasion to this attempt 
was also noticeable for a new method of printing, which it thus 
announced to its customers — " If any gentleman has a mind 
to oblige his country friend or correspondent with this account 
of public affairs, he can have it for twopence ... on a sheet 
of fine paper, half of which being left blank, he may thereon 
write his own affairs, or the material news of the day." 

In 1696 Edward Lloyd — the virtual founder of the famous 
" Lloyd's " of commerce — started a thrice-a-week paper, Lloyd's 
News, which had but a brief existence in its first shape, but 
was the precursor of the Lloyd's List of the present day. No. 
76 of the original paper contained a paragraph referring to the 
House of Lords, for the appearance of which a public apology 
must, the publisher was told, be made. He preferred to dis- 
continue his publication (February 1697). Nearly thirty years 
afterwards he in part revived it, under the title of Lloyd's List — 
published at first weekly, afterwards twice a week. 9 This dates 
from 1 726. It is now published daily. 

It was in the reign of Queen Anne that the English newspaper 
press first became really eminent for the amount of intellectual 
power and of versatile talent which was employed 
upon it. It was also in that reign that the press was ? irst a 
first fettered by the newspaper stamp. The accession dally, 
of Anne was quickly followed by the appearance of 
the first successful London daily newspaper, the Daily Courant 
(nth of March 1702-1703). Seven years earlier, in 1695, the 
Postboy had been started as a daily paper (actually the first 
in London), but only four numbers appeared. The Courant 
was published and edited by the learned printer Samuel Buckley, 
who explained to the public that " the author has taken care 
to be duly furnished with all that comes from abroad, in any 
language. ... At the beginning of each article he will quote 
the foreign paper from which it is taken, that the public, seeing 
from what country a piece of news comes, with the allowance 
of that government, may be better able to judge of the credibility 
and fairness of the relation. Nor will he take upon himself 
to give any comments, . . . supposing other people to have 
sense enough to make reflexions for themselves." Then came, 
in rapid succession, a crowd of new competitors for public 
favour, of less frequent publication. The first number of one 
of these, the Country Gentleman's Courant (1706), was given 
away gratuitously, and made a special claim to public favour 
on the ground that " here the reader is not only diverted with 
a faithful register of the most remarkable and momentary [i.e. 
momentous] transactions at home and abroad, . . . but also 
with a geographical description of the most material places 
mentioned in every article of news, whereby he is ^f reed the 
trouble of looking into maps." 

On the 19th of February 1704, whilst still imprisoned in 
Newgate for a political offence, Defoe (q.v.) began his famous 
paper, the Review. At the outset it was published, 
weekly, afterwards twice, and at length three times Review. 
a week. It continued substantially in its first form 
until July 29, 1712; and a complete set is of extreme rarity. 
From the first page to the last it is characterized by the manly 

	9 Frederick Martin, History of Lloyd's, 66-77 and 107-120. The 
	great collection of newspapers in the British Museum contains only 
	one number of Lloyd's News; but sixty-nine numbers may be seen in 
	the Bodleian Library. Of the List, also, no complete series is known

boldness and persistent tenacity with which the almost unaided 
author utters and defends his opinions on public affairs against 
a host of able and bitter assailants. Some of the numbers were 
written during travel, some in Edinburgh. But the Review 
appeared regularly. When interrupted by the pressure of the 
Stamp Act (which came into force on the ist of August 1712), 
the writer modified the form of his paper, and began a new 
series (August 2, 17 12, to June 11, 17 13). In those early and 
monthly supplements of his paper which he entitled " Advice 
from the Scandalous Club/* and set apart for the discussion of 
questions of literature and manners, and sometimes of topics 
of a graver kind, Defoe to some extent anticipated Richard 
Steele's Taller (1709) and Steele and Addison's Spectator (1711). 
In 1705 he severed those supplements from his chief newspaper, 
and published them twice a week as the Little Review. But 
they soon ceased to appear. It may here be added that in May 
i7i6,Defoe began a new monthly paper under an old title, 
Mercurius Politicus, ... "by a lover of old England." This 
journal continued to appear until September 1720. The year 
1 7 10 was marked by the appearance of the Examiner , or Re- 
marks upon Papers and Occurrences (No. 1, August 3), of which 
thirteen numbers appeared by the co-operation of Bolingbroke, 
Prior, Freind and King before it was placed under the sole control 
of Swift. The Whig Examiner, avowedly intended " to censure 
the writings of others, and to give all persons a rehearing who 
had suffered under any unjust sentence of the Examiner" 
followed on the ist September, and the Medley three weeks 
afterwards. 

This increasing popularity and influence of the newspaper 
press could not fail to be distasteful to the government of the 
day. Prosecutions were multiplied, but with small 
stamp success. At length some busy projector hit upon 

	17/2*

the expedient of a newspaper tax. The paper which 
seems to contain the first germ of the plan is still 
preserved amongst the treasury papers. It is anonymous and 
undated, but probably belongs to the year 1711. " There are 
published weekly," says the writer, " about 44,000 newspapers, 
viz. Daily Courant, London Post, English Post, London Gazette, 
Postman, Postboy, Flying Post, Review and Observator." 1 The 
duty eventually imposed (171 2) was a halfpenny on papers 
of half a sheet or less, and a penny on such as ranged from half 
a sheet to a single sheet (10 Anne, c. xix. § 101). The first results 
of the tax cannot be more succinctly or more vividly described 
than in the following characteristic passage of Swift's Journal 
to Stella (August 7, 171 2): "Do you know that Grub Street 
is dead and gone last week? No more ghosts or murders now 
for love or money. I plied it close the last fortnight, and pub- 
lished at least seven papers of my own, besides some of other 
people's; but now every single half-sbeet pays a halfpenny 
to the queen. The Observator is fallen; the Medleys are jumbled 
together with the Flying Post) the Examiner is deadly sick; 
the Spectator keeps up, and doubles its price — I know not how 
long it will hold. Have you seen the red stamp the papers are 
marked with? Methinks the stamping is worth a halfpenny" 

Swift's doubt as to the ability of the Spectator to hold out 
against the tax was justified by its discontinuance in December 
1712, Steele starting the Guardian in 1713, which only ran for 
six months. But the impost which was thus fruitful in mischief, 
by suppressing much good literature, wholly failed in keeping 
out bad. Some of the worst journals that were already in 
existence kept their ground, and the number of such ere long 
increased. 2 An enumeration of the London papers of 1714 
comprises the Daily Courant, the Examiner, the British Merchant, 
the Lover, the Patriot, the Monitor, the Flying Post, the Postboy, 
Mercator, the Weekly Pacquel and Dunton's Ghost. Another 
enumeration in 1733 includes the Daily Courant, the Craftsman, 
Fog's Journal, Mist's Journal, the London Journal, the Free

Briton, the Grub Street Journal, the Weekly Register, the Uni- 
versal Spectator, the Auditor, the Weekly' Miscellany, the London 
Crier, Read's Journal, Oedipus or the Postman Remounted, the 
St James's Post, the London Evening Post and the London 
Daily Post, which afterwards became better known as the Public 
Advertiser. Part of this increase may fairly be ascribed to 
political corruption. In 1742 the committee of the House of 
Commons appointed to inquire into the political conduct of the 
earl of Orford reported to the House that during the last ten 
years of the Walpole ministry there was paid, out of public 
money, no " less a sum than £50,077, 18s. to authors and printers 
of newspapers, such as the Free Briton, Daily Courant, Gazetteer 
and other political papers." 3 But some part of the payment 
may well have been made for advertisements. Towards the 
middle of the century the provisions and the penalties of the 
Stamp Act were made more stringent. Yet the number of 
newspapers continued to rise. Dr Johnson, who in 
1750 started his twopenny bi-weekly Rambler, and jo„ nson * 8 
in 1758 his weekly Idler, writing in the latter bears ante. 
testimony to the still growing thirst for news: " Jour- 
nals are daily multiplied, without increase of knowledge. The 
tale of the morning paper is told in the evening, and the narra- 
tives of the evening are bought again in the morning. These 
repetitions, indeed, waste time, but they do not shorten it. The 
most eager peruser of news is tired before he has completed bis 
labour; and many a man who enters the coffee-house in his 
nightgown and slippers is called away to his shop or his dinner 
before he has well considered the state of Europe." Five years 
before {i.e. in 1753) the aggregate number of copies of news- 
papers annually sold in England, on an average of three years, 
amounted to 7,411,757. In 1760 it had risen to 9,464,790, 
and in 1767 to 11,300,980. In 1776 the number of newspapers 
published in London alone had increased to fifty-three. \ 

When Johnson wrote his sarcastic strictures on the newspapers 
that were the contemporaries and, in a sense, the rivals of the 
Idler, the news writers' had fallen below the standard of an 
earlier day. A generation before the newspaper was often much 
more of a political organ than of an industrial venture. All of 
the many enterprises of Defoe in this field of journalism united 
indeed both characteristics. But if he was a keen tradesman, 
he was also a passionate politician. And not a few of his fellow- 
workers in that field were conspicuous as statesmen no less 
than as journalists. Even less than twenty years before the 
appearance of Johnson's remarks, men of the mental calibre 
of Henry Fielding were still to be found amongst the editors 
and writers of newspapers. The task had fallen to a different 
class of men in 1750. 

The history of newspapers during the long reign of George 
III. is a history of the struggle for freedom of speech in the face 
of repeated criminal prosecutions, in which individual 
writers and editors were defeated and severely punished, ^"cu- 
while the Press itself derived new strength from the 1font™' 
protracted conflict, and turned ignominious penalties 
into signal triumphs. From the days of Wilkes's North Briton 
onwards (see Wilkes, John: it was started in 1761), every 
conspicuous newspaper prosecution gave tenfold currency to 
the doctrines that were assailed. In the earlier part of this 
period men who were mere traders in politics — whose motives 
were obviously base and their lives contemptible — became for 
a time powers in the state, able to brave king, legislature and 
law courts, by virtue of the simple truth that a free people must 
have a free press. One of the minor incidents of the North 
Briton excitement (Wilkes's prosecution in 1763) led indirectly 
to valuable results with reference to the much-vexed question of 
parliamentary reporting. During the discussions respecting 
the Middlesex election, Almon, a bookseller, collected from 
members of the House of Commons some particulars of the 
debates, and published them in the London Evening Post. The 
success which attended these reports induced the proprietors 
of the St James's Chronicle to employ a reporter to collect notes

	Parliamentary History, xii. 814. 

	evening press. 

in the lobby and at the coffee-houses. This repeated infraction 
of the privilege of secret legislation led to the memorable proceed- 
ings of the House of Commons in 1771, with their fierce debates, 
angry resolutions, and arbitrary imprisonments — all resulting, 
at length, in that tacit concession of publicity of discussion which 
in the main, with brief occasional exceptions, has ever since 
prevailed. 

Evening journalism in England started originally with supple- 
mental editions of the morning papers, giving the latest foreign 
war news. In July 1695, when William III. was 
London fighting France in the Netherlands, a " Postscript to 
the Pacquet-boat from Holland to Flanders " was 
published with special advices from the seat of war; 
and from that time there were frequent afternoon issues of 
morning journals, giving war news. In August 1706 a " Six at 
Night " evening paper was started in London. The first London 
evening paper of any importance, however, was the Courier 
(1792), which during the latter part of the Napoleonic War, with 
Mackintosh, Coleridge and Wordsworth among its contributors, 
became one of the chief papers of the day. It was edited suc- 
cessively by Daniel Stuart, William Mudford, Eugenius Roche, 
John Gait, James Stuart and Laman Blanchard. In 1827 a 
twenty-fourth share in the paper sold for 5000 guineas, but it 
gradually declined and came to an end in 1842, when it was 
incorporated by the Globe (still existing). 

The principal metropolitan newspapers at different periods 
of George III/s reign were the Public Advertiser, the Morning 

ndon P os h the Morning Chronicle, the Morning Herald 
press in and finally The Times. Of these the Morning Post 
George and The Times, still existing, are dealt with later. Of 
ilL * s the three which eventually ceased to exist, the first 
was known in 1726 as the London Daily Post and 
General Advertiser. In 1738 the first part of this title was 
dropped, and in 1752 General Advertiser was altered into Public 
Advertiser j a name which the letters of Junius made so famous. 
Many of these had appeared before the smallest perceptible 
effect was produced on the circulation of the paper; but when 
the "Letter to the King" came out (19th December 1769, 
almost a year from the beginning of the series) it caused an 
addition of 1750 copies to the ordinary impression. The effect 
of subsequent letters was variable; but when Junius ceased to 
write the monthly sale of the paper had risen to 83,950. This 
was in December 1771. Seven years earlier the monthly sale 
had been but 47,515. It now became so valuable a property 
that shares in it were sold, according to John Nichols, " as 
regularly as those of the New River Company." But the 
fortunes of the Advertiser declined almost as rapidly as they had 
risen. It continued to appear until 1798, and then expired, 
being amalgamated with the commercial paper called the Public 
Ledger (dating from 1759). Actions for libel were brought 
against the paper by Edmund Burke in 1784, and by William 
Pitt in 1785, and in both suits damages were given. 

The Morning Chronicle was begun in 1769. William Woodfall 
was its printer, reporter and editor, and continued to conduct 
it until 1789. James Perry succeeded him as editor, and so 
continued, with an interval during which the editorship was in 
the hands of Mr Sergeant Spankie, until his death in 1821. 
Perry's editorial functions were occasionally discharged in 
Newgate in consequence of repeated prosecutions for political 
libel. In 1819 the daily sale reached nearly 4000. It was sold 
in 1823 to Mr Clement, the purchase-money amounting to 
£42,000. Mr Clement held it for about eleven years, and then 
sold it to Sir John Easthope for £16,000. It was then, and 
until 1843, edited by John Black, who numbered amongst 
his staff Albany Fonblanque, Charles Dickens and John Payne 
Collier, the circulation being about 6000. The paper continued 
to be distinguished by much literary ability, but not by com- 
mercial prosperity. In 1849 (the circulation having fallen to 
3000) it became the joint property of the duke of Newcastle, Mr 
W. E. Gladstone and some of their political friends; and by 
them, in 1854, it was sold to Mr Sergeant Glover. From 1848 
to 1854 Douglas Cook (afterwards of the Saturday Review) was 
editor. At length the Morning Chronicle ended in the Bankruptcy 
Court, after an existence of more than ninety years. The 
Morning Herald was founded and first edited by Henry Bate 
(Sir Henry Bate Dudley) in 1781, and came to an end at the 
close of 1869; for some time it was a popular Tory paper, and 
from 1835 to 1845 had a circulation of about 6000. 

The development of the Press was enormously assisted by 
the gradual abolition of the " taxes on knowledge," and also 
by the introduction of a cheap postal system. In Volition 
1756 an additional halfpenny was added to the tax of taxes 
of 171 2. In 1765 and in 1773 various restrictive on know* 
regulations were imposed. In 1789 the three-halfpence ied x e * 
was increased to twopence, in 1798 to twopence-halfpenny, 
in 1804 to threepence-halfpenny, and in 1815 to fourpence, 
less a discount of 20%. Penalties of all kinds were also 
increased, ;and obstructive regulations were multiplied. In 
the course of the struggle between this constantly enhanced 
taxation and the irrepressible desire for cheap newspapers, more 
than seven hundred prosecutions for publishing unstamped 
journals were instituted, and more than five hundred were 
imprisoned, sometimes for considerable periods. As the prosecu- 
tions multiplied, and the penalties became more serious, Poor 
Man's Guardians, Democrats, Destructives and their congeners 
multiplied also, and their revolutionary tendencies increased 
in a still greater ratio. Blasphemy was added to sedition. 
Penny and halfpenny journals were established which dealt 
exclusively with narratives of gross vice and crime, and which 
vied with each other in every kind of artifice to make vice and 
crime attractive. Between the years 1831 and 1835 many 
scores of unstamped newspapers made their appearance. The 
political tone of most of them was fiercely revolutionary. Prose- 
cution followed prosecution; but all failed to suppress the 
obnoxious publications. 

To Bulwer'Lytton, the novelist and politician (Baron Lytton), 
and subsequently to Milner Gibson and Richard Cobden, is 
chiefly due the credit of grappling with this question in the 
House of Commons in a manner which secured first the reduction 
of the tax to a penny on the 15th of September 1836, and then 
its total abolition at last in 1855. The measure for the final 
abolition of the stamp tax was substantially prepared by W. E. 
Gladstone during his chancellorship of the exchequer in 1854, 
but was carried by his successor in 1855. The number of news- 
papers established from the early part of 1855, when the repeal 
of the duty had become a certainty, and continuing in existence 
at the beginning of 1857, amounted to 107; 26 were metropolitan 
and 81 provincial. Of the latter, the majority belonged to 
towns which possessed no newspaper whatever under the Stamp 
Acts, and the price of nearly one-third of them was but a penny. 
In some cases, however, a portion of these new cheap papers 
of 1857 was printed in London, usually with pictorial illustrations, 
and to this was added a local supplement containing the news of 
the district. 

Amongst the earliest results of the change in newspaper law 
made in 1855 was the establishment in quick succession of a 
series of penny metropolitan local papers, chiefly suburban, of 
a kind very different from their unstamped forerunners. They 
spread rapidly, and attained considerable success, chiefly as 
advertising sheets, and as sometimes the organs, more often 
the critics, of the local vestries and other administrations. One 
of them, the Clerkenwell News and Daily Chronicle, so prospered 
in the commercial sense, being crowded with advertisements, 
that it sold for £30,000, and was then transformed into the 
London Daily Chronicle (28th May 1877). Another conspicuous 
result of the legislation of 1855 was an enormous increase in the 
number and influence of what are known as " class papers " 
and professional and trade papers. The duties on paper itself 
were finally abolished in 1861. 

"Taxes on knowledge" having thus been abolished, the 
later developments in newspaper history are mainly connected 
with the increase in number, due largely to the spread of educa- 
tion, the improvements in machinery and distribution and in 
collection of news, the constant adaptation to the new demands 
of a wider public, and the progress in the art* of advertising 
as applied to the Press. The following sections on the more 
important newspapers in London and the Provinces fill in the 
remaining details of the history of the British Press, so far 
as they are substantially important or interesting. Much that 
is in its nature ephemeral or trivial is necessarily passed 
over. 

Modern London Newspapers, 

The Morning Post (oldest of existing London daily papers) dates 
from 1772. For some years it was in the hands of Henry Bate 
"Mornlar ^* r Henry Bate Dudley), and it attained some degree of 
Posf temporary popularity, though of no very enviable sort. 
In 1795 the entire copyright, with house and printing 
materials, was sold for £600 to Peter and Daniel Stuart, who quickly 
raised the position of the Post by enlisting Sir James Mackintosh 
and the poet Coleridge in its service, and also by giving unremitting 
attention to advertisements and to the copious supply of incidental 
news and amusing paragraphs. There has been much controversy 
about the share which Coleridge had in elevating the Post from 
obscurity to eminence. That he greatly promoted this result there 
can be no doubt. His famous '* Character of Pitt," published in 
1800, was especially successful, and created a demand for the par- 
ticular number in which it appeared that lasted for weeks, a thing 
almost withoufrprecedent. Coleridge wrote for this paper from 1795 
until 1802, and during that period its circulation in ordinary rose 
from 350 copies, on the average, to 4500. Whatever the amount of 
rhetorical hyperbole in Fox's saying — recorded as spoken in the 
House of Commons — " Mr Coleridge's essays in the Morning Post 
led to the rupture of the treaty of Amiens," it is none the less a 
striking testimony, not only to Coleridge's powers as a^ publicist, 
but to the position which the newspaper press had won, in spite of 
innumerable obstacles at that time. The list of his fellow- workers 
in the Post is a most brilliant and varied one. Besides Mackintosh, 
Southey and Arthur Young, it included a galaxy of poets. Many of 
the lyrics of Moore, many of the social verses of Mackworth Praed, 
some of the noblest sonnets of Wordsworth, were first published in 
the columns of the Post. And the story of the paper, in its early 
days, had tragic as well as poetic episodes. ^ In consequence of 
offence taken at some of its articles, the editor and proprietor, 
Nicholas Byrne (who succeeded Daniel Stuart), was assaulted and 
murdered whilst sitting in his office. 

Up to about 1850 the history of the Morning Post offers little 
to record; with the Morning Chronicle and Morning Herald, and 
having a smaller circulation than either of them, it was being rapidly 
eclipsed in London journalism by The Times (see below), and in 1847 
only sold some three thousand copies. Heavily in debt to Messrs J. 
andT. B. Crompton, the paper manufacturers, it had been taken over 
by them; and in that Vear the management was entrusted to Peter 
Borthwick (1804-1852), a Scotsman who, after graduation both at 
Edinburgh and Cambridge, had taken to politics in the Conservative 
interest and had sat in parliament for -Evesham from 1835 to 1838 
and from 1841 to 1847, when he was almost ruined by fighting an 
election petition in which he was unseated. Peter Borthwick took 
the task of reviving the paper seriously in hand, and in a few years 
was already improving its position when he fell ill and died ; and he 
was succeeded in 1852 by his son Algernon Borthwick, afterwards 
Lord Glenesk (1 830-1 908). The later history of the paper is prim- 
arily connected with its practical re-establishment and successful 
conduct under the latter. Algernon Borthwick had been its Paris 
correspondent from 1850, and had shown social gifts and journalistic 
acumen of great promise. When he became managing editor in 
1852 he devoted himself with such energy to the work that in seven 
years the debt on the business had been paid off. He gave the paper 
a strong. political colour, Conservative, Imperialist and Protectionist ; 
and in the 'fifties and 'sixties Borthwick was a keen supporter of 
Lord Palmerston. After the death of Mr Crompton, his nephew, 
Mr Rideout, the principal surviving partner in the paper manu- 
facturing firm, was so impressed with Borthwick's success that he 
vested the entire control of the paper in him for life; and on Mr 
Rideout 's death in 1877, Borthwick was enabled, by the help of 
his friend Andrew Montague, to buy the property and become sole 
proprietor. The Morning Post had now become, largely through 
Borthwick's own social qualities, the principal organ of the fashion- 
able world; but in 1881 he took what was then considered the 
hazardous step of reducing its price from threepence to a penny, 
and appealing no longer to the " threepenny public " with The 
Times but to a wider clientele with the Daily Telegraph and Standard. 
The result was a ten-fold increase in circulation and a financial 
success exceeding all anticipations. Borthwick himself, who was 
knighted in 1880, and was created a baronet in 1887, had entered 
parliament in 1880 for Evesham, and from 1885 to 1895 sat for South 
Kensington, being finally raised to the peerage in 1895. His political 
gifts naturally increased the influence of the paper; he supported 
the " Tory democracy " and was an active worker for the Primrose 
League, of which he was three times chancellor; and the Morning 
Post, under his control, became one of the great organs of opinion 
on the Conservative side. From 1880 onwards he devolved the 
editorial duties on others, at first Sir William Hardman, and then 
successively Mr A. K. Moore, Mr Algernon Locker, Mr James Nicol 
Dunn (from 1897 to 1905; -afterwards editor of the Manchester 
Courier) and Mr Fabian Ware; under them the literary standard of 
the paper was kept at a high level, and constant improvements were 
introduced; and the staff included a number of well-known writers, 
notably Mr Spencer Wilkinson (b. 1853), who in 1909 was appointed 
professor of military history at Oxford. From 1897 till his death in 
1905, at the age of thirty-two, Lord Glenesk's son, Oliver Borthwick, 
had much to do with the managerial side. On Lord Glenesk's own 
death on the 24th November 1908, the proprietorship passed to the 
trustees of his only surviving child, a daughter, who in 1893 had 
married the 7th Earl Bathurst. 

The Times 1 is usually dated from the 1st of January 1788, but 
was really started by John Walter on the 1st of January 1785, under 
the title of The London Daily Universal Register, printed 
logo graphically. On its reaching its 940th issue its name ^ be „ 
was changed. The logographic or "word-printing" process Times. 
had been invented by a printer named Henry Johnson several years 
before, and found a warm advocate in John Walter, who expounded 
its peculiarities, at great length in No. 510 of his Daily Universal 
Register. In a later number he stated, very amusingly, his reasons 
for adopting the altered title, which the enterprise and ability of his 
successors (see Walter, John) made world-famous. Within two 
years John Walter had his share in the Georgian persecutions of the 
press, by successive sentences to three fines and to three several 
imprisonments in Newgate, chiefly for having stated that the prince 
of Wales and the dukes of York and Clarence had so misconducted 
themselves " as to incur the just disapprobation of his Majesty." 
In 1803 the management was transferred (together with the joint 
proprietorship of the journal) to his son, John Walter (2), by whom 
it was carried on with extraordinary energy and consummate ability, 
and at the same time with marked independence. To Lord Sid- 
mouth's government he gave a general but independent support. 
That of Pitt he opposed, especially on the questions of the Catamaran 
expedition and the malversations of Lord Melville. This opposition 
was resented by depriving the elder Walter of the printing for the 
customs department, by the withdrawal of government advertise- 
ments from The Times, and also, it is said, by the systematic deten- 
tion at the outports of the foreign intelligence addressed to its editor. 
John Walter the Second, however, was strong and resolute enough 
to brave the government. He organized a better system of news 
transmission than had ever before existed. He introduced steam- 
printing (1814) and repeatedly improved its mechanism (see Print- 
ing) ; and although modern machines may now seem to thrust into 
insignificance a press of which it was at first announced as a notable 
triumph that " no less than 1100 sheets are impressed in one hour," 
yet the assertion was none the less true that The Times of 29th 
November 1814 " presented to the public the practical result of the 
greatest improvement connected with printing since the discovery 
of the art itself." The effort to secure for The Times the best attain- 
able literary talent in all departments kept at least an equal pace 
with those which were directed towards the improvement of its 
mechanical resources. And thus it came to pass that a circulation 
which did not, even in 181 5, exceed on the average 5000 copies 
became, in 1834, 10,000; in 1840, 18,500; in 1844, 23,000; in 1851, 
40,000; and in 1854, 51,648. In the year last named the average 
circulation of the other London dailies was — Morning Advertiser, 
7644; Daily News, 4160; Morning Herald, 3712; Morning Chronicle, 
2800; Morning Post, 2667; so that the supremacy of The Times can 
readily be understood. 

Sir John Stoddart, afterwards governor of Malta, edited The Times 
for several years prior to 1 816. He was succeeded by Thomas Barnes, 
who for many years wrote largely in the paper. When his health 
began to fail the largest share of the editorial work came into the 
hands of Captain Edward Sterling — the contributor about a quarter 
of a century earlier of a noteworthy series of political letters signed 
" Vetus," the Paris correspondent of The Times in 1814 and subse- 
quent eventful years, and afterwards for many years the most 
conspicuous among its leader-writers. 1 From 1841 to 1877 the chief 
editor was John Thadeus Delane, who had his brother-in-law G. W. 
Dasent for assistant-editor, and another brother-in-law, Mowbray 
Morris, as business manager. By the time of the second John 
Walter's^ death (18A7) the substantial monopoly of The Times in 
London journalism had been established; and under the proprietor- 
ship of the third John Walter the result of the labour of Delane as 
editor, and of the brilliant staff of contributors whom he directed, 
among whom Henry Reeve was conspicuous as regards foreign affairs,

	S. V. Makower, issued by The Times in 1904, " The History of The 
	Times "; and the article by Hugh Chisholm on " The Times, 1785- 
	1908 " in the National Review (May 1908). 

	* See Life of John Sterling, by Carlyle, who says of him at this time : 
	" The emphatic, big-voiced, always influential and often strongly 
	unreasonable Times newspaper was the express emblem of Edward 
	Sterling. He, more than any other man, . . . was The Times, and 
	thundered through it, to the shaking of the spheres." The nick- 
	name of " The Thunderer," for The Times, came in vogue in his day. 

was to turn the " favourite broadsheet " of the English public into 
the " leading journal of the world." When Delane retired, he was 
succeeded as editor by Thomas Chenery, and on his death in 1884 
by George Earle Buckle (b. 1854). At the beginning of 1908 con- 
siderable changes took place in the proprietorial side of The Times, 
which was converted into a company, with Mr A. F. Walter (chief 
proprietor since 189O as chairman and Mr C. Moberly Bell (b. 1847; 
manager since 1890) as managing director; the financial control 
passing into the hands of Lord Northcliffe. 

In the history of The Times its influence on the mechanical side of 
newspaper work was very great. The increasing circulation of The 
Times between the years 1840 and 1850 made an improvement in the 
printing-presses necessary, as sometimes the publication could not be 
completed before the afternoon. To meet this want the Applegath 
vertical press was introduced in 1848 and the American Hoe ten- 
feeder press in 1858. Meanwhile the idea of stereotyping from the 
movable types had been making steady progress. About the year 
1856, however, a Swiss named Dellagana introduced to The Times 
Kroning's idea of casting from papier-m^che instead of plaster, 
and was allowed to experiment in The Times office. After a time 
the invention was so much improved that matrices of pages could be 
taken and the stereotype plates fixed bodily on the printing machine 
in place of the movable type. This cleared the way for the intro- 
duction of the famous Walter press. Hitherto only one v set of 
" formes " could be used, as the type was set up once only — one side 
of the paper being worked on one machine and the sheets then taken 
to another machine to be " perfected." Stereotyping enabled the 
formes to be multiplied to any extent, as several plates could be cast 
from one matrix. Mr MacDonald, the manager of The Times, had 
devoted himself for several years to the production of a press which 
could print papers on both sides in one operation from a large reel 
of paper, the web of paper being cut into the required size after print- 
ing, instead of each sheet being " laid on " by a man and then printed. 
After years of experiment the Walter press was introduced into the 
Times machine-room in 1869, and the question of printing great 
numbers in a short time was solved. Each press turned out 12,000 
sheets per hour, and it was therefore only a question of multiplying 
the stereo plates and presses to obtain any number of printed papers 
by a certain time. Meanwhile Messrs Hoe had set about producing 
something even quicker and better than the Walter press. They 
succeeded in accomplishing this by multiplying the reels of paper on 
each press, and also adding folders and stitchers. The result was the 
production of over 36,000 sheets per hour from each machine. These 
presses were adopted by The Times in 1895. 

In 1868 the question of composing machines for the quicker 
setting-up of type was taken up by The Times. A German named 
Kastenbein had an invention which he brought to the notice of The 
Times, and arrangements were made for him to continue his ex- 
periments in The Times office. In a couple of years a machine was 
made, which was worked and improved until in 1874 several machines 
were ready to set up a portion of the paper; but it was not until 
1879 that the arrangements were sufficiently advanced to make 
certain that they coufd do all that was wanted from them. The 
ic traduction of composing machines, and the necessary alterations 
in the office arrangements which followed, led to some trouble 
among the compositors, which in 1880 culminated in a partial strike ; 
but a part of the staff remaining loyal, the printer was able by extra 
effort to produce the paper at the proper time on the morning 
following the strike. Various improvements were made, until one 
machine was able to set up as many as 298 lines of The Times in one 
hour, equal to 16,688 separate types. A system of. telephoning the 
parliamentary report from the House of Commons direct to the com- 
positor was begun in 1885, and was continued until the House decided 
to rise at midnight, which enabled the more economical method of 
composing direct from the " copy " to be resumed. 

Ever since the introduction of the composing machines the business 
had been much hampered by the question of" distribution " — that 
is, the breaking-up and sorting of the types after use. Kastenbein 
had invented a distributing machine to accompany his composing 
machine, but it proved to be unsatisfactory. Various systems were 
tried at The Times office, but for many years the work of the 
composing machines was to some extent crippled by the distribu- 
tion difficulty ^ This had been recognized by Mr Frederick Wicks 
(d. 19 10), the inventor of the Wicks Rotary Type-casting Machine, 
who for many years had been working at a machine which would 
cast new type so quickly and so cheaply as to do away with the old 
system of distribution and substitute new type every day. In 1899 
his machine was practically perfect, and The Times entered into a 
contract with him to supply any quantity of new type every day > 
The difficult question of distribution was thus surmounted, and 
composition by machines placed on a satisfactory basis. 

Thus during the last half of the 19th century The Times continued 
to take the lead in new inventions relating to the printing of a news- 
paper, just as it had in the fifty years preceding. The three most 
important advances during the later period were practically worked 
0U j at ^ Times office — namely, fast-printing presses, stereotyping 
and machine composing, and without these it is safe to say that the 
cheap newspaper of the present day could not exist. Further in- 
dications of the enterprise of The Times in taking up journalistic 
novelties may also be seen in its organizing a wireless telegraphy 
service, with a special steamer, in the Far East, at the opening of the 
Russo-Japanese War. 

The price at which The Times has been sold has been changed at 
various dates: in 1796 to 4jd., 1799 to 6d., 1809 to 6£d., 1815 to 7d., 
1836 to 5d., 1855 to 4d., 1861 (Oct. 1) to 3d., and in 1904 (still 
remaining at 3d.) it started a method of payment by subscription 
which gave subscribers an advantage in one form or another and thus 
in reality reduced the price further. In 1905 this advantage took 
the form of the price (3d.) covering a subscription to The Times 
Book Club, a circulating library and book-shop on novel lines 
(see Bookselling and Publishing). 

The first number of the paper contained 57 brief advertisements, 
but as it grew in repute and in size its advertising revenue became 
very large, and with the growth of this revenue came pari passu 
the means of spending more money on the contents. As far back as 
1 861 a single issue had contained 105 columns of advertisements, 
and another 98. Prior to 1884 the paper had only on two occasions 
consisted of 24 pages in a single issue. Between that year and 1902 
more than 80 separate issues of this size were published, many of 
them containing over 80 columns of advertisements. Of two issues, 
one containing the news of the death and the other the account of 
the funeral of Queen Victoria, 140,000 copies were printed. From 
that time issues of 20 pages and over became an ordinary matter: 
and on May 24 ,1909 (Empire Day), The Times signalized the occasion 
by bringing out a huge supplement of 72 pages full of articles on 
Imperial topics. 

The Times has long stood in a class by itself among newspapers, 
owing to its abundance of trustworthy news, its high literary standard 
and its command of the ablest writers, who, however, are generally 
anonymous in its columns. It has always claimed to be a national 
rather than a party organ. It was Liberal in its politics in the 
Reform days, but became more and more Conservative and Im- 
perialist when the Unionist and anti-Home Rule era set in. On the 
conversion of Mr Gladstone to Home Rule, The Times was, indeed, 
largely instrumental in forming the Liberal-Unionist party. In the 
course of its vigorous campaign against Irish Nationalism it published 
as part of its case a series of articles on " Parnellism and Crime,'* 
including what were alleged to be facsimile reproductions of letters- 
from Mr Parnell showing his complicity with the Phoenix Park 
murders. The history of this episode, and of the appointment of 
the Special Commission of investigation by the government, is told 
under Parnell. One of the strongest features of The Times has been, 
always its foreign correspondence. 

Among leading incidents in the history of The Times a few may be 
more particularly mentioned.^ In 1840 the Paris correspondent of 
the paper (Mr O'Reilly) obtained information respecting a gigantic 
scheme of forgery which had been planned in France, together with 
particulars of the examination at Antwerp of a minor agent in the 
conspiracy, who had been there, almost by chance, arrested. All 
that he could collect on the subject, including the names of the 
chief conspirators, was published by TJie Times on the 26th of May 
in that year, under the heading "Extraordinary and Extensive 
Forgery and Swindling Conspiracy on the Continent (Private 
Correspondence)." The project contemplated the almost simultane- 
ous presentation at the chief banking-houses throughout the Con- 
tinent of forged letters of credit, purporting to be those of Glyn & 
Company v to a very large amount; and its failure appears to have 
been in a great degree owing to the exertions made, and the re- 
sponsibility assumed, by The Times. One of the persons implicated 
brought an action for libel against the paper, which was tried at 
Croydon in August 1841, with a verdict for the plaintiff, one farthing 
damages. ^ A subscription towards defraying the heavy expenses 
(amounting to more than £5000) which The Times had incurred was 
speedily opened, but the proprietors declined to profit by it; and 
the sum which had been raised was devoted to the foundation of 
two " Times scholarships, " in connexion with Christ's Hospital and 
the City of London School. Three years afterwards The Times 
rendered noble public service in a different direction. It used its 
vast power with vigour — at the expense of materially checking the 
growth of its own advertisement fund — by denouncing the fraudulent 
schemes which underlay the *' railway mania " of 1845. The 
Parnell affair has already been mentioned. And more recently the 
" book war," arising out of the attack by the combined publishers 
on The Times Book Club in 1906, was prosecuted by The Times 
with great vigour, until in 1908 it came quietly to an end. 

Various adjuncts to The Times, issued by its proprietors, have 
still to be mentioned. The Mail, published three times a week 
at the price of 2d. per number, gives a summary of two days' issue 
of The Times. The Times Weekly Edition (begun in 1877) is pub- 
lished every Friday at 2d., and gives an epitome of The Times for 
the six days. The Law Reports (begun in 1884) are conducted by a 
special staff of Times law reporters. Commercial Cases deals with 
cases of a commercial nature. Issues is a useful half-yearly com- 
pilation of all the company announcements and demands for new 
capital, taken from the advertisement columns of The Times. 

In 1897 TJie Times started a weekly literary organ under the title 
of Literature. In 1901, however, a weekly literary supplement to 
The Times was issued instead, and Literature passed into the hands 
of the proprietor of the Academy, with which paper it was incor- 
porated. The " Literary Supplement, " which appears each Thursday 
(at first on Fridays), is printed in a different form, and separately 
paged. In 1904 a " Financial and Commercial Supplement " (at 
first on Mondays, and later on Fridays) was added; in 1905 an 
"Engineering Supplement" (Wednesdays), and in 1910 a "Woman's 
Supplement. ' 

The publishing department of The Times also invaded several 
new fields of enterprise. The Times Atlas was first published in 
1895, and this publication was supplemented by that of The Times 
(previously Longmans') Gazetteer. A much larger amd more im-. 
portant venture was the issue in 1898 of a reprint of the ninth 
edition of the Encyclopaedia Britannica at less than half the original 
price, on a new system of terms (known as The Times system) that 
•enabled the purchaser to receive the whole work at once and to pay 
foHt by a series of equal monthly payments. This was followed by 
a similar sale of the Century Dictionary and of a reprint of the first 
fifty years of Punch ; and eleven new volumes of the Encyclopaedia 
Brttannica, supplementing the ninth edition, and forming with it 
the tenth edition, were issued by The Times in 1902 on similar 
terms (see Encyclopaedia) . 

In 1895 The Times, through its Vienna correspondent, purchased 
from Dr Moritz Busch the MS. and entire copyright of his journals, 
containing a very minute record of his intimate relations with 
Bismarck. It was stipulated in the contract that these were not to 
be published until after the death of the prince. That event occurred 
on the 30th July 1898, and on the 12th September of the same year 
The Times published through Messrs Macmillan (in 3 vols.) Bismarck: 
Some Secret Pages of his History, by Dr Moritz Busch. 

The Times History of the War in South Africa arose out of a desire 
to preserve in a more readable form the excellent work done by the 
numerous Times correspondents in South Africa. When originally 
projected in the early days of 1900 it was hoped that the war would 
be of short duration, and that the history of it could be rapidly com- 
pleted. The length of the war naturally upset all these calculations, 
and eventually the sixth and last volume was only issued in 1909. 

For a long period after the establishment of The Times, no effort 
to found a new daily London morning newspaper was ever con- 
spicuously successful. Among unfruitful attempts were — (1) the 
New Times, started by Dr (afterwards Sir John) Stoddart, upon his 
departure from Printing-House Square; (2) the Representative 
(1824), established by John Murray, under circumstances which 
seemed at the outset exceptionally promising; (3) the Constitutional, 
begun in 1836 and carried on for eight months by a joint-stock 
company, exceptionally favoured in having for editor and sub- 
editor Laman Blanchard and Thornton Hunt, with a staff of con- 
tributors which included Thackeray, Douglas Jerrold and Bulwer; 
(4) the Morning Star, founded in 1856, and kept afloat until 1870, 
when it was merged in the Daily News; (5) in 1867, the Day, for 
six weeks only; (6) in 1873 the Hour, for three years; (7) in 1878, 
the Daily Express, which soon failed. 

A measure of greater success followed the establishment (1794) 
of the Morning Advertiser, under special circumstances. It was the 
"Mora- joint-stock venture of a large society of licensed victuallers, 
lav Ad' amongst whom subscription to the paper was the condi- 
vertiser " t ' on ° membership. For nearly sixty years its circulation 
lay almost entirely in public-houses and coffee-houses, but 
amongst them it sold nearly 5000 copies daily, and it yielded a steady 
profit of about £6000 a year. Then, by the ability and enterprise 
-of an experienced editor, James Grant (1 802-1 879), it was within 
four years raised to a circulation of nearly 8000, and to an aggregate 
profit of £12,000 a year. In 1891 its price was reduced from three- 
pence to a penny. 

The history of the Daily News, founded in 1846, has been told by 
Mr Justin McCarthy and Sir John R. Robinson in a volume of 
"political and social retrospect" published in 1896 on 
the occasion of its jubilee. It could boast of having 
continuously been the champion of Liberal ideas and 
principles — of what (so long as Mr Gladstone lived) might be called 
official Liberalism at home and of liberty abroad. It hecame a 
penny paper in 1868. Its only rival in the history of Liberal journal- 
ism in London for many years was the Morning Star, which in 1870 
it absorbed. Notably, it led British public opinion in foreign affairs 
as champion of the North in the American Civil War, of the cause 
of Italy, of the emancipation of Bulgaria from the Turk and of 
Armenia. Its early editors were Charles Dickens (21st January- 
March 1846), John Forster (March-October 1846), E. E. Crowe 
(1847-1851), F. K. Hunt (1851-1*54), W. Weir (1854-1858), T. 
Walker (1 858-1 869). In 1868 the price was reduced to a penny, 
and it came under the management of Mr (afterwards Sir) John K. 
Robinson (1828-1903), who only retired in 1901. Its later editors 
included (1868-1886) Mr F. H. Hill (the brilliant author of Political 
Portraits), and subsequently Sir John Robinson, as managing 
editor, in conjunction with Mr P. W. Clayden (1 827-1 902), the 
author of Life of Samuel Rogers, England under the Coalition and 
other able works, as political and literary editor, down to 1856, 
and Mr E.T.Cook from 1896101901. Mr Cook, during the negotia- 
tions with the Boer government in 1899, strongly supported Sir 
Alfred Milner; and under him the Daily News, as an exponent of 
Lord Rosebery's Liberal Imperialism, gave no countenance to the 
pro-Boer views of some of the more active members of the Liberal 
party. In 1901, however, the proprietary changed, and Mr George 

	"Daffy News." 

Cadbury became chief owner of the paper. Mr E. T. Cook, who 
had shown brilliant ability as a publicist, but whose views on the 
Boer War were not shared by the new proprietor, retired, subse- 
quently joining the staff of the Daily Chronicle; the journal then 
became an organ of the anti-imperialist section of the Liberal party. 
Mr A. G. Gardiner became editor in 1902; and in 1904 considerable 
changes were made in the style of the paper, which was reduced in 
price to a halfpenny. The influence of Mr Cadbury, and of the 
group of Quaker families—largely associated with the manufacture 
of cocoa — who followed his example in promoting the publication 
of Liberal and Free Trade newspapers, led in later years to somewhat 
violent attacks from political opponents on the so-called " Cocoa 
Press," with the Daily News at its head. 

The first number of the Daily Telegraph was published on 29th 
June 1855, as a twopenny newspaper. Its proprietor was Colonel 
Sleigh. Thisgentlemansoon found himself in pecuniary „„ .. 
straits, and in satisfaction of the debt for the printing - . * y 
of the paper it was transferred to Mr Joseph Moses Levy \ „ 
in the following September. On 17th September Mr Levy p * 
published it as a four-paged penny journal, the first penny newspaper 
produced in London. His son, afterwards Sir Edward Lawson 
(b. 1833), who was created Baron Burnham in 1904, immediately 
entered the office, and after a short time became editor, a post 
which he only abandoned in 1885, when he became managing 
proprietor and sole director. From the outset Mr Levy gathered 
round him a staff of high literary skill and reputation. Among the 
first were Thornton Hunt, Geoffrey Prowse, George Hooper and Sir 
Edwin Arnold. E. L. Blanchard was among the earliest of the 
dramatic critics, and Alexander Harper the City editor. Later 
there came George Augustus Sala (q.v.) f then one of Charles Dickens's 
young men; Clement Scott (1841-190A), at one time a clerk in the 
War Office ; and Edward Dicey (b. 1832), then fresh from Cambridge. 
The Hon. Frank Lawley turned to journalism from official life; and 
among the most remarkable of the early contributors to the paper 
was J. P. Benjamin, the great Anglo-American lawyer. H. D. 
Traill was a leader-writer for well-nigh a quarter of a century. 
J. M. Le Sage (b. 1837), for many years the managing editor, began 
his connexion with the paper under Mr Levy. Others prominently 
associated with the paper have been W. L. Courtney (b. 1850), 
a distinguished man of letters who, after several years of work as 
tutor at New College, Oxford, joined the staff in I*8oo r and in 1894 
also became editor of the Fortnightly Review ; E. B. Iwan-Mtiller 
(d. 1910) and J. L. Garvin (from 1899), afterwards (1904) editor of 
the Observer. After 1890 Mr H. W. L. Lawson, Lord Burnham's eldest 
son and heir, assisted his father in the general control of the paper. 

The Daily Telegraph may be said to nave led the way in London 
journalism in capturing a large and important reading-public from 
the monopoly of The Times. It became the great organ of the 
middle classes, and was distinguished for its enterprise in many 
fields. In June 1873 the Telegraph despatched George Smith to 
carry out a series of archaeological researches in Nineveh, which 
resulted in the discovery of the missing fragments of the cuneiform 
account of the Deluge, and many other inscriptions. In co-operation 
with the New York Herald it equipped H. M. Stanley's second great 
expedition to Central Africa (1875-1877). Another geographical 
feat with Vnich the name of the Daily Telegraph is associated was 
the exploration of Kilimanjaro (1884-1885) by Mr (afterwards Sir) 
Harry Johnston, whose account of his work appeared in the Daily 
Telegraph during 1885. And Mr Lionel Decle's march from the 
Cape to Cairo, in 1899 and 1900, was also undertaken under the 
auspices of the paper. The Telegraph raised many large funds for 
public purposes. Almost the first was the subscription for the 
relief 01 the sufferers by the cotton famine in Lancashire, in the 
winter of 1862-1863; the fund in aid of thestarvingand impoverished 
people of Paris at the close of the siege in 1871 ; the prince of Wales's 
Hospital Fund in commemoration of the Jubilee of 1897; and the 
Shilling Fund for the soldiers' widows and orphans in connexion 
with the Boer War. An undertaking of a more festive kind was the 
fSte given to 30,000 London school children 4n Hyde Park on the 
occasion of Queen Victoria's Jubilee in 1887. 

In politics the Daily Telegraph was consistently Liberal up to 
1878, when it opposed Mr Gladstone's foreign policy as explained 
in his Midlothian speeches. After 1886 it represented Unionist 
opinions. Among special feats of which it can boast was the first 
news brought to England of the conclusion of peace after the Franco- 
Germati War. 

Prior to 1874 the Daily Telegraph was printed by eight- and ten- 
feeder machines, through which every sheet had to be passed twice 
to complete the impression. Under these conditions it was necessary 
to start printing one side of the paper as early as ten or eleven o'clock. 
The handicap which this imposed on the satisfactory production of 
a newspaper was removed by the introduction of Hoe s web machines 
at the end of 1874. No further change took place until 1891, when 
they were superseded by others built by the same makers capable of 
printing a 12-page paper at the rate of about 24,000 an hour, cut, 
folded, delivered and counted in quires. In 1896 they were modified 
so as to he suitable for turning out an 8-, 10-, 12-, 14- or 16-page 
paper. Up to 1894 the setting of type had been done entirely by 
hand, but in that year the linotype, after an experimental trial, was 
introduced on a large scale. 

The Standard was established as an evening paper in the Tory 
interest (as the express organ of the opponents of the measure for 
removing Roman Catholic disabilities) in 1827, its first 
if* ^ ~* editor being Stanley Lees Giffard, father of the first earl 
Standard. q{ Halsbury ^ who had Alaric W atts and Dr William 

Maginn, famous as one of the originators of Fraser's Magazine, as 
his chief helpers. In the course of two or three years it became a 
pecuniary, as it had from the first been a political, success, and 
gradually ousted the Courier, which was for a time conducted by 
William Mudford, whose son half a century later became the most 
distinguished editor of the Standard. In course of time the latter 
became the property of Mr Charles Baldwin, whose father was 
proprietor of the Morning Herald, and when the father cUed the son 
found himself in possession of both a morning and an eveningjournal. 
In his hands neither of them prospered, although the Standard 
retained a large circulation and constantly printed early and accurate 
political information. At length, midway in the 'fifties, both papers 
were purchased by Mr James Johnstone, Mr John Maxwell, the pub- 
lisher, being for a time associated with him in the ownership. Mr 
Johnstone realized that he had before him a great opportunity, and 
at once set to work to grasp it. Jcie brought out the Standard as a 
morning paper (29th June 1857), increased its size from four to eight 
pages, and reduced the price from fourpence to twopence. One of 
the most curious features of the early numbers was a novel by 
William Howard Russell. The evening edition was continued. In 
February 1858 Mr Johnstone again reduced the price, this time to 
a penny. When that step was taken the Standard announced 
that its polities were " enlightened amelioration and progress," but 
that it was " bound to no party "; and to those independent lines 
it in the main adhered. In the course of four or five years it became 
a financial success, and then began to attract to itself many brilliant 
pens, one of its contributors in the 'sixties, Lord Robert Cecil, 
being destined to become illustrious as marquess of Salisbury. 
Lord Robert was an occasional leader-writer, whose contributions 
were confined almost entirely to political subjects. It was at this 
time that the Standard laid the foundation of the great reputation 
for early and detailed foreign news which it has ever since enjoyed. 
During the American Civil War it obtained the services of a repre- 
sentative signing himself " Manhattan," whose vivid and forcible 
letters from the battlefield arrested attention from the beginning. 
As the campaign progressed, these full, picturesque and accurate 
accounts of the most terrible struggle of modern times were looked 
for with eager interest. There were no " special cables " to discount 
the poignant curiosity ofthe reader, and the paper reached a circu- 
lation far beyond anything hitherto known. The distinction thus 
acquired was^ maintained during the Prussian- Austrian War of 1866, 
and greatly increased by the letters and telegrams describing the 
triumphs and disastersor the campaign of 1870. In the early 'sixties 
the staff had been reinforced by the engagement of Mr William 
Heseltine Mudford. In the midst of his work as a parliamentary 
reporter, he was sent as speciaj correspondent to Jamaica in 1865 
to report upon the troubles which involved the recall of Governor 
Eyre; a further period in the gallery of the House of Commons 
followed, and in 1873 Mr Mudford became business manager. Mr 
Johnstone's first editor was Captain Hamber, who afterwards 
seceded to the short-lived Hour, with whom had been associated 
Mr David Morier Evans as manager. He was succeeded by the 
owner's eldest son, to whom Mr (afterwards Sir) John Gorst was 
joined in a consultative capacity. In 1876 Mr Mudford became 
editor, still, however, retaining managerial control. Mr Johnstone, 
the proprietor to whose energy and perspicacity the paper owed so 
much, died in 1878, and under his will Mr Mudford was appointed 
editor and manager for life, or until resignation. Already a great 
property, the Standard in Mr Mudford's hands entered upon a very 
successful period. He had for his first assistant-editor Mr Gilbert 
Venables, who was succeeded after a short term by Mr George 
Byron Curtis, previously one of the leader-writers, who thus held the 
position through nearly the whole of Mr Mudford's long editorship. 
The staff at this time comprised many men, and some women, 
whose names are distinguished in letters as well as in journalism. 
Mr Alfred Austin, Mr T. H. S. Escott, Miss Frances Power Cobbe 
and Professor Palmer were all writing for the paper at the same time. 
To them must be added, among others, Mr E. D. J. Wilson, the 
brilliant political leader-writer (afterwards of The Times), Mr Percy 
Greg, son of " Cassandra " Greg, Mr T. E. Kebbel and Dr Robert 
Brown, who wrote copiously upon scientific and miscellaneous 
subjects. Foremost among the war correspondents were Mr G. A. 
Henty, who represented the paper on many a stricken field; Mr John 
A. Cameron, who was killed at Abu Klea; and Mr William Maxwell. 
In January 1900 Mr Mudford retired, and was succeeded in the editor- 
ship by Mr G. Byron Curtis (d. 1907), Mr S. H. Jeyes, whose con- 
nexion with the paper had begun in 1891, becoming assistant-editor. 
In November 1904 the Standard, which had at that time taken rather 
a strong line in deprecating the tariff reform movement within the 
Unionist party, was sold to Mr C. Arthur Pearson (proprietor of the 
Daily Express, see below), who was chairman of the Tariff Reform 
League, and considerable changes were made in the paper, Mr H. A. 
Gwynne becoming editor. In 1910 Mr Pearson, owing to ill-health, 
transferred his interests in the proprietary company he had formed 
in 1904 to Mr Davison Dalziel. 

The Daily Chronicle arose, as already mentioned, out of the local 
Clerkenwell News, the latter paper having been purchased by Mr 
Edward Lloyd in 1877, and converted into "an Imperial D .. 
morning paper " on independent Liberal lines. Under JlfJl^t. 
the editorship of Mr R. Whelan Boyle the Daily Chronicle Chronlcle ' 
soon took rank among the other London daily journals, the only 
traces of its original character being showji in the attention paid to 
metropolitan affairs and the appearance of numerous small advertise- 
ments. The independent tone of the journal was conspicuous in its 
treatment of the Home Rule question. At first deprecating the 
system of combined agitation and outrage with which the term was 
synonymous, the Daily Chronicle, under the editorship of Mr A. E. 
Fletcher (1 890-1 895), ceased to be a Unionist journal, and supported 
Mr Gladstone's Bill of 1893. Another instance was afforded in the 
course of the Boer War. During the negotiations and the early 
stages of the campaign, the Daily Chronicle, which was then edited 
by Mr H. W. Massingham (b. i860), strove for peace by supporting 
the Boer side against the diplomacy of Mr Chamberlain. Mr 
Massingham 's policy was, however, not to the liking of the pro- 
prietors, and he retired from the editorship towards the end of 
1899, Mr W. J. Fisher succeeding him as editor. In 1904 Mr Robert 
Donald became editor, and the price was reduced to a halfpenny. 
Mr Massingham during his editorship, ably seconded by Mr (after- 
wards Sir) Henry Norman (b. 1858), had largely increased the interest 
of the paper, particularly on its literary side. A new impetus had 
been given in this direction in 1891, when a " literary page " was 
started, conducted at first by Mr J. A. Manson, and after 1892 by 
Mr Massingham, when he became assistant-editor under Mr Fletcher. 
The Chronicle had taken a leading part in many public movements 
since 1877. It was conspicuous in its advocacy of the cause of the 
men in the London dock strike of 1889; and in the great mining 
dispute for a " living wage," which was brought to a close by Lord 
Rosebery in November 1893, raised over £13,000 for the relief com- 
mittees. Much attention was given to the theosophieal discussion ' 
of 1 89 1 and to the exposure of the adventurer " De Rougemont " 
after he had appeared before the British Association at Bristol in 
1808. The Chronicle took an active part in the negotiations which 
led to the Venezuelan Arbitration Treaty of 1 897; it energetically 
pleaded the cause of the Armenians and Cretans during the massacres 
of 1896, and it encouraged the Greeks in the war with Turkey in 
1897. Its foreign policy was, however, more distinguished by good- 
will than by discretion — and notably in the latter instance. The 
Chronicle also worked strenuously for the Progressive cause in London 
in regard to the County Council, Borough Councils and the School 
Board. Its new successes included the first announcement of the 
revolution in eastern Rumelia (1885); the first circumstantial 
account of the death of Prince Rudolph (1889); Nansen's own 
narrative of his expedition towards the North Pole; Sir Martin 
Conway's journey across Spitzbergen in 1896; and the first ascent 
of Aconcagua in 1897. 

In 1890 the illustrated morning daily paper, the Daily Graphic, 
was founded by W. L. Thomas (1 830-1 901) as an offshoot D .. 
from the weekly illustrated Graphic, and soon came into armphic. 
favour. 

In 1906 a new Liberal morning daily was started by Mr Franklin 
Thomason in the shape of the Tribune, edited by Mr W. Hill, who 
retired after a few months, with Mr L. T. Hobhouse as Tribune 
political editor. Later Mr Pryor became managing 
editor, but at the beginning of 1908, after heavy losses, the publication 
was stopped. 

Two morning papers, at the popular price of halfpenny, appeared 
in the spring of 1892, the Morning and the Morning Leader. They 
raced for priority of publication, the former winning by Ai ern j nT 
a day. The Morning Leader, under the same manage- Lea( f er 
ment as the (evening) Star, continued to flourish, but the 
Morning had but a brief career. 

The halfpenny Daily Mail was originated by Mr Alfred Charles 
Harmsworth (b. 1865), who was subsequently created a baronet 
(1904) and in 1905 a peer as Baron Northcliffe; it appeared DaJ . 

in 1896, on the same day as Sir G. Newnes's penny Courier Ma j£ 
(which only lasted a few weeks). In the evolution of English 
journalism the foundation of the Daily Mail carried still farther the 
work begun by the Daily Telegraph in earlier days. It was the first 
halfpenny morning newspaper to place at the disposal of its readers 
a news service competing with that of any of the higher-priced 
newspapers, and soon took an increasingly important place in the 
Press. At the opening of the 20th century it claimed a regular 
circulation of about a million copies daily ^ (and had occasionally 
sold as many as 1,500,000 copies of a single issue), and it was pro- 
duced simultaneously in London and Manchester, the whole of the 
contents being telegraphed nightly. In May 1904 it began publish- 
ing a continental edition in Paris. The sensational success of the 
Daily Mail, which first made Lord Northcliffe one of the dominant 
personalities in English journalism, was due, not to individual 
writers, but to a consistent policy of catering for a modern public 
and serving them with lively news and articles, and constant change 
of interest. Its large circulation, and resulting advertising revenue, 
gave it an influence which in politics was used on the Unionist side; 
but the readers of the Daily Mail went to it, not for politics, but for 
news, brightly and briefly displayed. Its triumph represented the 
success of a business organization, in which individual views on affairs 
played a comparatively minor part. 

The halfpenny Daily Express, founded by Mr Cyril Arthur Pearson 
(b. 1866) on the lines of the Daily Mail, first appeared in 1900, and 
Dallv soon won a ^ arge cuent ^ e * With R. D. Blumcnfeld as 

Exorcss editor ( fr om 1904) it worked strenuously for Tariff Reform. 
c p * The Daily Mirror, started by Mr Harmsworth as a 
women's penny daily in 1904, failed to attract in its original form 
and was quickly changed into a halfpenny general daily, relying as 
_ „ a novelty on the presentation of news by photographic 

Mlrtor pictures of current events. This new feature soon ob- 
tained for it a large circulation under the enterprising 
management of Mr Kennedy Jones (b. 1865), who was already known 
for his successful conduct of the Evening News and his share in the 
business of the Daily Mail. 

The Globe (founded Jan. 1st., 1803), the oldest of existing London 
evening papers, owed its origin to the desire of the booksellers or 
Globe publishers of the day for an advertising medium, at a 
moment when the Morning Post gave them the cold 
shoulder. A syndicate of publishers started a morning paper, 
the British Press (which had only a short career), to combat the 
Post, and the Globe as a rival to the Courier (see above), which, like 
the Post, was under Daniel Stuart's control. George Lane, previously 
Stuart's chief assistant, was the editor. From 1815 a prominent 
member of the staff was Mr (afterwards vice-chancellor Sir James) 
Bacon. After swallowing up some other journals, in 1823 it absorbed 
the property and title of the Traveller, controlled by Colonel Torrens, 
who in the reorganization became principal proprietor and brought 
over Walter Coulson as the editor. John Wilson succeeded as editor 
in 1834, efficiently seconded by Mr Moran; Thomas Love Peacock 
and R. H. Barham (" Ingoldsby ") being famous contributors 
during his regime. For some time the Globe was the principal Whig 
organ, and Mr (afterwards Deputy Judge Advocate Sir James) 
O'Dowd its political mspirer. Mahony (Father Prout ") was its 
Paris correspondent. In 1842 the Courier was incorporated, but a 
gradual decline in the fortunes of the paper, and Colonel Torrens's 
death in 1864, brought about a reorganization in 1866, when a small 
Conservative syndicate, including Sir Stafford Northcote, bought it 
and converted the Globe into a Conservative organ. In 1868 the 
pink colour since associated with the paper was started. In 1869 
its price (originally sixpence) was lowered to a penny. Mr W. T. 
Madge (b. 1845), whose vigorous management was afterwards so 
valuable, and who in 1881 started with Captain Armstrong the 
People, a popular Sunday journal for the masses, joined the paper 
in 1866; and after brief periods of editorship by Messrs Wcstcomb, 
R. H. Patterson, H. N. Barnett and Marwood Tucker (1868), in 
J871 Captain George C. H. Armstrong (1836-1907), who in 1892 
was created a baronet, was put in control; he edited the paper for 
some years, and then it became his property. The editorial chair 
was filled in succession by Mr Ponsonby Ogle, Mr Algernon Locker 
(1891), and the proprietor's son and heir Lieut. G. E. Armstrong, 
R.N. (1895), until in June 1907, after Sir G. Armstrong's death, the 
paper was sold to Mr Hildebrand Harmsworth. The Globe " Turn- 
overs " (miscellaneous articles, turning over from the first to the 
second page) began in 1871, and became famous for variety and 
humour. The jocular" By the Way "column, another characteristic 
feature, was started in 188 1, and owed much to Mr Kay Robinson 
and Mr C. L. Graves. In the history of the Globe one of the best- 
known incidents is its publication of the Salisbury-Schuvaloff 
treaty of 1878. It was the first London daily to use the linotype 
composing-machine (1892). . . 

A new period of evening journalism, characteristic of the later 
19th century, opened with the founding of the Pall Mall Gazette. 
' .. M n The first number (at twopence) was issued on 7th February 
Gazette. l86s from Salisbury Street, Strand. Mr George Smith, 
of the publishing firm of Smith and Elder, was its first 
proprietor; Mr Frederick Greenwood (q.v.), its first editor, took the 
Anti- Jacobin for his^ model; the paper was intended to realize 
Thackeray's picture (in Pcndennis) of one "written by gentlemen for 
gentlemen." Its political attitude was to be independent, and 
much space was to be given to literature and non-political matter. 
It had brilliant supporters, such as Sir J. Fitzjames Stephen as writer 
of leading articles (replaced to a certain extent, after 1869, by Sir 
Henry Maine), R. H. Hutton, Matthew James Higgins ("Jacob 
Omnium "), James Hannay, and George Henry Lewes, with (Jeorge 
Eliot, Anthony Trollope, Charles Reade, and Thomas Hughes as occa- 
sional contributors; but the paper failed to attract the general public 
until, in the following year, Mr Greenwood's brother, James, furnished 
it with three articles on " A Night in a Workhouse: by an Amateur 
Casual." A morning edition had already been tried and dropped, 
and so was a distinct morning paper attempted in 1870. In 1867 
new premises were taken in Northumberland Street, Strand. Three 
years later the Pall Mall Gazette was the first to announce the sur- 
render of Napoleon III. at Sedan. Matthew Arnold contributed his 
famous " Arminius " letters (" Friendship's Garland ") in 1871, and 
Richard Jefferies contributed " The Gamekeeper at Home " in 1876 
and onwards. Mr Greenwood made the paper unflinchingly Con- 
servative and strongly adherent to Lord Beaconsfield's foreign 
policy. In 1880, however, Mr Smith handed over the Pall Mall 
Gazette to his son-in-law, Mr Henry Yates Thompson, who turned 
it into a Liberal journal. Mr Greenwood then retired from the 
editorship and shortly afterwards started the St James's Gazette ; 
Mr John (afterwards Viscount) Morley became editor of the Pall 
Mall, with Mr W. T. Stead (b. 1849) as assistant-editor. The price 
was reduced in 1882 to one penny. Many of the old contributors 
remained, and they were reinforced by Robert Louis Stevenson, 
who wrote some " Letters from Davos," Professor Tyndall, Professor 
Freeman, James Payn and Mrs Humphry Ward. When Mr Morley 
exchanged journalism for politics in 1883, he was succeeded by Mr 
W. T. Stead [q.v.), with Mr Alfred Milner, afterwards Lord Milner, 
as his assistant. Adopting an adventurous policy, Mr Stead im- 
ported the " interview " from America, and a report of General 
Gordon's opinion was believed to have been the cause of his ill-fated 
mission to, Khartum. A series of articles called " The Truth about 
the Navy " (1884) had considerable influence in causing the Ad- 
miralty to lay down more ships next year. But Mr Stead's career 
as the editor came to an end in 1889, in consequence of his publishing 
a series of articles called "The Maiden Tribute of Modern Babylon," 

Purporting to further the Criminal Law Amendment Bill. Mr 
tead had made a feature of reprints called " extras "; and, edited 
by Mr Charles Morley, the Pail Mall Budget became an illustrated 
weekly. Mr Stead was replaced in 1889 by E. T. Cook, who had 
become assistant-editor in succession to Milner. The Pall Mall 
Gazette was now steadily Liberal and a strong advocate of Irish 
Home Rule. On its staff were Edmund Garrett (a gifted writer who 
became editor of the Cape Times in South Africa, and died pre- 
maturely in 1907), F. C. Gould the caricaturist, and J. Alfred Spender 
(b. 1862). Mr Cook resigned in 1892, on the sale of the paper to Mr 
William Waldorf Astor, the American millionaire, who turned it 
again into a Conservative organ, and also changed its shape, abandon- 
ing the old small pages for a larger sheet; and he and his assistant 
Mr Spender continued the Liberalism of the Pall Mall in the West- 
minster Gazette (see below). Mr Henry Cust, M.P., was appointed 
editor, with Mr E. B. Iwan-Muller as assistant-editor. Mr Cust 
(b. 1 861), who was LordBrownlow's heir, and came fresh to editorship 
with enthusiasms acquired from his experiences in parliament and 
in society, made the columns of the Pall Mall very lively for the 
next couple of years. It became well known "for its " booms," and 
its " smartness " generally. Some papers contributed to it by 
Sir Charles Dilkeand Mr Spenser Wilkinson resulted in the establish- 
ment of the Navy League in 1894. The paper had, too, the first 
news of Mr Gladstone's resignation and the appointment of Lord 
Rosebery to succeed him. But though the Pall Mall under Mr Cust 
had outshone all its competitors, its independence of those business 
considerations which ultimately appeal to most proprietors hardly 
represented a durable state of affairs; and eventually the relations 
between proprietor and editor became strained. In February 1896 
Mr Cust and Mr I wan-M tiller were succeeded respectively by Sir 
Douglas Straight and Mr Lloyd Sanders, the latter of whom retired 
in 1902. Sir Douglas Straight (b. 1844) had been in early days a 
well-known London barrister, and from 1879 to 1892 was a judge in 
India. Sir Douglas Straight remained editor till the end of 1908, 
when he was succeeded by Mr Higginbottom. 

Founded in 1880 by Mr H. Hucks Gibbs (afterwards Lord Aldcn- 
ham), for Mr Frederick Greenwood to edit when he had left the 
Pall Mall, the St James's Gazette represented the more 
intellectual and literary side of Tory journalism in op- 
position to the new Liberalism of Mr Greenwood's former 
organ; it was in fact meant to carry on the idea of the 
original Pall Mall as Mr Greenwood had conceived it, and was 
(like it) more of a daily review than a chronicle of news. In 1888 
the paper having then been sold to Mr E. Steinkopff, Mr Greenwood 
retired and was succeeded as editor (1 888-1 807) by Mr Sidney Low, 
subsequently author of The Governance of England and other able 
works, who had as his chief assistant-editors Mr S. H. J eyes (till 
1 89 1 ), and Mr Hugh Chisholm( 1802-1897), the latter succeeding him as 
editor (1897-1900). In those daysmcre news wasnot considered 
the important feature; or rather, original and sagacious views were 
identified with a sort of novelty such a paper could best promulgate. 
The St James's was for many years conspicuous for its literary 
character, and for the number of distinguished literary men^ who 
wrote for it, some of whom first became known to the public by 
means of its columns. Its interest in newspaper history is really 
that of a paper which appealed to and influenced a comparatively 
small circle of cultured readers,' a " superior " function more and 
more difficult to reconcile with business considerations. It was 
one of the earliest supporters of the Imperialist movement, and 
between 1895 and 1899 was the chief advocate in the Press of 
resistance to the foreign bounties on sugar which were ruining the 
West Indies, thus giving an early impetus to the movement for 
Tariff Reform and Colonial Preference. During the years immedi- 
ately following 1892, when the Pall Mall Gazette again became 
Conservative, the competition between Conservative evening papers 
became acute, because the Globe and Evening Standard were also 
penny Conservative journals; and it was increasingly difficult to 
carry on the St James s on its old lines so as to secure a profit to the 
proprietor; by degrees modifications were made in the general 
character of the paper, with a view to its containing more news 
and less purely literary matter. But it retained its original shape ; 
with sixteen (after 1897, twenty) small pages, a form which the 

	The St James's Gazette, 

Pall Mall abandoned in 1892. Gradually these changes took effect. 
In 1900 Mr Theodore Andrea Cook, who had been assistant-editor 
since 1898, became editor for a brief period, and subsequently Mr 
Ronald MacNeill (till 1903) acted in this capacity, with Mr W. D. 
Ross as manager. Meanwhile the St James s Budget, which up to 
1893 had been a weekly edition of the Gazette, was turned into an 
independent illustrated weekly, edited from the same office by 
Air J. Penderel-Brodhurst (afterwards editor of the Guardian), who 
had been on the editorial staff since 1888; and it -continued to be 
published till 1899. In 1903 the St James's was sold to Mr C. Arthur 
Pearson, who in 1905, having bought the morning Standard, amal- 
gamated the St Jameses with the Evening Standard. 

The Evening Standard had been founded in 1827 (see under the 
Standard above), and when it was amalgamated with 
q rf frf * ^ James's Gazette in 1905, the two titles covered a 
Standard. new paper, in a new form, as the penny Evening Standard 
and St Jameses Gazette, 

When the Pall Mall Gazette was sold to Mr Astor in 1892 and 
converted into a Conservative organ, Mr E. T. Cook, the editor, and 
most of his staff, resigned, and in 1893 they came together 
The West- a g a j n on t he Westminster Gazette, newly started for the 
minster purpose by Sir G. Newnes (who had made a fortune out 
Gazette. Q f fit-bits and other popular papers) as a penny Liberal 
evening paper. It was printed on green paper, but the novelty of 
this soon wore off. The paper was conducted on the lines of the old 
Pall Mall, and it had the advantage of a brilliant political cartoonist 
in F. Carruthers Gould. In 1895 Mr Cook was appointed editor of 
the Daily News, and his place was ably filled by Mr J. Alfred Spender, 
who had been his assistant-editor, Mr Gould (who was knighted in 
1906) being his chief assistant. Apart from Sir F. C. Gould's cartoons, 
the Westminster became conspicuous in London evening journalism 
for its high standard of judicious political and literary criticism. 
It gradually became the chief organ of Liberal thought in London. 
One of its early literary successes was the original publication of 
Mr Anthony Hope's Dolly Dialogues, and it continued to maintain, 
more than any other evening paper, the older literary and political 
tradition of the "gentlemanly journalism" out of which it had 
sprung. In 1908 a change of proprietorship took place, the paper 
being sold by Sir G. Newnes (d. 1910) to Mr (afterwards Sir) Alfred 
Mond, but without affecting the personnel or policy of the paper. 

The first modern English evening newspaper to be issued at a half- 
penny was the London Evening News — afterwards known as the Day. 
It was started in 1855, but soon failed to meet expenses

Even.ng London Echo, published by Henry Cassell. It had for its 
Papers. first e di t0 r, until 1875, Mr (afterwards Sir) Arthur Arnold 
(1833-1902), afterwards M.P. for Salford (1880-1886) and chairman 
of the London County Council (1805-1896), who was well known 
both as a writer and traveller and as founder of the Free Land League 
(1885). Baron Albert Grant (1830-1899), the pioneer of modern 
mammoth company-promoting, 1 afterwards took the Echo in hand 
and wasted a fortune over it; and eventually it was owned for some 
years by Mr Passmore Edwards, coming to an end in 1905. The 
Evening News was begun at a halfpenny in 1881 as a Liberal organ, 
but was shortly afterwards bought by a Conservative syndicate. 
It saw stormy times, and at the end of thirteen years it had absorbed 
£298,000 and was heavily in debt. Its shares could then be purchased 
for threepence or fourpence each. In August 1894 it was purchased 
by Messrs Harmsworth for £25,000, and under Mr Kennedy Jones's 
management developed into a highly successful property. On 17th 
January 1888 the first number of the Star appeared, under the editor- 
ship of M r T. P. O'Connor (b. 1 848) , as a half penny evening newspaper 
in support of Mr. Gladstone's policy. When Mr O'Connor left the 
paper, Mr H. W. Massingham became its editor, and subsequently Mr 
Ernest Parke. In 1909 the Star was acquired by a new proprietor- 
ship in which Messrs Cadbury and the Daily News had an important 
share. From the first it was conspicuous for its advanced attitude 
in politics, and also for excellent literary criticism. In 1893 MrT. P. 
O'Connor founded the Sun, which eventually passed into the hands 
of a succession of proprietors and came to an end in October 1906. 

As regards the purely sporting press in London, Sporting Life, 
„ .. started in 1859, became a daily in 1883, and in 1886 
p0 ns incorporated the old BelVs IJfe. The daily Sportsman, 
a ° f the leading paper, was founded in 1865. The financial

The London weekly press (see also under Periodicals) has always 
worn a motley garb. Weekly publication facilitates the individuality 
of a journal, both as respects its editorship and as respects 
the class of readers to which it more especially addresses 
itself. From the days of Daniel Defoe there have always 
been newspapers bearing the unmistakable impress of an 
individual and powerful mind. Cobbett's Weekly Register 
affords perhaps as striking an illustration of journalism in its great- 
ness and in its meanness as could be found throughout its 
entire annals. And Cobbett's paper has had many successors, 
some of which, profiting by the marvellous mechanical appli- 
ances of the present day, have attained a far wider popular 
influence than was possessed by the Weekly Register in its most 
prosperous days. 

The history of the weekly reviews practically begins with the 
Examiner, which was founded in 1808 and had a long career as one 
of the most prominent organs of the Liberals, ending in 1881. That 
its literary reputation was great resulted naturally from a succession 
of such editors as Leigh Hunt, Albany Fonblanque, John Forster 
and Henry Morley. This was succeeded in January 1817 by the 
foundation of the Literary Gazette, the proprietor of which was Henry 
Colburn and the first editor William Jerdan. Jerdan succeeded in 
inducing Crabbe and Campbell to contribute to it, and among those 
who assisted him were Bulwer Lytton, Barry Cornwall and Mrs 
Hemans. The Literary Gazette came to an end in 1862. At the end 
of 1820 Theodore Hook founded John Bull, which for a time had 
extraordinary popularity; to it he contributed the most brilliant 
of his jeux d'esprit. 

Epochs in the development of this form of literature were marked 
by the foundation of the Athenaeum by James Silk Buckingham in 
January 1828 and by that of the Spectator by Robert Stephen Rintoul 
later in the same year. 

The Spectator was edited for thirty years by Robert RintouL In 
1858 the latter sold the paper to Mr Scott, who retired, however, 
from the editorship after a few months; and for a time the 
Spectator was in low water. In 1861 it passed into the hands 
of R. H. Hutton (q.v.) and Meredith Townsend, and under 
them became a successful exponent of moderate Liberalism 
and thoughtful criticism, particularly in the discussion of 
religious problems, such as were uppermost in the days of the Meta- 
physical Society. The high character and literary reputation of the 
Spectator were already established when, in 1897, it passed into the 
hands of Mr J. St Loe Straehey (b. i860), but under him it became 
a more powerful organ, if only because it more than maintained its 
position while the other weekly papers declined. Unionist in polities 
since 1886, the Spectator after 1903 was the leading organ of FreeTrade 
Unionists who opposed tariff reform, until the progress of socialism 
and the extravagance of Mr Lloyd-George's budget in 1909 caused 
it to accept the full policy of the Unionist party in preference to the 
dangers of socialistic radicalism. No paper in London, it may well 
be said, has earned higher respect than the Spectator , or carried more 
weight in its criticisms, both on polities and on literature. This has 
not been on account of any special brilliance of the pyrotechnic 
order, but because of continuous sobriety and good sense and 
unimpeachable good faith. 

The Saturday Review, on the other hand, is important historically 
rather for the brilliance of its " palmy days." First published on 
the 3rd of November 1855, it was founded by A. J. B. Beresford 
Hope (1820-1887), a brother-in-law of Lord Salisbury, M.P. for 
Maidstone and for Cambridge University, and a prominent church- 
man and art patron ; with John Douglas Cook (1 808-1 868) as editor. 
Mr Hope was the son of James Hope (1770-1831), author of Anas- 
tatius; and it was reputed that Douglas Cook was M Anastatius " 
Hope's natural son. For several years the Saturday maintained an 
exceptional position in London journalism. On the political side 
it was at first Peelite, but the strong ehurehmanship of Mr Beresford 
Hope and antagonism to Mr Gladstone did much to bring it round 
to a pronounced Conservative view. Most, though not all, of its 
early staff had already worked under Mr Cook, when he was editor 
of the Morning Chronicle (from 1848 to 1854). J n lts literary com- 
ment it gave much space to articles of pure criticism and scholarship, 
and almost every writer of contemporary note on the Tory side 
contributed to its columns. But the matter which did most to give 
it its peculiar character was found in its outspoken or even sensational 
" middles " — " The Frisky Matron," " The Girl of the Period " 
(by Mrs Lynn Linton), "The Birch in the Boudoir," &e. The 
editorship remained in the hands of Mr Cook till his death in 1868. 
In 1861 a secession from the Saturday lasting till 1863, led to the 
temporary brilliance of the London Review (1860-1868), started by 
Charles Maekay. Douglas Cook was succeeded by Philip Harwood 
(1809-1887), who had followed him from the Morning Chronicle 
and under whom Mr Andrew Lang became a contributor, with others 
of note. Mr* Harwood retired in 1883, and was succeeded by his 
former assistant Mr Walter Herries Pollock, under whom the paper 
underwent some modifications in form to meet changes in the public 
taste;. Mr G. Saintsbury and Mr H. D. Traill were then prominent 
members of the staff, and Mr Frederick Greenwood wrote for the 
paper till he started the Anti-Jacobin. In 1894 the Saturday Revieto 
was sold by the heirs of Mr Beresford Hope to Mr Lewis Edmunds, 
from whose hands it soon passed to Mr Frank Harris. In 1890. the 
paper was sold to Lord Hardwicke and came under the editorship of 
Mr Harold Hodge, who remained in this position when, after Lord 
Hardwicke's death in 1905, it passed into the hands of Mr Gervase 
Becket. 

The Saturday Review and Spectator, as the exponents of brilliant 
Toryism and serious Liberalism, had the field practically to them- 
selves for some years; but when in 1886 the Spectator followed the 
Liberal Unionists in opposing Home Rule for Ireland, and ceased to 
support Mr Gladstone, the result was the addition to London journal- 
ism of the Radical Speaker (1898); and in 1898 the threepenny 
Outlook (altered in price in 1905 to sixpence) was started, to present 
more particularly the growing interests of the Colonies and < the 
Empire, a side further developed in 1905 and 1906 under the editor- 
ship of Mr J. L. Garvin (b. 1868) in its advocacy of Mr Chamberlain's 
policy of a preferential tariff, when the Spectator became aggressively 
Free Trade. In December 1906 the Outlook was sold by its pro- 
prietor, Mr C. S. Goldman, to Lord Iveagh, and Mr Garvin resigned 
the editorship. In 1907 the Speaker was incorporated with the 
Nation, a new Radical weekly, edited by H. W, Massingham. Several 
ambitious new weeklies meanwhile started, and some passed away 
before the end of the century, such as the Realm, the British Review 
and the Review of the Week. The most brilliant of all these, which 
also lasted the longest, was the Scots (soon renamed the National) 
Observer (1888-1897), edited at first by W. E. Henley (q.v.), and 
subsequently by J. E. Vincent (d. 1909). Mr Henley, assisted by Mr 
Charles Whibley, collected a band of clever young writers, who 
formed almost a " school " of literary journalism, and many of whom 
won their spurs in literature by their contributions to this paper. 
The Pilot (1900) under Mr D. C. Lath bury was another brilliant 
attempt, but it failed to pay its way and hardly lasted for three years. 

Among purely literary weeklies the Atlienaeum found a rival in the 
Academy, founded in October 1869 by Dr Appleton and edited by 
him. Later, under the editorship of J. S. Cotton, it was famous 
for its signed reviews and scholarly character; but the small circle 
to whom pure literature appealed made financial success difficult. 
In 1896 the Academy was bought by Mr Morgan Richards, and for 
some years was edited by Mr Lewis Hind, amalgamating Literature 
(a weekly which had been started by The Times) in 1901; and 
subsequently under changed proprietors it was successively edited 
by Mr Teignmouth Shore and Mr Anderson Graham. In April 
1907 it was bought from Sir G. Newnes by Sir Edward Tennant, 
and subsequently passed under the control of Lord Alfred 
Douglas, who in 1910 parted with it to a new proprietary. 

The publication of Sunday editions of the daily papers has not 
found the same favour in England as in the United States. In 1899 
a Sunday Daily Mail and a Sunday Daily Telegraph 
appeared simultaneously; but public opinion was so 
violent against seven-day journalism that both were 
withdrawn. The oldest of the Sunday papers, the Observer (1791), 
was conducted by one editor, Mr Doxat, for more than fifty years. 
It was one of the first papers to contain illustrations. In later years 
Mr Edward Dicey was a notable editor. In 1905 the Observer passed 
into the hands of Lord Northcliffe, his first editor being Mr Austin 
Harrison, a son of Frederic Harrison. In 1907 Mr J. L. Garvin 
became editor, and under him the old influence of the Observer 
revived. 

Lloyd's Weekly Newspaper started as an unstamped illustrated 
journal at a penny in September 1842. In 1843 it was enlarged in 
size, and the price raised to threepence. Curious ingenuity was shown 
in advertising it by all sorts of expedients. Amongst others, all the 
pennies its proprietor could lay his hands on were embossed, by a 
cleverly constructed machine, with the title and price of the new 
journal. The Times drew attention to this defacement of the coin 
of the realm, and so gave it a better advertisement still. From 
a weekly sale of 33,000 in 1848 it rose to 170,000 in 1861. In antici- 
pation of the abolition of the paper duty, the price was then reduced 
to a penny, and its circulation continued to increase. In later years 
it had an able editor in Mr T. Catling. Reynolds's Weekly Newspaper, 
an extreme Radical paper with a large circulation, dates from May 
1850. Other Sunday papers came later into existence — the People 
(1881), the Sunday (afterwards Weekly) Sun (1891), the Sunday 
Special (1897) — with which in 1904 was amalgamated the Sunday 
Times (1822). The Referee (1877), a paper with a strong sporting 
and theatrical interest, is famous for the humorous contributions by 
" Dagonet " (G. R. Sims) and the pungency of its miscellaneous 
articles. 

Of the London illustrated weekly papers the oldest, the Illustrated 
London News, was founded in 1842; the Graphic in 1869; while the 
„, , « ^ Pictorial World, which lasted for some years, began in 1874. 
Illustrated In ^ Bhck and wMte was started; an d j n ^92 the 
weekly Sketch, edited by Mr Clement Shorter (also then editor of 
papers. the n i ustraUa > L on d on News), introduced a lighter vein. 
Mr Shorter gave up the editorship of these two weeklies in 1901, 
and became editor of a new illustrated weekly, the Sphere, with the 
proprietorship of which came also to be associated the Tatler. 
Another new illustrated weekly of a high class, Country Life Illus- 
trated, began in 1897. 

The " Society " weeklies, Truth (1877), Vanity Fair (1868)— with 

	Sunday papers* 

a separate cartoon as a special feature, famous for the artistic work 
of Pellegrini, Leslie Ward and others — and the World tt Socfetr ,t 
(1874), brought a new " note "into regular journalism, rf otter 
Mr Edmund Yates's success with the World largely con- weeKl j es 
tributing to the increase of the personal style which he 
did so much to introduce; and Truth made its proprietor, the 
politician Mr Henry Labouchere, one of the most prominent men of 
the day, not so much for its aggressive Radicalism as for its vigorous 
exposures of all sorts of public charlatanry. 

Among other weeklies, important ones are such ecclesiastical 
papers as the Guardian (1846), the Record (1828), the Church Times 
(1863), the Tablet (1840), Christian World (1857), Methodist Times 
(1885); the medical papers, the Lancet (1823) and British Medical 
Journal ; the financial papers, the Economist (1843) and Statist 
(1878); and the great sporting and country-house paper, the Field 
< l8 53). ,. , 

Among humorous papers Punch (1840) stands first (see Cari- 
cature,) of which (1895) Mr M. H. Spielmann published ^History; 
Fun ( 1 860-1 901), Mr Harry Furniss's Lika Joko (1894, „ 
only for a few months), Judy (1867), Moonshine (1879) Humorous 
and Pick-me-up (1888), have also catered for popular P a P ers * 
gaiety. 

The introduction of women into English journalism in any large 
degree was one of the new departures of the last quarter of the 19th 
century. It was indeed no new thing for women to write 
for the Press. Harriet Martineau was, in her day, one of the Women 
principal members of the Daily News staff , and M iss Frances Journal' 
Power Cobbe (i822-i905)the advocate of anti-vivisection- IstSt 
ism, was an active journalist. Miss Flora Shaw (Lady Lugard), as 
writer of colonial topics for The Times, or Mrs Crawford, as Paris 
correspondent of the Daily News, are other notable instances of the 
prominence of women's work in the same spheres with the ablest 
men. But such cases as these were exceptional, in which something 
in the nature of a personal mission and a peculiar aptitude gave the 
impulse. Journalism as a profession for women came, however, 
to be widely resorted to, partly through its obvious recommendation 
in a day when women's education required an alternative outlet, 
for those who had to earn their living, to that of the teaching pro- 
fession; partly, and pari passu, through the immense increase in 
women readers and the immensely increased publicity given in news- 
papers to matters of primarily feminine interest. In 1880 the only 
ladies' paper " of any importance was the Queen, a weekly which 
dates from 1861. But subsequently a considerable number of new 
weeklies entered the field: notably the Lady's Pictorial (1880); 
the Lady (1885); Woman (1889); the Gentlewoman (1890), which 
owed its success to the vigorous management of Mr J. S. Wood; 
Madame (1895); and the Ladies 1 Field (1898). New monthlies also 
appeared, in the Englishwoman, the Ladies' Realm and the Woman 
at Home* The sphere of action of the lady journalist was soon 
by no means confined to the " ladies* papers, ' or to the writing 
of columns on dress or cookery for such general journals as found 
it useful to cultivate feminine readers; women invaded every other 
field of journalism, especially the large new field of " interviewing " 
and fashionable gossip. The increase in women-writers generally, 
novelists, dramatists, poets, reacted on their connexion with journal- 
ism; the increased "respectability" of journalism made it easier 
for them to work side by side with men; and gradually nobody 
thought the introduction of women into this sphere anything out of 
the common; a lady journalist, in fact, was much less remarkable 
than a lady doctor. 

British Provincial Press. 
England and Wales. — Though the real development of English 
provincial journalism, as a power co-ordinate with that of London,, 
only dates from the abolition of the stamp duty in 1855, many country 
newspapers before that time had been marked by Hterary ability 
and originality of character. The history of the provincial press of 
England begins in 1690 with the weekly Worcester Postman (now 
Berrow's Worcester Journal). The Stamford Mercury (1695; earliest 
known 1712; long known as Lincoln, Rutland and Stamford Mer- 
cury); Norwich Postman 1 (1706); Nottingham Courant (1710), 
afterwards renamed Journal; Newcastle Courant (171 1); Liverpool 
Courant (17 12; shortlived); Hereford Journal (17 13); Salisbury 
Postman (1715); Bristol Felix Farley's Journal (1715; merged into 
the Bristol Times in 1 735 2 ) ; the Canterbury Kentish Post (1717; 
afterwards Kentish Gazette); Leeds Mercury (17 17); Exeter Mercury, 
Protestant Mercury, and Postmaster or Loyal Mercury (all 1718'); 
York Mercury (17 18), and Manchester Weekly Journal (17 19), came 

	1 The Norwich Postman, a small quarto of meagre contents, was 
	published at a penny, but its proprietor notified that "a halfpenny 
	is not refused ! Within a few years Norwich also had its Courant 
	(1712) and Weekly Mercury or Protestant's Packet (1720). 

	2 Amalgamated with the Bristol Mirror (1773) in 1865 to form the 
	Daily Bristol Times and Mirror. 

	8 Exeter was then fiercely political. These three newspapers 
	commented so freely on proceedings in parliament that their editors 
	were summoned to appear at bar {Journal of the House of Commons, 
	xix. 30, 43, 1718). The incident is curious as showing that each 
	represented a rival MS. news-letter writer in London. 

quickly afterwards ; and other early papers worth mentioning were 
the Salisbury Journal (1729); Manchester Gazette (1730-1760); 
Manchester Mercury (1 762-1 830) ; the earliest Birmingham 
paper, Arts' s Gazette (174O; the Cambridge Chrontcle (1744); 
and the Oxford Journal (1753)* Liverpool also boasted of the 
Liverpool Advertiser (1756) and Gore's General Advertiser (1765- 
1870). Of the above the Leeds Mercury (1717) became an in- 
creasingly important provincial organ. It was originally published 
weekly, and its price was three-halfpence. In 1729 it was reduced 
to four pages of larger size, and sold, with a stamp, at twopence. 
From 1755 to 1766 its publication was suspended, but was resumed 
in January 1767, under the management of James Bowlev, who 
continued to conduct it for twenty-seven years, and raised it to a 
circulation of 3000. Its price at this time was fourpence. The 
increase of the stamp duty in 1797 altered its price to sixpence, 
and the circulation sank from 3000 to 800. It was purchased in 
1801 by Edward Baines, who first began the insertion of" leaders," 
and whose family left an impress not only on journalism but on 
literature in the North of England. It took him three years to 
obtain a circulation of 1500; but the Mercury afterwards made 
rapid progress. When the Stamp Tax was removed, its price was 
reduced to a penny, and in 1901 to a halfpenny. For many years it 
admitted neither racing nor theatrical new to its columns, and it 
had a powerful moral and political influence in Lancashire and 
Yorkshire. 

The abolition of the duty on advertisements in 1853, of the 
stamp duty in 1855, and of the paper duty in 1861, opened the way 
for a cheap press, and within ten years of the abolition of the paper 
duty penny morning newspapers had taken up commanding posi- 
tions in Edinburgh, Glasgow, Dundee and Aberdeen; in Liver- 
pool, Manchester, Leeds, Bradford, Newcastle and Sheffield; in 
Birmingham and Nottingham; in Bristol, Cardiff and Plymouth; 
and across St George's Channel in Dublin, Cork, Belfast and Water- 
ford. As time went on, and increasingly after the 'seventies, pro- 
vincial evening papers began to multiply. But any real importance 
as organs of opinion was still confined to only a few of the great penny 
provincial dailies, notably the Yorkshire Post, Manchester Guardian, 
Birmingham Post (1857), Sheffield Telegraph (associated with Sir 
W. Leng), Liverpool Datly Post, Leeds Mercury and Western Morning 
News; others too numerous to mention here were at the same time 
cradling journalists who were to become famous in a larger sphere, 
such as the Darlington Northern Echo, on which Mr W. T. Stead made 
his debut, while Mr Joseph Cowen for some years made the Newcastle 
Daily Chronicle a powerful force. 

The provincial journals began as strictly local organs. But even 
in 1870 it was beginning to be universally perceived that, though the 
influence of a newspaper depends upon the sagacity, sound judgment 
and courage of the editor, its success as a business enterprise rests 
mainly with the business manager. Managers demanded less local- 
ism, a wider range of news, prompter and fuller reports pi all im- 
portant events, longer parliamentary reports, parliamentary 
sketches, verbatim reports of speeches by statesmen of the first rank. 
In the early 'seventies such a thing as a full telegraphic report in a 
provincial morning newspaper of parliamentary proceedings, or of 
a speech by a leading statesman, was almost unheard of. The Press 
Association had been in existence a short time, but had not then 
covered the country with its organization. Reuter's foreign news 
service very briefly reported important events. Leading articles were 
written during the day. Between 1870 and 1880 a complete revolu- 
tion was effected, as the result of the social and educational changes. 
Leader-writers began to discuss the latest topics. Newspapers that 
had been content to fill their columns with local news and clippings 
from London and distant provincial papers put such matter aside. 
Telegraphic news crushed it out. In February 1870 the govern- 
ment took over the telegraph system. The advantage of the change 
was immediately felt by newspapers and their readers. Leading 
English and Irish newspapers, following Scotland's lead, began to 
open offices in London, where Fleet Street soon began to be an open 
directory to the provincial press — English, Scottish and Irish. The 
Scottish and the leading Irish newspapers of necessity, the wealthiest 
and most enterprising English papers for convenience and advantage, 
engaged special wires. Others that were near enough to London to 
do so secured London news and advertisements by railway, and 
completed their news supply by a liberal use of the telegraph. 
Commercial news, both home and foreign, especially American, was 
expanded. The Press Association spread its news-collecting organ- 
ization over the whole country, and was stimulated to activity by the 
rising opposition of the Central News. All this energy had its 
counterpart in the business side of the press. Rapid " perfecting " 
printing machines were introduced, and newspaper managers found 
themselves iri possession of newspapers full of the latest news, and 
procurable t in practically unlimited quantities. By the use of 
special trains and other organizations, circulation increased apace. 
The development of news agencies, and their universal employment, 
tended to produce sameness in the provincial press. From this fate 
the more enterprising journals saved themselves by special London 
letters, parliamentary sketches .and other special contributions. 
In 1 88 1 the reporters gallery in the House of Commons was opened 
to some provincial newspapers, and these accordingly enjoyed new 
facilities for special effort and distinction. A more important matter, 
however, was the bombardment of Alexandria and the subsequent 
Egyptian War. The leading provincial newspapers had already 
emancipated themselves from localism, and in general news and 
criticism had risen almost, if not quite, to the average level of the 
first-class London journals. Now they were to step abroad into the 
field of war. Singly or in syndicates, or by arrangement with London 
journals, the leading provincial newspapers sent out war corre- 
spondents, and were able to record the history of events as promptly 
and fully as the metropolitan press. The first syndicate to send cut 
war correspondents was formed by the Glasgow News, the Liverpool 
Daily Post, Manchester Courier, Birmingham Gazette and Western 
Morning News, who despatched two correspondents to Egypt, and 
the new departure was attended with complete success. The 
Central News also sent out war correspondents to Egypt and the 
Sudan. During the South African War (1899-1902) the Press 
Association, in conjunction with Reuter's Agency, employed corre- 
spondents, as well as the Central News. The leading provincial 
newspapers, however, all formed syndicates amongst themselves to 
secure war telegrams, and in many cases made arrangements for the 
simultaneous publication of the letters and telegrams of leading 
London journals. This system of securing simultaneous publication, 
in provincial newspapers, of special contributions to London morning 
newspapers was afterwards still further extended, and articles of 
exceptional interest that have been specially prepared for London 
journals may now be found on the same day in some of the leading 
provincial newspapers. 

By the beginning of 1880 the country had fallen upon a period of 
low prices, and extra expenditure upon war telegrams and on an 
improved supply of general news was to a considerable extent 
balanced by the reduced cost of paper. A list compiled at the com- 
mencement of 1902 gave the names of eighty-seven halfpenny daily 
newspapers published in English provincial towns, a considerable 
number of these being morning journals. Of these, sixty-two had 
been issued since 1870, those bearing earlier dates of origin being in 
most cases sheets which formerly were issued at a penny or more, 
but had subsequently reduced their prices. Of the sixty-two that 
were issued since 1870, twenty-seven appeared between 1871 and 
1882, nineteen between 1882 and 1892 and sixteen between 1892 
and 1902. Under the stimulus of cheapness the news-sheet was 
enlarged. More advertisements, more news, more varied contri- 
butions, filled up the additional space. The cost of composition 
increased, and, though circulation and revenue increased also, there 
was some danger to the margin of profit. Again invention came to 
the rescue. I n the 'eighties some of the leading provincial newspapers 
began to use type-setting machines. In this forward step the 
provinces were farahead ofthe London papers, excepting The Times. 
The Southport Daily News — since dead — led the way by introducing 
six Hattersley machines, and soon afterwards type-setting machinery 
became the rule in the provincial press. In the development of 
provincial papers, one factor of special importance must be noted, 
the desire for news about all branches of sport. In 1870 sporting 
meant horse-racing and little more. By degrees it embraced 
athleticism in all its branches, and progressive newspapers were 
looked to for information on football, hockey, golf, cricket, lawn- 
tennis, yachting, boating, cycling, wrestling, coursing, hunting, polo, 
running, bowls, billiards, chess, &c, quite as much as for notices of 
musical and dramatic performances, and of other forms of recreation 
and amusement. The ordinary provincial press, and itS t halfpenny 
evening representatives, largely depend on the attraction of the 
sporting news; and a number of special local papers have also been 
started to cater for this public. 

Scotland. — The first newspaper purporting by its title to be 
Scottish (the Scotch Intelligencer, 1 7th September 1643) and the first 
newspapers actually printed in Scotland (Mercurius Criticus and 
Mercurtus Politicus, published at Leith in 165 1 and 1653) were of 
English manufacture — the first being intended to communicate 
more particularly the affairs of Scotland to the Londoners, the 
others to keep Cromwell's army well acquainted with the London 
news. The reprinting of the Politicus was transferred to Edinburgh 
in November 1654, and it continued to appear (under the altered 
title Mercurius Publicus subsequently to April 1660) until the 
beginning of 1663. Meanwhile an attempt by Thomas Sydserfe to 
establish a feally Scottish newspaper, Mercurius Caledonius, had 
failed after the appearance of ten numbers, the first of which had 
been published at Edinburgh on the 8th of January 1660. It was 
not until March 1699 that a Scottish newspaper was firmly estab- 
lished, under the title of the Edinburgh Gazette, by James Watson, 
a printer of eminent skill in his art. 2 Before the close of the 

	1 This was followed by the Scotch Dove, the first number of which 
	is dated " September 30 to October 20, 1643," and by the Scottish 
	Mercury (No. 1, October 5, 1643). In 1648 a Mercurius Scoticus and 
	a Mercurius Caledonius were published in London. The Scotch Dove 
	was the only one of these which attained a lengthened existence. 

	2 Watson was the printer and editor, but the person licensed was 

James Donaldson, merchant in Edinburgh (" Act in favors of 
ames Donaldson for printing the Gazette" March 10,1699, published 
in Miscellany of the Maitland Club, ii. 232 sq.). Arnot, in his History 
of Edinburgh, mentions as the second of Edinburgh newspapers — 
intervening between Mercurius Caledonius and the Gazette — a 
year the Gazette was transferred to John Reid, by whose family it 
long continued to be printed. In February 1705 Watson started the 
Edinburgh Courant, of which he only published fifty-five numbers. 
He states it to be his plan to give " most of the remarkable foreign 
news from their prints, and also the home news from the ports of this 
kingdom . . . now altogether neglected." The Courant appeared 
thrice a week. Upon complaint being made to the privy council 
concerning an advertisement inserted after the transfer of the paper 
to Adam Boig, the new printer presented a supplication to the 
council in which he expressed his willingness " that in all time 
coming no inland news or advertisements shall be put into the 
Courant, but at the sight and allowance of the clerks of council." 
In 1710 the town council authorized Mr Daniel Defoe to print the 
Edinburgh Courant in the place of the deceased Adam Boig. Four 
years earlier (1706) the indefatigable pioneer of the Scottish press, 
James Watson, had begun the Scots Courant, which he continued to 
print until after the year 17 18. To these papers were added in 
October 1708 the Edinburgh Flying Post and in August 1709 the 
Scots 'Postman^ Five years later this paper appears to have been 
incorporated with the Edinburgh Gazette. The Caledonian Mercury 
began April 28, 1720. At one period it was published thrice and 
afterwards twice a week. Its first proprietor was William Rolland, 
an advocate, and its first editor Thomas Ruddiman. The property 
passed to Ruddiman on Rolland's death in 1729, and remained in his 
family until 1772. It is curious to notice that in his initiatory 
number of April 1720, Rolland claimed a right to identify his 
Mercury with that of 1660. This journal, he said in his preface to the 
public, " is the oldest [existing] in Great Britain." And his successor 
of the year i860 followed suit by celebrating the " second centenary " 
of the Caledonian Mercury. He brought out a facsimile of No. 1 of 
Mercurius Caledonius (January 1660), in its eight pages of small 
quarto, curiously contrasting with the great double sheet of the day. 
But sixty years is a long period of suspended animation, and the 
connexion of the two newspapers cannot be proved to be more than 
nominal. The Caledonian Mercury was the first of Scottish journals 
to give conspicuous place to literature — foreign as well as Scottish. 
In " the *45 ' one of its editors, Thomas Ruddiman, junior, virtually 
sacrificed his life, 1 and the other, James Grant, went into exile, for 
the expression of conscientious political opinion. Its publication 
ceased after an existence of more than one hundred and forty 
years. 

Notwithstanding the positive assertion 2 that the Edinburgh 
Courant and the Edinburgh Evening Courant " were entirely different 
journals, and never had any connexion whatever with each other," 
a substantial identity may be asserted upon better grounds than 
those for which identity used to be claimed for the Caledonian 
Mercury with Mercurius Caledonius. The grant by the town council 
of Edinburgh in December 1718 of a licence to James M'Ewan to 
print an Evening^ Courant three times a week appears to have been 
really a revival, in altered form, of the original Courant, repeatedly 
referred to in earlier, but not much earlier, records of the same 
corporation. So revived, the Evening Courant was the first Scottish 
paper to give foreign intelligence from original sources, instead of 
repeating the advices sent to London. In 1780 David Ramsay 
became its proprietor. Under his management it is said to have 
attained the largest Scottish circulation of its day. It was then of 
neutral politics. Subsequently, returning to its original title, and 
appearing as a daily morning paper, it ranked for long as the senior 
organ of the Conservative party in Scotland, but at last the compe- 
tition of the Scotsman caused its disappearance, and after amalgamat- 
ing with the Glasgow News or the Scottish News in 1886, it expired in 
1888. 

The Edinburgh Weekly Journal began in 174A, but it only attained 
celebrity when, almost seventy years afterwaras, it became the joint 
property of Sir Walter Scott and of James Ballantyne. Scott wrote 
in its columns many characteristic articles, Ballantyne edited it 
until his death in 1833, and was succeeded in the editorship by 
Thomas Moir. The paper was discontinued about 1840. The 
Edinburgh Evening News started in 1873. 

The Scotsman, the leading Scottish newspaper, was established 
as a twice-a-week paper in January 181 7 and became a daily in June 
1855. It ranked as the chief organ of the Liberal party in Scotland, 
until the Home Rule split in 1886, when it became Unionist. It was 
founded by William Ratchie, in conjunction with Charles Maclaren. 
For a short period it was edited by J. R. M'Culloch, the eminent 
political economist. He was succeeded by Maclaren, who edited the 
paper until 1845, and he in turn in i8a8 by Alexander Russel (1814- 
1876), who (with Mr Law as manager) continued to conduct it with 

Kingdom's Intelligencer. But this was a London newspaper, dating 
from 1662, which may occasionally have been reprinted in Scotland; 
no such copies, however, are now known to exist. In like manner 
the Scottish Mercury, No. 1, May 8, 1692, appears to have been a 
London newspaper based upon Scottish news-letters, although in an 
article written in 1848, in the Scottish Journal of Topography, vol. ii. 
P* 3<>3, it is mentioned as an Edinburgh newspaper.

great ability until 1876. In 1859 the first of Hoe's rotary machines 
brought into Scotland was erected for the Scotsman. The Scotsman 
soon developed into a great newspaper, strong both on its literary 
side and also in gathering news; and it was circulated all over 
Scotland, its publishing offices being opened in Glasgow, which was 
a better centre for distributing in the west, and in Perth for the 
north. At last under Charles A. Cooper it succeeded in killing all 
its rivals in Edinburgh. In 1885 the Scotsman issued an evening 
paper. 

The North British Advertiser was founded in 1826. The Witness 
began in 1840 as the avowed organ of what speedily became the 
Free Church party in Scotland. In its first prospectus it calls itself 
the Old Whig. The paper appeared twice a week, and its editor, Hugh 
Miller, very soon made it famous. In the course of less than sixteen 
years he wrote about a thousand articles and papers, conspicuous for 
literary ability, still more so for a wide range of acquirement and of 
original thought, most of all for deep conscientiousness. It survived 
its first editor's death (1855) only a few years. 

In Glasgow the Glasgow Herald was founded in 1782. When the 
Scotsman extended its activities to Glasgow, the Herald opened an 
office in Edinburgh; and it took an active part in breaking down 
the old localism, of Scottish papers. In later years it became a 
powerful organ. The North British Daily Mail was established in 
April 1847. George Troup, its first editor, made it specially famous 
for the organizing skill with which he brought his intelligence at an 
unprecedented rate of speed from Carlisle, the nearest point then 
connected with London by railway.* The Glasgow Evening News 
was started in 1870. 

The Aberdeen Journal was founded as a weekly paper in 1748 and 
became a daily in 1876. In 1879 it issued an evening edition. The 
Aberdeen Daily Free Press, originally a weekly, dates from 1853. 
In 1881 it issued an evening paper in connexion with itself. The 
Dundee Advertiser, established in 1801, towards the latter part of the 
century extended its sphere of influence much on the lines of the 
Scotsman and Glasgow Herald. It issued the Evening Telegraph in 
1877. In 1859 the Dundee Courier, a halfpenny paper, had begun. 

It may be added that a very large number of the men who have 
distinguished themselves by their labours on the great newspapers 
of London, and several who rank as founders of these, began tneir 
career and have left their mark on the newspapers of Scotland. 

Ireland. — In 1641 appeared a sheet called Warranted Tidings from 
Ireland, but this, with Ireland's True Diurnal (1642), Mercurius 
Hibernicus (1644), the Irish Courant (1600), were all of them London 
newspapers containing Irish news. The real newspaper press of 
Ireland began with the Dublin News-Letter of 1685. Five years later 
appeared the Dublin Intelligencer (No. 1, September 30, 1690). 
Both of these were shortlived. Pue's Occurrences followed in 1700 
and lasted for more than fifty years, as the pioneer of the daily 
press of Ireland. In 1710 or in 1711 (there is some doubt as to the 
date of the earliest number) the Dublin Gazette began to appear, 
the official organ of the vice-regal government. Falkener's Journal 
was established in 1728. Esdaile's News-Letter began in 1744, took 
the title of Saunders's News-Letter in 1 754 (when it appeared three 
times a week), and became a daily newspaper in 1777. 

In the Nationalist press the famous Freeman's Journal has long 
been prominent amongst the Dublin papers. It was established 
as a daily paper by a committee of the first society of "United 
Irishmen " in 1763, and its first editor was Dr Lucas. Flood and 
Grattan were at one time numbered amongst its contributors, 
although the latter, at a subsequent period, is reported to have 
exclaimed in his place in the Irish parliament, " The Freeman's 
Journal is a liar ... a public, pitiful liar." In 1870 it brought out 
the Evening Telegraph. In 1891 the dissensions among the Irish 
Nationalists led to the establishment of the Parnellite Dublin Daily 
Independent and Evening Herald. In 1897 the Nation, formerly a 
weekly, was brought out as a daily. On the Unionist side the 
principal Irish paper is the Dublin Irish Times (1859). 

Waterford possessed a newspaper as early as 1729, entitled the 
Waterford Flying Post. It professed to contain " the most material 
news both foreign and domestic," was printed on common writing 
paper and published twice a week at the price of a halfpenny. The 
Waterford Chronicle was started in 1766. 

The Belfast News-Letter was started in 1737; the Belfast Evening 
Telegraph in 1870; the Belfast Northern Whig in 1824. 

British Dominions beyond the Sea. 

It is unnecessary here to give all the statistics for the British 
Colonial press, which has enormously developed in modern times. 
So far as its early history is concerned, it may be noted that Keimer's 
Gazette was started in Barbadoes in 1731 and Granada followed with 
a newspaper of its own in 1742. In Canada the Halifax Gazette was 
established in 1751 and the Montreal Gazette in 1765. The first 
Australasian paper was the Sydney Gazette and New South Wales 
Advertiser (1 803-1843), the Derwent Star, in Van Dieman's Land 
(Tasmania), starting in 1810. In modern days all the British 
dominions beyond the sea have produced important and well-con- 
ducted papers. The Canadian press has naturally had certain 
marked affinities with the American; but the Globe in Toronto, as 

	8 See Notes and Queries, 5th series, vii. 45, viii. 205. 

the organ of the Liberal party, has played a leading part in Canadian 
history. In Australia the Sydney Bulletin, the Sydney Morning 
Herald (1831— <laily since 1840), Sydney Daily Telegraph, Melbourne 
Argus (1846) and Melbourne Age (1854), with the evening Melbourne 
Herald, have been the most important. In South Africa the Cape 
Times (1876) has been the principal paper, but some of the Transvaal 
English papers have exercised great influence in the disturbed 
political conditions since about 1895. 

India, — For a considerable period under the rule of the East India 
Company the Indian press was very unimportant both in character 
and influence. It was permitted to shape its course and to gain 
a position as it could, under the potent checks of the deportation 
power and the libel law, without any direct censorship. Nor was it 
found difficult to inflict exemplary punishment on the writers of 
" offensive paragraphs." 

Prior to Lord Wellesley's administration the most considerable 
newspapers published at Calcutta were the World, the Bengal Journal, 
the Hurkaru, the Calcutta Gazette (the organ of the Bengal govern- 
ment), the Telegraph, the Calcutta Courier, the Asiatic Mirror and 
the Indian Gazette. Mr Duane, the editor of the World, was sent to 
Europe in 1794 for " an inflammatory address to the army," as was 
Mr Charles Maclean, four years afterwards for animadverting in 
the Telegraph on the official conduct of a local magistrate. 

The Calcutta Englishman dates from 1821. Lord Wellesley was the 
first governor-general who created a censorship (April 1799). His 
press-code was abolished b^ the marquis of Hastings in 1818. The 
power of transporting obnoxious editors to Europe of course remained. 
Perhaps the most conspicuous instance of its exercise was the re- 
moval of the editor of the Calcutta Journal (Silk Buckingham), 
which occurred immediately after Lord Hastings's departure from 
India and during the government of his temporary successor, Mr 
John Adan. Buckingham's departure was followed closely (14th 
March 1823) by a new licensing act, far exceeding in stringency that 
of Lord Wellesley, and (5th April 1823) by an elaborate " Regulation 
for preventing the Establishment of Printing-Presses without Licence, 
and for restraining under certain circumstances the Circulation of 
Printed Books and Papers." The first application of it was to 
suppress the Calcutta Journal. 

In the course of the elaborate inquiry into the administration of 
India which occupied both Houses of Parliament in 1832, prior 
to the renewal of the Company's charter, it was stated that there 
were, besides 5 native journals, 6 European newspapers: three 
daily, the Bengal t Hurkaru, John Bull and the Indian Gazette; 
one published twice a week, the Government Gazette; and two 
weekly the Bengal Herald and the Oriental Observer. At this 
period every paper was published under a licence, revocable at 
pleasure, with or without previous inquiry or notice. At Madras, 
on the other hand, the press remained under rigid restriction. The 
Madras censorship was removed whilst the parliamentary inquiry of 
1832 was still pending. 

One question only, and that but for a brief interval, disturbed 
Lord William Bentinck's love of free discussion. The too famous 
" Half-Batta " measure led him to think that a resolute persistence 
in an unwise policy by the home government against the known 
convictions of the men actually at the helm in India and an un- 
fettered press were two things that could scarcely co-exist. It was 
on this occasion that Sir Charles Metcalfe recorded his minute 
of September 1830, the reasoning of which fully justifies the assertion 
— " I have, for my own part, always advocated the liberty of the 
press, believing its benefits to outweigh its mischiefs; and I continue 
of the same opinion." This opinion was amply carried out in the 
memorable law (drafted by Macaulay and enacted by Metcalfe as 
governor-general in 1835), which totally abrogated the licensing 
system. It left all men at liberty to express their sentiments on 
public affairs, under the legal and moral responsibilities of ordinary 
life, and remained in force until the outbreak of the mutiny of 
1857. _ 

In 1853 Garcin de^Tassy, when opening at Paris his annual course 
of lectures on the Hindustani language, enumerated and gave some 
interesting details concerning twenty-seven journals (of all sorts) in 
Hindustani. In i860 he made mention of seventeen additional ones. 
Of course the circulation and the literary merits of all of them were 
relatively small. One, however, he said, had reached a sale of 
4000 copies. 1 

In 1857 Lord Canning's law, like that of 1823, on which it was 
closely modelled, absolutely prohibited the keeping or using of 
printing-presses, types or other materials for printing, in any part 
of the territories in the possession and under the government of 
the East Indian Company, except with the previous sanction and 
licence of government, and also gave full powers for the seizure and 
prohibition from circulation of all books and papers, whether 
printed within the Indian territories or elsewhere. 

In 1878 an act was passed, which long remained in force, regulating 
the vernacular press of India: " Printers or publishers of journals in 
Oriental languages must, upon demand by the due officer, give bond 
not to p rint or publish in such newspapers anything likely to excite 

	1 The Hurkaru and the Indian Gazette were long afterwards com- 
	bined under the new leading title, Indian Daily News (with the old 
	name appended). 

feelings of disaffection to the government or antipathy between 
persons of different castes or religions, or for purposes of extortion. 
Notification of warning is to be made in the official gazette if these 
regulations be infringed (whether there be bond or not) ; on repeti- 
tion, a warrant is to issue for seizure of plant, &c; if a deposit have 
been made, forfeiture is to ensue. Provision is made not to exact 
a deposit if there be an agreement to submit to a government officer 
proofs before publication." After the disturbances of 1908-1909/ 
further and more stringent regulations were made. 

The Indian Daily Mirror (1 863) was the first Indian daily in English 
edited by natives. The total number of journals of all kinds pub- 
lished^ within all the territories of British India was reported by the 
American consular staff in 1882 as 373, with an estimated average 
a gg re gate circulation per issue of 288,300 copies. Of these, 43, with 
an aggregate circulation of 56,650 copies, were published in Cal- 
cutta; 60, with an aggregate circulation of 51,776 copies, at Bombay. 
In 1900 it appeared from the official tables that there were about 
600 newspapers, so called, published in the Indian empire, of which 
about one-third, mostly dailies, were in the Indian vernaculars. 
Calcutta had 15 dailies (Calcutta Englishman, &c); Bombay 2 
(Bombay Gazette) ; Madras 4 (Madras Mail) ; Rangoon 3 (Rangoon 
Times); Allahabad 2 (Pioneer); Lahore 2 (Civil and Military 
Gazette).

Massachusetts. — Boston was the first city of America that 
possessed a local newspaper; but the earliest attempt in that 
direction, made in 1689, and a second attempt, under the title 
Publick Occurrences, which followed in September 1690, were 
both suppressed by the government of Massachusetts. Nearly 
fourteen years afterwards (April 24, 1704), the first number of 
the Boston News-Letler was " printed by B. Green, and sold by 
Nicholas Boone." Its proprietor and editor — so far as it can be 
said to have had an editor, for extracts from the London papers 
were its staple contents — was John Campbell, postmaster of the 
town. In 1719 he enlarged his paper, in order, as he told his 
readers, " to make the news newer and more acceptable; . . . 
whereby that which seem'd old in the former half-sheets becomes 
new now by the sheet. . . . This time twelvemonth we were 
thirteen months behind with the foreign news beyond Great 
Britain, 3 and now less than five months; so that ... we have 
retrieved about eight months since January last "; and he 
encourages his subscribers with the assurance that if they will 
continue steady " until January next, life permitted, they will 
be accommodated with all the news of Europe . . . that are 
needful to be known in these parts." But Campbell's new plans 
were soon disturbed by the loss of his office, and the commence- 
ment of a new journal by his successor in the postmastership, 
William Brooker, entitled the Boston Gazette " published by 
authority" (No. 1, 21st December 1719). The old journalist 
had a bitter controversy with his rival, but at the end of the year 
1722 relinquished his concern in the paper to Benjamin Green, 
who carried it on, with highei aims and greater success, until his 
death, at the close of 1733, being then succeeded by his son-in- 
law, John Draper, who published it until December 1762. By 
Richard Draper, who followed his father, the title was altered 
to Massachusetts Gazette and Boston News-Letter; and the 
maintenance of the British rule against the rising spirit of 
independence uniformly characterized his editorship and that 
of his widow (to whom, at a subsequent period, a pension was

granted by the British government). It was the only paper 
printed in Boston during the siege, and ceased to appear when the 
British troops were compelled to evacuate the city. 

The Boston Gazette, founded in 17 19, had James Franklin, 
elder brother of the celebrated Benjamin Franklin, as its first 
printer. It lasted until the end of 1754, its editorship usually 
changing with the change of the postmasters. On the 17 th 
August 1 721 James Franklin started the New England Courant, 
the publication of which ceased in 1727; and two years later 
Benjamin Franklin purchased the Pennsylvania Gazette, which 
he continued weekly until 1765. 

To the Boston Gazette and the Courant succeeded the New 
England Weekly Journal (20th March 1727; incorporated with 
the Boston Gazette in 1741), and the Weekly Rehearsal (27th 
September 1731), which became the Boston Evening Post (August 
1735), and under that title was for a time the most popular of the 
Boston newspapers. It aimed at neutrality in politics, and there- 
fore did not survive the exciting events of the spring of 1775. 
Several minor papers followed, which may be passed over without 
notice, A new Boston Gazette, which began in April 1 755 (merged 
in 1836 in the Centinel), is of more interest. For a long time it 
was the main organ of the popular party against England, and 
expounded their policy with great ability, and in a dignified 
temper. Otis, John Adams, Samuel Adams and Joseph Warren 
were amongst its writers. It was strongly Republican after the 
adoption of the constitution, especially opposing its old con- 
tributor John Adams. 

The Massachusetts Spy (1770), under the indefatigable editor- 
ship of the American historian of printing, Isaiah Thomas, 
did yeoman's service in this struggle, although of a different 
kind fiom that of the Boston Gazette, The latter spoke chiefly 
to the thinkers and natural leaders of the. people. The Spy was 
a light and active skirmisher who engaged his antagonists 
wherever he met them, and frequently carried the war into the 
enemy's country. In July 1774, during the operation of the 
Boston Port Act, and soon after the landing of four British 
regiments, it adopted Franklin's odd device, representing Great 
Britain as a dragon, and the colonies as a snake divided into 
nine parts with the motto, " join or die." But Boston grew too 
hot for the patriotic printer, and he had to remove to Worcester 
on the day of the battle of Lexington. Here the paper continued 
to be published (as the Worcester Spy) until 1786, — the lack of the 
stirring revolutionary matter being occasionally supplied by the 
republi cation in its columns of entire books, such as Robertson's 
America and Gordon's History of the Revolution. This journal, 
like so many more, was for a time killed by a tax. The stamp 
duty imposed in March 1786, though amounting to but two- 
thirds of a penny, and very speedily repealed, led to its suspension 
until April 1788, when the weekly Massachusetts Spy was revived, 
lasting till 1848. A morning edition, the Worcester Spy, was 
started in 1845 and continued to be published till May 1004. 

The Boston Centinel was another memorable newspaper. It 
was founded in 1784 as the Massachusetts Centhiel and the 
Republican Journal, a semi-weekly ; in 1 790 becoming the 
Columbian Centinel. For many years it was edited by Major 
B. Russell (1 761-1845), a man who combined real ability with 
moderation of temper and singular modesty and disinterested- 
ness. He printed the Acts of Congress for a very long time 
without charge, but the government eventually gave him £1400 
in recognition of his work. The Centind had good foreign news, 
and Russell was intimate with Louis Philippe and Talleyrand 
when they were in Boston. In 1830 it absorbed the Palladium 
(founded in 1793 as the Massachusetts Mercury, and renamed 
in 1 80 1 the Massachusetts Mercury and New England Palladium), 
and in 1836 the Boston Gazette, but in 1840 was merged in the 
Boston Advertiser. The Boston Daily Advertiser was founded in 
18 13, and in 1832 absorbed the Patriot, which in 1819 was started 
out of a nucleus chiefly composed of the New England Chronicle 
(i776). 

William Lloyd Garrison's once well-known Liberator was 
founded at Boston on New Year's Day 1831. For a time its 
editor was also writer, compositor and pressman. In December 
of that year the legislature of Georgia offered a reward of 5000 
dollars to any one who would cause him to be apprehended and 
brought to trial. He continued the paper till 1865 and lived to 
witness the abolition of negro slavery. In 1827 Garrison also 
edited in Boston the National Philanthropist, the first American 
total abstinence paper. 

Among modern Boston papers the most important arc the 
Evening Transcript (1830), Herald (1836), Daily Advertiser (1813), 
Globe (1872), Boston American (1904) and Post (1831). 

Of Massachusetts papers outside Boston the most important 
still in existence in 1910 was the morning Springfield Republican 
(weekly, 1824; daily, 1844), established by Samuel Bowles, 
father of Samuel Bowles (1 826-1878), its most famous editor. 

The Evening Salem Gazette, originally a weekly (1768), was a 
famous paper during the War of Independence and in the period 
immediately after. The Hampshire Gazette of Northampton, 
Massachusetts, founded in September 1786 in the interests of the 
Administration at the time of Shays's Rebellion, started its daily 
edition in 1890. The weekly Gazette and Courier (1841), was a 
consolidation of the Greenfield Gazette (1792) and the Courier (1838). 
The Salem Register and Mercury continues the Satem Register (1800) 
and the Mercury, which was published in Salem as early as 1768, 
but not continuously. The Haverhill Evening Gazette dates from 
1798. In Pittsfield is published the Berkshire County Eagle, a weekly 
established in 1789, with an evening edition, the Berkshire Evening 
Eagle (189.2). The Newburyport Herald (evening 1880; morning 
1892) continues the title of an earlier paper (1797) owned by Ephraim 
W. Allen and William S. Allen. 

At the commencement of the struggle for independence in 1775 
Massachusetts possessed 7 newspapers, New Hampshire 1 (the New 
Hampshire Gazette), Rhode Island 2, and Connecticut 3, — making 13 
in all for the New England colonies. Pennsylvania had 8, of which 
the earliest in date was the American Weekly Mercury (No. 1. 22nd 
December 1719) ; and New York but 3, the oldest of them being the 
New York Gazette (1725). Up to that period (1725) Boston and 
Philadelphia were the only towns possessing a newspaper throughout 
America. In the middle and southern colonies there were, in 1775, 
in the^ aggregate, 10 journals, of which Maryland, Virginia and North 
Carolina possessed each 2, South Carolina 3 and Georgia 1. The 
tetal number of the An^lo-American papers was 34, and all of them 
were of weekly publication. 

New Hampshire. — The New Hampshire Gazette (1756; daily 
edition since 1852), published at Portsmouth, was the " father " 
of the New England press. The Cheshire Republican (1793) and 
New Hampshire Sentinel (1799; evening edition since 1890) are 
still published at Keene. 

Vermont. — The earliest paper established in Vermont was 
the Green Mountain Postboy, first published in April 1781. The 
oldest important paper in Vermont is the Rutland Herald 
(established in 1794 as a weekly; daily edition since 1861). 
The Vermont Journal of Windsor, Vermont, was established in 
1783. 

Maine. — The first papers of any importance published in 
Maine were the Portland Advertiser (evening, 1785), of which 
James G. Blaine was editor in 185 7-1 860; and the Eastern 
Argus of Portland (September 1803). The latter was established 
by Nathaniel Willis (1780-1870), the father of N. P. Willis. 
Willis was converted in Portland by Edward Payson and about 
1808 he left the paper. In 1816-1826 he established in Boston 
the Recorder, which is supposed to have been the first American 
religious paper. In 1827 Willis established the Youth's Com- 
panion, the most popular American juvenile paper. The Eastern 
Argus was edited in 1 820-1824 by Seba Smith (181 8-1 868), 
who established in 1829 the Portland Courier, which he edited 
until 1837 and to which he contributed the sketches republished 
in 1833 as Life and Letters of Major Jack Downing. 

Connecticut. — The Connecticut Courant of Hartford was 
established in October 1764 as a weekly; in 1893 there appeared 
a semi-weekly issue, and its daily issue, the Hartford Courant, 
first appeared in 1837. The paper was a strong supporter of the 
administrations of Washington and Adams. Probably the best 
known of its editors is Joseph R. Hawley. Charles Dudley 
Warner was long a member of the staff. The Hartford Times 
(semi-weekly 1817; daily, 1841) has always been a prominent 
paper. Its principal early editors were Gideon Wells in 1826- 
1836 (in 1 861-1869 he was United States secretary of the navy), 
and John Milton Niles (1 787-1856), who was United States 
senator in 1835-1839 and 1843-1849 and was postmaster-general 
of the United States in 1 840-1 841. 

Next to the Courant, the oldest paper still published in Con- 
necticut is the New Haven Journal, established as a weekly in 
1766 (the weekly edition is now styled the Connecticut Herald), 
which first appeared as a daily in 1834 as the Morning Journal 
and Courier, The New London Gazette (1763), which in 1773 
became the Connecticut Gazette, ceased publication in 1844. 
Another Gazette was established in New London for a time, 
but is no longer published and was in no way connected with the 
earlier paper. The Danbury News (weekly, 1870, when The 
Times and Jeffersonian were consob'dated; daily, 1883) is known 
for the humorous sketches contributed by its proprietor James 
Montgomery Bailey (1841-1894). The Republican Farmer 
(weekly) was established in 1790 in Danbury and in 18 10 removed 
to Bridgeport; the Evening Farmer was first published in 1855. 
The Norwich Courier (weekly, 1796) has a daily edition, the 
Bulletin (1858). 

Rhode Island. — The oldest paper now published in Rhode 
Island is the Newport Mercury (weekly; 1758), which, like most 
of the other New England patriot sheets, was suppressed in 1765; 
it was established by James Franklin, a nephew of Benjamin 
Franklin. 

Pennsylvania. — The Aurora (1790) was the most notable of 
the early Philadelphia papers, next to Franklin's Gazette. It 
was founded by Franklin's grandson, Benjamin Franklin Bache, 
who in 1784 had started the American Daily Advertiser, the first 
American daily. Bache and his successor William Duane (who 
edited the paper till 1822) bitterly attacked Washington, Adams 
and Hamilton; and the Aurora after 1793 was practically the 
organ of Jefferson, but ceased to be of importance after the 
national capital was removed from Philadelphia. From 1791 
to 1793 the principal Anti-Federalist paper was the National 
Gazette, edited by Philip Freneau, whom Jefferson brought to 
Philadelphia. As opposed to these there was the United States 
Gazette, founded in New York in 1789, but removed to Phila- 
delphia in 1790, which represented Alexander Hamilton. This 
journal afterwards (1826-1847) was an important Whig organ, 
under the editorship of Joseph Ripley Chandler (1 792-1 880). 
In 1847 it was consolidated with the North American (1830), 
which still survives in Philadelphia, having in its progress also 
absorbed the Pennsylvania Gazette (1 720-1845), for a time owned 
by Benjamin Franklin, the Pennsylvania Packet (founded 1771) 
and other papers. 

Other important Philadelphia papers still in existence are, 
the Public Ledger (1836), founded as a one-cent paper, purchased 
in 1864 by George W. Childs, who increased the price from 
6i to 10 cents a week; the Philadelphia Evening Bulletin, which 
consolidated the American Sentinel (181 5) and the Evening 
Bulletin (1847); and the Press (1857), edited from 1880 to 1908 
by Charles Emory Smith (1842-1908), United States Minister 
to Russia in 1890-1892, and postmaster-general of the United 
States in 1898-1902. 

Benjamin Lundy edited in Philadelphia in 1 836-1 838 the 
National Enquirer (anti-slavery), which became the Pennsylvania 
Freeman and in 1838-1840 was edited by John G. Whittier. 

Outside of Philadelphia the oldest papers of importance in Penn- 
sylvania are the Pittsburgh Gazette, first published in 1786 and 
probably the first newspaper published west of the Alleghanies, 
which in 1906 was consolidated with the Times (1879) to form the 
Gazette Times; and the Pittsburgh Post (1792; daily, 1842), one of 
the few influential Democratic papers published in Pennsylvania; the 
Pittsburgh Dispatch (1846) is a morning paper. Other papers 
founded before 1801 (and still published) in Pennsylvania are: the 
Franklin Repository of Chambersburg (weekly, 1^90; daily, 1883), 
of which A. K. McClure was proprietor and editor in 1850-1856; the 
Reading Adler (weekly, 1796), the oldest existing German newspaper 
in the country; the Intelligencer of Lancaster (1799), with which 
the Journal (1794) was combined in 1839; the Westmoreland 
Democrat of Greensburg (weekly, 1799); the Herald of Norristown 
(weekly, 1799; daily, 1848). 

Maryland. — The earliest journal of Maryland was William 
Parks's Maryland Gazette, of Annapolis, begun in 1727, when in all 
America it had but six existing predecessors. Discontinued in 
1736, it was revived in 1739 by Jonas Green and lasted till 1839. 

The oldest paper now published in Baltimore is the American, 
the successor of the Maryland Journal and Baltimore Advertiser 
founded in August 1773; °n the 21st September 1814 it pub- 
lished " The Star Spangled Banner." The Baltimore Sun was 
started in 1837. 

New Jersey. — New Jersey had no really established newspaper 
before the Revolution, although the first number of an intended 
journal was published in 1765, under the title of the Constitu- 
tional Gazette, containing matters interesting to Liberty, but no wise 
repugnant to Royalty. The earliest regular paper was the New 
Jersey Gazette, which began in December 1777 at Burlington 
(soon removing to Trenton), and ceased publication in 1786. 
A State Gazette (weekly), now published in Trenton, dates from 
1792 (daily, 1846); Trenton's largest paper is the Times (evening; 
1882). The Sentinel of Freedom, a Newark weekly, was first 
published in 1796; its daily edition, the Star, dates from 
1832. Newark's largest paper is the Evening News (1883). 
The New Brunswick Times was first published as a weekly in 
1792; a daily edition was added in 1849. 

Virginia. — Virginia, notwithstanding its illustrious pre- 
cedency — the province of Raleigh, the cradle of Washington — 
possessed neither newspaper nor printing office until 1736, so 
that (as respects one-half at least of the wish) there was once a 
prospect that the devout aspiration of Sir William Berkeley 
might be realized. " Thank God," said this Virginian governor 
in 1671, " we have neither free school nor printing press, and I 
hope may not have for a hundred years to come." The earliest 
journal established in the state was the Virginia Gazette, 
commenced in 1736. It was still published at Williamsburg in 
1766, when a second paper of the same name was established 
there. This second paper, backed by Thomas Jefferson, was 
afterwards called the American Advertiser and then the Com- 
mercial Advertiser, and stopped in 1822. The Richmond En- 
quirer, which started in 1808, succeeding the Examiner, early 
attained a leading position as a Democratic organ; it was 
discontinued in 1880. The Alexandria Gazette (1816) is still 
published. 

Washington, D.C. — The first " administration organ " (i.e. 
expressing the political views of the administration, but not 
officially a government paper), was the National Intelligencer 
(1800); this position it held until 1829, when it became an 
opposition paper. In Jackson's administration the United 
States Telegraph, which had been purchased in 1826 by Duff 
Green, became the " administration organ "; but in 1830 
it was supplanted by the Globe. The United States Telegraph, 
which had supported Calhoun, remained his organ until 
1835, strongly favouring slavery and opposing the abolition 
press. The Globe after December 1830 was conducted by 
Francis Preston Blair the elder and John C. Rives (1795-1864); 
it opposed Nullification, Secession, and the Southern wing of the 
Democratic party. In 1841 the National Intelligencer became 
the administration organ; it was succeeded in the same year 
by a new paper, the Daily Madisonian, President Tyler's organ, 
and in 1845 the Union became the organ of President Polk. 
To the Union in 1845 the Globe sold out, but only as a 
party organ. In 1846 to 1871 the Globe was the publisher of 
the Congressional debates. President Taylor's organ during his 
administration was the newly established Republican. During 
President Fillmore's presidency the National Intelligencer, 
which was a Webster-Whig organ, returned to power, and during 
Pierce's administration the Union was again the administration 
organ, with the Evening Star (1852) a close second. In 
Buchanan's administration the influence of the Union continued. 
During the Civil War most of these papers died off, except the 
Star and the National Intelligencer, which in 1870 removed to 
New York, where it stayed as a semi-weekly for some time. 
The Washington Post, now the leading paper, was founded in 
1877. The National Era, the organ of the American and Foreign 
Anti-Slavery Society, first puhlished in Washington in 1844 
(the Cincinnati Philanthropist was merged with it in 1847) by 
Gamaliel Bailey, is known principally because Uncle Tom's 
Cabin ran in its columns as a serial in 1851-1852. A New 
National Era (1870), was conducted in Washington by Frederick 
Douglass and his sons. 

New York, — The New York Gazette (which started in New York 
City on the 16th of October 1725) was followed by the Weekly 
Journal (No. 1, 5th November 1733), still memorable for the 
prosecution for sedition which it entailed on its printer, John 
PetexZenger, and for the masterly defence of the accused by 
Andrew Hamilton. " The trial of Zenger," said Gouverneur 
Morris, " was the germ of American freedom." Gaines's New 
York Mercury was published from 1752 to 1783. James Riving- 
ton (1724-1802) in 1773 published the New York Gazetteer as a 
loyalist sheet, but his press was destroyed in 1775 and he went 
to. England; in 1777 he returned and published Rivington's 
New York Loyal Gazette (semi-weekly), renamed first the Royal 
Gazette and then Rivington's New York Gazette and Universal 
Advertiser, which came to an end in 1783. The semi-weekly 
Independent Journal was one of the papers of New York City in 
which, between October 27th, 1787, and April 2nd, 1788, the 
Federalist essays were published; in 1788 it became part of the 
New York Gazette , and then in 1840 was consolidated with the 
Journal of Commerce, The first daily newspaper published in 
the city or state of New York was the New York Journal and 
Register, commenced in 1788. In 1802 the Morning Chronicle, 
edited by Peter Irving (1771-1838), a brother of Washington 
Irving, was established as Aaron Burr's organ; in 1805 it was 
merged in the Poughkeepsie Journal. Another political paper 
was the Minerva (1793), under Noah Webster, which had a semi- 
weekly edition, the Herald. These in 1797 became the Com- 
tnercial Advertiser and New York Spectator respectively. The 
former (surviving as the Globe and Commerical Advertiser) was 
edited in 1 820-1844 by W. L. Stone and in 1867 by Thurlow 
Weed. 

In 1810 the aggregate number of papers published within the 
state was 66, of which 14 belonged to New York City. Ten years 
later the city press included 8 daily journals, with an aggregate 
daily circulation of 10,800 copies. No one paper circulated more 
than 2000, and but two — the Evening Post (1801) and the Com- 
tnercial Advertiser (1797) — attained that number. 

The New York Evening Post was at first strongly Federalist 
and practically an organ of Alexander Hamilton, who with John 
Jay assisted in founding it. Its first editor was William Coleman 
(1 766-1829). In the years immediately following 18 19 John 
Rodman Drake contributed to the Post the " Croaker " pieces, 
in which FitzGreene Halleck joined. William Cullen Bryant 
began to write for the Post in 1826, and became its editor-in-chief 
in 1828. John Bigelow, Parke Godwin, Carl Schurz, Horace 
White, E. L. Godkin, editor from 1881 to 1901, and Henry 
Villard, are the important names in its history. Rollo Ogden 
became editor in 1903. Closely connected with the Post is 
the weekly Nation, long edited by E. L. Godkin (q.v.). The 
Post was strongly Federalist until the War of 181 2; it opposed 
the Hartford Convention; until i860 it was consistently 
Democratic; it supported Lincoln in i860 and in 1864 and 
Grant in 1868; in later years it was an advocate of free trade 
and of civil service reform. There were earlier Evening Posts 
in 1746-1747 and in 1794. 

The cheap (two-cent) press of America (the previous price 
having usuaDy been six cents) began in New York in the shape 
of the Morning Post (1st January 1833), which only lasted a few 
weeks; the real pioneer was the Daily Sun (No. 1, 23rd 
September 1833), written, edited, set up, and worked off by 
Benjamin Henry Day, a journeyman printer. It sold at one 
cent till the Civil War, when it charged two cents, the price 
remaining at that figure. The New York Sun was acquired in 
1868 by Charles Anderson Dana (q.v.), who made it a powerful 
organ, and under his successor William M. Laffan (1 848-1909) 
it remained one of the great dailies. 

The New York Herald followed in May 1835, founded and 
edited by James Gordon Bennett (q.v.), and his efforts and those 
of his son gave it an enormous commercial success. 

The New York Tribune was established in 1841 by Horace 
Greeley (q.v.)> who remained its editor and one of its proprietors 
until his death, shortly after his defeat for the presidency in 
1872. He was succeeded as editor and proprietor by Whitelaw 
Reid (b. 1837), who had joined the staff in 1868 and afterwards 
became U.S. Ambassador in London. Directed by two such 
men the Tribune became a powerful organ. 

The New York Times, which was to rank with the Tribune 
and Sun among the best modern American daily papers, was 
established by Henry J. Raymond (q.v.) in September 1851; and, 
though absent at times in .the discharge of his duties as lieut.- 
governor of New York and member of Congress, he continued 
its editor and chief proprietor until his death in June 1869. 
At the end of the century, under the control of Mr Adolph S. 
Ochs (b. 1858), it was prominent in American journalism for the 
excellence of its news service and literary character. 

The New York World was founded in i860 as a highly moral 
and religious sheet, which immediately failed and had to be 
reorganized. In 186 1 the Morning Courier and the Enquirer 
were merged into it. In 1864 it and the Journal of Commerce 
were suppressed for several days by the Federal authorities 
because each had been tricked into publishing a forged presidential 
proclamation of a draft and of a general fast day. In 1869 it 
became the sole property of Manton Marble (b. 1834), who 
retired from its editorship in 1875; in 1876 it was sold to a 
syndicate and came under the control of Jay Gould; in 1883 it 
was purchased by Joseph Pulitzer (b. 1847), and its modern 
activity began. It worked hard for Grover Cleveland, especially 
in his first campaign, and opposed W. J. Bryan and his policies. 

The journals owned by W. R. Hearst (b. 1863) all over America 
represent perhaps more conspicuously than any others the 
popular developments which at the end of the 19th century 
were associated with the nickname of the " Yellow Press." 
His papers in New York in 1910 were the American (originally 
Journal; morning except Sunday); the Evening Journal, the 
American and Journal (Sunday) and Das Morgen Journal. 
Starting in the 'nineties as proprietor of the San Francisco 
Examiner, Mr Hearst had a large fortune to enable him to carry 
out his ideas of a thoroughgoing democratic journalism, appealing 
particularly to the less literate masses and supplying all sorts 
of sensational news. The class prejudice often underlying the 
policy of his papers was bitterly criticized and resented by sober 
American opinion, but their passionate appeal to the masses, 
combined with their audacious and lively presentation of news, 
gave Mr Hearst nevertheless a position of considerable power; 
and no secret was made of his ambition to reach the highest 
political'.positions, both in New York itself and in the Republic. 
Dangerous as his social influence was considered by important 
sections of the community, and unsuccessful as he remained up 
to 1910 in obtaining municipal office or presidential nomination, 
it remained the fact that, in the type of journalism so indefatigably 
conducted under him, he represented a serious force in American 
social and political life, and his journalistic methods were a 
remarkable outcome of the conditions of a modern free press 
in a democratic country, where a large public exists for the 
consumption of the sort of newspaper fare which he was ready 
to provide. 

The New York Press (1887) is a morning Republican paper of 
the strictest party type. 

An important commercial paper of long standing in New York 
is the Journal of Commerce and Commercial Bulletin, founded 
in 1827 as the Journal of Commerce by Arthur Tappan (1786- 
1865) and his brother Lewis Tappan (1 788-1873), and in 1893 
consolidated with the Commercial Bulletin (1865). The Journal 
of Commerce in 1820-1830 was the first American paper to send 
out news schooners which intercepted packet ships which brought 
news especially of the French Revolution of 1830. Arthur 
Tappan, who was one of the founders of Oberlin College, estab- 
lished in 1833 the Emancipator, an abolitionist paper, of which 
in 1 833-1 83 7 Elizur Wright (1 804-1 885), and in 183 7- 1840 
Joshua Leavitt (1 794-1873), were editors. Leavitt took the 
paper to Boston. It was the weekly organ of the American 
Anti-Slavery Society. 

The New York Evening Mail (1833), for a time the Mail 
and Express, was bought in 1888 and reorganized by Elliott 
Fitch Shepard (1833-1893). The Express was established in 
1836 with the help of Willis Hall (1801-1868), a prominent 
Whig lawyer and politician, by James Brooks (1810-1873), 
who had formerly been on the Portland Advertiser and in 1832 
had written (for the Advertiser) the first regular Washington 
correspondence. His brother Erastus (1815-1886) was joint 
owner of the Express in 1836-1877. James Brooks wrote several 
books of travel and was involved in- the scandal of the Credit 
Mobilier. 

Of the New York newspapers not in English the most important 
are the following. The Staats-Zeitung (evening, 1834) is published 
by a company of which in 1909 Herman Ridder (b. 1851) was 
president, having since 1890 been treasurer and manager. Ridder, 
a prominent German Democrat and Roman Catholic, established in 
1886 the Catholic News, a weekly with a large circulation, edited by 
his son Henry Ridder. The Zeitung (morning, 1845), Herald (even- 
ing, 1879), and Revue (Sundays) are other German papers published 
by one company. Mr Hearst's Das Morgen Journal dates from 
1890. A Socialist Labour paper — daily Volks Zeitung and weekly 
Vorwaerts — was established in 1878. The Jewish Daily News and 
(weekly) Jewish Gazette (1874) in Yiddish and English have large 
circulations; so have the Jewish Morning Journal (1901 ; Abend 
Post, 1899, and weekly, Jewish Journal, 1899); the Jewish Herald 
(evening) and Volksadvocat (weekly), both editions, 1887; and 
Forward (evening, 1897). The Courrier des Etats-Unis (1828) 
publishes small daily, Sunday and weekly editions. There are four 
Italian dailies, the more important being VAraldo Italiano (1894) 
and II Progresso Italo-Americano (1879). The Atlantis (evening, 
1894) is a Greek daily. The Listy (1875) and Hlas Lidu (1886) are 
Bohemian dailies; the Narodni List (1898) is a Croatian daily; the 
Gaelic American (1903), Irish Nationalist (1888), Irish-American 
(1849) and Irish World are Irish weeklies printed in English; the 
Amerikai Magyar Nepsava (1897) is a Hungarian daily, also pub- 
lished in Cleveland, Ohio; the Glas Naroda (1893) is a small Slavonic 
daily. 

Among the New York weekly publications must be mentioned 
Harper's Weekly, founded in 1856; George William Curtis was 
first connected with^ it in 1857, and after 1864 was its political 
editor. Under Curtis it was a powerful advocate of civil service 
reform, and its campaigns against Tammany were made famous by 
the cartoons of Thomas Nast. During the Civil War Harper s 
Weekly published Nast's sketches in the field. Frank Leslie's 
Illustrated Newspaper (now Leslie's Weekly) was founded in 1855 
by Frank Leslie (1821-1880), whose ability as a wood-engraver was 
the basis of its success. Nast was employed by Leslie in 1854 and 
subsequent years, and was sent to England to sketch the Heenan- 
Sayers fight. With Harper's and Leslie's Weeklies ranks Collier's 
Weekly, established in 1*888 by Peter Fenelon Collier (d. 1909). 

The following are newspapers of Brooklyn. The Eagle (evening, 
1841), of which Walt Whitman was editor in 1 846-1 847, came in 
1885 under the editorship of St Clair McKelway (b. 1845), editor in 
1878-1885 of the Albany Argus. The Times (evening, 1848), like the 
Eagle, makes a specialty of the news ol Long Island. Brooklyner 
Freie Presse (evening, 1864). The Standard Union (evening, 1864). 
The Citizen (evening, 1886). 

Outside of New York City the most important papers in the 
political history of the state have been those of Albany. The 
Albany Argus, established in 1813 (daily, 1824), was the organ of 
the famous Albany Regency. The Evening Journal of Albany was 
established in 1830 by Thurlow Weed, who controlled it for 35 
years. After 1865 it became the property of Samuel Wilkeson (1817— 
1889), and in 1889 William Barnes, Jr., became its editor. The Argus 
and the Journal held alternately the valuable state printing. A 
factional fight in the Democratic party over the printing resulted 
in the establishment of the Atlas in 1843; in 1858 this was con- 
solidated with the Argus. 

In Buffalo the oldest paper is the Commercial, the successor of 
the Buffalo Gazette (181 1, weekly), which in 1818 became the Niagara 
Patriot and in 1820 the Buffalo Patriot, and in 1834 the Buffalo 
Patriot and Commercial Advertiser. The daily issue began in 1835 as 
the Commercial Advertiser', the weekly was still called by the earlier 
name. The weekly ceased publication in 1909. In 1890 the daily 
became the Commercial. The first daily in Buffalo was the Courier 
(1828), controlled in 1909 by W. J. Conners. The Evening Times 
(1885) was in 1909 edited by Norman Mack, who was in 1908 
treasurer of the Democratic National Committee. 

In Rochester are the Democrat and Chronicle (morning and 
weekly; Democrat, 1826; Chronicle, 1868); Post-Express (evening, 
1858); Herald (morning, 1870); and Union and Advertiser (evening, 
182,6). It was in Rochester that Myron Holly (1779-1841), who had 
formerly edited the Lyons (N.Y.) Countryman (anti-masonic), edited 
the Freeman, an anti-slavery paper; and here in 1847-1860 
Frederick Douglass edited the North Star, called Frederick Douglass's 
Paper after 1855. 

In Syracuse are the Evening Herald (1877) and the Post-Standard 
(morning, Standard, 1829. and Post. 1894, consolidated in 1899). 

In Troy are the Record (morning and evening, successor to the 
Post, 1812), the Times (daily, 1851; weekly, 1856), the Evening 
Standard (1877), and the Northern Budget (weekly only, 1797). 

The Utica Herald-Despatch and Daily Gazette is the successor of 
the Whitestown Gazette (1793); the Daily Gazette first appeared in 
1842; the Morning Herald (1847) was consolidated with it in 1867; 
and in 1900 it was purchased by the owners of the Evening Despatch 
(1898). 

In Catskill, Greene county, New York, was established in August 
1792 by Mackay Croswell the Packet, which in May 1804 was suc- 
ceeded by the Recorder, which in 1909 was still published as a weekly, 
the largest in the county. Mackay Croswell 's son Edwin Croswell 
(1797-1871) left the Recorder in 1823 and in 1824 became editor of 
the Albany Argus; Croswell was state printer in 1824-1840 and 
1 844-1 847. 

Other papers (mostly with small circulations) in New York state 
founded before 1801 are: the Gazette of Hudson (weekly, 1785; 
daily, Evening Register, 1866); the Register of Newburgh (1796; 
now a daily only); the Washington County Post of Cambridge 
(weekly only, 1798); the Journal of Ballston Spa (weekly, 1798; 
Ballston Daily Journal, 1894; Republican) ; and the Gazette of Owego 
(weekly only, 1800). 

Ohio. — The Repository (weekly, 1815; daily, 1878), formerly 
the Ohio Repository, of Canton, is one of the oldest papers in 
Ohio. The Western Hemisphere of Columbus was purchased 
in 1836 by Samuel Medary (1801-1864), who changed its name 
to the Ohio Statesman; Medary— the "old wheel hors.e of 
Democracy," who is said to have originated the cry of " Fifty- 
four, forty, or fight 1" — was a friend of Stephen A. Douglas and 
governor of Minnesota in 1857-1858 and of Kansas in 1858- 
1860; S. S. Cox was editor of the Statesman in 1 853-1 854. 

The Weekly Gazette of Cincinnati (founded in 1793 as the 
Centinel; in 1804-1815 called the Liberty Hall; in 1815-1883 
the Cincinnati Gazette), and the Commercial Tribune (morning; 
formed in 1896 by the consolidation of the Commercial Gazette 
and Tribune), are published by the same firm. In 1825-1840 
Charles Hammond (1770-1841), an anti-slavery leader, was 
editor of the Gazette. The Commercial was made by Murat 
Halstead (18 20-1 908), a prominent Republican politician, and 
writer of several " campaign lives " of Republican presidential 
candidates, who was the first editor in the Middle West to get 
news freely by telegraph. The Cincinnati Enquirer (morning, 
1842) became a great power in Ohio politics under the ownership 
(after 1852) of Washington McLean and his son John R. McLean. 
The Post (1880), the Times-Star {Times 1836), the Volksblatt 
(1836), .the Volksfreund (daily 1850; weekly 1852), and the 
Freie Presse (1874) are the other large dailies of 'Cincinnati. 
In Cincinnati James G. Birney established in 1835 ths Philan- 
thropist, an anti-slavery paper, which Gamaliel Bailey edited 
in 1 83 7-1847. 

The Cleveland Leader (Republican, 1847) was bought in 1853 
by Edwin Cowles (1825-1890) and Joseph Medill (after 1855 
of the Chicago Tribune). Cowles became sole owner in 1854; 
he was an anti-slavery Whig and one of the founders of the 
Republican party in the state. The Leader of 1853 was a con- 
solidation of the Cleveland Forest City, a Whig paper founded 
in 1849 by Joseph Medill and united in 1852 with the Free 
Democrat. Like the Chicago Tribune it was in 1909 controlled 
by MedilFs grandson, Medill McCormick (b. 1877), a son-in-law 
of M. A. Hanna. The Press of Cleveland (evening, independent) 
was established in 1878 by James Edmund Scripps (1835-1906); 
with Milton A. McRae (b. 1858) he formed the Scripps-McRae 
Press Association of Cleveland and the Scripps-McRae League, 
which included the Cincinnati Post, the St Louis Slar-Chronicle, 
the Cleveland Press, the Kentucky Post of Covington, the 
Columbus Citizen, and the Times, the News-Bee and Times* 
Bee of Toledo. Scripps and McRae organized the Publishers* 
Press Association of New York, a rival of the Associated Press. 
Scripps in his later years was a benefactor of the city of Detroit, 
where he had established (1873) the Evening News. The Cleveland 
Plain-Dealer (morning, .1841) is a well-known paper; in its 
columns appeared the first " Artemus Ward " sketches, contri- 
buted by Charles Farrar Browne (1834-1867), who in 1861 went 
to New York to edit the short-lived humorous Vanity Fair. 
The Waechter und Anzeiger (Waeckler 1852; Anzeiger 1872) is 
published in Cleveland. 

The larger papers of Columbus are the Ohio Stale Journal 
{morning, 1811), the Press-Post (evening, 1827), .the Citizen 
(evening, 1899),- and the Express und Westhole (weekly, 1880; 
Sunday, 1878; daily, 1890 — the different editions being under 
different names). The News of Springfield has a weekly edition, 
the Weekly Republic, which was founded in 181 7. The Toledo 
Blade (daily, 1848; weekly, 1835) before and during the Civil 
War contained the attacks on slavery and on political abuses 
written by " Petroleum V. Nasby," i.e. David Ross Locke 
(1833-1888). The first of these letters (signed " Rev. Petroleum 
Vesuvious Nasby") appeared in the Jejjersonian of Findlay, 
Ohio, in i860, when he was its editor. He had edited small 
papers in Plymouth and Mansfield (O.) before his connexion 
with the Blade; in 1871 he became managing editor of the 
Evening Mail of New York City. Will Carleton (b. 1845) was 
a member of the Blades staff, and contributed to the Blade 
his first " ballads." The News-Bee (evening) of Toledo was 
formed by the consolidation in 1003 of the Times (1846), News 
(1888) and Bee (1894), and has a morning edition called the Times 
and a Sunday edition called the Times-Bee. The Zanesville 
Courier (Republican; daily, 1846) has a weekly edition dating 
from 1809 (originally the Muskingum Messenger). 

Among the smaller newspapers of Ohio the following are more than 
100 years old: the Western Star of Lebanon (weekly, 1806); the 
Ohio Patriot of Lisbon (weekly, 1808; daily and semi- weekly, 1898); 
and the Journal of Dayton (morning, 1808). 

Illinois. — The first newspaper in Illinois was the Illinois 
Herald (18 14; succeeded in 18 15 by the Illinois Intelligencer) 
of Kaskaskia (then the seat of government); it removed to 
Vandalia, which then became the capital, in 1820; it became 
the Vandalia Whig and Illinois Intelligencer in 1832; and it 
ceased publi cation about 1839, when Springfield became the 
capital. 

The principal papers in Illinois are naturally those of Chicago. 
The Chicago Tribune (morning; 1847) succeeded The Gem of 
the Prairie (1844), and a weekly edition was for a time continued 
under that name. In August 1848 John Locke Scripps (1818- 
1866) bought a third interest in the Tribune and became its 
managing editor. In 1852 he sold it to a syndicate of Whig 
politicians. A part (in 1855) and eventually the whole (in 1874) 
was bought by Joseph Medill (1823-1899). Horace White 
(b. 1834) was a reporter on the Tribune in 1856, and was its 
editor 'and one of its proprietors in 1864-1874; from 1883 to 
1903 he was editor-in-chief of the New York Evening Post. 
In 1858 the Daily Democratic Press , which J. L. Scripps had 
established in 1852 with William Bross, was consolidated with 
the Tribune as the Press and Tribune; in i860 the name became 
the Tribune again; the Tribune Company was incorporated 
in 1 86 1, with J. L. Scripps as its president. The first newspaper 
published in Chicago, the Democrat (November 1833), was 
merged with the Daily Tribune in 1861. The Inter-Ocean 
(morning; 1872), under the editorship (from 1897) of George 
Wheeler Hinman (b. 1863), has made a specialty of foreign 
affairs. The News (evening ; 1875) was founded and developed by 
Melville E. Stone (b. 1848) as a one-cent evening paper. After 
1883 Eugene Field contributed to this paper his column " Sharps 
and Flats," including much verse. In 1888 Victor Fremont 
Lawson (b. 1850), who had been associated with Stone, acquired 
the paper. The Record (morning; 1881), started by Lawson, was 
consolidated in 1001 with the Herald (1881) as the Record-Herald.^ 
The Evening Post dates from 1889. In 1900 W. R. Hearst estab- 
lished in Chicago two papers, Hearst's Evening American and the' 
Examiner (the name assumed in 1002 for his morning American). 
The Chicago German papers include the Freie Presse (evening 
and weekly; 1871), the Slaals-Zeitung (daily, 1847, weekly — 
Westen und Daheim — 1845; evening edition, the Abend Presse) 
and Abendpost (1899). The Skandinaven (semi-weekly, 1866; 
daily, 1871) is an important Norwegian-Danish paper; and 
there are large Bohemian and Polish dailies. 

In Springfield, the state capital, there are two party journals, 
the Illinois State Journal (Republican; semi-weekly, 1831 ; daily, 
1848) and the Illinois State Register (Democratic; weekly, 1836; 
daily, 1848). 

Michigan. — The Detroit Free Press (morning, 1835; with a weekly 
agricultural edition, Farm and Live Stock Journal, 1831) was 
particularly known in 1860-1891 for the humorous sketches of 
Charles Bertrand Lewis (b. 1842), who wrote under the pseudonym 
" M. Quad." The News (morning, 1873) was established by J. E. 
Scripps (1835-1906). 

Missouri. — The oldest paper is the Republic of St Louis, formerly 
the Republican, founded as a weekly in July 1808, by Joseph 
Charless, an Irishman who had worked on the Kentucky Gazette 
in Lexington; it was called first the Missouri Gazette, then (1809) 
the Louisiana Gazette, then (1812) the Missouri Gazette again, and 
then (1822) the Missouri Republican, and in 1886-1888 the St Louis 
Republican; the present name was adopted in 1888. Its first 
daily issue was in September 1836 and the first Sunday issue in 
1848. The Republican was originally a Jeffersonian Democratic 
paper; it opposed Thos. H. Benton; it supported Wm. Henry 
Harrison in 1840, and became a Whig organ; and from 1856 was a 
Democratic paper. A cause celebre was the trial in 1830 for the 
impeachment of Judge James H. Peck of the U.S. District Court 
for Missouri, who had suspended from practice for 18 months and 
had imprisoned for 24 hours an attorney, Luke Edward Lawless, 
who had criticized in the Republican Judge Peck's decision in a 
Spanish land grant case, which was adverse to Lawless, attorney 
for the plaintiff. William Wirt appeared for Peck, and he was 
acquitted. Since 1837 the paper has been almost continuously the 
property of the Knapp and Paschall families. In 1871 the Repub- 
lican purchased a Walter press from The Times of London; it 
introduced stereotyping in i860, probably before any other news- 
paper. The Globe-Democrat (morning; Republican, 1852) of St 
Louis early became a valuable property: in 1872 it was sold for 
$456,100. In St Louis in 1833-1836 Elijah P. Lovejoy published 
the Observer, primarily a religious paper, which because of local 
opposition to its attacks on slavery he removed in July 1836 to 
Alton, 111., where, he was killed by a mob. 

The Post-Dispatch (evening, 1851) is a consolidation made in 
1878 by its proprietor Joseph Pulitzer. Pulitzer's first newspaper 
experience was in 1868 as a reporter on the Westliche Post (morning, 
1857) of St Louis, ^which has an evening edition, the Anzeiger, a 
Sunday edition, Mississippi Blaetter, and a semi-weekly and weekly 
edition, Anzeiger des Westens. Carl Schurz was editor of the West- 
liche Post in 1867. Another German newspaper in St Louis is 
Amerika (morning; 1872). 

The two principal dailies of Kansas City are the Star (evening, 
1880-1881; with a morning edition, the Times, 1838, and a Weekly 
Star, 1890), founded by William R. Nelson (b. 1841) ; and the Journal

4. Newspapers of France 

The annals of French journalism begin with the Gazette 
(afterwards called Gazette de France), established by Th6o- 
phraste Renaudot in 1631, under the patronage of 
Richelieu, and with his active co-operation. Its price %"%* * 
was six centimes. Much of its earliest foreign news 
came direct from the minister, and not seldom in his own hand. 
Louis XIII. took a keen, perhaps a somewhat childish, interest 
in the progress of the infant Gazette, and was a frequent con- 
tributor, now and then taking his little paragraphs to the printing 
office himself, and seeing them put into type. Renaudot was 
born at Loudun in 1584, studied medicine in Paris and at Mont- 
pellier, established himself in the capital in 161 2, and soon became 
conspicuous both within and beyond the limits of his profession. 
Endowed by nature with great energy and versatility, he seems 
at an early period of his career to have attracted the attention 
of the great cardinal, and to bave obtained permission to establish 
a sort of general agency office, under the designation of " Bureau 
d'Adresses et de Rencontre." An enterprise like this would, 
perhaps, naturally suggest to such a mind as Renaudot's the 
advantage of following it up by tbe foundation of a newspaper. 
According to some French writers, however, the project was 
formed by Pierre d'Hozier, the genealogist, who carried on an 
extensive correspondence both at home and abroad, and was 
thus in a position to give valuable help; according to others 
by Richelieu himself. Be this as it may, Renaudot put his hand 
zealously to the work, and brought out his first weekly number 
in May 1631. So much, at least, may be inferred from the date 
(4th July 1 631) of the sixth number, which was the first dated 
publication, the five preceding numbers being marked by 
" signatures " only — A to E. Each number consists of a single 
sheet (eight pages) in small quarto, and is divided into two 
parts — the first simply entitled Gazette, the second Nouvelles 
ordinaires de divers endroits. For this division the author 
assigns two reasons — (i) that two persons may thus read his 
journal at the same time, and (2) that it facilitates a division 
of the subject-matter, the Nouvelles containing usually intel- 
ligence from the northern and western countries, the Gazette 
from the southern and eastern. He commonly begins with 
foreign and ends with home news, a method which was long and 
generally followed, and which still obtains. Once a month he 
published a supplement, under the title of Relation des nouvelles 
du monde, recites dans tout le mois. In October 163 1 Renaudot 
obtained letters patent to himself and his heirs, conferring the 
exclusive privilege of printing and selling, where and how they 
might please, " the gazettes, news and narratives of all that 
has passed or may pass within and without the kingdom." 
His assailants were numerous, but he steadily pursued his course, 
and at his death in October 1653 left the Gazette to his sons in 
flourishing circumstances. In 1752 the title Gazette de France 
was first used. Under this designation it continued to appear 
until the 24th August 1S48. During the five days which followed 
that date it was suspended; on the 30th it was resumed as Le 
Peuple francais, journal de Pappeld la nation, and again modi- 
fied on the 14th September to VEtoile de la France, journal des 
droits de tons. On the 25th October it became Gazette de France, 
journal de I'appeld la nation; and under this title it continued. 

Jean Loret's rhymed Gazelle (1650 to March 1665) will always 
have interest in the eyes of students who care less for the 
" dignity " of history than for the fidelity Of its local colour- 
ing and the animation of its backgrounds. It were vain to 
look there for any deep appreciation of the events of those 
stormy times; but it abounds in vivid portraits of the men 
and manners of the day. It paints rudely, yet to the life, the 
Paris of the Fronde, with all its effervescence and depression, 
its versatility and fickleness, its cowardice and its courage. 
Of the Mercure galant, established by Donneau de Vize in 
1672, with Thomas Corneille for its sub-editor, it may be said 
that it sought to combine the qualities of the Gazettes, 
de France. k° tn grave and gay. Like the Gazette de France, it 
contained the permitted state news and court circulars 
of the day. Like Loret's Gazette, it amused its readers 
with satirical verses, and with sketches of men and manners, 
which, if not always true, were at least well invented. Reviews 
and sermons, law pleas and street airs, the last reception at the 
Academy and the last new fashion of the milliners, all found 
their place. De Vize carried on his enterprise for more than 
thirty years, and at his death (1710) it was continued by Riviere 
du Fresny. The next editor, Lefevre de Fontenay, altered 
the title to Nouveau Mercure, which in 1728 was altered to 
Mercure de France, a designation retained, with slight modifica- 
tion, until 1853. The Mercure passed through many hands 
before it came into those of Panckoucke, at the eve of the Revolu- 
tion. Amongst its more conspicuous writers, immediately before 
this change, had been Raynal and Marmontel. The latter, 
indeed, had for many years been its principal editor, and in his 
Mimoires has left us a very interesting record of the views and 
aims which governed him in the performance of an arduous 
task. He there narrates the curious fact that it was Madame 
de Pompadour who contrived the plan of giving pensions to 
eminent men of letters out of the profits of the Mercure. To 
one of Marmontel 's predecessors the " privilege," or patent, 
had been worth more than £1000 sterling annually. This 
revenue was now to be shared amongst several, and to become 
a means of extending royal " patronage " of literature at a 
cheap rate. It is to this pension scheme, too, that we owe the 
Contes Moraux. Marmontel, who had long before lost his 
" patent " by an act of high-minded generosity, continued to 
share in the composition of the literary articles with Chamfort 
and La Harpe, whilst Mallet du Pan, a far abler writer than 
either, became the most prominent of the political writers in 
the Mercure. In 1789 he contributed a series of remarkable 
articles on the well-known book of de Lolme; and in the same 
year he penned some comments on the " Declaration of the 
Rights of Man," very distasteful to violent men of all parties, 
but which forcibly illustrate the pregnant truth they begin 
with: "The gospel has given the simplest, the shortest and 
the most comprehensive ' Declaration of the Rights of Man/ 
in saying, * Do unto others as you would that they should do 
unto you.' All politics hinge upon this." 

In 1790 the sale of the Mercure rose very rapidly. It attained 
for a time a circulation of 13,000 copies. Mirabeau styled 
it in debate " the most able of the newspapers." Great pains 
were taken in the collection of statistics and state papers, the 
absence of which from the French newspaper press had helped 
to depress its credit as compared with the political journalism 
of England and to some extent of Germany. But, as the Revo- 
lution marched on towards a destructive democracy, Mallet du 
Pan evinced more and more unmistakably his rooted attach- 
ment to a constitutional monarchy. And, like so many of his 
compatriots, he soon found the tide too strong for him. The 
political part of the Mercure (in 1791 its title was altered to 
Mercure franqais) changed hands, and after the 10th August 
1792 its publication was suspended. 

All this time the Moniteur {Gazette nationale, ou le moniteur 
universel), founded in 1789, was under the same general manage- 
ment. The first idea, indeed, of this famous official 
journal appears to have been Panckoucke's, but it tm ^ tKm j, 
did not firmly establish itself until he had purchased 
the Journal de VassembUe nationale, and so secured the 
best report of the debates. The Moniteur, however, kept 
step with the majority of the assembly, the Mercure with the 
minority. So marked a contrast between two journals, with 
one proprietor, gave too favourable a leverage to the republican 
wits not to be turned to good account. Camille Desmoulins 
depicted him as Janus — one face radiant at the blessings of 
coming liberty, the other plunged in grief for the epoch that 
was rapidly disappearing. 

When resumed, after a very brief interval, the Mercure 
jrancais became again Mercure de France — its political im- 
portance diminished, whilst its literary worth was enhanced. 
During the later days of the Revolution, and under the imperial 
rule, its roll of contributors included the names of Geoffroy, 
Ginguen6, Morellet, Lacretelle, Fontanes and Chateaubriand. 
The statesman last named brought upon the Mercure another 
temporary suppression in June 1807 (at which date he was 
its sole proprietor), by words in true unison with the noblest 
deed of his chequered career — his retirement, namely, from 
the imperial service on the day that the news of the execution 
of the duke of Enghien reached him, being the day after he had 
been appointed by Napoleon a minister plenipotentiary. 

Thus it chanced that alike under the brilliant despotism of 
Napoleon and under the crapulous malversation of Louis XV. 
the management of the Mercure was revolutionized for protests 
which conferred honour upon the journal no less than upon 
the individual writers who made them. Resumed by other 
hands, the 'Mercure continued to appear until January 1820, 
when it was again suspended. In the following year it reappeared 
as Le Mercure de France, au dix-neuvieme Steele, and in February 
1853 it finally ceased. 

The only other newspaper of a date anterior to the Revolution 
which needs to be noticed here is the first French daily, the 
Journal de Paris, which was started on New Year's 
Day of 1777. It had but a feeble infancy, yet lived departs. 
till 1819. Its tameness, however, did not save it from 
sharing in the " suspensions " of its predecessors. After the 
Revolution such men as Garat, Condorcet and Regnaud de 
St Jean d'Ange*ly appear amongst its contributors, but those 
of earlier date were obscure. Its period of highest prosperity 
may be dated about 1792, when its circulation is said to have 
exceeded 20,000. 

The police adventures of the writers of the MS. news-letters, 
or Nouvelles & la main, were still more numerous, and, if we 
may judge from the copious specimens of these epistles which yet 
survive, must also not unfrequently have arisen from lack of 
official employment, rather than from substantial pro- 
NouveUes vocation. Madame Doublet de Persan, the widow of 
mate. a member of the French board of trade, was a con- 
spicuous purveyor of news of this sort. For nearly 
forty years daily meetings were held in her house at which the 
gossip and table-talk of the town were systematically (and 
literally) registered; and weekly abstracts or epitomes were 
sent into the country by post. Piron, Mirabaud, Falconet, 
D'Argental and, above all, Bachaumont, were prominent 
members of the "society," and each of them is said to have 
had his assigned seat beneath his own portrait. The lady's 
valet-de-chambre. appears to have been editor ex officio; and 
as he occasionally suffered imprisonment, when offensive news- 
letters had been seized by the police, so responsible a duty was 
doubtless " considered in the wages." News and anecdotes 
of all kinds — political and literary, grave, gay or merely scandal- 
ous — were all admitted into the Nouvelles & la main; and their 
contents, during a long series of years, form the staple of those 
Memoires secrets pour servir & Vhistoire de la republique des 
letires which extend to thirty-six volumes, have been frequently 
printed (at first with the false imprint "Londres: John Adam- 
son, 1777-89 ")i an d are usually referred to by French writers 
as the Mimoires de Bachaumont. 

The journalism of the first Revolution has been the theme 
of many bulky volumes, and only a very casual glance at this 
News' P art °f our subject can be given to it here. When 
papers of at least one half of the French people was in a ferment 
tbeR *' of hope or of fear at the approaching convocation 
ve u on. ^ ^ e states-general, most of the existing newspapers 
were still in a state of torpor. Long paragraphs, for .example, 
about a terrible " wild beast of the Gevaudan " — whether wolf 
or bear, or as yet nondescript, was uncertain — were still current 
in the Paris journals at this momentous juncture. Mirabeau 
was among the foremost to supply the popular want. His 
Letires & ses commetianis began on the 2nd May 1789, and with 
the twenty-first number became the Courrier de Provence. 
Within a week Maret (afterwards duke of Bassano) followed 
with the Bulletin des seances de Vassemblee nationale t and 
Lehodey with the Journal des Mats gtniraux. In June Brissot 
de Warville began his Patriate franqais. Gorsas published the 
first number of his Cotirrier de Versailles in the following month, 
from which also dates the famous periodical of Prudhomme, 
Loustalot and Tournon, entitled Revolutions de Paris , with 
its characteristic motto — " Les grands ne nous paraissent 
-grands que parce que nous sommes a genoux; levons nous! " 
In August 1789 Baudouin began the Journal des debats (edited 
Journal in 1 792 by Louvet) and Marat the Ami du Peuple 
desdSbats (which at first was called Le Publkiste parisien). 
*Moniteur Moniteur ttniversel (of which we have spoken 

already) was first published on the 24th November, 
although numbers were afterwards printed bearing date from 
the 5th May, the day on which the states-general first assembled. 
Camille Desmoulins also commenced his' Revolutions de France 
el de Brabant in November 1789. The Ami du rot was first 
published in June 1790, La Quotidienne in September 1792. 

The Moniteur and Debats survived, but most of these papers 
expired either in the autumn of 1 792 or with the fall of the party 
of the Gironde in September 1793. In some of them the energy 
for good and for evil of a whole lifetime seems to be compressed 
into the fugitive writings of a few months. Even the satirical 
journals which combated the Revolution with shafts of ridicule 
and wit, keen enough after their kind, but too light to do 
much damage to men terribly in earnest, abound with matter 
well deserving the attention of all students desirous of a thorough 
knowledge of the period. 

The consular government began its dealings with the press 
. by reducing the number of political papers to thirteen. At this 
period the number of daily journals had been nineteen, and 
, their aggregate provincial circulation, apart from the Paris 
sale, 49,313* an average of 2600 each. 

Under Napoleon the Moniteur was the only political paper 
that was really regarded with an eye of favour. Even as respects 
the nation at large, the monstrous excesses into which the 
Revolutionary press had plunged left an enduring stigma on 
the class. When Bertin acquired the Journal des debats from 
Baudouin, the printer, for 20,000 francs, he had to vanquish 
popular indifference on the one hand, as well as imperial mistrust 
on the other. The men he called to his aid were Geoffroy and 
Fievee; and by the brilliancy of their talents and the keenness 
of his own judgment he converted the Debats into a paper having 
32,000 subscribers, and producing a profit of 200,000 francs 
a year. When the imposition of a special censorship was 
threatened in 1805, at the instance of Fouche, a remarkable 
correspondence took place between Fiev6e and Napoleon himself, 
in the course of which the emperor wrote that the only means 
of preserving a newspaper from suspension was " to avoid the 
publication of any news unfavourable to the government, until 
the truth of it is so well established that the publication becomes 
needless." The censorship was avoided, but Fiev6e had to 
become the responsible editor, and the title was altered to 
Journal de P empire — the imperial critic taking exception to 
the word Debats as " inconvenient." The old title was resumed 
in August 181 5. The revolution of Julv did but enhance the 
power and the profit of the paper. It has held its course since 
with uniform dignity, as well as with splendid ability, and may 
still be said, in the words which Lamartine applied to it in an 
earlier day, to have " made itself part of French history." 

Shortly before the Journal de Vempire became again the 
Journal des debats (in 1815), a severance 'occurred amidst 
both the writers and subscribers. It led to the foundation 
of the Constihttionnel } which at first and for a short time bore 
the title of Ulndipendant. The former became, for a time, the 
organ of the royalists par excellence, the latter the leader of the 
opposition. In 1824, however, both were in conflict with the 
government of the day. At that date, in a secret report addressed 
to the ministry, the aggregate circulation of the opposition 
press of Paris was stated at 4i,33o, 1 while that of the government 
press amounted only to i4,344. 2 

The rapid rise of the Constitutional was due partly to the 
great ability and influence of Jay, of fitienne, of Beranger 
and of Saint Albin (who had been secretary to Carnot 
in his ministry of 181 5), all of whom co-operated in f a ^^ Bh 
its early editorship, and partly to its sympathy with 
the popular reverence for the memory of Napoleon, as well 
as to the vigorous share it took in the literary quarrel between 
the classicists and romanticists. Its part in bringing about 
the revolution of 1830 raised it to the zenith of its fortunes. 
For a brief period it could boast of 23,000 subscribers at 80 
francs a year. But the invasion of cheap newspapers, and that 
temporary lack of enterprise which so often follows a brilliant 
success, lowered it with still greater rapidity. When the author 
of the Mtmoires dhm bourgeois ; Dr Veron, purchased it, the 
sale had sunk to 3000. Veron gave 100,000 francs for the Juif 
errant of Sue, and the Sue fever rewarded him for a while with 
more than the old circulation. Afterwards the paper passed 
under the editorship of Cesena, Granier de Cassagnac, and La 
Gueronniere. 

The cheap journalism of Paris began in 1836 (1st July) with 
the journal of Girardin, La Presse t followed instantly by Le 
Siecle t under the management of Dutacq, to whom, 
it is said — not incredibly — the original idea was really ^"^ nssc 
due. The first-named journal attained a circulation ^ e Steele* 
of 10,000 copies within three months of its commence- 
ment of and soon doubled that number. The Siecle prospered 
even more strikingly, and in a few years had reached a circula- 
tion (then without precedent in France) of 38,000 copies.

Louis-Philippe will be best appreciated from the fact that, 
while in 1828 the number of stamps issued was 28 millions, in 
1836, 1843, 1845 and 1846 the figures, were 42, 61, 65 and 79 
millions respectively. At the last-mentioned date the papers 
with a circulation of upwards of io,coo were (besides the Moni- 
teur, of which the circulation was chiefly official and gratuitous) 
as follows: Le Sibcle, 31,000; La Presse and Le Conslitulionnel, 
between 20,000 and 25,000; Journal des Dibals and VEpoque, 
between 10,000 and 15,000. 

If we cast a retrospective glance at the general characteristics 
(1) of the newspaper press of France, and (2) of the legislation con- 
cerning it, between the respective periods of the devastating revolu- 
tion of I793 -I 794 an d the scarcely less destructive revolution of 
1848, it will be found that the years 1819, 1828, 1830 (July), and 1835 
(September) mark epochs full of jpregnant teaching upon our subject. 
We pass over, as already sufficiently indicated, the newspaper 
licence of the first-named years (1 793-1 794), carried to a pitch which 
became a disgrace to civilization, and the stern Napoleonic censor- 
ship which followed it — also carried to an excess, disgraceful, not, 
indeed, to civilization, but to the splendid intellect which had once 
given utterance to the words, " Physical discovery is a grand faculty 
of the human mind, but literature is the mind itself." 

The year 1819 is marked by a virtual cessation of the arbitrary 
power of suppression lodged till then in the government, and by the 
substitution of a graduated system of preliminary bondsand surety- 
ships (** cautipnnements ") on the one hand, and of strict penalties for 
convicted press-offences on the other. This initiatory amelioration 
of 1 819 became, in 1828, a measure of substantial yet regulated 
freedom, which for two years worked, in the main, alike with equity 
towards the just claims of journalism as a profession and with steady 
development towards the public of its capabilities as a great factor in 
the growth of civilization. Those tv/o years were followed by a 
widely contrasted period of five years. That was a term of entire 
liberty often grossly abused, and fitly ending with the just and 
necessary restrictions of September 1835. But that period of 1830- 
1835 was also signalized by some noble attempts to use the powers 
of the newspaper press for promoting the highest and the enduring 
interests of France. Not least memorable amongst these was the 

iVint enterprise of Montalembert and Lamcnnais — soon to be aided 
>y Lacordaire, — when, by the establishment (October 1830) of the 
newspaper VAvenir, they claimed for the church of France " her 
just part in the liberties acquired by the country," and asserted for 
the sacred symbols of Christianity their lawful place, alike above 
the^ tricolor and above the lilies. ** Dieu et la libert6 " was the motto 
which Montalembert chose for his^ newspaper, as he had chosen it 
long before for the guiding star of his youthful aspirations. VAvenir 
existed only for one year and one month. It came to its early end 
from no lack of energy and patience in its writers, but in part from 
that mission of the editors to Rome (November 1831) which, 
at least for a time, necessitated the discontinuance of their news- 
paper. Human regrets had higher than human consolations. " Our 
labours " on VAvenir , wrote Montalembert, with simple truth, 
*' decided the attitude of Catholics in France and elsewhere, from the 
time of the July revolution to the time of the second empire." 

There were many other papers, at this time and afterwards, which, 
like VAvenir, were, in their degree, organs of ideas, not speculations 
of trade. But they cannot be even enumerated here. No very 
notable specially religious paper succeeded VAvenir until the founda- 
tion in 1843 — under widely different auspices, although twice at the 
outset the editorship was offered to Lacordaire — of VUnivers 
Religieux* That journal was edited, at first, by De Coux, then 
by Louis Veuillot; it underwent innumerable lawsuits, "warn- 
ings," suppressions and interdicts, for causes very diverse. Several 
prelates suppressed V Univers Religieux in their respective dioceses, 
amongst them the great bishop Dupanloup in that of Orleans (1853). 
Napoleon 111. suppressed it in 1861, permitted it to reappear as Le 
Monde, and suspended it many times afterwards; but it survived 
all its misfortunes for a good many years. ^ Le Monde had the curious 
fate, at^ one time, of being conducted jointly by the first editor of 
VAvenir, Lamennais, and by George Sand, who had previously 
figured in the newspaper annals of France as co-foundress of 
V&laireur de VIndre, a journal published at Orleans. The account 
given by that brilliant writer of her adventures in what wasthen to 
her a new department of activity is an instructive one. With that 
breadth of sympathy which was so characteristic of her, she strove 
to interest all her friends (however varied in character, as in rank) 
in the enterprise. There is, perhaps, scarcely anything more amusing 
in French journalistic annals than is her (contemporary) account of 
the first meeting of the shareholders — at which, she tells us, about 
five hundred resolutions were moved for the guidance of the editor 
at his desk. 

The impulse given to the growth of advertisements in the days 
which followed July 1830, became, as the years rolled on, sufficiently 
developed to induce the formation of a company — in which one of 
the Laffittcs took part — to farm them, 1 at a yearly rent of £12,000 

	1 Or, to speak more precisely, to farm a certain conspicuous page 
	of each newspaper, in perpetuity. 

sterling (300,000 francs), so far (at first) as regarded the four leading 
journals (DSbats, Constitutional, Steele, Presse), to which were after- 
wards added two others (Le Pays and La Patrie). The combina- 
tion greatly embarrassed advertisers, first, since its great aim was to 
force them either to advertise in all, whether addressing the classes 
intended to be canvassed or not, or else to pay for each advertisement 
in a selected newspaper the price of many proffered advertisements 
in all the papers collectively, and, secondly, because by many repeti- 
tions in certain newspapers no additional publicity was really gamed, 
two or three of the favoured journals circulating for the main amongst 
the same class of buyers. La France was then the newspaper of the 
Conservative aristocracy of the nation ; Le Monde and the Union 
more especially addressed the clergy; the Dtbats and the Temps were 
the journals of the uppermercantilc class, the Sibcle and L f Opinion 
of the lower or shopkeeping class. A man who asked to advertise 
briefly, in the Steele, for example, alone, was charged 2 francs for each 
several insertion. If he went the round of the six, his advertisement 
cost him only 75 centimes per journal, for ten successive insertions 
in each of them, all round. 

To a great extent, the inundation of newspapers which followed 
the revolution of February 1848 was but a parody on the revolu- 
tionary press of 179^. Most of them, of course, had very 
short lives. When Cavaignac took the helm he suppressed rinvuv 
eleven journals, including La Presse and VAssembUe *^ y * 
Nationale. The former had at this period a circulation of nearly 
70,000, and its proprietor, in a petition to the National Assembly, 
declared that it gave subsistence to more than one thousand persons, 
and was worth in the market at least 1 ,500,000 francs. In August the 
system of sureties was restored. On the 13th June 1849 the president 
of the republic suspended Le Peuple, La Revolution DSmoeratique et 
Soeiale, La Vraie Rtpublique, La Dimoeratie Pacifique, La Reforme 
and La Tribune des Peuples. On July 16, 1850, the assembly passed 
what is called the " L01 Tinguy * (from the name of the otherwise 
obscure deputy who proposed it), by which the author of every news- 
paper article on any subject, political, philosophical or religious, 
was bound to affix his name to it, on penalty of a fine of 500 francs 
for the first offence, and of 1000 francs for its repetition. Every 
false or feigned signature was to be punished by a fine of 1000 francs, 
" together with six months' imprisonment, both for the author and 
the editor." The practical working of this law lay in the creation of 
a new functionary in the more important newspaper offices, who was 
called " secretaire de la redaction," and was, in fact, the scapegoat 
ex officio. The " Loi Tinguy," though now long repealed, has had a 
permanent influence on French journalism in the continued preval- 
ence of signed articles, and the consequent prominence of individual 
writers as compared with the same class of work in other countries. 
In February 1852 all the press laws were incorporated, with increased 
stringency, into a " Decret organique sur la presse." The stamp duty 
for each sheet was fixed at 6 centimes, within certain dimensions, 
and a proportional increase in case of excess. 

In 1858 the order of the six leading Parisian papers in point of 
circulation was— (1) Steele, (2) Presse, (3) Constitutional, (4) Patrie, 
(5) Debats, (6) Assembled Nationale. The number of provincial 
papers exceeded five hundred. ** Newspapers, nowadays, wrote a 
keenly observant publicist in that year, arc almanacs, bulletins, 
advertising mediums, rather than the guides and the centres of 
opinion." In 1866 the changehad become more marked still. The 
monetary success of Girardin's many commercial speculations in 
this branch of commerce greatly increased the number of Parisian 
journals, whilst lowering the status of those of established rank. 
The aggregate daily issue of the Parisian " dailies " had increased 
to about 350,000 copies, but the evening paper, Le Petit Moniteur, 
alone issued nearly 130,000 of these. The average circulation of 
Le Steele had fallen from 55,000 to 45,000 copies; that of La Patrie 
was reduced by one-half (32,000 to 16,000); that of Le Constitu- 
tional from 2£,ooo to 13,000; of VOpinion Nationale from 18,000 
to 15,000; whilst the chief journal of all — with grand antecedents 
and with a brilliant history of public service rendered — had for a 
time descended, it is said, from 12,000 copies to 9000. And yet 
almost over the whole of this very period the brilliant " Lundis " 
of Sainte-Beuvc were making their punctual appearance in Le 
Constitutionnel, to be presently continued in Le Moniteur and in 
Le Temps; and writers like St Marc Girardin, Cuvillier-Fleury, and 
Pr6vost-ParadolJwere constantly writing in the Journal des Debats. 
Meanwhile, Villcmessant and his colleagues were making their 
fortunes out of Le Figaro (begun 1854, but a daily from 1866), and 
helping to make frivolous petty ** paragraphs " on matters of 
literature almost everywhere take the place of able and well-elabor- 
ated articles. Well might Albert Sorcl say, 2 "Our trumpery news- 
papers are the newspapers that pay." In 1872 the circulation of Le 
Petit Journal (founded 1863), the pioneer of the French halfpenny 
press, was 212,500, and it went on rapidly increasing. ^ 

No incident in the newspaper history of this period made more 
temporary noise than did the strange charges brought in 1867 against 
the Dibats, the Steele and VOpinion Nationale, by M. Kervegucn, 
member for Toulon, in the French assembly. He charged them 

	* When comparing the French newspaper press as it stood in 1873.

	Presse Allcmandc," vol. ii. of 1873, p. 715. 

collectively with receiving bribes, both from the government of 
Prussia and from that of Italy— upon the faith, as it afterwards 
appeared, of statements made by another newspaper, not of France 
but of Belgium, La Finance. An elaborate inquiry, presided over 
by M Berrver, pronounced the accusation to be absolutely ground- 
less. Yet it was soon revived by Le Pays, in the shape of a specific 
charge against an individual editor of Le Steele—- La Varenne. 
All that was eventually proved, in due course of law, was merely 
the agency in Paris of La Varenne for the Italian government, at 
a time prior to the events of 1866. 

In 1874 an elaborate return showed that in thirty-five principal 
towns of France, comprising a population of 2,566,000, their re- 
spective journals had an aggregate weekly issue of 2,800,000 copies. 

In 1878 the total number of journals of all kinds published in 
France was 2200. Of these 150 were political, strictly speaking, of 
which Paris published 49. Of Parisian journals other than political 
there were 1141 (including 71 religious, ioa legal, 153 commercial, 
134 technological, 98 scientific and medical, 59 artistic). At that 
date Le Figaro had a circulation of about 70,000, Le Petit Journal 
(at a halfpenny) one of about 650,000. 

The principal Parisian newspapers in 1883 may be classified thus — 

(a) Organs of the Legitimists and of the Church of France: 
Gazette de France, Le Monde, V Union, La Defense, La Civilisation, 
V Univers. 

(b) Orleanist organs: Le Moniteur Universel, Le Constitutional, 
Le Francois (under the auspices of the Due de Broglie), Le Soleil. 

(c) Bonapartist organ: Le Pays (edited at one time by La- 
martine). 

(d) Republican organs: Journal des DSbats, Le Temps (founded 
1861, with the title of the earlier Temps of 1829-1842), Le Steele, 
Le XIX. Steele, Le Paix, La Justice, Paris, La Ripublique Francaise 
(founded in 1871 by Gambetta), Le Parlement (founded by Dufaure), 
the Socialist La Petite Republique (1875). 

The law concerning the liberty of the press, of July 29, 1881, 
abolished suretyship for newspapers, and transferred their registra- 
tion from the ministry of justice at Paris to the local representative 
of the attorney-general (Je parquet) in each town respectively. It 
made the establishment of a newspaper virtually free, upon legal 
deposit of two copies, and upon due registration of each newspaper 
under the simple guarantee of a registered director, French by birth, 
responsible in case of libel. And it took away the former discretion- 
ary power, lodged in the home office, of interdicting the circulation 
in France of foreign journals. The home minister might still pro- 
hibit a single number of a newspaper; only the whole council of 
ministers, duly convened, could prohibit the circulation of a foreign 
newspaper absolutely. 1 

The newspapers of Paris, and similarly of France, practically 
doubled in number between 1880 and 1900. In 1880 there 
were about 120 Paris newspapers, in 1890 about 
*i* ter fo 160, and in 1900 about 240. The total number of 
meats!' newspapers, as distinguished from periodicals, pub- 
lished in France during 1900 was in round numbers 
2400. Of these, about 2160 appeared in 540 provincial towns. 

The history of the French press during the last twenty years 
of the 19th century followed very closely that of the country 
itself, Boulangist and an ti -Boulangist, Dreyfusist or anti- 
Dreyfusist, Republican or Nationalist; finally it became either 
Moderate Republican or Radical-Socialist with a sprinkling 
of Nationalist organs and a small minority of Royalist and 
Bonapartist sheets. 

At the head of the Moderate" Republican organs were Le 
Temps and Le Journal des Dibats among the evening papers, 

	1 The history of French journals published abroad is interesting. 
	The Annates politiques of Linguet — for a time of Linguet and Mallet 
	du Pan jointly — was, from about 1770 to about 1785, almost a 
	power in Europe, in its way. Mallet du Pan's own Mercure Briton- 
	nique, during the eventful years 1798-1800, was brilliant, sagacious 
	and honest. When the pen literally fell from his dying hand — a 
	hand that had kept its integrity under the pains of exile and of bitter 
	poverty — that pen was taken up (for a short interval) by Malouet. 
	When Napoleon forcibly suppressed, a little later, the Courrier de 
	V Europe of the count of Montlosier, he offered the deprived editor a 
	pension, which was refused, until accompanied by the offer of a post 
	in which the able minister of Louis XVI. could still work for his 
	country. 

	English^ journalism in France was for long associated with 
	Gahgnant s Messenger, started by Giovanni Antonio Galignani (1757- 
	1822) in 1814, and turned into a daily just before his death. Its 
	palmy days were between 1814 and 1848. In 1895 it was turned into 
	the Dotty Messenger, but proved a failure and was dropped in 1904; 
	it was really killed by the competition of the Paris edition of the 
	Mew York Herald. It had been preceded by Sampson Perry's Arms 
	J1809), , a Napoleonic organ. In May 1905 a new era of English 
	journalism on the continent began by the institution of the Paris 
	edition of the London Daily Mail. 

and Le Figaro, Le Journal, Le Silcle, Le Petit Parisien and 
Le Petit Journal among the morning dailies. Le Figaro was 
until 1901 under the editorship of M. F. de Rodays, and the 
brilliant articles of M. J. Comely were one of the features of the 
paper; but a dispute among the proprietors in 1901 resulted 
in the dismissal of M. Comely and the retirement of M. de 
Rodays. M. Jean Dupuy (a member of the Waldeck-Rousseau 
government) was the proprietor and editor of Le Petit Parisien, 
a popular organ almost rivalling Le Petit Journal; the circula- 
tion of the latter had, however, reached over one million and a 
quarter copies daily. 

Le Matin and L' Eclair, among the Moderate Republican 
organs, gave less attention to the discussion of political questions 
from the party point of view than to the collection of news, 
and they were followed by the £cho de Paris (1884). Le Matin, 
which also dates from 1884, was from its origin essentially 
what is called in France a journal d' informations, publishing 
every morning a mass of telegraphic news from all countries. 
By an arrangement with the London Times, it gave every 
day a translation of most of the telegrams published in that 
newspaper. T/ 

In April 1901 the proprietorship of Le Silcle was changed, 
in consequence of the lack of support given by Parisian readers 
to that journal as edited by M. Yves Guyot (formerly minister 
of public works). The latter was a staunch free-trader, a 
courageous defender of Captain Dreyfus, and an eloquent 
advocate of a good understanding between France and England; 
he emphatically endorsed the British policy in South Africa, 
and tried to explain it to his countrymen. The paper was, 
however, bought in by a number of friends of M. Yves Guyot, 
who remained as editor. The greatest opponent of Yves Guyot 
from the economic point of view was Jules Meline, also a former 
minister, whose paper, La Republique, was the recognized organ 
of Protectionism. . * * \^Ji 

The Radical and Socialist ideas which in latter years made 
such progress in France were very ably advocated by several 
newspapers whose influence steadily grew, such as UAurore, 
La Lanterne and UHumanite* (the organ of Jean Jaures). 
Such Individual organs of opinion must also be mentioned as 
V Intransigent, the organ of Henri Rochefort, and M. 
Clemenceau's organ, Le Bloc, in which he advocated the practical 
application of all of the revolutionary republican principles, 
pure and unadulterated, forming a whole (bloc), no part of which 
could or ought to be sacrificed to temporary political necessities. 

As an intermediate link between the Republican organs 
of all shades and the various Monarchist newspapers, came 
the so-called Nationalist press, an offshoot of or successor to 
the Boulangist press of the preceding decade. As were the 
Boulangists, so were the Nationalists, a sort of syndicat des 
me* contents, their chief organs being La Pairie, edited by M. 
Millevoye, and La Cocarde; these papers represented the views 
of those who had vague hankerings after a different rSgtme and 
a decided hostility towards the republican form of government. 

There was a considerable diminution of influence in the 
Monarchist press. Le Soleil, however, had a large circle of readers 
among the Conservative bourgeoisie with Orleanist leanings. - 
Le Gaulois remained a Royalist paper of somewhat doubtful 
tendencies, the editor, M. Arthur Meyer, having incurred the 
displeasure of the Pretender whose cause he defended. Of the 
old Legitimist press there remained the old Gazette de France, 
which was founded in 1631 and had Still a diminishing band of 
faithful readers. The organ of the religious (Roman Catholic) 
associations in France, La Croix, founded in 1880, represented 
the views of the French religious associations, and discussed all 
questions from the point of view of Catholic interests. La 
Croix was published in Paris, but had in the provinces one hundred 
and four local weekly supplements to the Paris edition, each 
one taking its name from the parent journal and adding to it 
the name of the department or locality in which it was printed, 
such as La Croix de VAllier, La Croix de Lyon. 

The French papers, of whatever party, took an increased 
interest during this period in foreign matters, and much improved 
their organization for collecting news. Some of them, in fact, 
were almost exclusively news-sheets, and the journal d'informa- 
tions — Le Matin or U Eclair, for instance — took its place beside 
the journal properly so called, more perhaps as a rival than as a 
complement. The natural result followed, and the more old- 
type newspapers took steps to provide their readers with news 
as well as with leading articles, current and literary topics, 
society gossip, dramatic criticism and law reports. The most 
remarkable as well as perhaps the earliest attempt to enlarge 
the scope of Parisian newspapers was made in 1893 by Georges 
Patinot, editor of the Journal des Dtbats. Instead of one edition, 
that newspaper published two entirely distinct editions, a morning 
one and an evening one. After some time the plucky attempt 
had to be given up, and the Journal des Dibats became an 
evening paper. The bold experiment made by the Journal 
des Debats (which celebrated its centenary in 1889) led the other 
newspapers to find a happy mean between a four-page paper 
published twice a day and an eight-page paper on the pattern 
of English newspapers, and the result was that now most great 
daily papers in Paris came out with six pages, the Figaro giving 
the lead. As French newspapers increased in size they reduced 
their price. Most six-page newspapers, with the exception of 
Le Figaro, were by 1902 sold at 5 centimes, and the price of 
15 centimes, which used to be the rule, became the exception. 
In 1902 60 Paris papers (daily and weekly) were sold at 5 centimes 
and 51 at 10 centimes, whilst only 11 cost 1.5 centimes. In 1880 
only 23 were 5-centime papers and 24 were 10-centime papers. 

The American style of journalism came into vogue in Paris 
in the 'eighties, and " interviews " were frequent; but the 
general tendency of Parisian editors was to adopt the English 
compromise, and to eschew any extreme sensational methods. 
Most of the important Parisian newspapers had their special 
correspondents in the great capitals of Europe, London, Berlin, 
St Petersburg, Vienna and Rome. Nothing perhaps was so 
striking after 1890 as the demand of the French public for foreign 
and colonial news, or the readiness of the papers to supply it 
by means of special representatives independent of the news 
agencies. 

In home matters the French press made greater progress still 
in the rapid and accurate collection of news, and in this respect 
the provincial press showed more enterprise and more ability 
than that of Paris. Its development was remarkable, for whereas 
in 1880 the inhabitants of the departments had to await the 
arrival of the Parisian papers for their news, they now had the 
advantage of being supplied every morning with local newspapers 
inferior to none of the best organs of Paris. Among the best 
provincial papers may be mentioned La Gironde and La Petite 
Gironde of Bordeaux, La Diplche of Toulouse, Le Lyon Ri- 
publicain, Uftcho du Nord of Lille, Le Journal de Rouen, all 
having a staff in Paris engaged in collecting news, reporting 
parliamentary proceedings and law cases, telegraphed or tele- 
phoned during the night and published early the next morning 
in tneir respective localities. Being perfectly independent 
ot purely Parisian opinion or even bias, the decentralization of 
the French provincial press became complete. The newspapers 
of the large towns circulated not only in the city in which they 
were printed but throughout the region of which it was the centre. 
Thus the Deptche of Toulouse, with its twelve editions daily, 
was read in the whole of the departments extending from the 
Lot to the Pyrenees, whilst the Petite Gironde was found in all 
south-western France. The influence of the provincial, as of the 
Paris, press became so great that, as M. Avenel says in his book 
on the French press, there came a tendency to resent its omni- 
potence. The power of the newspaper in France differs from 
that of the English newspaper, in that it seems to act more on 
the government and the parliament than on public opinion. 
The French newspapers have taken upon themselves, in many 
cases, functions which belong more properly to the legislative 
or to the judicial power than to the press, and the result has not 
always been successful. The cause of this is that too many men 
of talent with political ambition look upon journalism as " leading 
to everything, provided one gets out of it." and use it alternately

as an antechamber of parliament or of the cabinet, and a lounge 
during their parliamentary or ministerial eclipses.

5. Newspapers of Germany 
Printed newspapers in Germany begin with the Frankfurter 
Journal, established in 161 5 by Egenolph Emmel, a bookseller 
of Frankfort-on-Main. The following year saw the foundation 
of the Frankfurter Oberpostamtszeitung — continued until the 
year 1 866 as Frankfurter Postzeitung. Fulda appears to have been 
the next German town to possess a newspaper, then Hildesheim 
(1619) and Herford (1630). In the course of the century almost 
all German cities of the first rank possessed their respective 
journals. The earliest in Leipzig bears the date 1660. The 
Rostocker Zeitung was founded in 1710. The Hamburgischer 
Correspondent (1714) was originally published under the name 
of Holsteiniscke Zeitungs-Correspondenz, two years earlier, and 
was almost the only German newspaper which really drew its 
foreign news from " our own correspondent." Berlin had in the 
18th century two papers, those of Voss (the Vossische Zeitung,- 
1722) and of J. K. P. Spener (1 740-1 827; the Spener'sche 
Zeitung, or Berlinische Nachrichten, 1772). Some half-dozen 
papers which glimmered in the surrounding darkness were the 
reservoirs whence the rest replenished their little lamps. On the 
whole, it may be said that the German newspapers were of very 
small account until after the outbreak of the French Revolution. 
Meanwhile the MS. news-letters, as in earlier days, continued to 
enjoy a large circulation in Germany. Many came from London. 
The correspondence, for instance, known under the name of 
" Mary Pinearis " — that, apparently, of a French refugee 
settled in London — had a great German circulation between 
1725 and 1735. Another series was edited by the Cologne 
gazetteer, Jean Ignace de Roderique, also a French refugee, and 
remembered as the subject of a characteristic despatch from 
Frederick II. of Prussia to his envoy in that city, enclosing 100 
ducats to be expended in hiring a stout fellow with a cudgel to 
give a beating to the gazetteer as the punishment of an offensive 
paragraph. 1 The money, it seems, was earned, for Roddrique 
was well-nigh killed. At Berlin itself, Franz Hermann Ortgies 
carried on a brisk trade in these news-letters (1728-1735), 
until he too came under displeasure on account of them, was 
kept in prison several months, and then exiled for life. 2 Nor, 
indeed, can any journal of a high order be mentioned of prior 
appearance to the Allgemeine Zeitung, founded at Leipzig by 
the bookseller Cotta (at first under the title of Neueste Weltkunde) 
in 1798. Posselt was its first editor, but his want of nerve — and 
perhaps his weak health — hindered the application of his high 
powers to political journalism. His articles, too, gave offence 
to the Austrian court, and the paper had to change both its 
title and its place of publication. It had been commenced at 
Tubingen, and removed to Stuttgart; it was now transferred 
to Ulm, and again to Augsburg. It was Cotta's aim to make this 
the organ of statesmen and publicists, to reach the public through 
the thinkers, to hold an even balance between the rival parties 
of the day, and to provide a trustworthy magazine of materials 
for the historians to come; and, in the course of time, his plan 
was so worked out as to raise the Allgemeine Zeitung into European 
fame. Cotta was also the founder, at various periods, of the 
Morgenblatt, which became famous for its critical ability and 
tact, of Vesperus, of Das Inland, of Nemesis, of the Oppositions- 
blatt of Weimar (for a time edited by Bertuch), and even of the 
Archives Parisiennes. 

Whilst French influence was dominant in Germany, the 
German papers were naturally little more than echoes of the 
Parisian press. But amidst the excitements of the " war of 

	1 Fr. Kapp, " Berliner geschriebene Zeitungen," in Deutsche Rund- 
	schau, xxi. 107-122 (1879), citing Droysen, Zeitschr. f. preuss. Gesch.

	on Carlyle's praise of Frederick's love of the liberty of the press. ' 

	2 Kapp, ut supra. 

liberation " a crowd of new journals appeared. Niebuhr started 
a Preussischer Correspondent; Gorrcs — who in 1798 had founded 
at Coblentz Das rothe Blatt, soon suppressed by the invading 
French — undertook the Rheiniseher Mercur (January 1814 to 
January 1816), which was suppressed by the Prussian govern- 
ment, under Von Hardenberg. This journal, during its initiatory 
year, had the honour of being termed by Napoleon — perhaps 
satirically — " the fifth power of Europe." Wetzel, somewhat 
later, founded the Fr&nkischer Mercur, published at Bamberg, 
and Friedrich Seybold the N eckarzeitung. Some of these journals 
lasted but two or three years. Most of the survivors fell victims 
to that resolution of the diet (20th September 1819) which 
subjected the newspaper press, even of countries where the 
censorship had been formally abolished, to police superintendence 
of a very stringent kind. 
The aspirations for some measure of freedom which burst 
forth again under the influences of 1830 led to the establishment 
of such papers as Siebenpfeiffer's Westbote, Lohbauer's Hoch- 
wackter, Wirth's Deutsche Tribune, Eisenmann's Baierisches 
Volksblatt, Der Freisinnige of Rotteck and Welcker, and many 
more of much freer utterance than had been heard before in 
Germany. This led, in the ordinary course, to new declarations in 
the diet against the licence and revolutionary tendencies of the 
press, and to " regulations " of a kind which will be sufficiently 
indicated by the mention of one, in virtue whereof no editor of 
a suppressed journal could undertake another journal, during 
the space of five years, within any part of Germany. It need 
hardly be added that few of the newspapers of 1830 saw the 
Christmas of 1832. Very gradually some of the older journals 
— and amongst the number the patriarch of all, the Frank- 
furter Oberpostatntszeitung — plucked up courage enough to speak 
out a little; and some additional newspapers were again 
attempted. Amongst those which acquired deserved influence 
were Brockhaus's Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung, the advocate 
of free trade and of a moderate liberalism, possessing a large 
circulation in northern Germany (1837); the Deutsche Zeitung, 
edited by Gervinus, at Heidelberg (July 1847); and the Dorf- 
zeitung, published at Hildburghausen. The stirring events of 
1848 called forth in Germany, as in so many other countries, a 
plentiful crop of political instructors of the people, many of 
whom manifestly lacked even the capacity to learn, and vanished 
almost as suddenly as they had appeared. But it is undeniable 
that a marked improvement in the ability and energy of the 
German political press may be dated from this period. 

At the beginning of the 20th century the position and influence 
of the German press were passing through a period of- change. 
The Germans had become a newspaper-reading people. Indeed, 
with the remarkable growth of the commercial spirit in Germany 
there had simultaneously been a change in the intellectual 
attitude and habits of the mass of the nation. The German of 
" the great period " of 1866 and 1870 derived his knowledge of 
his own and other countries to a very great extent from the more 
or less intelligent study of books, pamphlets and magazines. 
The busy German of the opening years of the 20th century had 
become almost as much the slave of his newspaper as the average 
American. Berlin in 1900 had 45 dailies, Leipzig 8, Munich 12, 
Hamburg 11, Stuttgart 8, Strassburg 6. In the domains both 
of home and of foreign politics the result was often a chaos of 
crude opinions and impulses, the strata of which were only 
differentiated by certain permanent tendencies of German 
political thought based upon tradition, class feeling, material 
interests, or distinctions of religious creed. In these circum- 
stances it was still possible for the government, as in the days of 
Prince Bismarck and Dr Moritz Busch, to bring its superior 
knowledge to bear upon the anarchy of public sentiment through 
the medium of the inspired (or as it used to be called, the " rep- 
tile ") press, but this operation had now to be performed with 
greater delicacy and skill. The press had begun to feel its power. 
It was at least able to drive a bargain with those who would 
officially control it, and it was conscious in its relations with the 
authorities that the advantage no longer rested exclusively on 
the side of the latter. It would be instructive to compare, with 
the aid of Dr Busch's " Secret Pages " of the history" of Prince 
Bismarck, the methods by which the first Chancellor used to 
create and control a movement of public opinion with the devices 
by which, for instance, count von Biilow and his subordinates 
endeavoured to manage the, press of a later day. The journalists 
who placed themselves at the disposal of Prince Bismarck were 
mostly treated as his menials; as he himself said, " Decent 
people do not write for me." Count von BUlow's methods, and 
to a certain extent those of his predecessor, Prince Hohenlohe, 
moved on somewhat different fines. These methods might be 
characterized as the psychological treatment of the individual 
journalist, .the endeavour to appeal to his personal vanity or to 
his legitimate ambition, and only in a minor degree to his fear 
of the dossier, the public prosecutor, and the official boycott. 
There was also a further development of Prince Bismarck's 
system of acknowledging the existence of political and social 
movements the origin of which was wholly or partially inde- 
pendent. As in Bismarck's time, the tendencies of these move- 
ments were carefully observed, and they were turned to account 
where they seemed capable of subserving the main objects of 
state policy. Thus at the opening of the century the pro-Boer 
and agrarian movements were both employed in support of 
German foreign and colonial policy, and of an elaborate scheme 
of naval construction; while the growth of the commercial 
spirit on the one hand and the awakening of the lower middle 
classes on the other, were pressed into the service of \V elt-pdlitik 
and of its auxiliary — a system of protective tariffs. It required 
no small skill to bring into line and to hold together the various 
classes and interests from time to time arrayed in the press in 
support of German foreign policy. The organs of the govern- 
ment in the press were the sheep-dogs which held the flock 
together. 

The German journals of which foreigners hear most belong with 
few exceptions to the daily press of Berlin. There are, however, 
one or two provincial or non-Prussian newspapers which from time 
to time enjoy more careful inspiration from the government offices 
than any of their Berlin contemporaries. There is, for example, the 
Cologne Gazette (Kolnische Zeitung, 1848), of which Prince Bismarck 
once said that it was " worth an army corps on the Rhine." It is 
difficult to trace all the channels by which information is^ conveyed 
to an organ of this kind, but there have undoubtedly been times when 
leading articles and entre-filets in the Rhenish organ were virtually or 
actually written in the German Foreign Office. Indeed, the methods 
of the institution which has been called the " Press Bureau," but 
which in the realm of foreign policy at least represented no concrete 
organization, have been so numerous and varied that it would be 
hopeless for any one except the most practised observer to trace their 
manifestations. The advantage of a semi-official press, if it could be 
manipulated with unvarying success, is that it can easily be dis- 
avowed when the suggestions, overtures or menaces of which it has 
been the exponent have served their turn or have become inexpedient. 
Thus during the blockade of Manila in 1898 the Cologne Gazette gave 
all the prominence of its first column and of leaded type to an article 
taken from the Marine Politische Korrespondenz, which practically 
warned the United States of the intention of Germany to have a 
share in the Pacific possessions of Spain if these should eventually 
change hands. Some ten days later the authority of this menace was 
explicitly disavowed by the North German Gazette, which announced 
that the Marine Politische Korrespondenz had never possessed a 
semi-official character. .The Cologne Gazette continued in the west of 
Germany to serve the German government much as it did in the 
time of Prince Bismarck, although for prudential reasons its inspira- 
tion became on the whole more intermittent than it was in the days 
of the first Chancellor. The Hamburgischer Correspondent, the lead- 
ing Hamburg journal, played a minor r61e of the same nature in the 
chief Hanseatic port, while the Hamburger Naxhrichten, celebrated 
especially during the exile of Prince Bismarck and the closing years 
of his life at Friedrichsruh as the receptacle of indiscreet revelations 
and violent attacks upon his successors, almost lost all significance 
except as a local organ of violent Anglophobia. The Allgemeine 
Zeitung of Munich, once famous throughout Europe as the Augs- 
burger Allgemeine Zeitung before its transference to the Bavarian 
capital, became in the hands of new proprietors practically an organ 
of the imperial Chancellor. In Prince Bismarck's days the press 
bureau of the Prussian Ministry of the Interior, and a similar organ- 
ization in the Imperial Home Office, used to furnish hundreds of oetty 
local newspapers known as Kreis-blatter with whole articles gratis, so 
that the policy of the government might be advocated in every nook 
and corner of the country. The numerous journals in which these 
communications used to appear simultaneously and in an identical 
form were the government organs to which the Radical and Socialist 
opposition more particularly applied the term " Reptile Press.'* 
Later this practice of wholesale inspiration was abandoned, but 
there remained many channels, public and private, through which 
almost every department of the government could communicate 
information and guidance to newspapers in all parts of Germany. 
The Prussian Ministry of the Interior distributed to all and sundry 
a news-letter known as the Berliner Korrespondenz, professing only 
to give statistics and information, and to correct erroneous statements, 
but also frequently containing articles advocating some proposal of 
the government or combating the arguments of its opponents. 
The Sud-Deutsclie Reichs-Korrespondenz had a similar character, and 
in 1902 served as an exponent of the policy and tactics of the imperial 
Chancellor, count von Biilow. Almost every one of the political 
parties has its Korrespondenz (or news-letter) supplying views rather 
than news. These circular letters deal, in fact, with the policy of the 
party with which they are associated, although they occasionally 
also embody information which the party leaders in the Reichstag or 
in the Prussian Diet have received from representatives of the 
government for their own guidance. They form the means of hold- 
ing the parties together, and of inspiring them with common aims, as 
they are reproduced throughout the country by all the party organs. 

It was in the press of Berlin that the greatest changes took place 
towards the end of the 19th century. During the regime of Prince 
Bismarck the North German Gazette, and occasionally the Post, 
used to keep Europe in a state of nervous tension by fulminant com- 
munique's which the great Chancellor himself often dictated, or by 
what lie used to call " jets of cold water " (Kaltwasserstrahl), which 
were mostly directed against France or Russia. So far as France arid 
Russia are concerned, a much more pacific tone prevailed in Berlin 
after the conclusion of the Dual Alliance, and it was upon England 
that the press mainly concentrated its attacks. The North German 
Gazette, which was originally established by a private individual, in 
order " to place a blank sheet of paper at the disposal of Prince 
Bismarck," became on the whole, a mere record of home news and 
a summary of foreign intelligence bearing the semi-official stamp 
of Wolff's Telegraph Agency. It had doubtless been found that 
the constant employment of an organ so distinctly official as the 
Norddeutsche Allgemeine as a medium of expression for the views of 
the government was apt to lead to indiscretions which committed 
the authorities too deeply. Indeed, immediately before Prince 
Bismarck's fall he had actually employed this journal in order to 
attack the labour policy of the emperor. Official communications 
still continued to appear in the North German Gazette, but mostly 
characterized by a vagueness and awkwardness of style in striking 
contrast to the force and point of Prince Bismarck's polemics. The 
Imperial Gazette (Reichsanzeiger) , corresponding to the London 
Gazette, is purely a record of official intelligence, though on rare 
occasions it publishes in the section marked Nicht Amtlich (non- 
official), some dementi, some statement of^ policy or some official 
document — a proceeding which always requires the express sanction 
of the emperor. 

The journals which in 1880 were most widely read in Berlin, and 
which were best known abroad as the exponents of Berlin opinion, 
were the Liberal or Radical Vossische Zeitung and Berliner Tageblatt, 
and the National Liberal National Zeitung. The Vossische Zeitung, 
the oldest of all the Berlin newspapers, written with a degree of 
literary ability which justified its real title, Koniglich privtligierte 
Berlinische Zeitung fur Staats- und Gelehrtensachen, held its place. 
The National Zeitung, however (founded in 1848 by Bernhard Wolff, 
the originator of Wolff's news agency), which represented as long as it 
could those vestiges of old German Liberalism which survived in the 
National Liberal party, was compelled to come to an end on January 
1st, 1905. The Kreuz Zeitung represented the " small but mighty 
party " of the reactionary Conservatives and Agrarians in the state, 
and of the orthodox (Lutheran) Protestants in the Church. It was 
the favourite journal of officers in the army, of the (Conservative 
gentry (Junker), as well as the medium through which people of 
social standing preferred to announce births, marriages and deaths. 
The Post continued to be subsidized by a small number of industrial 
and rural ^ magnates in the interests of the Reichspartei, or Free 
Conservative party, which for the most part subordinated its views 
to those of the government. The Berliner Neueste Nachrichten, like 
the Post, was a consistent advocate of the development of the German 
navy and of a vigorous Welt-politik. The Boersen Zeitung and the 
Boersen- Courier were organs of the Berlin Stock Exchange; the 
first of a National Liberal colour, and the other expressing the views 
of the Moderate Radicals (Freisinnige Vereinigung) and of opponents 
of extreme protection. The Vorwarts was the central organ of the 
German Social- Democrats, who had established a considerable 
number of other journals throughout Germany. The clericals or 
Centre party were represented by the Germania, less influential than 
the other leading organ of the Roman Catholic " governing party," 
the Kolnische Volks-zeitung. The Deutsche Tageszeitung ^ made 
itself a name by its advocacy of the agrarian movement, while the 
Freisinnige Zeitung (founded!, and to a great extent edited, by the 
Radical leader Eugen Richter) represented the Radical point of view. 
Among the provincial papers the Frankfurter Zeitung (Radical) was 
distinguished by the excellence of its news t especially on commercial 
subjects. The Schlesische Zeitung (1752) a leading Conservative 
organ, had continued to appear in Breslau since the days of Frederick 
the Great. The Magdeburger Zeitung and the Hannover sche Courier 
gave an independent or National Liberal support to the government. 
The Weser Zeitung, published at Bremen, was an exponent of the 
Liberalism of the commercial classes, while the Strassburger Post was 
one of the journals which enjoyed government inspiration, and 
helped to maintain die Wacht am Rhein. A considerable number of 
journals, published in the Polish language, advocated the Polish cause 
in the eastern provinces of Prussia. 

Great success attended a new departure in German journalism, 
represented by newspapers like the Berlin Lokal-Anzeiger, describing 
themselves as non -political. The Lokal-Anzeiger, founded by 
August Scherl, who had gained his journalistic experience in America, 
had a circulation in Germany comparable with that of the Petit 
Journal in France, and it exercised a very marked influence upon 
public opinion in Berlin. 

The external form and arrangement of German newspapers is 
often puzzling at first sight to an English reader. There is an 
absence of the striking headlines, which in English journals direct 
attention to news of importance, and which in America almost swamp 
the text. The outside page generally contains the editorial articles 
and the news of most importance, while the intelligence received 
immediately before going to press is placed in the last column of the 
last sheet. The bulk- of the paper can apparently be increased in- 
definitely in accordance with the supply of news or literary matter, 
or with the number of advertisements. The Vossische Zeitung on a 
Sunday morning assumes, with its numerous supplementary sheets, 
the dimensions of a thick Blue-book. The quantity of extraneous 
matter, such as articles on literary, social and technical subjects, is 
enormous, and even the most serious political journals invariably 
publish a novel in serial form, as well as numerous novelettes and 
sketches. The local news in Berlin and other large cities is written 
with the minuteness and the familiarity of style of a village chronicle, 
and gives the impression that every one is occupied in observing the 
doings of his neighbour. The signed article is very much in vogue, 
and most wrkers and salaried correspondents have at least a cypher or 
initial by which they are distinguished. The greatest licence prevails 
in reporting and discussing the affairs of other countries, combined 
with the keenest sensitiveness to foreign criticism of anything that 
concerns Germany. The example of the government is followed in 
advertising the products of German industry, while those of foreigners 
are studiously depreciated. 

6. Other European Countries 
Austria-Hungary. — At the beginning of 1840 the whole number of 
Austro-German and Hungarian periodicals, of all sorts, was less than 
100, only 22 being (after a fashion) political newspapers; and of 
these nearly all drew their materials and their inspiration from the 
official papers of Vienna (Wiener Zeitung and Oesterreichischer 
Beobachter). These two were all that appeared in the capital. 
Agram, Pesth, Pressburg, Lemberg and Prague had also two each; 
but no other city had more than a single journal. In 1846 the 
aggregate number of periodicals had grown to 155, of which 46 
were political, but political only in the character of mere conduit- 
pipes for intelligence " approved of " by the government. In 1855 
the number of political papers published throughout the entire 
territory under Austrian government, the Italian provinces excepted, 
was 60. .The Neue Freie Presse, the chief Vienna daily, was founded 
in 1864.* In 1873, ten years after the virtual cessation of a very 
strict censorship, the number of political journals, including all the 
specifically administrative organs, as well local as general, was 267, 
and that of mere advertising papers 42; in 1883 the former number 
had increased to about 280, the latter to about 60. Vienna had in 
1883 in all 18 daily newspapers, ten of which ranged in average 
circulation from 14,000 to 54,000 copies. 

In the period from 1880 to 1888 the only notable paper founded in 
Austria, was the Wiener Allgemeine Zeitung (1880). It appeared 
three times daily, but in spite of the impetus communicated: to its 
start by the well-known " Freilands " Apostle Theodor Hertzka, it 
soon fell away, and eventually became simply a late evening paper, 
known as the 6 Uhr AbendblatL It was with the rise of the anti- 
Semitic and Socialistic movements of 1888 onwards that the Vienna 
daily press first began a fresh increase. The Deutsche Volksblatt 
(anti-Semitic) was founded in 1888, the Ostdeutsche Rundschau 
(Radical) in 1893, and the Reichspost (theorgan of the Catholic section 
of the Christian Socialist party) in 1894. The Labour movement led 
to the development of the Arbeiterzeitung^ from a weekly, when it 
succeeded the Gleichheit in 1889, to a daily in 1895. It was therefore 
the first Social Democratic daily of Austria. In 1893 the Neues 
Wiener Journal was founded as a political neutral, and the old, 
Presse disappeared in 1894, its place being filled by the weekly 
Reichswehr (military), established in 1888. The French daily paper, 
Le Petit Journal de Vienne, was founded in JMay 1899. In 1902 
nineteen political dailies were published in Vienna. 

In 1883 the Hungarian journals numbered 170; in 1899 they were 
returned as 764. Budapest, which in 1890 had 14 dailies and 10 
weeklies, in 1900 had 21 and 3 respectively. The leading papers are 
the Budapest Kogtong, the Pester Lloyd and the Budapeste^ Hirlap. 
Of the German provincial press the most highly developed is in the 
German towns of Bohemia and in Prague, and the foundation of the 
Deutsche Volkszeitung at Reichenberg in 1885 marks the date of 
separation of the DeutsckfortschritUiche and Deutschvolkliche parties, 
while the Radical party, which greatly increased in Bohemia, was 
first represented by the weekly Deutscher Volksbote at Prague, and 
also in 1897 by the Unverfdlschie deulsche Worte, edited by Iro at 
Eger. A peculiar feature in Austrian journalism is the existence of 
German organs of the Czech national movement, of which the repre- 
sentative is the Prague daily Politik, founded in 1862. In Silesia the 
anti-Semitic Freie Scklesische Presse was founded in 1881 at Troppau, 
and when it changed sides in 1889 it was speedily replaced, 1891, by 
the Deutsche Went. In Moravia the representative papers of the 
Czech Conservatives and Radicals were the Mir and the Pozar 
respectively. The newspapers in Galicia, which increased steadily 
after 1870, are both numerous and important. The leading ones are 
the Slovo Polskie in Lemberg and the Glos Naroda in Cracow. In 
1900 there were 161 newspapers in Polish, as against 10 in 1848 and 
50 in 1873. Of the lesser Slavic nations, the Slovenians advanced the 
most, the Slovenski List having started at the end of 1896. In 
Illyrian journalism the chief newspapers founded after 1880 were the 
Crvena Hrvatska (1891), and the Hrvatska Kruna (1893). An attempt 
at unity amongst the Ruthcnian factions in 1885 to i887produced the 
Mir, while the Ruslan, a daily founded at Lemberg in 1896, advo- 
cated joint action by Poles and Ruthenians. The Bukowyna, 
established in 1885, developed into the organ of " Young Ruthenia," 
and the Bukowinska Widomosty, established in 1895, represented the 
Old Ruthenians. 

The Italian press in Austria was represented in 1900 chiefly by the 
very popular daily Piccolo, published at Trieste; it had a formidable 
rival in the Mattino, from 1885 to 1898. The Fede e Lavoro, published 
at Roveredo, was the organ of the Catholic Labour party, and 
VAwenire del Lavoro, at Bozcn, that of the Socialists. In Dalmatia 
the Corriere Nazionale, founded in 1896 at Zara and afterwards 
published at Trieste, was the organ of the autonomist Italians, while 
// Dalmata continued to represent the National Liberals. 

Belgium. — The Nieuwe Tijdinghen of Antwerp, published by 
Abraham Verhoeven, has been said to date virtually from 1605, in 
which year a " licence for the exclusive retailing of news " was ac- 
corded to him by the archduke Albert and the archduchess Isabella. 
But the claim is conjectural. No copy of any number anterior to 1616 
is now known to exist. It seems probable that the Gazette Extra- 
ordinaris Postlijdinghen, published by Wilhelm Verdussen between 
1637 and 1644, is a continuation of Verhoeven's paper. But, be this as 
it may, that of Verdussen was certainly the foundation of the well- 
known Gazette van Antwerpen, which continued to appear until 1827. 

Bruges had its Nieuwe Tijdinghen uyt versckeyden Quartieren, 
published (in black letter) by Nicholaes Breyghel. When this paper 
was commenced is uncertain, but various numbers of it exist with 
dates between 1637 and 1645. In one of these (26th July 1644) 
a Brusselsche Gazette of the 24th of that month is quoted, apart from 
which citation no Brussels paper is known of earlier date than 16^9. 
When* the first number of Le Courier veritable des Pays-Bas made its 
appearance, the publisher (Jean Mommaert) prefaced the first 
number by an address to the reader, in which he says: " I have 
long endeavoured to meet with somebody who would give employ- 
ment to my presses in defending truth against the falsehoods which 
malignity and ignorance send daily abroad. I have at length found 
what I sought, and shall now be able to tell you, weekly, the most 
important things that are going on in the world." This paper 
became afterwards the Gazette de Bruxelles, then Gazette des Pays- 
Bas; and, under the last-named title, it continued to appear until 
1 79 1. The Annates Politiques of Linguet was one of the most re- 
markable of the political journals of Brussels in the 18th century. 
For a time the editor won the favour of the emperor Joseph II. by 
praising his reforms, and the Government subscribed for 1200 copies 
of his paper at two louis d'ors each a year; but here, as in almost 
every other place of residence during his chequered career, Linguet 
at length incurred fine and imprisonment. His journal was re- 
peatedly suppressed, and as often resumed under many modifications 
of title. It was continued in France, in Switzerland (at Lausanne), 
and in England. At one time it was so popular that a printer in 
Brussels _ regularly and rapidly published a pirated edition of it. 
For a brief period the publication was resumed at Brussels. Mallet 
DuPan was, for a time, a collaborator in the editorship. Linguet 
died by the guillotine in 1794. Le National was a famous paper for 
a^ short period prior to the revolution of 1830. Soon after its cessa- 
tion — its cresses were destroyed by the populace on the 26th August 
— *he official journal, Le Moniteur Beige, was established, — " the 
ministry deeming it indispensable to the success of its great political 
enterprise that a journal should be created which might expound its 
views, and act daily upon public opinion " ; and, on decree of the 
regency, it was published accordingly. 

The first newspaper published at Ghent, Gazette van Gent, appeared 
in 1667. Den'Vaderlavder, begun in October 1829, was, for a long 
period, one of the most widely circulated of the Flemish journals. 

In 1890 Brussels published 34 papers of various periodicity, among 
which the Moniteur Beige held the lead with a circulation of 90,000, 
while Le National (revived in 1885) and VEtoile (1869) circulated 
21,000 and 5000 respectively. In 1900 there were 18 dailies and 14 
weeklies, &c. Antwerp had 7 dailies in 1 890 and IQOO; Ghent 7 
dailies in 1890 and 6 in 1900; Liege 6 in 1890 and 5 in 1900. The 
halfpenny paper is well established. 

Holland. — The kingdom of the Netherlands has always been rich in 
newspapers, but they have usually had more weight commercially 
than politically. Amsterdam in 1890 had 10 dailies, and in 1900 had 
12 dailies (Algemeen Handelsblad, Nieuws van den Dag, &c). In 
1900 the Hague had 6 dailies (Daeblad, Vaderland, &c.) ; and Rotter- 
dam had 5 dailies (Nieuwe Rotterdammer Courant, &c). The oldest 
Dutch paper, the Haarlemsche Courant, founded in 1656, is still one 
of the leading journals. 

Italy. — The Diario d% Roma, although dating only from 1716, may 
claim to have been the patriarch of the Italian press. It lasted for 
nearly a century and a half. During its later years it was a daily 
paper, with a weekly supplement having the somewhat whimsical 
title Notizie del Giorno. Next to this came the Gazzetta Uffiziale di 
Napoli. ^ These and their congeners were published under a rigid 
censorship until far into the 19th century, and exercised little influ- 
ence of any kind. The first tentative movement towards a free press 
may, perhaps, be dated from the effort to establish at Milan, in 1818, 
under the editorship of Silvio PelHco, the Conciliatore, in which 
Simonde de Sismondi, Gonfalonieri and Romagnosi were fellow- 
writers. But the new journal was suppressed in 1820. The first 
really effectual effort had to wait for the lapse of nearly thirty years. 
VOpinione was first published in Turin (26th December 1847) after- 
wards in Rome. It had, amongst its many editors, Giacomo Durando 
(a soldier of mark, and twice minister of foreign affairs), Montezenolo, 
Giovini Bianchi and Giacomo Dina. The Florence Diritto, originally 
founded at Turin, in 185 1, by Lorenzo Valerio, was edited successively 
by Macchi, Bargini and Civinini, and as a radical organ attained 
great influence. Counting journals of all kinds, there were published 
in Italy in 1836 185 newspapers; in 1845, 200; in 1856, 311; in 
1864, 450; in 1875, 479. In 1882 the "periodicals" of all kinds 
numbered 1454, and total number of political dailies was 149. In 
1890 Rome published 13 dailies, and in 1900, 10 dailies. The leading 
Roman papers were the Fanfulla, representing the court and govern- 
ment; the Tribuna (5 centimes), a Liberal paper founded in 1883; 
the organ of the Vatican, UOsservatore Romano; and the popular 
Messaggiero. II Secolo (1866) and the Corriere delta Sera (1876) are 
issued from Milan. 

Russia, Poland and Finland. — The earliest gazette of Moscow 
(Moskovskya Viedomosti) was issued by order of Peter the Great on 
the 16th December 1702, but no copy is known now to exist of earlier 
date than the 2nd January following. The whole gazette of the year 
1703 was reproduced in facsimile by order of Baron de Korff (the 
imperial librarian at St Petersburg) in 1855, on occasion of the 
festival for the 3rd century of Moscow university. The existing 
Viedomosti dates only from 1766. That of St Petersburg dates from 
1718. The historian Karamzin established a short-lived Moscow 
journal (Moskovski Listok), and afterwards at St Petersburg the once 
widely-known Russian Courrier de V Europe (1802). The profits of 
the successful Invalide Russe (Russki Invalid), established in 1815 by 
Persorovius, were devoted to the sufferers by the war with France. 
Adding to the distinctively political journals those of miscellaneous 
character, the whole number of newspapers published within the 
Russian states — Poland and Finland excepted — in the year 1835 
was 136; in 1858 that number had grown to 179, of which 82 were 
published in St Petersburg and 15 in Moscow; 132 were printed in 
Russian, 3 in Russian and in German, 1 in Russian and in Polish, 28 
in German, 8 in French, 3 in English, I in Polish, 1 in Lithuanian, 1 in 
Italian. In 1879, under the more liberal rule of Alexander II., the 
number of political and miscellaneous journals had grown to 293, 
and of these 105 were under the direct influence of the Government. 
But, in truth, the period of relaxation of censorship, if strictly ex- 
amined, will be found to have lasted only from 1855 to 1864, when 
repressive measures were again and frequently resorted to. Poland in 
1830 had 49 newspapers. Fifty years later the number was still less 
than 70, of which 54 were in Polish, these numbers including journals 
of all kinds. Finland in i860 had 24 newspapers, half in Swedish, 
half in Finnish. In 1863 the number had increased to 32, in spite of 
the zealous opposition of Count de Berg, the governor-general, to all 
discussion of political events and " subjects which do not concern the 
people." He was very friendly to journals of gardening and cottage 
economy, and to magazines of light literature, and did not regard 
comic papers with anger provided they kept quite clear of politics. 
The paper which was long the chief Finnish organ, Suometar (founded 
at Helsingforsjn 1847), owec * mu ch of its popularity to the pains its 
editors took with their correspondence.* The Otdun Wukko-Samomat 
(" Uleaborg Daily News ") was for a considerable period the most 
northerly newspaper of the world, with the one exception of the 
little journal published at Tromso, in Norway. 

In 1880 the whole number of newspapers printed within the 
government of Finland was 46, while the total number of news- 
papers and journals of all kinds published within the whole Russian 
empire during the same year was 608. Of these, 417 were printed 
in the Russian language, 155 of them being official or administrative 
organs; 54 were printed in Polish, 40 in German, 11 in Lettish, 
10 in French, 7 in Esthoman, 3 in Lithuanian. 

In 1800 St Petersburg had 6 dailies; and in 1900 there were 16 
dailies (the St Peter shir gskya Viedomosti, the Novoya Vremja, the 
Journal de St PHersboure, Sec). Moscow increased from 5 to 8 
dailies (the Moskovskya Viedomosti, 8cc). The rest of Russia proper 
produced about 100 newspapers, of which one-third were dailies. 
In Russian Poland about 11 papers, one-half being dailies, were 
published at Warsaw in 1900 (Kurier Warsawski, Gazeta Polska, &c). 

Spain and Portugal. — In Spain no newspaper of any kind existed 
earlier than the 18th century, a Gaceta de Madrid starting about 
1726 (an alleged gaceta in 1626 is a myth). Even during the early 
years of the 19th century the capital contented itself with a 
single journal, the Diario de Madrid. The Peninsular War and 
the establishment of the Cortes ^ave the first impulse towards some- 
thing which might be called political journalism, but the change from 
total repression to absolute freedom was too sudden not to be grossly 
abused. The Diario de las Cortes, the Semanario Patriotico (published 
at Cadiz from 1808 to 181 1,) and the Aurora Mallorquina (published 
at Palma in 1812-1813) were the first of the new papers that attained 
importance. In 1814 the circulation or receipt in Spain of English 
newspapers was prohibited under penalty of ten years' imprison- 
ment. Most of the native journals fell with the Cortes in 1823. In 
the following year Ferdinand decreed the suppression of all the 
journals except the then Diario and Gaceta of Madrid, the Gaceta de 
Bayona, and certain provincial papers which dealt exclusively with 
commercial or scientific subjects. At the close of his reign only three 
or four papers were published in Madrid. Ten years afterwards 
there were 40; but the number was far more noticeable than the 
value. Spanish newspapers have been too often the mere stepping- 
stones of political adventurers, and not unfrequently the worst of 
them appear to have served the turn more completely than the best. 
Gonzales Bravo attained office mainly by the help of a paper of 
notorious scurrility, — El Guirigay. His press-law of 1867 introduced 
a sort of indirect censorship, and a system of " warnings," rather 
clandestine than avowed; and his former rivals met craft with 
craft. The Universal and the Correo were successively the organs of 
Jos6 Salamanca. At the end of 1854 the political journals published 
in Madrid numbered about 40, the most conspicuous being the now 
defunct Espafia and El Clamor Publico. In 1890 Madrid published 
38 papers, of which 15 were dailies; but by 1900 they declined to 28, 
of which 19 were dailies. The leading Spanish papers in 1900 were — 
El Correo (1879), Monarchico- Liberal; La Epoca, Conservative; 
El Impartial, Independent Liberal; La Justicia, an evening Re- 
publican paper; El Liberal, numbering among its contributors the 
best writers without distinction of party; and El Pais, the organ of 
the Progressives. 

Portugal in 1882 was credited with 179 journals of all kinds and 
of various periodicity. Of this number 68 appeared in Lisbon. The 
strictly political daily papers of Lisbon were 6 in number; those of 
Oporto 3. In 1890 Lisbon published 11 dailies; and in 1900, 19 
dailies. 

Sweden. — In Sweden the earliest regular newspaper appears to 
have been the Ordinarie Post-Tidende of Stockholm, first published 
in 1645, and continued until. 1680, then, after long suspension, re- 
vived under the title Post- ock Inrikes-Tidning. Stockholm has also 
its Aftonbladet. The Post-Tidende was followed by the Svensk 
Mercurius (1 675-1 683) and the Latin Relationes Curiosae (1682- 
1701). In 1742 a Swedish newspaper in French {Gazette Francaise de 
Stockholm) was commenced, and was followed in 1 772 by the Mercure 
de Suede. But the press in Sweden had small political influence until 
1820, when the Argus was established by Johannsen. The strife 
between " classicists " and " romanticists " spread itself in Sweden, 
as in France, from the field of literature into that of politics. Crusen- 
stolpe's Faderneslandbladet and Hjerta's Aftonbladet, founded in 
1830, were long the most conspicuous of the Swedish journals, — the 
former on the side of the royalists, the latter on that of the reformers. 
Hjerta's paper, in its best days, could boast of a circulation of 5000 
copies ; but on the accession of King Oscar it ceased to appear as an 
opposition organ. Almost every town in the provinces now has its 
paper. In 1890 Stockholm had 5 dailies and 12 weeklies, &c; in 
1900 it had 11 dailies and 4 weeklies, &c, while 93 provincial towns 
published 197 papers, mostly weeklies, &c. In the period 1890-1894 
a large number of newspapers appeared at Stockholm, but their 
duration was in general very snort, often only a few months 
(Lundstadt, Sveriges Periodiska Literatur, ii. 1896). A newspaper in 
Finnish is published at Haparanda. 

Denmark. — While Denmark published an Europaische Zeitung as 
early as 1663 and the Danske Mercurius in 1666, the political influ- 
ence of the press is a newer thing in that country than even in 
Sweden. Until 1830 Copenhagen had but two papers, and they filled 
their columns with mild extracts from foreign journals. Real 
activity in this direction dates from the establishment of the pro- 
vincial states in 1834. The Berlingske Tidende dates from 1749, and 
was at first published in German. The Fadrelandet in 1 848-1 840. was 
in a glow of zeal for Scandinavianism and " Young Denmark. * In 
1890 Copenhagen produced 8 dailies and 6 weeklies, &c. In 1900 it 
had 12 dailies and 2 weeklies, while 121 papers appeared in sixty- 
eight provincial towns. 

Reykjavik (Iceland) published two weekly papers in 1890, and the 
same number in 1900 (Thiodolfr and Isafola). 

Norway. — The earliest Norwegian paper was the Christiania 
Intelligentssedler, founded in 1763. Next to this came the Adresse- 
contors Efterretninger (1765), published at Bergen. Den Constitu- 
tionelle absorbed an older paper, called Norske Ri%stidende. The 
Morgenblad was founded in 1819. In 1890 Christiania published 12 
papers, of which only three appeared daily; in 1900 only 10 papers 
were produced, but 8 of them were dailies. The Morgenbladet still 
held its rank, and the Aftenposten had a large circulation. 

Switzerland. — In 1873 the total number of political and general 
newspapers in Switzerland was 230. In 1881 they numbered 342; 
53 were of daily issue, 166 appeared twice or thrice a week, and 7 
only were of weekly issue. A monthly compendium of the news of 
the day appeared at Rorschach, in the canton of St Gall, as early as 
January 1597. The editor was a German, one Samuel Dilbaum, of 
Augsburg. He varied his titles, so that his monthly newsbooks, 
although really consecutive, do not wear the appearance of serial 
publications. Sometimes he called his issue Historische Relatio, 
sometimes Beschreibung, sometimes Historische Erzahlung. Switzer- 
land has since become remarkable for the number of its newspapers 
in proportion to its size. Among the more important may be 
mentioned the Journal de Geneve and the Gazette de Lausanne, both 
Moderate Liberal, and the Catholic Courrier de Geneve. La Tribune 
de Geneve (1878) is a leading five-centime paper. 

Greece. — The few newspapers that made their sudden appearance 
in Greece during the war of liberation departed as hastily when King 
Otho brought with him a press-law, one of the provisos of which 
demanded caution-money by actual deposit. The journal Saviour 
was established, in 1834, as a Government organ, and was soon 
followed by Athena as the journal of the opposition. Ten years later 
7 distinctively political papers had been established, along with 13 
journals of miscellaneous nature. In 1877 there were, of all sorts, 
81 journals, of which 77 appeared in Greek, 2 in Greek and French, 
2 in French only ; 37 of these were printed in Athens, 17 in the Ionian 
Islands. In 1890 Athens published*) dailies and 4 weeklies, &c, and 
in 1900, 10 dailies and 2 weeklies. The chief papers, the Asty and the 
Acropolis, were mainly political and on the Liberal side, as indeed 
were nearly all the Athenian papers. 

Turkey. — During the embassy (i795) of Verninac Saint-Maur, 
envoy of the French republic, a French journal was established at, 
Pera. This, possibly, is the pioneer of all Turkish newspapers. 
Thirty years later (1825) the Spectateur de VOrient was founded at 
Smyrna, also by a Frenchman (Alexander Blacquet?). It was after- 
wards published under the titles Courrier and Journal de Smyrne. 
In like manner, the Moniteur Ottoman, first of strictly Constantino- 
politan journals, was founded by the above-named Blacquet in 
1 83 1. It soon changed its language to Turkish, and was edited by 
Franceschi. The second Smyrna newspaper, Echo de VOrient, 
established in 1838, was transferred to Constantinople in 1846. But 
not one of these papers has survived. In 1876 the total number of 
journals of all kinds published in the capital was 72 (namely, 20 in 
French, 16 in Turkish, 13 in Armenian, 12 in Greek, 11 in as many 
other tongues). In 1890 there were 19 papers, in various languages, 
published at Constantinople, most of them dailies; and in 1000 the 
number of papers decreased to 18. They appeared in the following 
languages: the Stamboul and 4 others in French, 3 in Turkish, 1 in 
Turkish and Greek, 3 in Greek, 2 in Armenian, 1 in^ English and 
French, and I each in Arabic, English, Italian and Persian. Smyrna 
published 8 papers, mostly weeklies, in 1890, and the same number 
in 1900. Owing to the number of Mahompedan fasts and feasts 
Turkish newspapers are somewhat irregular in their appearance.

towns, see under the separate topographical headings. (H. Cn.) 


NEWT (a corrupted form from " an evet " or " an effet," a 
term of Anglo-Saxon origin, still used in many parts of England), 
the name usually applied to the aquatic members of the family 
Salamandridae which constitute the genus Molge, formerly 
known as Triton. But the name Triton, applied to these 
Batrachians by N. Laurenti (1768), has already been used by 
Linnaeus (Systema Naturae) for parts of the barnacle (Lcpas 
anatifera). B. Merem (1820) proposed to substitute for it the 
name Molge, said to be derived from the Gr. M6X717S or M6X70S, 
" slow," in allusion to the movements of these animals on 
land. The similar name Molch designates these Batrachians in 
German. 

The newts are very closely related to the true Salamanders, 
Salamandra, from which they differ principally in the shape of 
the tail, which is compressed, in relation to their aquatic habits 
during a considerable part of the active period. Their aquatic 
progression is effected principally by means of the tail, and during 
the act of swimming the legs are turned backwards and folded 
against the body and tail, so as to admit of the smallest possible 
degree of resistance. 

A very marked sexual dimorphism prevails in most species 
of this genus, the males being more brilliantly coloured than the 
females and provided with a dorsal crest which attains its greatest 
development during the breeding season, lasting through the 
spring and the early summer. Later in the season the males 
more or less completely lose their crests and other nuptial orna- 
ments, and the two sexes are more alike; they then retire on 
land, concealing themselves under stones, logs of wood, or in 
holes in damp earth, but leaving their retreat at night or in wet 
weather, to search for earth-worms and slugs which constitute 
their principal food. In the water they are very destructive of 
tadpoles, insect larvae and crustaceans. 

A remarkable feature of the newts, which they share with the 
other tailed Batrachians and the larvae of the frogs and toads, 
is the great facility with which they regenerate lost parts, such 
as the tail, limbs, and even the eye, a faculty which has 
given rise to a great variety of experiments, from the days of 
Charles Bonnet and Spallanzani to those of the present school 
of Entwickelungsmechanik. 

Extraordinary as it may appear, considering the abundance of 
these creatures and the attention they have received from naturalists, 
it was only in 1880 that their mode of fecundation was correctly 
ascertained, from observation of the common newt by the Italian 
zoologist F. Gasco. The amorous games of the newts, so graphically 
represented by M. Rusconi, had been repeatedly described, and Abb6 
Spallanzani, as early as 1766, had ascertained the impregnation to be 
internal. The then current belief that the water served as a vehicle 
to convey the spermatozoa to the female organs had received a blow 
on Karl Theodor von Siebold's discovery of a receptaculum seminis in 
the female, but no satisfactory explanation had been given of the 
manner in which the spermatozoa reach ^ these pouches. This 
mystery Gasco succeeded in elucidating in his masterly ^ paper 
published in 1880, which has since been supplemented by his own 
investigations on the axolotl, and those of E. Zeller, E. O. Jordan and 
others on the European and American newts. 

All who have kept newts in an aquarium have witnessed the curious 
antics of the male placing himself before the female and rapidly 
vibrating his folded tail, or bending his body in a semicircle, as if to 
prevent her from passing ahead of him. The male then emits, at 
short intervals, in front of the female, several conical or bell-shaped 
spermatophores (a gelatinous secretion from the cloaca), adhering 
to the ground and crowned by a spherical mass of spermatozoa, 
which the female afterwards gathers in the lips of her cloaca either 
by mere applicationor by holding the spermatophore between her 
hind legs and pressing the mass of spermatozoa into the cloaca, 
whence they ultimately find their way into the lower part of the 
oviducts, where the eggs are fecundated as they descend. 

The larvae are provided with three pairs of long, fringed, plume- 
like external gills, which are not lost until the very last stages of the 
metamorphosis, and, in exceptional cases are even retained through- 
out life, the newt breeding in the branchiate condition, as often 
happens in the axolotl. The fore limbs are developed before the 
hind limbs. 

The genus Molge has a wide distribution, extending over Europe, 
north-west Africa, south-western Asia, eastern temperate Asia 
(China and Japan) and North America as far south as southern 
California and the Rio Grande del Norte. Twenty species are dis- 
tinguished. The British species are the crested newt (M. cristata), 
the common newt (M. vulgaris) and the palmated newt (M. palmata). 
The first is the largest, and measures 4 to 6 in. The skin is more or 
less rugose, with granular warts, a strong fold extends across the 
throat, and the male is provided with a very high dentate dorsal 
crest which is interrupted over the sacral region; the upper parts are 
dark, with more or less xlistinct black spots; the sides are speckled 
with white, and the lower parts are yellow or orange, spotted or 
marbled with black; a silvery stripe adorns the side ofthe tail in the 
male. The common and the palmated newts are smaller, 2§ to 4 in. 
in length, and have a smooth skin. The dorsal crest of the male is 
high and festooned in the former, low and straight-edged in the 
latter; during the breeding season the feet of the common newt are 
lobate like a grebe's, whilst they are webbed like a duck's in the 
palmated newt, which is further distinguished in having the tail 
truncate and terminating in a filament. 

It is a remarkable fact that, although related so closely and occur- 
ring so frequently together in pools of small extent, the common and 
palmated newts are not known ever to produce hybrids, whilst the 
crested newt, when coexisting (in some parts of France) with a 
south-western ally, the beautiful Molge marmorata, to which it is by 
no means more nearly akin than are the two above-named species 
to each other, regularly gives rise to the form known as M. btasii, 
which has been proved to be a cross between M. cristata and M. 
marmorata.

NEWTON, ALFRED (1820-1907), English zoologist, was born 
at Geneva on the nth of June 1829. In 1854 he was elected 
travelling fellow of Magdalene College, Cambridge, of which he 
had been an undergraduate, and subsequently visited many parts 
of the world, including Lapland, Iceland, Spitsbergen, the West 
Indies and North America. In 1866 he became the first professor 
of zoology and comparative anatomy at Cambridge, a position 
which he retained till his death. His services to ornithology and 
zoogeography were recognized by the Royal Society in 1900, 
when it awarded him a Royal medal. He wrote many books, 
including Zoology of Ancient Europe (1862), Ootheca Wolleyana 
(begun in 1864), Zoology (1872), and a Dictionary of Birds (1893- 
1896). The last, still a standard work, was an amplification of 
the numerous articles on birds which he contributed to the 9th 
edition of the Encyclopaedia Brilatinica, and which with com- 
paratively slight revision are retained in the present edition. He 
contributed many memoirs to scientific societies, and edited The 
Ibis (1865-1870), the Zoological Record (iSyo-iSj 2), and YarreWs 
British Birds (1871-1882). He died at Cambridge on the 7th of 
June 1907. 


NEWTON, SIR CHARLES THOMAS (1816-1894), British 
archaeologist, was born on the 16th of September 1816, at 
Bredwardine in Herefordshire, and educated at Shrewsbury 
School and Christ Church, Oxford. He entered the British 
Museum in 1840 as an assistant in the Antiquities Department. 
Antiquities, classical, Oriental and medieval, as well as ethno- 
graphical objects, were at the time included in one department, 
which had no classical archaeologist among its officers. In 
1852 Newton quitted the Museum to become vice-consul at 
Mitylene, with the object of exploring the coasts and islands 
of Asia Minor. Aided by funds supplied by Lord Stratford de 
Rcdcliffe, then British ambassador at Constantinople, he made 
in 1852 and 1855 important discoveries of inscriptions at the 
island of Calymnos, off the coast of Caria; and in 1 856-1 857 
achieved the great archaeological exploit of his fife by the 
discovery of the remains of the mausoleum of Halicarnassus, 
one of the " seven wonders " of the ancient world. He was 
greatly assisted by Murdoch Smith, afterwards celebrated in 
connexion with Persian telegraphs. The results were described 
by Newton in his History of Discoveries at Halicarnassus (1862- 
1863), written in conjunction with R. P. Pullan, and in his 
Travels and Discoveries in the Levant (1865). These works 
included particulars of other important discoveries, especially 
at Branchidae, where he disinterred the statues which had 
anciently lined the Sacred Way, and at Cnidos, where R. P. 
Pullan, acting under his direction, found the colossal lion now 
in the British Museum. 

In 1855 Newton declined the regius professorship of Greek at 
Oxford. In i860 he was made British consul at Rome, but had 
scarcely entered upon the post when an opportunity presented 
itself of reorganizing the amorphous department of antiquities 
at the British Museum, which was divided into three and ulti- 
mately four branches. The Greek and Roman section naturally 
fell to Newton, who returned as Keeper, and held the office until 
1885, declining the offer of the principal librarianship made to 
him in 1878. The Mausoleum Room, to accommodate the 
treasures he had found in Asia Minor, was built under his super- 
vision, but the most brilliant episode of his administration was 
the acquisition of the Blacas and Castellani gems and sculptures. 
The Farnese and Pourtales collections were also acquired by him. 
He took a leading part in the foundation of the Society for the 
Promotion of Hellenic Studies, the British School at Athens, 
and the Egypt Exploration Fund. He was Yates professor of 
classical archaeology at University College, London, from 1880 
to 1888. His collected Essays on Art and Archaeology were 
published in 1886. When, on his retirement from the Museum, 
his bust by Boehm, now placed in one of the sculpture galleries, 
was presented to him as a testimonial, he desired the unexpended 
balance to be given to the school at Athens. After his retirement 
he was much occupied with the publication of the Greek inscrip- 
tions in the British Museum, but his health failed greatly in the 
latter years of his life. He died at Margate on the 28th of 
November 1894. He married in 1861 the daughter of his 
successor in the consulate at Rome, the painter Severn, herself 
a distinguished artist. She died in 1866. (R. G.) 


NEWTON, SIR ISAAC (1642-1727), English natural philo- 
sopher, was born on the 25th of December 1642 (o.s.), at Wools- 
thorpe, a hamlet in the parish of Colsterworth, Lincolnshire, 
about 6 m. from Grantham. His father (also Isaac Newton) 
who farmed a small freehold property of his own, died before his 
son's birth, a few months after his marriage to Hannah Ayscough, 
a daughter of James Ayscough of Market-Overton. When 
Newton was little more than two years old his mother married 
Barnabas Smith, rector of North Witham. Of this marriage 
there was issue, Benjamin, Mary and Hannah Smith, and to their 
children Sir Isaac Newton subsequently left the greater part 
of his property. After having acquired the rudiments of educa- 
tion at two small schools in hamlets close to Woolsthorpe, 
Newton was sent at the age of twelve to the grammar school of 
Grantham. While attending Grantham school Newton lived 
in the house of Mr Clark, an apothecary of that town. According 
to his own confession he was far from industrious, and stood 
very low in his class. An unprovoked attack from the boy next 
above him led to a fight, in which Newton's pluck gave him the 
victory. This success seems to have led him to greater exertions, 
and he rose to be the head boy of the school. He displayed 
very early a taste and an aptitude for mechanical contrivances. 
He made windmills, water-clceks, kites and dials, and he is said 
to have invented a four-wheeled carriage which was to be moved 
by the rider. In 1656 Mr Smith died, and Newton's mother 
came back with her three children to Woolsthorpe. Newton 
was then in his fifteenth year, and, as his mother in all probability 
intended him to be a farmer, he was taken away from school. He 
was frequently sent on market days to Grantham with an old 
and trusty servant, who made all the purchases, while Newton 
spent his time among the books in Mr Clark's house. It soon 
became apparent to Newton's relatives that they were making 
a great mistake in attempting to turn him into a farmer^ 
and he was therefore sent back again to school at Grantham. 
His mother's brother, William Ayscough, the rector of Burton 
Coggles, the next parish, was a graduate of Trinity College, 
Cambridge, and when he found that Newton's mind was wholly 
devoted to mechanical and mathematical problems, he urged 
upon Mrs Smith the desirability of sending her son to his own 
college. He was accordingly admitted a member of Trinity 
College on the 5th of June 1 661, as a subsizar, and was matricu- 
lated on the 8th of July. 'We have scarcely any information 
as to his attainments when he commenced residence, and very 
little as to his studies as an undergraduate. It is known that 
while still at Woolsthorpe Sanderson's Logic had been read by 
him to such purpose that his tutor at Trinity College excused 
his attendance at a course of lectures on that subject. Newton 
tells us himself that, when he had purchased a book on astrology 
at Stourbridge fair, a fair held close to Cambridge, he was unable, 
on account of his ignorance of trigonometry, to understand a 
figure of the heavens which was drawn in this book. He therefore 
bought an English edition of Euclid with an index of propositions 
at the end of it, and, having turned to two or three which he 
thought likely to remove his difficulties, he found them so self- 
evident that he put aside Euclid " as a trifling book," and 
applied himself to the study of Descartes's Geometry. It is 
reported that in his examination for a scholarship at Trinity, 
to which he was elected on the 28th of April 1664, he was 
examined in Euclid by Dr Isaac Barrow, who formed a poor 
opinion of his knowledge, and that in consequence Newton 
was led to read the Elements again with care, and thereby to 
form a more favourable estimate of Euclid's merits. 

The study of Descartes's Geometry seems to have inspired 
Newton with a love of the subject, and to have introduced him 
to the higher mathematics. In a small commonplace book, 
bearing on the seventh page the date of January 1663/1664, 
there are several articles on angular sections, and the squaring 
of curves and " crooked lines that may be squared," several 
calculations about musical notes, geometrical propositions from 
Francis Vieta and Frans van Schooten, annotations out of WalhVs 
Arithmetic of Infinities ', together with observations on refraction, 
on the grinding of " spherical optic glasses," on the errors of lenses 
and the method of rectifying them, and on the extraction of 
all kinds of roots, particularly those " in affected powers." 
And in this same commonplace book the following entry made by 
Newton himself, many years afterwards, gives a further account 
of the nature of his work during the period when he was an 
undergraduate: — 

11 July 4, 1699. — By consulting an account of my expenses at 
Cambridge, in the years 1663 and 1664, I find that in the year 1664 
a little before Christmas, I, being then Senior Sophister, bought 
Schooten *s Miscellanies and Cartes' Geometry (having read this 
Geometry and Ought red's Clavis clean over half a year before), and 
borrowed Wallis's works, and by consequence made these annotations 
out of Schooten and Wallis, in winter between the years 1664 and 
1665. At such time I found the method of Infinite Series; and in 
summer 1665, being forced from Cambridge by the plague, I com- 
puted the area of the Hyperbola at Boothby, in Lincolnshire, to 
two and fifty figures by the same method." 

That Newton must have begun early to make careful observa- 
tions of natural phenomena is sufficiently testified by the follow- 
ing remarks about halos, which appear in his Optics y book ii. 
part iv. obs. 13: — 

11 The like Crowns appear sometimes about the moon; for in the 
beginning of the Year 1664, February 19th, at night, I saw two 
such Crowns about her. The Diameter of the first or innermost 
was about three Degrees, and that of the second about five Degrees 
and an half. Next about the moon was a Circle of white, and next 
about that the inner Crown, which was of a bluish green within 
next the white, and of a yellow and red without, and next about 
these Colours were blue and green on the inside of the Outward 
Crown, and red on the outside of it. At the same time there appear'd 
a Halo about 22 Degrees 35' distant from the center of the moon. 
It was elliptical, and its long Diameter was perpendicular to the 
Horizon, verging below farthest from the moon." 

In January 1665 Newton took the degree of B.A. The persons 
appointed (in conjunction with the proctors, John Slade of 
Catharine Hall, and Benjamin Pulleyn of Trinity College, 
Newton's tutor) to examine the questionists were John Eaehard 
of Catharine Hall and Thomas Gipps of Trinity College. It 
is a curious accident that we have no information about the 
respective merits of the candidates for a degree in this year, 
as the " ordo senioritatis " of the bachelors of arts for the year 
is omitted in the " Grace Book." 

It is supposed that it was in 1665 that the method of fluxions 
first occurred to Newton's mind. There are several papers 
still existing in Newton's handwriting bearing dates 1665 and 
1666 in which the method is described, in some of which dotted 
or dashed letters are used to represent fluxions, and in some of 
which the method is explained without the use of dotted letters. 

Both in 1665 and in 1666 Trinity College was dismissed on 
account of the plague. On each occasion it was agreed, as 
appears by entries in the " Conclusion Book " of the college, 
bearing dates August 7th, 1665, and June 22nd, 1666, and signed 
by the master of the college, Dr Pearson, that all fellows and 
scholars who were dismissed on account of the pestilence be allowed 
one month's commons. Newton must have left college before 
August 1665, as his name does not appear in the list of those 
who received extra commons on that occasion, and he tells us him- 
self in the extract from his commonplace book already quoted 
that he was " forced from Cambridge by the plague " in the 
summer of that year. He was elected a fellow of his college on 
the 1st of October 1667. There were nine vacancies, one of which 
was caused by the death of Abraham Cowley in the previous 
summer, and the nine successful candidates were all of the same 
academical standing. A few weeks after his election to a 
fellowship Newton went to Lincolnshire, and did not return to 
Cambridge till the February following, On the 16th of March 
1668 he took his degree of M.A. 

During the years 1666 to 1669 Newton's studies were of a 
very varied kind. It is known that he purchased prisms and 
lenses on two or three several occasions, and also chemicals 
and a furnace, apparently for chemical experiments; but he 
also employed part of his time on the theory of fluxions and other 
branches of pure mathematics. He wrote a paper Analysis 
per Equaliones N timer Terminorum Infinitas, which he put, pro- 
bably in June 1669, into the hands of Isaac Barrow (then 
Lucasian professor of mathematics), at the same time giving him 
permission to communicate the contents to their common friend 
John Collins (1624-1683), a mathematician of no mean order. 
Barrow did this on the 31st of July 1669, but kept the name of 
the author a secret, and merely told Collins that he was a friend 
staying at Cambridge, who had a powerful genius for such 
matters. In a subsequent letter on the 20th of August, Barrow 
expressed his pleasure at hearing the favourable opinion which 
Collins had formed of the paper, and added, " the name of the 
author is Newton, a fellow of our college, and a young man, 
who is only in his second year since he took the degree of master 
of arts, and who, with an unparalleled genius (eximio quo est 
acumine), has made very great progress in this branch of mathe- 
matics." Shortly afterwards Barrow resigned his chair, and was 
instrumental in securing Newton's election as his successor. 
Newton was elected Lucasian professor on the 29th of October 
1669. It was his duty as professor to lecture at least once a week 
in term time on some portion of geometry, arithmetic, astronomy, 
geography, optics, statics, or some other mathematical subject, 
and also for two hours in the week to allow an audience to any 
student who might come to consult with the professor on any 
difficulties he had met with. The subject which Newton chose 
for his lectures was optics. The success which attended his 
researches in optics must have been great, although the results 
were known only through his own oral lectures, until he presented 
an account of them to the Royal Society in the spring of 1672. 
On the 2 1 st of December 167 1 he was proposed as a candidate 
for admission into the Royal Society by Dr Seth Ward, bishop 
of Salisbury, and on the nth of January 1672 he was elected a 
fellow of the Society. At the meeting at which Newton was 
elected a description of a reflecting telescope which he had in- 
vented was read, and " it was ordered that a letter should be 
written by the secretary to Mr Newton to acquaint him of his 
election into the Society, and to thank him for the communication 
of his telescope, and to assure him that the Society would take 
care that all right should be done him with respect to this 
invention." 

In his reply to the secretary on the 18th of January 1672, 
Newton writes: — 

" I desire that in your next letter you would inform me for what 
time the society continue their weekly meetings; because, if they 
continue them for any time, 1 am purposing them to be considered 
of and examined an account of a philosophical discovery, which 
induced me to the making of the said telescope, and which 1 doubt 
not but will prove much more grateful than the communication of 
that < instrument being in my judgment the oddest if not the most 
considerable detection which hath hitherto been made into the 
operations of nature." 

The promise here made was fulfilled in a communication 
which Newton addressed to Henry Oldenburg, the secretary of 
the Royal Society, on the 6th of February 1672, and which was 
read before the society two days afterwards. The whole is 
printed in No ; 80 of the Philosophical Transactions. 

After explaining his discovery of the composition of white light, he 
proceeds: — 

" When I understood this, 1 left off my aforesaid Glass works; for 
1 saw, that the perfection of Telescopes was hitherto limited, not so 
much for want of glasses truly figured according to the prescriptions 
of Optick Authors (which all men have hitherto imagined), as 
because that Light itself is a Heterogeneous mixture of differently 
refrangible Rays. So that, were a glass so exactly figured as to 
collect any one sort of rays into one point, it could not collect those 
also into the same point, which having the same Incidence upon the 
same Medium are apt to suffer a different refraction. Nay, J 
wondered, that seeing the difference of refrangibility was so great, as 
1 found it, Telescopes should arrive to that perfection they are 
now at." 

He then points out why " the object-glass of any Telescope cannot 
collect all the rays which come from one point of an object, so as to 
make them convene at its focus in less room than in a circular space, 
whose diameter is the 50th part of the Diameter of its Aperture: 
which is an irregularity some hundreds of times greater, than a 
circularly figured Lens, of so small a section as the Object-glasses of 
long Telescopes are, would cause by the unfitness of its figure, were 
Light uniform." He adds: "This made me take reflections into 
consideration, and finding them regular, so that the Angle of Reflec- 
tion of all sorts of Rays was equal to their Angle of Incidence; 1 
understood, that by their mediation Optick instruments might be 
brought to any degree of perfection imaginable, provided a Re- 
flecting substance could be found, which would polish as finely as 
Glass, and reflect as much light, as glass transmits, and the art of 
communicating to it a Parabolick figure be also attained. But these 
seemed very great difficulties, and I have almost thought them 
insuperable, when I further considered, that every irregularity in a 
reflecting superficies makes the rays stray 5 or 6 times more out of 
their due course, than the like irregularities in a refracting one; so 
that a much greater curiosity would be here requisite, than in figuring 
glasses for Refraction. 

" Amidst these thoughts I was forced from Cambridge by the 
Intervening Plague, and it was more than two years before I pro- 
ceeded further. But then having thought on a tender way of polish- 
ing, proper for metal!, whereby, as 1 imagined, the figure also would 
be corrected to the last; I began to try, what might be effected in 
this kind, and by degrees so far perfected an Instrument (in the 
essential parts of it like that 1 sent to London), by which 1 could 
discern Jupiters 4 Concomitants, and shewed them divers times to 
two others of my acquaintance. I could also discern the Moon-like 
phase of Venus, but not very distinctly, nor without some niceness in 
disposing the Instrument. 

" From that time I was interrupted till this last Autumn, when I 
made the other. And as that was sensibly better than the first 
(especially for Day-Objects), so I doubt not, but they will be still 
brought to a much greater perfection by their endeavours, who, as 
you inform me, are taking care about it at London." 

After a remark that microscopes seem as capable of improvement 
as telescopes, he adds: " I shall now proceed to acquaint you with 
another more notable difformity in its Rays, wherein the Origin of 
Colour is unfolded: Concerning which I shall lay down the Doctrine 
first, and then, for its examination, give you an instance or two of the 
Experiments, as a specimen of the rest. The Doctrine you will find 
comprehended and illustrated in the following propositions: 

" r. As the Rays of light differ in degrees of Refrangibility, so 
they also differ in their disposition to exhibit this or that particular 
colour. Colours are not Qualifications of Light, derived from Refrac- 
tions, or Reflections of natural Bodies (as 'tis generally believed), 
but original and connate properties, which in divers Rays are divers. 
Some Rays are disposed to exhibit a red colour and no other; some a 
yellow and no other, some a green and no other, and so of the rest. 
Nor are there only Rays proper and particular to the more eminent 
colours, but even to all their intermediate gradations. 

" 2. To the same degree of Refrangibility ever belongs the same 
colour, and to the same colour ever belongs the same degree of 
Refrangibility. The least Refrangible Rays are all disposed to 
exhibit a Red colour, and contrarily those Rays, which are disposed 
to exhibit a Red colour, are all the least Refrangible: So the most 
refrangible Rays are all disposed to exhibit a deep Violet Colour, 
and contrarily those which are apt to exhibit such a violet colour 
are all the most Refrangible. 

" And so to all the intermediate colours in a continued series 
belong intermediate degrees of refrangibility. And this Analogy 
'twixt colours, and refrangibility is very precise and strict; the 
Rays always either exactly agreeing in both, or proportionally 
disagreeing in both. 

" 3. The species of colour, and degree of Refrangibility proper to 
any particular sort of Rays, is not mutable by Refraction, nor by 
Reflection from natural bodies, nor by any other cause, that I could 
yet observe. When any one sort of Rays hath been well parted 
from those of other kinds, it hath afterwards obstinately retained 
its colour, notwithstanding my utmost endeavours to change it. I 
have refracted it with Prismes, and reflected it with Bodies, which 
in Day-light were of other colours; I have intercepted it with the 
coloured film of Air interceding two^ compressed plates of glass, 
transmitted it through coloured Mediums, and through Mediums 
irradiated with other sorts of Rays, and diversly terminated it; and 
yet could never produce any new colour out of it. It would by 
contracting or dilating become more brisk, or faint, and by the loss 
of many Rays, in some cases very obscure and dark; but 1 could 
never see it changed in specie. 

" Yet seeming transmutations of Colours may be made, where 
there is any mixture of divers sorts of Rays. For in such mixtures, 
the component colours appear not, but, by their mutual allaying 
each other constitute a midling colour." 

Further on, after some remarks on the subject of compound colours, 
he says: " I might add more instances of this nature, but I shall 
conclude with this general one, that the Colours of all natural Bodies 
have no other origin than this, that they are variously qualified 
to reflect one sort of light in greater plenty then another. And this 
I have experimented in a dark Room by illuminating those bodies 
with uncompounded light of divers colours. For by that means any 
body may be made to appear of any colour. They have there no 
appropriate colour, but ever apoear of the colour of the light cast 
upon them, but yet with this difference, that they are most brisk 
and vivid in the light of their own day-light colour. Minium 
appeareth there of any colour indifferently, with which 'tis illustrated, 
but yet most luminous in red, and so Bise appeareth indifferently of 
any colour with which 'tis illustrated, but yet most luminous in 
blew. And therefore minium reflecteth Rays of any colour, but 
most copiously those indued with red; and consequently when 
illustrated with day-light, that is with all sorts of Rays promiscuously 
blended, those qualified with red shall abound most in the reflected 
light, and by their prevalence cause it to appear of that colour. 
And for the same reason Bise t reflecting blew most copiously, shall 
appear blew by the excess of those Rays in its reflected light; and 
the like of other bodies. And that this is the intire and adequate 
cause of their colours, is manifest, because they have no power to 
change or alter the colours of any sort of Rays incident apart, but 
put on all colours indifferently, with which they are inlightened. 

" Reviewing what I have written, I see the discourse it self will 
lead to divers Experiments sufficient for its examination: And 
therefore I shall not trouble you further, than to describe one of 
those, which I have already insinuated. 

" In a darkened Room make a hole in the shut of a window whose 
diameter may conveniently be about a third part of an inch, to 
admit a convenient quantity of the Suns light: And there place a 
clear and colourless Prisme, to refract the entring light towards the 
further part of the Room, which, as I said, will thereby be diffused 
into an oblong coloured Image. Then place a Lens of about three foot 
radius (suppose a broad Object-glass of a three foot Telescope), at 
the distance of about four or five foot from thence, through which all 
those colours may at once be transmitted, and made by its Refraction 
to convene at a further distance of about ten or twelve feet. If at 
that distance you intercept this light with a sheet of white paper, you 
will see the colours converted into whiteness again by being mingled. 

11 But it is requisite, that the Prisme and Lens be placed steady, 
and that the paper, on which the colours are cast be moved to and 
fro; for, by such motion, you will not only find, at what distance 
the whiteness is most perfect but also see, how the colours gradually 
convene, and vanish into whiteness, and afterwards having crossed 
one another in that place where they compound Whiteness, are again 
dissipated and severed, and in an inverted order retain the same 
colours, which they had before they entered the composition. You 
may also see, that, if any of the Colours at the Lens be intercepted, 
the Whiteness will be changed into the other colours. And therefore, 
that the composition of whiteness be perfect, care must be taken, 
that none of the colours fall besides the Lens." 

He concludes his communication with the^ words: "This, I 
conceive, is enough for an Introduction to Experiments of this kind: 
which if any of the R. Society shall be so curious as to prosecute, I 
should be very glad to be informed with what success: That, if any 
thing seem to be defective, or to thwart this relation, I may have an 
opportunity of giving further direction about it, or of acknowledging 
my errors, if I nave committed any." 

The publication of these discoveries led to a series of con- 
troversies which lasted for several years, in which Newton had 
to contend with the eminent English natural philosopher Robert 
Hooke ; Lucas, mathematical professor at Liege ; Linus, a physician 
in Liege, and many others. Some of his opponents denied the 
truth of his experiments, refusing to helieve in the existence of the 
spectrum. Others criticized the experiments, saying that the 
length of the spectrum was never more than three and a half 
times the breadth, whereas Newton found it to be five times 
the breadth. It appears that Newton made the" mistake of 
supposing that all prisms would give a spectrum of exactly the 
same length; the objections of his opponents led him to measure 
carefully the lengths of spectra formed by prisms of different 
angles and of different refractive indices; and it seems strange 
that he was not led thereby to the discovery of the different 
clispersive powers of different refractive substances. 

Newton carried on the discussion with the objectors with great 
courtesy and patience, but the amount of pain which these 
perpetual discussions gave to his sensitive mind may be estimated 
from the fact of his writing on the 18th of November 1676 to 
Oldenburg: — 

11 I promised to send you an answer to Mr Lucas this next Tuesday, 
but I find I shall scarce finish what I have designed, so as to get a 
copy taken of it by that time, and therefore I beg your patience a 
week longer. I see I have made myself a slave to philosophy, but if 
I get free of Mr Lucas's business, I will^ resolutely bid adieu to it 
eternally, excepting what I do for my private satisfaction, or leave 
to come out after me; for I see a man must either resolve to put out 
nothing new, or to become a slave to defend it." 

It was a fortunate circumstance that these disputes did not so 
thoroughly damp Newton's ardour as he at the time felt they 
would. He subsequently published many papers in the Philo- 
sophical Transactions on various parts of the science of optics, 
and, although some of his views have been found to be erroneous, 
and are now almost universally rejected, his investigations 
led to discoveries which are of permanent value. He succeeded in 
explaining the colour of thin and of thick plates, and the inflexion 
of light, and he wrote on double refraction, polarization and 
binocular vision. He also invented a reflecting sextant for 
observing the distance between the moon and the fixed stars, — 
the same in every essential as the instrument which is still in 
everyday use at sea under the name of Hadley's quadrant. 
This discovery was communicated by him to Edmund Halley 
in 1700, but was not published, or communicated to the Royal 
Society, till after Newton's death, when a description of it was 
found among his papers. 

In March 1673 Newton took a prominent part in a dispute in 
the university. The public oratorship fell vacant, and a contest 
arose between the heads of the colleges and the members of the 
senate as to the mode of electing to the office. The heads 
claimed the right of nominating two persons, one of whom was 
to be elected by the senate. The senate insisted that the proper 
mode was by an open election. The duke of Buckingham, who 
was the chancellor of the university, endeavoured to effect a 
compromise which, he says, " I hope may for the present satisfy 
both sides, I propose that the heads may for this time nominate 
and the body comply, yet interposing (if they think fit) a pro- 
testation concerning their plea that this election may not here- 
after pass for a decisive precedent in prejudice of their claim," 
and, " whereas I understand that the whole university has 
chiefly consideration for Dr Henry Paman of St John's and Mr 
Craven of Trinity College, I do recommend them both to he 
nominated." The heads, however, nominated Dr Paman and 
Ralph Sanderson of St John's, and the next day one hundred and 
twenty-one members of the senate recorded their votes for 
Craven and ninety-eight for Paman. On the morning of the 
election a protest in which Newton's name appeared was read, and 
entered in the Regent House. But the vice-chancellor admitted 
Paman the same morning, and so ended the first contest of a 
non-scientific character in which Newton took part. 

On the 8th of March 1673 Newton wrote to Oldenburg, the 
secretary of the Royal Society: 

" Sir, I desire that you will procure that I may be put out from 
being any longer Fellow of the Royal Society: for though I honour 
that body, yet since I see I shall neither profit them, nor (by reason 
of this distance) can partake of the advantage of their assemblies, I 
desire to withdraw." 

Oldenburg must have replied to this by an offer to apply to the 
Society to excuse Newton the weekly payments, as in a letter of 
Newton's to Oldenburg, dated the 23rd of June 1673, he says, 
" For your proffer about my quarterly payments, I thank you, 
but I would not have you trouble yourself to get them excused, 
if you have not done it already." Nothing further seems to have 
been done in the matter until the 28th of January 1675, when 
Oldenhurg informed " the Society that Mr Newton is now in such 
circumstances that he desires to be excused from the weekly 
payments."- Upon this " it was agreed to by the council that he 
be dispensed with, as several others are." On the 1 8th of February 

1675 Newton was formally admitted into the Society. The 
most probable explanation of the cause why Newton wished to be 
excused from these payments is to be found in the fact that, as 
he was not in holy orders, his fellowship at Trinity College would 
lapse in the autumn of 1675. It is true that the loss to his income 
which this would have caused was obviated by a patent from 
the crown in April 1675, allowing him as Lucasian professor 
to retain his fellowship without the obligation of taking holy 
orders. This must have relieved Newton's mind from a great deal 
of anxiety about pecuniary matters, as we find him in November 

1676 subscribing £40 towards the building of the new library of 
Trinity College. 

It is" supposed that it was at Woolsthorpe in the summer of 
1666 that Newton's thoughts were directed to the subject of 
gravity. Voltaire is the authority for the well-known anecdote 
about the apple. He had his information from Newton's 
favourite niece Catharine Barton, who married Conduitt, a 
fellow of the Royal Society, and one of Newton's intimate 
friends. How much truth there is in what is a plausible and a 
favourite story can never be known, but it is certain that tradition 
marked a tree as that from which the apple fell, till 1820, when, 
owing to decay, the tree was cut down and its wood carefully 
preserved.

Johann Kepler had proved by an elaborate series of measure- 
ments that each planet revolves in an elliptical orbit round the 
sun, whose centre occupies one of the foci of the orbit, that the 
radius vector of each planet drawn from the sun describes equal 
areas in equal times, and that the squares of the periodic times 
of the planets are in the same proportion as the cubes of their 
mean distances from the sun. The fact that heavy bodies have 
always a tendency to fall to the earth, no matter at what height 
they are placed above the earth's surface, seems to have led 
Newton to conjecture that it was possible that the same tendency 
to fall to the earth was the cause by which the moon was retained 
in its orbit round the earth. Newton, by calculating from 
Kepler's laws, and supposing the orbits of the planets to be 
circles round the sun in the centre, had already proved that the 
force of the sun acting upon the different planets must vary 
as the inverse square of the distances of the planets from the sun. 
He therefore was led to inquire whether, if the earth's attraction 
extended to the moon, the force at that distance would be of the 
exact magnitude necessary to retain the moon in its orbit. He 
found that the moon by her motion in her orbit was deflected from 
the tangent in every minute of time through a space of thirteen 
feet. But by observing the distance through which a body 
would fall in one second of time at the earth's surface, and by 
calculating from that on the supposition of the force diminishing 
in the ratio of the inverse square of the distance, he found that the 
earth's attraction at the distance of the moon would draw a 
body through 15 ft. in 1 min. Newton regarded the discrepancy 
between the results as a proof of the inaccuracy of his conjecture, 
and " laid aside at that time any further thoughts of this matter." 
But in 1679 a controversy between Hooke and Newton, about 
the form of the path of a body falling from a height, taking 
the motion of the earth round its axis into consideration, led 
Newton again to revert to his former conjectures on the moon. 
The measure of the earth, which had hitherto been accepted by 
geographers and navigators, was based on the very rough 
estimate that the length of a degree of latitude of the earth's 
surface measured along a meridian was 60 m. More accurate 
estimates had been made by R. Norwood and W. Snell, and more 
recently by P. Picard. At a meeting of the Royal Society on the 
uthof January 1672, Oldenburg the secretary read a letter from 
Paris describing the method followed by Picard in measuring a 
degree, and specifically stating the precise length that he 
calculated it to be. It is probable that Newton, had become 
acquainted with this measurement of Picard's, and that he was 
therefore led to make use of it when his thoughts were redirected 
to the subject. This estimate of the earth's magnitude, giving 
69-1 m. to i°, made the two results, the discrepancy between 
which Newton had regarded as a disproof of his conjecture, to 
agree so exactly that he now regarded his- conjecture as fully 
established. 

In January 1684 Sir Christopher Wren, Halley and- Hooke 
were led to discuss the law of gravity, and, although probably 
they all agreed in the truth of the law of the inverse square, 
yet this truth was not looked upon as established. It appears 
that Hooke professed to have a solution of the problem of the 
path of a body moving round a centre of force attracting as the 
inverse square of the distance; but Halley, finding, after a 
delay of some months, that Hooke " had not been so good as 
his word " in showing his solution to Wren, started in the month 
of August 1684 for Cambridge to consult Newton on the subject. 
Without mentioning the speculations which had been made, 
he asked Newton what would be the curve described by a planet 
round the sun on the assumption that the sun's force diminished 
as the square of the distance. Newton replied promptly, "an 
ellipse," and on being questioned by Halley as to the reason 
for his answer he replied, " Why, I have calculated it." He 
could not, however, put his hand upon his calculation, but he 
promised to send it to Halley. After the latter had left Cam- 
bridge, Newton set to work to reproduce the calculation. After 
making a mistake and producing a different result he corrected 
his work and obtained his former result. 

In the following November Newton redeemed his promise 
to Halley by sending him, by the hand of Mr Paget, one of 
the fellows of his own college, and at that time mathematical 
master of Christ's Hospital, a copy of his demonstration; and 
very soon afterwards Halley paid another visit to Cambridge 
to confer with Newton about the problem; and on his return 
to London on the 10th of December 1684, he informed the 
Royal Society " that he had lately seen Mr Newton at Cam- 
bridge, who had showed him a curious treatise De Motu" 
which at Halley's desire he promised to send to the Society to 
be entered upon their register. " Mr Halley was desired to put 
Mr Newton in mind of his promise for the securing this invention 
to himself, till such time as he could be at leisure to publish 
it," and Paget was desired to join with Halley in urging Newton 
to do so. By the middle of February Newton had sent his paper 
to Aston, one of the secretaries of the Society, and in a letter 
to Aston dated the 23rd of February 1685, we find Newton thank- 
ing him for " having entered on the register his notions about 
motion." This treatise De Motu was the germ of the Principia, 
and was obviously meant to be a short account of what that 
work was intended to embrace. It occupies twenty-four octavo 
pages, and consists of four theorems and seven problems, some 
of which are identical with some of the most important pro- 
positions of the second and third sections of the first book of 
the Principia, 

The years 1685 and 1686 will ever be memorable in the history 
of science. It was in them that Newton composed almost the 
whole of his great work. During this period Newton had a very 
extensive correspondence with John Flamsteed, who was then 
the astronomer-royal. Many of the letters are lost, but it is 
clear from one of Newton's, dated the 19th of September 1685, 
that he had received many useful communications from Flam- 
steed, and especially regarding Saturn, " whose orbit, as defined 
by Kepler," Newton " found too little for the sesquialterate 
proportions." In the other letters written in 1685 and 1686 
he applies to Flamsteed for information respecting the orbits 
of the satellites of Jupiter and Saturn, respecting the rise and 
fall of the spring and neap tides at the solstices and the equin- 
oxes, respecting the flattening of Jupiter at the poles (which, 
if certain, he says, would conduce much to the stating the reasons 
of the precession of the equinoxes), and respecting the difference 
between the observed places of Saturn and those computed 
from Kepler's tables about the time of his conjunction with 
Jupiter. On this last point the information supplied by Flam- 
steed was peculiarly gratifying to Newton; and it is obvious 
from the language of this part of his letter that he had still 
doubts of the universal application of the sesquialteral pro- 
portion. " Your information," he says, " about the errors of 
Kepler's tables for Jupiter and Saturn has eased me of several 
scruples. I was apt to suspect there might be some cause or 
other unknown to me which might disturb the sesquialteral 
proportions, for the influences of the planets one upon another 
seemed not great enough, though I imagined Jupiter's influence 
greater than your numbers determine it. It would add to my 
satisfaction if you would be pleased to let me know the long 
diameters of the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn, assigned by 
yourself and Mr Halley in your new tables, that I may see how 
the sesquialteral proportion fills the heavens, together with 
another small proportion which must be allowed for." 

Upon Newton's return from Lincolnshire in the beginning 
of April 1685, he seems to have devoted himself to the prepara- 
tion of his work. In the spring he had determined the attrac- 
tions of masses, and thus completed the law of universal gravi- 
tation. In the summer he had finished the second book of the 
Principia, the first book being the treatise De Motu, which 
he had enlarged and completed. Excepting in the correspond- 
ence with Flamsteed we hear nothing more of the preparation 
of the Principia until the 21st of April 1686, when Halley read 
to the Royal' Society his Discourse concerning Gravity and its 
Properties , in which he states " that his worthy countryman 
Mr Isaac Newton has an incomparable treatise of motion almost 
ready for the press," and that the law of the inverse square 
" is the principle on which Mr Newton has made out all the 
phenomena of the celestial motions so easily and naturally, 
that its truth is past dispute." At the next meeting of the 
Society, on the 28th of April, " Dr Vincent presented to the 
Society a manuscript treatise entitled Philosopkiae Naturalis 
Principia Mathematics and dedicated to the Society by Mr 
Isaac Newton." Although this manuscript contained only the 
first book, yet such was. the confidence the Society placed in the 
author that an order was given " that a letter of thanks be 
written to Mr Newton; and that the printing of his book be 
referred to the consideration of the council; and that in the 
meantime the book be put into the hands of Mr Halley, to 
make a report thereof to the council." Although there could 
be no doubt as to the intention of this report, yet no step was 
taken towards the publication of the work. At the next meeting 
of the Society, on the 19th of May, some dissatisfaction seems 
to have been expressed at the delay, as it was ordered " that Mr 
Newton's work should be printed forthwith in quarto, and that 
a letter should be written to him to signify the Society's resolu- 
tions, and to desire his opinion as to the print, volume, cuts 
and so forth." Three days afterwards Halley communicated 
the resolution to Newton, and stated to him that the printing 
was to be at the charge of the Society. At the next meeting 
of the council, on the 2nd of June, it was again ordered " that 
Mr Newton's book be printed," but, instead of sanctioning 
the resolution of the general meeting to print it at their charge, 
they added " that Mr Halley undertake the business of looking 
after it, and printing it at his own charge, which he engaged 
to do." 

In order to explain to Newton the cause of the delay, Halley in 
his letter of the 22nd of May alleges that it arose from " the 
president's attendance on the king, and the absence of the vice- 
presidents, whom the good weather had drawn out of town"; 
but there is reason to believe that this was not the true cause, and 
that the unwillingness of the council to undertake the publication 
arose from the state of the finances of the Society. Halley 
certainly deserves the gratitude of posterity for undertaking 
the publication of the work at a very considerable pecuniary 
risk to himself. In the same letter Halley found it necessary to 
inform Newton of Hooke's conduct when the manuscript of the 
Principia was presented to the Society. Sir John Hoskyns was 
in the chair when Dr Vincent presented the manuscript, and 
passed a high encomium on the novelty and dignity of the subject. 
Hooke was offended because Sir John did not mention what he 
had told him of his own discovery. Halley only communicated 
to Newton the fact " that Hooke had some pretensions to the 
invention of the rule for the decrease of gravity being reciprocally 
as the squares of the distances from the centre," acknowledging 
at the same time that, though Newton had the notion from him, 
" yet the demonstration of the curves generated thereby belonged 
wholly to Newton." " How much of this," Halley adds, " is 
so, you know best, so likewise what you have to do in this matter; 
only Mr Hooke seems to expect you should make some mention 
of him in the preface, which 'tis possible you may see reason to 
prefix. I must beg your pardon that 'tis I that send you this 
ungrateful account; but I thought it my duty to let you know 
it j so that you might act accordingly, being in myself fully satisfied 
that nothing but the greatest candour imaginable is to be ex- 
pected from a person who has Of all men the least need to borrow 
reputation." 

In thus appealing to Newton's candour, Halley obviously 
wished that some acknowledgment of Hooke should be made. 
He knew indeed that before Newton had announced the inverse 
law Hooke and Wren and himself had spoken of it and discussed 
it, and therefore justice demanded that, though none of them 
had given a demonstration of the law, Hooke especially should 
receive credit for having maintained it as a truth of which he 
was seeking the demonstration. On the 20th of June 1686 
Newton wrote to Halley the following letter: — 

" Sir, — In order to let you know the case between Mr Hooke and 
me, I give you an account of what passed between us in our letters, 
so far as I could remember; for 'tis long since they were writ, and 
I do not know that I have seen them since. I am almost confident by 
circumstances, that Sir Chr. Wren knew the duplicate proportion 

when I gave him a visit; and then Mr Hooke (by his book Cometa 
written afterwards) will prove the last of us three that knew it. I 
intended in this letter to let you understand the case fully; but it 
being a frivolous business, 1 shall content myself to give you the 
heads of it in short, viz. that I never extended the duplicate pro- 
portion lower than to the superficies of the earth, and before a certain 
demonstration I found the last year, have suspected it did not 
reach accurately enough down so low; and therefore in the doctrine 
of projectiles never used it nor considered the motions of the heavens ; 
and consequently Mr Hooke could not from my letters, which were 
about projectiles and the regions descending hence to the centre, 
conclude me ignorant of the theory of the heavens. That what he 
told me of the duplicate proportion was erroneous, namely, that it 
reached down from hence to the centre of the earth. 

" That it is not candid to require me now to confess myself, in 
print, then ignorant of the duplicate proportion in the heavens; 
for no other reason, but because he had told it me in the case of 
projectiles, and so upon mistaken grounds accused me of that ignor- 
ance. That in my answer to his first letter 1 refused his correspond- 
ence, told him 1 had laid philosophy aside, sent him [only the 
experiment of projectiles (rather shortly hinted than carefully 
described), in compliment to sweeten my answer, expected to hear no 
further from him; could scarce persuade myself to answer his second 
letter; did not answer his third, was upon other things; thought no 
further of philosophical matters than his letters put me upon it, and 
therefore may be allowed not to have had my thoughts of that kind 
about me so well at that time. That by the same reason he concludes 
me then ignorant of the rest of the duplicate proportion, he may as 
well conclude me ignorant of the rest of that theory 1 had read before 
in his books. That in one of my papers writ (I cannot say in what 
year, but I am sure some time before 1 had any correspondence with 
Air Oldenburg, and that's above fifteen years ago), the proportion of 
the forces of the planets from the sun, reciprocally duplicate of their 
distances from him, is expressed, and the proportion of our gravity 
to the moon's conatus recedendi a centro terrae is calculated, though 
not accurately enough. That whenHugenius put out his HoroL 
Oscil.j a copy being presented to me, in my letter of thanks to him 
1 gave those rules in the end thereof a particular commendation for 
their usefulness in Philosophy, and added out of my aforesaid paper 
an instance of their usefulness, in comparing the forces of the moon 
from the earth, and earth from the sun; in determining a problem 
about the moon's phase, and putting a limit to the sun's parallax, 
which shews that I had then my eye upon pom paring the forces of 
the planets arising from their circular motion, and understood it; 
so that a while after, when Mr Hooke propounded the problem 
solemnly, in the end of his attempt to prove the motion of the earth, 
if 1 had not known the duplicate proportion before, 1 could not but 
have found it now. Between ten and eleven years ago there was an 
hypothesis of mine registered in your books, wherein 1 hinted a 
cause of gravity towards the earth, sun and planets, with the de- 
pendence of the celestial motions thereon; in which the proportion 
of the decrease of gravity from the superficies of the planet (though 
for brevity's sake not there expressed) can be no other than re- 
ciprocally duplicate of the distance from the centre. And 1 hope I 
shall not be urged to declare, in print, that 1 understood not the 
obvious mathematical condition of my own hypothesis. But, grant 
I received it afterwards from Mr Hooke, yet have 1 as great a right 
to it as to the ellipsis. For as Kepler knew the orb to be not circular 
but oval, and guessed it to be elliptical, so Mr Hooke, without 
knowing what I have found out since his letters to me, can know no 
more, but that the- proportion was duplicate quant proxime at great 
distances from the centre, and only guessed it to be so accurately, 
and guessed amiss in extending that proportion down to the very 
centre, whereas Kepler guessed right at the ellipsis. And *so Mr 
Hooke found less of the proportion than Kepler of the ellipsis. 

" There is so strong an objection against the accurateness of this 
proportion, that without my demonstrations, to which Mr Hooke 
is yet a stranger, it cannot be believed by a judicious philosopher to 
be* any where accurate. And so, in stating this business, I do 
pretend to have done as much for the proportion as for the ellipsis, 
and to have as much right to the one from Mr Hooke and all men, 
as to the other from Kepler; and therefore on this account also he 
must at least moderate his pretences. 

" The proof you sent me f like very well. I designed the whole 
to consist of three books; the second was finished last summer being 
short, and only wants transcribing, and drawing the cuts fairly. 
Some new propositions I have since thought on, which I can as well 
let alone. The third wants the theory of comets. In autumn last I 
spent two months in calculations to no purpose for want of a good 
method, which made me afterwards return to the first book, and 
enlarge it with divers propositions, some relating to comets, others to 
other things, found out last winter. The third I now design to sup- 
press. Philosophy is such an impertinently litigious lady, that a 
man has as good be engaged in lawsuits, as have to do with her. t I 
found it so formerly, and now I am no sooner come near her again, 
but she gives me warning. The two first books, without the^ third, 
will not so well bear the title of Philosopkiae Naturalis Principia 
Mathematica; and therefore I had altered it to this, De Motu 
Corporum libri duo. 

" But, upon second thoughts, I retain the former title. 'Twill 
help the sale of the book, which I ought not to diminish now 'tis 
yours. The articles are, with the largest, to be called by that 
name; if you please you may change the word to sections, though 
it be not material. In the first page, I have struck out the words 
' uti posthac docebitur* as referring to the third book; which is 
all at present, from your affectionate friend, and humble servant, 

11 Is. Newton." 

On the 29th of June 1686 Halley wrote to Newton: — "I 
am heartily sorry that in this matter, wherein all mankind ought 
to acknowledge their obligations to you, you should meet with 
anything that should give you unquiet"; and then, after an 
account of Hooke 's claim to the discovery as made at a meeting 
of the Royal Society, he concludes: — 

" But I found that they were all of opinion that nothing thereof 
appearing in print, nor on the books of the Society, you ought to 
be considered as the inventor. And if in truth he knew it before 
you, he ought not to blame any but himself for having taken no 
more care to secure a discovery, which he puts so much value on. 
What application he has made in private, I know not; but I am 
sure that the Society have a very great satisfaction, in the honour 
you do them, by the dedication of so worthy a treatise. Sir, I 
must now again beg you, not to let your resentments run so high, 
as to deprive us of your third book, wherein the application of your 
mathematical doctrine to the theory of comets and several curious 
experiments, which, as I guess by what you write, ought to compose 
it, will undoubtedly render it acceptable to those, who will call 
themselves Philosophers without Mathematics, which are much 
the greater number. Now you approve of the character and paper, 
I will push on the edition vigorously. I have sometimes had thoughts 
of having the cuts neatly done in wood, so as to stand in the page 
with the demonstrations. It will be more convenient, and not much 
more charge. If it please you to have it so, I will try how well it can 
be done; otherwise I will have them in somewhat a larger size 
than those you have sent up. — I am, Sir, your most affectionate 
humble servant, E. Haixey." 

On the 30th of June 1686 the president was desired by the 
council to license Newton's book, entitled Philosopkiae Naturalis 
Principia Mathematica, 

On the 14th of July 1686 Newton wrote to Halley approving 
of his proposal to introduce woodcuts among the letterpress, 
stating clearly the different things which he had from Hooke, 
and adding, " And now having sincerely told you the case between 
Mr Hooke and me, I hope I shall be free for the future from the 
prejudice of his letters. I have considered how best to compose 
the present dispute, and I think it may be done by the inclosed 
scholium to the fourth proposition." This scholium was — 
" The inverse law of gravity holds in all the celestial motions, 
as was discovered also independently by my countrymen Wren, 
Hooke and Halley." After this letter of Newton's the printing 
of the Principia was begun. The second book, though ready for 
the press in the autumn of 1686, was not sent to the printers 
until March 1687. The third book was presented to the Society 
on the 6th of April 1687, and the whole work published about 
midsummer in that year. It was dedicated to the Royal Society, 
and to it was prefixed a set of Latin hexameters addressed by 
Halley to the author. The work, as might have been expected, 
caused a great deal of excitement throughout Europe, and the 
whole of the impression was very soon sold. In 1691 a copy of 
the Principia was hardly to be procured. 

While Newton was writing the second and third books of the 
Principia, a very important event occurred at Cambridge which 
had the effect of bringing him before the public in a new light. 
James II. had already, in 1686, in open violation of the law, 
conferred the deanery of Christ Church at Oxford on John 
Massey, a person whose sole qualification was that he was a 
member of the Church of Rome; and the king had boasted to the 
pope's legate that " what he had done at Oxford would very soon 
be done at Cambridge." In accordance with this boast, in 
February 1687 he issued a mandate directing that Father 
Alban Francis, a Benedictine monk, should be admitted a master 
of arts of the university of Cambridge, without taking the oaths 
of allegiance and supremacy. Upon receiving the mandamus 
Dr Pechell, the master of Magdalene College, who was vice- 
chancellor, sent a messenger to tbe duke of Albemarle, the 
chancellor, to request him to get the mandamus recalled; and 
the registrary and the bedells waited upon Francis to offer him 
instant admission to the degree if only he would take the necessary 
oaths. Both the king and the monk were inexorable. The court 
and the university were thus placed in open collision. A menacing 
letter was despatched by Sunderland to shake the firmness of 
the university; but, though humble and respectful explanations 
were returned, the university showed no sign of compliance, 
nor even of a desire to suggest a compromise. In consequence the 
vice-chancellor and deputies from the senate were summoned to 
appear before the High Commission Court at Westminster. 
Newton was one of the eight deputies appointed by the senate 
for this purpose. The deputies, before starting for London, held 
a meeting to prepare their case for the court. A compromise 
which was put forward by one of them was stoutly and success- 
fully resisted by Newton, and on the 21st of April the deputation, 
with their case carefully, prepared, appeared before the court. 
Lord Jeffreys presided at the board. The deputation appeared 
as a matter of course before the commissioners, and were dis- 
missed. On the 27th of April they gave in their plea. On the 
7th of May it was discussed, and feebly defended by the vice- 
chancellor. The deputies maintained that in the late reign 
several royal mandates had been withdrawn, and that no degree 
had ever been conferred without the oaths having been previously 
taken. Jeffreys spoke with his accustomed insolence to the vice- 
chancellor, silenced the other deputies when they offered to 
speak, and ordered them out of court. When recalled the deputies 
were reprimanded, and Pechell was deprived of his office as 
vice-chancellor, and of his emoluments as master of Magdalene. 
Newton returned to Trinity College to complete the Principia. 
While thus occupied he had an extensive correspondence with 
Halley, a very great part of which is extant. The following 
letter from Halley, dated London, July 5th, 1687, announcing 
the completion of the Principia, is of peculiar interest: — 

" I have at length brought your book to an end, and hope it will 
please you. The last errata came just in time to be inserted. I 
will present from you the book you desire to the Royal Society, 
Mr Boyle, Mr Paget, Mr Flamsteed, and if there be any else in town 
that you design to gratify that way ; and I have sent you to bestow 
on your friends in the University 20 copies, which I entreat you 
to accept. In the same^ parcel you will receive 40 more, which 
having no acquaintance in Cambridge, I must entreat you to put 
into the hands of one or more of your ablest booksellers to dispose 
of them. I intend the price of them, bound in calves' leather, and 
lettered, to be 9 shillings here. Those I send you I value in quires at 
6 shillings, to take my money as they are sold, or at 5 sh * for ready, 
or else at some short time; for I am satisfied there is no dealing in 
books without interesting the booksellers ; and I am contented to 
let them go halves with me, rather than have your excellent work 
smothered by their combinations. I hope you will not repent you 
of the pains you have taken in so laudable a piece, so much to your 
own and the nation's credit, but rather, after you shall have a little 
diverted yourself with other studies, that you will resume those 
contemplations wherein you had so great success, and attempt the 
perfection of the lunar theory, which will be of prodigious use in 
navigation, as well as of profound and public speculation. . . . You 
will receive a box from me on Thursday next by the waggon, that 
starts from town to-morrow.' , 

In 1692 and 1693 Newton seems to have had a serious illness, 
the nature of which has given rise to very considerable dispute. 
In a letter dated the 13th of September 1693, addressed to 
Samuel Pepys, he writes: — 

" Some time after Mr Millington had delivered your message, he 
pressed me to see you the next time J went to London. 1 was averse, 
but upon his pressing consented, before I considered what I did, for 
I am extremely troubled at the embroilment I am in, and have 
neither ate nor slept well this twelvemonth, nor have my former 
consistency of mind. I never designed to get any thing by your 
interest, nor by King James's favour, but am now sensible that I 
must withdraw from your acquaintance, and see neither you nor the 
rest of my friends any more, if I may but have them quietly. I beg 
your pardon for saying I would see you again, and rest your most 
humble and obedient servant." 

And in a letter written to John Locke in reply to one of his 
about the second edition of his book, and dated the 15th of 
October 1693, Newton wrote: — 

"The last winter, by sleeping too often by my fire, I got an ill 
habit of sleeping; and a distemper, which this summer has been 
epidemical, put me farther out of order, so that when I wrote to 
you, I had not slept an hour a night for a fortnight together, and 
for five days together not a wink. I remember I wrote to you, but 
what I said of your book I remember not. If you please to send 
me a transcript of that passage, I will give you an account of it if 
I can." 

The loss of sleep to a person of Newton's temperament, whose 
mind was never at rest, and at times so wholly engrossed in his 
scientific pursuits that he even neglected to take food, must 
necessarily have led to a very great deal of nervous excitability. 
It is not astonishing that rumours got abroad that there was a 
danger of his mind giving way, or, according to a report which 
was believed at the time, that it had actually done so. Pepys 
must have heard such rumours, as in a letter to his friend Milling- 
ton, the tutor of Magdalene College at Cambridge, dated the 26th 
of September 1693, he wrote: — 

" I must acknowledge myself not at the ease I would be glad to 
be at in reference to excellent Mr Newton; concerning whom 
(methinks) your answer labours under the same kind of restraint 
which (to tell you the truth) my asking did. For I was loth at first 
'dash to tell you that I had lately received a letter from him so 
surprising to me for the inconsistency of every part of it, as tobe 
put into great disorder by it, from the concernment I have for him, 
lest it should arise from that which of all mankind I should least 
dread from him and most lament for — I mean a discomposure^ in 
head, or mind, or both. Let me, therefore, beg you, Sir, having 
now told you the true ground of the trouble I lately gave you, to 
let me know the very truth of the matter, as far at least as comes 
within your knowledge." 

On the 30th of September 1693 Millington wrote to Pepys 
that he had been to look for Newton some time before, but that 
" he was out of town, and since," he says, 

" I have not seen him, till upon the 28th I met him at Huntingdon, 
where, upon his own accord, and before I had time to ask him any 
question, he told me that he had writt to you a very odd letter, at 
which he was much concerned; added, that it was in a distemper 
that much seized his head, and that kept him awake for above 
five nights together, which upon occasion he desired I would represent 
to you, and beg your pardon, he being very much ashamed he should 
be so rude to a person for whom he hath so great an honour. He is 
now very well, and though I fear he is under some small degree of 
melancholy, yet I think there is no reason to suspect it hath at all 
touched his understanding, and I hope never will; and so I am sure 
all ought to wish that love^ learning or the honour of our nation, which 
it is a sign how much it is looked after, when such a person as Mr 
Newton lyes so neglected by those in power. "__ 

The illness of Newton was very much exaggerated by foreign 
contemporary writers. In a manuscript journal of Huygens is to 
he found an entry; — 

" 29 Maj. 1694. — Narravit mihi D. Colm Scotus virum celeber- 
rimum ac summum geometram Is. Neutonum in phrenesin incidisse 
abhinc anno et sex mensibus. An ex nimia studii assiduitate, an 
dolore infortunii, quod incendio laboratorium chymicum et scripta 
quaedam amiserat ? Cum ad Archiepiscopum Cantabrigiensem 
venisset, ea locutum, quae alienationem mentis indicarent. Deinde 
ab amicis curam ejus susceptam, domoque clauso remedia volenti 
nolenti adhibita, quibus jam sanitatem recuperavit ut jam rursus 
librum suum Principiorum Philosophiae Mathematicorum intelligere 
incipiat." 

Huygens, in a letter dated the 8th of June 1694, wrote to 
Leibnitz, " I do not know if you are acquainted with the accident 
which has happened to the good Mr Newton, namely, that he has 
had an attack of phrenitis, which lasted eighteen months, 
and of which they say his friends have cured him hy means of 
remedies, and keeping him shut up." To which Leibnitz, in a 
letter dated the 22nd of June, replied, "lam very glad that I 
received information of the cure of Mr Newton at the same time 
that I first heard of his illness, which doubtless must have heen 
very alarming." 

The active part which Newton had taken in defending the legal 
privileges of the university against the encroachments of the 
crown had prohably at least equal weight with his scientific re- 
putation when his friends chose him as a candidate for a seat in 
parliament as one of the representatives of the university. The 
other candidates were Sir Robert Sawyer and Mr Finch. Sir 
Robert stood at the head of the poll with 125 votes, Newton 
next with 122 and Mr Finch was last with 117 votes. Newton 
retained his seat only about a year, from January 1689 till 
the dissolution of the Convention Parliament in February 1690. 
During this time Newton does not appear to have taken part in 
any of the dehates in the House; but he was not neglectful 
of his duties as a member. On the 30th of April 1689 he moved 
for leave to bring in a hill to settle the charters and privileges 
of the university of Cambridge, just as Sir Thomas Clarges did 
for Oxford at the same time, and he wrote a series of letters to Dr 
Lovel, the vice-chancellor of the university, on points which 
affected the interests of the university and its members. 

Some of the members of the university who had lately sworn 
allegiance to James had some difficulty in swearing allegiance 
to his successor. On the 12th of February 1689, the day of the 
coronation of William and Mary, Newton intimated to the vice- 
chancellor that he would soon receive an order to proclaim them 
at Cambridge. He enclosed a form of the proclamation, and 
expressed a hearty " wish that the university would so compose 
themselves as to perform the solemnity with a reasonable 
decorum." 

During his residence in London Newton had made the acquaint- 
ance of John Locke. Locke had taken a very great interest in the 
new theories of the Principia, He was one of a number of 
Newton's friends who began to be uneasy and dissatisfied at 
seeing the most eminent scientific man of his age left to depend 
upon the meagre emoluments of a college fellowship and a 
professorship. 

At one time Newton's friends had nearly succeeded in getting 
him appointed provost of King's College, Cambridge, but the 
college offered a successful resistance on the ground that the 
appointment would be illegal, as the statutes required that the 
provost should be in priest's orders. Charles Montague, who was 
afterwards earl of Halifax, was a fellow of Trinity College, and 
was a very intimate friend of Newton; and it was on his 
influence that Newton relied in the main for promotion to some 
post of honour and emolument. His hopes, however, were 
blighted hy long delay. In one of his letters to Locke at the 
beginning of 1692, when Montague, Lord Monmouth and Locke 
were exerting themselves to obtain some appointment for him, 
Newton wrote that he was " fully convinced that Mr Montague, 
upon an old grudge which he thought had been worn out, was 
false to him." Newton was now in his fifty-fifth year, and whilst 
those of his own standing at the university had been appointed 
to high posts in church or state, he still remained without any 
mark of national gratitude. But this blot upon the English 
name was at last removed by Montague in 1694, when he was 
appointed chancellor of the exchequer. He had previously con- 
sulted Newton upon the subject of the recoinage, and on the 
opportunity occurring he appointed Newton to the post of warden 
of the mint. In a letter to Newton announcing the news, 
Montague writes: — 

" I am very glad that at last I can give you a good proof of my 
friendship, and the esteem the king has of your merits. Mr Overton, 
the warden of the mint, is made one of the Commissioners of Customs, 
and the king has promised me to make Mr Newton warden of the 
mint. The office is the most proper for you. 'Tis the chief office 
in the mint : 'tis worth five or six hundred pounds per annum, and 
has not too much business to require more attendance than you can 
spare." 

This letter must have convinced Newton of the sincerity of 
Montague's good intentions towards him; we find them living 
as friends on the most intimate terms until Halifax's death in 
1715. 

Newton's chemical and mathematical knowledge proved of 
great use in carrying out the recoinage. This was completed in 
about two years. In 1697 Newton was appointed to the master- 
ship of the mint, a post worth between £1200 and £1500 per 
annum. While he held this office, Newton drew up a very 
extensive table of assays of foreign coins, and composed an 
official report on the coinage. 

Up to the time of the publication of the Principia in 1687 the 
method of fluxions which had been invented by Newton, and 
had been of great assistance to him in his mathematical investiga- 
tions, was still, except to Newton and his friends, a secret. 
One of the most important rules of the method forms the second 
lemma of the second book of the Principia. Though this new 
and powerful method was of great help to Newton in his work, he 
did not exhibit it in the results. He was aware that the well- 
known geometrical methods of the ancients would clothe his new 
creations in a garb which would appear less strange and uncouth 
to those not familiar with the new method. The Principia 
gives no information on the subject of the notation adopted in 
the new calculus, and it was not until 1693 that it was com- 
municated to the scientific world in the second volume of Dr 
Wallis's works. 

Newton's admirers in Holland had informed Dr Wallis that 
Newton's method of fluxions passed there under the name 
of Leibnitz's Calculus Differ entialis. It was therefore thought 
necessary that an early opportunity should be taken of asserting 
Newton's claim to be the inventor of the method of fluxions, and 
this was the reason for this method first appearing in Wallis's 
works. A further account of the method was given in the first 
edition of Newton's Optics, which appeared in 1 704. To this work 
were added two treatises, entitled Tractatus duo de speciebus et 
magnititdine figurarum curvilinearum, the one bearing the title 
Tractatus de Quadratura Curvarum, and the other Enumeratio 
linearum tertii ordinis. The first contains an explanation of the 
doctrine of fluxions, and of its application to the quadrature 
of curves; the second, a classification of seventy-two curves of 
the third order, with an account of their properties. The reason 
for publishing these two tracts in his Optics, from the subsequent 
editions of which they were omitted, is thus stated in the 
advertisement : — 

" In a letter written to M Leibnitz in the year 1679, and published 
by Dr Wallis, I mentioned a method by which I had found some 
general theorems about squaring curvilinear figures on comparing 
them with the conic sections, or other the simplest figures with which 
they might be compared. And some years ago I lent out a manu- 
script containing such theorems; and having since met with some 
things copied out of it, I have on this occasion made it public, pre- 
fixing to it an introduction, and joining a Scholium concerning that 
method. And I have joined with it another small tract concerning 
the curvilineal figures of the second kind, which was also written 
many years ago, and made known to some friends, who have solicited 
the making it public." 

In 1707 William Whiston published the algebraical lectures 
which Newton had delivered at Cambridge, under the title of 
Arithmetica Universalis, sive de Compositione et Resolutione 
Arithmetica Liber. We are not accurately informed how Whiston 
obtained possession of this work; but it is stated by one of the 
editors of the English edition " that Mr Whiston, thinking it a 
pity that so noble and useful a work should be doomed to a 
college confinement, obtained leave to make it public." It was 
soon afterwards translated into English by Raphson; and a 
second edition of it, with improvements by the author, was 
published at London in 1712, by Dr Machin, secretary to the 
Royal Society. With the view of stimulating mathematicians 
to write annotations on this admirable work, the celebrated 
's Gravesande published a tract, entitled Specimen Commentarii 
in Arithmeticam Universalem; and Maclaurin's Algebra seems 
to have been drawn up in consequence of this appeal. 

Newton's solution of the celebrated problems proposed by 
John Bernoulli and Leibnitz deserves mention among his mathe- 
matical works. In June 1696 Bernoulli addressed a letter to 
the mathematicians of Europe challenging them to solve two 
problems — (1) to determine the brachistochrone between two 
given points not in the same vertical line, (2) to determine a 
curve such that, if a straight line drawn through a fixed point 
A meet it in two points Pi, P 2 ,then AP! m +AP 2 m will be constant. 
This challenge was first made in the Acta Lipsiensia for June 
1696. Six months were allowed by Bernoulli for the solution of 
the problem, and in the event of none being sent to him he 
promised to publish his own. The six months elapsed without 
any solution being produced; but he received a letter from 
Leibnitz, stating that he had "cut the knot of the most beautiful 
of these problems," and requesting that the period for their 
solution should be extended to Christmas next, that the French 
'and Italian mathematicians might have no reason to complain 
of the shortness of the period. Bernoulli adopted the suggestion, 
and publicly announced the prorogation for the information of 
those who might not see the Acta Lipsiensia. 

On the 29th of January 1696/7 Newton received from 
France two copies of the printed paper containing the problems, 
and on the following day he transmitted a solution of them to 
Montague, then president of the Royal Society. He announced 
that the curve required in the first problem must be a cycloid, 
and he gave a method of determining it. He solved also the 
second problem, and he showed that by the same method other 
curves might be found which shall cut off three or more segments 
having the like properties. Solutions were also obtained from 
Leibnitz and the Marquis de L'H6pitaI; and, although that 
of Newton was anonymous, yet Bernoulli recognized the author 
in his disguise; " tanquam," says he, " ex ungue leonem." 

In 1699 Newton's position as a mathematician and natural 
philosopher was recognized by the French Academy of Sciences. 
In that year the Academy was remodelled, and eight foreign 
associates were created. Leibnitz, Domenico Guglielmim (1655- 
17 10), Hartsoeker, and E. W. Tschirnhausen were appointed on 
the 4th of February, James Bernoulli and John Bernoulli on 
the 14th of February, and Newton and Olaus Roemer on the 
21st of February. 

While Newton held the office of warden of the mint, he retained 
Ins chair of mathematics at Cambridge, and discharged the duties 
of the post, but shortly after he was promoted to be master of the 
mint he appointed Whiston his deputy with " the full profits of 
the place." Whiston began his astronomical lectures as Newton's 
deputy in January 1701. On the 10th of December 1701 Newton 
resigned his professorship, thereby at the same time resigning 
his fellowship at Trinity, which he had held with the Lucasian 
professorship since 1675 by virtue of the royal mandate. 
Whiston's claims to succeed Newton in the Lucasian chair were 
successfully supported by Newton himself. 

On the 26th of November 1701 Newton was again elected one 
of the representatives of the university in parliament, but he 
retained his seat only until the dissolution in the following July. 
Newton does not seem to have been a candidate at this election, 
but at the next dissolution in 1705 he was again a candidate for 
the representation of the university. He was warmly supported 
by the residents, but being a Whig in politics he was opposed hy 
the non-residents, and beaten by a large majority. ^ 

In the autumn of 1703 Lord Scmers retired from the presidency 
of the Royal Society, and Newton on the 30th of November 
1703 was elected to succeed him. " Newton was annually re- 
elected to this honourable post during the remainder of his life. 
He held the office in all twenty-five years, a period in which he 
has been exceeded by but one other president of the Royal 
Society, Sir Joseph Banks. As president Newton was brought 
into close connexion with Prince George of Denmark, the queen's 
husband, who had been elected a fellow of the Royal Society. 
The prince had offered, on Newton's recommendation, to be 
at the expense of printing Flamsteed's observations, and especi- 
ally his catalogue of the stars. It was natural that the queen 
' should form a high opinion of one whose merits had made such 
a deep impression on her husband. In April 1 705, when the queen, 
the prince and the court were staying at the royal residence at 
Newmarket, they paid a visit to Cambridge, where they were the 
guests of Dr Bentley, the master of Trinity. Her Majesty went 
in state to the Regent House, where a congregation of the senate 
was held, and a number of honorary degrees conferred. After- 
wards the queen held a court at Trinity Lodge, where (16th 
of April 1705) she conferred the order of knighthood upon Sir 
Isaac Newton. 

As soon as the first edition of the Principia was published 
Newton began to prepare for a second edition. He was anxious 
to improve the work by additions to the theory of the motion of 
the moon and the planets. Dr Edleston, in bis preface to 
Newton's correspondence with Cotes, justly remarks: — 

" If Flamsteed the Astronomer-Royal had cordially co-operated 
with him in the humble capacity of an observer in the way that 
Newton pointed out and requested of him . . . the lunar theory 
would, if its creator did not overrate his own powers, have been 
completely investigated, so far as he could do it, in the first few 
months of 1695, and a second edition of the Principia would probably 
have followed the execution of the task at no long interval." 

Newton, however, could not get the information he wanted 
from Flamsteed, and after the spring of 1696 his time was much 
occupied by his duties at the mint. Rumours, however, of his 
work, and of a new edition, were heard from time to time. In 
February 1700 Leibnitz writes of Newton, " J'ai appris aussi 
(je ne scai ou) qu'il donnera encore quelque chose sur le mouve- 
ment de la lune: et on m'a dit aussi qu'il y auraune nouvelle 
edition de ses principes de la nature." 

Dr Bentley, the master of Trinity College, had for a long time 
urged Newton to give his consent to the republication of the 
Principia. In the middle of 1 70S Newton's consent was obtained, 
but it was not till the spring of 1 709 that he was prevailed upon 
to entrust the superintendence of it to a young mathematician 
■ of great promise, Roger Cotes, fellow of Trinity College, who had 
been recently appointed the first Plumian professor of astronomy 
and experimental philosophy. On the 21st of May 1709, after 
having been that day with Newton, Bentley announced this 
arrangement to Cotes: — " Sir Isaac Newton," he said, " will be 
glad to see you in June, and then put into your hands one part 
of his book corrected for the press." About the middle of July 
Cotes went to London, in the expectation doubtless to bring down 
with him to Cambridge the corrected portion of the Principia. 
Although Cotes was impatient to begin his work, it was nearly the 
end of September before the corrected copy was put into his hands. 

During the printing of this edition a correspondence went on 
continuously between Newton and Cotes. On the 31st of March 
17 13, when the edition was nearly ready for publication, Newton 
wrote to Cotes: — 

" I heare that Mr Bernoulli has sent a Paper of 40 pages to be 
published in the Acta Leipsica relating to what I have written upon 
the curve Lines described by Projectiles in resisting Mediums. And 
therein he partly makes Observations upon what I have written & 
partly improves it. To prevent being blamed by him or others for 
any disingenuity in not acknowledging my oversights or slips in the 
first edition, I believe it will not be amiss to print next after the old 
Praefatio ad Lector em ^ the following account ot this new Edition. 

" * In hac secunda Principiorum Editione, multa sparsim emen- 
dantur & nonnulla adjiciuntur.^ In Libri primi Sect. ii. In vent 10 
virium quibus corpora in Orbibus datis revolvi possint, facilior

"'28 Mar. 1713. I. N.* 

" If you write any further Preface, I must not see it, for I find 
that I shall be examined about it. The cuts for v« Comet of 1680 & 
1681 are printed off and will be sent to Dr Bently this week by the 
Carrier." 

Newton's desire to have no hand in writing the preface seems 
to have proceeded from a knowledge that Cotes was proposing 
to allude to the dispute about the invention of fluxions. At 
last, about midsummer 1713, was published the long and im- 
patiently expected second edition of the Principia, and, on the 
27th of July, Newton waited on the queen to present her with 
a copy of the new edition. 

In 1714 the question of finding the longitude at sea, which 
had been looked upon as an important one for several years, 
was brought into prominence by a petition presented to the 
House of Commons by a number of captains of Her Majesty's 
ships and merchant ships and of London merchants. The 
petition was referred to a committee of the House, who called 
witnesses. Newton appeared before them and gave evidence. 
He stated that for determining the longitude at sea there had 
been several projects, true in theory but difficult to execute. 
He mentioned four: (1) by a watch to keep time exactly, (2) 
by the eclipses of Jupiter's satellites, (3) by the place of the 
moon, (4) by a new method proposed by Mr Dit ton. Newton 
criticized all the methods, pointing out their weak points, and 
it is due mainly to his evidence that the committee brcught 
in the report which was accepted by the House, and shortly 
afterwards was converted into a Bill, passed both Houses, and 
^received the royal assent. The report ran " that it is the opinion 
of this committee that a reward be settled by parliament upon 
such person or persons as shall discover a more certain and 
practicable method of ascertaining the longitude than any yet 
in practice; and the said reward be proportioned to the degree 
of exactness to which the said method shall reach." 

Sir Isaac Newton was a very popular visitor at the court 
of George I. The princess of Wales, af terwards Queen Caroline, 
wife of George II., took every opportunity of conversing with 
him. Having one day been told by Sir Isaac that he had com- 
posed a new system of chronology while he was still resident 
at Cambridge, she requested him to give her a copy. He accord- 
ingly drew up an abstract of the system from his papers, and 
sent it to the princess for her own private use; but he after- 
wards allowed a copy to be made for the Abbe Conti on the 
express understanding that it should not be communicated to 
any other person. The abbe, however, lent his copy to M 
Freret, an antiquary at Paris, who translated it, and endeavoured 
to refute it. The translation was printed under the title AbrigS 
de chronologic de M le Chevallier Newton, fait par lui-mime et 
traduit sur le manuscrit anglais. Upon receiving a copy of this 
work, Sir Isaac Newton printed, in the Philosophical Trans- 
actions for 1725, a paper entitled " Remarks on the observations 
made on a Chronological Index of Sir Isaac Newton, translated 
into French by the observator, and published at Paris." In these 
remarks Sir Isaac charged the abbe with a breach of promise, 
and gave a triumphant answer to the objections which Freret 
had urged against his system. Father Souciet entered the field 
in defence of Freret; and in consequence of this controversy 
Sir Isaac was induced to prepare his larger work, which was 
published in 1728, after his death, and entitled The Chronology 
of Ancient Kingdoms amended, to which is prefixed a short Chronicle 
from the First Memory of Kings in Europe to the Conquest of 
Persia by Alexander the Great. 

From an early period of his life Newton had paid great atten- 
tion to theological studies, and it is well known that he had 
begun to study the subject of the prophecies before the year 
1690. M Biot, with a view of showing that his theological 
writings were the productions of his dotage, has fixed their 
date between 171 2 and 1719. That Newton's mind was even 
then quite clear and powerful is sufficiently proved by his ability 
to attack the most difficult mathematical problems with success. 
For it was in 17 16 that Leibnitz, in a letter to the Abbe* Conti, 
proposed a problem for solution "for the purpose of feeling 
the pulse of the English analysts." The problem was to find 
the orthogonal trajectories of a series of curves represented 
by a single equation. Newton received this problem about 
5 o'clock in the afternoon as he was returning from the mint, 
but, though he was fatigued with business, he solved the problem 
the same evening. 

One of the most remarkable of Sir Isaac's theological pro- 
ductions is his Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions 
of the Scripture, in a letter to a friend. This friend was Locke, 
who received the letter in November 1600. Sir Isaac seems 
to have been then anxious for its publication; but, as the effect 
of his argument was to deprive the Trinitarians of two passages 
in favour of the Trinity, he became alarmed at the probable 
consequences of such a step. He therefore requested Locke, 
who was then going to Holland, to get it translated into French, 
and published on the continent. Being prevented from going 
to Holland, Locke copied the manuscript, and sent it, without 
Newton's name, to Le Gere, who received it before the nth 
of April 1 691. On the 20th of January 1692 Le Gere announced 
to Locke his intention to publish the pamphlet in Latin; and, 
upon the intimation of this to Sir Isaac, he entreated him " to 
stop the translation and impression as soon as he could, for 
he designed to suppress them." This was accordingly done; 
but Le Gere sent the manuscript to the library of the Remon- 
strants, and it was afterwards published at London in 1754, 
under the title of Two Letters from Sir Isaac Newton to M le 
Clerc. This edition is imperfect, and in many places erroneous. 
Dr Horsley therefore published a genuine one, which is in the 
form of a single letter to a friend, and was taken from a manu- 
script in Sir Isaac's own hand. 

Sir Isaac Newton left behind him in manuscript a work en- 
titled Observations on the Prophecies of Daniel and the Apocalypse 
of St John, which was published in London in 1733, in one 
volume 4to; another work, entitled Lexicon Propheticum, 
with a dissertation on the sacred cubit of the Jews, which was 
printed in 1737; and four letters addressed to Bentley, con- 
taining some arguments in proof of a Deity, which were published 
by Cumberland, a nephew of Bentley, in 1756. Sir Isaac also 
left a Church History complete, a History of the Creation, Para- 
doxical Questions regarding A thanasius, and many divinity 
tracts. 

Newton devoted much of his time to the study of chemistry; 
but the greater number of his experiments still remain in manu- 
script. His Tabula Quantilatum el Graduum Caloris contains 
a comparative scale of temperature from that of melting ice 
to that of a small kitchen fire. He wrote also another chemical 
paper Be Natura Acidorum, which has been published by Dr 
Horsley. Sir Isaac spent much time in the study of the works 
of the alchemists. He had diligently studied the works of 
Jacob Boehme, and there were found amongst his manuscripts 
copious abstracts from them in his own handwriting. In the 
earlier part of his life he and his relation Dr Newton of Grantham 
had put up furnaces, and had wrought for several months in 
quest of the philosopher's tincture. Among the manuscripts 
in the possession of the earl of Portsmouth there are many 
sheets in Sir Isaac's hand of Flamsteed's Explication of Hiero- 
glyphic Figures, and in another hand many sheets of William 
Yworth's Processus Mysterii Magni Philosophicus. 

In the last few years of his life Newton was troubled with 
incontinence of urine, which was supposed to be due to stone; 
but with care he kept the disease under control. In January 
1725 he was seized with a violent cough and inflammation of 
the lungs, which induced him to reside at Kensington; and 
in the following month he had a severe attack of gout, which 
produced a decided improvement in his general health. His 
duties at the mint were discharged by John Conduitt, and he 
therefore seldom went from home. On the 28th of February 
1727, feeling well, he went to London to preside at a meeting 
of the Royal Society; but the fatigue which attended this 
duty brought on a violent return of his former complaint, and 
he returned to Kensington on the 4th of March, when Dr Mead 
and Dr Chesselden pronounced his disease to be stone. He 
endured the sufferings of this complaint with wonderful patience. 
He seemed a little better on the 15th of March, and on the 18th 
he read the newspapers and conversed with Dr Mead; but 
at 6 o'clock in the evening he became insensible, and continued 
in that state till Monday the 20th of March 1727, when he 
expired without pain between one and two o'clock in the morning. 
His body was removed to London, and on Tuesday the 28th of 
March it lay in state in the Jerusalem Chamber, and was thence 
conveyed to Westminster Abbey, where it was buried.

NEWTON, JOHN (17 2 5-1 807), English divine, was born in 
.London on the 24th of July 172s (O.S.). His father, who for a 
long time was master of a ship in the Mediterranean trade, 
became in 1748 governor of York Fort, Hudson Bay, where 
he died in 1751. The lad had little education and served on his 
father's ship from 1737 to 1742; shortly afterwards he was 
impressed on board a man-of-war, the " Harwich," where he 
was made a midshipman. For an attempt to escape while his 
ship lay off Plymouth he was degraded, and treated with so 
much severity that he gladly exchanged into an African trader. 
He made many voyages as mate and then as master on slave- 
trading ships, devoting his leisure to the improvement of his 
education. The state of his health and perhaps a growing dis- 
taste for the slave trade led him to quit the sea in 1755, when 
he was appointed tide-surveyor at Liverpool. He began to 
study Greek and Hebrew, and in 1758 applied to the archbishop 
of York for ordination. This was refused him, but, having had 
the curacy of Olney offered to him in April 1764 he was ordained 
by the bishop of Lincoln. In October 1767 William Cowper 
settled in the parish. An intimate friendship sprang up between 
the two men, and they published together the Olney Hymns 
(1779). In 1779 Newton left Olney to become rector of St 
Mary Woolnoth, London, where he laboured with unceasing 
diligence and great popularity till his death on the 31st of 
December 1807. 

Like Cowper, Newton held Calvinistic views, although his 
evangelical fervour allied him closely with the sentiments of 
Wesley and the Methodists. His fame rests on certain of the 
Olney Hymns (e.g. " Glorious things of Thee are spoken," 
" How sweet the name of Jesus sounds," " One there is above all 
others,") remarkable for vigour, simplicity and directness of 
devotional utterance. 

His prose works include an Authentic Narrative of some Interesting 
and Remarkable Particulars in the Life of John Newton (1764), a 
volume of Sermons (1767), Omicron (a series of letters on religion, 
1774), Review of Ecclesiastical History (1769) and Cardiphonia (1781). 
This last was a further selection of religious correspondence, which 
did much to help the Evangelical revival. Thomas Scott, William 
Wilberforce, Charles Simeon, William Jay and Hannah More all 
came under his direct influence. His Letters to a Wife (1793) and 
Letters to Rev. W. Bull (posthumous, 1847) illustrate the frankness 
with which he exposed his most intimate personal experiences. _ A 
Life of Newton by Richard Cecil was prefixed to a collected edition 
of his works (6 vols., 1808; 1 vol. 1827). See also T. Wright, The 
Town of Cowper. 


NEWTON, JOHN (1823-1895), American general and engineer, 
was born in Norfolk, Virginia, on the 24th of August 1823, and 
graduated second in his class at the U.S. Military Academy 
in 1842. From 1842 to 1861 he was engaged in the construction 
of coast defences and the improvement of waterways; he was 
assistant professor of engineering in the Military Academy 
from 1843 to 1846, became a captain in 1856, and took part as 
chief engineer in the Utah expedition of 1 857-1 858. He served 
as an engineer in the Virginian campaign of 1861, and was 
promoted brigadier-general, U.S.V., in September. He 
especially distinguished himself in the Seven Days 1 battle and at 
Antietam, and after the battle of Fredericksburg was made 
major-general, U.S.V. In the Chancellorsville campaign Newton 
took part in the storming of Marye's Heights at Fredericksburg, 
on the 3rd of May 1863, and at the battle of Gettysburg he was 
for a time in command of the I. corps. He had already received 
the brevet of lieutenant-colonel for his services at Antietam, 
and he now became brevet colonel for his services at Gettysburg. 
Later he was transferred to Sherman's army, and as a division 
commander under General Oliver 0. Howard took part in the 
Atlanta campaign. For gallant conduct at Peach Tree Creek 
he was made brevet brigadier-general, and at the close of the 
war was made brevet major-general, U.S.A. Returning to 
regular engineering duty after the war, he was stationed at New 
York from 1866 to 1884. His most important work there was 
the improvement of the Hudson river, and especially the 
removal of the obstructions to shipping in the dangerous entrance 
to the East river from Long Island Sound, known as Hell Gate. 
Under two of the largest obstructions — Hallet's Point and Flood 
Rock, with a surface of three acres and nine acres respectively — 
shafts were sunk from the shore, and tunnels were bored in every 
direction. In these tunnels thousands of pounds of explosives 
were placed, and the rocks were blown into fragments. In 
March 1884 he became Chief of Engineers, with the rank of 
brigadier-general, and held this position until his retirement 
from the army, at his own request, in August 1886. In 1887-1888 
he was commissioner of public works in New York City, and 
from 1888 until his death, on the 1st of May 1895, he was president 
of the Panama railway. 


NEWTON, a city and the county-seat of Harvey county, 
Kansas, U.S.A., about 27 m. N. of Wichita. Pop. (1905)6601; 
(1910) 7862. It is served by the Atchison, Topeka & Santa 
Fe (of which it is a division point and which has shops here), 
and the Missouri Pacific railways. Newton is the centre of the 
settlements of the German-Russian Mennonites, a thrifty people, 
who immigrated in 1873 and subsequently; Bethel College 
(opened 1893) is a Mennonite secondary school, and there is a 
Mennonite hospital. Newton is a supply and distributing point 
for the surrounding agricultural and stock-raising region, and 
has various manufactures. The municipality has natural gas for 
heating, lighting and manufacturing. Newton was first settled 
in 187 r, was chartered as a city in 1872, and in 1910 adopted 
a commission form of government. 


NEWTON, a city of Middlesex county, Massachusetts, U.S.A., 
10 m. W. of Boston, on the S. bank of the Charles river, which 
borders it for 16 m. Pop. (1880) 16,995; (1890) 24,379; (1900) 
33>S87, of whom 10,068 were foreign-born, 19,006 of foreign 
parentage and 505 were negroes; (19 10, census) 39,806. 
Newton is served by the Boston & Albany railway. The city, 
with an area of 17-98 sq. m., contains 15 villages. In Newton, 
the most prominent of these villages, is a stone terrace monu- 
ment to John Eliot, erected on the site of Waban's wigwam 
near Nonantum Hill, where Eliot founded the first Indian Church 
on the 28th of October 1646 — the Nonantum Indians, under 
their chief Waban, removed to Natick in 1651. On Institution 
Hill, Newton Centre, is the first Baptist theological seminary 
in America, Newton Theological Institution, founded in 1825. 
Here also is the residence of Samuel Francis Smith (1 808-1 895), 
author of " America " and several missionary hymns, and pastor 
here in 1842-1854. In Newton Upper Falls, Echo Bridge (of 
the Boston Aqueduct) crosses the Charles near the falls in 
Hemlock Gorge Reservation of the Metropolitan Park system. 
Auburndale is the seat of Lasell Seminary for Young Women, 
founded in 1851 by Edward Lasell (1809-1852). Other of the 
villages are Newtonville, West Newton and Newton Highlands. 
The city of Newton is primarily a residential suburb of Boston; 
along the Charles is a part (191*12 acres) of the Charles River 
Reservation of the Metropolitan Park system, and the city has 
several attractive public parks, including Norumbega Park, 
on the banks of the river, with a large open-air theatre; boating, 
especially canoeing, on the river is very popular. The city has 
a public library, a high school and a technical high school. 
Among its manufactures are foundry and machine shop products, 
worsted goods and electrical apparatus; the factories utilize 
the water power of the falls. The value of the manufactured 
product in 1905 was $4,140,996. The region was settled as a 
part of Cambridge in 1630 and was called South Side (i.e. of the 
Charles), Nonantum (the Indian name), Cambridge Village, 
Little Cambridge or New Cambridge; in 1688 it was incorporated 
as a separate town and in 1691 received its present name; it 
annexed an island in the Charles in 1803; parts of it were 
annexed to Roxbury (1838) and Waltham (1849); it hecame a 
city in 1873; and in 1875 it annexed a part of Boston, with which 
there have been several more recent boundary adjustments. 


NEWTON ABBOT, a market town and seaport in the Ash- 
burton parb'amentary division of Devonshire, England, 20 m. 
S. by W. of Exeter by the Great Western railway. Pop. of 
urban district (1901) 12,517. Beautifully situated at the head 
of the Teign estuary, the town grew rapidly in the 19th century. 
The two parish churches, St Mary's in Wolborough, and All 
Saints' in Highweek, are Perpendicular in style. St Mary's 
contains a Norman font, an ancient brass lectern, buried during 
the Civil Wars, and some interesting heraldic ornaments which 
date from the 15th century. Of the 14th century chapel of St 
Leonard, only a tower survives. A large nunnery, called St 
Augustine's Priory, was erected near the town in r86r; while 
eastward is the Jacobean Forde House, belonging to the earl 
of Devon, and visited by Charles I. and William of Orange, 
who first read his declaration to the people of England at Newton 
Abbot market-cross. The establishment of large engine works 
by the Great Western railway has aided the development of 
local industries, and there is a considerable shipping trade, 
fine china clay and pipeclay being worked near the towns and 
exported to the Potteries. Large fairs are held for the sale of 
agricultural produce and livestock. The portion of Newton 
Abbot in the parish of Highweek was formerly a separate town, 
known as Newton Bushel. 

Probably both Newton Abbot and Newton Bushel were 
originally included under the name of Newton. Newton Abbot 
was given to the abbot of Tor by William Lord Brewer, founder 
of the monastery (1196). Newton Bushel was so called from 
Robert Bussell or Bushel, foster-child and kinsman of Theobald 
de Englishville, who was made lord of the manor by -Henry III. 
in 1246. 


NEWTON-IN-MAKERFIELD, or Newton-le-Willows, an 
urban district in the Newton parliamentary division of Lanca- 
shire, England, 15J m. W. of Manchester by the London & 
North-Western railway. Pop. (1891) 12,861; (1901) 16,699. 
At a short distance from the town is a moated Elizabethan 
half-timbered house, and also an ancient barrow of great extent. 
The Liverpool farm reformatory school is in the neighbourhood. 
The industrial establishments include foundries, printing and 
stationery works, paper mills, glass works and sugar refineries. 
Coal abounds in the neighbourhood. . 

The township of Newton-in-Makerfield, gave its name in 
Saxon times and in the reign of William the Conqueror tc* one 
of the hundreds of Lancashire. The barony was held by Hhe 
Banastres from the conquest to 1286 and passed successively 
to the Langtons, Fleetwoods and Leghs. It does not seem that 
the barons were ever summoned to parliament, and the title, 
like all parliamentary titles, has fallen into disuse since the 
abolition of feudal tenures. The courts-baron and courts-leet 
are held twice annually. The township returned two members 
to parliament from 1559 to 1831, but was disfranchised by the 
Reform Act of 1832. There was a market here at least as early 
as 1558 which is now discontinued. Near the town a party of 
Highlanders were taken prisoners in 1648 by Cromwell's troops, 
and hanged in an adjoining wood, still called Gallow's Cross. 


NEWTOWN, a municipality of Cumberland county, New 
South Wales, Australia, 3? m. S.W. of Sydney. It consists 
chiefly of the residences of the wealthier citizens of Sydney and 
is connected with the city by rail and tram. As a municipality 
it dates from 1862. Pop (1001) 22,598. 


NEWTOWN (Welsh Drefnewydd, with the same meaning, 
formerly Uanfair Cedewain), a market town and contributory 
parliamentary borough of Montgomeryshire, situated on both 
sides of the Severn, and on the Cambrian railway, 195 m. from 
London. Pop. of urban district of Newtown and Llanllwchhaiarn 
(1001) 6500. It is connected with Shrewsbury (Amwyihig) 
by the Montgomeryshire canal. The old Anglican church, 
partly Decorated and partly Perpendicular, has been superseded 
by the modern St Mary's, which contains the font and rood-screen 
of the old building. In the old churchyard lies Robert Owen, 
horn in 1771 at Newtown, where he died in 1858, known as 
" the patriarch of reason," author of New Views of Society, &c, 
and one of the fathers of communism. Newtown, rather than 
Welshpool, is the chief seat of Welsh flannel manufacture, 
together with that of tweeds and shawls. It joins with Welshpool, 
Llanfyllin, Montgomery (Trefaldwyn) , Llanidloes and Machynl- 
leth, in returning a member to parliament. 

NEWTOWNARDS (pron. Newton&rds), a market town of 
Co. Down, Ireland, beautifully situated near the northern 
extremity of Strangford Lough, on a branch of the Belfast and 
Co. Down railway, g\ m. E. of Belfast. Pop. (1 001) 91 10. The 
town is sheltered by the Scrabo Hills on the west and north, and 
possesses a fine square, in which the pedestal of an ancient cross 
was erected in 1636. Muslin embroidery is the principal industry. 
There are also mills for flax and hemp yarns, a weaving factory 
and a hosiery factory. The remains of the old church, originally 
erected in 1244, contain good Perpendicular work, and the 
family vault of the Londonderry's; there are also the parish 
church and Presbyterian church, with lofty spires, and a Roman 
Catholic chapel. In the neighbourhood there are freestone 
quarries. 

The town owes its origin to a Dominican monastery founded 
in 1244 by Walter de Burgh. It was forfeited by the O'Neills, 
and given to the Hamiltons and Montgomeries, from whom it 
passed to the marquess of Londonderry. It received a charter 
from James I., and until the Union in 1800 returned two members 
to parliament. The ruined abbey of Moville, if m. N.E., is 
the most notable of the many ecclesiastical remains in the 
neighbourhood. It is attributed to St Finian (c. 550). 


NEW ULM, a city and the county seat of Brown county, 
Minnesota, U.S.A., on the S. bank of the Minnesota river, 
88 m. (by rail) S.W. of Minneapolis, in the south central part 
of the state. Pop. (1905, state census) 5720 (1287 of German 
birth); (1910) 5648. New Ulm is served by the Minne- 
apolis & St Louis, and. the 'Chicago & North Western railways. 
In the south-western part of the city, on a wooded hill called 
Hermann Heights, there is a statue of Arminius erected by the 
Grand Lodge of Hermann's Sons of the United States. New 
Ulm is an important livestock market. The city is the seat of 
the Dr Martin Luther College (Lutheran, 1884), a secondary 
school, with a normal and a collegiate department. St Michael's 
Academy and St Alexander Hospital are under the charge of 
Roman Catholic sisters. New Ulm was settled about 1853, 
and was twice attacked and almost destroyed by the Indians 
during the Sioux uprising of 1862. There is a monument to 
those who lost their lives in the Sioux massacres. 


NEW WASHINGTON, a town of the province of Capiz, island 
of Panay, Philippine Islands, on the N. coast about 17 m. W. 
of Capiz, the capital of the province. The town was formed in 
1903 by uniting the towns of Batan, Jimeno, Balete and the 
village or barrio of Lagatic in the town of Calibo; the total 
population at that time was 24,480. There are about sixty-six 
barrios, but all of these except Lagatic, the seat of the municipal 
government, had in 1903 less than 1000 inhabitants. The 
language is Visayan. The cultivation of rice, sugar cane, hemp, 
and Indian corn and the raising of cattle and horses are the 
principal industries. 


NEW WESTMINSTER, a city on the north bank of the Fraser 
river, British Columbia, 15 m. from the mouth. Pop. (1906 
estimate) 7000. Founded in 1859 it was the capital of British 
Columbia when the British possessions on the Pacific coast 
formed two colonies — ix. British Columbia (the mainland 
portion) and Vancouver Island. The city is accessible to ocean- 
going ships of 16 ft. draught. It is the chief centre of the farming 
country of the lower Fraser and has a small export lumber trade. 
In 1898 the greater portion of the business part of the city was 
destroyed by fire, and though much of it was rebuilt, the estab- 
lishment of the city of Vancouver, only 12 m. distant, seriously 
affected its growth. It is connected with Vancouver by an 
electric railway. The Great Northern railway, connecting with 
Seattle and* other points in the state of Washington, here crosses 
the Fraser river by a fine bridge. 


NEW YEAR'S DAY, the first day of the year. In the Gregorian 
calendar this date occurs twelve days earlier than in the Julian ; 
thus in Russia, Greece, &c, where the latter is still employed, 
New Year's Day is celebrated on the English 13th of January. 

The ancient Egyptians, Phoenicians and Persians began their 
year at the autumnal equinox (Sept. 21) and the Greeks until 
the 5th century B.C. at the winter solstice (Dec. 21). In 432 B.C. 
the latter altered their New Year's Day to the 21st of June. 
The ancient Romans celebrated the beginning of the year on the 
21st of December, but Caesar by the adoption of the Julian 
calendar postponed it to the 1st of January. The Jews have 
always reckoned their civil year from the first day of the month 
of Tishri (Sept. 6-Oct. 5), but their ecclesiastical year begins at 
the spring equinox (March 21). The 25th of March was the 
usual date among most Christian peoples in early medieval days. 
In Anglo-Saxon England, however, the 25th of December was 
New Year's Day. At the Norman Conquest owing, it is believed, 
to the coincidence of his coronation being arranged for that date, 
William the Conqueror ordered that the year should start on the 
1st of January. But later England began her year with the rest 
of Christendom on the 25th of March. The Gregorian calendar 
(1582), which restored the 1st of January to its position as New 
Year's Day, was accepted by all Catholic countries at once; 
by Germany, Denmark and Sweden about 1700, but not until 
17 5 1 by England. 

The Romans, after the adoption of the Julian calendar, kept 
the 1st of January as a general holiday. Sacrifices were made to 
Janus; gifts and visits were exchanged, and masquerading and 
feasting were general. Congratulatory presents were made to 
the magistrates who entered upon office on this day. The 
emperors at the new year exacted from their subjects tribute of 
a pound of gold. This quasi-present was called strena, a term 
(extended to all New Year's gifts in Rome) traditionally derived 
from a custom initiated by the legendary King Tatius, to whom 
branches of vervain gathered in the sacred Grove of Strenua, 
the goddess of strength, were presented as a good omen on the 
first day of the year 747 B.C. The imperial strenae later became 
so excessive that Claudius found it necessary to limit the amount 
by formal decree. 

Participation in the ordinary New Year's Day observances 
as well as in the Saturnalia of December was from the first 
discouraged by the Church. Christians were expected to spend 
the day in quiet meditation, reading of scripture and acts of 
charity. When about the 5th century the 25th of December 
had become a fixed festival commemorative of the Nativity, 
the 1st of January assumed a specially sacred character as the 
octave of Christmas Day and as the anniversary of the Circum- 
cision. As such it still figures in the calendars of the various 
branches of the Eastern and Western Church, though only as a 
feast of subordinate importance. The first mention of it in 
Christian literature as a feast occurs in Canon 17 of a council 
which met at Tours in 567. 

The custom of giving and receiving strenae for luck at the New 
Year survives in France (where New Year's Day is known as 
le jour d'dtrennes) and the Continent generally. In England its 
place has been taken by the Christmas-gift. In Scotland, where 
New Year's Day is more generally observed than Christmas, 
the custom is still universal. The Persians celebrated the begin- 
ning of the year by exchanging presents of eggs. The Druids 
distributed as New Year's gifts branches of the sacred mistletoe. 
In Anglo-Saxon and Norman England New Year's gifts were 
common. According to Matthew Paris, Henry III. followed the 
Roman precedent by extorting New Year's gifts from his subjects. 
These in later reigns became voluntary but none the less obli- 
gatory on those who wished to stand well with the throne. The 
custom reached its climax in Tudor times. Wolsey one New Year 
gave Henry VIII. a gold cup valued at £117, 17s. 6d. in the 
coinage of that time. An MS. account is preserved of money 
gifts given to King Henry by all classes of his subjects on New 
Year's Day 1533. The total reached many thousands. Bishop 
Latimer, however, handed Henry instead of a purse a New 
Testament with a leaf doubled down at Hebrews xiii. 4, as 
apposite to the king's then impending marriage with Anne 
Boleyn. In Edward VI. 's time, if not earlier, it was usual for 
the sovereign to give " rewards " to those who presented New 
Year's gifts. Elizabeth is related to have been most conscientious 
in this regard. The custom of offering New Year's gifts to the 
sovereign became obsolete during the Commonwealth and was 
not revived at the Restoration. > 

NEW YORK, one of the original thirteen United States of 
America, situated between 40 29' 40" and 45° o' 2" N., and 
between 71 51' and 79 45' 54-4" W. Its northern boundary 
is, for the most part, formed by Lake Ontario and the St Law- 
rence river, which separate it from the province of Ontario, 
Canada; but north of the Adirondacks the boundary line leaves 
the St Lawrence, extending in a due east direction to the lower 
end of Lake Champlain. Thus the boundary between New York 
and the province of Quebec, Canada, is wholly artificial. 
Vermont, Massachusetts and Connecticut bound New York on 
the E.; the Atlantic Ocean, New Jersey and Pennsylvania, on 
the S.; and Pennsylvania, Lake Erie and the Niagara river on 
the W. 

The state has a triangular outline, with a breadth from E. 
to W. of 326-46 m. and from N. to S., on the line of the Hudson, 
of 300 m. In addition, it includes Long Island and Staten 
Island on the Atlantic Coast. Its land area is 47,654 sq. m. and 
the area of the inland waters is 1550 sq. m., giving a total area 
of 49,204 sq. m. In addition to this, New York includes 3140 
sq. m. of water in Lakes Ontario and Erie. 

Topography. — The most notable topographic feature is the roughly 
circular mountain area of north-eastern New York knownas the 
Adirondack mountains (q.v.). This is a very ancient mountain mass 
of crystalline rocks resembling more the Laurentian mountains of 
Canada than the Appalachians. Indeed, it is commonly considered 
to be an extension of the Canadian mountains. Parts of the crystal- 
line area are worn down to a condition of low relief, but in the main 
mountain mass, although greatly worn, there are still elevations of 
truly mountainous proportions. The highest peak is Mount Marcy 
(5344 ft.), though associated with it are several other peaks with an 
elevation from 4000 to 5000 ft. Even the higher summits are worn 
to a rounded condition, and are therefore for the most part forest 
covered up to the timber line which, on Mount Marcy, is at an 
elevation of about 4900 ft. From the crest of the dome of the 
Adirondacks proper the surface slopes in all directions to surround- 
ing lowlands: to the St Lawrence valley on the N.; the Champlain- 
Hudson lowland on the E.; the Mohawk valley on the S.; and Lake 
Ontario on the \W While igneous and metamorphic crystalline 
rocks form the bulk of the Adirondack area, it is surrounded by a ring 
of ancient Palaeozoic sediments in which these peripheral lowlands 
have been developed. The Adirondack area proper, and much of 
the surrounding ring of more recent rocks, is either too rugged, or 
has a soil too thin and rocky for extensive agriculture. It is there- 
fore a sparsely settled region with lumbering for one of the leading 
industries, though there is some mining, as of iron. Owing to the 
varied and beautiful scenery, this is a favourite summer resort; 
the game of the forests and the fishing in the streams and in the 
multitude of lakes serve as further attractions. In the peripheral 
ring farming increases, especially dairying; and manufacturing 
industries connected with the products of forests, farms and mines 
are developed. These and other manufacturing industries are greatly 
aided by the extensive water power furnished by the mountain 
streams which flow out radially from the central area. 

South of the Adirondack region, and S. of the Mohawk Valley, 
rises a high-level plateau which extends westward to the Pennsyl- 
vania boundary. Here the rocks are all essentially horizontal and of 
Palaeozoic age, mainly Devonian. This plateau province, which 
includes more than half the state, differs greatly from place to place. 
Its elevation decreases toward the N. by a series of steps, having its 
lowest elevation on the Ontario plain which skirts the southern shore 
of Lake Ontario. Similar to this is a narrow plain along the southern 
shore of Lake Eric, which, in fact, lies in a shallow depression in this 
Erie plain. Both of these plains are so level, and have so fertile a soil 
that they are the seats of extensive agriculture, especially fruit 
raising, which is further encouraged by the influence of the large 
bodies of lake water that moderate the heat of summer and the cold 
of winter, and tend to check the late frosts of spring and the early 
frosts of autumn. 

Elsewhere in the plateau province the land is higher and the surface 
far more irregular, increasing in ruggedness toward both the S. and 
the E. Elevations of between 1500 and 2000 ft. are common in this 
region all the way from Chautauqua county in the extreme W. to 
the Catskill mountains in the E.; and in places the surface becomes 
so rugged as to simulate the features of mountains and locally to 
win the name mountain. Valleys are deeply sunk in the plateau, 
the largest with bottom lands of sufficient width to give rise to strips 
of fertile farm land. The valley walls rise to undulating, and often 
fairly level uplands, which are, in large part, cleared of forest ; but 
the uplands are remote from markets, and the soil is thin. In the 
main they are grazing lands — the seat of important dairy and sheep- 
raising industries. This is the region of abandoned farm houses. 
Thousands have been deserted and they may be found along all the 
upland roads. 

Since this plateau region is a northward extension of the Alleghany 
plateau, which skirts the western base of the Appalachian mountains, 
it rises as the mountains are approached. Thus, in S.E. New York, 
where the Appalachians enter the state, the plateau becomes much 
higher than in the W., reaching its culmination in the Catskills. 
Here, partly because of elevation, and partly because of the resistant 
nature of the Catskill sandstones, dissection has so sculptured the 
plateau as to carve it into a mountainous mass which is generally 
known as the Catskill mountains. In this part of the plateau, 
summit elevations of from 3000 to 4000 ft. are common, the highest 
point being Slide Mountain (4205 ft.). Like the Adirondacks, this 
region is largely forest covered, and is a favourite summer resort; 
but it is far less a wilderness than the Adirondacks, and in places is 
cleared for farming, especially for pasturage. 

In the plateau province there are other areas known as mountains, 
of which the Helderberg mountains are the most conspicuous. This 
formation is really an escarpment facing the lower Mohawk and the 
Hudson river S. of Albany, where there is a downward step in the 
plateau. The steeply rising face of the plateau here is due to the resist- 
ance of a durable layer of limestone, known as the Helderberg lime- 
stone. There are other lower escarpments in the plateau province, 
similar in form and cause to the Helderberg escarpment. Of these the 
most notable is the Niagara escarpment which extends eastward from 
Canada, past Lewiston and Lockport, — a downward step from the 
Erie to the Ontario plain, where the Niagara limestone outcrops, and 
its resistance to denudation accounts for the steeply rising face at the 
boundary between the two plains. 

South and S.E. of the Catskills, although including only a small 
portion of the state, there are a number of different topographic 
features, due to the belts of different rock structure which cross the 
state from S.W. to N.E. First come the low folds of the western 
Appalachians, which, though well developed in Pennsylvania, die 
out near the New York boundary. The most pronounced of these 
upfolded strata in New York form the low Shawangunk mountains, 
which descend, toward the S.E., to a lowland region of folded strata 
of limestone, slate and other rocks in Orange and Dutchess counties. 
This lowland area, due to the non-resistant character of the strata, 
is a continuation of the Great Valley of the Appalachians, and ex- 
tends N.E. into Vermont and S.W. across New Jersey, Pennsylvania, 
Maryland and Virginia. It is bounded on its S.E. side by the 
Highlands, a belt of ancient crystalline rocks which extends N.E. 
into Connecticut and Massachusetts,* and S.W. into the Highlands 
of New Jersey and thence to the Blue Ridge. South of the High- 
lands, in New Jersey, but extending to the very banks of the Hudson, 
is a belt of Triassic sandstone with intrusions of trap rock, which, on 
account of its peculiar columnar jointing, has developed a palisade 
structure — the famous Palisades of the lower Hudson. On the New 
York side of the Hudson the rocks are crystalline, the surface a 
region of low hills, a continuation of the crystalline area of Con- 
necticut, and comparable with the Piedmont plateau of the Southern 
states. Long Island, though modified by extensive glacial deposits, 
may be considered a N.E. extension of the coastal plains which attain 
a much more perfect development in New Jersey and the states 
farther S. 

The entire surface of New York, with the exception of a very small 
area in the extreme W., in Chautauqua and Cattaraugus counties, 
was covered by the continental glacier. With its source in Canada, it 
overrode even the highest mountains and spread beyond the boundary 
of New York into Pennsylvania and New Jersey; but farther E. its 
front rested on Staten Island and Long Island, whose surface features, 
and a part of whose area, are due to the deposits along the ice front, 
including terminal moraines and outwash gravel plains. Elsewhere in 
the state, also, the work of the glacier is very evident. It broadened 
and deepened many of the valleys; rounded the hills; turned aside 
many streams, causing changes in drainage and giving rise to in- 
numerable waterfalls and rapids; and it formed the thousands of 
lakes, large and small, which dot the surface. As the ice receded, it 
halted at various points, forming moraines and other glacial 
deposits. Thus the soil of almost the entire state has been derived 
by glacial action. After the continental ice sheet entirely disap- 
peared from the state, local valley glaciers lingered in the Adirondacks 
and the Catskills. 

Drainage. — The drainage of New York finds its way to the sea in 
various directions. The St Lawrence system receives the most, 
mainly from short streams from the plateau province and from the 
Adirondacks. A small part of the state, in the W., drains to the 
Ohio, and thence, by way of the Mississippi, to the Gulf of Mexico; 
and a much larger area drains into the Susquehanna, entering the 
head of Chesapeake Bay. A part of the Catskills, and the region 
farther S., drains into Delaware Bav through the Delaware river. 
Thus New York is pre-eminently a divide region, sending its drainage, 
by various courses, into widely separated parts of the ocean. Only 
the Hudson and a few streams in the extreme S. have independent 
courses to the sea within the state itself. 

The Hudson (q.v.) is essentially a New York stream, though it 
receives some drainage from the New England States through its 
small eastern tributaries. Its entire course is within New York, from 
which it receives most of its water supply. It is by far the most 
important river in the state, for, owing to the sinking of the land, 
which has admitted the tide as far as Troy, it is navigable for 151 m. 
from the sea. Thence westward the^ Mohawk Valley furnishes a 
highway which is followed by canal, railway and waggon road. Thus 
there is here a gap, easily traversed, across the Appalachian mountains 
and plateaus to the more level and fertile plains beyond. A low 
gap also leads northward from the Hudson to the Champlain Valley 
across a pass only 147 ft. above sea-level. This was of much import- 
ance in early wars; but it is of only minor importance as a com- 
mercial highway since it leads to Canada through a region of little 
economic importance. 

The lower Hudson, below Troy, is really a fiord, the stream valley 
being drowned by the sea through subsidence of the land. It is noted, 
for its remarkable scenery, especially where it crosses the Highlands. 
The other large river valleys are far less useful as highways, though 
each is paralleled by one or more railways. The action of the 
continental glacier in scouring down the passes between the St 
Lawrence and southern drainage, and in turning streams southward, 
has facilitated the building of railways across the divides. 

There are thousands of lakes and ponds in the state, most of them 
very small and all, even including Lakes Erie and Ontario, the result 
of glacial action. The largest lake apart from Erie and Ontario is the 
beautiful Lake Champlain, which lies on the eastern boundary, 
partly in Vermont, and with the N. end in Canada. It occupies the 
lower portion of the trough between the Adirondacks and the Green 
Mountains. The largest lake entirely within the state is Lake George, 
famous for its beautiful scenery. In the central part of the state 
are a series of peculiar elongated lakes, extending in a nearly N.S. 
direction, known as the Finger Lakes. The largest of these are 
Cayuga, Seneca, Keuka, Canandaigua, Owasco and Skaneateles. In 
the extreme western part of the state is Chautauqua Lake, beautifully 
situated in the plateau of western New York. 

New York is noted for its many falls and rapids, some of them of 
great beauty. Of these the largest is the cataract of Niagara, about 
I m. wide and 160 ft. high. The American Fall is entirely within the 
state; but the Canadian boundary-line passes down the centre of the 
Horseshoe or Canadian Fall. Other notable falls are those of the 
Genesee at Portage and at Rochester, Trenton Falls, the Falls of 
Ticonderoga, and a multitude of falls and rapids in the Adirondack 
region and along the shores of the upper portions of the Finger Lakes. 
Here the tributary streards tumble down the sides of the lake valleys, 
whose bottoms have been deepened by glacial erosion, leaving the 
tributary valleys hanging. There are scores of picturesque glens 
here, and hundreds of waterfalls, among the most beautiful being in 
the Cayuga valley — notably Enfield Falls, a few miles S. of Ithaca, 
Ithaca Falls in the city, and Taughannock, a few miles N. of Ithaca. 
The last, the highest waterfall in the state, has a vertical fall of 
2 1 5 ft. Similar glens and falls are found in the Seneca Valley, the best 
known being the widely renowned Watkins Glen, now reserved as a 
state park (see Watkins). Many of the waterfalls of New York, 
but notably Niagara, are used as a source of power. 

The Coast-line. — New York has extensive coast-line along the 
Great Lakes, 75 m. on Lake Erie and over 200 m. on Lake Ontario. 
Where the lake waters flood the stream mouths, there are excellent 
harbours, and lake navigation is therefore of high importance. The 
largest of the lake ports is at Buffalo at the head of Niagara river, 
where, owing to the Niagara cataract, lake boats from the W. must 
transfer their goods torail or canal. Buffalo lies at the lower end 
of natural lake navigation, though by the building of a ship canal in 
Canada, lake steamers can proceed into Lake Ontario and thence to 
the St Lawrence. 

The ocean coast-line, though of limited extent, is by far the most 
important in the United States. The greater part of the sea coast is 
on Long Island — a low, sandy coast, the seat of numerous summer 
resorts and of some fishing. The mainland, opposite the western end 
of Long Island, is traversed by the lower Hudson and other channels 
— submerged valleys — which form a branching bay with several 
islands, the largest of which are Staten and Manhattan Islands. The 
western bank of the lower Hudson is in New Jersey. This branching 
bay makes an excellent protected harbour, with an immense water 
front, at the outlet of the chief natural highway from the E. to the 
interior of the country. Naturally, therefore, a dense population, 
engaged mainly in manufacturing and commerce, has gathered 
around the shores of this harbour, the greatest number on Manhattan 
Island and the contiguous mainland in New York City, but large 
numbers also on western Long Island, in Brooklyn, on the smaller 
islands, and on the New Jersey side. The harbour entrance is some- 
what obstructed by sand bars, so that extensive government work 
has been necessary to open and maintain a channel for large draft 
ocean vessels. This sand has not been brought by the Hudson itself, 
for that river drops most of its sediment load far up stream, in its long 
tidal channel. It is supplied by the tidal- and wind-formed currents, 
which are drifting sand from the Long Island and New Jersey 
coasts, extending the barrier beaches, such as Sandy Hook, out 
across the entrance to New York Bay. 

Climate. — In general the climate of New York is typical of that of 
northern United States, a climate of extremes, hot in summer, and 
cold in winter, and yet healthful, stimulating, and, on the whole, 
not disagreeable. In the absence of extensive alluvial plains and 
marshes, there is little malaria. The average mean annual tempera- 
ture is not far from 45 F., though it varies from over 50 ° near New 
York City, and 48 near the Lake Erie shore, to less than 40 in the 
high Adirondacks. The average maximum summer heat is about 
93 , temperature of 100 being rarely reached. In the winter the 
temperature descends below zero during exceptionally cold spells. 
A temperature of -20 or lower is never attained in the southern 
portion, seldom in the central, but is often passed, by 5 or 10 degrees, 
in the Adirondacks and in the higher parts of the plateau. The 
rivers and smaller lakes freeze in winter and navigation on the St 
Lawrence river is closed by ice on the average from about the middle 
of December until early in April. The average rainfall is between 40 
and 45 in., but it is less than 30 in. in the Lake Champlain Valley and 
over 55 in. N. of New York City. In most of the state frosts begin 
from September 1st to October 1st, and end from April 1st to May 
1st. In the Adirondack region the snowfall is heavy, the winter long 
and severe. In central New York it is not uncommon for snow to 
accumulate to the depth of 3 or 4 ft., and yet this is not persistent. 
About New York City, and on Long Island, the snow rarely exceeds 
1 ft. in depth. The climate is very variable, owing to the frequent 
passage of cyclonic storms from the W. and S.W., bringing warmer 
weather with rain and snow in winter, and causing days of great 
heat and humidity, with thunderstorms, in summer. Between these 
cyclonic storms come areas of high pressure, or anticyclones, with 
dry cool air in summer, and dry cold air in winter, sometimes with 
such decided changes in temperature as to merit the name cold wave. 
About New York City, and on Long Island, the ocean softens the 
rigours of winter, and through the influence of cold surface waters 
off the coast, tempers the heat of summer. The temperature of the 
larger valleys is notably higher than that of the uplands; and the 
temperature along the lake shores is decidedly influenced by the 
large bodies of water. Lakes Ontario and Erie never freeze com- 
pletely over in winter. 

Although one of the smaller states In the Union, being 30th in 
area, New York ranks first in population and In wealth, and has 
won for itself the name Empire State. The physiography 
has enabled the state to become a great highway of commerce 
between the central part of the United States and the sea-coast, 
by rail and by water, along the Mohawk Gap and by other routes. 
The Great Lakes waterway naturally finds an outlet in New York 
City. This has made it easy for the states to the west to con- 
tribute raw materials, notably coal and iron, adding these to the 
natural raw products of New York. Thus it happens that 
from Buffalo to New York City there is a chain of busy manu- 
facturing centres along the natural highway followed by the 
Erie Canal and the Hudson river. Other parts of the state, 
where connected with the main highway, are influenced by it 
to some extent; but away from the great natural route of 
commerce New York is not especially noteworthy either for its 
density of population or for extensive manufacturing and 
commerce. (R. S. T.) 

Flora. — When first settled by Europeans New York was a wood- 
land region containing nearly all the varieties of trees, shrubs and 
plants which were common to the territory lying E. of the Mississippi 
river, N. of the Ohio, and S. of the St Lawrence. In the Adirondack 
region the trees were principally white pine, spruce, hemlock and 
balsam, but mixed with these were some birch, maple, beech and 
basswood, and smaller numbers of ash and elm; in the swamps of this 
region were also larch. and cedar. The forests of the W. half of the 
state contained pine, but here such hardwood trees as oak, chestnut, 
hickory, maple and beech were more common. The tulip tree was 
common both in the S.W. and N.; and the walnut, butternut, 
poplar, sycamore and locust were widely distributed. The original 
varieties of trees still abound, though in less numbers, on lands ill- 
adapted to agriculture, and in the Adirondack and Catskill Mountains, 
where the state has established forest preserves, and the Forest, 
Fish and Game Commissioner began reforesting in 1901, principally 
with pine, spruce and larch. On the summits of the Adirondacks are 
a few alpine species, such as reindeer moss and other lichens; on the 
shores of Longlsland, Staten Island and Westchester county are a 
number of maritime species; and on Long Island are several species 
especially characteristic of the pine barrens of New Jersey. Laurel, 
rhododendron, and whortleberry are common shrubs in the mountain 
districts, and sumac, hazel, sassafras and elder are quite widely 
distributed elsewhere. Among indigenous fruit-bearing plants ths 
state has the black cherry, red cherry, red plum, yellow plum, grape, 
black currant, blackberry, dewberry, strawberry and cranberry. 
Blue flag, snake root, ginseng, lobelia, tansy, wormwood, winter- 
green, pleurisy root, plantain, burdock, sarsaparilla and horehound 
are among its medicinal plants. Cowslips, violets, anemones, 
buttercups and blood-roots are conspicuous in early spring, the 
white pond lily and the yellow pond lily in summer, asters and 
golden-rod in autumn, ancl besides these there are about 1500 other 
flowering plants in the state and more than <>o species of ferns. 

Fauna. — Of the fur and game animals which were inhabitants of 
the primeval forests few of the larger species remain except in the 
Adirondack region. Here the puma ('* panther ") has become 
extinct and the Canada lynx is rare. The moose, the elk and the 
beaver have been placed under £he protection of the Forest, Fish 
and Game Commissioner. There are many deer in the Adirondacks. 
The porcupine is common, but the Canada pine marten or American 
sable, fisher, and red fox are rare, and the black bear and grey wolf 
are found only in small numbers. Rabbits .and squirrels are 
numerous in nearly all parts of the state; skunks, weasels, 
muskrats and woodchucks are common; there are some racoons; 
mink are frequently taken in the Adirondacks; and a few otter 
remain. In the lower counties are some " Virginia " opossums. t 

Among birds of prey a bald eagle and a golden eagle are occasion- 
ally seen in secluded places. Game birds include ducks, geese, 
plovers, snipe, loons, grebes, terns, rails, the woodcock and the ruffed 
grouse; cjuails are scarce except on Long Island, where a number of 
young birds are liberated each year, and by the same means a supply

of pheasants is maintained in some parts of the state. There is a 
state game bird farm (1909) near Sherburne in Chenango county. 
Herons, the brown pelican, bittern, and mud hen frequent the 
marshes. The robin, song sparrow, chickadee, thrushes, warblers, 
vireos, orioles, wrens, blue-bird, cat-bird and phoebe are favourite 
song birds. 

There are about 375 species of fish in New York waters (see below 
under Fisheries). 

Soil. — The soil is mostly glacial drift, but its depth and composi- 
tion often vary greatly even within small areas. The most widely 
distributed soil, especially in the W. half of the state, is mainly a clay 
which was formed by the glacial pulverizing of limestone and shale 
and is still forming from the decomposition of fragments of these 
substances. In the larger valleys and along the shores of lakes 
considerable alluvium is mixed with this clay. In the E. there is 
some clay formed mainly^ by the decomposition of slate. A sandy 
loam is quite characteristic of some of the N. counties, and gravelly 
loams containing limestone are not uncommon. 

Agriculture ami Stock-Raising. — Although New York has lost in the 
competition with the Western States in the production of^most of the 
grains, especially wheat and barley, and in the production of wool, 
mutton and pork, it has made steady progress in the dairy business 
and continues to produce great crops of hay. The state has made 
great advances, too, in the production of flowers, ornamental plants, 
nursery products, fruits, vegetables, poultry and eggs. In 1900 a 
little less than three-fourths of the state's total land area was in- 
cluded in farms and a little more than two-thirds of this was im- 
proved. The number of farms gradually increased from 170,621 in 
1850 to 226,720 in 1900, and the average size decreased from 112*1 
acres in 18501097-1 acres in 1890, but increased to 99*9 acres in 1900. 
More than two-thirds of the farms (152,956) were operated by owners 
or part owners, 29/000 were operated by share tenants, and 24,303 
by cash tenants. Of the total acreage of all crops, 5,154,965 acres 
(54*i %) were of hay and 3,125,077 acres (32-8%) were of cereals. 
In 1 909 the amount of the hay crop (5,002,000 tons) was greater than 
that of any other state except Iowa, and its value (§71,028,000) was 
greater than in any other state. The oat crop in 1909 was 37,365,000 
bushels; the Indian corn crop, 1,910,000 bushels; the wheat crop, 
24,120,000 bushels; the barley crop, 8,820,000 bushels; the rye crop, 
2,720,000 bushels; buckwheat, 7,512,000 bushels. 

There were less Jhan one-third as many sheep in 1910 (1,177,000) 
as in 1850; but in the same period the number of dairy cows 
(1,771,000 in 1910) steadily increased. The number of cattle other 
than dairy cows was 946,315 in 1850 and 889,000 in 1910. Horses 
increased from 447,014 in 1850 to 717,000 in 1910. 

New York has a larger acreage of vegetables than any other state. 
Its crop of potatoes in 1909 was 52,560,000 bushels and that of 
Maine, the next largest, 29,250,000 bushels; and the state is a large 
producer of onions, turnips, cabbages, cauliflower, sweet Indian 
corn, cucumbers, rhubarb, parsnips, carrots, green peas and green 
beans. During the years 1850-1889 New York produced about 70 % 
of the hop crop of the entire country, but since 1890 hop culture has 
been rapidly extended in the Pacific Coast states and suffered to de- 
cline in New York, and the crop from 1899 to 1907 averaged only 
about one-half that of 1889 (20,063,029 lb). Tobacco culture was 
introduced in 1845, and in i860 the crop was 5,764,582 lb. During 
1 860-1 880 the increase was slight, but in 1899 the crop was 
13,958,370 lb; in 1909 the crop was only 7,050,000 ft). The value of 
the fruit crop in 1899 ($15,844,346) was second only to that of 
California; and the most productive agricultural lands are those 
devoted to floriculture and nurseries. 

The dairy business and the production of hay are especially 
prominent in the rugged region W. of the Adirondack Mountains and 
in the rugged portions of the counties in the S. half of the state. A 
large portion of the Indian corn, wheat and barley is produced on the 
Ontario plain. There are large crops of oats here, too, but the culture 
of this cereal is quite extensive in most of the counties W. of the 
Adirondacks. The lower valley of the Hudson is noted for its crops 
of rye. The buckwheat belt extends S.W. across the state from 
Albany and Saratoga counties. The principal hop-producing counties 
are Otsego, Schoharie and Madison, all of which are between Albany 
and Syracuse. Those producing most tobacco are in a district ex- 
tending from the S.E. shore of Lake Ontario southward across the 
state. The great orchards are in the tier of counties bordering the S. 
shore of Lake Ontario and in Dutchess and Ulster counties in the 
Hudson Valley. Chautauqua county alone produced more than 
one-half of the state's crop of grapes in 1899, but this fruit is ^rown 
extensively also in the region W. of Seneca Lake in the vicinity of 
Lake Keuka, and in parts of the lower valley of the Hudson. The 
culture of small fruits and vegetables is widely distributed throughout 
the W. half of the state and in the valley of the Hudson, and the 
greater part of Long Island under cultivation is devoted to market 
gardening, floriculture and nurseries. The largest nurseries, however, 
are in the vicinity of Rochester. 

Forest Products. — The principal forest area is in the Adirondack 
region where the state has a forest preserve (in Clinton, Essex, 
Franklin, Fulton, Hamilton, Herkimer, Lewis, Oneida, t St Law- 
rence, Saratoga, Warren and Washington counties) containing (1909) 
I »53°t559 acres, and there is as much or more in private pre- 
serves and in tracts owned by lumbermen. The state has a forest 
preserve also in the Catskill region (in Delaware, Greene, Sullivan 
and Ulster counties) of 110,964 acres, and there are wood-lots on 
many farms throughout the state that produce commercial timber. 
Originally white pine was the principal timber of the Adirondacks, 
but most of the merchantable portion has been cut, and in 1905 
nearly one-half of the lumber product of this section was spruce, the 
other half mainly hemlock, pine and hardwoods (yellow birch, maple, 
beech and t>asswood,and smaller amounts of elm, cherry and ash). 
The state is reforesting portions of its preserve chiefly with pine, 
spruce and larch. In the Catskills and in the farming regions the 
lumber product consists largely of hardwoods (mostly oak, chestnut 
and hickory), smaller amounts of hemlock and pine, and a very little 
spruce. The state's entire timber product in 1905 was 1,212,070,168 
ft. (board measure) ; of this about five-eighths was from the Adiron- 
dack region, a little more than one-fourth was from the farming 
regions, and a little less than one-eighth was from the Catskill region. 
Maple sugar is an important by-product of the forests, and in the 
production of this commodity New York ranks second only to 
Vermont ; 3,623,540 lb were made in 1900. 

Fisheries. — New York was in 1904 more extensively engaged in 
oyster culture than any other state, and was making more rapid 
progress in the cultivation of hard clams. In 1909 there were 
distributed from state fish hatcheries 1 531,293,721 fishes (mostly 
smelt, pike-perch, and winter flatfish); a large number of fish 
and eggs were also placed in New York waters by the United States 
Bureau of Fisheries. The products of the marine fisheries decreased 
nearly 30 % in value from 1891 to 1897, but from 1897 to 1904 they 
increased from S3»39 I »595 to $6,230,558, or 80-3 %, and a large part 
of this increase was due to the extension of the successful oyster 
culture at the E. end of Long Island; the value of oysters alone 
rising from $2,050,058 to $3,780,352. The value of hard clams rose 
during the same period from $198,930 to $303,599. Peconic Bay, 
at the E. end of Long Island, yields more scallops than all the other 
waters of the United States. Soft clams, lobsters, hard crabs and 
soft crabs are other shell-fish obtained in small quantities. Menhaden 
are caught in much larger quantities in New York than any other 
fish, but being too bony for food they are used only in the manu- 
facture of oil and fertilizer. The most valuable catches of food fish 
in 1904 were those of bluefish ($556,527), squeteague ($212,623), 
flounders ($67,159), eels ($53,832), cod ($52,710), scup ($48,068) 
and shad ($36,826). The shad fishery is mainly in the lower waters 
of the Hudson river, and the catch diminished so rapidly from 1901 
that in 1904 it was only about one-eighth of the average for the 
decade from 1890 to 1900. The New York fisheries of Lakes Erie 
and Ontario and the Niagara and St Lawrence rivers yielded pro- 
ducts in 1903 valued at $187,798 and consisting largely of pike- 
perch, herring, catfish, bullheads and sturgeon, and in 1902 there were 
commercial fisheries in sixteen interior lakes and rivers which yielded 
muscallonge, smelt, bullheads, pickerel, pike-perch and several other 
varieties having a total value of $87,897. 

Minerals. — More than thirty mineral substances are obtained in 
commercial quantities from the mines, quarries and wells of New 
York, but of the total value of the mineral products in 1908 
($45,660,861), nearly six-sevenths was represented by clay products 
($8,929,224), pig iron ($15,879,000), stone ($6,157,279), cement 
($2,254,759), salt ($2,136,738), petroleum ($2,07 1,533), and sand and 
gravel ($1,349,163). The extensive deposits of clay in the Hudson 
Valley together with the easy water communications with New 
York City have-made this valley the greatest brick-making region in 
the world; in 1906 the common bricks made here numbered 
1,230,692,000. There are also deposits of clay suitable for making 
bricks, terra-cotta and tiles in nearly every county outside of this 
valley, and there are some pottery clays in Albany and Onondaga 
counties. The common bncks made in New York in 1908 were 
valued at $5,066,084, an amount in excess of that in any other 
state; and the total value of brick and tile products was $7,270,981, 
being less than that of Ohio, Pennsylvania or Illinois. In 1750 the 
mining of iron ore was begun near Monroe, Orange county. Ore 
has since been found in most of the eastern counties and as far W. 
as Wayne county, but the mines in Essex, Clinton and Franklin 
counties of the Adirondack region are by far the most productive. 
The ores are principally magnetites (New York is the largest producer 
of magnetite ore among the states, producing about 45 % of the total 
for the United States in 1907 and 1908), but red haematites occur in 
the N. and W. section of the Adirondacks and in the central part of 
the state, and brown haematites and carbonate ore in the S.E. 
counties. The total output of the state increased from 651,228 long 
tons in 1884 to 1,253,593 long tons in 1890, decreased to 179,951 
long tons in 1898, again increased to 1,375,020 long tons in 1907, 
when only three states produced more, and was only 697,473 long 
tons in 1908 when the state held the same rank as in 1907. Limestone 

	1 These include: the Adirondack Hatchery at Upper Saranac, 
	Franklin county; the Caledonia Hatchery at Mumford, Monroe 
	county; the Cold Spring Harbor Hatchery, at Cold Spring Harbor, 
	Suffolk county; the Delaware Hatchery, at Margaretville, Delaware 
	county; the Fulton Chain Hatchery, at Old Forge, Herkimer 
	county; the Linlithgo Hatchery, at Linlithgo, Columbia county; 
	the Oneida Hatchery, at Constantia, Oswego county; and the 
	Pleasant Valley Hatchery, at Taggart, Steuben county. 

is widely distributed throughout the state, and great quantities of it 
are crushed for road-making, railway ballasts, and concrete, but as 
the prevailing colours are greyish or drab it is little used in the walls 
of buildings. In 1908 the total value of the output of this stone was 
$2,584,550. Three distinct varieties of sandstone are quarried 
extensively. Those popularly known as " bluestones " belong to 
the Hamilton period of the Devonian formation and occur mainly 
between the Hudson and Delaware rivers. They are dark blue-grey, 
fine grained and durable, and are much used for flagging and kerbing 
and for sills, caps and steps. Medina sandstones occur throughout a 
belt averaging about 10 m. wide along the S. shore of Lake Ontario 
and are either red or grey ; the red are used for building, the grey Jor 
street paving. A more durable and more beautiful stone for building 
is the reddish or reddish-brown Potsdam sandstone of which there 
are extensive formations on the N.W. border of the Adirondacks. 
The value of all sandstones quarried in 1908 was $1,774,843, an 
amount exceeded by no other state. Several choice marbles are 
obtained in the eastern counties. From Tuckahoe, Westchester 
county, has been taken white marble, used in some of the finest 
buildings in New York City, and a similar marble is obtained in 
Putnam and Dutchess counties. Near Gouverneur, St Lawrence 
county, is a large quarry of coarsely crystalline magnesian limestone, 
used as monumental marble. In the Lower Silurian formation at 
Plattsburg and Chazy, in Clinton county, are two beautiful grey or 
grey and pink marbles, one of which is a favourite among domestic 
marbles tor mantels, table tops and other interior decorations. 
From an extensive deposit of blue-black magnesian limestone at 
Glens Falls are taken the choicest varieties of black marble quarried 
in the United States. At Moriah and Port Henry, in Essex county, 
is a stone known as ophlite marble, a mixture of serpentine, dolomite 
and calcite interspersed with small flecks of phlogopite. Larger 
deposits of serpentine occur at several places in St Lawrence county; 
and at Warwick, in Orange county, is some beautiful marble of a 
carmine-red colour occasionally mottled with white or showing white 
veins. *The marble quarried in 1908 was valued at $706,858. There 
are extensive formations of granitic rocks in the Adirondacks, in the 
lower Hudson Valley, and in the adjacent highlands, but they are not 
extensively quarried. Rockland county quarries considerable trap 
rock, used mostly for road-making and concrete, and Ulster county 
has for more than a century produced most of the domestic mill- 
stones used in the United States. Extending from Madison county 
to the W. border of the state in Eriecounty is a narrow belt con- 
taining large deposits of gypsum, and in 1008 the value of the state's 
output ($760,759) was greater than that 01 any other state, although 
Michigan produced a larger quantity. At or near Chittenango, in 
Madison county, natural-cement rock was first discovered in the 
United States, and the first use made of it was in the construction of 
the Erie Canal. The rock was found in much greater quantities at 
Rosendale, in Ulster county, in 1823, and the amount of this cement 
produced by New York rose to 4,689,167 barrels in 1899; the state 
is still the chief producer but only 947,920, barrels were made in 
1908. Limestone and clay suitable for making Portland cement are 
also found in Ulster county and elsewhere, and the production of 
this increased from 65,000 barrels in 1890 to 2,290,955 barrels in 
1908. Near Talcville, in St Lawrence county, is a large deposit of 
fibrous talc. In 1908 the total value of the state's talc product was 
$697,390, almost one-half the total for the entire country. 

New York and Michigan are the two principal pit-producing 
states in the Union. Salt was discovered by the Jesuits in Western 
New York about the middle of the 17th century, and was manu- 
factured by the Indians in the Onondaga region. The state bought 
the salt reservation in 1788, and soon afterward the manufacture of 
salt was begun by the whites. From 1880 to 1885 the first brines 
were obtained in Wyoming and Genesee counties by boring deep wells 
into beds of rock salt^and in 1885 the mining of the extensive de- 
posits of rock salt in Livingston county was begun. Salt is also pro- 
duced in Tompkins and Schuyler counties. In 1908 the total pro- 
duction of the state, 9,076,743 barrels valuedat $2,136,738, was 
exceeded in quantity and (for the first time) in value by that of 
Michigan. 

The Appalachian oil field extends northward from West Virginia 
and Pennsylvania into Cattaraugus, Allegany and Steuben counties. 
The first oil well in the state was drilled at Limestone in Cattaraugus 
county in 1865, and the state's output of oil was 1,160,128 barrels, 
valued at $2,071 ,533 in 1908. At Olean it is pumped into pipes which 
extend as far north as Buffalo and as far east as Long Island City. 
The village of Fredonia, in Chautauqua county, was illuminated by 
natural gas as early as 1825, and gas has since been discovered in 
several of the western counties. The value of the flow in 1908 was 
$959.28o. 

There are more than forty mineral springs in New York whose 
waters are of commercial importance, and in 1908 the waters sold 
from them amounted to 8,007,092 gals., valued at $877,648; several 
of the springs, especially those in Saratoga county, attract a large 
number of summer visitors. Graphite is widely distributed in the 
Adirondack region, but the mining of it is confined for the most part 
to Essex and Warren counties; in 1908 the output was 1,932,000 lh. 
valued at $116,100. Other mineral substances obtained in small 
quantities are: pyrite, in St Lawrence county; arsenical ore, in 
Putnam county; red, green and purple slate, in Washington county; 
garnet in Warren, Essex and St Lawrence counties; emery and 
felspar, in Westchester county; and infusorial earth in Herkimer 
county. 

Manufactures. — The establishment of a great highway of commerce 
through the state from New York City to Buffalo by the construction 
of the Erie Canal, opened in 1825, and later by the building of rail- 
ways along the'line of the water route, made the state's manufactures 
quite independent of its own natural resources. The factory manu-. 
facture of clothing was begun in New York City about 1835, and 
received a great impetus from the invention of the sewing-machine, 
the demands created by the Civil War, and the immigration of vast 
numbers of foreign labourers. It is now the leading manufacturing 
industry of the state. The value of the clothing was $340,715,921 in 
1905. New York City ranks first pjnong American cities in pnnting 
and publishing, the products being valued at $137,985,751 in 1905. 
Knitting by machinery was introduced into America in 1831 at 
Cohoes Falls, on the Mohawk river; the products, consisting largely 
of underwear^ were valued at $46,108,600 in 1905. Of the other 
textile industries none except the manufacture of carpets and rugs and 
silk and silk goods has become very prominent, and yet the total 
value of all textile products in 1005 was $123,668,177. The refining 
of sugar was begun in New York City late in the 18th century, but 
the growth of the industry to its present magnitude has been com- 
paratively recent; the value of the sugar and molasses refined in 
1905 was $116,438,838. Foundry and machine-shop products were 
valued at $115,876,193 in 1905, and electrical machinery, apparatus, 
and supplies at $35,348,276. The manufacture of paper and wood-pulp 
products ($37,750,605 in 1905) is an industry for which the state still 
furnishes much of the raw material, and other large industries of 
which the same is true are the manufacture of flour and grist-mill 
products, dairy products, canned fruits and vegetables, wines, clay 
products, and salt. New York state has ranked first in the Union in 
the value of its manufactures since 1830, and their value rose to 
$2,488,345,579 in 1905. More than three-fifths of that of 1905 was 
represented by the manufactures of New York City alone. Buffalo, 
the second city in manufactures, shares largely with New York City 
the business of slaughtering and meat packing, the refining and 
smelting of copper, and the manufacture of foundry and machine- 
shop products, and with New York City and Rochester the manu- 
facture of flour and grist-mill products. Rochester ranks first 
among the cities of the United States in the manufacture of photo- 
graphic materials and apparatus and optical instruments. Niagara 
Falls and New York City manufacture a large part of the chemicals, 
and the value of the state's output rose to $29,090,484 in^ 1905. 
Gloversville and Johnstown are noted for leather gloves and mittens. 

Transportation and Commerce. — From the very beginning of the 
occupation of New York by Europeans, commerce was much 
encouraged by the natural water-courses. The Western Inland 
Lock Navigation Company, chartered by the state in 1792, com- 
pleted three canals within about four years and thereby permitted the 
continuous passage from Schenectady to Lake Ontario of boats of 
about 17 tons. The Erie Canal was begun by the state in 1817 and 
opened to boats of about 75 tons burden in 1825. The Champlain 
Canal, connecting the Erie with Lake Champlain, was also begun in 
1 81 7 and completed in 1823. The Oswego Canal, connecting the 
Erie with Lake Ontario, was begun in 1825 and completed in 1828. 
Several other tributary canals were constructed during this period, 
and between 1836 and 1862 the Erie was sufficiently enlarged to 
accommodate boats of 240 tons burden. 

The first railway in the state and the second in operation in the 
United States was the Mohawk & Hudson, opened from Albany to 
Schenectady in 1831. The railway mileage in the state increased to 
1 361 m. in 1850, to 3928 m. in 1870, to 7684*41 m. in 1890, and to 
8422-14 m. in January 1009. The first great trunk line in the country 
was that of the Erie railway, opened from Piermont, on the Hudson 
river, to Dunkirk, on Lake Erie, in 1853. The New York Central & 
Hudson River railway, nearly parallel with the water route from 
New York City to Buffalo, was formed by the union, in 1869, of the 
New York Central with the Hudson River railway. The West Shore 
railway, which follows closely the route of the New York Central & 
Hudson River, was also the result of a consolidation, completed in 
1881, of several shorter lines. In 1886 the New York Central & 
Hudson River Railroad Company leased the West Shore for a term 
of 475 years, and this company operates another parallel line from 
Syracuse to Buffalo, a line following closely the entire N. border of 
the state (the Rome, Watertown & Ogdcnsburg), and several cross 
lines. Other important railways are the Lehigh Valley, the Delaware, 
Lackawanna & Western, and the Pennsylvania in the central and 
W. sections, the Delaware & Hudson, the Rutland, and the New 
York Ontario & Western in the E., and the Long Island on Long 
Island. In competition with the railways, traffic on the existing 
canals suffered a marked decline. As, however, this decline was 
accompanied with a considerable decrease in the proportion of the 
country's exports which passed through the port of New York, 
interest in the canals revived, and in 1903 the electorate of the state 
authorized the issue of bonds to the amount of $101,000,000 for the 
purpose of increasing the capacity of the Erie, the Champlain and 
the Oswego canals, to make each navigable by barges of 1000 tons 
burden. A project adopted by the state for the enlargement of the 
Erie provides for a new route up the Hudson from Troy to Waterford 
and thence to the Mohawk river above Cohoes Falls. Up the Mohawk 
to Rome the old route is for the most part to be retained; but from 
Rome to Clyde there is to be a diversion so as to utilize Oneida Lake 
and Oneida and Seneca rivers. Westward from Clyde the new 
channel, like the old but larger, will pass through Rochester and 
Lockport to the Niagara river at Tonawanda. Each of the three 
canals is to have a minimum depth of 12 ft., a minimum bottom 
width in rivers and lakes of 200 ft., and in other sections a bottom 
width generally of 75 ft. Their locks are to be 328 ft. in length and 
45 ft. in width. 

The imports to the port of New York increased in value from 
$466,527,631 in 1897 to $891,614,678 in 1909, while the exports 
increased in value from $404,750496 to $627,782,767. Other ports 
of entry are Buffalo and Dunkirk, on Lake Erie, Niagara Falls, on 
the Niagara river, Ogdensburg and Cape Vincent, on the St 
Lawrence river, Plattsburg, on Lake Champlain, Oswego, on Lake 
Ontario, Rochester, on the Genesee river, Albany and Syracuse in 
the interior, and Sag Harbor at the E. end of Long Island. 

Population. — New York outstripped Pennsylvania in popula- 
tion in the first decade of the 19th century, and Virginia in the 
second decade, and since 1820 it has been the most populous 
state in the Union. In 1880 1 the population was 5,082,871; 
in 1890, 5,997,853; in 1900, 7,268,894; in 1905, according to 
the state census, 8,067,308; and in 1910, 9,113,614. The 
foreign-born population in 1900 was 1,900,425, including 
480,026 natives of Germany, 425,553 of Ireland, 182,248 of 
Italy, 165,610 of Russia, 135,685 of England, 117,535 °f Canada, 
78,491 of Austria, 69,755 of Poland and 64,055 of Scandinavia. 
More than two-thirds of the foreign-born were in New York City. 
The coloured population constituted only 1-5% of the total, 
and was composed of 99,232 negroes, 7170 Chinese, 5257 Indians 
and 354 Japanese. 

Most of the Indians were on eight reservations: the Allegany 
Reservation (30469 acres) in Cattaraugus county; the Cattaraugus 
Reservation (21,680 acres) in Eric, Cattaraugus and Chautauqua 
counties; the St Regis Reservation (14,030 acres) in Franklin 
county ; the Tonawanda Reservation (7548 acres) in Erie and Genesee 
counties; the Onondaga Reservation (7300 acres) in Onondaga county ; 
the Tuscarora Reservation (624 acres) in Niagara county ; the Oneida 
Reservation (400 acres) in Madison county; and the Shinnecock 
Reservation (400 acres) near Southampton, on Long Island. 

Of 3,591,974 members of all religious denominations in 1906, 
2,285,768 were Roman Catholics, 313,689 Methodist Episco- 
palians, 199,923 Presbyterians, 193,890 Protestant Episcopalians, 
176,981 Baptists, 124,644 Lutherans, 57,351 Congregationalists, 
35,342 Jews (heads of families only), 26,183 members of the 
German Evangelical Synod, 19,302 members of Eastern Orthodox 
churches and 10,761 Universalists. The urban population (i.e. 
population of places having 4000 inhabitants or more) increased 
from 3,805,477 in 1890 to 5,176,414 in 1900, or 36%, while the 
rural population (i.e. population outside of incorporated places) 
decreased during this decade from 1,834,119 to 1,625,859 or 5-9%. 

The cities having a population of 15,000 or more in 1905 were: 
New York City, 4,013,781; Buffalo, 376,587; Rochester, 181,666; 
Syracuse, 117,503; Albany, 98,374; Troy, 76,910; Utica, 62,934; 
Vonkers, 61,716; Schenectady, 58,387; Binghamton, 42,036; 
Elmira, 34,687; Auburn, 31,422; Niagara Falls, 26,560; Newburgh, 
26,498; Jamestown, " 26,160; Kingston, 25,556; Watertown, 
25,447; Poughkeepsie, 25,379; Mt. Vernon, 25,996; Cohoes, 
24,183; Amsterdam, 23,943; Oswego, 22,572; New Rochelle, 
20,479; Gloversville, 18,672; Lockport, 17,552; Rome, 16,562; 
and Dunkirk, 15,250. 

Government. — Since becoming a state, New York has been 
governed under four constitutions, adopted in 1777, 1821, 1846 
and 1894 respectively. The first state constitution, adopted by a 
convention at Kingston, made few changes in the provincial 
system other than those necessary to establish it on a popular 
basis, but the powers of the governor were curtailed, especially 
his powers of appointment and veto. These limitations worked 
unsatisfactorily, and their removal or modification and the 
extension of the "franchise were the principal changes effected in 
182 1. Under the first constitution the decentralization of 
administration, which began early in the colonial era, continued 
without interruption, and under the second it was checked by a 
few measures only. The third constitution, besides reorganizing 

	1 The population at preceding census years was: (1790) 340,120; 
	(1800) 589.051; (1810) 959»°49; (1820) 1,372,812; (1830) 
	1,918,608; (1840) 2,428.921; (1850) 3.097.394; (i860) 3,880,735; 
	(1870) 4,382,759. 

the judiciary, transferred to the people the choice of many 
officers, state and local, who had been appointed by the governor 
or the legislature; and placed numerous restrictions on the 
law-making power of the legislature. Under this constitution 
the theory of local self-government was more fully realized 
in New York than at any other time. 

Since the middle of the 19th century an attempt has been made 
to meet the problems arising from a rapid industrial and social 
development by creating bureaus or commissions to exercise a 
central control over local officials, corporations and even private 
individuals, and as most of the heads of these bureaus and the 
commissions are appointed by the governor the importance of 
that officer has increased. The constitutional changes since 
1846 affect principally the judiciary and cities. A constitutional 
convention met and proposed a new constitution in 1867, but 
every article was rejected by the people save one relating to the 
judiciary, which was adopted separately as an amendment in 
1869. The constitution of 1894 made further important changes 
in the judiciary and in the government of cities. The first 
constitution made no provision for its amendment or revision. 
The second provided that whenever a majority of the members 
elected to each house of the legislature voted for an amendment 
and two-thirds of those elected to the next legislature approved, 
it should be submitted to the people for their adoption or re- 
jection. The third modified this provision by requiring the 
approval of only a majority of the members elected to each 
house of the second legislature, and directed that the legislature 
should call a convention to revise the constitution at least once 
in twenty years if the people requested it. The present con- 
stitution contains the same clause as the thiid for the proposal 
of amendments by the legislature, and makes the unique pro- 
vision that if the people vote for a convention when the question 
is submitted to them — this must be as often as once in twenty 
years — the delegates shall be elected and shall assemble at an 
appointed time and place without the call of the legislature, 
this being the result of the governor's veto, in 1887, of a bill for 
calling a convention in response to an overwhelming vote of the 
people in favour of it. Under the first constitution there were 
property qualifications for voting which amounted in the election 
of the governor and senators to a freehold estate worth £100 
($500) and in the election of assemblymen to a freehold estate 
worth £20. ($100) or the payment of an annual rent of 40s. ($10). 
But under the second constitution the most that was required 
of any white voter was the payment to the state or county of 
taxes on either personal or real property, and by an amendment 
of 1826 this requirement was abolished. The second con- 
stitution, however, imposed a property qualification on coloured 
voters amounting to a freehold estate worth $250, and this re- 
striction was not removed until 1874. Since 1874 the aim has 
been to bestow suffrage on all male citizens who shall have 
attained the age of twenty-one years and shall have been in- 
habitants of the state for one year, but for the protection of the 
ballot citizenship for ninety days, 2 residence in the county for 
four months, and in the election district for thirty days next 
preceding the election are required. Conviction for bribery or 
of an infamous crime disqualifies, and personal identification 
of voters is required in New York City. A statement of 
receipts and expenditures of an election campaign, showing 
the amount received from each contributor and the name of 
every person or committee to whom more than $5 was paid, 
must be filed by the treasurer of every political committee within 
twenty days after the election; each candidate also must file a 
statement of his contributions. By an Act of 1910 women 
may vote on financial questions affecting a village in which 
they hold property. 

Executive. — When the state government was first established, 
the governor and lieutenant-governor were the only state officers 
elected by the people. The state treasurer was chosen by the 
legislature, and for the appointment of other state officers as 
well as county officers and mayors of cities the Assembly chose 
four senators to constitute a council of appointment, a body 

	8 Increased from ten days in 1894. 

in which the governor had only a casting vote. But the con- 
stitution of 1821 abolished the council of appointment and 
gave the choice of the principal state departmental officers to 
the legislature, and the constitution of 1846 transferred the 
choice of these officers from the legislature to the people, where 
it has since remained. Under the constitution of 1821 a great 
number of local officers were appointed by the governor with 
the advice and consent of the Senate. The choice of most of 
these was given to the people in 1846, but since then many new 
state departments have been created, the heads of which are 
usually appointed by the governor, subject to the approval of 
the Senate. Under the present system, therefore, there is a 
biennial election (in even-numbered years) of a governor, a 
lieutenant-governor, a secretary of state, a state comptroller, 
a state treasurer, an attorney-general and a state engineer and 
surveyor; and the governor appoints, subject to the approval 
of the Senate, a superintendent of public works, a superintendent 
of state prisons, a superintendent of insurance, a superintendent 
of banks, a commissioner of excise, a commissioner of agri- 
culture, a forest, fish and game commissioner, a commissioner 
of health, a commissioner of labour, a state architect, a state 
historian, a state librarian, two public service commissions, 
a civil service commission, a board of charities, a commission 
of prisons, a commission in lunacy, three tax commissioners 
and several other boards and commissions. The governor has 
the power, also, of filling vacancies in certain state offices and 
on the benches of the supreme court and county courts, and 
he may remove or suspend certain county and municipal officers 
on charges. 

The first state constitution gave the veto power to a council of 
revision composed of the governor, the chancellor and the judges 
of the supreme court, but since 1821 this power has been exercised 
by the governor alone; and in 1874 it was extended to separate 
items in appropriation bills. A bill or item of an appropriation bill 
that has been vetoed by the governor can become a law only with 
the approval of two-thirds of the members elected to each house of 
the legislature. So long as the legislature is in session the governor 
is allowed ten days, besides Sundays, to consider a bill, and if he does 
not veto it within that time it becomes a law, but no bill becomes a 
law after the final adjournment of the legislature unless it is actually 
approved by the governor within thirty days after the adjourn- 
ment. The governor's power to grant reprieves, commutations or 
pardons is unrestricted by any board of pardons, but he is required 
to report to the legislature each case in which he exercises such 
power. A candidate for the office of governor or lieutenant-governor 
must be at least thirty years of age and must have resided within the 
state for five years next preceding his election. The governor's 
salary is $10,000 a year, and the lieutenant-governor's is $5000. 

Legislature. — The legislative power is vested in a Senate of 
50 members elected biennially and an Assembly of 1 50 members 
elected annually. Since 1846 both senators and assemblymen 
have been elected by single districts, and ever since the state 
government was established they have been apportioned accord- 
ing to population, but the present constitution limits the repre- 
sentation of New York City in the Senate by declaring that no 
county shall have more than one-third of all the senators nor 
any two adjoining counties more than one-half of them. The 
first and second state constitutions required that every senator 
should be a freeholder, but since 1846 no property qualifications 
have been prescribed for membership in either house; the only 
persons disqualified are those who at the time of the election 
or within one hundred days before the election were members 
of Congress, civil or military officers under the United States, 
or officers under any city government. The constitution of 
1846 limited the pay of members of both houses to three dollars 
a day and to three hundred dollars for any one session (except 
in impeachment proceedings) besides an allowance for travelling 
expenses, but since an amendment of 1874 they have been paid 
$1500 a year and ten cents a mile for travelling expenses. 

The legislature meets in annual sessions, beginning in January. 
Money bills may originate in either house, but at the final vote on 
such a bill in either house three-fifths of the members elected to that 
house must be present and the yeas and nays must be recorded; 
bilte entailing appropriations for local or private purposes must 
receive a two-thirds majority to pass. The legislature appoints the 
board of regents of the University of the State of New York. To 
decrease the evil of lobbying a law was enacted in 1906 which requires 
that every person employed to promote or oppose the passage of any 
bill shall file in the office of the secretary of state a written statement 
showing who has employed him and describing the legislation in 
respect of which his services are to be rendered; the law also re- 
quires the employers of lobbyists to file in the same office within two 
months after the adjournment of the legislature an itemized state- 
ment of all their lobbying expenses, and forbids the employment of a 
lobbyist for a contingent fee. 

Judiciary. — At the close of the colonial era there were a 
court of chancery, a supreme court, circuit courts and courts 
of oyer and terminer which were held in the several counties 
by the justices of the supreme court, a court of common pleas 
and a court of sessions in each county, and courts held by justices 
of the peace in the several towns. This system, with the addition 
of the Senate, the chancellor and the justices of the supreme 
court occasionally sitting as a court for the correction of errors, 
was retained with only slight changes until 1846. But the new 
constitution of that year substituted a court of appeals for the 
court of errors, merged the court of chancery into the supreme 
court, established in each county a new county court composed 
of a single judge, and, taking the appointment of judges from 
the governor, gave the election of them to the people. Some 
further alterations in the constitution affecting the courts were 
made in 1869, 1879, 1888, 1894, 1899 and 1909, and the system 
as at present constituted comprises a supreme court of ninety- 
seven justices, an appellate division of the same, a court of 
appeals, a court of claims and local courts. The highest judicial 
court in the state is not, as in most states of the Union, the 
supreme court, but the court of appeals. This court consists 
of a chief judge and six associate judges elected from the state 
at large for a term of fourteen years. Its jurisdiction is limited, 
except where judgment is of death, to a review of questions of 
law. Vacancies are temporarily filled from among the justices 
of the supreme court by the governor. To expedite business, 
at the request of the court, the governor may designate not more 
than four justices of the supreme court to act temporarily as 
additional associate judges of the court of appeals. The salary of 
the chief judge is $14,200, of the associate judges $13,700 a year. 

The ninety -seven justices of the supreme court are elected for 
fourteen years from the nine districts into which the state is divided. 
Of these thirty are chosen in the first district (New York county) and 
seventeen in the second district (Long Island and Staten Island). 
The jurisdiction of each justice extends over the entire state. 
Vacancies are temporarily filled by the governor. Tne supreme 
court has general jurisdiction in law and equity, including all actions 
both civil and criminal. The salary of the justices in the first district 
and in Kings county of the second district is $17,500 a year; in the 
remainder of the second district it is $16,300 a year; in the other 
districts it is $10,000 a year. The state is divided into four depart- 
ments for each of which there is an Appellate Division consisting of 
seven justices in the first department (county of New York) and five 
in each of the others. The justices and presiding justice are desig- 
nated from among the justices of the supreme court by the governor; 
the presiding justice and a majority of the other justices of each de- 
partment must be residents of the department. 

The court of claims consists of three judges, one presiding, ap- 
pointed by the governor for a term of six years. It has jurisdiction 
to hear and determine private claims against the state. 

The local judiciary includes the usual county and city judges, 
county surrogates and justices of the peace. New York City {q.v.) 
has an extensive judiciary system of its own. 

Local Government. — The state is divided into sixty-one 
counties, each (unless wholly included in a city) having a county 
board of supervisors elected for two years, one from every town 
or city ward. This board has certain administrative and legis- 
lative powers, such as the care of county property, the borrowing 
of money for the erection of county buildings, the fixing of the 
salary of the county treasurer and of other county officers, the 
levying of county taxes and the division of the county into 
assembly districts and school commissioners' districts. Other 
county officers are a county judge and a county surrogate elected 
for a term of six years, a treasurer, a clerk, a district attorney, 
a sheriff and from one to four coroners elected for a term of 
three years. Cities are of three classes: (1) those having a 
population of 175,000 or more; (2) those having a population 
between 50,000 and 175,000; and (3) those whose population 
is less than 50,000; the classification is according to the latest 
state enumeration. 

Bills for " special " city laws, as opposed to *' general," must be 
approved (within fifteen days after their passage by both houses of 
the legislature) by the mayor of the city in first-class cities (in which, 
however, the state legislature may provide for the concurrence of the 
municipal legislative body), and in other cities by the mayor and 
council, before it is laid before the governor: if it is passed by the 
state legislature over the mayor's veto it goes direct to the governor. 
All city elections areheld in odd numbered years. The organization 
of cities and villages is provided by the legislature, which may restrict 
their powers of taxation and of contracting debts and may fix 
salaries. Town (or township) government in New York somewhat 
resembles that of New England; the chief executive officer of the 
town is a supervisor, who represents his town in the county " board 
of supervisors." 

National Guard. — The national guard of the state is commanded 
under the governor by a ma tor-general. It consists of four brigades 
each commanded by a brigadier-general. The establishments in 1910 
consisted of thirteen regiments and fifty separate companies of 
infantry, two squadrons and two troops of cavalry, four light 
batteries, one regiment of engineers, a signal corps of two companies 
and a naval militia, commanded by a captain and consisting of 
two battalions and two separate divisions. 

Laws. — A married woman has full control of her property whether 
acquired before or after marriage, and she may carry on any business, 
trade or occupation in her own right. A husband or a wife may 
convey real property directly to the other. A widow has a dower 
right in one-third of the real property to which her husband had 
absolute title, but a wife may convey or devise her real property free 
from her husband's right of tenancy by courtesy. The only ground 
for divorce is adultery. As soon as a divorce has been granted the 
plaintiff may marry again, but the defendant is not permitted to 
marry within the state any one except the plaintiff until five years 
have elapsed, and then only in case the court permits it because of 
the petitioner's uniformly good conduct in the meantime. Since the 
1st of January 1908 a marriage licence has been required for every 
lawful marriage. 

A homestead consisting of a lot of land with one or more buildings, 
and properly designated as, such in the office of the county clerk, but 
not exceeding $1000 in value, is exempt from forced sale so long as it is 
owned and occupied as a residence by a householder having a family 
or by a married woman, except to^ recover the purchase money, to 
satisfy a judgment obtained before it was designated as a homestead, 
or to collect taxes upon it. Personal property consisting of necessary 
household furniture, working tools and team of horses, professional 
instruments and a library, not exceeding $250 m value, besides the 
necessary food for the team for ninety days, provisions for the 
family, wearing apparel, wages or other income not exceeding $12 
a week, and several other things, when owned by a householder or 
person providing for a family, are also exempt from seizure for debt, 
unless the debt be for purchase money or for services performed in 
the family by a domestic. 

Eight hours constitute a legal day's work for all employees except 
those engaged in farm labour or domestic service. The employ- 
ment of children under fourteen years of age in any factory is for- 
bidden. Until sixteen years of age no child is to be so employed 
without an employment certificate issued by a commissioner of 
health, and showing that the child has completed an eight years 1 
course of study in a public school of the state or has had an equivalent 
schooli ng elsewhere. For children under sixteen years of age who are 
so employed the hours of labour are limited to eight a day and the 
days to six a week, and such children must not begin work before 
eight o'clock in the morning or continue after five o'clock in the 
evening. For children between sixteen and eighteen years of age 
and for women the hours of labour in a factoiy are limited to ten a 
day, unless to prepare for a short day or a holiday, and the days to 
six a week. The employment of children under fourteen years of 
age in any mercantile establishment, business office, hotel, restaurant 
or apartment house is also forbidden, except that in villages and in 
cities of the second or third class children upwards of twelve years of 
age may be so employed during the summer vacation of the public 
schools. For both boys and girls sixteen years of age or upward the 
restrictions are removed for two weeks at Christmas time. 1 The 
Employers' Liability Act of 1902 (amended and broadened in 1910) 
holds an employer liable for damages in any case in which one of his 
employees sustains a personal injury by reason of the negligence of 
the employer, of a sub-contractor, of a superintendent, or any other 
person in the employer's service whose duty it was to see that "the 
ways,jworks or machinery connected with or used in the business," 
were in proper condition, or whose duty it was to "direct . . . any 
employee," if it is not proved that the employee failed in due care and 
diligence; by another law of 1910 in certain dangerous employments 
the employer is liable unless the injured employee was negligent. 

Although the constitution of 1894 expressly declares that " any 
lottery or the sale of lottery tickets, pool-selling, book-making, or 
any other kind of gambling " shall not " hereafter be authorized or 
allowed within the state * and directs the legislature to pass ap- 

	1 For further regulations relating to the employment of women and 
	children see the Labour Law enacted in 1909 and the subsequent 
	amendments. 

propriate laws prohibiting the same, the legislature passed an act 
in 1895, which in practice permitted pool-selling and book-making 
at race-tracks, but in 1908 and 1910 bills were enacted prohibiting 
gambling at race-tracks. License to sell intoxicating liquors is 
subject to a graduated tax. The sale of liquor on Sunday or between 
one o'clock and five o'clock in the morning of any other day is unlaw- 
ful. Any town (but not any city) may at its option wholly forbid the 
sale of intoxicating liquors, may allow it to be sold only on condition 
that it be not drunk on the vendor's premises, or may allow it to be 
sold only by hotel-keepers and pharmacists, or by pharmacists alone. 

Administrative Commissions. — The regulation and control 
of such public service corporations as own or operate steam, 
electric or street railways, gas or electric plants, and express 
companies were, in 1907, vested in two public service com- 
missions (the first for New York City and the second for all other 
parts of the state), each of five members appointed by the 
governor with the approval of the Senate; in 1910 the regula- 
tion of telephone and telegraph companies throughout the state 
was vested in the second commission. 

A state civil service commission (1883) consists of three 
members (not more than two of the same political party) 
appointed by the governor with the approval of the Senate. For 
the classified service of the state and of the minor civil divisions, 
except cities, the commission makes rules (subject to the 
governor's approval and to statutory and constitutional pro- 
visions) governing the classification of offices, the examination 
of candidates for office, and the appointment and promotion of 
employees. In cities the mayor is required to appoint a municipal 
civil service commission, with similar duties; not more than two- 
thirds of the members may be of the same political party. 

Prisons, Poor Law, Char ities, &c. — Penal institutions for saneadults, 
except reformatories for women, are under the general supervision 
of a state commission of prisons; hospitals for the insane are under 
the general supervision of a state commission in lunacy ; and all other 
charitable and penal institutions, maintained wholly or in part by 
the state, or by any county, city or town within the state, are under 
the general supervision of a state board of charities. This board of 
charities consists of one member from each of the nine judicial 
districts and three additional members from the City of New York, 
all appointed by the governor with the consent of the Senate for a 
term of eight years. Its existence dates from 1867, but its authority 
was very limited, chiefly advisory, until 1895. Since then, however, 
its powers have been greatly increased. In 1910 the state charitable 
institutions were as follows: State Soldiers' and Sailors' Home, 
Bath; State School for the Blind, Batavia; the Thomas Indian 
School, Iroquois; State Woman's Relief Corps Home, Oxford; 
State Hospital for the care of Crippled and Deformed Children, West 
Haverstraw; Syracuse State Institution for Feeble-Minded Children, 
Syracuse; State Hospital for the treatment of Incipient Pulmonary 
Tuberculosis, Ray Brook; Craig Colony for Epileptics, Sonyea; 
State Custodial Asylum for Feeble-Minded Women, Newark; Rome 
State Custodial Asylum for Unteachable Idiots, Rome; State Agri- 
cultural and Industrial School, Industry; State Training School 
for Girls, Hudson; Western House of Refuge, Albion; New York 
State Reformatory for Women, Bedford; the State Training School 
for Boys; and Letchworth Village, a custodial asylum for epileptics 
and feeble-minded. Eight private institutions for the care or the 
care and instruction of deaf mutes and one for the care of the blind 
are supported mainly by the state. Many other charitable institu- 
tions receive public money, mostly from counties, cities and towns. 

The poor law of the state defines the town poor as those who have 
gained a settlement in some town or city, by residing there for one 
year prior to their application for public relief and who are unable 
to maintain themselves; the county poor as the poor who have not 
resided in any one town or city for one year before their application 
for public relief, but have been in some one county for sixty days; 
and the state poor as all other poor persons within the state. Wher- 
ever cared for, each town, city, county and the state must pay the 
cost of maintaining its own poor. In some counties there is no 
distinction between town and county poor, but In 1910 only one 
county had not a county superintendent for the general supervision 
and care of the poor; towns and cities not subject to special pro- 
visions intrusted public relief to one or more overseers of the poor or 
to commissioners of charities. In counties lacking adequate hospital 
accommodation a poor person requiring medical or surgical treatment 
may be sent to the nearest hospital approved by the state board of 
.charities. An Act of 19 10 provides that indigent soldiers, sailors or 
marines of the U.S. and their families be cared for in their homes 
and not in almshouses. 

The first state insane asylum, designed chiefly for recent and 
curable cases, was opened at Utica in 1843. Since 1896 every public 
institution for the insane has been maintained and administered as 
a part of the state system. A state commissioner in lunacy was first 
appointed in 1874; this officer was replaced in 1889 by a com- 
mission in lunacy, which in 1894 was placed at the head of the 
administration of the state's insanity law. This commission consists 
of three members appointed by the governor with the consent of the 
Senate. Its president must be a physician and alienist, and another 
member must be a lawyer. The commission appoints a board of 
experts to examine all immigrants suspected of insanity or allied 
mental disorders in order to prevent the admission of the insane 
into the country. In 1910 there were fourteen state hospitals 
(corresponding to fourteen state hospital districts) for the poor and 
indigent insane; these were at Utica, Willard, Poughkeepsie, 
Buffalo, Middletown (homoeopathic), Binghamton, Rochester, 
Ogdensburg, Gowanda (homoeopathic), Flatbush, Ward's Island, 
King's Park, Central I slip and Yorktown. There were also in 1910 
two hospitals for the criminal insane, at Matteawan and Dannemora. 
Each of these is under the immediate control of a superintendent 
appointed by the superintendent of state prisons. 

The state commission of* prisons consists of seven members ap- 
pointed by the governor with the consent of the Senate for a term of 
four years, and the institutions under its supervision in 1910 were 
the Sing Sing State Prison, 1 at Ossining, the Auburn State Prison at 
Auburn, the Clinton State Prison at Dannemora, the New York 
State Reformatory at Elmira, the Eastern New York Reformatory 
at Napanoch, five county penitentiaries, and all other institutions 
for the detention of sane adults charged with or convicted of crime, 
or retained as witnesses or debtors. The state prisons are under a 
superintendent of state prisons, appointed by the governor, with the 
consent of the Senate, for five years; and the state reformatories are 
managed by a board of seven managers similarly appointed for seven 
years. In the state reformatory at Elmira (which, like that at 
Napanoch, is for men between sixteen and thirty years of age who 
have been convicted of a state prison offence for the first time only), 
the plan of committing adult felons on an indeterminate sentence to 
be determined by their behaviour was first tested in America in 1877, 
and it has proved so satisfactory that it has been in part adopted 
for the state prisons. In order to minimize competition between 
prison labour and free labour, articles manufactured in the state 
prisons, the reformatories and the penitentiaries, are sold only to the 
institutions and departments of the state and its political divisions. 

Education. — The first school was established by the Dutch at 
New Amsterdam (now New York City) as early as 1633, an d at the 
close of the Dutch period there was a free elementary school in nearly 
every settlement. But from the English conquest to the close of the 
colonial era the chief purpose of the' government with respect to 
education was to prepare leaders for the state church; to this end 
King's College was founded in 1754, and from 1704 to 1776 the other 
schools were principally those maintained by the Society for the 
Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts. Hardly any schools 
remained in operation throughout the War of Independence. In 
January 1784 Governor George Clinton recommended legislation for 
the " revival and encouragement of seminaries of learning," with the 
result that the legislature passed an act establishing a state university 
of which Columbia College, formerly King's, was the " mother " 
portion. In 1787 a second university act was passed which restored 
to Columbia College the substance of its original charter and made the 
University of the State of New York an exclusively executive body 
with authority to incorporate new colleges and academies and to 
exercise over them the right of visitation. In 1795 an act was passed 
which formed the basis of the present elementary-school system. 
This act appropriated £20,000 annually for five yea rs for the establish- 
ment and maintenance of elementary schools, required each city and 
town to raise by taxation a sum for the same purpose equal to one- 
half of its share from the proceeds of the state fund, and provided for 
the election of school commissioners in each town and of trustees of 
each school. The state appropriation was discontinued in 1800; 
but in 1805 the proceeds of the sale of 500,000 acres of land were set 
apart for a permanent school fund, and in 1812, when the interest on 
this fund had become nearly $50,000 a year, the amount required 
before any of it could be distributed for school purposes, the common- 
school system was permanently established by an act which restored 
the main features of that of 1795, except that a superintendent of 
schools chosen by the council of appointment was now placed at its 
head. Although the interest on the state fund had risen to $70,000 
in 1 8 19, this together with an equal sum raised by the cities and 
towns was insufficient, and to meet the deficiency the patrons in each 
district were required by a " rate bill " to contribute in proportion 
to the attendance of their children. The schools were made free only 
after a memorable contest against the " rate bill." The framers 
of the constitution of 1846 were nearly equally divided on this 
question. In 1849 the legislature passed a free-school bill subject to 
the approval of the people. The people approved by a vote of nearly 
three to one, but the court of appeals declared the act unconstitu- 
tional because of the referendum. In 1851 a compromise measure 
was substituted, increasing the state appropriation to $800,000 and 
* exempting indigent parents from the '* rate bill," which was finally 
abolished in 1867. The administration of the common school 
system was in the hands of a state superintendent of schools from 
1 81 3 to 1 82 1, of the secretary o f state from 1 82 1 to 1854, and of a

	prison in the eastern part of the state to take the place of Sing Sing 
	Prison. 

superintendent of public instruction from 1854 to 1904. In the 
meantime the functions of the university had been extended to 
include an oversight of the professional, scientific and technical 
schools, the administration of laws relating to admission to the 
professions, the charge of the State Library at Albany, the super- 
vision of local libraries, the custody of the State Museum and the 
direction of all scientific work prosecuted by the state. This dual 
system was consolidated by the Educational Unification Act of 1904, 
in conformity with which the university regents have become a 
legislative body, subordinate to the state legislature, for determining 
ttte general educational policy of the state, and a commissioner of 
education acts as the chief executive, advisory and supervisory, 
officer of the whole educational system. 

The regents of the University are chosen by the legislature, one 
retiring each year; and an act of 1909 requires that their number 
shall at all times be three more than the number of judicial districts. 
The first commissioner of education was chosen by the legislature for 
a term of six years, but it was arranged that his successor should be 
chosen by the regents and continue in office during their pleasure. 
The commissioner (subject to approval of the regents) appoints three 
assistant commissioners, for higher, secondary and elementary educa- 
tion respectively. The elementary school is administered by a school 
commissioner in each of the school commissioner's districts into 
which a county may be divided, by one trustee or three trustees in 
each separate school district, and by a board of education in each 
city, village or union free school district having more than three 
hundred children. Any two or more adjoining school districts may 
unite to form a union free school district, and in any village or union 
free school district having a population of 5000 or more the board of 
education may appoint a superintendent of schools. 

The compulsory education law as amended in 3907 and 1009 
requires the full attendance at a public school, or at a school which is 
an approximate equivalent, of all children who are between seven 
and fourteen years of age, are in the proper physical and mental 
condition, and reside in a city or school district having a population 
of 5000 or more and employing a superintendent of schools; in such 
a city or district children between fourteen and sixteen years must 
attend school unless they obtain an employment certificate and are 
regularly engaged in some useful employment or service; and 
outside of such a city or district all children between the ages of 
eight and fourteen years and those between fourteen and sixteen 
years who are not regularly employed must attend school on all 
school days from October to June. In a city of the first or second 
class every boy between fourteen and sixteen years of age who'has an 
employment certificate, but has not completed the course of study 
prescribed for the elementary public schools or the equivalent, must 
attend an evening school not less than six hours each week for a 
period of not less than sixteen weeks each year, or a trade school not 
less than eight hours a week for sixteen weeks a year. By a law of 
1908 the board of education of any city is authorized to establish 
industrial schools for children who have completed the elementary 
school course or have attained the age of fourteen years, and trade 
schools for children who are more than sixteen years old and have 
completed the^ elementary school course or a course offered by any 
of the industrial schools. For the training of teachers for the ele- 
mentary schools the state maintains ten normal schools at Oswego 
(1863), Cortland (1866), Fredonia (1866), Potsdam (1866), Gcneseo 
(1867), Brockport (1867), Buffalo (1867), New Paltz (1885), Oneonta 
(1887) and Plattsburg (1890); it also appropriates $700 annually for 
each teachers* training class in about one hundred of the secondary 
schools. The State Normal College at Albany, founded in 1844 as 
the first state normal school, is designed principally for the training 
of teachers for the secondary schools, about 800 high schools and 
academies, supported wholly or in part by the state. 

The state controls professional and technical schools through the 
regents* examinations of candidates for admission to such schools 
and to the professions, determines the minimum requirements for 
admission to college by the regents* academic examinations, main- 
tains the large State Library and the valuable State Museum, and 
occasionally makes a gift to a college or a. university for the support 
of courses in practical industries; but it maintains no college or 
university that is composed of a teaching body. To Cornell Uni- 
versity (g.f.), a non-sectarian institution opened at Ithaca in 1868, the 
state turned over the proceeds from the National land-grant act of 
1862 on condition that it should admit free one student annually 
f roni each Assembly district, and in 1909 a still closer relation between 
this institution and the state was established by an act which makes 
the governor, lieutenant-governor, speaker of the Assembly and 
commissioner of education ex-x>fficio members of its board of trustees, 
and authorizes the governor with the approval of the Senate to 
appoint five other members, one each year. 

Among the institutions of higher learning in the state, besides 
Columbia University (g.v.) and Cornell University (ff.r.), are: Union 
University (1795, non-sectarian), at Schenectady; Hamilton 
College (1812, non-sectarian), at Clinton; Colgate University (1819, 
non-sectarian), at Hamilton ; Hobart College (1822, non-sectarian), at 
Geneva; Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (1824, non-sectarian), at 
Troy; New York University (1832, non-sectarian), in New-York 
City; Alfred University (1836, non-sectarian), at Alfred; Fordham 
University (1841, Roman Catholic), in New York City; College of 
St Francis Xavier (1847, Roman Catholic), in New York City; 
College of the City of New York (1849, city) ; University of Rochester 
(1850, Baptist), at Rochester; Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn 
<i854, non-sectarian), at Brooklyn; Niagara University (1856, 
Roman Catholic), at Niagara Falls; St Lawrence University (1858, 
non-sectarian), at Canton; St Bona venture's College (1859, Roman 
Catholic), at St Bonaventure; St Stephen's College (i860, Pro- 
testant Episcopal), at Annandale; Manhattan College (1863, Roman 
Catholic), at New York City; St John's College (1870, Roman 
Catholic), at Brooklyn; Canisius College (1870, Roman Catholic), 
at Buffalo; Syracuse University (1871, Methodist Episcopal), at 
Syracuse; Adelphi College (1896, non-sectarian), at Brooklyn; and 
Clarkson School of Technology (1896, non-sectarian), at Potsdam. 
The United States Military Academy (1802) is at West Point. 

Finance, — In New York the direct property tax is levied by and 
for the benefit of localities. Revenues for state purposes are derived 
from special taxes collected from the liquor traffic, corporations, 
transfers of decedents' estates, transfers of shares of stock, recording 
tax on mortgages, sales of products of state institutions, fees of 
public officers including fines and penalties, interest on deposits of 
state funds, refunds from department examinations and revenue 
from investments of trust funds, the most important of which are the 
common school fund and the United States deposit fund. A board 
of three tax commissioners has supervision of methods of assessment 
within the state, and with the commissioners of the land office 
constitutes the state board of equalization. The county super- 
visors, with or without the aid of three commissioners whom they are 
authorized to appoint for the purpose, constitute a county board of 
equalization. The recording tax on mortgages, amounting to one- 
half of 1 % of the principal sums secured, is collected by the record- 
ing officers under the supervision of the state board of tax com- 
missioners. The administration of the liquor tax law is under the 
supervision of the state commissioner of excise and his deputies. 
The tax on corporations, originating as a capital stock tax in 1880 
and extended through succeeding years, is administered by the state 
•comptroller. The comptroller also has charge of the enforcement of 
the stock transfer tax act and of the laws imposing taxes upon the 
transfer of decedents' estates. The aggregate of taxes received by 
the state treasury through the comptroller's department for the fiscal 
year ending September 30, 1909, was $23,000,000. 

On the 30th of September 1909 the state debt, most of which was 
•created since 1895 for the purpose of canal improvements, amounted 
to $41,230,660.^ The surplus in the treasury was $8,435,848, the 
total amount in trust and sinking funds was $31,301,501. The 
constitution prohibits the legislature from lending the state's credit 
or incurring an indebtedness for current expenses in excess of 
$1,000,000 or incurring any^ indebtedness whatever, other than for 
war purposes, unless such indebtedness be authorized by lav: for 
" some single work or object," the law to be approved by the people 
at a general election and providing for a direct annual tax sufficient 
to pay the interest and to liquidate the debt within eighteen years. 
That instrument further prohibits each county, city, town and 
village from lending its credit and from creating an indebtedness in 
excess of 10% of the assessed valuation of its real estate. 

The first state institution to receive a bank charter was the bank 
of New York, incorporated in 1791. In 1804 free banking was re- 
stricted to such an extent as to give practically a monopoly of the 
business to associations receiving special charters, and as these 
charters were generally awarded as favours to politicians the system 
was 'a formidable agency of corruption. Chiefly because of these 
evils the constitution of 1821 required the assent of two-thirds of the 
members elected to each house of the legislature to pass an act 
•creating a corporation. In 1829 the Safety-Fund Act was passed, 
which required each bank thereafter chartered or rechartered to pay 
into the state treasury 3 % of its capital stock other than that owned 
by the state, and from this fund the debts of insolvent banks were to 
be paid. The fund became exhausted by many failures, and a free 
banking law was enacted in 1838. The constitution of 1846 pro- 
hibited the legislature from granting any special charters for bank- 
ing purposes, and consequently no more safety-fund banks were 
established. At the same time the free-banking system has been 
greatly improved. The state banks still have the right to issue 
currency, but the heavy tax on currency issue imposed by Congress 
in 1866 (after the introduction of the National banking system in 
1863) put a stop to the practice. In 1851 a state banking depart- 
ment was created, and at the head of this is a superintendent of banks 
appointed by the governor, with the consent of the Senate, for a term 
-of three years. The superintendent — or examiners appointed by 
him (from a civil service list) — is required to examine every bank 
and every trust company at least twice each year, each building and 
loan association at least once a year, and every savings bank at 
least once in two years. The law provides specifically as to the in- 
vestment of deposits made in savings banks with the evident purpose 
of providing the greatest possible security to depositors. State 
banks must carry from 15% to 25% reserve and trust companies 
from 10% to 15% reserve, depending upon location. 

The introduction of the National banking system caused a decrease 
in the number of state banks from 309 in '1863 to 45 in 1868, but their 
number has increased steadily since 1880 and in 1909 there were 202. 
In the same year there were 140 savings-banks, 85 trust companies, 46 
safe deposit companies, 255 building and loan associations and other 
miscellaneous corporations, with total resources of $3,833,500,000 
under the supervision of the banking department of the state. 
This is over 21 % of the entire banking power of the United States. 

To correct abuses in the life insurance "business which were dis- 
covered in 1905 by a committee of the state legislature, laws were 
passed in the next year regulating the election of the directors of the 
insurance companies, and the investments of the companies and 
the distribution of dividends, limiting the amount of business of the 
larger companies and prohibiting rebates on insurance premiums. A 
state superintendent of insurance, (since i860) appointed by the 
governor, holds office for three years. 

History. — The aboriginal inhabitants of New York had an 
important influence on its colonial history. Within its limits 
from the upper Hudson westward to the Genesee river was the 
home of that powerful confederacy of Indian tribes, the Mohawks, 
Oneidas, Onondagas, Cayugas and Senecas, known to the French 
as the Iroquois and to the English as the Five (later Six) Nations. 
When supplied with firearms by Europeans they reduced a 
number of other trihes to subjection and extended their dominion 
over most of the territory from the St Lawrence to the Tennessee 
and from the Atlantic to the Mississippi. They were at the 
height of their power about 1700. Of much less influence in 
New York were several Algonquian tribes in the lower valley 
of the Hudson and along the sea coast. 

New York Bay and the Hudson river were discovered by 
Giovanni da Verrazano in 1524, and were probably seen by 
Estevan Gomez in 1525; for many years following French 
vessels occasionally ascended the Hudson to trade with the 
Indians. The history of New York really begins, however, in 
1609. In July of that year Samuel de Champlain discovered the 
lake which bears his name and on its shores led his Algonquian 
Indian allies against the Iroquois, thus provoking against his 
countrymen the hostility of a people who for years were to hold 
the balance of power between the English and the French in 
America. On the 3rd of September Henry Hudson, in the 
employ of the Dutch East India Company, entered New York 
Bay in the " Half Moon " in search of the " northwest passage." 
He conceived that a vast trade with the Iroquois for furs might 
be established; his report aroused great interest in Holland; 
and the United Netherlands, whose independence had been 
acknowledged in the spring, claimed the newly discovered 
country. In 1610 a vessel was despatched with merchandise 
suitable for traffic with the Indians, the voyage resulted in 
profit, and a lucrative trade in peltry sprang up. Early in 1614 
Adriaen Block explored Long Island Sound and discovered 
Block Island. The merchants of Amsterdam and Hoorn soon 
formed themselves into the New Netherland Company, and on 
the nth of October 1614 received from the States- General a 
three years' monopoly of the Dutch fur trade in New Netherland, 
i.e. that part of America between New France and Virginia, or 
between latitudes 40 and 45° N. Late in the same year or early 
in 1615 a stockaded trading post called Fort Nassau was erected 
on Castle Island, now within the limits of Albany, and a few 
huts were erected about this time or earlier on the southern 
extremity of Manhattan Island; but no effort at colonization 
was as yet made. In 1617 the Dutch negotiated with the Iroquois 
a treaty of peace and alliance. Fort Nassau was soon removed 
to the mouth of Tawasentha Creek. On the expiration of the 
charter of the New Netherland Company (1618) the States- 
General refused to grant a renewal, and only private ventures 
were authorized until 1621, when the West India Company 
(q.v.) was chartered for a term of twenty-four years; to this 
company was given a monopoly of Dutch trade with the whole 
American coast from Newfoundland to the Straits of Magellan. 
It was authorized to plant colonies and to govern them under 
a very limited supervision of the States-General, such as the 
approval of its appointment of a governor and of its instructions 
to him; and its own government was vested in five chambers 
of directors and an executive board or college of nineteen 
delegates from those chamhers, eight of the nineteen representing 
the Chamber of Amsterdam. New Netherland became one of 
the more important interests of the Company. In June 1623, 
however, New Netherland was formally erected into a province 
and the management of its affairs assigned to the Chamber of 
Amsterdam, which in March 1624 despatched the " New Nether- 
land," with the first permanent colonists (thirty families mostly 
Walloon), under Cornells Jacobsen Mey, the first governor 
or director of the colony. Arriving at Manhattan early in May, 
a few of the men remained there, another small party established 
a temporary post (Fort Nassau) on the Delaware river, and 
still another began a fortified settlement on the site of the 
present Hartford, Connecticut. But more than one-half of the 
families proceeded up the Hudson to Fort Orange, the successor 
of Fort Nassau, at the mouth of Tawasentha Creek, and there 
founded what is now Albany. Three more vessels arrived in 
1625, and when in that year Mcy was succeeded as director by 
William Verhulst the colony had a population of 200 or more. 
The government of the province was fully established in 1626 
and was vested mainly in a director-general and council. The 
director-general was formally appointed by the Company subject 
to the approval of the States-General, but the Amsterdam 
Chamber and the College of Nineteen supervised his admini- 
stration. The members of the council were formally appointed 
by the Company, but the director-general actually determined 
who they should be, and as he was not bound by their advice 
they were no check to an autocratic rule. Peter Minuit, the first 
director- general, arrived with more colonists in May 1626, and 
soon afterwards Manhattan Island was bought from the Indians, 
Fort Amsterdam was erected at its lower end, and the settlement 
here was made the seat of government. 

In 1629, chiefly to encourage agriculture, the Company issued 
its famous Charter of Privileges and Exemptions, which provided 
that any member might have anywhere in New Netherland 
except on Manhattan Island his choice of a tract of unoccupied 
land extending 16 m. along the seacoast or one side of a navigable 
river, or 8 m. along the river on both sides " and so far into the 
country as the situation of the occupyers will permit " by 
purchasing the same from the Indians and planting upon it a 
colony of fifty persons, upwards of 15 years old, within four years 
from the beginning of the undertaking, one-fourth part within 
one year; and that any private person might with the approval 
of the director-general and council take up as much land as he 
should be able to improve. The founder of a colony was styled 
a patroon, and, although the colonists were bound to him only 
by a voluntary contract for specified terms, the relations between 
them and the patroon during the continuance of the contract 
were in several important respects similar to those under the 
feudal system between the lord of a manor and his serfs. The 
patroon received his estate in perpetual inheritance and had the 
exclusive right of hunting and fishing upon it. Each colonist 
not only paid him a fixed rent, usually in kind, but had to share 
with him the increase of the stock and to have the grain ground 
at his mill. The patroon was the legal heir of all his colonists 
who died intestate. He had civil and criminal jurisdiction 
within the boundaries of his estate; he could create offices, 
found cities, and appoint officers and magistrates, and, although 
the charter permitted an appeal from his court to the director- 
general and council in any case in which the amount in dispute 
exceeded fifty guilders ($20), some of the patroons exacted 
from their colonists a promise not to avail themselves of the 
privilege. The Company promised to permit the patroons 
to engage in the fur trade, wherever it had no commissary of 
its own, subject to a tax of one guilder (40 cents) on each skin, 
and to engage in other trade along the coast from Newfoundland 
to Florida subject to a tax of 5 % on goods shipped to Europe. 
The colonists of the patroons were exempted from all taxes for 
a period of ten years, but were forbidden to manufacture any 
cloth whatever. The charter did not give the encouragement 
to agriculture that was expected of it because the status created 
for colonists of a patroon was no attraction to a successful farmer 
■ in the Netherlands. Immediately after the issue of the charter 
a few of the more adroit directors of the Amsterdam Chamber 
hastened to acquire for themselves, as patroons, the tracts 
of land most favourably situated for trade. On both sides 
of the entrance to Delaware Bay Samuel Godyn, Samuel 
Blomaert and five other directors who were admitted to partner- 
ship in the second year (1630) established the manor and colony 
of Swaanendael; on a tract opposite the lower end of Manhattan 
Island and including Staten Island, Michael Pauw established 
the manor and colony of Pavonia; on both sides of the Hudson 
and extending in all directions from Fort Orange (Albany) 
Kilian van Rensselaer established the manor and colony of 
Rensselaerwyck. The colony of Swaanendael was destroyed by 
the Indians in 1632. Pauw maintained his colony of Pavonia 
for about seven years and then sold out to the Company. The 
colony of Rensselaerwyck was the only one that prospered under 
the patroon system. In the meantime the patroons had 
claimed unrestricted rights of trade within the boundaries of their 
estates. These were stoutly denied by the Company. Director- 
General Minuit was recalled in 1632 on the ground that he had 
been partial to the patroons; and Wouter van Twiller, who arrived 
in 1633, endeavoured to promote only tlie selfish commercial 
policy of the Company; at the close of his administration (1637) 
the affairs of the province were in a ruinous condition. 

William Kieft was appointed director-general late in 1637, 
and in 1638 the Company abandoned its monopoly of trade 
in New Netherland and gave notice that all inhabitants of the 
United Provinces, and of friendly countries, might trade there 
subject to an import duty of 10 %, an export duty of 15%, and 
to the requirement that the goods should be carried in the 
Company's ships. At the same time the director-general was 
instructed to issue to any immigrant applying for land a patent 
for as large a farm as he required for cultivation and pasturage, 
to be free of all charges for ten years and thereafter subject only 
to a quit-rent of one-tenth of the produce. Two years later, 
by a revision of the Charter of Privileges and Exemptions, the 
prohibition on manufactures was abolished, the privileges of 
the original charter with respect to patroons were extended 
to " all good inhabitants of the Netherlands," and the estate 
of a patroon was limited to 4 m. along the coast or a navigable 
river and 8 m. back into the country. The revised charter 
also provided that any one who brought over five colonists and 
established them in a new settlement should receive 200 acres, 
and if such a settlement grew to be a town or village it should 
receive a grant of municipal government. These inducements 
encouraged immigration not only from the Fatherland but from 
New England and Virginia. But the freedom of trade promoted 
dangerous relations with the Indians, and an attempt of Kieft 
to collect a tribute from the Algonquian tribes in the vicinity 
of Manhattan Island and other indiscretions of this officer pro- 
voked Indian hostilities (1 641-1645), during which most of the 
outlying settlements were laid waste. 

Out of this warfare arose an organized movement for a govern- 
ment in which the colonists should have a voice. In August 
1 64 1 Kieft called an assembly of the heads of families in the 
neighbourhood of Fort Amsterdam to consider the question of 
peace or war. The assembly chose a board of Twelve Men to 
represent it, and a few months later this board demanded certain 
reforms, especially that the membership of the director-general's 
council should be increased from one to five by the popular 
election of four members. Kieft promised the concessions to gain 
the board's consent to waging war, but later denied its authority 
to exact promises from him and dissolved it. At another crisis, 
in 1643, ne was obliged to call a second assembly of the people. 
This time a board of Eight Men was chosen to confer with him. 
It denied his right to levy certain war taxes, and when it had 
in vain protested to him against his arbitrary measures it sent 
a petition, in 1644, to the States-General for his recall, and this 
was granted. Peter Stuyvesant (q.v.)> his successor, arrived 
at Fort Amsterdam in May 1647. Under his rule there was a 
return of prosperity; from 1653 to 1664 the population of 
the province increased from 2000 to 10,000. Stuyvesant was, 
however, extremely arbitrary. Although he permitted the exist- 
ence of a board of Nine Men to act as " tribunes " for the people 
it was originally composed of his selections from eighteen persons 
chosen at a popular election, and annually thereafter the places 
of six retiring members were filled by his selections from twelve 
persons nominated by the board. He treated it with increasing 
contempt, and the most that it could do was to remonstrate 
to the States-General. That body suggested a representative 
government, but this the Company refused to grant. 

Stuyvesant conducted a successful expedition against the 
Swedes on the southern border of New Netherland in 1655; 
but he was powerless against the English. The Dutch had 
long claimed the whole coast from Delaware Bay to Cape Cod, 
but by the treaty of Hartford (1650), negotiated between 
himself and the commissioners of the United Colonies of New 
England, Stuyvesant agreed to a boundary which on the mainland 
roughly determined the existing boundary between New York 
and Connecticut and on Long Island extended southward 
from the west side of Oyster Bay to the Atlantic Ocean. Not- 
withstanding the good claim to their province which the Dutch 
had established by discovery and occupancy, the government 
of Great Britain, basing its claim to the same territory on Cabot's 
discovery (1498), the patent to the London and Plymouth 
companies (1606), and the patent to the Council for New England 
(1620), contended that the Dutch were intruders. In 1653, 
during the war between England and Holland, the Dutch, 
fearing an English attack, built a wall, from which the present 
Wall Street was named, across Manhattan Island at what was 
then the northern limits of New Amsterdam. In the following 
year Cromwell actually sent out an expedition which, with the 
aid of New England, was to attempt the conquest, but before 
an attack was made peace was announced. The Connecticut 
Charter of 1662 included in that colony some settlements 
acknowledged by the treaty of Hartford to belong to New 
Netherland, and strife was renewed. Finally, in March 
1664, Charles II. formally erected into a province the whole 
territory from the west side of the Connecticut river to the 
east side of Delaware Bay together with all of Long Island 
and a few other dependencies of minor importance, and granted 
it to his brother James, the duke of York and Albany, as its 
lord proprietor. The duke appointed Colonel Richard Nicolls 
governor and placed him in command of an expedition to effect 
its conquest. Nicolls won over the burgomaster of New Amster- 
dam and other prominent citizens by the favourable terms 
which he offered, and Stuyvesant was forced, without fighting, 
into a formal surrender on the 8th of September. The duke's 
authority was proclaimed and New Netherland became New 
York. The separation from it of what is now New Jersey (q.v.) 
was begun by the duke's conveyance, in the preceding June, of 
that portion of his province to Berkeley and Carteret, and among 
numerous changes from Dutch to English names was that from 
Fort Orange to Fort Albany. A treaty of alliance with the 
Mohawks and Senecas procured for the English the same friendly 
relations with the Iroquois that the Dutch had enjoyed. The 
transition from Dutch to English institutions was effected 
gradually and the private rights of the Dutch were carefully 
preserved. The English executive, consisting of a governor 
and council, was much like the Dutch, but Nicolls, by his con- 
ciliatory spirit, made his administration more agreeable than 
Stuyvesant's. In the administration of local affairs some of the 
Dutch settlements were little disturbed until ten years or more 
after the conquest, but the introduction of English institutions 
into settlements wholly or largely English was begun in 1665 
by the erection of Long Island, Staten Island and Westchester 
into an English county under the name of Yorkshire, and by 
putting into operation in that county a code of laws known as 
the " Duke's Laws," This code was based largely on the laws 
of New England, and, although a source of popular discontent, 
it gave to the freeholders of each town a voice in the government 
of their town by permitting them to elect a board of eight over- 
seers which chose a constable and sat as a court for the trial of 
small causes. Nicolls resigned the governorship in 1668, but 
his successor, Francis Lovelace, continued his policy — autocratic 
government, arbitrary in form but mild in practice, and pro- 
gressive in the matter of religious toleration. In August 1673, 
Holland and England being at war, a Dutch fleet surprised 
New York, captured the city, and restored Dutch authority 
and the names of New Netherland and New Amsterdam. But 
by the treaty of Westminster, February 1674, the Dutch title 
to the province was finally extinguished, and in November the 
English again took possession. A new charter was issued to the 
duke to perfect his title and Edmund (later Sir Edmund) Andros, 
the new governor, was instructed to establish English institutions 
and enforce English law in all sections. In 1675 Andros estab- 
lished at Albany a commission for Indian affairs which long 
rendered important service in preserving the English-Iroquois 
alliance. The imperious manner of Andros made him many 
enemies. Some of them preferred charges against him relating 
to his administration of the revenue. He was called to England 
in 1 68 1 to answer these, and during his absence the demand for a 
representative assembly was accompanied with a refusal to pay 
the customs duties and so much other insubordination that the 
duke appointed Colonel Thomas Dongan to succeed Andros, 
and instructed him to call the desired assembly. It met at Fort 
James in the City of New York on the 17th of October 1683, 
was in session for about three weeks, and passed fifteen acts. 
The first, styled a charter of liberties and privileges, required 
that an assembly elected by the freeholders and freemen should 
be called at least once every three years; vested all legislative 
authority in the governor, council and assembly; forbade the 
imposition of any taxes without the consent of the assembly; 
and provided for religious liberty and trial by jury. Other acts 
divided the province into counties, established courts of justice, 
and provided for a revenue. In August 1684 when, by its charter, 
the western boundary of the province was not definitely extended 
beyond the Hudson, Dongan laid the basis of New York's claim 
to the western lands of the Iroquois by a new covenant with 
them in which they recognized the English as their protectors, 
and throughout his administration he was busy neutralizing 
French influence among the Iroquois and in diverting the fur 
trade of the north-west from the St Lawrence to Albany. The 
charter of liberties and privileges was approved by the duke, but 
before the news of this reached its authors the duke became 
King James II., and in 1686, when a frame of government for 
New York as a royal province was provided, the assembly was 
dispensed with. About the same time the new king adopted a 
policy for strengthening the imperial control over New England 
as well as for the erection of a stronger barrier against the 
French, and in 1688 New York and New Jersey were consoli- 
dated with the New England colonies into the Dominion of New 
England and placed under the viceregal authority of Sir Edmund 
Andros as governor-general. The news of the English revolution 
of 1688, however, caused an uprising in Boston, and in April 
1680 Andros was seized and imprisoned. Francis Nicholson as 
lieutenant-governor was still in quiet possession of the govern- 
ment of New York, and a majority of the population of the 
province were satisfied to await the outcome of the revolution 
in the mother country, but in the southern portion of the province, 
especially in the City of New York and on Long Island, were a 
number of restless spirits who were encouraged by the fall of 
Andros to take matters into their own hands. They found a 
leader in a German merchant, Jacob Leisler (q.v.). Leisler 
refused to pay duties on a cargo of wine on the ground that the 
collector was a " papist," and on the 31st of May r689, during 
a mutiny of the militia, he and other militia captains seized 
Fort James. In the following month Nicholson deserted his 
post and sailed for England, and Leisler easily gained possession 
of the city. To strengthen his position he called an assembly 
which conferred upon him the powers of a dictator. Some time 
after a copy of the order of the new monarchs (William and Mary) 
to continue all Protestants in their offices in the colonies had 
been received, Leisler falsely announced that he had received 
a commission as lieutenant-governor. He then attempted to 
revive the act of 1683 for raising revenue, but met with so much 
opposition that he issued writs for the election of another 
assembly. This, however, brought him chiefly petitions for 
the redress of grievances. Albany successfully defied his usurped 
authority until his recognition was necessary to a united front 
against the French and their Indian allies, who, in February 
1600, had surprised and burned Schenectady. Two other French 
attacks had at the same time been directed against New England, 
and to meet the dangerous situation Leisler performed the one 
statesmanlike act of his public career, notable in American 
history as the first step toward the union of the colonies. At 
his call, delegates from Massachusetts, Plymouth, Connecticut 
and Maryland met in New York City with delegates from New 
York on the ist of May 1690 to consider concerted action against 
the enemy, and although the expedition which they sent out 
was a failure it numbered 855 men, New York furnishing about 
one-half the men, Massachusetts one of the two commanders and 
Connecticut the other. Leisler had proclaimed the new monarchs 
of Great Britain and had declared that it was his purpose only 
to protect the province and the Protestant religion until the 
arrival of a governor appointed by them; but he was enraged 
when he learned that he had been ignored and that under the 
new governor, Colonel Henry Sloughter, his enemies, van 
Cortlandt and Bayard, had again been appointed to the council. 
When Major Richard Ingoldsby arrived with two companies 
of the king's soldiers and demanded possession of the fort, 
Leisler refused although he still professed his willingness to 
deliver it to Sloughter. On the 17th of March 169 1 Leisler's 
force fired on the king's soldiers, killing two and wounding 
several. Governor Sloughter arrived two days later, and the 
revolt terminated in the arrest of Leisler and his chief followers. 
Leisler and Jacob Milborne, his son-in-law, were pronounced 
guilty of treason, and were executed on the 16th of May. The 
execution was regarded even by many who had been indifferent 
to Leisler's cause, as an act of revenge. The case was carried 
to England, where in 1695 parliament reversed the attainders 
of the victims, and for many years the province was rent by the 
Leislerian and anti-Leislerian factions. 

Governor Sloughter, as his commission directed, re-established 
in 1 69 1 the assembly which James II. had abolished in 1686, 
and throughout the remainder of the colonial era the history 
of the province relates chiefly to the rise of popular government 
and the defence of the northern frontier. At its first session 
the assembly passed an act declaratory of the rights and privileges 
of the people, and much like the charter of liberties and privileges 
enacted in 1683, except that annual instead of triennial sessions 
of the assembly were now requested and, as was also provided in 
Sloughter's commission and instructions, religious liberty was 
denied to Roman Catholics. This act was disallowed by the 
crown in 1697, and until Governor Cornbury's administration 
(1 702-1 708) both the Leislerians and the anti-LeisIerians 
repeatedly bid for the governor's favour by supporting his 
measures instead of contending for popular rights. But Corn- 
bury 's embezzlement of £1500, appropriated for fortifying the 
Narrows connecting Upper and Lower New York Bay, united 
the factions against him and started the assembly in the im- 
portant contest which ended in the establishment of its control 
over the public purse. In 1706 it won the right to appoint its 
own treasurer to care for money appropriated for extraordinary 
purposes, and eight years later the governor assented to an act 
which gave to this officer the custody of practically all public 
money. Until 1737 it had been the custom to continue the 
revenue acts from three to five years, but thereafter the assembly 
insisted on annual appropriations. 

The first newspaper of New York, the New York Gazette, 
was established in 1725 by William Bradford as a semi- 
official organ of the administration. In 1733 a popular organ, 
the New York Weekly 'Journal, was established under John 
Peter Zenger (1 697-1 746), and in 1735 both the freedom of the 
press and a great advance toward the independence of the 
judiciary were the outcome of a famous libel suit against Zenger. 

Between the administration of Governor Montgomerie (1728- 
1731) and Governor Cosby (1732-1736) there was an interregnum 
, of thirteen months during which Rip van Dam, president of the 
council, was acting-governor, and upon Cosby's arrival a dispute 
arose between him and van Dam over the division of the salary 
and fees. Both appealed to the law, and when the chief-justice, 
Lewis Morris, refused Cosby's request to have the court proceed 
in equity jurisdiction, and denied the right of the governor to 
establish courts of equity, he was removed from office. Not 
long afterwards there appeared in the Weekly Journal some 
severe criticisms of the administration. For printing these 
Zenger was arrested for libel in November 1734. The case was 
not brought to trial until August 1735, and in the meantime 
Zenger was kept in jail. Originally he had for counsel two of 
the most able lawyers in the province, James Alexander (1690- 
1756) and William Smith (1697-1769), but when they excepted 
to the commissions of the chief-justice, James de Lancey 
(1 703-1 760) and one of his associates, because by these com- 
missions the justices had been appointed " during pleasure " 
instead of " during good behaviour," the chief justice disbarred 
them. Their places, however, were taken by Andrew Hamilton, 
speaker of the Assembly of Pennsylvania and a lawyer of great 
reputation in the English colonies. The jury quickly agreed 
on a verdict of not guilty, and the acquittal was greeted by the 
populace with shouts of triumph. The further independence of 
judges became a leading issue in 1761 when the assembly 
insisted that they should be appointed during good behaviour, 
and refused to pay the salaries of those appointed during pleasure; 
but the home government met this refusal by ordering that they 
be paid out of the quit-rents. 

The defence of the northern frontier was a heavy burden to 
New York, but by its problems the growth of the union of the 
colonies was promoted. From the destruction of Schenectady to 
the Peace of Ryswick (1697) hostilities between the French and 
the English in the New World took the form of occasional raids 
across the frontier, chiefly by the Indian allies. The main effort 
of the French, however, was, by diplomacy, to destroy the English- 
Iroquois alliance. This rested on the fear of the Iroquois for 
the French and their hope of protection from the English. 
Therefore, in response to their repeated complaints of the weak- 
ness of the English arising from disunion, Governor Fletcher, 
in 1694, called another intercolonial conference consisting of 
delegates from New York, Massachusetts, Connecticut and 
New Jersey, and urged the necessity of more united feelings. 
Open hostilities were interrupted for a few years by the Peace of 
Ryswick and for a longer period by the Peace of Utrecht (17 13), 
but French priests continued to dwell among the Iroquois, 
teaching them and distributing presents, and of the success of this 
diplomacy the English were ever in danger. To counteract 
it they, in 1701, prevailed upon the chiefs to deed their territory, 
said to be 800 m. in length and 400 m. in breadth, to the king of 
England. The English, also, frequently distributed presents. 
But the success of the French at the close of the 17th century 
and the early portion of the 18th was prevented only by the 
ceaseless efforts of Peter Schuyler (1657-1724) whose personal 
influence was for years dominant among all the Iroquois except 
the Senecas. When they had assumed a neutral attitude, he 
persuaded a number of them to join troops from New York, 
New Jersey and Connecticut in the unsuccessful expeditions of 
1709 and 1 71 1 against the French at Montreal. The English had 
a decided advantage over the French in that they could furnish 
goods for the Indian trade much cheaper than their rivals, and 
when Governor Burnet saw that this advantage was being lost 
by a trade between Albany and Montreal he persuaded the 
assembly to pass an act (1720) prohibiting it. Pursuing the same 
wise policy he established a trading post at Oswego in 1722 and 
fortified it in 1727, and thereby placed the Iroquois in the desir- 
able position of middlemen in a profitable fur trade with the 
" Far Indians." London merchants, in their greed, brought 
about the repeal of the prohibitory act in 1729, but its effects 
were only in part destroyed. At another intercolonial conference 
at Albany, called by Burnet, a line of trading posts along the 
northern and western frontiers was strongly recommended. 
But neither the other colonies nor the home government would 
co-operate, and the French were the first to accomplish it. In 
King George's War the co-operation of all the northern colonies 
was sought, and New York contributed £3000 and some cannon 
toward New England's successful expedition against Louisburg. 
But it was left alone to protect its own frontier against the French, 
and while the assembly was wrangling with Governor Clinton 
for the control of expenditures the French and their Indians were 
burning farm houses, attacking Saratoga (November 16, 1745)* 
and greatly endangering the English-Iroquois alliance. Even 
after the Peace of Aix-la-Chapelle (1748) the Iroquois complained 
bitterly of the fraudulent land speculators, and in 1753 the chiefs 
of the Mohawks threatened to declare the covenant chain 
broken. A reconciliation was effected, however, by Colonel 
William Johnson (171 5-1 774), who had long been superintendent 
of Indian affairs. Largely to secure the co-operation of the 
Iroquois the home government itself now called to meet at 
Albany (q.v.) the most important assembly of colonial deputies 
that had yet gathered. This body, consisting of twenty-five 
members and representing seven colonies, met in June 1754, 
and, besides negotiating successfully with the Iroquois, it adopted, 
with some modifications, a plan of colonial union prepared by 
Benjamin Franklin; the plan was not approved, however, either 
by the home government or by any of the colonies. In the first 
year of the war (1755) expeditions set out against Fort Duquesne 
(on the site of Pittsburg) and Fort Niagara and Crown Point, 
on the New York frontier. None of these was taken but on the 
8th of September Major-General William Johnson, in command 
of the expedition against Crown Point, defeated a French and 
Indian force under Baron Dieskau in the battle of Lake George. 
As Johnson thought it unsafe to pursue the routed army his 
victory had no other effect than the erection here of the useless 
defences of Fort William Henry, but as it was the only success 
in a year of gloom parliament rewarded him with a grant of 
£5000 and the title of a baronet. In August 1 7 56 Montcalm took 
Oswego from the English and destroyed it, and in 1757 he 
captured Fort William Henry; but in the latter year the elder 
Pitt assumed control of affairs in England, and his aggressive, 
clear-sighted policy turned the tide of war in England's favour. 
Victory followed victory, Ticonderoga, Crown Point and Niagara 
were wrested from the French and New York was freed of its 
foes. 

England's attempt to make the colonies pay the expenses 
of the war by means of the stamp tax thoroughly aroused the 
opposition of commercial New York, already chafing under the 
hardships imposed by the Navigation Acts and burdened with 
a war debt of its own exceeding £300,000. The assembly was 
almost unanimous in voicing its protest to the governor. It 
authorized its committee, which had been appointed to corre- 
spond with the New York agent in London, to correspond also 
with the committees in the other colonies and this committee 
represented New York in the Stamp Act Congress, a body which 
was called at the suggestion of Massachusetts, met in New 
York City in October 1765, was composed of twenty-seven 
members representing nine colonies, and drew up a declaration 
of rights, an address to the king, and a petition to each house 
of parliament. When the Sons of Liberty, a society composed 
largely of unfranchised mechanics and artisans of New York 
City, which began to dominate the movement immediately 
after the Congress adjourned, resorted to mob violence — destroy- 
ing property and burning in effigy the governor and other officers 
— the propertied classes drew back, and a few years later the 
popular or patriot party lost its control of the assembly. Since 
the Zenger trial there had been a court party a,nd a popular 
party: the former included many wealthy Anglicans and was 
under the leadership of the De Lanceys, the latter included 
many wealthy and influential dissenters and was under the 
leadership of the Livingstons. During the administration of 
Governor Clinton (1743-1753) a quarrel between the governor 
and James De Lancey, the chief- justice, had greatly weakened the 
court party, and nearly all its members supported their rivals 
in opposition to the Stamp Act. In the series of events which 
followed the first violence of the Sons of Liberty important 
changes were made in party lines. Personal rivalry and creed 
became subordinate to political principles. The court party 
became the Loyalist party, standing for law as against rebellion, 
monarchy and the union of the empire as against republicanism; 
the popular party became the patriot party, determined to stand 
on its rights at any cost. The Stamp Act was repealed in March 
1766, but the Townshend Acts, imposing duties on glass, paper, 
lead, painters' colours and tea, followed closely. They were met 
in New York by fresh outbursts of the Sons of Liberty and, 
as in the other colonies, by an association of nearly all the 
merchants, the members pledging themselves not to import any- 
thing from England until the duties were repealed. New York 
had also been requested to provide certain supplies for the British 
troops quartered in the city. This the assembly refused to do 
but parliament answered (1767) by forbidding it to do any other 
business until it complied. It was under these conditions that 
the Loyalists, in the elections of 1768 and 1769, gained control 
of the assembly and in the latter year passed an act granting 
the soldiers' supplies. When, in 1770, all the duties except 
those on tea were repealed, the conservative merchants wished 
to permit the importation of all goods from England except 
tea. The Sons of Liberty strongly opposed this, but the con- 
servatives won and went over to the Loyalists. The moderate 
Loyalists joined in the election of delegates to the first Con- 
tinental Congress; but the great body of Loyalists in New York 
strongly disapproved of the " dangerous and extravagant " 
measures adopted by that body, and the assembly, in January 
1775, refused to approve its acts or choose delegates to the 
second Continental Congress. The patriots met this refusal by 
calling a provincial convention to choose the delegates. Scarcely 
had they done this when news of. the encounter at Lexington 
produced a strong reaction in their favour, and in May 1775 they 
called a Provincial Congress which usurped the powers of the 
Assembly. Still, conditions were such in New York that a fight 
for independence was not to be lightly considered. The failure 
of Montgomery's expedition against Canada at the close of 1775 
left the colony exposed to British attacks from the north. In 
the south the chief city was exposed to the British fleet. Sir 
William Johnson died in 1774, but under his influence and that 
of his son, Sir John Johnson, and his nephew Guy Johnson, 
the Mohawks and other Iroquois Indians had become firmly 
attached to the British side and threatened the western frontier. 
In various sections, too, considerable numbers of Loyalists were 
determined to aid the British. When, in June 1776, a vote on 
the Declaration of Independence was pending in the Continental 
Congress, the New York Provincial Congress refused to instruct 
its delegates in the matter; but a newly elected Provincial 
Congress, influenced by a Loyalist plot against the life of Wash- 
ington, adopted the Declaration when it met, on the 9th of July. 
The position of New York made it naturally one of the principal 
theatres of military operations during the War of Independence. 
It was a settled point of British military policy throughout the 
war to hold New York City, and from it, as a base, to establish 
a line of fortified posts along the Hudson by means of which 
communication might be maintained with another base on 
Lake Champlain. Such a scheme, if successfully carried out, 
would have driven a wedge into the line of colonial defence and 
cut off communication between New England and the southern 
colonies. A few days after the fight at Lexington and Concord, 
Connecticut authorized an expedition under Ethan Allen which 
surprised and captured Ticonderoga and Crown Point. In the 
following year (1776) the British began their offensive opera- 
tions for the control of the Hudson; an army under Sir William 
Howe was to capture New York City and get controJ of the 
lower Hudson, while another army under Sir Guy Carleton was 
to retake Crown Point and Ticonderoga and get control of the 
upper Hudson. Howe, with a force of British and Loyalists 
vastly superior in equipment and numbers to Washington's 
untrained militia, landed in July on Staten Island and late in 
August defeated Washington at the battle of Long Island 
within the present limits of Brooklyn borough. In the following 
month Washington withdrew from New York City which the 
British entered and held until the close of the war. Washington 
prepared to withstand the British behind fortifications on 
Harlem Heights, but discovering that Howe was attempting 
to outflank him by landing troops in the rear he retreated to 
the mainland, leaving only a garrison at Fort Washington, and 
established a line of fortified camps on the hills overlooking 
the Bronx river as far as White Plains. This brought on the 
battle of White Plains late in October, in which Howe gained 
no advantage; and from here both armies withdrew into New 
Jersey, the British capturing Fort Washington on the way, the 
Americans leaving behind garrisons to guard the Highlands of 
the Hudson. In 1777 General John Burgoyne succeeded in 
taking Ticonderoga, but in the swampy forests southward from 
Lake Champlain he fought his way against heavy odds, and in 
the middle of October his campaign culminated disastrously 
in his surrender at Saratoga. Colonel Barry St Leger led an 
auxiliary expedition from Oswego against Fort Stanwix on the 
upper Mohawk, and on the 6th of August he fought at Oriskany 
one of the most bloody battles of the war, but a few days later, 
deserted by his terror-stricken Indian allies, he hastened back 
to Montreal. The British government intended that Howe 
should co-operate with Burgoyne by fighting his way up the 
Hudson, but as the secretary of state for the colonies neglected 
to send him such instructions this was not undertaken until 
early in October, and then an expedition for the purpose was 
placed under the command of Sir Henry Clinton. Clinton met 
with little difficulty from the principal American defences of 
the Highlands, consisting of Forts Montgomery and Clinton 
on the western bank, together with a huge chain and boom 
stretched across the river to a precipitous mountain (Anthony's 
Nose) on the opposite bank, and ascended as far as Esopus 
(now Kingston) which he burned, but he was too late to aid 
Burgoyne. The year 1778 saw the bloody operations of the 
Tory Butlers and their Loyalist and Indian allies in the Mohawk 
and Schoharie valleys and notably the massacre at Cherry 
Valley. In retaliation a punitive expedition under Generals 
John Sullivan and James Clinton in 1779 destroyed the Iroquois 
towns, and dealt the Indian confederacy a blow from which 
it never recovered. The American cause was strengthened this 
year also by several victories along the lower Hudson of which 
General Anthony Wayne's storming of the British fort at Stony 
Point was the most important. The closing episode of the war 
as far as New York was concerned was the discovery of Benedict 
Arnold's attempt in 1780 to betray West Point and other colonial 
posts on the Hudson to the British. On the 25th of November 
1783 the British forces finally evacuated New York City, but 
the British posts on Lakes Erie and Ontario were not evacuated 
until some years later. 

New York ratified the Articles of Confederation in 1778, and 
when Maryland refused to ratify unless those states asserting 
claims to territory west to the Mississippi agreed to surrender 
them, New York was the first to do so. But under the leadership 
of George Clinton, governor in i777~i795, the state jealously 
guarded its commercial interests. The Confederation Congress 
appealed to it in vain for the right to collect duties at its port; 
and there was determined opposition to the new Federal con- 
stitution. In support of the constitution, however, there arose 
the Federalist party under the able leadership of Alexander 
Hamilton. When a majority of the constitutional convention 
of 1787 had approved of the new constitution Hamilton alone 
of the three New York delegates remained to sign it; and when, 
after its ratification by eight states, the New York convention 
met at Poughkeepsie (June 17, 1788) to consider ratification, 
two-thirds of the members were opposed to it. But others 
were won over by the news that it had been ratified by New 
Hampshire and Virginia or by the telling arguments of Hamilton, 
and on the 26th of July the motion to ratify was carried by a 
vote of 30 to 27. 

The constitution having been ratified, personal rivalry among 
the great families — the Clintons, the Livingstons and the 
Schuylers — again became dominant in political affairs. The 
Clintons were most popular among the independent freeholders; 
the Livingstons had increased their influence by numerous 
marriage alliances with landed families; and the Schuylers 
had General Philip Schuyler and Alexander Hamilton, his 
son-in-law. Originally, the Livingstons, with whom John Jay 
was connected by marriage, were united with the Schuylers, 
and yet both together were unable to defeat the Clintons in an 
election for governor. Later, the Livingstons, piqued at Wash- 
ington's neglect to give them the offices they thought their due, 
joined the Clintons, but the Federal patronage was used against 
the anti-Federalists or Republicans with such effect that in 
1792 John Jay received more votes for governor than George 
Clinton, although the latter was counted in on a technicality. 
Jay was elected in 1795 and re-elected in 1798, but in 1801 the 
brief Federalist regime in the state came to an end with the 
election of George Clinton for a seventh term. The Republican 
leaders straightway quarrelled among themselves, thus starting 
the long series of factional strifes which have characterized the 
party politics of New York state; the bitterness of the factions 
and the irresponsible council of appointment are also responsible 
for the firm establishment early in the Republican regime of 
the " spoils system." The leaders of the several Republican 
groups were Chancellor Robert R. Livingston, Aaron Burr, then 
vice-president, Governor George Clinton and his nephew, De 
Witt Clinton, who in 1802 was elected United States senator. 
The first break came in the spring of 1804 when Burr, who had 
incurred the enmity of his Republican colleagues in 1800 by 
seeking Federalist votes in the electoral college at Jefferson's 
expense, became an independent candidate for governor against 
Morgan Lewis. Hamilton's action in counselling Federalists 
not to vote for Burr for governor just as he had counselled them 
not to support Burr against Jefferson in 1800, was one of the 
contributary causes of Burr's hostility to Hamilton which ended 
in the duel (July 1804) in which Burr killed Hamilton. Hamil- 
ton's death marked the end of the Federalists as a power in New 
York. The election as governor in 1804 of Lewis, a relative of 
the Livingstons, was followed by a bitter quarrel with the 
Clintons over patronage, and resulted at the state election of 
1807 in the choice of a Clintonian, Daniel D. Tompkins, for 
governor and the virtual elimination of the Livingstons from 
New York state politics. Tompkins served as governor by 
successive re-elections until 1817, his term covering the trying 
period of the second war with Great Britain. New York, whose 
growing shipping interests had suffered by the Embargo of 
1807, was as a commercial state opposed to the war. Politically 
this opposition had the effect of temporarily reviving the 
Federalist party, which secured control of the legislature, and 
gave the electoral vote of the state in 181 2 to De Witt Clinton, 
whom the Federalists had accepted as a candidate to oppose 
Madison for re-election on the war issue. During the war New 
Yorkers served with the regular troops at Niagara, Plattsburg 
and other places on the western and northern frontiers of the 
state. For some years after the war political contests in New 
York state as in the rest of the country were not on party lines. 
The opposing groups were known as " Bucktails," whose leaders 
were Governor Tompkins and Martin Van Buren, and " Clin- 
tonians " or supporters of De Witt Clinton. In 18 17 an act was 
passed which ten years later ended for ever slavery in New York 
state; in the same year De Witt Clinton was elected governor 
and, largely through his efforts, the Erie Canal was begun. 

The election of Martin Van Buren as governor in 1828 marked 
the beginning of the long ascendancy in the state of the " Albany 
Regency," a political coterie in which Van Buren, W. L. Marcy, 
Benjamin Franklin Butler (1 795-1858) and Silas Wright were 
among the leaders; Thurlow Weed, their bitterest opponent 
and the man who gave them their name, declared of them that 
he " had never known a body of men who possessed so much 
power and used it so well." Thurlow Weed owed his early 
political advancement to the introduction into state politics of 
the anti-Masonic issue (see Anti-Masonic Party), which also 
brought into prominence his co-worker W. H. Seward. In 1826 in 
Genesee county the disappearance of a printer named William 
Morgan was attributed to Free-Masons and aroused a strong 
antipathy to that order; and the anti-Masonic movement, 
through the fostering care of Weed, Francis Granger (1792-1868) 
and others, spread to other states and led eventually to the 
estabh'shment of a political organization that by uniting various 
anti-Jacksonian elements, polled in the New York state election 
of 1832 more than 156,000 votes for Francis Granger, their 
candidate for governor against Marcy, who was chosen by about 
10,000 plurality. As the anti-Masonic wave subsided its leaders 
and most of its adherents found a place in the newly organized 
Whig party, which was powerful enough in New York to elect 
William H. Seward governor in 1838, and to re-elect him and 
to carry the state for W. H. Harrison against Van Buren in 1840. 
It was during the first administration of Governor Seward that 
the anti-rent agitation in the Hudson river counties began. 
The greater part of the land in this section was comprised in 
vast estates such as Rensselaerwyck, Livingston, Scarsdale, 
Phillipse, Pelham and Van Cortlandt manors, and on these 
the leasehold system with perpetual leases, leases for 99 years or 
leases for one to three lives had become general. Besides rent, 
many of the tenants were required to render certain services to 
the proprietor, and in case a tenant sold his interest in a farm 
to another he was required to pay the proprietor one-tenth to 
one-third of the amount received as an alienation fine. Stephen 
van Rensselaer, the proprietor of Rensselaerwyck, had suffered 
the rents, especially those of his poorer tenants, to fall much 
in arrears, and when after his death (1839) the agents of his 
heirs attempted to collect them they encountered violent 
opposition. Governor Seward called out the militia to preserve 
order but asked the legislature to consider the tenants' grievances. 
The legislature appointed an arbitration commission, but this 
was unsuccessful, and the trouble, spreading to other counties, 
culminated ( 1 845) in the murder of the deputy-sheriff of Delaware 
county. Politically, the anti-rent associations which were 
formed often held the balance of power between the Whigs and 
the Democrats, and in this position they secured the election of 
Governor John Young (Whig) as well as of several members of the 
legislature favourable to their cause, and promoted the passage of 
the bill calling the constitutional convention of 1846. In the new 
constitution clauses were inserted abolishing feudal tenures 
and limiting future leases of agricultural land to a period of 
twelve years. The courts pronounced the alienation fines illegal. 
The legislature passed several measures for the destruction of the 
leasehold system, and under the pressure of public opinion the 
great landlords rapidly sold their farms. 1 Up to the election cf 
Seward as governor, New York had usually been Democratic, 
largely through the predominating influence of Van Buren and 
the " Albany Regency." After the defeat of Governor Silas 
Wright in 1846, however, the Democratic party split into two 
hostile factions known as the " Hunkers," or conservatives, and 
the " Barnburners," or radicals. The factions had their origin 
in canal politics, the conservatives advocating the use of canal 
revenues to complete the canals, the radicals insisting that they 
should be used to pay the state debt. Later when the con- 
servatives accepted the annexation of Texas and the radicals 
supported the Wilmot Proviso ihe split became* irrevocable. 
The split broke up the rule of the " regency," Marcy accepting the 
" Hunker " support and a seat in Polk's cabinet, while Wright, 
Butler and Van Buren joined the " Barnburners," a step pre- 
liminary to Van Buren's acceptance of the " Free Soil " nomina- 
tion for president in the campaign of 1848. Only once between 
1846 and the Civil War did the Democratic party regain control 
of the state — in 1853-1855 Horatio Seymour was governor for 
a single term. In 1854 the newly organized Republican party, 
formed largely from the remnants of the Whig party and including 
most of the Free Soil Democrats, with the aid of the temperance 
issue elected Myron Holley Clark (1806-189 2) governor. Two 
years later the Republicans carried the state for Fremont for 
president, and a succession of Republican governors held office 
until 1862 when the discouragement in the North with respect to 
the Civil War brought a reaction which elected Seymour governor. 
With the exception of New York City the state was loyal to the 
Union cause during the war and furnished over a half million 
troops to the Federal armies. Certain commercial interests of New 
York City favoured the Confederate cause, but MayorWood's sug- 
gestion that the city (with Long Island and Staten Island) secede 
and form a free-city received scant support, and after the san-

	bearer (1845) and The Redskins (1846) preach the anti-rent doctrine.

guinary draft riots of July 1863 (see New York City) no further 
difficulty was experienced. After the Civil War the state began 
to reassume the pivotal position in national politics which has 
always made its elections second only in interest and importance 
to those of the nation, and the high political tension emphasized 
the evils of the " spoils system." In 1868 Tammany Hall (q.v.), 
then under the rule of William M. Tweed, forced the Democratic 
state convention to nominate its henchman, John T. Hoffman, 
for governor, and by the issue of false naturalization papers 
and fraudulent voting in New York City on a gigantic scale 
Hoffman was chosen governor and the electoral vote was cast 
for Seymour. Tammany and Hoffman were again victorious 
in 187c; but in 1871 the New York Times disclosed the magni- 
tude of Tammany's thefts, amounting in the erection of the 
New York county court house alone to almost $8,000,000, 
and Tweed and his " Ring " were crushed in consequence. The 
Republicans carried the state in 1872, but in 1874 Samuel J. 
Tilden, a Democrat and the leading prosecutor of Tweed, was 
elected governor. The Republican legislature had in 1867 
appointed a committee to investigate the management of the 
canal system, but the abuses were allowed to continue until 
in 1875 Governor Tilden disclosed many frauds of the " Canal 
Ring," and punished the guilty. In 1876, Tilden having been 
nominated for the presidency, New York cast its electoral vote 
for him. In 1 880 it was cast for Garfield, the Republican nominee. 
Two years later the Republicans, having split over a struggle for 
patronage into the two factions known as " Stalwarts " or 
administrative party and " Halfbreeds " of whom the leader 
was Roscoe Conkling, were defeated, Grover Cleveland being 
chosen governor. In 1884 Cleveland as the Democratic pre- 
sidential nominee received the electoral vote of his state. Cleve- 
land likewise carried the state in 1892, but in 1888 Benjamin 
Harrison, the Republican candidate, the factional quarrels 
being settled, carried the state. Hostility to free silver and 
" Bryanism " in the large financial and industrial centres put the 
state strongly in the Republican column in the elections of 1896, 
1900, 1904 and 1908. It was carried by the Democrats in the 
gubernatorial campaign of 1910.

Discovery to 1762 (1st part, 1757, reprinted in the 1st series of 
the New York Historical Society Collections, 2 vols., 1 829-1 830) is 
still the chief authority for the period from the English Revolution of 
1688 to the eve of the War of Independence. For the same period, 
however, consult C. W. Spencer, Phnses of Royal Government in 
New York, 16Q1-1719 (Columbus, 1905). John Fiske, The Dutch and 
Quaker Colonies in America (2 vols., Boston, 1900) is admirable in 
its generalizations but unreliable in its details. G. W. Schuyler, 
Colonial New York: Philip Schuyler and his Family (2 vols., New 
York, 1885) is a family history, but especially valuable in the study of 
Indian affairs and the intermarriages of the landed families. A. C. 
Flick's Loyalism in New York during the American Revolution (New 
York, 1901) and H. P. Johnston's Campaign of 1776 around New 
York and Brooklyn (Brooklyn, 1878) are thorough studies. For the

NEW YORK (CITY), the largest city of New York state, U.S.A., 
situated at the junction of the Hudson river, here called the North 
river, with the narrow East river (actually a strait connecting 
Long Island Sound with the Upper Bay), and between Long 
Island Sound and the Atlantic Ocean. It is composed of five 
boroughs: the Borough of the Bronx on the south-easternmost 
part of the mainland of New York state; the Borough of Man- 
hattan on Manhattan Island (including also other small islands 1 ) 
immediately S. and S.W. of the Bronx, and bounded on the 
W. by the North river, on the E. by the East river, and on the 
S. by New York Bay; the Borough of Richmond (Staten 
Island, q-v.), the southernmost and westernmost part of the city; 
and on the western end of Long Island, the Borough of Brooklyn 
(q.v.) f and, N. of it, the Borough of Queens. The city hall, in 
the southern part of Manhattan Island, is in lat. 40 42' 43* N. 
and long. 74 o' 3* W. The greatest width of the city E. and 
W. is 16 m., and the greatest length N. and S. is 32 m.; its 
area is about 326-97 sq. m. (285-72 sq. m. more than in 1890), 
of which Manhattan Borough constitutes nearly 21-93 sq. m., 
the Borough of the Bronx about 41-7 sq. m., the Borough of 
Queens about 1 29-5 sq. m., the Borough of Brooklyn 77-6 sq. m., 
and the Borough of Richmond 55-2 sq. m. 2 The total waterfront 
of the city is 341-22 m., and much of it, especially on the lower 
part of Manhattan, is made ground. 

New York harbour is one of the most beautiful, largest and 
best of the world's great ports. Over the bar (Sandy Hook), 
about 20 m. S. of the S, end of Manhattan Island, is the " Main 
Ship Bayside-Gedney channel," 1000 ft. wide and 30 ft. deep! 
By 1909 the Federal government had completed 7 J m. of 
the Ambrose channel farther to the E. and 40 ft. deep, and 
950-1600 ft. wide (2200 ft. is the projected width). 3 A third 

	1 The more important of these small islands are: Blackwell's 
	(about 120 acres) in the East river, Ward's N. of Blackwell's, and 
	Randall's N. of Ward's, separated from it by Little Hell Gate, and 
	in the mouth of the Harlem river; in the Upper Bay, Governor's 
	Island (originally 65 acres; enlarged by the addition of 101 acres 
	to the southwest), a U.S. military reservation, about 1000 yds. S. of 
	the Battery, the southernmost point of Manhattan Island; Bedloe's 
	Island (sometimes called Liberty Island from the Bartholdi 
	statue on it of " Liberty Enlightening the World "), with an area of 
	13J acres, lying 2 m. S.W. of the Battery; and Ellis Island, ii m. 
	W.S.W. of the Battery, occupied by the Federal government as a 
	landing-place for immigrants. In the Lower Bay, and a part of the 
	Borough of Richmond, are the artificial islands, Swinburne (1866- 
	1870; 8 m. S. of the Battery) and Hoffman (1868-1873; 7 m. S. of 
	the Battery), constructed for quarantine stations. 

	2 Manhattan and Bronx boroughs compose New York county; the 
	counties of Queens and Richmond are coterminous respectively with 
	the boroughs of those names; Brooklyn Borough is coextensive with 
	Kings county. 

	3 The narrowness of the channel makes the tidal scour more 
	effective, and it was little filled in even when sewage and garbage was 
	dumped in the Bay itself. The river carries little silt and leaves most 
	of it well above the harbour. The natural excellence of the harbour 
	may be inferred from the following figures: in 1895-1903 the Federal

	1. Custom House 
	2. Post Office

channel, the South and Swash, is used by coasting vessels drawing 
about 20 ft. The harbour is divided into three parts: the 
Lower Bay, the Upper Bay and the North and East rivers. 
The Lower Bay (about 88 sq. m.) of which Raritan Bay on the 
S.W., Sandy Hook Bay on the S.E., and Gravesend Bay on" 
the N.E. form parts, and to which the channels mentioned afford 
entrance from the ocean, has Staten Island to the W. and N., 
Brooklyn to the N. and E., and the New Jersey shore to the 
S. and W. The Upper Bay has an area of 14 sq. m., is the 
immediate embouchure of the North and the East river, is 
connected with the Lower Bay by the Narrows (minimum 
width 1 m.) and with Newark Bay to the W. by Kill Van Kull, 
immediately N. of Staten Island, and, except for these four 
narrow water-ways, is euclosed by land. The North river 
(maximum depth, 60 ft.) is here about' 1 m. wide and the East 
river (maximum depth more than 100 ft.; in Hell Gate channel 
about 200 ft.) is about f m. wide and, from the Battery to 
Throg's Neck and Willett's Point, where Long Island Sound 
proper begins, about 20 m. long. The north-east entrance 
to the harbour, from Long Island Sound by the East river, 
used principally by New England coasting vessels (especially 
coal barges), was made navigable for vessels of 25-27 ft. draft 
by the Federal government, which in 1870-1876 and in 1885 
widened and deepened the formerly dangerous narrows and 
removed the reefs of Hell Gate, between Manhattan Island 
(E. 88th Street), Blackwell's Island, Astoria (on the Long 
Island shore), and Ward's Island. The third great entry and 
commercial feeder to the harbour is the North river, by which 
the great inland water-borne traffic of the-Hudson river and the 
Erie Canal is brought to the port of New York. On the North 
river are the piers of the transatlantic steamship companies, 
part of them on the New Jersey side at Hoboken (q.v.). The 
coastwise trade with New England, especially through Long 
Island Sound, is largely from the East river, to which a part 
of the Hudson river traffic makes its way by the Harlem river. 
The Harlem is a place of anchorage for small craft. 

The narrow approaches to the harbour from the ocean and from 
Long Island Sound make its fortification easy. On Sandy Hook, 
less than 8 m. from the nearest points of Rockaway Beach and Coney 
Island on the other side of the entrance, is Fort Hancock, established 
as a military reservation (1366 acres) in 1892; it received its present 
name in 1895, and has an artillery garrison. Between the lower 
and upper bays, on the Narrows, are Fort Wadsworth (1827; named 
in honour of General James S. Wadsworth (1 807-1 864), killed in the 
battle of the Wilderness), on the Staten Island side, a reservation of 
230 acres, including Fort Tompkins, on higher ground than Fort 
Wadsworth proper, and, across the Narrows, on the Long Island 
shore, Fort Hamilton (1831), with a reservation of 167 acres. 
Older fortifications are Fort Lafayette (1807; called Fort Diamond 
until 1823), between Forts Hamilton and Wadsworth on an artificial 
island, now used to store ordnance and supplies, and Fort Columbus 
(1806), South Battery (1812) and Castle Williams (built in 181 1 by 
Jonathan Williams (1 750-1 81 5), who planned^ all the earlier forti- 
fications of New York harbour; it is now a military prison), all on 
Governor's Island, where are important barracks and the New York 
arsenal of the Ordnance Department. The- north-eastern approach 
to the harbour, at the entrance to Long Island Sound, is protected 
by fortifications, Fort Totten, at Willett's Point (1862), and 
directly across from this battery by Fort Schuyler (1826; 
post established 1856) with a reservation of 52 acres on Throg's 
Neck. 

Geology. — Manhattan Island 1 (i^i m. long; maximum width — 
at 14th Street — 2\ m.; average width about 2 m.) is a "group of 
gneissoid islands separated ... by low levels slightly elevated above 
tide and filled with drift and alluvium " (L. D. Gale in W. W. Mather's 
Geology of New York, 1843), with a steep west wall from Manhattan- 
ville (125th Street W. of 8th Avenue) S. beyond 81st Street, and a 
much steeper east wall. Upon its first occupation by the Dutch the 
island was rough and rocky with brooks, ponds, marshes and several 
expenses for important harbour improvements, principally dredging, 
were $1,035,300 for New York, $2,710,000 (exclusive of $1,185,000 
for the Delaware Breakwater) for Philadelphia, $1,501,169 for 
Boston, $1,404,845 for New Orleans, and $470,000 for Baltimore.

	New York (Washington, 1905), Bulletin 270 of the U.S. Geological 
	Survey, with an excellent summary of the earlier literature. The 
	study of the underlying rock of Manhattan Island and its vicinity 
	has been stimulatedby the great engineering and building enter- 
	prises in the city limits. 

swamps. 1 Superficially the island may be divided into: an area of 
drift, S. of 21st Street on the East river, of 13th street on Broadway 
and of 31st Street on the North river; a second, narrow area of 
drift running from Hell Gate N.W.to Manhattanville in a line parallel 
to the Harlem; a limestone (Inwood limestone) area on the Harlem 
from its mouth to the sharp turn in its course ; a second and smaller 
limestone area on the Spuyten Duyvil in the north-westernmost part 
of the island; and the remainder areas of gneiss, the larger part being 
in two great " islands,' 1 one between the line of E. 21st Street, 13th • 
Street and W. 31st Street, already mentioned, and a line from Hell 
Gate to Manhattanville, and the other nearly joining the first at 
Manhattanville and covering all the narrow N.W. part of Manhattan 
Island except the second limestone area on the Spuyten Duyvil. 
These two gneiss areas have a southerly tilt; they are named re- 
spectively Washington and Morningside Heights. In all these areas, 
except the limestone, the underlying rock is what is styled Man- 
hattan schist (see U.S. Geologic Atlas, N.Y. City, folio No. 83). The 
waterfront of Manhattan does not correspond in direction with lime- 
stone belts, but is probably due to lines of fracture (see W. H. Hobbs, 
in Bulletin, Geological Society^ of America, xvi. 151-182). 

The Borough of the Bronx is made of high N.E. and S.W. ridges, 
sloping E. to the lower shores of Long Island Sound; and the 
Boroughs of Brooklyn and Queens form part of the great terminal 
moraine. Low serpentine nills (300-380 ft.), with a N.E. and 
S.W. trend, occupy the central part of the northern end of Staten 
Island; W. of this is Jura-Trias formation, crossed in its centre by a 
narrow strip of igneous dike rock; the E. and S. part of the island is 
Cretaceous. Yellow gravel is one of the many evidences of glacial 
drift ; but the S.E. part of the island was not encroached upon by the 
moraine. 

Climate. — A combination of marine and continental influences 
produces a humid climate subject to sudden changes of temperature. 
The temperature, however, rises above 90 F. only six days in a year 
on the average ; it rarely falls below zero ; and in a period of thirty- 
eight years, from 1871 to 1908, extremes ranged between 100 , in 
September 1881, and -6°, in February 1899. The mean winter 
temperature (December, January and February) is 32 °; the mean 
summer temperature (June, July and August) is 72 ; and the mean 
annual temperature is 52 . The average monthly rainfall ranges 
from 3*2 in. in May to 4*5 in. in July and in August, and the mean 
annual precipitation is^ 44*8 in. The average annual^ fall of snow 
amounts to 37 in., of which 11*5 in. falls in February, 8*7 in. in January 
and 8-2 in. in March. The average^ number of hours ofsunshine 
ranges from 150 in November to 271 in June. The prevailing winds 
are N.W., except in June when they are S.W. 

Streets. — In the downtown portion of Manhattan Island, a strip 
about 2 m. long, some streets follow the irregular water-fronts 
and others cross these; and on the west side this irregularity 
extends farther N., in the former Greenwich village (W. and 
N.W. of Washington Square), where West 4th Street, running 
N.W., crosses West 12th Street, running S.W. north of Houston 
Street, then North Street, the northernmost limit of the occupied 
city; in 1807 a commission laid out the island into streets, which 
were numbered from S. to N. and were called East and West, as 
they were E. or W. of Broadway, below 8th Street, and of Fifth 
Avenue, above 8th, and into avenues, which were numbered s from 
E. to W,, Twelfth Avenue being on the North river waterfront. 
East of First Avenue in a bulge of the Island S. of 23rd Street 
four additional avenues were named A, B, C, and D, Avenue 
A being one block E. of First Avenue. Afterwards Madison 
Avenue was laid out midway between Fourth and Fifth Avenues, 
N. from 23rd Street, and Lexington Avenue, midway between 
Third and Fourth Avenues, N. from 21st Street. The most 
important of the avenues is Broadway, an unfortunately narrow 
street in the busy downtown part of its course. From Bowling 
Green, immediately N. of the Battery, it goes in a straight line 
(E. of N.) for about 2\ m. to 10th Street; then bears off to 
the W. It is called the Boulevard from 78th Street to 162nd 
Street in its course between Amsterdam Avenue and West 
End (or Eleventh) Avenue (to 104th Street), and then as a 
continuation of West End Avenue; and thence to the Yonkers 
city line is called Kingsbridge Road. The monotonous regularity 
of the rectangular street plan of Manhattan above 14th Street 
is partly redeemed by this westward trend of Broadway, the only

	Manhattan, by George Everett Hill and George E. Waring, Jr., in 
	Historic New York: the First Series of the Half Moon Papers (New 
	York, 1899). 

	1 In the Borough of the Bronx the system of numbered avenues 
	no longer holds, but the cross streets are numbered consecutively, 
	W. 262nd Street being immediately S. of the Yonkers line and E. 
	242nd and 243rd immediately S. of the Mt. Vernon boundary. 

old street in this part of the city. The Bowery, extending 
N. from Chatham Square to East 4th St. (practically con- 
tinued by Fourth Avenue), is not now a street of commercial 
importance, being largely taken up with Yiddish tenements'. 
Broadway, in its southernmost part, is a financial and business 
street; the financial interests centre particularly about Wall 
Street, 1 which is about one-third of a mile above the Battery, 
runs E. from Broadway, and was named from a redoubt built 
here by the Dutch in 1653 on news of a threatened attack 
by the English. The wholesale dry goods district is on 
Broadway and the side streets between Reade and Prince Streets 
and the wholesale grocery district immediately W. of this. In 
Maiden Lane is the wholesale jewelry trade. The leather and 
hide trade is centred immediately S. of the approaches to the 
Brooklyn Bridge. A little farther up-town on the East Side is 
the tenement district, one of the most crowded in the world. 
The principal shopping districts are on Broadway from 17th 
Street to 34th Street; on Sixth Avenue from 14th Street to 
34th Street; and to an increasing degree on Fifth Avenue 
from 23rd Street to 42nd Street, and on the cross-streets in this 
area, especially 23rd, 34th and 42nd Streets. Next to Broadway 
■ the best known of the avenues is Fifth Avenue, which extends 
from Washington Square to the Harlem river (143rd Street) in a 
straight line. On Fifth Avenue there are a few residences in its 
lower part and between 34th and 45th Streets; but N. of 50th 
and on the E. side of Central Park are many fine residences. 
The cross streets within one block to the W. and two blocks 
to the E. of Fifth Avenue, Central Park West, and in general 
the upper West Side and in particular Riverside Drive, high above 
the North river, are the newer residential parts of the city. 

Parks. — The park system in 1908 included property valued at 
$501,604,188. The principal parks are: Central Park in Man- 
hattan; Prospect Park in Brooklyn ($.v.); and Bronx Park, Van 
Cortlandt Park and Pclham Bay Park in the Bronx. The first park 
(as distinguished from " square ") of any size in Manhattan was 
Central Park (840 acres; between 59th and 110th Streets and 
between 5th and 8th Avenues; about 2 J m. long and £ m. wide), 
which was laid out (beginning in 1857) by F. L. Olmsted and Calvert 
Vaux. Nearly one-half is wooded, with a variety of native and 
foreign trees and shrubs. The park contains a large pond, the Mere, 
in the N.E. corner; the Croton retaining reservoir and the receiving 
reservoir, and other sheets of water. Near the 65th Street entrance 
from 5th Avenue is the Arsenal, the executive quarters of the De- 
partment of Parks, with a meteorological observatory (1869): 

Pelham Bay Park (1756 acres), in the north-easternmost corner of 
thecity, lies on Long Island Sound, includes Hunter's Island and 
Twin Islands, and has a total shore front of about 9 m. Bordering 
on the city of Yonkers, S. (from 262nd Street) to 242nd Street, is 
Van Cortlandt Park (1132 acres), in which are the Van Cortlandt 
Mansion (1748), for a time Washington's headquarters and now a 
Revolutionary Museum under the Colonial Dames, a parade-ground 
(75 acres), and Van Cortlandt Lake, a skating pond. East of Van 
Cortlandt Park is Woodlawn Cemetery. Mosnolu Parkway (600 ft. 
wide and about 6000 ft. long) leads from Van Cortlandt Park to the 
S.E., and Bronx and Pelham Parkway (400 ft. wide and 12,000 ft. 
long) from Pelham Bay Park to the S.W. connecting these parks with 
Bronx Park (719 acres) on either side of the Bronx river, a small 
stream which here broadens into lakes and ponds and has a fall at 
the lower end of the park. Bronx Park reaches from 180th Street to 
205th Street. The northern part is occupied by the New York 
Botanical Gardens and the southern part by the Zoological Park. 

Battery Park is at the southern end of Manhattan ; here are the 
New York Aquarium (in what was until 1896 Castle Garden, on the 
site of Fort Clinton) and a children's playground (1903). In City 
Hall Park are the public buildings mentioned below. 

The other down-town open spaces are small; many of them are 
recreation grounds, some, such as Mulberry Bend Park and Hamilton 
Fish Park, being on the site of former slums, condemned by the city 
at great expense. Especially in this part of the city municipal 
recreation piers and free baths have been constructed. Washington 
Square (1827), between Waverley Place, Wooster and Macdougal 
Streets, at the foot of 5th Avenue, became a pauper burial-ground 
about 1797, and waslaid out as a park in 1827; on the N. side of the 
square there are still a few fine old residences. Union Square, 
between Broadway and 4th Avenue, is a favourite place for work- 
men's mass meetings. Madison Square is reclaimed swampy ground 
on which there was an arsenal in 1806-1815, then a parade-ground, 
and in 1 825-1839 a municipal House of Refuge in the old barracks, 
and which was then laid out as a park and was a fashionable centre in 
1850-1875. Bryant Park on Sixth Avenue, between 40th and 42nd 
Streets, was a Potter's Field in 1813-1823, and in 1853 was the site of 

	1 See F. T. Hill, Story of a Street (New York, 1908). 

a world's fair with Crystal Palace, which was destroyed in 1858. In 
De Witt Clinton Park between 52nd and 54th Streets on the North 
river, there was the first children's farm school 1 in New York. 
Riverside Park (140 acres ^1872), between 72nd and 129th Streets, 
on the North river front, is a finely wooded natural terrace with 
winding paths. Morningside Park (31 j acres), between W. 110th 
and 123rd Streets, beautifully wooded, and Mount Morris Park 
(20 J acres) from 120th to 124th Streets, interrupting Fifth Avenue, 
are high rough ground, Mount Morris being the highest point on 
Manhattan Island. 

Among the other parks in the north part of Manhattan Island are : 
Roger Morris Park, between 160th and 162nd Streets, containing the 
Roger Morris or Jumel Mansion (1763), Washington's headquarters 
for five weeks in 1776, then the headquarters of Sir Henry Clinton, 
and after 1777 of the Hessian officers; High Bridge Park (73^ acres) 
at the Manhattan end of High Bridge, between W. 170th and 175th 
Streets; Audubon Park between 155th and 158th Streets, from 
Broadway to the North river, the home in 1 840-1 851 of John James 
Audubon; and Ft. Washington (403 acres) from 171st to 183rd 
Streets on the North river, the site of Ft. Washington in the War of 
Independence. Along the W. bank of the Harlem river for about 
3 m. N. and N.W. is the Harlem River Driveway (or speedway), 
about 95 ft. wide. Besides the large parks in the Bronx the more 
important are Crotona (154-6 acres), and Poe Park (2 J acres) on E. 
192nd Street, the site of E. A. Poe's Fordham cottage. The great 
baseball grounds of the National and American leagues furnish 
amusement to the crowds interested in professional baseball. Coney 
Island (q.v.) f similar resorts on Staten Island, on the shores of the 
North river and on Long Island on the Sound, and on the Hudson 
river are popular amusement places. 

Buildings. — The city's sky-line is broken by the tall business 
buildings, known as " sky-scrapers," 8 the construction of which 
was made necessary by the narrowness of the down-town portion 
of the island in which the increasing business population had 
to be accommodated. The ten-storey Tower Building (1889; 
21 ft. wide; first 9 then 11 storeys; replaced in 1908-19 10 by 
a taller and wider building) was the first of these, and was soon 
followed by much taller ones. 

The prominent business buildings include the Singer Sewing- 
Machine Company's Building 4 (612 ft. high, built in 1905-1908 
by Ernest Flagg); the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company's 
Building (693 ft.; completed in 1909); the Produce Exchange 
(with a 2 2 5-f t. tower) ; the Manhattan Life Building (with a 360-f t. 
tower); the Empire Building (20 storeys); on Wall Street, the 
Drexel Building, the Trust Company of America (23 storeys), 
and the National City Bank; on Broad Street, the white marble 
Stock Exchange (1903), the Broad Exchange Building (276 ft. 
high), and the Commercial Cable Building (317 ft. high) ; in Cedar 
Street, the New York Clearing House; in Liberty Street, the 
New York Chamber of Commerce (1903), built of white marble 
and granite, with Ionic columns, the Trinity Building (with a 
Gothic facade) and the United States Realty Building (both by 
F. H. Kimball), the City Investing Building (32 storeys; 
486 ft. high); in Church Street, the Hudson Terminal Buildings 
(1909, Clinton & Russell), 22 storeys high, with four storeys below 
ground (including the terminal of the down-town Hudson tunnels), 
office buildings with a tenant population' of 10,000; in Park 
Row, the Park Row Building (30 storeys; 390 ft. high), and 
the office building of the World (the Pulitzer Building, with a 
dome 310 ft. high); the white marble Home Life Insurance 
Building with its sloping red tiled roof; the Fuller (or " Flatiron ") 
Building (290 ft. high); and the New York Times Building (363 
ft. high) at 42nd Street and Broadway. 

The principal public buildings are: the. Custom House (1902- 
1907; by Cass Gilbert), on the site of Fort Amsterdam, built of 
granite in the French Renaissance style; in Wall Street, the 
United States Sub-Treasury, on the site of Federal Hall, in 
which George Washington was inaugurated first president of 
the United States; and in and about City Hall Park, the Post

Office, the Italian Renaissance City Hall by John McComb, Jr., 
1803-181 2 (architecturally the best of the public buildings); the 
Court House, the Hali of Records (French Renaissance), and a 
new Municipal Building with a lantern 559 ft. high, the main 
building of 23 storeys being pierced by an arcade through which 
Chambers Street runs; a little farther N. and E. of Broadway, 
the Tombs (1 898-1 899), the city prison, connected by a flying 
bridge called " the Bridge of Sighs " with the Criminal Courts; 
at Madison Avenue and 25th Street, the elaborate Appellate 
Court House (J. B. Lord); and on Fifth Avenue (4oth-42nd Sts.) 
the new Public Library (1 91 1). There are several large armouries 
of the state militia in the city, the best known being those of 
the 7th, 69th and 71st regiments. 

Churches. — Historically the foremost religious denomination in 
New York City is the Dutch Reformed. The consistory of the 
Collegiate Church, controlling several churches, is the oldest ecclesi- 
astical organization in the city, dating from 1628, when there was a 
Dutch church " in the Fort." After the city passed into the hands 
of the English the Protestant Episcopal Church rapidly increased in 
power, and in 1705 received the grant of the " Queen's Farm " 
between Christopher and Vesey streets. This immense wealth is 
held by the corporation of Trinity Church. Its present building 
(1 839-1 846; by R. M. Upjohn) is on the site of a church built in 
1696, at the head of Wall Street on Broadway. The bronze doors are 
a memorial to J. J. Astor, and* the altar and reredos, to W. B. Astor. 
In the churchyard are the graves of Alexander Hamilton, Robert 
Fulton, Captain James Lawrence, Albert Gallatin, William Bradford, 
the colonial printer, and General Phil Kearny. Many of the largest 
Episcopalian churches in the city were founded as its chapels, in- 
cluding St Paul's (1766), the oldest church building in the city. 
Trinity has several important chapels dependent on it. The Presby- 
terian Church is relatively stronger in New York than in any other 
city in the country with the possible exceptions of Philadelphia and 
Pittsburg. The first Methodist Episcopal society in the United 
States was formed in New York in 1766 and still exists as the John 
Street Church. The varied immigration to the city had brought in 
the other Protestant sects; the large Irish immigration of the first 
two-thirds of the 19th century, and the great Hebrew migration of the 
last part of the same century, made the Roman Catholic and the 
Jewish denominations strong. The city became the see of a Roman 
Catholic bishop in 1808 and of an archbishop in 1850. The Roman 
Catholic Cathedral, St Patrick's (50th-5ist Streets; Fifth-Madison 
Avenues), is the head of the archdiocese of New York ;it is the largest 
and one of the most elaborately decorated churches in the country, 
designed by James Renwick and erected in 1850-1879, with a Lady 
Chapel added in 1903. It is in Decorated style and is built princip- 
ally of white marble. _ Behind the Cathedral on Madison Avenue is 
the archiepiscopal residence. The Protestant Episcopal Cathedral 
of St John the Divine, on 112th Street near Morningside Park, was 
begun in 1892; the crypt and St Saviour's Chapel werecompleted 
inigio. Other prominent Episcopalian churches are: Christ Church, 
organized in 1794, the second parish in age to Trinity; St Mark's, an 
old parish with a colonial church (1829); Grace Church (organized 
in 1808), since 1844 in a commanding position at Broadway and 
10th Street, at the first turn in Broadway, with a building of white 
limestone in Decorated style with a graceful stone spire ; the Church 
of the Ascension (1840) with John La Farge's mural painting of the 
Ascension, a chancel by Stanford White, and Sienese marble walls 
and pulpit; and the Church of the Transfiguration (1849), nicknamed 
" The Little Church around the Corner," and famous under the 
charge of Dr George H. Houghton (1 820-1 897) as the church attended 
by many actor3. It has a memorial window to Edwin Booth by 
John La Farge. Of Presbyterian churches the First (organized in 
1719) long occupied a brick church on Wall Street, near the old City 
Hall, and since 1845 has been on Fifth Avenue between nth and 
12th Streets; and the Madison Square Church was organized in 
1853, and after 1007 occupied one of the most striking ecclesiastical 
buildings in the city, in a quasi-Byzantine style, with a golden dome 
and a facade of six pale green granite Corinthian columns. The First 
Baptist Church (organized 1762; present building on Broadway and 
79th Street) is the oldest and the Fifth Avenue Baptist Church (1841) 
is the richest society of that denomination in the city; the Memorial 
Church (1838) is a memorial to Adoniram Judson. The first Congre- 
gational Church was built in 1809, but it was soon sold and the 
congregation disbanded; the Broadway Tabernacle on Broadway, 
near Worth Street, was a famous church in 1840-1857; the present 
church is at Broadway and 56th Street. St Peter's (Roman Catholic ; 
1785) is the oldest Catholic organization in the city; St Patrick's 
(1815) was formerly the cathedral church, and St Paul the Apostle 
(Paulist; 1859; rebuilt 1876-1885, with decorations by John La 
Farge) was established by Isaac Hecker. There are many Jewish 
synagogues and temples. 

Hotels. — The principal hotels, clubs and theatres of New York 
City have steadily been making their way up-town. Both hotels and 
clubs had their origin in the taverns of the 17th and 18th centuries, 
such as Fraunces's Tavern, on the corner of Pearl and Broad Streets, 
built in 1719, used as a residence of the De Lancey family, sold in 
1762 to Samuel Fraunces (Washington's steward after 1789), who 
opened it as the Queen's Head or Queen Charlotte, used for a time 
(1768) as the meeting-place of the Chamber of Commerce, and the 
scene, in its assembly room, of Washington's farewell to his officers 
in 1783; it was restored in 1907 by the New York State Society of 
The Sons of the Revolution, which owns the building. There are 
now few first-class hotels in the down-town district, the Astor House 
being the principal exception to the rule that the hotel district is 
bounded by 23rd and 59th Streets, and by Fourth and Seventh 
Avenues. With the rapid increase in the value of New York City 
real estate many apartment-hotels have been built, especially on the 
upper west side. The most widely-known restaurants are Delmonico's 
and Sherry's, both at Fifth Avenue and 44th Street. 

Clubs. — The clubs of New York are even more important to the 
social life than those of London, and most of them are splendidly 
housed and appointed. The oldest of the social clubs is the Union 
Club, organized in 1836. The Union League Club (organized 1863, 
incorporated 1865) was formed by members of the U.S. Sanitary 
Commission, and is the club of the leaders of the Republican party in 
the city. The Democratic organizations corresponding to it are the 
Manhattan Club (organized 1865, reorganized in 1877), and the 
Democratic Club, more closely allied with the local organization of 
Tammany Hall. The Metropolitan Club was formed in 1891 by 
members of the Union Club, with which the Calumet Club (1870) 
also is closely connected. The Knickerbocker Club was founded in 
1 87 1 by descendants of early settlers; and the St Nicholas Club by . 
descendants of residents of the city or state before 1785. The 
University Club (1865, for college graduates only) has one of the 
handsomest club-houses in the world. Among the special clubs 
chiefly for writers, artists, actors and musicians, are the Century 
Association (1847, membership originally limited to 100, devoted 
to the advancement of art and literature); the Lotos Club (1870, 
composed of journalists, artists, musicians, actors and " amateurs " 
of literature, science and fine arts); the Salmagundi Club (1871, 
artists); the Lambs' Club (1874, "for the social intercourse of 
members of the dramatic and musical professions with men of the 
world"); the Players' (1887, actors and authors, artists and 
musicians), whose building was the gift of Edwin Booth, its founder 
and first president; the Grolier Club (1884, bibliophiles) ; the Cosmos 
Club (1885, members must have read von Humboldt's Cosmos); 
and the New York Press Club (1872, journalists). The Sorosis 
(1868) is a women's club, largely professional. Other clubs are the 
New York Bar Association (1870), the Engineers' Club (1888), the 
New York Athletic Club (1868), the Racquet and Tennis Club, the 
New York Yacht Club (1844, incorporated 1865, the custodian of 
the " America's " cup) ; and the Riding Club (1883) ; the Freundschaft 
Society (1879) and the Deutscher Verein (1874) for Germans; the 
Army and Navy Club (i88q); several Hebrew clubs, notably the 
Harmonie and the Progress (1864); the Catholic Club of New York, 
and the clubs of Harvard (1865), Yale, the University of Pennsylvania, 
Cornell University and Princeton. 

Theatres, &c. — The first dramatic performances 1 in New York City 
were given in September and December 1732 by a company from 
London which played at Pearl Street and Maiden Lane; the first 
playhouse was opened on the 5th of March 1750, but in 1758 became a 
German Reformed Church ; and the second was opened with Rowe's 
Jane Shore on the 28th of December 1758, but remained a theatre 
only a little more than six years. What has been called the first 
New York theatre, opened on the 7th of December 1767 in John 
Street near^ Broadway, was the Royal Theatre during the British 
occupation in the War of Independence, and was destroyed in 1798. 
In that year was built on Park Row the Park Theatre (burnt 1820; 
rebuilt 1821; burnt 1848) in which George Frederick Cooke (1810), 
James W. Wallack (1818) and Junius Brutus Booth (1821) made 
their American debuts, in which Edmund Kean, Charles Kean, 
Fanny Kemble and Edwin Forrest played, and in which II Barbicrc 
di Siviglia, the first Italian opera given in the United States, was 
rendered in 1825, and the first ballet was danced by Fanny Ellsler in 
1840. Rivals of the Park Theatre were: the Chatham Garden and 
Theatre in 1823-1831, and later the Bowery Theatre (opened in 
1826; burntin 1828, 1836, 1838 and 1845; named the Thalia in 
1879, when it became a German theatre; and since 1892 Yiddish). 
Among famous cheat res of the iQth century the following may be 
mentioned: Niblo's Garden (built in 1829; burned in 1846; re- 
built in 1849; destroyed in 1895) was long owned by A. T. Stewart, 
and after 1866 was the scene of many spectacular shows. Palmo's 
Opera House (1 844-1 857) was the home first of Italian opera and 
after 1848, under the management of William E. Burton (1802-1860), 
of comedy. In Mechanics' Hall (1847-1868) E. P. Christy's minstrels, 
George Christy's minstrels and the Bryant Brothers appeared. 
The Astor Place Opera House (on the present site of the Mercantile 
Library; 1847-1854) is best known because of the riot at Macready's 
appearance on the 19th of May 1849, >n which many were killed by 
the police and militia. Tripler Hall (1 850-1 867) was built for Jenny 
Lind's de*but but not completed in time. Here Rache! played in 

	1 See T. Allston Brown, A History of the New York Stage (3 vols., 
	New York, 1903). 

1855, and Patti made .her debut in 1859. The hall was managed in 
l8 55 by Laura Keene and in 1856-1858 by William E. Burton, and 
in it in 1864 the three Booths played Julius Caesar, and Edwin Booth 
played Hamlet for one hundred nights. It was burned in March 
1867. In Booth's Theatre (1869-1882; managed and afterwards 
leased by Edwin Booth), Sarah Bernhardt made her American 
debut (November 1880); and in the Park Theatre (Broadway and 
21st Street; 1875-1882) Stuart Robson and William H. Crane first 

Clayed together. Light opera was first introduced in 1864, opera 
ouffe in 1867, and Gilbert and Sullivan light opera in 1879; and 
The Pirates of Penzance was produced in New York before it was seen 
in London. Most of the older theatres still in existence have become 
houses of vaudeville, melodrama or moving pictures, as, for example, 
the Academy of Music (14th Street ana Irving Place; opened in 
1854), until about 1883 the home of the best opera, in which Christine 
Nilsson, Parepa-Rosa, Salvini and Emma Nevada made their 
American debuts. The Broadway (1888) was the scene of Edwin 
Booth's last performance, as Hamlet, in March 1891. In connexion 
with the Empire Theatre (1893) is the Empire Dramatic School. 
The two largest places of amusement are the Madison Square Garden 
(opened in 1890) and the Hippodrome (Sixth Avenue and 43rd- 
44th Streets). The principal concert halls are Carnegie Music Hall 
(1891; built by Andrew Carnegie for the Symphony and Oratorio 
Societies) and Mendelssohn Hall. The Metropolitan Opera House 
(1882; burnt 1892; immediately rebuilt) gave in 1884 the first 
season of German opera in America, under the direction of Leopold 
Damrosch. The Manhattan Opera House (built in 1903 by Oscar 
Hammerstein as the Drury Lane) was opened as an opera-house in 
December 1906. In 19 10 grand opera ceased to be given except in the 
Metropolitan. Grand opera in New York has always been dependent 
for financial success on season subscriptions, and (like the great 
museums and the zoological and botanical gardens) has been sup- 
ported by millionaires. The New Theatre (1909) is practically an 
endowed house. 

Music. — Musical societies were formed in the 18th century, an 
Apollo Society as early as 1 750, a St Cecilia Society, which lasted less 
than ten years, in 1791, and the Euterpean Society, which lived a 
half century, in 1 799. ^ A New York Choral Society was established 
in 1823, a Sacred Music Society in the same year and a Philharmonic 
Society in 1824, succeeded in 1828 by the Musical Fund Society. 
The present Philharmonic Society, composed of professional players, 
was organized in 1842 by a New York violinist, Uriah C. Hill (d. 
1875). In 1847 was formed the Deutscher Liederkranz, which has 
given much classical German music; a secession from the Lieder- 
kranz in 1854 formed the Arion Society, which has been more modern 
than the Liederkranz, furnished in 1859 the choruses for Tannhauser, 
the first Wagner opera performed in America, and brought from 
Breslau in 1871 Leopold Damrosch (1 832-1 885) as its conductor. 
He founded the Oratorio Society in 1873 and the Symphony Society 
in 1877, and was succeeded as conductor of each of these societies 
by his son Walter (b. 1862). Musical instruction in the public schools 
has been under the supervision of Frank Damrosch (b. 1859), 
another son of Leopold, who formed in 1892 the People's Singing 
Classes, picked voices from which form the People's Choral Union. 

Art. — Many private collections have been given or lent to the 
public galleries of the city, in which are held from time to time 
excellent loan collections. The largest public art gallery is the 
Metropolitan Museum of Art, for which a committee, including art 
patrons and members of the National Academy of Design,' drew up 
a Dlan in 1869, and which was chartered in April 1870. General 
LuigiPaImadiCesnola(?.f.) became its director in 1879 and was suc- 
ceeded (1905-19 10) by Sir Caspar Purdon Clarke, director of the South 
Kensington Museum, and in 19 10 by Edward Robinson (b. 1858). 
In April 1871 the legislature appropriated $500,000 for a building for 
the Museum in Central Park: in 1878 the trustees took possession of 
the building in a tract of i8j acres in Central Park on Fifth Avenue 
between 80th and 85th Streets; and in March 1880 this building was 
opened. Additions were made to the south (1888) and the north 
(1894). In 1902 the central part of the E. front of a new building 
was opened, and under an appropriation of $1,250,000 in 1904 the 
building was again enlarged in 1908. Among the benefactors of the 
Museum have been : its presidents, John Taylor Johnston (1 820-1 893), 
Henry G. Marquand (q.v.) f who gave it his collection (old masters 
and^ English school), and J. Pierpont Morgan, and Miss Catharine 
Lorillard Wolfe, who gave the Museum $200,000 and her collection of 
paintings, Jacob S. Rogers (1 823-1 901) who left the Museum about 
$5,000,000, Frederick T. Hewitt, who gave more than $1,600,000, 
and John S. Kennedy (1830-1909), who left it $2,500,000. Besides 
paintingsand statuary theMuseum has collections of glass, Egyptian 
antiques, Babylonian and Assyrian seals and cylinders, tapestries, 
ancient gems, porcehin and pottery, armour, musical instruments, 
laces and architectural casts. The New York Historical Society since 
I 858 has had the collection of the New York Gallery of the Fine Arts ; 
in its art gallery are several examples of Van Dyck and Velazquez, 
the best collection in the United States (except the Jarves collection 
at Yale) of the primitives and the early Renaissance of Italy and the 
Low Countries, and a good American collection, rich in portraits and 
in the work of Thomas Cole. There is a small collection of paintings 
with some statuary in the Lenox Library and there are many private 
collections of note. The National Academy of Design (organized in 
1826; incorporated in 1828) has an art library, and students' classes. 
The Society of American Artists (1877) was a secession from the 
.Academy which it rejoined in 1906. ThisSociety with the Art Students' 
League (1875), and the Architectural League of New York (1881) 
formed in 1889 the American Fine Arts Society. In its building on 
W. 57th Street there are good galleries, it is the headquarters ofthe 
American Water Color Society (1866), the New York Water Color 
Club, the National Sculpture Society (1S93), the National Society of 
Mural Painters and the New York Chapter of the American Institute 
of Architects; and the exhibitions of the National Academy of Design 
and of the Society of American Artists are held here. The National 
Arts Club and the M unicipal Art Socicty(i 893)have club houses in Gra- 
mercy Park, The Decorative Art Association (1878) has classes and 
sales-rooms for women artists. There are art classes at Cooper Union 
(g.v.). Columbia University has a School of Architecture (1881). 

Municipal Art, Monuments, Statuary, &c. — The city charter of 
1897 established an art commission consisting of the mayor, the 
president of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the president of the 
New York Public Library, the president of the Brooklyn Institute 
of Arts and Sciences, one painter, one sculptor, one architect and 
three lay members, the last six to be apfxrinted by the mayor from a 
list presented by the Fine Arts Federation of New York. Without 
the approval ot this commission no work of art can become the 
property of the city either by purchase or by gift. Whenever re- 
quested by the mayor and board of aldermen it must act in a similar 
capacity with respect to the design of any municipal building, bridge 
or other structure, and no municipal structure that is to cost more 
than one million dollars can be erected until it has approved the 
design. The City Hall contains a valuable collection of portraits. 
In front of the Custom House are groups symbolical of the continents 
by D. C. French. The Hall of Records has historic and allegorical 
statues by Philip Martiny, H. K. Bush-Brown and Albert Weinert. 
In the Criminal Courts Building are mural decorations by Edward 
Simmons. The statuary of the Appellate Court House is by T. S. 
Clarke, K. F. T. Bitter, M. M. Schwartzott, D. C. French, F. W. 
Ruckstuhl, C. H. Niehaus and others; and it has excellent mural 
paintings by E. H. Blashfield, Kenyon Cox, C. Y. Turner, H. S. 
Mowbray and others. Of the city's great monuments the greatest 
is the tomb (1897; designed by John H. Duncan) of General U. S. 
Grant (q.v.) ; this mausoleum is in Riverside Park, commanding the 
North river, at 122nd Street. In the same park at 90th Street is the 
Soldiers' and Sailors' Monument (1900; C. W. Stoughton, A. A. 
Stoughton and P. E. Duboy), a memorial to those who fought in the 
Union army during the Civil W^ar; it has marble and granite stair- 
ways leading up to a pedestal on which are twelve fluted Corinthian 
gillars arranged in a circle and covered with a white marble canopy. 
>n Bedloe's Island in the harbour is the colossal bronze " Liberty 
Enlightening the World M (F. Bartholdi; dedicated 1886; presented 
to the people of the United States by the people of France), which is 
151 ft. 5 in. from its base to the top of the torch held in the uplifted 
hand of the female figure*. On the N. side of Washington Square at 
the foot of Fifth Avenue is the granite Washington Arch (1889; by 
Stanford White) commemorating the hundredth anniversary of the 
inauguration in New York City of George Washington as first 
president of the United States. Among other public statues and 
monuments are: Augustus St Gaudens's W. T. Sherman (1903), an 
equestrian statue in gilt bronze on a polished granite pedestal in 
Fifth Avenue at the S.E. entrance to Central Park, his D. G. Farragut 
(1880; with a granite exedra for pedestal, designed by Stanford 
White) in Madison Square, and his Peter Cooper (1894), a seated 
figure on a marble pedestal and beneath a marble canopy (designed 
by Stanford White) immediately below Cooper Union on the Bowery ; 
F. W. MacMonnies's Nathan Hale (1893) in City Hall Park; 
J, Q. A. Ward's William Shakespeare (1870), Seventh Regiment 
Memorial (1873), " Indian Hunter " (1868), and " Pilgrim " (1885) 
in Central Park, his George Washington (1882) on the steps of the 
sub-treasury, his Greeley in front ofthe Tribune building, and his 
William Earl Dodge (1885) at Broadway and 34th Street; E. 
Plassmann's Benjamin Franklin (1872) in "Printing House Square; 
Alexander Doyle's Horace Greeley (1890) in Greeley Square ; K. F. T. 
Bitter's Franz Sigel (1907) in Riverside Park at 106th Street, D. C. 
French's Memorial to R. M. Hunt (1900), a bust with a semicircular 
granite entablature at Fifth Avenue and 70th Street ; and a Columbus 
Memorial (1894; by Gaetano Russo; erected by the Italian residents), 
a tall shaft with a statue of Columbus, at 59th Street and Seventh 
Avenue. There are many other statues in the city, especially in 
Brooklyn (q.v.) and in Central Park. In Central Park on a knoll S.W. 
of the Metropolitan Museum stands the Egyptian obelisk, of rose-red 
Syene granite, the companion of that on the Thames embankment, 
London, and like it popularly called " Cleopatra's Needle," but 
actually erected by Thothmes III.; it was presented to the city by 
Ismail Pasha, Khedive of Egypt, in 1877, was brought to New York 
at the expense of W. H. Vanderbilt in 1880, and was erected in the 
park in 1881. 

Scientific Collections and Learned Societies. -r-Thc New York 
Aquarium in Battery Park has excellent exhibits of marine life; 
since 1902 it has been under the direction of the New York Zoological 
Society (organized 1895), a private corporation which has relations 
with the Park Department and the city like those of the corporations 
in control of the Botanical Gardens, the Natural History Museum 
and the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Its Zoological Park (opened 
1899) forms the southern part of Bronx Park, in which the animals 
(5528 individuals, 1146 species — 246 mammals, 644 birds and 256 
reptiles in 1910) are almost perfectly housed — in large houses, flying 
cages, pools, dens and ranges. The Botanical Gardens (incorporated 
in 1 89 1 and 1894), occupying the N. part of Bronx Park, contains 
two large conservatories (the largest in America), the largest botanical 
museum in the world (1900), with lecture hall and museum of fossil 
botany in the basement, a collection of economic plants jon the 
main floor, and a library, herbarium, laboratories, type exhibits of 
vegetation on the upper floors, and a natural hemlock grove and 
bog garden, pinetum, herbaceous grounds, flower garden, fruticetum 
and deciduous arboretum. The American Museum of Natural History 
was incorporated in 1869, and is governed by a board of trustees. On 
the ground floor of its building (77th-8ist Streets; Eighth-Ninth 
Avenues) are a lecture hall, meteorites, the Jesup collections of the 
woods of North America and of building stones, and anthropological 
and ethnological collections, particularly rich in specimens from the 
North Pacific region, collected by an expedition sent out by Morris K. 
jesup {q.v .)• On the main floor are the mammals, insects and butter- 
flies ; on the second floor the palaeontological collections, the Cope col- 
lection of fossils and (presented by J. P. Morgan)the Bement collection 
of minerals and the Tiffany collection of gems ; and on the top floor are 
a collection of shells and the library, including that of the New York 
Academy of Sciences, which was founded in 1817 and incorporated 
in 1818 as the Lyceum of Natural History, received its present name 
in 1876, and publishes Annals (1824 sqq.) and Transactions (188 1 
sqq.). Other learned societies are : the New York Historical Society 
(founded in 1804 and incorporated in 1809), which has a library rich 
in Americana, the Lenox collection of Assyrian marbles, and the 
Abbott collection of Egyptian antiquities; the American Geo- 
graphical Society (founded in 1852; incorporated in 1854), which 
issues a Bulletin (1859 sqq.); the American Numismatic Society 
(1858), with an excellent numismatic library and collection; the 
American Society of Civil Engineers (1852; with a club house and 
library); the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (1880), 
which occupies with the American Institute of Electrical Engineers 
and the American Institute of Mining Engineers (1871) a building 
given by Andrew Carnegie; and the New York Academy of 
Medicine (1847), with a technical library. 

Literature. — In literature 1 New York's position in America is 
largely due to the city's being the home of the principal publishing 
houses and, as the American metropolis, the home of many authors. 
Charles Brockden Brown, the first American professional " man-of- 
letters," although a Philadelphian by birth, was connected with 
New York City throughout his literary career; after him came the 
brilliant Knickerbocker school, including Irving, Cooper, Bryant, 
James Rodpan Drake, Fitz Greene Halleck, Charles Fenno Hoff- 
man (who in 1833 established the Knickerbocker Magazine), N. P. 
Willis, Edgar Allan Poe, J. K. Paulding, George P. Morris and Gulian 
C. Verplanck. In this early period New York literature centred 
largely about the Knickerbocker and the Mirror; and in the later 
period the monthlies Harper's (1850), the Century (founded in 1870 
as Scribner's; present name i88i),and Scribner's (1887) were great 
literary influences under the editorship of such men as George 
William Curtis, Josiah Gilbert Holland, William Dean Howells, 
Henry Mills Alden (b. 1836) and Richard Watson Gilder. Richard 
Henry Stoddard, Richard Grant White, Bayard Taylor, Edmund 
Clarence Stedman, H. C. Bunner and John Bigelow are other literary 
names connected with New York City and with its periodical press. 
The success of the older magazines has brought into the field lower- 
priced monthlies. The oldest religious weekly still published is the 
New York Observer (1823; Presbyterian); its great editois were 
Samuel Irenaeus Prime from 1840 to 1885 and afterwards his son-in- 
law Charles Augustus Stoddard. Others are the Churchman (1844; 
Protestant Episcopal), the Christian Advocate (1826; Methodist 
Episcopal), the Examiner (1823^ Baptist), the Christian Herald 
(1878) famous for its various charities under the control (1892-19 10) 
of Dr Louis Klopsch (1852-1910), the Outlook (founded in 1870 as 
the Christian Union by Henry Ward Beecher and carried on as a 
household magazine by Lyman Abbott), and the Independent (1846) 
after 1870 edited by William Hayes Ward. 

The city's cosmopolitan character is suggested by the great 
number of its newspapers published in other languages than English : 
in 1905 of all the periodical publications in New York City almost 
one-seventh (127 out of 893) were printed in languages other than 
English, 20 languages or dialects being represented. German, Yiddish 
and Italian newspapers have large circulations, and there are 
Bohemian, Greek, French, Croatian, Hungarian apd Slavonic dailies. 
To a degree the New York press is metropolitan, also; but the 
American press is not dominated by the newspapers of New York 
as the English press is by that of London (see Newspapers: United 
States). 

Education. 2 — The Dutch West India Company was bound by its 
charter to provide schoolmasters. Its first schoolmaster emigrated 

	1 See Charles Hemstreet, Literary New York, Its Landmarks and 
	Associations (New York, 1903).

	1905). 

in 1633 and his school still exists in the Collegiate School, the pro- 
perty of the Collegiate (Dutch) Reformed Church. Down to the 
middle of the 17th century the support and control of the schools 
remained with the Dutch Church. Later the desire of the English to 
hasten the substitution of the English for the Dutch language in the 
colony led to an unsuccessful attempt by the colonial government to 
reserve to itself the appointment of the schoolmasters. An English 
public school was established in 1705 under an Act of 1702, and in 
1 710 was first opened in connexion with the Anglican Church. It 
still exists as the^ Trinity School. In 1754 King's College, now 
Columbia University (gvf.), was established; the Dutch Reformed 
Church made a vain effort to secure control of it, but it became 
Anglican in its sympathies and its teachers were mostly Loyalists. 
Before the War of Independence the English language had practic- 
ally carried the day, and taken possession of the schools and churches. 

In 1787 the Manumission Society established a free school for 
negroes, which was incorporated in 1794. A Quaker society (1798), 
the "Association of Female Friends for the Relief of the^Poor," 
opened a school in 180 1, which soon became a school for white girls 
only; until 1824 it shared in the school fund and it carried on an 
infant school only from 1824 to 1846. An association known in 
1 805-1 808 as the Society for Establishing a Free School in the City 
of New York (afterwards the "Free School Society," and after* 1826 
the '* Public School Society ") opened its first school in May 1806; 
got an appropriation from the state legislature in 1807; in 1819 
brought from England a Lancasterian teacher — for the sake of 
economy the society's schools had always been conducted under the 
Lancasterian system with student " monitors " or assistant teachers; 
until 1826 was largely under the control of the Friends, giving religious 
instruction; and was supported in part by voluntary contributions, 
in part by subscriptions from those who desired to share^ in its 
management, and in a small degree after 1815 by a contribution 
from the school fund of the state. For fifty years it did virtually all 
that was done for popular education in New York City, and for 
nearly thirty years caused the exemption of the city from the opera- 
tion of the common-school system of the state; and about 600,000 
children passed through its schools. 

The Roman Catholic parochial schools opposed the Protestant 
characterof the text -books used in these public schools, and in 1840, 
followed by Hebrew and Presbyterian schools, attempted in vain to 
secure a part of the common-school fund. In 1842, as a result of this 
controversy, the city was brought under the general state system, 
but the Public School Society retained control of its own schools. 
The Board of Education opened its first schools in 1843. The right 
of the Public School Society to put up new buildings was definitely 
withdrawn in 1848; and in 1853 the Society was voluntarily dis- 
solved, and its seventeen schools and property (valued at $454,422) 
were handed over to thecity authorities; from its trustees fifteen 
commissioners were appointed to hold office through 1854, and in 
each ward where there had been a school of the Society three trustees 
were chosen.- After 1856 the control of theschools wasentirely in the 
hands of the Board of Education. A compulsory education law came 
into effect ^1875. Sincei874 the Board has controlled a Nautical 
School, a training ship being lent to the city by the Federal Navy 
Department. The separate schools for negroes were abolished in 
188a; free lecture courses were established in 1888; in 1893 seven 
kindergarten classes were established, and after 1896 a supervisor of 
kindergartens was appointed by the Board; and in 1894 a teachers' 
retirement fund was established, the first in any American city. 

In Brooklyn also the early Dutch schools were under the clergy. 
In 1815 the schools first received a part of the state common-school 
fund. There were separate district schools until 1843 when a Board 
of Education was organized. 

By the consolidation of 1898 the Boroughs of Manhattan and the 
Bronx became a unit for school purposes, the former city Board of 
Education becoming the School Board for these two boroughs; 
the former Brooklyn Board remained in control in that borough; 
and there was a Central Board of Education for the entire city 
consisting of eleven delegates from the Manhattan and Bronx Board, 
six delegates from the Brooklyn Board, and one each (the president) 
from the Richmond Board and the Queens Board. The revised 
charter of iqoi abolished the borough school boards and established a 
single board, with 46 members (22 from Manhattan, 14 from Brooklyn, 
4 from the Bronx, 4 from Queens and 2 from Richmond), and a6 local 
school boards (distributed as above) of seven members eacn, who 
took the place of the former inspectors in Manhattan and the Bronx. 
In the City Board there is an executive committee of 15 members. 
The borough superintendents were done away with in 190 1 ; the 
powers of the city superintendent were increased, and a board of 
superintendents (the city superintendent and eight associate super- 
intendents) was created. A board of examiners, nominated by the 
city superintendent and appointed by the Board of Education, 
supervises examinations taken by candidates for teaching positions, 
appointments to which are governed by rigid civil service rules. 
The development of public high schools has been rapid since the 
consolidation. In 1909-1910 trade schools and schools for the 
anaemic were established. There is an excellent system of evening 
and vacation schools. 

A Free Academy founded in 1848 for advanced pupils who had 
left the common schools was empowered to grant degrees in 1854, 
and in 1866 became the College of the City of New York, with the 
Board of Education as its Board of Trustees. In 1900 a separate 
Board of Trustees (nine members appointed by the mayor) was 
created. Before 1882 no one was eligible for entrance unless he had 
attended the city's public schools for one year. In 1907 the College 
removed to new buildings on St Nicholas Heights between 138th 
and 140th Streets, the old buildings at Lexington Avenue and 23rd 
Street being used for some of the lower classes of the seven years' 
course. The retention of the secondary school in connexion with 
college, although there are now well-equipped public high schools, is 
one of the anomalies of the New York educational system. In 1871 a 
Normal School for Girls, since 1910 the Woman's College of the City 
of New York, was established as a part ofthe public system. ^ Since 
1888 public lectures for adults have been given under the auspices of 
the Board of Education, usually in school-houses; and in 1899 the 
Board opened evening recreation centres in school-houses, in which 
literary, debating and athletic clubs meet. For the charitable schools 
see § Charities. 

The. oldest institution of higher education is Columbia University 
(q.v.). New York University was chartered in 1 831 as the University 
01 the City of New York, and in 1896 received its present name. 
The University Council is the corporation ; it consists of 32 members, 
eight* going out of office annually. The University Senate has 
immediate control; it is composed of the chancellor, 1 two professors 
of the University College, and the dean and a professor from each 
of the following schools — law, medicine, pedagogy, graduate and 
applied science. The work of the collegiate department was begun 
in 1832; a university building at Washington Square was erected 
in 1832-1835; a law school, on a plan submitted by B. F. Butler of 
New York, was established in 1835, a medical school in 1841, the 
School of Applied Science in 1862, a graduate school in 1886, a school 
of pedagogy in 1890, a veterinary college (formed by the union of two 
previously existing schools) in 1899, and a School of Commerce, 
Accounts and Finance in 1900. In 1894 tne College of Arts and 
Pure Science and the School of Applied Science were removed 
to a commanding and beautiful site on Washington Heights (about 
E. 181st Street) above the Harlem river, the schools of law and 
pedagogy remaining at Washington Square where ^ a Collegiate 
Division was opened in 1903; in 1895 the Metropolis Law School 
was consolidated with the University; in i898the Bellevue Hospital 
Medical College became a part of the University school of medicine. 
On the Washington Heights Campus the principal buildings are the 
library (1900), around a part of which extends an open colonnade, 
500 ft. long, which is known as the Hall of Fame for Great Americans, 
and in which the names of great Americans (chosen at intervals by 
the ballots of 100 prominent educators, historians, &c.) are inscribed 
on memorial tablets; and Gould Hall, a dormitory, which like the 
library and the Hall of Fame was the gift of Miss Helen Miller Gould. 
In 1909^1910 the University library contained^ about 65,000 vols, 
and the law library 22,000, and there were 254 instructors and 4036 
students (966 in the School of Commerce and 739 in the Law School). 

For Fordham University see Fordham. Other Roman Catholic 
colleges are: the College of St Francis Xavier (Society of Jesus; 
opened 1847; chartered 1861); and Manhattan College (Brothers 
of the Christian Schools ; opened 1853; chartered 1863) at Broadway 
and 131st Street, in the district formerly known as Manhattanville. 

Among the technical and professional schools, excluding those of 
Columbia University and New York University, are: the General 
Theological Seminary of the Protestant Episcopal Church (opened 
1819; in 1820-1822 in New Haven; then re-established in New 
York City), beautifully situated in "Chelsea Village " on a block 
(Ninth-Tenth Avenues and 20th-2ist Streets) given for the purpose 
by Clement Clarke Moore (1779-1863) 2 in buildings largely the gift 
of Eugene Augustus^ Hoffman (1829-1902), dean of the Seminary in 
1879-1902, and of his family, who put it on a sound financial basis; 
the Union Theological Seminary (1836; Presbyterian), which is 
representative of the post liberal tendencies in American Presby- 
terianism (q.v.), especially in regard to text-criticism; the Jewish 
Theological Seminary of America (1886), chiefly supported by the 
synagogues of New York, Philadelphia and Baltimore; the College 
of Physicians and Surgeons in the City of New York (1892; sec 
Columbia University); the Cornell University Medical College 
(1897; see Cornell University); the Eclectic Medical College 
(1865); the New York Post-Graduate Medical School and Hospital 
(1882) ; the New York Polyclinic Medical School and Hospital (1882) ; 
the New York Medical College and Hospital for Women (1863) ; the 

r The chancellors have been: in 1831-1839 James H. Mathews 
(d. 1870); in 1839-1850, Theodore Frelinghuysen (d. 1862); in 
1852-1870, Isaac Ferris (1798-1873); in 1870-1880, Howard 
Crosby; in 1 881-1 891, John Hall; and in 1 891 -19 10, Henry 
Mitchell MacCracken (b. 1840). Dr Ferris was a minister of the 
(Dutch) Reformed Church and the three chancellors since his time have 
been Presbyterian clergymen ; but the University is not sectarian. 

*C. C. Moore (1770-1863), son of Benjamin Moore (1748-1816), 
who was Protestant Episcopal bishop of New York and president of 
Columbia College in 1801-1811, was professor of Biblical learning in 
the Seminary in 1821-1850, compiled a Hebrew and English Lexicon 
(1809) and wrote some poetry including the popular juvenile verses 
beginning l( 'Twas the night before Christmas. 

New York College of Dentistry (1865); and the College of Dental 
and Oral Surgery of New York (1802). Among the normal schools 
are: the Teachers' College of Columbia University (q.v.) ; the 
School of Pedagogy and the kindergarten training school of New York 
University; the kindergarten training school of Pratt Institute in 
Brooklyn (q.v.); the Kraus Seminary for Kindergarteners; and the 
Kindergarten Normal Department of the Ethical Culture School 
under the Ethical Culture Society. Of the many private secondary 
schools in New York the oldest are the Collegiate School and Trinity 
School (see above). The Columbia Grammar School (1764) was 
originally a preparatory department of Columbia College. 

Other educational institutions of a popular character are Cooper 
Union (q.v.) and the People's Institute * (incorporated in 1807), 
which holds its meetings and lectures in theCooper Union Building. 
Its most active promoter and long its managing director was Charles 
Sprague Smith (1 853-1910), who was professor of modern languages 
at Columbia University in 1 880-1 891, and in 1896 organized the 
Comparative Literature Society; he was especially assisted by 
Richard Heber Newton (b. 1840), a Protestant Episcopal clergyman 
of broad and radical religious and social views, and by Samuel 
Gompers. The aim was to supply a " continuous and ordered 
education in social science, history, literature and such other subjects 
as time and demand shall determine " and " to afford opportunities 
for the interchange of thought upon topics of general interest . . . 
to^ assist in the solution of present problems." The Institute is 
primarily a free evening school of social science and a forum for the 
discussion of questions o£ the day. There are, besides, Sunday 
evening ethical services, " a people's church," which has attracted 
much attention, and several Institute Clubs " of a social nature, 
some of ^ them for children. The People's Institute organized a 
censorship of " moving pictures " to which most American manu- 
facturers of these films voluntarily submit. Cheap concerts are 
given in CooperUnion by the People's Symphony Concert Associa- 
tion in conjunction with the People's Institute. 

For the Brooklyn Institute see Brooklyn. The Young Men's 
and Young Women's Christian Associations have classes, especially 
for working people. 

Libraries. — " The New York Public Library, Astor, Lenox and 
Tilden Foundations," was the result of the consolidation in May 
1895 of the Astor Library (founded by the bequest of $400,000 by 
John Jacob Astor; incorporated in i849;opened in 1854; further 
endowed by William B. Astor, who gave it about $550,000 and by 
John Jacob Astor, the younger, who gave it about $800,000 and 
built the hall in Lafayette Street in which the library, for general 
reference, was housed until 191 1), the Lenox Library (originally 
the private collection, particularly rich in incunabula, Americana, 
genealogy and music, of James Lenox (1800-1880), a bibliophile 
and art amateur, given by him to the city in 1870 and until 191 1 
housed as a special reference library, in a building, designed by 
R. M. Hunt, on Fifth Avenue, between 70th and 71st streets), and 
the Tilden Trust (to which Samuel J. Tilden left his private library 
and about $4,000,000 (most of his estate) for the establishment of a 
public library, but which, owing to a contest by the heirs, was unable 
to secure the entire bequest and received only about $2,000,000 
from one of the heirs). In 1902-1911 a new building was erected to 
house these collections. With the Public Library the New York 
Free Circulating Library (incorporated in 1880; re-incorporated in 
1884) was consolidated in 1901 ; and in the next two years several 
other free libraries, including one for the blind. In 1901 Andrew 
Carnegie gave morethan $5,000,000 for about 65 branch libraries, 
the city to furnish sites for them and maintain them. The largest 
and best equipped of the college libraries is that of Columbia Uni- 
versity. The library of Cooper Union has a complete set of patent 
office reports and files of newspapers. The Mercantile Library (1820; 
established by an association of merchants' clerks) is a subscription 
library at Astor Place; the^ New York Society Library 4 (on Uni- 
versity Place) is a subscription library, the oldest in the city, being 
the outgrowth of a reading-room established in the City Hall in 1700 
by the earl of Bcllomont; it was incorporated in 1754 as the City 
Library and in 1772 under its present name. The General Society 
of Mechanics and Tradesmen (founded in 1785) since 1820 has had a 
circulating library; which with the DeMilt (reference) and the 
Slade (architectural^ collections), contains about 99,000 volumes. 

Charities. — The city has a commissioner and two deputy com- 
missioners of public charities, but this municipal department works 
largely through private organizations, the municipal appropriations 
to which exceed the amount actually expended through institutions 
controlled by the city. 6 Municipal institutions include: Belleyue 
Hospital (opened 181 6), which in 1869 established the first hospital 
ambulance service in the world, near which there is an Emergency 
Hospital (1878) for maternity cases, and in connexion with which

are the Gouvemeur Reception Hospital (1885), the Harlem Re- 
ception Hospital and Dispensary (1887) ; and the Fordham Reception 
Hospital and Dispensary (1892); the City Hospital (1853) and the 
Metropolitan Hospital (1875), both on Blackwell's Island; for 
contagious diseases Willard Parker Hospital (1866) and Riverside 
Hospital (1885; on North Brother Island in the East river); and 
for the sick, crippled and idiotic destitute children, the New York 
City Children's Hospitals and Schools (1837; on Randall's Island). 
The Manhattan State Hospital on Ward's Island (1871; now used 
for patients from New York and Richmond counties only) Central 
Islip State Hospital, on Long Island, in Suffolk county (for Queens 
county and outside of New York City, Suffolk county) and the Long 
Island State Hospital (for the county of Kings) are the state insane 
asylums for the population of New York City. 

The Charity Organization Society (organized and incorporated 
in 1882) investigates claims for charities and secures employment 
for applicants, has a bureau of information and a sociological 
library, has done much effective work through its Tenement House 
Committee and its Committee on Prevention of Tuberculosis, has a 
school of philanthropy begun as a summer school in 1808 but with 
a two-year course since 1004, and publishes a weekly journal, the 
Survey. In the United Charities Building (1891-1893; in E. 22nd 
Street), a gift of John S. Kennedy, there is housed, besides the Charity 
Organization Society, the Children's Aid Society (1853), which was 
•founded by Charles Loring Brace (1826-1890), its first secretary, has 
established industrial schools and lodging houses (the earliest 1854, 
being a Newsboys' Lodging House in New Chambers Street), vacation 
schools, kindergartens, evening classes, summer houses at Bath 
Beach (for crippled girls) and West Coney Island, and a farm school 
at Kensico, and finds homes for orphans and homeless children. In 
the same building are the New York City Mission and Tract Society 
(1822, incorporated in 1867; undenominational), the first American 
organization to introduce district nursing, whose work is all done 
below 14th street, and the Association for Improving the Condition 
of the Poor (1843 ; incorporated in 1848), which has a department of 
relief, does fresh-air work at West Coney Island, supports people's 
baths, and has founded the Hartley House (a memorial to Robert 
M. Hartley, who established the Association), a neighbourhood 
settlement. The Society of St Vincent de Paul in the City of New 
York (organized 1 835; chartered 1872) is the local Roman Catholic 
charitable organization. The United Hebrew Charities was formed 
in 1874 by the union of four Hebrew societies. The Russell Sage 
Foundation (1907) has headquarters in New York, but is not merely 
local in its work; it has a charity organization department, a child 
helping department, and a school hygiene department. " Insti- 
tutional work " by the churches is well developed. 

Trade and domestic schools include the Hebrew Technical Institute 
and the Hebrew Technical School for Girls; the New^York Trade 
School; Grace Institute, endowed by W. R. Grace (twice Mayor of 
New York City) for the instruction of women in trades; the Man- 
hattan Trade School for Girls; the American Female Guardian 
Society and Home for the Friendless; the Baron de Hirsch Trade 
Schools, in connexion with which thereare day; and evening schools 
for the instruction of immigrants (Russian, Galician and Rumanian) 
in the English language, and a colony with an agricultural and 
industrial school at Woodbine, N.J.; the Clara de Hirsch Home and 
Trade Training School for Working Girls; the New York Cooking 
School; and the Association of Practical Home Making Centres. 
The New York Diet Kitchen Association (1873) has established diet 
kitchens in connexion with many dispensaries. The City and 
Suburban Home Company (1896) provides good apartments at cheap 
rentals; the Society for Ethical Culture has promoted the same 
work; and the Mills Hotels, erected by D. 0. Mills (1825-1910), are 
low-priced but self-supporting lodging houses. 

There are many orphanages and day nurseries and there are about 
thirty permanent homes for adults in the boroughs of Manhattan 
and the Bronx. The New York Society for the Prevention of Cruelty 
to Children was incorporated in 1875, and the^ children's court 
movement in the city has been connected with this society; in its 
work and in that of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to 
Animals Henry Bergh (1 820-1 888) was the American pioneer. The 
Society for the Reformation of Juvenile Delinquents (1824) maintains 
a House of Refuge on Randall s Island; and the New York Catholic 
Protectory (1862), under the Brothers of the Christian Schools and 
the Sisters of Charity, is of a similar character. An important work 
has been done by the Society for the Suppression of Vice(i873), 
and by the Society for the Prevention of Crime, organized in 1877 
and re-organized in 1891 by its president Charles Henry Parkhurst 
(b. 1842), a Presbyterian clergyman. 

The New York Institution for the Blind was incorporated in 1831 
and originated the New York point system of tangible writing and 
printing for the blind; the Society for the Relief of the Destitute 
Blind (1869) and the New York Association for the Blind (1906) are 
noteworthy. The New York Institute for the Instruction of the Deaf 
and Dumb (1817), of which Harvey Prindle Peet (i794->873) was 
principal in 1831-1867, is a free state school and the first oral school 
for the deaf in America ; the Institution for the Improved Instruction 
of Deaf Mutes (1867) is a free city school; St Joseph's Institute for 
the Improved Instruction of Deaf Mutes (Roman Catholic; 1869) 
has a school for boys and one for girls. 

Among special hospitals the foremost are: the New York Eye and 
Ear Infirmary (1820), the New York Ophthalmic Hospital (1852), 
the Manhattan Eye and Ear and Throat Hospital (1869), the New 
York Orthopaedic Dispensary and Hospital (1866), the New York 
Skin and Cancer Hospital (1882), the General Memorial Hospital 
for the Treatment of Cancer (1884), the New York Bacteriological 
Institute (1890; maintaining the New York Pasteur Institute), and 
the Neurological Institute (1909). Important research is undertaken 
by the richly endowed Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research. 
The St John s Guild (1866, non-sectarian)maintains floating hospitals 
for tuberculosis patients and a sea-side hospital at New Dorp, 
Staten Island. There is a roof camp for tuberculous patients on the 
Vanderbilt Clinic (1886), a free dispensary, connected.with the College 
of Physicians and Surgeons. 

Many of the general hospitals have already been mentioned in the 
list of medical schools; others are: the New York Hospital (1771)1 
St Luke's (1850), tot. Sinai (1852), the Roosevelt (opened 1871)^ the 
Presbyterian (opened 1872; undenominational), the J. Hood Wright 
Memorial (1862; called the Manhattan Dispensary until 1895), the 
Hahnemann (1875), and the Flower (1890; homoeopathic; surgical). 

Population, — New York is by far the largest city in the 
United States in population, the census of 1910 returning 
its numbers as 4,766,883, and in the whole world is second 
to London only. Seven-eighths of the present area was 
annexed in the decade 1890-1900; and in those years the 
population increased from 1,515,301 (for an area of which the 
population in 1900 was 2,050,600) to 3,437,202. In 1905 the 
population by the state census was 4,000,403; of the separate 
boroughs: Manhattan, 2,102,928 (in 1900, 1,850,093; in 1890, 
1,441,216); Bronx, 271,592 (in 1900, 200,507; in 1890,88,908); 
Brooklyn, 1,355,106 (in 1900, 1,166,582; in 1800, 838,547); 
Queens, 197,838 (in 1900, 152,999; in 1890, 87,050); Richmond, 
7 2 >939 (in 1900, 67,021; in 1890, 51,693). In 1900 there was 
a slight preponderance of females (1,731, 497 females; 1,705,705 
males); the ratio of native born to foreign born was about 
as 176 to 100 (2,167,122 native born; 1,270,808 foreign born); 
less than i-8% (60,666) were negroes; and less than 0-19% 
(6321) were Chinese. Of the native population seven-eighths 
(1,892,719 out of 2,167,122) were natives of New York state. 
Of the foreign-born population (1,270,080) in 1900, more than 
one-fourth (322,343) were Germans; more than one-fifth 
(275,102) were Irish, nearly one-eighth (1 55, 2oi)Jwere Russians, 
principally Jews; more than one-ninth (145,433) were Italians; 
and the next largest numbers were: 71,427 from Austria, 68,836 
from England, 31,516 from Hungary, 28,320 from Sweden, 
25,230 from Russian Poland, 1 19,836 from Scotland, 19,399 
English Canadians, 15,055 from Bohemia, 11,387 from Norway, 
10,499 fr° m Rumania, 8371 from Switzerland and 5621 from 
Denmark. In 1900 more than two-thirds of the entire population 
was of foreign parentage, 2,643,957 being the number of all 
the persons of foreign parentage and 2,339,895 the number 
of persons having both parents foreign-born; of this latter 
number 658,912 were German, 595,267 were Irish, 257,875 were 
Russians, 214,799 wcre Italians and 103,497 were Austrians-— ^ 
these numbers as compared with the figures just given for the 
foreign-born furnish a hint as to priority of the Irish and German 
immigration to that of the Russian Jews, who like the southern 
Europeans and the Slavs came to New York in comparatively 
few numbers more than a generation before 1900. There are in 
New York City more Germans than in any city of Germany, 
save Berlin, and more Irish than in Dublin. There are many 
well-defined foreign communities in the city, such as " Little 
Italy " about Mulberry Street, " Chinatown " on Mott, Pell 
and Doyers Streets, the Hebrew quarter on the Upper Bowery 
and east of it, a " German Colony " east of* Second Avenue 
below 14th Street, French quarters south of Washington Square 
about Bleecker Street and on the west side between 20th 
and 34th Streets; a Russian quarter near East Broadway, a 
" Greek Colony " about Sixth Avenue in the 40's, and negro 
quarters on Thompson Street and on the west side in the so's; 
and there are equally well-defined Armenian and Arab quarters. 
In 1900 35% of the total working population were employed 
in trade and transportation (in Boston 34%, in Chicago 32%, 
in Philadelphia 24%) and 37% in manufacturing and mechanical

	from Russia and Rumania are largely Jews, and it is estimated that 
	one- fourth of the inhabitants of Manhattan are Jews. 

arts (in Philadelphia 41%; in Chicago 35%; in Boston 32%). 
In 1 661 the population of Manhattan Island was about 1000. 
In 1700 it was probably about 5000, the Dutch and English 
being about equally divided, and there being a few French, 
Swedes and Jews. In 1732 the population was 8624. During 
the War of Independence the city lost heavily; but the recovery 
at the close of the war was rapid, and although the population 
probably fell during the war from 20,000 to 10,000, in 1790 it 
was 33,131, then first being greater than that of Boston. From 
60,515 in 1800 the population increased to 123,706 in 1820; 
to 312,710 in 1840; to 813,669 in i860 and to 1,206,299 in 
1880. This rapid growth, the large part which immigration 
plays in the growth, the marked falling-off in the character 
of the immigrants, and the fact that it is usually the weaker and 
less enterprising immigrant who stays in New York while the 
more capable go West — all these circumstances combine to 
make a serious social problem. The low scale of living of this 
poorer class operates with the peculiar physical character of the 
city, especially on the lower East Side, where so many of the 
more recent immigrants live, to make the question of housing 
difficult. In Manhattan and the Bronx 66- 7 % of the population 
in 1890 and 72-6% in 1000 lived in dwellings in which the 
minimum number of dwellers was 21; for the whole city in 
1900 the percentage was 54*4, the corresponding percentage 
for Chicago in 1000 was 17*9. For the entire Borough of Man- 
hattan the average density was 149-0 inhabitants per acre; 
but in the Eighth Assembly District (98 acres; on the lower 
East Side, bounded S.E. by Henry Street, E. by Clinton Street, 
N. by Stanton Street, and W. by Chrystie Street), in which 
more than two-thirds of the population is foreign-born, the 
density in 1900 was 735-9 per acre, and in 1905 727-9 per acre. 
In twelve tenement blocks in Manhattan in 1905 the density 
was over 1000 per acre, the maximum being 1458 per acre in a 
block bounded by Cherry, Jefferson, Monroe and Rutgers Streets. 
A Citizens' Association with a " council of hygiene and public 
health " in 1865 employed sanitary experts to investigate the 
city's tenements. In 1879 a prize offered for the best plans for 
tenements was unfortunately awarded to the so-called " dumb 
bell " tenement, in which the court for air-space gives little air 
or light, and many of these tenements, which, however, were 
a great improvement on the older types, were built. In 1902 
the further building of " dumb bell " tenements was forbidden 
and a new Tenement House Commission was appointed. Model 
apartments have been built: in 1855 by the Workmen's Home 
Association, organized by the Association for Improving the 
Condition of the Poor; by the Improved Dwellings Company 
of Brooklyn and the Improved Dwellings Association of Man- 
hattan (1879); by the City and Suburban Homes Company 
(1896); and by some individuals. The city is comparatively 
healthy; for the five years 1 901 -190 5 the average death rate 
was 18-99 per thousand for the entire city, 20-96 for the Borough 
of the Bronx, 18-64 for the Borough of Brooklyn, 10-49 for the 
Borough of Manhattan, 16-12 for the Borough of Queens and 
18-98 for the Borough of Richmond. 

Communications. — The physical limitations of Manhattan Island 
and particularly the circumstance that the business area of the city 
is small and that the movement of passengers is almost entirely in 
one direction at any one time, have hindered the development of a 
simple and adequate system of local communications. Between 
Manhattan and Long Island there were in 1910 four bridges, three of 
them completed in the decade immediately before iqio, three of 
them to Brooklyn (q.v.) and one to Long Island City; the New York 
and Brooklyn Bridge (1872-1883), with a Manhattan terminus at 
Park Row, and the Williamsburg Bridge (1 897-1 903) from Clinton 
and Delancey Streets, Manhattan, to South 5th and 6th Streets, 
Brooklyn, are suspension bridges; for a technical description of them 
see Bridges, vol. lv.pp. 537-538. The Manhattan Bridge (1901-1909) 
is a wire cable suspension bridge situated between the two just 
mentioned; its Manhattan terminal is at Canal Street and the 
Bowery, and its Brooklyn terminal is at Nassau Street. It is the 
largest of all suspension bridges with a total roadway length of 
6855 ft. (Manhattan approach 2067 ft.; Brooklyn approach 1868 ft.; 
two land spans of 725 ft.; river span 1470 ft.) and a width of 122-5 
ft. It has a double deck, the lower for two surface car tracks and a 
wagon way, and the upper for footways and four elevated railway 
tracks. The Queensboro Bridge (1901-1909) is a cantilever from 
Second Avenue, between 59th and 60th Streets, Manhattan, to Long 
Island City, with sustaining towers on Blackwell's Island. Its total 
length, including a plaza in Queens 1 1 52 ft. long, is 8601 ft. (Manhattan 
approach 1052 ft.; Queens approach 2672-5 ft.; west channel span 
1 182 ft.; island span 630 ft.; east channel span 984 ft.) and its 
width is 80-5 ft. over all, the roadway being 53 ft. and the two side- 
walks each 16 ft. All of these bridges are crossed by electric cars, 
and on the bridges to Brooklyn there run surface cars and elevated 
trains. In 1909 an average of 4249 trolley cars and 3988 elevated 
cars crossed the Brooklyn Bridge every week day; for the Williams- 
burg Bridge the corresponding averages were 4473 trolley cars and 
918 elevated train cars. The Harlem river is crossed by about a 
dozen bridges, including High Bridge, which carries the city aque- 
duct. The ferries to Brooklyn are less important than in the days 
when there was only one bridge and no subway connexion between 
Manhattan and Brooklyn; the opening of the Pennsylvania-Long 
Island railway tube in 1 9 10 in the same way made the ferry from 
34th Street, Manhattan, to Long Island City comparatively un- 
important; and the Pennsylvania and the Hudson river subways 
have to some degree taken the place of ferryboats on the North river 
for passenger traffic between Manhattan and railways in New 
Jersey. Between Manhattan and the various islands (to North 
Brother Island from E. 16th; to Ward's Island from E. 116th; to 
Randall's Island from E. 125th and E. 120th) of the river and bay 
including Staten Island the only means of transportation is still by, 
ferryboats; the ferry line to Staten Island is owned and operated 
by the municipality. In Manhattan the first advance made on the 
horse car — which was still used to some extent in 1910, especially on 
streets along the water front — was the elevated railway; on great 
iron trestles of varying heights the first of these railways was built in 
1867-1872 on New Church Street,West Broadway and Ninth Avenue, 
from the Battery to 59th Street; in 1878 a line was built on Sixth 
Avenue, branching off on 53rd Street to Ninth Avenue, and on 110th 
Street to Eighth Avenue and running on Eighth Avenue to the 
Harlem river (155th Street), a distance of 10J m.; soon afterwards 
the Second and Third Avenue lines were built from the Brooklyn 
Bridge to the Harlem river, and the line now extends to Fordham 
(190th Street), a distance of 13 m. In 1902 the motive power of these 
elevated trains was changed from steam to electricity. In 1886 a 
cable car line was opened, the cars being operated by a clutch (or 
11 grip ") seizing a moving endless cable in a slot beneath the road 
bed; but in 1898 the "underground trolley" system began to be 
substituted. Outside Manhattan the overhead trolley is prevalent. 
In 1900^1904 another era in " rapid transit " in New York was 
begun: in the latter year was opened the Broadway subway with 
electric trains from the City Hall, along Broadway (above 42nd Street) 
to Kingsbridge (230th Street) and by a branch line, turning to the E. 
from 104th street and running, above 110th Street, on Lenox 
Avenue to the Harlem river and then through the Bronx to West 
Farms (180th Street) at the S.E. entrance to Bronx Park. In 1901- 
1906 the subway was continued to South Ferry and was carried 
under the East river to the junction of Atlantic and Flat bush 
Avenues in Brooklyn. The construction company received a fifty 
years' franchise for the operation of this subway. In 1908-1909 two 
more underground lines were opened connecting Manhattan with 
Hoboken (the terminus of the Delaware, Lackawanna & Western) 
and Jersey City (the terminus of the Erie, the Pennsylvania and the 
Central of New Jersey railways) by tubes under the North river; one 
of these extends up Sixth Avenue to 33rd Street, near the newterminal 
of the Pennsylvania railway, from which by 1910 tubes had been 
carried immediately E. and under the East river to Long Island and 
immediately W. to the New Jersey side. The municipality in 19 10 
contracted for the construction in Manhattan of lines on Broadway 
and Lexington Avenue and on Canal Street across town and for the 
continuation in Brooklyn of the subway to Coney Island and Fort 
Hamilton. 

The opening of the Erie Canal made the city the gateway for com- 
munication by water from the Atlantic Ocean to the interior of the 
continent, 1 andwhen the great railway lines were built westward it 
became the chief railway terminal en the Atlantic coast. Water 
communication up the Hudson river and through the canal is still of 
great importance. The New York Central & Hudson river and West 
Shore railways follow closely this water route to Buffalo. The Erie, 
the Lehigh Valley, the Pennsylvania and the Delaware, Lackawanna 
& Western railways reach Buffalo by routes across New Jersey, 
Pennsylvania and western New York. The New York, New Haven 
& Hartford railway affords communication with New England ; and 
the Pennsylvania and the Baltimore & Ohio railways, with the middle 
western and south-eastern parts of the country. The Central Rail- 
road of New Jersey and the Long Island railway (belonging to the 
Pennsylvania) are more local. The New York Central & Hudson 
river and^ the New York, New Haven & Hartford railways have a 
terminal in the borough of Manhattan, and the Pennsylvania has a 
terminal there also, since 1910, with tunnels to Long Island and New 

	1 Between 1840 and 1858 the tonnage cleared at New York nearly 
	quadrupled, the^ increase being from 408,768 to 1,460,998; at the 
	close of the period of the predominance of the canal as a freight 
	carrier, in the decade 1850-1860, New York City had, thanks to the 
	Erie Canal and the canals or Ohio, a monopoly of the trade of the 
	upper Mississippi basin* 

Jersey; but the other railways have their terminals on the New 
Jersey bank of the Hudson and are reached either by ferries or by 
subways under the river. The New York Central tracks are sunken 
from the Grand Central Station for about 50 blocks and then run on a 
trestle (like the '* elevated " railways) for the rest of their course in 
Manhattan. Ten steamboat lines afford communication with the 
cities and towns on the Hudson. The Old Dominion, the Clyde and 
the Savannah are among the more important coastwise lines connect- 
ing the city with ports on the South Atlantic coast. # The Metropolitan 
line connects it with Boston, and the Portland line with Portland; 
and there are several lines to ports on Long Island Sound. Among 
great trans-Atlantic lines which serve the city are the Cunard and 
the White Star lines to English, French and Mediterranean ports; 
the North German Lloyd, and the Hamburg-American lines to 
English, French and German ports; the Compagnie Generate 
Transatlantique to French ports; and the Holland-American 
line to the Dutch port of Rotterdam; the docks of some of these 
lines are on the New Jersey side of the North river, in Hoboken. 
There are also lines to the West Indies, Central and South 
America. 

Commerce.— The lack of railway lines direct to wharfs and piers in 
Manhattan is one of the commercial disadvantages of the city. 
The value of the imports received at the port of New York, which 
comprises New York Harbor and the Hudson river, increased from 
$518,796,561 in 1899 to $891,614,678 (or 60-4% of those of the entire 
country) in 1909; the value of the exports from $476,609,251 in 
1899 to $627,782,767 (or 36-3% of those of the entire country) in 
1909. The importations of works of art, furs, laces, diamonds, 
sugar, coffee, spices, cocoa, india-rubber, cigar wrappers, tin, cheese, 
hemp, hides of cattle and gloves of kid or other leather at New York 
are especially large as compared with the other ports of the country ; 
and so are the exportations of chemicals and medicines, copper, 
machinery, illuminating oil and hardware. 

The city is the principal centre of the New World for the whole- 
sale grocery and dry-goods businesses. Here are the country's most 
important " exchanges," including the Stock Exchange (1792), the 
Produce Exchange (the New York Commercial Association in 1862- 
1868), the Cotton Exchange (1871) and the Consolidated Stock 
Exchange (1885); and here are the richest and most powerful 
banks and trust companies in the New World and the great New 
York Clearing^ House. The Chamber of Commerce of the city 
was first organized and was chartered in 1768, and was reorganized 
in 1784. 

Manufactures. — Many of the manufacturing industries, notably 
the manufacture of clothing, are favoured by the abundance of 
immigrant labour. Others, such as the refining of sugar and molasses, 
derive an advantage from their position with respect to imported 
raw materials. Still others, e.g. the refining of petroleum, derive an 
advantage from their position with respect to the exportation of the 
finished products. The growth of manufactures was promoted by 
the rapid growth in commerce after the opening of the Erie Canal 
(1825) and by a great stream of immigration, and New York became 
the foremost manufacturing city in the United States about the 
middle of the 19th century. The value of its manufactured products 
increased from $1,084,850,236 in 1890 to $1,371,358,468 in 1900, 
and the total value of factory products 1 from $1,172,870,261 in 1900 
to $1,526,523,006 in 1905 (an increase of 30-2%). Clothing ranked 
first in value in 1905, and its value ($305,523, 795) was greater than 
the total value of all factory products in any other city in the United 
States except Chicago and Philadelphia. Printing and publishing, 
with products valued at $116,877,59^, ranked second. In 1905 the 
highest degree of localization of any industry in the country was in 
lapidary work, of which 96*5 % of the entire output of the country was 

Eroduced in New York City, more than 60% of the total for the city 
eing produced in Brooklyn. The boroughs of Manhattan and the 
Bronx produced in that year goods valued at $1,043,251,923, or a 
little more than two-thirds of that for the entire city; and in this 
part of the city is made more than 95 % of the clothing manufactured 
in all the city. The Borough of Brooklyn produced nearly three- 
fourths of the remainder. 

Water Supply. — The water supply 2 of the colonial city was derived 
from wells and from the many fresh-water streams and ponds which 
have now almost without exception been filled in. A system, draw- 
ing water from Collect Pond, was installed in 1774-1776 by 
Christopher Colles (1738-1821), but this never was in actual opera- 
tion. In 1709 the Manhattan Company was incorporated ostensibly 
to supply the city with water, but under an omnibus clause in its 
charter it devoted itself to the banking business. In 1829 the city 
built a reservoir on 13th Street. In 1830 De Witt Clinton suggested 
the Croton river as a source of supply. Between 18^7 and 1893 were 
constructed the first Croton Aqueduct, the Bronx river Conduit and 
the New Croton Aqueduct (see AQUEDUCT),with maximum discharges 

	1 The census of 1905 was confined to establishments under the 
	factory system; the total for all manufactured products in 1900 
	(the figure given in the 1900 census) is greater than the value of 
	factory products only (the figure given for 1900 in the 1905 census, 
	so that figures for 1900 and 1905 may be comparable). 

	1 See Edward Wegmann, The Water Supply of the City of New 
	York (New York, 1896). / 

respectively of 95,000,000 gals., 28,000,000 gals, and 302,000,000 
gals, a day. In 1905 a new Water Supply Commission was created 
and immediately afterwards work was begun on a new aqueduct* 
to bring water from the Catskills; a great reservoir (the Ashokan) 
was built more than 85 m. N. of New York, W. of Kingston (on the 
W. side of the Hudson); thence an aqueduct was constructed which 
crossed under the Hudson river between Storm King and Bear 
Mountain to the Kensico storage reservoir at White Plains, to a 
filtration plant near Scarsdale and to the Hill View distributing 
reservoir in Yonkers, and from this reservoir to the five boroughs of 
Greater New York (Queens and Richmond boroughs both being 
supplied from Brooklyn) by tunnels, the supply for Staten Island only 
being pumped through pjpes. One of the largest of the new reser- 
voirs within the city limits is the Jerome Park. The water supply 
for the typical New York City " sky-scraper " cannot be forced to 
the higher storeys of these buildings by the pumps of the municipal 
service, and such buildings must nave each its own installation of 
engines for this purpose. In 1908 a high pressure water supply 
system was installed for fire-protection of a part of the city below 
2^rd Street; induction motors driving multi-stage centrifugal pumps 
give sufficient power to force the water to a fire in the top of the 
highest buildings. (See Fires and Fire Extinction.) 

Administration. — By the close of the Dutch period the city 
had become practically self-governing. But in the permanent 
form of English government that was established by the Dongan 
charter, granted in 1686 when the English crown was attacking 
the privileges of municipalities in the mother country, the mayor 
and sheriff were appointed by the governor and council; the 
recorder, town clerk and clerk of the market were appointed 
either by the king or by the governor; and although the alder- 
men and assistants were elected by the people no ordinances 
of the common council could remain in force more than three 
months unless they were confirmed by the governor and council. 
The Montgomerie charter of 1730 was mainly an enlargement 
of the Dongan charter. From 1777101821 the mayor was chosen 
by the state council of appointment, consisting of the governor 
and four senators; from 1821 to 1834 be was elected by the 
common council; since 1834 he has been elected by the 
people. In 1730 the common council was divided into two 
chambers: the board of aldermen and the board of assistants; 
and the mayor and recorder were excluded from membership. 
In 1853 a board of sixty councilmen, in which was vested the 
sole right to originate acts appropriating money, was substituted 
for the board of assistants. The latter was restored in 1868, 
but was abolished in 1873 when the board of estimate and 
apportionment was created. Until 1849 the common council 
was an executive as well as a legislative body, and for many 
years the government was administered chiefly by its committees 
and by the heads of departments which it created and appointed; 
and the mayor's veto could be overcome by a bare majority vote 
of the members elected to each chamber. In 1849 the choice 
of the heads of departments was given to the people, and in 1853 
a two-thirds vote of the members elected to each chamber 
was required to pass an act over the mayor's veto. In 1857 
the state legislature began the appointment of boards and com- 
missions for the performance of various functions, and from this 
state interference and the popular election of the heads of depart- 
ments resulted a divided responsibility in the city government. 
The present state constitution (1894) affords some protection 
against state interference, and under the Consolidation Act of 
1882 and under the present charter of " Greater New York," 
granted in 1897 and revised in 1001, responsibility centres in 
the mayor. 

The mayor is elected for a term of four years. With the 
exception of that of finance he appoints the heads of all depart- 
ments: law, water supply, gas and electricity, fire, street 
cleaning, bridges, docks and ferries, parks, public charities, 
tenement house, health, correction, police, education, taxes and 
assessments. Even in the department of finance he appoints 
the chamberlain and two commissioners of accounts, who examine 
the receipts and disbursements in the office of the comptroller 
and chamberlain and may examine the affairs of such other 
offices or departments as the mayor may direct. All officers 
appointed by the mayor may be removed by him, except certain 
judicial officers and the members of the board of education. 

	'See A. D. Flinn, "The World's Greatest Aqueduct" in the 
	Century Magazine for September 1909. 

The aqueduct commissioners, the trustees of the College of the 
City of New York, and the trustees of Bellevue and allied 
hospitals, however, are removable only for cause and after a 
hearing. The mayor's veto of a franchise passed by the board 
of aldermen is final; his veto of an ordinance or resolution 
of the board which involves the expenditure of money, the 
creation of a debt or the laying of an assessment can be over- 
come only by a three-fourths vote; and his veto of any other 
measure of the board can be overcome only by a two-thirds 
vote. Special city legislation passed by the state legislature 
is referred to the mayor for his acceptance; if he does not 
accept it, it may be repassed by both branches of the legislature 
but must then be marked, when referred to the governor, 
" passed without the acceptance of the city." 

The department of finance is administered under the direction of 
the comptroller, who, like the mayor, is elected for a term of four 
years. He prescribes the manner in which the accounts in the other 
departments shall be kept and rendered, and all such accounts are 
subject to his inspection. His warrant, drawn on the chamberlain 
and countersigned by the mayor, is required in making a payment on 
behalf of the city. He settles claims in favour of or against the city. 
No real estate can be purchased or leased by the city without his 
consent. No contract, the expense for the execution of which is not 
in part covered by assessments on the property benefited, is valid 
without his signature. Legislation affecting the city's finances is 
determined mainly by the board of estimate and apportionment 
consisting of the mayor, comptroller, president of the board of 
aldermen, with three votes each ; the presidents of the boroughs of 
Manhattan and Brooklyn, with two votes each ; and the presidents 
of the boroughs of Queens, the Bronx and Richmond, with one vote 
each. Every October this board prepares the budget for the ensuing 
year. It is required to submit the same to the aldermen for approval, 
but the aldermen are not permitted to increase an aporopriation, to 
insert any new appropriation or to reduce that for the payment of 
state taxes, that for the payment of the interest on the city debt or 
any of those the amounts of which are fixed by law; and in case 
they reduce others their action is subject to the mayor's veto which 
they can overcome only by a three-fourths vote. 

The city's budget grew from $90,778,972 in 1900 $156,545,148 
in 1900; the assessed value of its taxable property, real and personal, 
from $3,654,122,193 in 1900 to $7,250,500,559 ($5,423,312,599 for 
Manhattan and the Bronx) in 1909, when the real estate was valued 
at $6,807,179,704. The net funded debt in December 1909 was 
$653,270,379, the gross bonded debt being $946,005,728; the floating 
debt was $60,367,290, and the sinking fund was ,$232,368,060. 
Among the large items of the 1909 budget were: $27,470,737 for 
education; $47,225,078 for redemption and interest of the city 
debt; $20,235,115 for miscellaneous city and county expenses; 
$14,160,202 for police; $8,428,596 for borough governments; 
$8,039,565 for fire protection; $7,418,299 for street cleaning; 
$6,511,143 for water supply and public lighting; $4,760,651 for 
charitable institutions; $3,319,065 for parks; $2,512,606 for 
public charities ; and $2,484,859 for health. The state constitution of 
1894 fixed the debt limit of all municipalities at 10% of the assessed 
valuation of their real estate. An amendment of 1899 (in effect 
1900) excepted from the debt limit of New York City the previous 
debt of the counties now wholly included in the city; another 
amendment adopted in 1905 excepted from this limit debts 
incurred by the City of New York after the 1st of January 1904 
to provide for the supply of water; and an amendment, adopted in 
1909, excepted from the debt limit bonds issued after December 31st 
1909 for such public improvements owned or to be owned by the 
city as yield a revenue in excess of what is required to meet the 
interest and principal of such bonds; also indebtedness incurred 
prior to January 1st 1910 for rapid transit or dock properties 
in proportion to the extent to which the revenue meets the interest 
and the instalments to be paid for the redemption of the bonds, such 
increase of the debt limit to be used, however, only for rapid transit 
or dock improvements. The same amendment (1909) also authorizes 
the city to issue, during any one year, in excess of its former debt limit, 
bonds to be redeemed out of the tax levy for the ensuing year to 
the extent of one-tenth of 1 % of the assessed value of the real estate 
of the city subject to taxation. 

The board of aldermen, whose power is less than formerly, is 
composed of a president, elected on the city ticket for a term of four 
years; the five borough presidents, each elected by his borough for a 
term of four years ; and 73 aldermen, elected by districts for a term 
of two years. Each head of an administrative department is entitled 
to a seat in the board but no vote ; he is required to attend the board's 
meeting whenever it requests him to do so and must answer questions 
relating to his department. The board is required to meet once each 
month except in August and September. Each administrative 
department has a single head with the exception of the department 
of parks, the department of health and the department of educa- 
tion; and each head of a department has full power of appointing 
and removing subordinates except that a person holding a position 
in the classified civil service subject to competitive examination can 
be removed only for cause. The head of the department of parks 
is a board of three park commissioners: one for the boroughs of 
Manhattan and Richmond, one for the boroughs of Brooklyn and 
Queens and one for the Borough of the Bronx; one of the three is 
designated by the mayor as president of the board. The head of the 
department of health is also a board of three members; the com- 
missioner of health, who is president of the board, the police com- 
missioner and the health officer of the port. The department of 
education is described in the paragraph on education. Railway, gas 
and electric companies doing business within the city are subject to 
the extensive control of a public service commission of five members 
who are appointed by the governor of the state (see New York). 

In New York county^ which comprises the boroughs of Manhattan 
and the Bronx, there is no county court, but in its place are a city 
court and a court of general sessions. The city court is a civil court, 
having jurisdictionover cases in which the amount involved does not 
exceed $2000, and is composed of seven justices elected for a term 
of ten years. The court of general session is a criminal court, having 
jurisdiction of all crimes including murder, and is composed of the 
city judge, the recorder and three justices of the sessions, each 
elected for a term of fourteen years. New York county elects a 
surrogate for a term of fourteen years, and Kings has two county 
judges; but in Queens and Richmond the county and surrogate 
courts are the same as in other counties of the state. In each of 
twenty-eight districts into which the city is divided a municipal- 
court justice is elected for a term of ten years and sessions of the 
municipal court, which has jurisdiction of civil cases in which the 
amount involved does not exceed $500, are held. For the adminis- 
tration of criminal justice by magistrates (justices of the peace) the 
boroughs of Manhattan and the Bronx constitute the first division 
and the other three boroughs constitute the second division. I n each 
division there is a board of magistrates appointed by the mayor for 
a term of ten years, and the magistrates hold the several courts of 
their division in rotation according to such rules as they themselves 
establish. There is also in each division a court of special sessions 
consisting of six justices appointed by the mayor for a term of ten 
years; it has jurisdiction in all misdemeanour cases except libel and 
must be held by three justices. In the first division both the 
magistrates and the justices of the court of special sessions are re- 
quired to hold a separate court for hearing charges against children 
under sixteen years of age. 

Each borough has a president with extensive power, and the city 
is divided into twenty-five local improvement districts, each having 
a board composed of the president of the borough and the alderman 
representing the district. The president appoints and removes at 
pleasure a commissioner of public works, who, subject to his control, 
directs his administration relating to streets, sewers, public buildings 
and supplies. The borough president prepares all contracts relating 
to his borough. In Queens and Richmond he directs the cleaning of 
the streets. In Manhattan, Brooklyn and the Bronx he is directed 
by the charter to appoint a superintendent of buildings, who, subject 
to him and with the aid of inspectors, enforces the ordinances of the 
aldermen relating to the construction, alteration and removal of 
buildings ; in Queens and Richmond the borough president may 
appoint such an officer only when authorized to do so by the board of 
aldermen upon the recommendation of the board of estimate and 
apportionment. A borough president is chairman of each of the 
local improvement boards. 

History. — The discovery of New York Bay and the Hudson 
river by Verrazano in 1524 was followed only by occasional 
visits of trading or exploring vessels until the arrival of Henry 
Hudson in 1609. Beginning with 1610, Dutch merchants 
despatched several vessels to engage in the fur trade with the 
Indians, and in 1614 a ship commander, Adriaen Block, having 
lost his vessel, built the " Qnrust " or " Restless " on the shore 
of Upper New York Bay. About the same time a few huts 
were built at the south end of Manhattan Island. When New 
Netherland had been erected (1623) into a province of the 
West India Company (see New York), that body chose the 
south end of Manhattan Island for a trans-Atlantic shipping 
station and for tbe seat of government. In 1626 Peter Minuit, 
the director-general of the province, bought the entire island 
from the Indians for goods valued at 60 guilders (about $24) 
and at what was then its southern extremity began the erection 
of Fort Amsterdam; and at the close of the year the settlement, 
New Amsterdam, comprised thirty bark-covered dwellings. 
For several years it was maintained wholly in the interest of 
the Company, and to none of the inhabitants, all of whom were 
its agents or employees, were given any political rights, title to 
land or right to European trade on his own account. The 
company divided a large portion of the island into six farms of 
its own, and when by its Charter of Privileges and Exemption 
(1629) it attempted to encourage agriculture in other parts of 
the province (see New York State) it reserved to itself the whole 
island. In 1633 New Amsterdam received a grant of " staple 
right " by which it could compel any vessel passing the port 
either to offer its cargo for sale or pay a duty; in 1638 the Company 
extended to all friendly European countries the privilege of 
trading with the province, and about this time it opened town 
lots for sale. The town rapidly assumed the cosmopolitan 
character for which it has ever since been noted, there being, 
according to a contemporary report, eighteen languages spoken 
by its 400 or 500 inhabitants in 1643. In 1641, to gain the 
necessary support to fight the Indians, Kieft had to yield to the 
demand for a popular voice in the government, and permitted the 
heads of families to choose a board of Twelve Men to confer 
with him. In 1643 he permitted the choice of a board of Eight 
Men, and when he refused its demands it was largely instrumental 
in effecting his recall. Under his successor, Peter Stuyvesant, 
a board of Nine Men was chosen, and this body, objecting to 
the customs duties which he imposed, sent three of its number 
with a petition to the States-General with the result that in 
1653 New Amsterdam was made a city with a government 
administered by a schout, two burgomasters and five schepcns. 

Chiefly with a view to protection from roving traders the great 
burgher-right and the small burgher-right were established in 
1657; the great burgher-right being conferred on all who had 
been magistrates as well as on those then in office, on clergymen, 
on militia officers and on the male descendants of all such 
persons; and the small burgher-right being conferred on all 
native-born citizens, on the husbands of native-born women 
and on all who had been residents of the city for a year and six 
weeks. Other persons approved by the magistrates were 
allowed to buy the great burgher-right for 50 guilders ($20) 
or the small burgher-right for 20 guilders ($8). Only burghers 
and employees of the West India Company could engage in 
commerce, work at a trade or practise a profession, and only 
great burghers could hold the more important offices. Originally 
Stuyvesant appointed the city officers, but in 1658 he permitted 
them to nominate their own successors. Besides engaging in 
the fur trade, the city was now exporting considerable timber 
and food-stuffs; in the coast trade it was beginning to reap 
the advantages of its situation on the coast route through Long 
Island Sound; and its trade with the Dutch West Indies was 
of some importance. But the city and the Company were always 
at odds. The duties exacted by the Company were a heavy 
burden and yet the Company did not keep the fort in good 
repair. Stuyvesant's arbitrary rule primarily in the interests 
of the Company was another grievance, and when in August 
1664 there appeared in the harbour an English fleet sent by 
the duke of York for the conquest of the province, the city was 
in a defenceless condition. Richard Nicolls, the representative 
of the duke, easily won over the burgomasters and other 
prominent citizens; Stuyvesant, practically deserted, was 
driven to a formal surrender on the 8th of September; and 
New Amsterdam became New York. 

In June 1665 Nicolls reorganized the government, vesting 
it in a mayor, aldermen and sheriff, to be appointed by the 
governor of the province for a term of one year; and extended 
the city's limits to include the whole of Manhattan Island. In 
1666 he granted to New Harlem, founded in 1658, a charter 
which gave to it the status of a town within the city. Nicolls' 
successor, Governor Francis Lovelace, established a post-route 
from New York to Boston in 1673. On the 30th of July 1673 
the city was surprised and captured by a Dutch fleet under 
Cornelis Evertsen and Jacob Binckes. The captors renamed 
the city New Amsterdam and in January 1674 Anthony Colve, 
the newly appointed governor of the province, re-established 
the Dutch city government, but under the treaty of Westminster 
the English again took possession in November. In 1678 
Governor Edmund Andros gave the city practically a monopoly 
within the province of commerce " over seas " and ordered 
that flour should be inspected nowhere else; two years later 
he required that all flour for export should be bolted and packed 
within the city. The duties established by order of the duke 
of York were still a grievance, and when, in 1681, Governor 
Andros had sailed for England without renewing the ordinance 
imposing them, the merchants refused payment and demanded 
that they should thereafter be imposed by a representative 
assembly* The duke yielded and the first New York Assembly, 
called by Governor Thomas Dongan, met in the city on the 17th 
of October 1683. Less than three years later, on the 20th of 
April 1686, Dongan gave the city its first real charter, which 
is a historic instrument in the city government; it was super- 
seded only to a very small extent as late as 1830 (when there 
was a revision of the charter) and on it as a basis the later 
charters have been framed. 

New York City with its numerous artisans, small traders, 
sailors and common labourers, such as usually compose the party 
of discontent, was the centre of the Leisler uprising (see New 
York State) incited by the English Revolution of 1688, and 
it was here that Leisler in the spring of 1690 called the first 
intercolonial assembly to plan an expedition against Canada. 
During Leisler's rule, too, the freeholders of the city were for 
the first time permitted to elect their own mayor, a privilege 
not subsequently granted until 1834. Before the close of the 
17th century New York had become a favourite haunt of pirates; 
leading merchants assisted pirates as well as privateersmen 
in fitting out their vessels and shared in their plunder or at 
least welcomed them with their rich cargoes, and public officials, 
including one or more governors, were also implicated. The 
home government finally appointed Richard Coote, earl of 
Bellomont (1636-1/01), governor with explicit instructions 
to suppress the evil. Before he received his commission he and 
Robert Livingston sent out William Kidd (d. 1701) with a 
frigate to capture the pirates. Kidd himself turned pirate, but 
was arrested in Boston in July 1699, was sent to England for 
trial and was hanged in May 1701. Bellomont met determined 
opposition among New York officers and merchants; but by 
the close of his brief administration (1 698-1 701) he had caught 
a number of the pirates and broken up the corrupt system by 
which they had been protected. The importation of negro 
slaves was begun in 1725 or 1726 and was somewhat encouraged 
by the States-General. Becoming prized as household servants 
they so increased in number in the city that during the first 
half of the 18th century they were not greatly outnumbered 
by the whites; the whites early began to fear a slave insurrec- 
tion, and ordinances were passed forbidding negroes to gather 
on the Sabbath in groups of more than four, or to carry guns, 
swords or clubs; but one night in April 17 12 some slaves met 
in an orchard near Maiden Lane, set fire to a building and killed 
.nine men besides wounding several others who came to put 
out the fire. Soldiers then captured all the insurgents except 
six, who committed suicide, and after trial twenty-one were 
executed. When early in 1741 nine fires broke out within a few 
weeks and a negro was seen running from the last, the belief 
became general that the negroes had formed a plot to burn the 
town. A reward of £100 was offered for information exposing 
the plot, and the testimony of an indentured servant-girl, Mary 
Burton, that her master, mistress, a few other whites and a 
number of negroes were implicated in such a plot threw the 
city into a panic. Other confessions were extorted by threats, 
and on such worthless testimony four whites were executed, 
fourteen negroes were burned at the stake, twenty were hanged 
and seventy-one were transported. The frenzy was checked 
when Mary Burton began to accuse persons of consequence and 
above suspicion. The New York Gazette, the first newspaper 
of New York, established by William Bradford in 1725, was a 
semi-official organ. For criticizing the government in the 
New York Weekly Journal, which he established in 1733, John 
Peter Zenger was charged with libel in 1734, and by securing 
his acquittal in the following year the popular party established 
the freedom of the press (see New York). At the beginning 
of the Stamp- Act controversy John Holt's New York Gazette 
and Weekly Post- Boy, the successor of Bradford's Gazette, was 
the medium through which the popular leaders stirred the 
people to resistance. The Stamp-Act Congress, called at the 
suggestion of Massachusetts, sat in the city from the 7th to the 
28th of October 1765, and on the 31st of October the New York 
merchants started the non-importation movement which spread 
to the other colonies. Lieut.-Governor Cadwallader Colden 
prepared for the enforcement of the Act by strengthening Fort 
George (a later name for Fort Amsterdam) and increasing its 
garrison. The ship with the stamps arrived in the evening of 
the 23rd of October and on the following night threatening 
notices were posted on the doors of every public office and at 
the corners of streets. When the day (1st of November) came 
for the Act to go into effect Governor Colden had retired within 
the fort. Major James, the commander of the garrison, had 
threatened to enforce the Act; but the Sons of Liberty gathered 
a mob, broke into the governor's coach-house, burned his coach 
and burned him in effigy, destroyed the furniture and other 
property of Major James and threatened to storm the fort. 
On the 5th, the governor delivered the stamps to the mayor 
and aldermen. No serious attempt was subsequently made 
to enforce the Act, and its repeal (18th of March 1766) was 
celebrated on the city common with noisy demonstrations and 
the erection of a liberty pole. The Assembly also made appropri- 
ations for the erection of statues of the king and William Pitt. 
The Sons of Liberty opposed the passage by the Assembly of 
appropriations for the maintenance of the soldiers, and the 
latter retaliated by repeatedly cutting down liberty poles 
erected by the Sons of Liberty. Finally in a skirmish on the 
1 8th of January 1770 the soldiers killed one man and severely 
wounded several others, and this bloodshed is memorable as 
the first in the struggle which culminated in the independence 
of the colonies. The tea shipped to New York for testing the 
right of p&rliament to tax the colonies did not arrive until four 
months after that shipped to Boston had been thrown over- 
board, but when it did arrive (April 1774) the chests in one 
vessel were destroyed in the same manner as were those in 
Boston and the other vessel was forced to carry its cargo back 
to London. The Port Act for punishing Boston stirred the 
New York merchants as well as the Sons of Liberty (chiefly 
mechanics and artisans), and when the latter again threatened 
violence the merchants resolved to guide the movement, and 
called a mass meeting and named a committee of correspondence 
of fifty-one members. This committee, on the 23rd of May 1774, 
proposed a Continental Congress chiefly with a view to obtaining 
an effective regulation of non-importation from England; it 
also named the New York delegates to that body. 

During the greater part of the War of Independence the city 
was occupied by the British. Its capture was a part of the 
British plan to get control of the Hudson and separate New* 
England from the southern colonies. Early in 1 7 76 the Americans 
began to throw up fortifications at several points on both banks 
of the East river in the hope of closing the east water front to the 
enemy. Other fortifications were erected on Governor's Island 
and at some points along the west water front to the upper end 
of Manhattan Island, where an attempt was made to close the 
passage of the Hudson by building Fort Washington on the New 
York bank and Fort Lee on the New Jersey bank and connecting 
them with a line of sunken ships fastened together with chains. 
To the north of the city proper, also, defences were constructed 
along the line of the present Grand Street, and to prepare for a 
retreat from the north end of the island a redoubt, which the 
British later called Fort George, was built on the prominence 
overlooking Kingsbridge from the south, and Fort Independence, 
in what is now Bronx Borough, was built to command the 
approach from the mainland. After the battle of Long Island, 
fought within the present limits of Brooklyn Borough, Wash- 
ington, on the night of the 29th of August 1776, crossed to 
Manhattan Island. As the city was no longer tenable, some of 
the generals proposed burning it, but Congress would not give 
its consent and Washington, although withdrawing the greater 
part of his army behind fortifications on Harlem (now Washing- 
ton) Heights, continued to occupy it with about 5000 men under 
General Israel Putnam until the British general, Sir William 
Howe, began to show signs of attack. Troops also remained 
behind the batteries along the east water front, and it was on 
this occasion that Nathan Hale went on his fatal errand to 
ascertain Howe's intentions, was discovered within the British 
lines and was hanged as a spy. On the 15th of September 
several British ships which had some days before passed the 
American batteries, as far as Montressor's (now Randall's) 
Island, entered Kipp's Bay, at the foot of the present 34th 
Street, routed the militia posted behind the low breastworks 
there, and after landing narrowly missed cutting off the rear of 
Putnam's retreating army. One portion of Howe's army took 
possession of the city and another marched toward Harlem 
Heights along the east side of what is now Central Park while 
Putnam's men were marching in nearly parallel columns on the 
west side of the park. On the 16th, in the hattle of Harlem 
Heights (on what is now Morningside Heights), about 1800 
Americans drove a somewhat smaller number of British troops 
from the field. In October Howe sailed up the East river, and 
Washington, to avoid being outflanked, retreated to the main- 
land, leaving only a garrison at Fort Washington. Howe landed 
at Pell's Point (now within Pelham Bay Park), and on the 28th, 
a few miles north of the present city limits, was fought the battle 
of White Plains. Howe then turned westward and southward 
and on the x6th of November captured Fort Washington. What 
is now Bronx Borough was .within the " Neutral Grounds " 
which suffered greatly from the foraging parties of both armies. 
Six days after the British entered the city proper about one- 
fourth of it was destroyed by fire, and the desolation was ex- 
tended by another large fire on the 3rd of August 1778. The 
British crowded their prisoners (who suffered terrible hardships) 
into several of the churches, the City Hall, the new gaol (later 
the Hall of Records), King's College, the Livingston sugar house, 
and a number of ships moored in the harbour. The city was a 
refuge for Loyalists, but even they were treated with contempt 
by the British. The homes of Loyalists and Whigs alike were 
plundered, and when the British finally evacuated (25th of 
November 1783) they had robbed the city of its wealth and 
had destroyed its business. 

For the first three or four years after the return of peace 
recovery in some directions was very slow; but only a few 
months after the British had gone an American merchantman 
sailed from the port bound for China and opened trade with 
that country. Trade was speedily resumed with European ports, 
and by 1788 it was not uncommon to see 100 or mere vessels in 
the port either loading or unloading. On the question of enlarg- 
ing the powers of the Federal government in 1 787-1 788, the city . 
strongly supported Alexander Hamilton and John Jay against a 
determined opposition in other parts of the state, and the ratifica- 
tion of the Federal constitution in the state convention at 
Poughkecpsie was a triumph for New York City. The city was 
the Federal capital in 1 789-1 790 and under its strong Federalist 
influence the new government of the nation was organized. 
During the colonial era New York was always the seat of the 
provincial government and for twenty years it was at times the 
seat of the state government, but in 1797 Albany was made the 
permanent capital. In 1807 the success of steam navigation was 
assured by the trial trip of Robert Fulton's " Clermont " from 
New York to Albany and return; but the city did not benefit 
immediately from this invention. On the contrary, the Embargo 
Act ( 1 807-1 809) threatened its commerce with ruin. It revived 
under the Non-Intercourse Act, but suffered again from the 
second war with Great Britain. In the first and second years of 
this war some merchants reaped profits from privateering against 
the enemy, but in December 1813 the British stopped privateering 
by a closer blockade of the harbour and in 1814 they threatened 
to attack the city. In preparing to resist, the city erected or 
assisted in erecting elaborate fortifications, and Robert Fulton 
was busy in New York building a steam frigate with cannon-proof 
sides and heavy guns, but the war closed without a test of the 
fortifications and before the frigate was ready for action. 

In 1817 the Erie Canal was begun and the first line of trans- 
I Atlantic packet-ships was established. The canal, opened in 
1825, insured the commercial supremacy of New York among 
American cities. The years immediately following the close of 
the second war with Great Britain also mark the beginning of a 
rapid increase in the number of European immigrants, and this 
stream of immigration, rising to a flood in the fourth decade and 
continuing high throughout the century, has been a dominant 
force in determining the city's social and political conditions. 
Although the city was a stronghold of the Federalists at the time 
the National government was organized, the Democrats, owing 
to the dexterous management of Aaron Burr, were victorious 
in the elections of 1800 and 1S01, and the city has continued to 
be normally Democratic owing largely to the activities of the 
Tammany Society or Tammany Hall (q.v.). This organization, 
founded in 1789, early espoused the cause of the unfranchised 
inhabitants, attended to the wants of the immigrants in various 
ways, led the movement for universal manhood suffrage and the 
election of city officers, and, after the office of mayor became 
elective (1834) and the last property qualifications for city voters 
were removed (1842), continued strong by reason of the support 
of the great mass of foreign-born citizens. Fraud and corruption 
were resorted to by Tammany, and offices were used for the good 
of the organization rather than for the good of the city. Socially, 
the immigrants deluged the city with vice, crime, misery and 
pauperism. The unsanitary conditions had already caused 
epidemics of yellow fever in 1795, 1798, 1S22 and 1823, and the 
city was visited in 1832, 1834 and 1849 with epidemics of cholera 
in which several thousand lives were lost. These scourges 
together with a fire in 1835, which destroyed the East Side below 
Wall Street, hastened the construction of works for getting a 
supply of water from the Croton river. The immigrants repre- 
sented various nationalities and religious sects, and from 1830 
to 1 87 1 the city was frequently disturbed by riots arising usually 
from national or religious antipathy. During the first mayoralty 
election (1834) there was rioting; and there were an abolitionist 
riot in the same year, a flour riot during the financial panic of 
1837, and labour riots from time to time which were suppressed 
by the police. In 1857 the state legislature established a state 
or " metropolitan " police for the better protection of the city. 
The mayor, Fernando Wood, contending that the act was 
unconstitutional, resisted with the old municipal police, and 
another serious riot had begun when the Seventh Regiment 
of state troops compelled obedience; later, too, the court of 
appeals decided against the mayor. 

Wood was still mayor at the outbreak of the Civil War, and 
in January 186 1 he proposed to the Common Council that Man- 
hattan Island, Long Island and Staten Island should secede 
and constitute a free city, to be named Tri-Insula. The Council 
approved. But when, in April, the city had been aroused by 
the bombardment of Fort Sumter the majority of the Democrats 
joined with the Republicans in discarding the proposal and in 
support of the Union. The native-born and loyal citizens 
joined the Union army in such large numbers that the city was 
left with inadequate protection from such of its inhabitants 
as had often constituted the mob. In this state of affairs the 
drafting of men for the army was begun in July 1863 in con- 
formity with an act of Congress which exempted from its opera- 
tion all who should make a money payment of $300. The New 
York proletariat and unscrupulous politicians complained that 
the measure was peculiarly oppressive to the poor, and the rioting 
with which it was resisted was protracted and bloody. The 
rioting began the 13th of July and continued for nearly five days. 
More than fifty buildings were burned. The mob was especially 
furious against negroes, a number of whom were hanged or 
beaten to death. The police fought bravely but were unequal 
to the emergency, and order was restored only after several 
regiments had returned to the city and had killed at least 500 
of the rioters. In 187 1 Irish Catholics threatened to prevent 
the Orangemen from parading the streets on the anniversary 
of the Battle of Boyne (12th of July). The superintendent of 
police also issued an order on the preceding day prohibiting the 
parade. Public opinion, however, was so strong in favcur of 
the Orangemen that the order was revoked, and five regiments of 
militia were called out to protect the parade before it started; 
at the first assault the mob was scattered by a volley which killed 
51 persons. The militia suffered a loss of three killed and several 
wounded. 

The character of the population did not improve speedily, 
for while immigrants were coming in great numbers a large 
portion of the saving middle class was removing to the suburbs; 
and although Tammany Hall was discredited during the Civil 
War, it gained control of the state as well as the city government 
soon after the war. William M. Tweed, its ruler, organized the 
" Tweed Ring " which was plundering the city on a gigantic scale, 
when in 1871 its operations were exposed by the New York 
Times. The thefts of the " Ring M amounted to many millions 
of dollars, those in the erection of the county court house alone 
to $8,000,000. Several of the malefactors were sent to prison 
and Tweed himself died there. Tammany, however, was 
victorious again in the second election (1874) after Tweed's 
fall, and in 1884, when rival companies were seeking to obtain 
a franchise for working a street railway on Broadway, this 
privilege, so valuable that the city could have sold it for millions 
of dollars, was given away by the aldermen; and it was after- 
wards proved that a number of them had shared a cash bribe 
of $500,000. Some of them were subsequently punished, but 
Tammany's power was not seriously impaired. In 1874 the 
city's corporate limits were extended to include about 13,000 
acres across the Harlem river: in 1895 there was a further 
extension in the same county to the southern borders of Yonkers 
and Mt. Vernon; and in 1898 all of Kings county, all of 
Richmond county (Staten Island) and a portion of Queens 
county were consolidated with it. As Tammany's stronghold 
was in Manhattan, the annexation of these districts diminished 
the difficulty of holding Tammany in check, or of defeating it 
at the polls whenever the anti-Tammany forces united as a 
consequence of a notoriously corrupt administration. In 1894 
an investigation of the state Senate brought to light some of the 
facts respecting an elaborate system of blackmail which had grown 
up under the joint protection of Tammany Hall and the city 
government. Under this system large sums were paid for 
appointments to office and promotions, and money was collected 
regularly from the keepers of gambling houses, houses of ill- 
fame and other disorderly resorts, and from liquor sellers for 
permission to violate certain details of the excise laws, such as 
midnight and Sunday closing. There followed a great outcry 
against Tammany and it was driven from power for three years. 
During the reform administration, Colonel George Edward 
Waring (1833-189S), as head of the street cleaning department, 
quite revolutionized New York as respects cleanliness. The 
police service and the school system were also much improved. 
Tammany was successful in the election of 1897 when the opposi- 
tion was divided. It again abused its power and was defeated 
in 1901. In 1903 and 1905 the Tammany ticket was elected, but 
the mayor, George Brinton McClellan, administered the govern- 
ment, especially during his second term (1906-19 10), independ- 
ently of Tammany Hall. With the exception of the mayor the 
Tammany ticket was defeated in 1909, and the mayor, William 
Jay Gaynor(b. i85i),w.aslittle in sympathy with Tammany Hall, 
having been nominated apparently for the purpose of insuring 
the election of loyal Tammany men on the county ticket.

NEW ZEALAND, a British colonial Dominion (so named in 
1907), consisting mainly of a group of islands lying in the south 
Pacific between 34 25' and 47 17' S., and between 166 26' 
and i78°36' E. The group is situated eastward of Tasmania 
and Victoria, and Wellington, its capital and central seaport, 
is 1204 m. distant from Sydney. Of certain outlying clusters 
of small islands belonging to the colony, the Chathams (356 m. 
E. of Cook Strait), Aucklands and Campbell Island are alone of 
any value. All these are grassy and the Chathams are inhabited 
by sheep-farming colonists. The Aucklands contain two of the 
finest harbours in the Pacific. Six hundred miles north of 
Auckland,, the volcanic Kermadecs, covering 8208 acres, are 
picturesquely clothed with vegetation. In Polynesia a number 
of inhabited islands were brought under New Zealand control 
in 1893. Raro tonga and Mangaia, in the Cook group, and 
Niu6 or Savage Island are the largest of these; Penrhyn and 
Suwarrow, though but small coral atolls, contain excellent 
harbours. Rarotonga is hilly, well watered, and very beautiful. 
Apart from these little tropical dependencies New Zealand has 
an area of 104,471 sq. m., of which its two important islands, 
called North and South, contain 44,468 and 58,525 respectively, 
while, divided from South Island by Foveaux Strait, Rakiura 
or Stewart Island, mountainous and forest-clad, contains 
621 sq. m. These three form a broken chain, North and South 
Islands being cut asunder by Cook Strait, a channel varying in 
width from 16 to 90 m. 

North Island is 515 m. long and varies in breadth from 6 to 
200 m. It is almost cleft in twain where the Hauraki Gulf 
penetrates to within 6 m. of Manukau Harbour. From the 
isthmus thus formed a narrow, very irregular peninsula reaches 
out northward for some 200 m., moist and semi-tropical, and 
beautiful rather than uniformly fertile. Rich strips of alluvial 
soil, however, seam a cold clay-marl, needing intensive cultivation 
to become highly productive. Buried in this clay-marl are found 
large deposits of the fossil resin which becomes the kauri gum 
of commerce; and on the surface extensive forests are still a 
great though diminishing source of wealth. Though a species 
of mangrove fringes much of this peninsula, its presence does 
not denote malaria, from which the islands are entirely free. 

South of the isthmus aforesaid, North Island rapidly 
broadens out. Its central physical feature is the unbroken 
mountain chains running N.E. from Cook Strait to East Cape 
on the Bay of Plenty, ranges seldom under 3000 ft., but never 
attaining 6000 ft. in height. Ikurangi, their highest summit, 
though a fine mass, does not compare with the isolated volcanic 
cones which, rising W. of the main mountain system and quite 
detached from it, are among the most striking sights in the island. 
Ruapehu (9100 ft.) is intermittently active, and Ngauruhoe 
(7515 ft.) emits vapour and steam incessantly. Egmont (8340 
ft.) is quiescent, but its symmetrical form and dense clothing 
of forest make it the most beautiful of the three. North of the 
two first-mentioned volcanoes Lake Taupo spreads over 238 sq. m. 
in the centre of a pumice-covered plateau from 1000 to 2000 ft. 
above the sea; and round and beyond the great lake the 
region of the thermal springs covers 5000 sq. m. and stretches 
from Mount Ruapehu to White Island, an ever-active volcanic 
cone in the Bay of Plenty. The most uncommon natural feature 
of the district, the Pink and White Terraces, was blown up in 
the eruption of Mount Tarawera in 1886, when for great distances 
the country was buried beneath mud and dust, and a chasm 9 m. 
long was opened in the earth. Fine lakes and waterfalls, in- 
numerable pools, in temperature from boiling-point to cold, 
geysers, solfataras, fumaroles and mud volcanoes still attract 
tourists in large numbers. The healing virtue of many of the 
springs is widely known. The government maintains a 
sanatorium at Lake Rotorua, and there are private bathing 
estabh'shments in other places, notably near Lake Taupo. In 
South Island there are hot pools and a state sanatorium at 
Hanmer Plains. Experience shows that the most remarkable 
cures effected by the hot waters are in cases of gout, rheumatism, 
diseases of the larynx and in skin disorders. Though, thanks 
to the overlaying porous pumice, the Taupo plateau is not 
fertile, it has a good rainfall and is drained by unfailing rivers 
running through deep terraced ravines. The Waikato and 
Waihou flow N., the Rangitaiki N.E., and Mokau, Wanganui 
and Rangitikei W. or S.W. The first named, the longest river in 
the colony, though obstructed by a bar like all western, — and 
most eastern, — New Zealand rivers, is navigable for some 70 m. 
The Mokau and Wanganui run between ferny and forest-clad 
hills and precipices, often of almost incomparable beauty. 

East of the Taupo plateau and south of Opotiki on the Bay of 
Plenty the steep thickly-timbered ranges held by the Uriwera 
tribe still show scenery quite unspoiled by white intrusion. 
On the southern frontier of this mountainous tract Waikare 
Moana extends its arms, the deepest and most beautiful of the 
larger lakes of the island. 

From the mouth of the Waikato southward to about 25 m. 
from Cape Terawhiti on Cook Strait, and for a distance of from 
20 to 40 m. inland, the western coast skirts fertile country well 
fitted for grazing and dairy-farming, to which it is being 
rapidly turned as the timber and fern are cleared away from its 
low hills, downs and rich vallej's. On the east coast the same 
fertility is seen with less forest, and, round Hawkes Bay, a hotter 
and drier summer. In the south centre, the upland plain of 
the Wairarapa, ending in a large but commonplace lake, has a 
climate adapted for both grazing and cereals. The butt-end of 
the island, of poor, rough, wind-beaten hills, is redeemed by the 
fine harbour of Port Nicholson, which vies with the Waitemata 
in utility to New Zealand commerce. Broken as is the surface, 
poor as is the soil of certain tracts, there is but little of the island 
which will not ultimately be cultivated with profit as pumice 
and clay-marl yield to labour. Everywhere the settler may count 
on a sufficient rainfall, and — except on the plateau and the 
mountain highlands — mild winters and genial summers. The 
pleasant climate has certain drawbacks; the coastal farmer 
finds that blights and insect pests thrive in the comparative 
absence of hard frosts. Fortunately mosquitoes are not a serious 
plague outside a few marshy localities. To pass Cook Strait 
and land in the middle province of South Island is to pass from 
Portugal to Switzerland, a Switzerland, however, with a sea- 
coast that in the east centre is a dull fringe of monotonous sand 
dunes or low cliffs. As a rule, nevertheless, the shores of South 
Island are high and bold enough. They are not too well served 
with harbours, except along Cook Strait, in Banks Peninsula, and 
by the grand but commercially useless fjords of the south-west. 
In the last-named region some fifteen salt-water gulfs penetrate 
into the very heart of the mountains, winding amid steep, cloud- 
capped ranges, and tall, richly-clothed cliffs overhanging their 
calm waters. The dominating features of south New Zealand 
are not ferny plateaus or volcanic cones, but stern chains of 
mountains. There the Southern Alps rise range upon range, 
filling the whole centre, almost or quite touching the western 
shore, and stretching from end to end of the island. West of the 
dividing crest they are forest clad; east thereof their stony 
grimness is but slightly softened by growths of scrub and tussock 
grass. Nineteen-twentieths of .the colonists, however, live east 
of the dividing range, for to that side settlement was attracted 
by the open, grassy character of the country. The rivers are 
many, even on the drier eastern coast. But, as must be expected 
in an island but 180 m. across at the widest point and yet showing 
ridges capped with perpetual snows, the rivers, large or small, 
arc mountain torrents, now swollen floods, anon half dry. Almost 
useless for communication or transport, they can be easily drawn 
upon for irrigation where, as in the east centre, water-races are 
useful. The largest river, the Clutha, though but 80 m. long 
in its course to the south-east coast, discharges a volume of water 
estimated at nearly 1,100,000 cubic ft. a minute. On the west 
the only two rivers of importance are the Buller and the Grey, 
the former justly famous for the grandeur of its gorges. Large 
and deep lakes fill many of the mountain valleys. Te Anau and 
Wakatipu (54 m. long) are the chief, though Manapouri is the 
most romantic. Aorangi (Mt. Cook) is easily first among the 
mountain peaks. Its height, 12,349 ft,, is especially impressive 
when viewed from the sea off the west coast. On the north-east 
a double range, the Kaikouras, scarcely fall short of the Southern 
Alps in height and beauty. Apart from the fjords and lakes the 
chief beauties of the Alps are glaciers and waterfalls. The 
Tasman glacier is 18 m. long and has an average width of 1 m. 
15 chains; the Murchison glacier is 10 m. in length. To the west 
of Aorangi glaciers crawl into the forest as low as 400 ft. above 
sea-level. Among waterfalls the Sutherland is 1904 ft. high, 
but has less volume than the Bowen and others. The finest 
mountain gorge, the Otira, is also the chief route from the east 
to the west coast. It begins on the western side of Arthur's 
Pass, a gap the floor of which is 3100 ft. above the sea. Generally 
the open and readily available region of South Island extends 
from the Kaikouras along the east and south-east coast to the 
river Waiau in Southland. It has a mean breadth of some 30 m. 
In compensation the coal and gold, which form the chief mineral 
wealth, are found in the broken and less practicable west 
and centre, and these portions also furnish the water-power 
which may in days to come make the island a manufacturing 
country. (W. P. R.) 

Geology. — New Zealand is part of the Australasian festoon, on the 
Pacific edge of the Australasian area. Unlike Australia, its geological 
structure is unusually varied, and owing to its instability, it includes, 
for its size, an unusually completeseries of marine sedimentary rocks. 
It has, moreover, been a volcanic area of long-continued activity. 
The physical geography of New Zealand is closely connected with its 
geological structure, and is dominated by two intersecting lines of 
mountains and earth movements. The Southern Alps, the back- 
bone of the South Island, rest on a foundation of coarse gneisses 
and schists, that are quite unrepresented in the North Island. The 
continuation of this line of old rocks is occupied by the basins of the 
Wanganui river and Taupo. E. Suess therefore suggested that the 
northern continuation of the Alps had foundered, and its summits 
been buried beneath the Pliocene marine rocks of the Wanganui 
basin and the volcanic rocks of the Taupo area. 

The oldest rocks are Archean, represented by the band of gneisses 
and schists exposed along the western foot of the Southern Alps. 
To the south of the district in southern Westland, where the Alps 
have passed out to sea, the Archeans become more extensive; for 
they spread eastward and underlie the whole of the dissected table- 
land of Otago. It has been suggested that the jasperoids and 
diabases of the Tarawera Mountains on the North Island may be of 
Upper Archean^ age, from their resemblance to the Heathcotian 
rocks of Australia. No Cambrian rocks have as yet been discovered, 
but the Ordovician system is represented by the Aorere beds in the 
north-western part of the South Island. Here they contain numerous 
graptolites, including Tetragraptus, Dichograptus and Didymograptus. 
The Silurian system is represented by the Baton river beds to the 
west of the Aorere beds, occurring in the basin of the Motueka river, 
which flows into Tasman Bay. The Devonian system is well ex- 
posed in the Reefton mining field. The Carboniferous system 
includes either the whole or a large part of the Maitai beds. The 
Maitai beds include a thick mass of slates and sandstones, which form 
the bulk of the Southern Alps, whence branches extend south- 
eastward to the coast. The beds take their nape from the Maitai 
river near Nelson^ they are largely developed in the mountains of 
the Tararua-Ruahine-Raukumara chain, on the eastern side of the 
North Island; they occur in the Kaikoura Mountains, and an outlier 
forms Mount Torlesse, near the eastern edge of the Southern Alps, 
west of Christchurch. The Maitai beds have generally been considered 
to be Carboniferous from the presence of species of Productus found 
in the Permo-Carboniferous of New South Wales. But Professor 
Park has obtained Jurassic fossils in the Maitai series; so that it will 
probably be ultimately divided between the Carboniferous and 
Jurassic. The two systems should, however, be separable by an 
unconformity, unless the Maitai series also includes representatives 
of the Kaihiku series (the New Zealand Permian), and of the Wairoa 
series, which is Triassic. 

New Zealand includes representatives of all the three Mesozoic 
systems. The Hokanui group comprises the Triassic Wairoa and 
Otapira beds, and the Jurassic Mataura beds. The Wairoa series 
includes marine limestones characterized by Monotis salinaria, and 
the Otapira series is characterized by Spiriferina spatulala. The 
Mataura beds are largely of estuarine formation; they contain oil 
shales and gas springs. 

The Cretaceous system includes the Waipara series, a belt of chalky 
limestones with some phosphate beds at Clarendon in eastern Otago. 
Their fossils include belemnites, ammonites, scaphites and marine 
saurians, such as Cimoliosaurus. These Cretaceous limestones are 
interbedded with glauconitic greensands, as at Moeraki Point in 
eastern Otago. The second type of Cretaceous is a terrestrial 
formation, and is important as it contains the rich coal seams of 
Greymouth, Westport and Seddonville, which yield a high quality 
of steam coal. Cretaceous coals have long been worked in the North 
Island, north of Auckland, on the shores of the Bay of Islands, where 
the age of the coal is shown by its occurrence under the Whangarei 
or Waimio limestone. 

The Cainozoic system is represented by OHgocene, Miocene, 
Pliocene and Pleistocene beds. The best-known OHgocene rocks 
are the limestones of Oamaru and the brown-coal measures of 
Waikato. The Oamaru limestones have been largely used for 
building stones; they are a pure white limestone, largely made up of 
foraminifera, bryozoa and shell fragments, and contain the teeth of 
sharks {e.g. Carcharodon) and of toothed whales such as Squalodon 
serratus.^ In southern Otago the OHgocene beds are brown coals 
and lignites with oil shales, which, at Orepuki, contain 47% of oil 
and gas, with 8% of water. The Miocene Pareora beds occur to 
the height of 3000 or 4000 ft. above sea-level, in both the 
North and South Islands. Some of its fossils also occur in the 
Oamaru series, but the two series are unconformable. In Westland 
the Miocene includes the Moutere gravels, which rest on the summit 
of Mount Greenland, 4900 ft. above sea-level. 

Marine beds of the Pliocene arebest developed in the Wanganui 
basin. They consist of fine clays with nodular calcareous concretions 
richjn fossils. The^ Pleistocene system in the South Island includes 
glacial deposits, which prove a great extension of the New Zealand 
glaciers, especially along the western coast. The glaciers must have 
reached the sea at Cascade Point in southern Westland. On the 
eastern side of the Alps the glaciers appear to have been confined to 
the mountain valleys. The Pleistocene swamp deposits are rich in 
the bones of the moa and other gigantic extinct birds, which lived on 
until they were exterminated by the Maori. The Cainozoic volcanic 
history of New Zealand begins in the OHgocene, when the high 
volcanic domes of Dunedin and Banks Peninsula were built up. 
The Dunedin lavas including tephrites and kenytes correspond to 
the dacite eruptions in the volcanic history of Victoria. The building 
up of these domes of lavas of intermediate chemical type was followed 
by the eruption of sheets of andesites and rhyolites in the Thames 
Goldfield and the Taupo volcanic district. The volcanic activity of 
the Taupo district lasted into the Pleistocene, and the last eruptions 
contributed many of its chief geographical features. 1 (J. W. G.) 

Climate.— Diversity of level and latitude cause many varieties 
of climate in the South Island provinces. The height and 
regularity of the mountain backbone increase the diversity. 
Only one pass, the Haast (1716 ft), crosses' from E. to W. 
at a less height than 3000 ft. Along the whole west coast the 
climate resembles nothing in the British Islands so much as 
Cork and Kerry, for there are the same wet gales from a western 
ocean, the same clouds gathering on the dripping sides of wild 
mountains, an equal absence of severe frosts and hot sunshine, 
and a rich and evergreen vegetation. Elsewhere, sheltered 
Nelson has a more genial air than the Wellington side of Cook 
Strait. Foveaux Strait is as cold and windy as the Strait ot 
Dover. The Canterbury plain has but 26 ins. of annual 
rainfall, less than a fourth of that along the western littoral. 
Very seldom indeed is moisture excessive in the eastern half; 
there is even a deficiency in unfavourable years, and dry, 
warm winds do damage to crops. Insect life is relatively not 
abundant; the air is brisk and bright with ample sunshine. 
The snow-line, which is at 3000 ft. on the eastern flank of the 
Alps, is 3700 ft. on the western. 

The healthiness of the New Zealand climate in all parts is 
attested by the death-rate, which, varying (1896-1906) from 
9 to 10-50 per 1000, is the lightest in the world. In 1896 
it was as low as 9*10. In 1907, however, it was 10-91, the highest 
figure since the year 1883. Even in the boroughs the average 
is below 13. The rainfall in most of the settled districts ranges 
from 30 to 50 ins. a year. Meteorological statistics are collected 
at Auckland, Wellington, Christchurch, and Dunedin and eight 
other stations ; and observations of rainfall, temperature, 
and wind-directions are received from eighteen stations of the 
second class. From the data thus obtained an isobaric map 
and a report are prepared for each day; and weather warnings 
are telegraphed to any part of the coast when necessary. A 
system of inter-colonial weather exchanges has been agreed 
upon, and telegrams are daily exchanged between Sydney and 
Wellington. 

Flora. — There are about one thousand species of flowering plants, 
of which about three-fourths are endemic. Most of those not 
peculiar to the country are Australian; others are South American, 
European, Antarctic; and some have Polynesian affinities. Ferns 
and other cryptogamic plants are in great variety and abundance. 
The New Zealand flora, like the fauna, has been cited in support of 
the theory of the remote continental period. In appearance the more 
conspicuous flora differs very greatly from that of Australia, Poly- 
nesia, and temperate South America, and helps to give to the 
scenery a character of its own. 

The early colonists found quite half the surface of the archipelago 
covered with dense, evergreen forest, a luxuriant growth of pines and 
beeches, tangled and intertwined with palms, ferns of all siz^s, wild 
vines and other parasites, and a rank, bushy, mossed undergrowth. 
Though much of the timber is of commercial value — notably the 
kauri, totara, puriri, rimu, matai and kahikatea — this has not saved 
the forests from wholesale, often reckless, destruction. Two-fifths 
perhaps have already disappeared, and it is probable that in fifty 
years the only large tracts still standing will be sub-alpine woods and 
in state reserves. Meanwhile charred and rotting stumps give a 
melancholy and untidy air to valleys and denuded hillsides, for 
hard-wood stumps — and most New Zealand trees are hard-wood — 
take more than a generation to decay utterly. Compelled by the 
windy climate the colonists are doing something to repair these 
ravages by planting European, Californian and Australian shelter- 
trees; but it is only in the naturally open and grassy regions of the 
east and south-east that settlement as yet improves the landscape. 
There, before the colonists came, wide sweeps of dull green bracken 
or wiry yellow-green tussocks seemed bleak and monotonous enough. 
The swamps covered with flax and giant bulrushes were often re- 
deemed to the eye by sheets of golden-plumed to€-toe\ a kind of 
pampas grass. 

Fauna. — The destruction of the forest is telling fatally on the 

	* l See the geological map of New Zealand by Sir James Hector 
	(1884). A brief sketch of its geological history is given by Hutton, 
	Trans. New Zealand Inst. (1899), xxxii. pp. 159-183. Fullest inform- 
	ation about the geology of New Zealand is given in the Reports of 
	Geological Explorations issued by the Geological Survey of New 
	Zealand, and the Annual Reports of the mines department. A 
	bibliography of the chief literature has been compiled by A.

native avifauna. In their natural state the islands were without 
land mammals, and the Polynesian immigrants brought but two in 
their canoes — a dog, now extinct, and a black rat, now rarely seen. 
Until recent years the forest birds did much to atone for this de- 
ficiency, for among them the tui and makomako rank high as 
songsters, while the apteryxes, kakapo, weka and stitch-bird are of 
peculiar interest to science. The importation of stoats and weasels, 
ferrets and cats has resulted in a process of extermination which 
has already made it necessary to set aside the islets Resolution, 
Kapiti and Little Barrier as sanctuaries. The place of the vanishing 
native species is being taken by such European arrivals as sky-larks, 
finches, blackbirds, sparrows and rooks. Outside the forest country 
the weka, an almost wingless bird, is numerous, and in the Alps a 
hawk-like green parrot, the kea, has learned to kill sheep and holds 
its ground. The pukeko, a handsome rail, abounds in swamps. The 
native wild ducks are carefully preserved for sportsmen, in whose 
interests pheasants, red and fallow deer, and brown and rainbow 
trout have been very successfully acclimatized. Acclimatization, 
indeed, had played a chief part in the settlement of New Zealand. 
Coming to a country without useful animals, cereals, rich grasses 
or fruit trees, the colonists had to bring all these necessaries with 
them. So far acclimatizers note but few failures; the chief case is 
that of the salmon. Again and again salmon have been successfully 
hatched out into rivers, but the young fish hastening down stream 
to the sea never return thence. This is all the more unfortunate as 
eels were the only large edible creatures found in the fresh- water 
kites and rivers. Tidal waters furnish minute whitebait, and the 
mud-flats of salt or brackish lagoons and estuaries flounders — both 
very delicate eating. Oysters, both mud and rock, are good and 
plentiful. A strange visitor, the frost-fish, never seen at sea, is 
picked up stranded on sandy beaches in cold weather, and is prized 
by epicures. The snapper is at once the handsomest and most 
palatable of a good variety of sea fish. Sharks are found everywhere 
and are common round the north, though they rarely attack man. 
The albatross is of course the most conspicuous sea bird. Penguins 
are found, confined to the islets of the far south. As some com- 
pensation for its paucity of useful animals and food plants, New 
Zealand was, of course, free from wild carnivora, has no snakes, and 
only pne poisonous insect, the katipo, a timid little spider found on 
certain sea-beaches. Of poisonous plants only the berries of the 
tutu and the karaka are worth notice. The wild dogs and pigs 
which now sometimes prey on the sheep-farmers* lambs in outlying 
districts are the descendants of domestic animals which have 
escaped into the " bush." Among imported pests the rabbit and 
sparrow, and a numerous company of European and American 
thistles and other weeds, have to be systematically contended with. 
The formidable increase of the rabbit has been arrested, mainly by 
poison and wire-netting fences. 

Population. — In January 1840 there may have been 2000 
whites in New Zealand. By 1861 the number was still slightly 
under 100,000. During the next twenty years the gold dis- 
coveries, the public works expenditure, and the development 
of agriculture, multiplied the number of colonists five times 
to 498,000 in April 1881. Then increase slackened for many 
years, and was slowest between 1886 and 1891, when the ad- 
dition was but 48,000 in five years. In 1901 the whites numbered 
773,000; and between that year and the census computation 
in April 1906 the increase, 115,859, was the largest yet recorded 
in any quinquennium. -In the middle of 1908 the official estimate 
of white inhabitants was 950,000. 

The white population, about nine to the square mile, is very 
unevenly distributed. In the South Island nine-tenths of the 
colonists live within 40 m. of the east and south-east coasts; 
in the North Island the eastern and northern parts of Wellington 
province, and the southern and broadest part of Auckland 
province are still very scantily peopled. For all that, Auckland 
and Wellington are the most populous of the larger districts, 
while Nelson, Westland and Marlborough have for a long time 
shown the slowest increase. 

Males still exceed females in the proportion of nine to eight. 
About 70% of the population is New Zealand born. The white 
foreign element is small; what there is is chiefly Scandinavian, 
German and Dalmatian. Among the foreigners males greatly 
outnumber females; even in the case of the German settlers 
the proportion is two to one. 

Between 1880 and 1892 the birth-rate fell by no less than 
12-95 points — rather more than 1 a year. It continued to fall 
for seven years more, though at a much reduced rate, and 
finally reached 25*12 in the year 1899. In the next eight years 
there was a slow recovery to 27*30 in 1907. Thanks, however, 
to the low death-rate, elsewhere referred to, the margin of 
increase in New Zealand is over 17. To that, and to the annual 
gain by immigration, the fairly rapid rate of increase is due. 
Between 1885 and 1801 the colony lost more than it gained 
oversea; but from 1892 to 1908 the gain by immigration was 
90,000. Probably, at least half of these represent Australians, 
impelled to emigrate by years of drought. England and Scotland 
supply the bulk of the remainder. The government has aided 
immigrant farmers and farm labourers having a certain sum 
of money, also female domestics, by paying part of their passage 
money. 

The people of colour in 1906 numbered 53,000, including 
2300 Chinese and 6500 Maori half-castes. An apparent increase 
of 7000 in the Maori and half-castes between 1891 and 1906 
is, perhaps, partly due to more accurate computation. It seems 
probable that the number of Maori and half-castes taken together 
is about the same as it was thirty years ago, though the infusion 
of white blood is larger. The Public Health Department has 
exerted itself to improve the sanitation of native villages and 
combat the mischievous trickery of Maori wizards and 
" doctors." 

Wealth. — The increase of wealth went on after 1879 in spite of dull 
times, and was only checked by the especially severe financial 
depression of 1893 and 1894, caused by low prices and the Australian 
bank panic. The estimated private wealth of colonists fell from 
£236 per head in 1890 to £219 in 1895. It was computed in 1905 to 
have reached £292. After deducting debts'owing abroad the public 
and private wealth of the colony is calculated to be about 
£270,000,000. 

Of the five banks of issue doing business in the dominion three are 
Australian and New Zealand institutions. Their deposits exceeded 
£21,000,000 in 1907, as against £12,250,000 in 1890. At the same 
date more than £10,000,000 stood to the credit of small depositors in 
post office and private savings banks, nine-tenths in the former. 
The gross amount insured by policies in life insurance offices 
(ordinary and industrial) was over £29,000,000, of which the state 
office claimed two-fifths. 

Trade. — The growth of sea-trade in recent years is shown by the 
larger size of the ocean-going vessels trading with the colony. The 
number of these only advanced from 589 to 629 between 1896 and 
1906. But the increase of tonnage in the eleven years was from 
614,000 tons to 1,243,000; while the crews rose from 20,000 to 32,500. 
The coasting trade and trade with Australia are carried in New 
Zealand-owned vessels. 

External trade has risen from £13,111,000 in 1887 to £37,371,000 
in 1907. Before 1886 exports exceeded imports; but in the twenty 
subsequent years there was an invariable excess of exports, valued in 
all at £52,000,000. 

The re-export trade is stationary and extremely small. Trade with 
the United States grew from £877,000 in 1891 to £2,140,000 in 1907. 
Thanks to the tariff of the United States the balance of trade with 
North America is heavily against New Zealand. The same dis- 
parity is shown in her trade with Germany, which is, however, much 
smaller — less than half a million. Trade with India and Ceylon 
reached £557,000 in 1906; that with Fiji and other Pacific islands 
was £622,000 in iqoo. With these exceptions New Zealand trade is 
almost all done with Australia (£5,348,000 in 1907) and the United 
Kingdom; the latter's share in 1906 was £26,811,000 of the whole. 

Production. — Wool (£4,250,000 to £71657,000 according to prices) 
remains at the head of the list of exports. The quantity grown in- 
creased by 70% in the twenty years 1887-1906. Moreover the 
export of sheep skins and pelts was valued at £680,000 in the last- 
mentioned year. But the description changes; there is much less 
merino, and more of the coarser and longer cross-bred. The number 
of sheep has increased from 16,564,000 in 1886 to 22,000,000 in 1908, 
though the increase has been almost all in North Island. The number 
of the flocks grows, and the average size diminishes even more rapidly. 
There were 9149 flocks in 1886; in 1906 the number had risen to 
18,500 — average size of each flock about 1050. The smaller size of 
the flocks and the breeding of sheep for meat rather than for wool, 
the cultivation of English grasses and of extensive crops of turnips 
and other roots on which to fatten sheep and lambs, all tend to 
change sheep-farming from the mere grazing of huge mobs on wide, 
unimproved runs held by pastoral licences. The " squatters " still 
occupy eleven million acres, but even these are more closely sub- 
divided than in former days. How much more extensive is grazing — 
of the more scientific order — than agriculture, is seen at once from 
the figures of the amount of land broken up, for crops or other 
purposes, and the amount under sown grasses. There were about 
1,600,000 acres under crop in 1899. This is exclusive of the vast area 
of native-grass land. The area now occupied and utilized by whites 
is about 38,000,000 acres. 

The character of the soil and the moist cool climate enable English 
grasses to be sown almost everywhere, and 13,000,000 acres are now 
laid down with these. The result is seen in the price obtained for 
New Zealand sheep in Smithfield Market, which is from Jd. to id. 
per lb higher than that given for frozen mutton from other countries.

In the market for frozen Iambs the colony remains at present without 
a rival. Frozen beef is also sent to England. In 1907 the export of 
frozen meat was valued at £3,420,000. The export of butter and 
cheese has risen in value from £207,687 in 1890, till in 1907 that of 
butter amounted to £1,615,000. In London, New Zealand cheese 
fetches as high a price as Canadian; the value of the cheese ex- 
ported was £662,000 in 1907. Though not yet quite equal in im- 
portance to wool or frozen meat, dairy-farming is almost entirely 
carried on by small farmers and their families, who supply milk to 
factories. Most of these are co-operative, their shareholders being 
the farmers themselves. The profits of the industry are thus widely 
distributed among the producers. The development of dairy- 
farming has led to the spread of settlement, especially in the west of 
North Island, where large tracts of fertile soil formerly covered with 
forest have now been cleared and converted into dairy-farms. Of 
1,850,000 cattle in the colony, two-sevenths are dairy cows. 

The importance of hemp as an export — increasing from £26,000 in 
1898 to £832,000 in 1907 — has led to improvements in cleaning and 
grading it. In consequence its price in London nearly approaches 
that paid for manila. 

Mining. — The export of gold, which was £1,220,000 in 1880,. 
did not exceed that figure until 1898, and, indeed, fell below three- 
quarters of a million in 1887. Then gold-mining, after being long at 
a standstill, began again to make headway. For many years the 
surface alluvial mining in South Island became less and less profitable. 
As in other countries, however, the working of quartz reefs gradually 
compensated for this. The cyanide process of gold extraction, and 
the returns obtained by its means from the great Waihi mine in the 
Upper Thames, caused an outbreak of gold fever, which led to the 
opening up of a few good and a great many worthless quartz-mines 
in the Auckland fields. In South Island the river-beds of Otago 
province have been successfully worked by means of dredges, and 
good returns secured. In 1907 the gold exported was valued at 
£2,027,000. The total value of the gold exported from New Zealand 
from the discovery of the metal in 1857 to 1907 was, roundly, 
£70,000,000. Kauri gum still holds its place as an export, over 
£500,000 worth being dug up annually.^ The number of Istrians and 
Dalmatians who came from the Adriatic to dig for kauri gum led to- 
the passing of restrictive laws.

Excellent as the quality of the best New Zealand coal is, the cost of" 
mining and shipping it prevents the growth of any considerable 
export trade. Silver is chiefly extracted in the Thames district, 
but other mines containing silver ores have been found. There are 
many other valuable ores — copper, iron, lead, zinc, antimony, chrome 
and manganese. Petroleum springs have been tapped near New 
Plymouth. Building stones of various kinds and of excellent quality 
abound. Marble and cement stones occur in many places. There 
are extensive deposits of iron-sand on the west coast of the North 
Island, and of iron ore at Parapara in Nelson. 

Manufactures. — Protected by a tariff wall which was repeatedly 
heightened between 1879 and 1907, manufactures made considerable 
progress. At the end of 1885 about 22,000 work-people were being 
employed in 1946 workshops, and the aggregate output was valued 
at six millions and three-quarters. Twenty years later the number 
of establishments was 4186; the number of hands 56,000; and the 
output twenty-three millionsand a half. A small deduction should 
be made from this apparent increase to allow for a changed system 
of classification. Male factory hands greatly outnumbered female, 
standing in the ratio of four to one. Between 1879 and 1895 wages 
fell. Between 1895 and 1906 they rose 15% on the average among 
males of all ages, and as much as 30% among women and girl 
workers. The disproportionate rise in the case of females is probably 
due to the policy of the industrial arbitration court. The chief 
factory industries come under the following heads: meat-freezing 
and tallow; tanning and wool-scouring; flax mills, saw-mills and 
grain-mills; boots and shoes; woollen and clothing; butter and* 
cheese; breweries; printing houses; foundries; agricultural imple- 
ment and machine shops; soap and candle works; coach-building 
and furniture; gas-works. Except in meat-freezing, wool-scouring, 
butter- and cheese-making, flax-milling and timber-sawing, manufac- 
turing is almost entirely for consumption within the colony. 

Government. — New Zealand was not colonized in the ordinary 
manner around one centre. There were in its early years six 
distinct settlements — Auckland, Wellington, Nelson, New 
Plymouth, Canterbury and Otago — between which communica- 
tion was for several years irregular and infrequent. To meet 
their political wants the Constitution Act of 1852 created 
them into provinces, with elective councils and superintendents 
respectively, subordinated to one colonial legislature. In 1876 
the provincial system was abolished. The general assemhly, as 
it is called, is composed of the governor, the legislative council, 
and the House of Representatives. The governor is appointed 
by the crown, but his salary, £7500, is paid by the colony. The 
legislative council consists of members appointed for seven 
years by the governor in council; the number of legislative 
councillors stays at or near forty-five. The House of Repre- 
sentatives consists of eighty members chosen by the electors. 
The members of both houses are paid. The franchise is adult 
suffrage, conditional on a previous residence in the colony for 
a year, including six months in the electoral district for. which 
a claim to vote is registered. Every elector is qualified for 
election. Four members of the house must be Maori elected 
by their own race. The duration of the house is for three years, 
but it is subject to re-election whenever the governor dissolves 
the general assembly. Legislation is subject to disallowance 
by the crown, but that power is seldom exercised. Executive 
administration is conducted on the principle of English re- 
sponsible or parliamentary government. The government is 
represented in England by a high commissioner. Local ad- 
ministration is vested in local elective bodies, such as municipal 
councils, county councils, road boards, harbour boards, charitable 
aid boards, and others, with power to levy rates. The colonial 
revenue is chiefly derived from customs, stamp duties, land tax, 
income tax, beer excise, postal and telegraphic services, railways, 
and crown land sales and rents. The proceeds of land sales 
are applied to surveys and public works. Customs duties, 
railways and stamps are by far the most important sources 
of revenue. They yielded £3,103,000, £2,765,000 and £1,550,000 
respectively out of a total revenue of £9,056,000 in the financial 
year 1 907-1 908. The gross public debt had reached £66,500,000 
in 1908. The money has chiefly been spent on railways, tele- 
graphs, roads, bridges, land purchase from the native tribes 
and private estate owners, on loans to settlers and on native 
wars. The state railways (2500 m.) return about £800,000 after 
paying working expenses. This does not quite defray the 
interest on the cost of their construction and equipment, inas- 
much as it barely comes to $\% thereon, but rates and fares 
are deliberately "kept low to encourage settlement and com- 
munication. The debts of the local bodies amount to about 
nine millions. They raise rather more than a million a year 
by rates, licence fees and dues. _ 

Education^ — Under the Education Act of 1 877 state schools are 
established, in which teaching is free, secular and compulsory, with 
certain exceptions, _ for children between the ages of seven and 
thirteen. A capitation grant is given for every child in average daily 
attendance at the schools. Grants are also made for scholarships 
from primary to secondary schools, for training institutions for 
teachers and for school buildings. Large reserves of public lands 
have been made for primary, secondary and university education. 
All primary and some secondary public schools are controlled by 
provincial education boards elected by school committees of the 
parents of pupils. The percentage of attendance has rivalled that in 
the primary schools of Scotland, and in 1905 attained to 86-9%. 
Native village schools are also provided by the state in native 
districts. There are, moreover, industrial schools, orphanages and 
> institutions for the deaf and dumb and blind. There are about 
ninety secondary schools, state-supported or aided by public endow- 
ments. The university of New Zealand is an examining body, and 
grants honours, degrees and scholarships. It is empowered by 
royal charter to confer degrees entitled to rank and consideration 
throughout the British dominions, as fully as if they were granted by 
any university in the United Kingdom. Colleges in the four chief 
towns and in Nelson are affiliated to the New Zealand University, 
which has about fifteen hundred undergraduates keeping terms. 
The state in no way controls or interferes with religious administra- 
tion. Each denomination attends to the religious instruction of its 
own adherents, chiefly by means of Sunday schools, which count 
108,000 pupils. Roman Catholics support about 150 clerical day 
schools attended by about 11,500 scholars. State school buildings 
can be, and sometimes are, used for religious instruction on days and 
at hours oth,er than those fixed by law for ordinary school work; 
but no child can be required to attend, except at the wish of its parent 
or guardian. The government spends £35.000 a year on manual and 
technical instruction, a branch of teaching which includes about 
two hundred cookery classes. A school of engineering and an agri- 
cultural college are attached to the university 'college in the province 
of Canterbury, and there are several schools of mines elsewhere. 

About 157,000 white children and 6500 Maori children attend 
schools "of one degree or another. Private schools claim about 10% 
of these. The annual parliamentary expenditure on education 
exceeds^ £700,000. In this connexion it may be claimed that the 
proportion of policemen to population (1 to 1375) is lower in New 
Zealand than in any other colony. The fixing of the legal minimum 
" factory age " for children at fourteen undoubtedly favours school 
attendance. 

Land. — Apart from gold-mining, coal-mining and gum-digging, 
the industries are still mainly the growing of food and raw material; 
and the occupation of the land is easily the chief of all economic 
questions. Sixteen million acres were in 1907 already held in free- 
hold, as against about six million acres rented from the state on 
permanent leasehold. Crown lands are still alienated, though but 
little is now sold for cash outright. The number of holdings of one 
acre and upwards in size rose from 33,332 in 1886 to 58,904 in 1896, 
and 72,338 in 1906; but the area held in estates of 5000 acres and 
upwards remains very large and has diminished but slowly despite 
the severity of the graduated land-tax. Many interesting experi- 
ments in settling lands have been tried. The best known of these, 
perhaps, is the repurchase of large pastoral estates for subdivision 
and lease in perpetuity. In the fourteen years 1 893-1907 about a 
million and a quarter acres were thus acquired at a cost of somewhat 
under five millions and a halt. Over 13,000 souls had been settled in 
this area, and the yearly rent received from them, about £220,000, 
lett a substantial balance to the credit of the enterprise in the books 
of the treasury. The tenants (who had been favoured with good 
years) were with very few exceptions prospering. 

Old Age Pensions. — The Old Age Pensions law, enacted in 1898, 
provided for the free grant of pensions, not exceeding £18 a year, 
to persons of sixty-five years and upwards who had lived for twenty- 
five years in the colony. Pensioners must be British subjects, poor, 
and not ex-criminals or of notoriously bad character. In 1905 the 
maximum pension was raised to £26 a year. Official figures show 
that the total number of applications for pensions up to that date 
had been 31,271, of which 23,877 had been granted. The number 
of pensioners then on the books of the Pensions Office was 13,257. 
In the first three years after enactment of the law the growth of 
the number of pensioners was very rapid; in the next five it was 
remarkably slow— only 481 altogether. The proportion of whites 
qualified by age and residence who were actually drawing pensions 
was rather less than one-third (it had been 9% more in 1902). The 
reduction was due to stricter administration t> The total sum paid 
out in eight and a quarter years had been a million and three quarters. 
The amount paid in pensions in the financial year 1906- 1907 was 
£325,000. The money is found by the central government. The 
administration of the system, which is in the hands of a special 
department, costs a little over £5000. Frauds and evasions by 
applicants and pensioners, though they exist, are not believed to 
be numerous. Public thrift does not, so far, seem to have been 
diminished. Since the coming of the system the amount spent on 
outdoor relief in the colony had by 1906 diminished from £51,000 
to £36,500, in face of an increase of nearly 23% in the population. 

History. — The date, even the approximate date, of man's 
arrival in New Zealand is uncertain. All tha't can be safely 
asserted is that by the 14th century a.d. Polynesian canoe-men 
had reached its northern shores in successive voyages. By 
1642 they had spread to South Island, for there Abel Jansen 
Tasman found them when, in the course of his circuitous voyage 
from Java in the" Heemskirk," he chanced upon the archipelago, 
coasted along much of its western side, though without venturing 
to land, and gave it the name it still bears. One hundred and 
thirty-seven years later, Cook, in the harque " Endeavour," 
gained a much fuller knowledge of the coasts, which he circum- 
navigated, visited again and again, and mapped out with fair 
accuracy. He annexed the country, but the British government 
disavowed the act. After him came other navigators, French, 
Spanish, Russian and American; and, as the 18th century 
neared its end, came sealers, whalers and trading-schooners 
in quest of flax and timber. English missionaries, headed by 
Samuel Marsden, landed in 1814, to make for many years but 
slow progress. They were hindered by murderous tribal wars 
in which imported muskets more than decimated the Maori. 
Still, cruel experience and the persevering preaching of the 
missionaries gradually checked the fighting, and by the year 
1839 it could be claimed that peace and Christianity were in 
the ascendant. So far the British government had resisted the 
considerable pressure brought to bear in Downing Street in 
favour of annexation. In vain Edward Gibbon Wakefield, 
organizer of colonizing associations, prayed and intrigued for 
permission to repeat in New Zealand the experiment tried by 
him in South Australia. Lord Glenelg, the colonial minister, had 
the support of the missionaries in withstanding Wakefield's 
New Zealand Company, which at length resolved in desperation 
to send an agent to buy land wholesale in New Zealand and 
despatch a shipload of settlers thither without official permission. 
Before, however, the " Tory " had thus sailed for Cook Strait, 
it had become known to the English government that a French 
colonizing company — La Compagni-e Nanto-Bordelaise — was 
forming, under the auspices of Louis Philippe, to anticipate or 
oust Wakefield. Further obstruction was manifestly futile, and 
the British authorities reluctantly instructed Captain Hobson, 
R.N., to make his way to northern New Zealand with a dormant 
commission of lieutenant-governor in his pocket and authority 
to annex the country to Australia by peaceful arrangement with 
the natives. Hobson landed in the Bay of Islands on the 22nd 
of January 1840, hoisted the Union Jack, and had little difficulty 
in inducing most of the native chiefs to accept the queen's 
sovereignty at the price of guaranteeing to the tribes by the 
treaty of Waitangi possession of their lands, forests and fisheries. 
Some French settlers, convoyed by a man-of-war, reached 
Akaroa in South Island in the May following. But Hobson had 
forestalled them, and those who remained in the country became 
British subjects. Meanwhile, a week after Hobson's arrival, 
Wakefield's colonists had sailed into Port Nicholson, and proposed 
to take possession of immense tracts which the New Zealand 
Company claimed to have bought from the natives, and for which 
colonists had in good faith paid the company. Other bands of 
company's settlers in like manner landed at Nelson, Wanganui 
and New Plymouth, to be met with the news that the British 
government would not recognize the company's purchases. 
Then followed weary years of ruinous delay and official inquiry, 
during which Hobson died after founding Auckland. His 
successor, Fitzroy, drifted into* an unsuccessful native war. 
A strong man, Captain Grey, was at last sent over from Australia 
to restore peace and rescue the unhappy colony from bankruptcy 
and despair. Grey, much the best of the absolute governors, 
held the balance fairly between the white and brown races, and 
bought large tracts of land for colonization, including the whole 
South Island, where the Presbyterian settlement of Otago and 
the Anglican settlement of Canterbury were established by 
the persevering Wakefield. 

In 1852 the mother-country granted self-government, and, 
after much wrangling and hesitation, a full parliamentary system 
and a responsible ministry were set going in 1856. For twenty 
years thereafter the political history of the colony consisted 
of two long, intermittent struggles — one constitutional between 
the central government (first seated in Auckland, but after 
1864 in Wellington) and the powerful provincial councils, of 
which there were nine charged with important functions and 
endowed with the land revenues and certain rating powers. 
The other prolonged contest was racial — the conflict between 
settler and Maori. The native tribes, brave, intelligent and 
fairly well armed, tried, by means of a league against land-selling 
and the election of a king, to retain their hold over at least the 
central North Island. But their kings were incompetent, their 
chiefs jealous and their tribes divided. Their style of warfare, 
too, caused them to throw away the immense advantages which 
the broken bush-clad island offered to clever guerrilla partisans. 
They were poor marksmen, and had but little skill in laying 
ambuscades. During ten years of intermittent marching and 
fighting between 1861 and 187 1 the Maori did no more than 
prove that they had in them the stuff to stand up against fearful 
odds and not always to be worsted. Round Mount Egmont, 
at Orakau, at Tauranga and in the Wanganui jungles, they more 
than once held their own against British regiments and colonial 
riflemen. The storming of their favourite positions — stockades 
strengthened with rifle-pits — was often costly; and a strange 
anti-Christian fanaticism, the Hau-Hau cult, encouraged them 
to face the white men's bullets and bayonets. But even their 
fiercest fighting leaders, Rewi and Te Kooti, scarcely deserved 
the name of generals. Some of the best Maori fighters, such as 
the chiefs Ropata and K$mp, were enlisted on the white side, 
and with their tribesmen did much to make unequal odds still 
more unequal. Had General Pratt or General Cameron, who 
commanded the imperial forces from i860 to 1865, had the 
rough vigour of their successor, General Chute, or the cleverness 
of Sir George Grey, the war might have ended in 1864. Even 
as it was the resistance of the Maori was utterly worn out 
at last. After 187 1 they fought no more. The colonists too, 
taught by the sickening delay and the ruinous cost of the war 
to revert to conciliatory methods, had by this time granted the 
natives special representation in parliament- A tactful native 
minister, Sir Donald McLean, did the rest. Disarmament, 
roads and land-purchasing enabled settlement to make headway 
again in the North Island after twelve years of stagnation. 
Grey quarrelled with his masters in Downing Street, and his 
career in the imperial service came to an end in 1868. His 
successors, Sir George Bowen, Sir James Ferguson, the marquess 
of Normanby and Sir Hercules Robinson, were content to be 
constitutional governors and to respect strictly the behests of 
the colonial office. Meanwhile the industrial story of New 
Zealand may be summed up in the words wool and gold. Ex- 
tremely well suited for sheep-farming, the natural pastures of 
the country were quickly parcelled out into huge pastoral crown 
leases, held by prosperous licensees, the squatters, who in many 
cases aspired to become a country gentry by turning their leases 
into freeholds. So profitable was sheep-farming seen to be that 
energetic settlers began to burn off the bracken and cut and burn 
the forest in the North Island and sow English grasses on the 
cleared land. In the South artificial grassing went on for a time 
hand in hand with cereal-growing, which by 1876 seemed likely 
to develop on a considerable scale, thanks to the importation 
of American agricultural machinery, which the settlers were 
quick to utilize. Even more promising appeared the gold-fields. 
Gold had been discovered in 1853. Not, however, until 1861 
was a permanent field found — that lighted upon by Gabriel 
Read at Tuapeka in Otago. Thereafter large deposits were 
profitably exploited in the south and west of South Island and 
in the Thames and Coromandel districts of the Auckland province. 
Gold-mining went through the usual stages of alluvial washing, 
deep sinking and quartz-reef working. Perhaps its chief value 
was that it brought many thousand diggers to the colony, 
most of whom stayed there. Pastoral and mining enterprise, 
however, could not save the settlers from severe depression in 
the years 1867 to 1871. War had brought progress in the north 
to a standstill; in the south wool-growing and gold-mining 
showed their customary fluctuations. For a moment it seemed 
as though the manufacture of hemp from the native Phormium 
tenax would become a great industry. But that suddenly 
collapsed, to the ruin of many, and did not revive for a number 
of years. 

In 1870 peace had not yet been quite won; industry was 
depressed; and the scattered and scanty colonists already 
owed seven millions sterling. Yet it was at this moment that 
a political financier, Sir Julius Vogel, at that moment colonial 
treasurer in the ministry of Sir William Fox, audaciously pro- 
posed that the central government should borrow ten millions, 
make roads and railways, buy land from the natives and import 
British immigrants. The House of Representatives, at first 
aghast, presently voted four millions as a beginning. Coinciding 
as the carrying out of Vogel's policy did with a rising wool 
market, it for a time helped to bring great prosperity, an influx 
of people and much genuine settlement. Fourteen millions 
of borrowed money, spent in ten years, were on the whole well 
laid out. But prosperity brought on a feverish land speculation; 
prices of wool and wheat fell in 1879 and went on falling. Faulty 
banking ended in a crisis, and 1879 proved to be the first of sixteen 
years of almost unbroken depression. Still, eight prosperous 
years had radically changed the colony. Peace, railways, 
telegraphs (including cable connexion with Europe), agricultural 
machinery and a larger population had carried New Zealand 
beyond the primitive stage. The provincial councils had been 
swept away in 1876, and their functions divided between the 
central authority and small powerless local bodies. Politics, 
cleared of the cross-issues of provincialism and Maori warfare, 
took the usual shape of a struggle between wealth and radicalism. 
Sir George Grey, entering colonial politics as a Radical leader, 
had appealed eloquently to the work-people as well as to the 
Radical " intellectuals," and though unable to retain office for 
very long he had compelled his opponents to pass manhood 
suffrage and a triennial parliaments act. A national education 
system, free, non-religious and compulsory, was established in 
1877. The socialistic bent of New Zealand was already dis- 
cernible in a public trustee law and a state life insurance office. 
But the socialistic labour wave of later years had not yet gathered 
strength. Grey proved himself a poor financier and a tactless 
party leader. A land-tax imposed by his government helped 
to alarm the farmers. The financial collapse of 1879 left the 
treasury empty. Grey was manoeuvred out of office, and Sir John 
Hall and Sir Harry Atkinson, able opponents, took the reins 
with a mission to reinstate the finances and restore confidence. 

Roughly speaking, both the political and the industrial 
history of the colony from 1879 to 1908 may be divided into two 
periods. The dividing line, however, has to be drawn in different 
years. Sixteen years of depression were followed, from 1895 
to 1908, by thirteen years of great prosperity. In politics 
nearly twelve years of Conservative government, or at least 
capitalistic predominance in public affairs, were succeeded by 
more than seventeen years of Radicalism. Up to January 
1891 the Conservative forces which overthrew Sir George Grey 
in 1879 controlled the country in effect though not always in 
name, and for ten years progressive legislation was confined to 
a mild experiment in offering crown lands on perpetual lease, 
with a right of purchase (1882), a still milder instalment of local 
option (1881) and an inoffensive Factories Act (1886). In 
September 1889, however, Sir George Grey succeeded in getting 
parliament to abolish the last remnant of plural voting. Finance 
otherwise absorbed attention; by 1880 the public debt had 
reached £25,000,000, against which the chief new asset was 
1300 m. of railway, and though the population had increased 
to nearly half a million, the revenue was stagnant. A severe 
property-tax and an increase of customs duties in 1879 only for a 
moment achieved financial equilibrium. Although taxation 
was seconded by a drastic, indeed harsh, reduction of public 
salaries and wages (which were cut down by one-tenth all round) 
yet the years 1884, 1887 and 1888 were notable for heavy 
deficits in the treasury. Taxation, direct and indirect, had to 
be further increased, and as a means of gaining support for this 
in 1888 Sir Harry Atkinson, who was responsible for the budget, 
gave the customs tariff a distinctly protectionist complexion. 

During the years 1 879-1 890 the leading political personage 
was Sir Harry Atkinson. He, however, withdrew from party 
politics when, in December 1890, he was overthrown by the 
Progressives under John Baliance. Atkinson's party never 
rallied from this defeat, and a striking change came over public 
life, though Baliance, until his death in April 1893, continued 
the prudent financial policy of his predecessor. The change 
was emphasized by the active intervention in politics of the 
trade unions. These bodies decided in 1889 and 1890 to exert 
their influence in returning workmen to parliament, and where 
this was impossible, to secure pledges from middle-class candi- 
dates. This plan was first put into execution at the general 
election of 1890, which was held during the industrial excitement 
aroused by the Australasian maritime strike of that year. It 
had, however, been fully arranged before the conflict broke out. 
The number of labour members thus elected to the general 
assembly was small, never more than six, and no independent 
labour party of any size was formed. But the influence of labour 
in the Progressive or, as it preferred to be called, Liberal party, 
was considerable, and the legislative results noteworthy. Baliance 
at once raised the pay of members from £150 to £240 a year, but 
otherwise directed his energies to constitutional reforms and 
social experiments. These did not interfere with the general 
lines of Atkinson's strong and cautious finance, though the first 
of them was the abolition of his direct tax upon all property, 
personal as well as real, and the substitution therefor of a land- 
tax of id. in the £ on capital value, and also of a graduated tax 
upon unimproved land values, and an income-tax also graduated, 
though less elaborately. The graduated land-tax, which has 
since been stiffened, rises from nothing at all upon the smaller 
holdings to 3d. in the £ upon the capital value of the largest 
estates — those worth £2 10,000 and upwards. Buildings, improve- 
ments, and live stock are exempted. In the case of mortgaged 
estates the mortgagor is exempted from ordinary land-tax in 
proportion to the amount of his mortgage. On that the mortgagee 
pays at the rate of Jd. in the £. In 1896 municipal and rural 
local bodies were allowed to levy rates upon unimproved land 
values if authorized to do so by a vote of their electors, and by 
the end of 1901 some sixty bodies, amongst them the city of 
Wellington, had made use of this permission. The income-tax 
is not levied on incomes drawn from land. In 1891 the tenure 
of members of the legislative council or nominated Upper House, 
which had hitherto been for life, was altered to seven years. 
In 1892 a new form of land tenure was introduced, under which 
large areas of crown lands were leased for 999 years, at an 
unchanging rent of 4% on the prairie value. Crown tenants 
under this system had no right of purchase. In the same year 
a law was also passed authorizing government to repurchase 
private land for closer settlement. 

On Ballance's sudden death in April 1893 his place was taken 
by Richard Seddon, minister of mines in the Baliance cabinet, 
whose first task was to pass the electoral bill of his predecessor, 
which granted the franchise to all adult women. This was adopted 
in September 1893, though the majority for it in the Upper 
House was but two votes. In 1893 was enacted the Alcoholic 
Liquor Control Act, greatly extending local option. In 1894 
was passed the Advances to Settlers Act, under which state 
money-lending to farmers on mortgage of freehold or leasehold 
land was at once begun. The money is lent by an official board, 
which deals with applications and manages the finance of the 
system. In thirteen years the board lent out over five millions 
and a half, and received repayment of nearly two millions of 
principal as well as over one million in interest at 5 %. Borrowers 
must repay J% of their principal half-yearly, and may repay as 
much more as they choose. Profits are paid over to an assurance 
fund. No losses were incurred during the thirteen years above 
mentioned. The net profit made by the board in 1006 was 
£45,000. The same year also saw the climax of a series of laws 
passed by the Progressives affecting the relations of employers 
and workmen. These laws deal with truck, employers' liability, 
contractors' workmen, the recovery of workmen's wages, the hours 
of closing in shops and merchants' offices, conspiracy amongst 
trade unionists, and with factories, mines, shipping and seamen. 
In 1895 a law controlling servants' registry offices was added. 
In 1897 all shipowners engaging in the coasting trade of the colony 
were compelled to pay the colonial rate of wages. 

Meanwhile the keystone of the regulative system had been laid 
by the passing of the Industrial Conciliation and Arbitration Act, 
under which disputes between employers and unions of workers 
are compulsorily settled by state tribunals; strikes and lock-outs 
are virtually prohibited in the case of organized work-people, and 
the conditions of employment in industries may be, and in many 
cases are, regulated by public boards and courts. The years 
1896,1897 and 1898 were marked by struggles over the Old Age 
Pensions Bill, which became law in November 1898. In 1898 the 
divorce law was amended on the lines of the Stephen Act of New 
South Wales, a change which helped to treble the number of 
petitions for divorce in the next seven years. In 1898 also the 
municipal franchise, hitherto confined to ratepayers, was greatly 
widened; in 1900 the English system of compensation to work- 
men for accidents suffered in their trade was adopted with some 
changes, one of the chief being that contested claims are adjudi- 
cated upon cheaply and expeditiously by the same arbitration 
court that decides industrial disputes. In 1895 borrowing on 
a larger scale was begun, and in twelve years, twice as many 
millions were added to the public debt. Before this the Ballance 
ministry bad organized two new departments, those of labour 
and agriculture. The former supervises the labour laws and 
endeavours to deal with unemployment; the latter has done 
much practical teaching, inspection, &c. Butter, cheese and 
New Zealand hemp are by law graded and branded by depart- 
mental inspectors before export. For some years the government 
has worked two coal-mines profitably, chiefly to supply its 
railways. In 1907 the net profit on these was over £8000. The 
continued success of the government life insurance office led 
in 1899 to the setting up of an accidents insurance office, and, 
in 1903, of a state fire insurance office. 

The outbreak of the Boer War in October 1899 was followed 
in New Zealand by a prompt display of general and persistent 
warlike enthusiasm: politics ceased to be the chief topic of 
interest; the general election of 1899 was the most languid held 
for fifteen years. The desire of New Zealanders to strike a blow 
for the mother-country took the practical shape of despatching 
to South Africa ten successive contingents. 

After gaining office at the beginning of 1891 the Ballance- 
Seddon party had to struggle with the last four years of the 
period of depression. In 1895 began a marked commercial 
revival, mainly due to the steady conversion of the colony's 
waste lands into pasture; the development of frozen meat and 
dairy exports; the continuous increase of the output of coal; 
the invention of gold-dredging; the revival and improvement 
of hemp manufacture; the exploiting of the deposits of kauri 
gum; the reduction in the rates of interest on mortgage money; 
a general rise in wages, obtained without strikes, and partially 
secured by law, which has increased the spending power of the 
working classes. Undoubtedly also commercial confidence was 
restored by the reconstruction in 1895 of the Bank of New Zea- 
land, and activity has been stimulated by large pubjic loans, 
.while more cautious banking and the systems of taxation and 
rating on land values, adopted in 1891 and 1896, have done 
something to check land speculation. 

Between 1879 and 1908 seven governors represented the crown 
in New Zealand. Of these Sir Hercules Robinson and Sir Arthur 
Gordon had but brief reigns; Sir Arthur Gordon quitted the 
colony in June 1882. His successor, Sir William Drummond 
Jervois, arrived in January 1883, and held office until March 1889. 
The earl of Onslow, who followed, landed in June 1889, and 
resigned in February 1892. The next governor, the earl of 
Glasgow, remained in the colony from June 1892 to February 
1897, and was succeeded in August of the last-mentioned year 
by the earl of Ranfurly, who did not retire until 1904. His place 
was then taken by Lord Plunket. The cabinets which adminis- 
tered the affairs of the colony during these years were those of 
Sir Frederick Whitaker, Sir Harry Atkinson (3), Sir Robert 
Stout (2), Mr Ballance, Mr Seddon, Mr Hall-Jones and Sir Joseph 
Ward. Mr Hall- Jones's short premiership was an interregnum 
made necessary by the absence of Sir Joseph Ward in England 
at the moment of Mr Seddon's death. Except in one disturbed 
month, August 1884, when there were three changes of ministry 
in eighteen days, executives were more stable than in the colony's 
earlier years. The party headed by Ballance, Seddon and Ward 
held office without a break for more than seventeen years, a result 
mainly due to the general support given to its agrarian and 
labour policy by the smaller farmers and the working classes. 
Sir Arthur Gordon differed from his ministers— Hall and Atkinson 
— on their native policy. Lords Onslow and Glasgow came into 
collision with Ballance over a proposal to nominate a large batch 
of Liberals to the then Conservative legislative council. The 
dispute was by consent referred to the secretary for the colonies, 
and the decision from Downing Street was in Ballance's favour. 

The governor's salary, reduced in 1887, was restored to £7500 
a year in 1900. An Immigrants Exclusion Act voted by the 
general assembly in 1896 did not receive the royal assent; but, 
by arrangement with the colonial office, another measure, giving 
power to impose a reading test on aliens landing in the colony, 
became law in 1899. 

The presence of New Zealand premiers at the imperial con- 
ferences in London in 1897, 1903 and 1907 helpep 1 to bring the 
colony into conscious touch with imperial public questions. 
Among the results were the increase of the naval contribution 
(first to £40,000 and then, in 1908, to £100,000), and the im- 
position in 1903 and again in 1007 of severe discriminating duties 
against imports from foreign countries.

NEXT FRIEND, in law, the phrase used for a person who 
represents in an action another person who is under disability 
to maintain a suit on his own behalf. This disability arises from 
infancy or mental incapacity, consequently every application 
to the court on behalf of an infant or a lunatic must be made 
through a next friend (prochein amy, proximus amicus). Previous 
to the Married Women's Property Act 1882 it was also usual 
for a married woman to sue by a next friend, but that act, 
allowing a married woman to sue in all respects as a feme sole, 
has rendered a next friend unnecessary in her case. In the case 
of an infant the father is prima facie the proper person to act 
as next friend; in the father's absence the testamentary guardian 
if any; but any person not under disability may act as next 
friend so long as he has no interest in the action adverse to that 
of the infant. A married woman cannot, however, act as next 
friend. An infant defends a suit, not by a next friend, but by 
a guardian ad litem. In the case of a lunatic, he sues by his 
committee, but if he has no committee, or if the committee has 
some interest adverse to the lunatic, he sues by his next friend. 
A next friend has full power over the proceedings in the action 
as if he were an ordinary plaintiff, but he is not entitled to be 
heard in person. 


NEY, MICHEL, duke of Elchingen, prince of the Moskowa 
(1760-1815), marshal of France, was born at Saarlouis on the 
10th of January 1769. His father was a cooper, and he received 
only a rudimentary education. In 1788 he went to Metz and 
enlisted in a regiment of hussars; in 1792 he was elected 
lieutenant; and in 1794 he became captain and was placed by 
Kleber at the head of a special corps of light troops. He was soon 
promoted cliejde brigade, and in 1 796, after repeatedly distinguish- 
ing himself in action, general of brigade. He then commanded 
the right wing of Hoche's army up to the peace of Campo Formio. 
On the resumption of hostilities he again took the field, and for 
his surprise of Mannheim in 1 799 received the grade of general 
of division. He distinguished himself and received three wounds 
in the Swiss campaign of Massena, and when Massena turned 
against the Russians, who were approaching from Italy, Ney 
was left in command of the holding detachment opposite the 
Austrians. He displayed great vigour and skill in this work, 
and was completely successful, although his opponent was 
the famous Archduke Charles. In 1800 he was present at 
Hohenlinden. In May 1802 he married Mademoiselle Auguie, 
whom Josephine had chosen for him at Bonaparte's request. 
This event marks a change in Ney's political opinions which can 
only be explained by reference to Napoleon's power of captivating 
men. He was henceforward as ardent and sincere an admirer 
of Napoleon as hitherto he had been of revolutionary principles, 
and was one of the very few officers of the Army of the Rhine 
who became a trusted lieutenant of the emperor. He soon 
afterwards carried out an important diplomatic mission in 
Switzerland, and in 1803 he was placed in command of the camp 
of Montreuil. It was while there that, in the name of the army, 
he begged Napoleon to declare himself emperor, and on the 
establishment of the empire he was made marshal of France, 
and received the grand eagle of the Legion of Honour. In 1805 
he commanded the VI. corps of the Grand Army, and his great 
victory at Elchingen (for which in 1808 he was made duke of 
Elchingen) practically secured the surrender of the Austrians 
at Ulm. He was then ordered to the upper Adige, and missed 
the battle of Austerlitz, but was present at Jena and Eylau and 
led the decisive attack at Friedland. His reputation for personal 
heroism was by now at its height, and after Friedland Napoleon 
gave him the title by which he is still known, " the bravest of 
the brave." 

In 1808, after the first disaster to the French arms in Spain, 
Ney accompanied Napoleon thither as commander of the VI. 
corps. He took part in the Peninsular War from 1808 to 1811, 
commanding his corps in Napoleon's own operations of 1808-09, 
in the irregular operations in Galicia 1809-10, and under Massena 
in the invasion of Portugal in 1810-11. In the last, however, 
he quarrelled bitterly with his former chief, and although he 
distinguished himself very greatly in command of the rearguard 
during the retreat from Torres Vedras — notably at Redinha — 
he was recalled to France by Napoleon and censured for his 
indiscipline. Almost immediately, however, he was re-employed 
with the Grande Arm&e in central Europe under Napoleon himself. 
In the 1812 expedition to Russia Ney commanded the centre 
at Borodino, and was created prince of the Moskowa on the 
evening of the victory. In the retreat he was a tower of strength, 
animating the rearguard with his own sublime courage, keeping 
the harassed and famished soldiers together under the colours 
and personally standing in the ranks with musket and bayonet. 
He himself was the last to recross the frontier, and threw the 
remaining muskets into the Niemen. In 1813 he commanded 
a corps in the German campaign, fought at Liitzen, Bautzen, 
Dennewitz and Leipzig, and in 1814 he shared in the victories 
and defeats of the campaign in France. At the fall of the Empire 
Ney was neither the first nor the last of the marshals to give 
up the struggle, but that he acted in the negotiations in concert 
with Macdonald and Caulaincourt is sufficient proof of his desire 
to avert the unreserved abdication that was forced upon Napoleon 
by other circumstances. Less satisfactory than his conduct at 
this crisis was his loud protestation of devotion to the Bourbons, 
when the Restoration was a fait accompli. But he was soon 
mortified by the disdain of the returned imigres, and retired 
to his country seat. While on his way thence to take up a 
command at Besancon, he learned of the return of Napoleon. 
He hurried at once to pay his respects to Louis XVIII. and to 
assure him of his fidelity. With the famous remark that the 
usurper ought to be brought to Paris in an iron cage, he proceeded 
to Lons-le-Saulnier to bar Napoleon's progress. But instead 
of doing so, he deserted with his troops, and Napoleon's march 
became a triumphal progress. Ney's act was undeniably 
treason to his sovereign, but it was hardly the calculated treason 
that his imigrt detractors saw fit to imagine. The first violence 
of his language, his ineffective efforts to make constitutional 
guarantees the price of his adhesion to Napoleon, and his final 
surrender to the dominant personality of his old leader, all show 
him to have been " out of his depth " in this political crisis. 
Napoleon received him kindly, but did not give him a command 
at first. But when the Waterloo campaign was about to begin 
he summoned Ney to the northern frontier. The marshal 
gladly obeyed and took up the command of the left wing on 
June 13. The next day the army moved into Belgium. Ney 
took part in the campaign successively in the r61es of strategist, 
tactician and soldier (see Waterloo Campaign). Much con- 
troversy has raged over his actions of the 15th and 16th of June. 
At Waterloo he was of course subordinated to the personal com- 
mand of Napoleon, but his advice as to the conduct of the battle 
was often offered and sometimes accepted, and he personally led 
several charges of the French up to the British squares. But 
when all was lost, his courage, instead of burning brightly as 
in the Moscow retreat, was extinguished. He made no attempt 
to second Davout and Grouchy in the last days of Napoleon's 
reign, and in despair advocated the restoration of the Bourbons. 
Finding that Louis XVIII. and his allies ignored his advances, 
he resolved to escape from France, but afterwards, believing 
himself protected by the terms of the convention concluded 
on the 3rd of June, he gave up the idea. Soon a fresh order was 
issued denouncing him by name, and after a half-hearted attempt 
to conceal himself he was arrested on the 5th of August. King 
Louis and his minister Decazes realized to the full the lasting 
unpopularity that would fall on the monarchy in consequence^ 
they had done their best to facilitate the escape of the " traitors " ; 
and when Louis heard of Ney's arrest he exclaimed, "By letting 
himself be caught he has done us more harm than he did on the 
13th of March!" But neither king nor ministers were in a 
position to resist the clamour of the ultra-royalists for blood. 
Every fresh delay in the process of Ney's trial raised a new 
outcry at the court, in the salons and in the Chamber of Deputies; 
and fiercest of all in demanding immediate execution was the 
king's niece, the unhappy duchess of Angouleme, who lived 
to confess that had she known the record of Ney's services to 
France she would never have consented to his death. The 
king was powerless against this all but unanimous voice of 
royalist opinion, backed as it was by that of the powers to whom 
he owed his crown. Ney was placed on trial before a court- 
martial composed chiefly of his former brothers-in-arms, whose 
participation in the tragedy, slight as it was, was probably 
never forgiven them by their countrymen. Others of the 
marshal's old comrades refused to serve, and were disgraced 
in consequence, until public opinion forced their reinstatement. 
The court, once assembled, was only too glad to take advantage 
of the plea of Ney's counsel that he was entitled to be tried by 
his equals in the Chamber of Peers. In spite of the courageous 
and eloquent appeal of the young due de Broglie, the result 
of the trial before the latter body was a foregone conclusion; 
as to Ney's treason there could be no doubt, and de Broglie 
was alone in voting for his acquittal. In the early morning of 
the 7th of December 181 5 Ney was shot in the Luxembourg 
gardens, near the Observatory. He met his death quietly and 
with a perfect soldierly dignity that effaced the memory of his 
political extravagances, and made him, next to Napoleon himself, 
the most heroic figure of the time. Much has been said as to 
the share of the duke of Wellington in the trial and execution, 
and, rightly or wrongly, he has been blamed for allowing the 
Bourbons, when restored by the foreign bayonets that he con- 
trolled, to proscribe the soldiers who as soldiers had been included 
in the military capitulation to the Allies. 

Ney left materials for memoirs, but in an incomplete state. The 
Mimoires du marichal Ney, published in 1833, were collected from 
these papers by his brother-in-law Gamot and by General Foy. 
They cover only the earlier part of his career, and end with the battle 
of Elchingen (October 1805). An edition in English was published 
the same year.

NEZ PERCYS (in allusion to their custom of wearing nose- 
rings, &c), a tribe of North American Indians of Sahaptian 
stock. They call themselves Shaptin (whence the stock name) 
but to other tribes were known as Chopunnish. Their former 
range was a large tract in eastern Washington and Oregon and 
central Idaho. Until i877theyhadbeenat peace with the whites. 
In 1875 a portion of their reservation having been taken from 
them, owing to the allegation that they had not carried out the 
treaty stipulations, difficulties arose which, two years later, 
caused the Nez Perces War. The disaffected portion of the tribe, 
numbering some 400 or 500, held out for several months against 
all the forces the government could bring up, but were finally 
captured on the Sweet Grass Hills, northern Montana. They 
were placed in Indian Territory, but in 1884 transferred, owing 
to their decrease through disease,to a healthier locality in northern 
Washington. The main tribe are on a reservation in northern 
Idaho. 


NGAMI, the central point of an inland water system of South 
Africa, once forming a lake 20 m. long and 10 wide, but now 
little more than an expanse of reeds growing in a soft treacherous 
soil, below which brackish water is found. It is cut by 2o§° S. 
and 23 E. Ngami is the lowest point of a large depression in 
the plateau which comprises nine-tenths of Africa south of the 
Zambezi. The area which drains to it is bounded S. by the basin 
of the Orange, E. by the Matabele hills, N. by the western affluents 
of the Zambezi. The greater part of the Ngami water-system 
lies, however, N. W. of the lake (which for convenience it may still 
be called) in the tableland of Angola and German South West 
Africa. On the high plateau of Bihe, in the hinterland of 
Benguella, rise two large rivers, the Okavango and the Kwito, 
which uniting discharged their waters into Ngami. From the 
N.E. end of Ngami issued the Botletle or Zuga, a stream which 
runs S.E. and drains towards the Makarikari marsh, from which 
there is no outlet. 

Although Ngami has dried up since 1890 the Okavango and 
its tributary the Kwito remain large rivers. The Okavango 
is known in its upper course as the Kubango. Its most remote 
source lies in about 12J S. and i6£° E. and its length is over 
900 m. It flows first S. then S.E. and E. In about 18 S. and 
2o|° E. it is joined on the north bank by the Kwito, a large 
navigable stream rising almost as far north as the Okavango. 
Its general course is S.E., but between 15 and 17 S. it flows 
S. and even S.W. Below the Kwito confluence the Okavango, 
which is also joined by various streams from the S.W. (German 
territory), is a rapid stream with an average breadth of over 100 
yds., and generally navigable as far as the Popa falls, in 21 50' 
E. In the dry season, the water-level is from 4 to 20 ft. below 
the banks, but these are overflowed during the rains. At this 
period, April- June, some of the surplus water finds its way (in 
about 1 9 S.) hy the Magwekwana to the Kwando or Linyanti 
(Zambezi system), to which, it is conjectured, the whole body 
of water may have once flowed. Below the Magwekwana outlet 
the Okavango, now called the Taukhe or Tioghe, turns almost 
due S., enters a swampy reed-covered plain and is broken into 
several branches. In this region the effects of desiccation are 
marked. Through the swamps the river formerly entered Ngami. 

The last 20 m. of the old channel are now dry and devoted to 
grain crops. Ahove this point the waters of the Okavango are 
diverted eastward through a channel called Tamalakane to the 
Botletle, the river which, as stated above, formerly flowed out 
of Ngami. The point of confluence is in about 20 S. 23^° E., 
the Botletle above this point being merely a succession of pools. 
Below the junction the river bed is 150 to 200 yds. wide. The 
banks are 25 to 30 ft. high, and form steep white walls of sand 
compacted with lime, behind which the dark green forest rises. 
The stream is fringed with reeds harbouring countless water- 
fowl. The Botletle, whose bed is about 100 m. in length, loses 
itself in a system of salt-pans — round or oval basins of varying 
size sunk to a depth of 30 to 45 ft. in the sandstone, and often 
bounded by steep banks. The outer pans are dry for a large 
part of the year, the whole system being filled only at the height 
of the flood-season in August. The Botletle, which receives in 
addition the scanty waters of the northern Kalahari, at this 
season reaches the Makarikari marsh. This marsh, occupying 
the N.E. corner of Bechuanaland, has also feeders from the 
Matabele hills in the direction of Bulawayo. During the rains 
the marsh is converted into a large lake. Much of the water is 
lost by evaporation; much of it sinks into some subterranean 
reservoir. 

The evidence ot travellers is conclusive that the country around 
Ngami is drying up. Thedcsiccation appears to be rapid. In 1849 
when David Livingstone visited Ngami the lake though shallow was 
of considerable extent. Later travellers reported progressive 
decrease in the size of the lake and in 1896 Sir F. D. Lugard and Dr 
Siegfried Passarge found it dry. Dr Passarge was told by the natives 
that the cessation of the river's flow was caused, about 1890, by a 
blocking of the channel by thousands of rafts. 

Although the river system below the Magwekwana outlet of the 
Okavango is drying up, above that point there are long stretches of 
navigable water both on the Okavango and the Kwito, in all con- 
siderably over 1000 m. The Popa falls are the last of a series of six 
in a^ distance of 40 m., but none present serious engineering diffi- 
culties. The Magwekwana connexion with the Zambezi is a little 
over 100 m. long, and for more than half its course flows through a 
deep well-defined bed with a minimum width of 100 yards. The fall 
to the Linyanti affluent of the Zambezi is only a few feet and the 
country presents no obstacles to the construction of artificial 
channels. 

Ngami is within the (British) Bechuanaland protectorate, about 
£0 m. E. of the frontier of German South-West Africa. The district 
is the home of the Batawana tribe of Bechuana, with whom is 
stationed a European magistrate. The tribes living along the lower 
Okavango are tributary to the Bechuana ; and the blocking of the 
channel referred to was occasioned by their bringing to Ngami their 
annual tribute of corn.

NGAN-HUI (An-hwei or Gan-hwuy), an eastern province of 
China, whicn, together with Kiang-su and Kiang-si, forms the 
vice-royalty of Kiang-nan. It is bounded N. by Ho-nan, E. 
by Kiang-su and Cheh-kiang, S. by Kiang-si and W. by Hu-peh 
and Ho-nan. It covers an area of 48,461 sq. m., and contains a 
population of 23,600,000. Its principal city is Ngan-k'ing on 
the Yangtsze Kiang, besides which it numbers seven prefectural 
cities. One district city, Ho-fei, is noted as having heen the 
birthplace of Li Hungchang (1822-1001). The southern half of 
the province, that portion south of the Yangtsze Kiang, forms 
part of the Nan-shan, or hilly belt of the south-eastern provinces, 
and produces, besides cotton, coal and iron ore, large quantities 
of green tea. There are also considerable forest areas. Ngan- 
hui is one of the most productive provinces of China. Over the 
whole of its southern portion tea is largely grown, notably in 
the districts of Hui-chow Fu, Tung-liu, Ta-tung and Wu-hu. 
The Yangtsze Kiang is the principal river of the province, and 
is of great importance for foreign commerce, supplying direct 
water communication between some of the principal tea-growing 
districts and the neighbourhood of Hang-chow. The only other 
river of importance is the Hwai-ho (see China: The Country), 
Wu-hu on the Yangtsze Kiang is the only open port in this 
province. From this port a railway runs S.E. to Wen-chow — an 
open seaport in Cheh-kiang province. 


NIAGARA, a river of North America, running northward 
from Lake Erie to Lake Ontario, and carrying the discharge of 
all the Laurentian or Great Lakes, except Lake Ontario (see 
St Lawrence River). It constitutes part of the boundary 
hetween the United States and Canada, separating the state of 
New York from the province of Ontario. It is navigable from 
its head to Chippawa, 16 m., and from Queenston to its mouth, 
6 m. The intervening 9 m. include a series of rapids and the Falls 
of Niagara. On the right bank are Buffalo, Tonawanda, Niagara 
Falls, Lewiston and Youngstown, of New York; on the left 
bank, Chippawa, Niagara Falls, Queenston and Niagara-on-the- 
Lake, of Ontario. 

The Falls of Niagara are justly celebrated for their grandeur 
and beauty, and are viewed every year by from 800,000 to 
1,200,000 visitors. They are in two principal parts, separated 
by an island. The greater division, adjoining the left bank, is 
called the Horseshoe Fall; its height is 155 ft., and the length 
of its curving crest line is about 2600 ft. The American Fall, 
adjoining the right bank, is 162 ft. high and about 1400 ft. broad.

its clearness contributes to the beauty of the cataract. In recog- 
nition of the importance of the waterfall as a great natural 
spectacle, the province of Ontario and the state of New York 
have retained or acquired title to the adjacent lands and con- 
verted them into parks, which are maintained at public expense 
for the convenience and pleasure of visitors. The cataract is 
thus a great aesthetic asset of the people of the world; but its 
perpetuity has been threatened because it is also a great economic 
asset of the bordering nations. The flow of water in the river 
at mean stage is 222,000 cub. ft. per second, at low stage 176,000 
cub. ft. The descent of this stream at the Falls, and in the rapids 
just above them, affords a theoretic water power equal to nearly 
four million horse power, and it is estimated that three-fourths 
of this is practically available. The annual value of the power 
must be reckoned in millions of pounds sterling, at least, and 
possibly in tens of millions. In the utilization of this natural 
power a beginning has been made; about 15,000 cub. ft. of water 
per second are now used for the development of electric power, 
and much larger appropriations have been authorized. As the 
full development of the economic value involves the diversion 
of the river from its channel and the destruction of the cataract 
as a scenic feature, the economic and aesthetic interests are 
antagonistic. An agitation started by the champions of scenic 
beauty led to negotiations looking to the regulation of economic 
exploitation by international agreement. 

The river has no valley. The belt of land it crosses consists 
of two plains separated by a high cliff or escarpment facing, 
towards Lake Ontario. The stream runs half its length on the 
upper plain, drops at the falls into a narrow gorge through which 
it courses 7 m. to the escarpment, and then traverses the lower 
plain in a deep channel. Under the lower plain are soft shales. 
The crest of the escarpment is a bed of limestone, nearly level,, 
and this bed is visible in both walls of the gorge to the falls, 
where it is 60 ft. thick. From this firm brink the cataract plunges 
down into a deep pool or basin hollowed from the soft shale, 
and the resulting agitation causes further wear of the shale and 
the continual undermining of the limestone, which breaks away 
in blocks. Thus the site of the cataract retreats up stream and 
the gorge is lengthened; the average rate, measured from 1842 
to 1905 being about 5 ft. a year. It is evident that the whole 
gorge has been dug out by the river, and many attempts have 
been made to determine the time consumed in the work. 

The problem of the river's age is of much interest to geologists, 
because its solution would aid in establishing a relation between the 
periods and ages of geologic time and the centuries of human chrono- 
logy. The great Canadian glacier, which in the Glacial period 
alternately crowded forward overthe Great Lakes region and melted 
back again, so modified the face of the land by erosion and by the 
deposit of drift that the waters afterwards had to find new courses. 
The Niagara river came into existence when the waning of the glacier 
laid bare the western part of the Ontario basin, and the making of 
the gorge was then begun. If it were supposable that the lengthening 
of the gorge proceeded at a uniform rate, the computation of the time 
would be easy, but there are various modifying conditions. (1) The 
limestone is not equally thick all along the gorge ; in oneplaee it is 
90 ft., and in several places as little as 35 ft. (2) The height of the 
cataract has varied from 155 ft. to more than 300 ft. (3) For a short 
distance at the whirlpool the limestone and shale were replaced by 
softer material, sand and clay. The river here touched a more ancient 
gorge, which had previously been concealed by drift except at the 
escarpment. The diagram shows the breach in the escarpment at 
St Davids directed towards the sharp turn of the river gorge at the 
whirlpool. (4) The size of the river has varied. While the glacier 
was gradually melting the lakes underwent a complicated series 
of metamorphoses, and there were two separate epochs when the 
discharge from all the basins beyond Lake Erie followed other routes, 
and during these epochs the Niagara drained only one-eighth of its 
present territory. The variation in the size of the river is the most 
important of the modifying conditions, and at the same time least 
amenable to computation. 

The parts of the gorge eroded by the full river are now marked by 
deep pools, the powerful cataract having dug far down into the shale. 
The parts eroded by the depleted river are comparatively narrow 
and shallow, the weaker cataract having been unable to clear away 
the fallen blocks of limestone. The work of the full river is illustrated 
by the main division of the present cataract, called the Horseshoe 
Fall, which wore its cliff back 335 ft. in 63 years. The work of the 
depleted river is less adequately . represented by the narrower and 
shallower American Fall; where the present rate of recession is 
about one-twenty-fifth as fast. In making two-thirds of the gorge 
the full river probably consumed between 5000 and 15,000 years. 
If the depleted river worked one- tenth as fast, the period required for 
the remaining third was five times as long; but the relative rate is 
wholly conjectural. A weighing of the evidence now available 
indicates 25,000 years as a lower limit for plausible estimates of the 
age of the river, but yields no suggestion of an upper limit.

NIAGARA, FORT, an American fortification, on the E. side 
and at the mouth of Niagara river, opposite the Canadian village 
of Niagara, or Niagara-on-the-Lake. Fort Niagara has a reser- 
vation of 288 acres, with fairly modern equipments, several 
historic buildings of the time of French and of British possession, 
in one of which, the old magazine (1757), William Morgan was 
imprisoned in 1826. Fort Niagara was long, especially during 
the French occupation of Canada, one of the most important 
forts in North America, being the key to the Great Lakes, beyond 
Lake Ontario. " This immense extent of inland navigation," 
says Parkman, " was safe in the hands of France so long as she 
held Niagara. Niagara lost not only the lakes but also the 
valley of the Ohio was lost with it." Rene Robert Cavelier, 
Sieurde La Salle, wintered here in 1678-9, built his ship the "Grif- 
fon," and established a trading post and Fort Conti, destroyed not 
long afterwards. FortDenonville, built in 1687 by Jacques Rene 
de Bresay, marquis de Denonvillc, governor-general of Canada, 
in his cruel campaign against the Iroquois, was abandoned in 
1688, after the garrison, commanded by Pierre de Troyes 
(d. 1687), had been wiped out by an epidemic. The first Fort 
Niagara, to be so named, was built in 1 725-1 727 at the instance 
■of Charges le Moyne, 1st baron of Longueil (1656-1729), and 
became a very important military and trading post; the fort 
wasrebuilt by Francois Pouchot (1712-1769) in 1756, but in July 
1759, after a siege of about sixteen days, it was surrendered to 
Sir William Johnson by Pouchot, who wrote a Memoir upon the 
Late War (translated and edited by F. B. Hough; 2 vols., 1866). 
On the 14th of September 1763 a British force marching from 
Fort Schlosser (about 2 m. above the Falls; built 1750) to Fort 
Niagara was ambushed by Indians, who threw most of their 
captives into Devil's Hole, along the Niagara river. In July 
1764 a treaty with the Indians was signed here, which detached 
some of them from Pontiac's conspiracy. Joseph Brant, John 
Butler, and, in general, the Indians of north-western New York 
favouring the British during the American War of Independence, 
made Fort Niagara their headquarters, whence they ravaged the 
frontier, and many loyalists and Indians took refuge here at the 
time of General Sullivan's expedition into western New York 
in 1779. The fort was not surrendered to the United States until 
August 1796. In the War of 181 2 it was bombarded by the guns 
of Fort George (immediately across the river in the town now 
called Niagara, then Newark 1 ) on the 13th and 14th of October 
1812; was the starting-point of the American expedition which 
took Fort George on the 27th of May 1813; and on the 19th of 
December 1813 was surprised and taken by assault — most of 
the garrison being killed or taken prisoners — by British troops 
under John Murray (1774-1862), who had previously retaken 
Fort George. After the close of the war, on the 27th of March 
181 5, Fort Niagara was restored to the United States, and a 
garrison was kept there until 1826. The fort was regarrisoned 
about 1836.

NIAGARA FALLS (formerly Clifton or Suspension Bridge), a 
town and port of entry of Welland county, Ontario, Canada, 
40 m. S.S.E. of Toronto, on the west bank of the Niagara river 
and opposite the Falls. Pop. (1901) 4244. It is a station on the 
Grand Trunk, Michigan Central and St Catharines & Niagara 
Central railways, and has electric railway communication with 
the chief towns in the neighbourhood. Three large steel bridges 
connect it with the American town of Niagara Falls on the 
opposite bank. Its importance is chiefly due to the tourist 
traffic, but the unrivalled water power is being more and more 
■employed. Factories have sprung up, and power is transmitted 
to Toronto and other cities. A beautiful park, named after

NIAGARA FALLS, a city of Niagara county, New York, 
U.S.A., on the E. side of the Niagara river, at the Falls, 22 m. 
N.N.W. of Buffalo. Pop. (1900) 19,457, of whom 7326 were 
foreign-born, (1910 census) 30,445. The city is served by 
the New York Central & Hudson River, the Wabash, the Erie, 
the Lehigh Valley, the West Shore and the Michigan Central 
railways, and by the International Electric railway and the 
Niagara, St Catharines & Toronto (electric) railway. The city 
extends along the level summit of the cliffs from above the Falls 
to some 3 m. below. The river is here crossed by three bridges; 
the (upper) steel arch bridge, built (1895) on the site of the former 
suspension bridge (built in 1869; blown down in 1889; rebuilt as 
a suspension bridge) near the Falls, is crossed by double carriage- 
ways and footpaths and by an electric railway, and is pro- 
bably the longest bridge of the kind in the world, being 1240 ft. 
long with an arch span of 840 ft.; and i\ m. farther down the 
river are two railway bridges, the Michigan Central's cantilever 
bridge, completed in 1883, and the (lower) single steel arch bridge 
(completed in 1897, on the site of John A. Roebling's suspension 
bridge built in 1 851-1856) of the Grand Trunk railway, which 
has a terminus at Niagara Falls (Clifton), Ontario, and connects 
here with the New York Central & Hudson River and the Lehigh 
Valley railways. 

The principal buildings of the city are the Niagara Falls 
Memorial Hospital, the Federal Building and the Niagara Falls 
Power Co. Building. The city has a Carnegie library, Dc Veaux 
College (Protestant Episcopal, chartered in 1853), and Niagara 
University, a Roman Catholic institution, founded in 1856 by 
the priests of the Congregation of the Mission and incorporated 
in 1863 as the Seminary of Our Lady of Angels, a name still 
used for the theological department, but displaced, since the 
charter of the university in 1883, by the present name. In the 
extreme S.W. part of the city is Prospect Park, which with Goat 
Island immediately S., and several smaller islands, has been, 
since 1885, the " New York State Reservation at Niagara Falls." 
From the Falls, which gave the city its first importance as a 
stopping place for tourists, valuable electric and hydraulic 
power is derived (by a tunnel 29 ft. deep and 18 ft. wide, passing 
about 200 ft. under the surface of the city, from the tipper steel 
arch bridge to a point i\ m. above the Falls, and by the canal of 
the Niagara FallsHydraulic Power and Manuf acturingCompany). 
Niagara Falls is an important manufacturing city; the value 
of the factory products increased from $8,540,184 in 1900 to 
$16,915,786 in 1905, or 98a %. The city is the shipping centre 
for the W. part of Niagara county. The village of Niagara Falls 
was for a time called Manchester. In 1892 the village of Sus- 
pension Bridge (formerly Niagara City) was joined with it under 
a city charter, which has been frequently amended, 


NIAM-NIAM (Zandekj A-Zandek), a people of Central Africa, 
of mixed Negroid descent. With kindred tribes, they stretch 
from the While Nile above the Sobat confluence to the Shari 
affluent of Lake Chad, and from the Bahr-el-Arab, about io°N., 
nearly to the equator. Their political ascendancy, weakened 
by the incessant attacks of the Arab-Nubian slave-raiders before 
the rise of the Sudanese mahdi in 1882, was afterwards broken 
by the forces of the Congo Free State and the Anglo-Egyptian 
Sudan. 

The term Niam-Niam appears to be of Dinka origin, meaning 
in that language " great eaters," with reference, as is supposed, 
to their cannibalistic propensities. They are called Babungera 
by the Mangbettu (Monbuttu), A-Madyaka by the Diur, Mundo 
or Manyanya by the Bongo, Makaraka or Kakaraka by the 
Mittu. But Niam-Niam has been adopted and*generalized by 
the Sudan and Nubian Mahommedans. Their native name is 
Zandeh (pi. A-Zandeh), which is current throughout the eastern 
Niam-Niam domain, a region estimated by Georg Schweinfurth, 
who visited the country in 1870, at about 48,000 sq. m., with 
a population of at least two millions. But these by no means 
constitute a uniform ethnical group, for within this area is the 
large Madi nation, differing altogether in speech and even 
in some respects physically from the ordinary Niam-Niam type. 
Apart also from numerous tribal divisions, the eastern Niam- 
Niam proper form three very distinct branches. The bleak 
northern highlands bordering east on the Bongo and north on 
Dar-Fertit are occupied by the Banda Niam-Niam. To the 
southwards are the more civilized Belanda Niam-Niam, who 
hold the fertile hilly territory of the Nile-Congo watershed. 
Very different from either are the so-called " White " Niam- 
Niam, neighbours of the Madi of the Makua-Welle river basin. 
Their complexion is of a lighter bronze tint, and they are dis- 
tinguished from the other branches of the family by their tall 
stature, symmetrical figure, long kinky hair and beard and 
higher social culture. They wear cotton garments, obtained by 
barter for ivory, copper and iron, and have a tendency to political 
unity under one chief. 1 

There is, however, a very distinct Niam-Niam type, one of the 
most marked in the whole of Africa. " These beings," remarks 
Schweinfurth, on his first introduction to them, " stood out like 
creatures of another world ... a people of a marked and most 
distinct nationality, and that in Africa and amongst Africans is 
saying much." They are of medium height and powerful build. 
The great space between the eyes, which are almond-shaped and 
slightly slanting, gives them a peculiar expression. They have 
a very short nose, with correspondingly long upper lip; woolly 
hair; a very round head, agreeing in this respect with the Bongo 
of the Bahr-el-Ghazal but differing from the great majority of 
the other African dark races; features generally round, with less 
jaw-projection and altogether more regular than the typical 
Negro; of a ruddy brown or chocolate colour, scarcely ever 
black, but occasionally bronze and even olive. 

The average Niam-Niam is distinguished by some excellent 
qualities, such as frankness, courage, an instinctive love of art, 
and above all a genuine and lasting affection for his women, such 
as is betrayed by no other African race. By tribal custom the 
men are all hunters, armed with long knives and spears and 
carrying oblong shields of wicker-work; the women all tillers 
of the soil, which with little toil yields abundant crops of cereals, 
yams, manioc, colocasia and Virginian tobacco. Both sexes 
wear large pins of ivory, iron, monkey or human bone stuck in 
their hair, and stain their skin with red camwood and the oil 
of a wild berry. The Niam-Niam are intelligent, skilful builders, 
and proficient in many native industries. Prominent among 
these are their earthenware vessels, which display considerable 
symmetry; iron smelting and metal work, such as swords, 
knives and spears; wood carvings, such as stools, benches, 
bowls and tobacco pipes, of varied and intricate design and often 
admirable works of art. They are great smokers, and very fond 
of music. Of the ox, horse, ass or camel they have no knowledge; 
the only domestic animals are "poultry, and a breed of dogs, like 
small wolf-hounds, with smooth red hair, twisted tail like a 
porker's, large ears, pointed nose and four-clawed hind feet. 
These curious little " greyhounds " join in the chase with small 
wooden bells round the neck, and are thus soon found when lost 
in the woods. 

The Niam-Niam are distinguished by their elaborate head- 
dresses (they formerly wore a sort of big full-but tomed wig, and 
Dr W. Junker actually saw elderly people in these), and peculiar 
tattoo markings — square patterns on forehead, temples or cheeks, 

	1 About the middle of the 19th century, most of the eastern Niam- 
	Niam lands appear to have been subject to Yapaty, son of Mabengeh. 
	But after his death they were distributed amongst his seven sons, 
	Renjy, Balia, Perkye, Tombo, Bazimbey, Manuba; and in 1870 
	there were already fourteen reigning princes of this dynasty, besides 
	several of doubtful relationship with the line of Mabengeh. In the 
	Niam-Niam districts visited by the traders from the Egyptian Sudan 
	there were at that time altogether as many as thirty-five independent 
	chiefs. But reports were current of a very powerful " sultan " 
	named Mofio, whose empire lay some 300 rn. farther west. Another 
	large state, founded in the Welle region by Kipa (Kifa), brother of 
	Yapaty, also fell to pieces after his death in 1868. The powerful 
	chiefs Bakangoi and Kanna, visited in 1883 by G. Casati, were sons 
	of this Kipa, whose grave near Kanna's village was still watched by 
	twenty-five " vestals," bound, under penalty of death, to keep a fire 
	constantly burning, and to preserve their chastity inviolate

an X-shaped figure in a cartouche below the chest, and various 
zigzag, straight or dotted lines on the upper arm and breast. 
Most of them file the incisors. From the malted grain of a species 
of eleusine they brew good beer, of a sparkling brown or reddish 
colour and pleasant bitter taste, derived from the stalk of the 
same cereal. 

In this widespread Negroid family are now provisionally grouped 
the Makaraka, intermingled with the Mundu, and the Babukur in 
the north-east (Bahr-el-Ghazal) ; the Krej, Banda and N'Sakkara in 
the north-west (Dar-Fertit, and thence to the upper Shari); the 
Banziriy Ndris, Togbo, Languassi, Dakoa, Ngapu, Wia-Wia, Manja, 
Awaka, Akunga and others about both slopes of the Congo-Chad 
water-parting. These last, who give such an enormous westward 
extension to the family, present much the same physical characters 
as the Zandeh proper, and speak dialects of the widely diffused Ndris 
language, which is not Bantu, but appears to show affinities with 
Zandeh. 

This great division ethnologists are even disposed to connect with 
the Fula of west and central Sudan, and to substitute for the now 
exploded " Nuba-Fula " a " Zandeh-Fula " family, resulting from 
various secular interminglings between the true negroes and the 
Berbers of North Africa. Such crossings have undoubtedly been in 
progress since prehistoric times over an enormous area south of the 
Sahara (Africa: Ethnology), and are almost everywhere marked by 
certain constant characters, such as long ringlety or kinky black hair, 
coppery, reddish or bronze shades of complexion, brachycephalic 
(round) head, often highly pronounced, and indicated outwardly by 
an unusually wide space between the orbits, and generally by some- 
what softened negro features. But, owing to the different environ- 
ments and to the different initial ratios of intermixture, the transi- 
tional forms are almost endless, so that it becomes difficult to consti- 
tute distinct ethnical groups without calling in the aid of language. 
Where type and speech correspond, as to a large extent is the case 
with most of the above-mentioned tribes, even strict systematists 
will be disposed to constitute separate ethnical groups, at least as 
working hypotheses, always allowing for the somewhat untrust- 
worthy nature of the linguistic factor. In the case under con- 
sideration Fula has no kind of connexion with Zandeh speech, but 
this by no means precludes the possibility of racial connexion. 

Beyond a few meagre vocabularies no materials have yet been 
collected for the study of the Zandeh language, which, except in the 
Madi country, appears to be everywhere spoken with considerable 
uniformity in the eastern Niam-Niam lands. Its phonetic system, 
such as initial mb and vowel auslaut, affiliates it, not tothe Libyan, as 
has been asserted, but to the Negro linguistic type. Within this order 
of speech its pronominal prefix inflection points to affinity rather with 
the southern Bantu than^with the Sudan group of languages. Thus 
the personal plural a-, as in A-Zandeh, A-Madi, A-Banga, &c, would 
appear to be identical in origin and meaning with the Bantu wa-, as 
in Wa-Ganda, Wa-Swaheli, Wa-Sambara, &c. Thereis also the same 
dearth of abstract terms, which renders the translation of Scripture 
into the Negro tongues such a difficult task. Compare gumbah, an 
expression for the Deity, really meaning " lightning,' with the 
Chinyanja chuuta = thunder = God (?) and the Zulu Unkulunkulu = 
great-grandfather, also adopted by the missionaries as the nearest 
equivalent for the Deity in that language. 

Politically the dismembered Zandeh empire and dependent 
principalities are divided up between France, which claims the 
" sultanates " of Rafai, Dinda, Zemio and Tambura in the Mbomu 
valley, with all the peoples in Fertit and the Shari basin; Belgium, 
which administers the eastern section between the Mbomu and the 
upper Welle; and Great Britain, to whose share have fallen the 
Makaraka and other Niam-Niam groups of the Bahr-el-Ghazal region.

NIAS, the largest island in the chain off the west coast of 
Sumatra, Dutch East Indies, lying about i° N., 97 30' E. It 
is roughly -oblong in form, measuring about 80 m. by 28, and 
appears to be partly of volcanic origin and to consist partly of 
older rocks corresponding with those of Sumatra. Its extreme 
elevation is about 2300 ft. A number of islets (Nako, Bunga, &c.) 
lie off the west and north coasts. The island is thickly populated 
by a pagan people, who by some authorities, including F. Jung- 
huhn, have been associated with the Battas, but are probably 
a distinct branch of the pre-Malayan or Indonesian race. Slavery 
and head-hunting are universal, despite the efforts of Dutch 
and German missionary societies. The natives are skilled in 
such crafts as weaving and metal-work, as well as in agriculture 
and road-making. Coco-nut oil. is produced on Nias and also 
more especially on the Nako group. A Dutch commissioner is 
established at Gunong Sitoli on the east coast, a settlement of 
Malay and Chinese traders. 


NIBELUNGENLIED, or Der Nibelunge N6t, an heroic epic 
written in a Middle High German dialect. The story on which 
the poem is based belongs to the general stock of Teutonic saga 
and was very widespread under various forms, some of which are 
preserved. Thus it is touched upon in Beowulf, and fragments 
of it form the most important part of the northern Eddas, the 
poets of which evidently assumed that the tale as a whole was 
well known and that their hearers would be able to put each 
piece in its proper place. In the prose Edda, or Volsungasaga, 
which, though largely primitive in spirit, dates from the 13th 
century, it is set forth in full. The substance of this Norse 
version is as follows: — 

The three Anses — Odin, Loki and Hornir — saw an otter devouring 
a salmon beside a waterfall. They killed and skinned the otter and, 
taking the skin with them, sought shelter for the night with Rodmar 
the giant. But Rodmar recognized the skin as that of his son, and 
demanded as weregild gold enough to cover it completely. Loki 
thereupon went back to the stream, where Andvari in the form of a 
pike was guarding a great treasure, caught him in a net, and forced 
him to surrender his hoard. But the piled-up gold left one hair 
exposed; in order to cover it Loki returned to Andvari and forced 
him to surrender a magic ring which had the virtue of breeding gold. 
Thereupon Andvari, enraged, laid upon the hoard and all who 
should possess it a curse. This curse, the Leitmotif of the whole story, 
began to operate at once. Rodmar, for the sake of the treasure, was 
slain by his sons Fafnir and Regin; and Fafnir, seizing the whole, 
retired to a desolate heath and, in the form of a snake or dragon, 
brooded over the hoard. Regin, cheated of his share, plotted 
vengeance and the conquest of the treasure. 

To Regin, a notable smith, was sent Sigurd — son of the slain hero 
Sigmundr the Volsung and his wife Hiortis, now wife of the Danish 
king Alf — to be trained in his craft. To him Regin told of Fafnir 
and the hoard, and the young hero offered to go out against the 
dragon il Regin would weld him a sword. But every brand forged by 
the smith broke under Sigurd's stroke; till at last he fetched the 
fragments of the sword Gram, Odin's gift to his father, which Hiortis 
had carefully treasured. These Sigurd forged into a new sword, so 
hard that with it he couldcleave the anvil and so sharp that it would 
sever a flock of wool floating against it down stream ; and, so armed, 
he sought and slew the dragon. But while roasting Fafnir* s heart, 
which Regin had cut out, Sigurd burned his finger with the boiling 
fat and, placing it to his lips, found that he could understand the 
language of birds, and so learned from the chattering of the wood- 
peckers that Regin was planning treachery. Thereupon he slew the 
smith and loading the treasure on the magic steed Grani, given to him 
by Odin, set out upon his travels. 

On the summit of a fire-girt hill Sigurd found the Valkyrie Brunhild 
in an enchanted sleep, and ravished by her beauty awakened her; 
they plighted their troth to each other and, next morning, Sigurd left 
her to set out once more on his journey. Coming to the court of 
Giuki, a king in the Rhine country, Sigurd formed a friendship with 
his three sons, Gunnar, Hogni and Guthorm; and, in order to retain 
so valuable an ally, it was determined to arrange a match between 
him and their sister Gudrun. Queen Grimhild, skilled in magic, 
therefore gave him an enchanted drink, which caused him to forget 
Brunhild. Gunnar, on the other hand, wished to make Brunhild his 
wife, and asked Sigurd to ride with him on this quest, which he con- 
sented to do on condition of receiving Gudrun to wife. They set out ; 
but Gunnar was unable to pass the circle of fire round Brunhild's 
abode, the achievement that was the condition of winning her hand. 
So Sigurd, assuming Gunnar's shape, rode through the flames on his 
ma^ic horse, and in sign of troth exchanged rings with the Valkyrie, 
giving her the ring of Andvari. So Gunnar and Brunhild were 
wedded, and Sigurd, resuming his own form, rode back with them to 
Giuki's court where the double marriage was celebrated. But 
Brunhild was moody and suspicious, remembering her troth with 
Sigurd and believing that he alone could have accomplished the quest. 

One day the two queens, while bathing in the river, fell to quarrel- 
ling as to which of their husbands was the greater. Brunhild taunted 
Gudrun with the fact that Sigurd was Gunnar's vassal, whereupon 
Gudrun retorted by telling her that it was not Gunnar but Sigurd 
who rode through the flames, and in proof of this held up Brunhild's 
ring, which Sigurd had given to her. Then Brunhild " waxed as wan 
as a dead woman, and spoke no word the day long." Maddened by 
jealousy and wounded pride, she now incited the three kings to 
murder Sigurd by exciting their jealousy of his power. The two 
elder, as bound to him by blood-brotherhood, refused; but the 
youngest, Guthorm, who had sworn no oaths, consented to do the 
deed. Twice he crept into Sigurd's chamber, but fled when he found 
the hero awake and gazing at him with flashing eyes. The third 
time ; finding him asleep, he stabbed him; but Sigurd, before he died, 
had just strength enough to hurl his sword at the murderer, whom it 
cut in two. Brunhild, when she heard Gudrun wailing, laughed aloud. 
But her love for Sigurd was great as ever, and she determined not to 
survive him; distributing her wealth to her hand-maidens, she 
mounted Sigurd's funeral pyre, slew herself with his sword, and was 
burnt with him. 

In course of time Gudrun married Atli (Attila), king of the Huns, 
Brunhild's brother. Atli (> intent on getting hold of the hoard, which 
Gudrun's brothers had seized, invited them to come to his court. In 
spite of their sister's warnings they came, after sinking the treasure 
in the Rhine. On their refusal to surrender the hoard, or to say 
where it was concealed, a fierce fight broke out, in which all the 
followers of Gunnar and Hogni fell. Atli then once more offered to 
spare Gunnar's life if he would reveal his secret; but Gunnar refused 
to do so till he should see the heart of Hogni. The heart of a slave 
was laid before him, but he declared that that could not be Hogni's, 
since it quaked. Hogni's heart wasthen cut out, the victim laughing 
the while; but when Gunnar saw it he cried out that now he alone 
knew where the hoard was and that he would never reveal the secret. 
His hands were then bound, and he was cast into a den of venomous 
serpents; but he played so sweetly on the harp with his toes that he 
charmed the reptiles, except one adder, by which he was stung to 
death. Gudrun, however, avenged the death of her brothers by 
slaying the sons she had borne to Atli and causing him unwittingly 
to drink their blood and eat their hearts. Finally, in the night, 
she killed Atli himself and burned his hall; then, leaping into the 
sea, she was carried by the waves to new scenes, where she had 
adventures not connected with those recorded in the Nibclungenlied. 

This story, in spite of the late date of the Volsungasaga and 
of added elements due to the imagination of its author, evidently 
represents a very primitive version. In the Nibelungen story, 
on the other hand, though its extant versions are of much earlier 
date, and though it contains elements equally primitive not found 
in the other, the spirit and the motives of the earlier story have 
to a large extent been transmuted by later influences, the setting 
of the story being — though by no means consistently — medieval 
rather than primitive. Thus the mysterious hoard is all but lost 
sight of; no mention is made of the curse attached to it; and 
it is only as an afterthought that Siegfried (Slfrit) is described 
as its master. Everywhere the supernatural elements are elimin- 
ated or subordinated, and the story becomes a drama of human 
motives, depending for its development on the interplay of 
human passions and activities. 

	To us in ancient story wonders great are told 
	Of heroes rich in glory and of adventures bold, 
	Of feast and joyous living, of wailing and of woe, 
	Of gallant warriors striving may ye now many marvels know. 1 

That is all he gives by way of preface. The gods have vanished 
from the scene; there is nothing of Loki and his theft of Andvari's 
hoard, nothing of Odin and his gifts of the sword Gram and 
the magic horse Grani; and not till the third Aventhtre, when 
Siegfried comes to Worms, are we given even a hint that such 
things as the sword and treasure exist. On the other hand, in 
the very next stanza we are introduced to what is to be the 
leading motive of the plot: Kriemhild, the Burgundian princess, 
on whose account " many a noble knight was doomed to perish." 
For, as in the legend of Sigurd the Volsung, the plot had turned 
upon the love and vengeance of Brunhild, so in the song of the 
Nibelungs it is the love and vengeance of Kriemhild, the Gudrun 
of the northern saga, that forms the backbone of the story and 
gives it from first to last an artistic unity which the Volsungasaga 
lacks. Of the story itself it is impossible here to give anything 
but the barest outline, sufficient to show its contrast with the 
northern version. We may note at the outset the spirit of 
pessimism which, like the curse on the hoard, pervades the 
whole. It appears in the very first Aventiure, when Kriemhild, 
in answer to her mother's interpretation of her dream, declares 
that she will never marry, since " it has been proved by the 
experience of many women that joy is in the end rewarded by 
sorrow "; it is repeated in the last stanza but one of the long 
poem: "As ever joy in sorrow ends and must end alway." 
This tragic contrast is emphasized by the pomp and circumstance 
that surround the ill-fated hero of the story at the beginning. 

	1 Uns ist in alten maeren wunders vil geseit 
	Von heledcn lobebaeren ^ von gr6zcr arebcit 
	Von freude unt hochgeziten von weinen unde klagen 
	Von kiiener recken striten muget ir nun wunder hoeren sagen. 

The primitive setting of the northern version has vanished utterly. 
Sigmund is king of the Netherlands; the boy Siegfried is brought 
up by " wise men that are his tutors " (Avent. ii.) ; and when, 
attracted by the fame of Kriemhild's beauty, he rides to Worms 
to woo her, it is as the typical handsome, accomplished and 
chivalrous king's son of medieval romance. 

It is at this point (Avent. iv.) that some of the primitive 
elements of the story are suddenly and awkwardly introduced. 
As Siegfried approaches Worms, Kriemhild's brothers, the 
Burgundian kings Gunther, Giselher and Gemot watch his 
coming, and to them their faithful retainer, " the grim Hagen/' 
explains who he is. This, he exclaims, can be no other than the 
hero who slew the two kings of the Nibelungs, Schilbunc and 
Nibelunc, and seized their treasure, together with the sword 
Balmunc and the tarnkappe, or cape of darkness, which has the 
virtue of making him who wears it invisible. Another adventure, 
too, he can tell of him, namely, how he slew a dragon and how by 
bathing in its blood his skin became horny, so that no weapon 
could wound him, save in one place, where a linden leaf had 
fallen upon him as he stooped, so that the blood did not touch 
this spot. 1 In spite of Hagen's distrust and misgivings, Siegfried 
now fights as the ally of the Burgundians against the Saxons 
(Avent. iv.), and undertakes, on condition of receiving Kriemhild 
to wife, to help Gunther to woo Queen Brunhild, who can only 
be won by the man who can overcome her in three trials of 
strength (Avent vi.). Siegfried and Gunther accordingly go 
together to Brunhild's castle of Isenstein in Iceland, and there the 
hero, invisible in his tarnkappe, stands beside Gunther, hurling 
the spear and putting the weight for him, and even leaping, 
with Gunther in his arms, far beyond the utmost limit that 
Brunhild can reach (Avent. vii.). Brunhild confesses herself 
beaten and returns with the others to Worms, where the double 
marriage is celebrated with great pomp (Avent. x.). But Brunhild 
is ill content; though she saw Siegfried do homage to Gunther 
at Isenstein she is not convinced, and believes that Siegfried 
should have been her husband; and on the bridal night she 
vents her ill humour on the hapless Gunther by tying him up 
in a knot and hanging him on the wall. " I have brought the 
evil devil to my house! " he complains to Siegfried next morning; 
and once more the hero has to intervene; invisible in his tarn- 
kappe he wrestles with Brunhild, and, after a desperate struggle, 
takes from her her girdle and ring before yielding place to 
Gunther. The girdle and ring he gives to his wife Kriemhild 
(AvenL x.)* 

One day, while Siegfried and his wife were on a visit to the 
Burgundian court, the two queens fell to quarrelling on the 
question of precedence, not in a river but on the steps of the 
cathedral (Avent. xiv.). Kriemhild was taunted with being the 
wife of Gunther's vassal; whereupon, in wrath, she showed 
Brunhild the ring and the golden girdle taken by Siegfried, proof 
that Siegfried, not Gunther, had won Brunhild. So far the story 
is essentially the same as that in the Volsungasaga; but now the 
plot changes. Brunhild drops out, becoming a figure altogether 
subordinate and shadowy. The death of Siegfried is compassed, 
not by her, but by the " grim " Hagen, Gunther's faithful 
henchman, who thinks the glory of his master unduly over- 
shadowed by that of his vassal. Hagen easily persuades the 
weak Gunther that the supposed insult to his honour can only 
be wiped out in Siegfried's blood; he worms the secret of the 
hero's vulnerable spot out of Kriemhild, on pretence of shielding 
him from harm (AvenL xv.), and then arranges a great hunt in 
the forest, so that he may slay him when off his guard. 

The r6th Aventiure, describing this hunt and the murder of 
Siegfried, is perhaps the most powerful scene in all medieval 
epic. To heighten the effect of the tragic climax the poet 
begins with a description of the hunting, and describes the 
high spirits of Siegfried, who captures a wild boar, rides back 
with it to camp, and there lets it loose to the great discomfiture 
of the cooks. 

When the hunters sat down to feast, it was found that the wine 
had been forgotten. Hagen thereupon proposed that they should 

	1 Compare the heel of Achilles. 

race to a spring of which he knew some way off in the forest. 
Siegfried readily agreed, and though handicapped by carrying 
shield, sword and spear, easily reached the goal first, but waited, 
with his customary courtesy, until the king had arrived and 
drunk before slaking his own thirst. Then, laying aside his 
arms, he stooped and drank. Hagen, seizing the spear, thrust 
it through the spot marked by Kriemhild on Siegfried's surcoat. 
The hero sprang up and, finding that his sword had been removed, 
attacked Hagen with his shield. 
Though to death he was wounded he struck so strong a stroke 
That from the shattered shield-rim forthwith out there broke 
Showers of flashing jewels; the shield in fragments lay. 1 
Then reproaching them for their cowardice and treachery, 
Siegfried fell dying " amid the flowers," while the knights 
gathered round lamenting. At this point two stanzas may be 
quoted as well illustrating the poet's power of dramatic 
characterization : — 
The king of the Burgundians he too bewailed his death: 
Then spake the dying hero : " Nay, now you waste your breath! 
You weep for an ill fortune that you yourself have wrought : 
That is a shameful sorrow : it were better you said nought ! " 
Then out spake the grim Hagen: " I know not why ye plain: 
This is for us the ending of sorrow and of pain. 
Full few are left of foemen that dare withstand us now. 
Glad am I that the hero was by this hand of mine laid low ! " 

This account of the death of Siegfried, which embodies the 
ancient German tradition, is far finer than the northern version, 
according to which Hogni murders the hero in his bed. The 
whole spirit of this Aventiure, too, is primitive Teutonic rather 
than medieval. The same is true, indeed, of the whole of the 
rest of the poem. Siegfried, to be sure, is buried with all the 
pomp of medieval Catholic rites; but Kriemhild, while praying 
for his soul like a good Christian, plots horrible vengeance like 
her pagan prototype. With this significant difference, however: 
Gudrun revenged upon her husband the death of her brothers; 
Kriemhild seeks to revenge upon her brothers the death of her 
husband, The Catholic bond of marriage has become stronger 
than the primitive Teutonic bond of kinship. Mistress now of 
the inexhaustible hoard of the Nibelungs, Kriemhild sought 
to win a following by lavish largesses; but this Hagen frustrated 
by seizing the treasure, with the consent of the kings, and sinking 
it in the Rhine, all taking an oath never to reveal its hiding- 
place, without the consent of the others, so long as they should 
live (Avent. xix.). At last,* however, after thirteen years, 
Kriemhild's chance came, with a proposal of marriage from 
Etzel (Attila) king of the Huns, whom she consented to marry 
on condition that he would help her to vengeance (Avent. xx.). 
Then more years passed; old feuds seemed to be forgotten; 
and the Burgundian kings, in spite of Hagen's warnings, thought 
it safe to accept their sister's invitation to visit her court (Avent. 
xxiii. xxiv.). 

The journey of the Burgundians into Hunland is described 
by the poet at great length (Avent. xxv.-xxvii.). 'The story is 
full of picturesque detail and stirring incident, full also of interest- 
ing problems in folk-lore and mythology; and throughout it 
is dominated by the figure of the grim Hagen, who, twitted with 
cowardice and his advice spurned, is determined that there shall 
be no turning back and that they shall go through with it to the 
bitter end. With his own hands he ferries the host over the 
Danube and then, when the last detachment has crossed, destroys 
the boat, so that there may be no return. At Attila's court 
(Avent. xxviii.) it is again Hagen who provokes the catastrophe 
by taunting Kriemhild when she asks him if he has brought 
with him the hoard of the Nibelungs: 

	11 The devil's what I bring you t " Hagen then replied, 
	" What with this heavy harness and my shield beside, 
	1 had enough to carry: this helmet bright I brought; 
	My sword is in my right hand, and that, be sure, I bring you not!*' 

The sword was Siegfried's. It is Hagen, too, who after the 

	2 This last fight with the shield seems to have belonged to the 
	common stock of heroic story. Cf. the account of the death of 
	Hereward " the Wake " given by Geoffrey Gaimar in the Chronicon 
	Anglo-Norm, and adopted by Freeman in his Norman Conquest 
	(1871), iv. 486. 

first onslaught of the Huns strikes off the head of Ortlieb, the 
son of Etzel and Kriemhild, and who, amid the smoke and 
carnage of the burning hall, bids the Burgundians drink blood if 
they are thirsty. 

Besides Hagen, during the ride into Hunland and in the 
final fight, another figure comes to the front, that of Volker 
the Fiddler, so far only mentioned as a hero of the Saxon war 
in Avent. ii. He rides fiddling at the head of the host; he plays 
to the weary warriors in the intervals of the battle in the court 
of Etzel's palace; but he is also expert at performing other 
music, with " a strong fiddle-bow, mighty and long, like to a 
sword, exceeding sharp and broad." He is the type* of the 
medieval knightly minstrel of the age of the Minnesang. 

But for all their prowess, after a prolonged struggle (Avent. 
xxix.-xxxvii.), the Burgundians were at last overwhelmed. 
Most of the chief figures of heroic saga had come up against 
them: Attila, Hildebrand, the Ostrogoth Theodoric (Dietrich 
von Bern). To the last-named even Hagen armed with Sieg- 
fried's sword had to yield (Avent. xxxviii.). Kriemhild came to 
him as he lay in bonds and demanded the Nibelung treasure. He 
refused to reveal its hiding-place so long as Gunther, also a 
prisoner, should live. Gunther was accordingly slain by the 
queen's orders and his head was brought to Hagen, who cried out 
when he saw it that all had been accomplished as he had foretold: 

	" Now none knows where the hoard is save God and I alone: 
	That to thee, devil-woman, shall nevermore be known ! " 

Whereupon Kriemhild slew him with Siegfried's sword. But 
Kriemhild was not destined, like Gudrun, to set out on further 
adventures. Hildebrand, horrified at her deed, sprang forward 
and cut her to pieces with his sword. 

	In sorrow now was ended the king's high holiday, 
	As ever joy in sorrow ends and must end alway. 

To some MSS. of the Nibelungenlied is added a supplementary 
poem called the Klage or Lament, a sequel of 2160 short-line 
couplets, describing the lament of the survivors — notably Etzel — 
over the slain, the burying of the dead, and the carrying of the 
news to the countries of the Burgundians and others. At the end 
it is stated that the story was written down, at the com- 
mand of Bishop Pilgrim of Passau, by a writer named Konrad 
(Kuonrat) in Latin, and that it had since been sung (getichtet) 
often in the German tongue. 

Sources of the Story. — The origin and nature of the various 
elements that go to make up the story of the Nibelungen- 
lied have been, and continue to be, .the subject of very lively 
debate. The view at one time most generally accepted was 
that first propounded by Karl Lachmann in his." Kritik der 
Sage von den Nibelungen " (Rheinisches Museum fur Philologie } 
Num. 249, -250, 1829, republished in his Zu den Nibelungen . . . 
Anmerkungen in 1836), namely, that the story was originally a 
myth of the northern gods, modified into a heroic saga after 
the introduction of Christianity, and intermingled with historical 
elements. This view is maintained by Richard von Muth in 
his Einleitung in das Nibelungenlied (Paderborn, 1877), who 
thus sums up the result of his critical researches: " The basis 
of all is an old myth of a beneficent divine being (Siegfried), 
who conquers daemonic powers (the Nibelungen), but is slain 
by them (the Burgundians turned Nibelungen); with this 
myth was connected the destruction of the Burgundian kingdom, 
ascribed to Attila, between 437 and 453, and later the legend 
of Attila's murder by his wife; in this form, after Attila and 
Theodoric had been associated in it, the legend penetrated, 
between 555 and 583, to the North, where its second part was 
developed in detail on the analogy of older sagas, while in Germany 
a complete change of the old motif took place." To this theory 
the objection is raised that it is but a theory; that it is un- 
supported by any convincing evidence; and that the process 
which it postulates, that, namely, of the transformation of the 
gods into heroes by the popular imagination, is contrary to all 
that we know of the -fate of dethroned deities, who are apt to 
live on in fairy stories in very unheroic guise. So early as 1783 
Johannes von Miiller of Gottingen had called attention to the 
historical figures appearing in the Nibelungenlied , identifying 
Etzel as Attila, Dietrich of Bern as Theodoric of Verona, and the 
Burgundian kings Gunther, Giselher and Gemot as the Gun- 
daharius, Gislabarius and Godomar of the Lex Burgundioruvt; 
in 1820 Julius Leichtlen (Neuaufgefnndenes Bruchstilck dcs 
Nibelungenliedes, Freiburg-im-Breisgau) roundly declared that 
" the Nibelungenlied rests entirely on a historical foundation, 
and that any other attempt to explain it must fail." This view 
was, however, overborne by the great authority of Lachmann, 
whose theory, in complete harmony with the principles popular- 
ized by the brothers Grimm, was accepted and elaborated by 
a long series of critics. It is only 6f late years that criticism 
has tended to revert to the standpoint of Miiller and Leichtlen 
and to recognize in the story of the Nibelungen as a whole a 
misty and confused tradition of real events and people. Mythical 
elements it certainly contains; and to those figures which — 
like Siegfried, Brunhild, Hagen and the " good margrave " 
Ruedeger of Bechlaren — cannot be traced definitively to historical 
originals, a mythical origin is still provisionally ascribed. But 
criticism is still busy attempting to trace these also to historical 
originals, and Theodor Abeling (Das Nibelungenlied , 1907) 
makes out a very plausible case for identifying Siegfried with 
Segeric, son of the Burgundian king Sigimund, Brunhild with 
the historical Brunichildis, and Hagen with a certain Hagnericus, 
who, according to the Life of St Columban, guided the saint 
(the chaplain of the Nibelungenlied), who had incurred the 
enmity of Brunichildis, safe to the court of her grandson Theu- 
derich, king of the West Franks. 

Herr Abeling's theory of the sources of the Nibelungen story 
is one among many; but, as it is one of the latest and not the 
least ingenious, it deserves mention. That the Icelandic Eddas 
contain the oldest versions of the legend, though divided and 
incomplete, is universally admitted. It is equally well established, 
however, that Iceland could not have been its original home. 
This Herr Abeling locates among the Franks of what is now 
southern France, whence the stories spread, from the 6th century 
onwards, on the one hand across the Rhine into Franconia, 
on the other hand westwards and northwards, by way of Ireland — 
at that* time in close intercourse with continental Europe — and 
the northern islands, to Iceland. Hence the two traditions, 
the German and the Icelandic, of which the latter alone is 
preserved in something of its primitive form, 1 though primitive 
elements survive in the Nibelungenlied. 

The basis of the story is then, according to this view, historical,, 
not mythical: a medley of Franco-Burgundian historical 
traditions, overlaid with mythical fancies. 2 The historical 
nucleus is the overthrow of the Burgundian kingdom of Gun- 
dahar by the Huns in 436; and round this there gathered 
an accretion of other episodes, equally historical in their origin, 
however distorted, with a naive disregard of chronological 
possibility: the murder of Segeric (c. 525), the murder of 
Sigimund by the sons of Chrothildis, wife of Clovis (identified 
by Abeling with Kriemhild), the murder of Attila by his Bur- 
gundian wife Ildico (see Kriemhild). In the Eddas the identity 
of the original Franco-Burgundian sagas is fairly preserved. 
In the Nibelungenlied , on the other hand, the influence of other 
wholly unconnected stories is felt: thus Hildebrand appears- . 
during the final fight at Etzel's court, and Theodoric the Great 
(Dietrich von Bern; see Theodoric), for no better reason than 
that the Dietrich legend had sent him into exile there, and that 
he must have been there when the Burgundians arrived. 

Origin of the Poem. — The controversy as to the underlying 
elements of the Nibelung legend extends to the question of the 
authorship and construction of the poem itself. Was it from 
the first — whatever additions and interpolations may have 

	1 The'Eddas were first written down, as is commonly assumed, by 
	Bishop Saemund Sigfusson (1056-1133). 

	2 The process of this overlaying is easy to realize if we remember 
	how usual it was to transfer characteristics and episodes drawn from 
	immemorial folk-lore to successive historical personages. A good 
	example is the " Swan-maiden " myth connected with the house of 
	Bouillon (see Lohengrin). See also other interesting cases cited 
	in the chapter on the " Geste of John de Courci " in Mr J. H, 
	Round's Peerage and Pedigree (London, 1910). 

followed — conceived as a single, coherent story, or is it based 
on a number of separate stories, popular ballads akin to the 
Eddas, which the original author of the Nibelungenlied merely 
collected and strung together? The answer to these questions 
has been sought by a succession of scholars in a critical com- 
parison of the medieval MSS. of the poem still surviving. Of 
these S3 are now known, of which 10 are complete, the rest being 
more or less fragmentary. The most important are those 
first discovered, viz. the MSS. lettered C (Hohenems, i755)> 
B (Schloss Werdenberg, 1769), A (Hohenems, 1779); and 
round these the others more or less group themselves. They 
exhibit many differences: put briefly, C is the most perfectly 
finished in language and rhythm; A is rough, in places barbarous; 
B stands half-way between the two. Which is nearest to the 
original? Karl Lachmann (Zu den Nibelungen und zar Klage, 
Anmerkungen, 1836) decided in favour of A. He applied to the 
Nibelungenlied the method which Friedrich August Wolf had 
used to resolve the Iliad and Odyssey into their elements. The 
poem, according to Lachmann, was based on some twenty 
popular ballads, originally handed down orally, but written 
down about 1190 or 1200. This original is lost, and A — as its 
roughness of form shows — is nearest to it; all other MSS., 
including B and C, are expansions of A. The great authority 
of Lachmann made this opinion the prevalent one, and it still 
has its champions. It was first seriously assailed by Adolf 
Holtzmann (Unlersuchungen iiber das Nib., Stuttgart, 1854), 
who argued that the original could not have been strophic in 
form — the fourth lines of the strophes are certainly often of the 
nature of " padding" — that it was written by Konrad (Kuonrat 
of the Klage), writer to Bishop Pilgrim of Passau about 970-984, 
and that of existing MSS. C is nearest to this original, B the 
copy of a MS. closely akin to C, and A an abbreviated, corrupt 
copy of B. This view was adopted by Friedrich Zarncke, who 
made C the basis of his edition of the Nibelungenlied (Leipzig, 
1856). A new hypothesis was developed by Karl Bartsch in 
his Unlersuchungen iiber das Nibelungenlied (Leipzig, 1865). 
According to this the original was an assonance poem of the 12th 
century, which was changed between n 90 and 1200 by two 
separate poets into two versions, in which pure rhymes were 
substituted for the earlier assonances: the originals of the 
Nibelungenlied and Der Nibelunge N3t respectively. Bartsch's 
subsequent edition of tfce Nibelunge N3t (1st ed., Leipzig, 1870) 
was founded on B, as the nearest to the original. To this view 
Zarncke was so far converted that in the 1887 edition of his 
Nibelungenlied he admitted that C shows signs of recension and 
that the B group is purer in certain details. 

As a result of all this critical study Herr Abeling comes to the 
following conclusions. The poem was first written down by a 
wandering minstrel about 971 to 991, was remodelled about 
1 140 by Konrad, 1 who introduced interpolations in the spirit 
of chivalry and was perhaps responsible for the metre; during 
the wars and miseries of the next fifty years manners and taste 
became barbarized and the fine traditions of the old popular 
poetry were obscured, and it was under this influence that, 
about 1 190, a jongleur (Spielmann) revised the poem, this re- 
cension being represented by group B. After 1190, during the 
Golden Age of the art poetry (Kunstdichtung) of the Minnesingers 
(q.v.), a professional poet (Rudolf von Ems?) again remodelled 
the poem, introducing further interpolations, and changing the 
title from Der Nibelunge N6t into Das Nibelungenliet, this 
version being the basis of the group C. The MS. A, as proved 
by its partial excellence, is based directly on Konrad's work, 
with additions borrowed from B. I. Bartsch and others ascribe its
authorship, with much plausibility, to an Austrian knight of the
race of Kurenberg, the earliest of the courtly lyric poets, 
whose lyrics are written in the Nibelung strophe. Thus compare
Kurenberg's lyric (Lachmann and Haupt, Des Minnesangs Fruhling,
4th ed. f F. Vogt, Leipzig, 1888)— 

	" Ich zoch mir einen valken mere danne ein jar " 
	with the Nibelungen Not (Bartsch) Av. i. 13— 
	" troumte Kriemhilde. 
	Wie sie ziige einen valken, stare scoen' und wilde."

NICAEA, or Nice [mod. Isnik, i.e. eh Nucaiav] an ancient 
town of Asia Minor, in Bithynia, on the Lake Ascania. Antigonus 
built the city (316 B.C. ?) on an old deserted site, and soon after- 
wards Lysimachus changed its name from Antigonia to Nicaea, 
calling it after his wife. Under the Roman empire Nicaea and 
Nicomedia disputed the title of metropolis of Bithynia. Strabo 
describes the ancient Nicaea as built regularly, in the form of 
a square, with a gate in the middle of each side. From a monu- 
ment in the centre of the city all the four gates were visible 
at the extremities of great cross-streets. After Constantinople 
became the capital of the empire Nicaea grew in importance, 
and after the conquest of Constantinople by the Crusaders 
became the temporary seat of the Byzantine emperor; the double 
line of walls with the Roman gates is still well preserved. The 
possession of the city was long disputed between the Greeks 
and the Turks. It remained an important city for some time 
after its final incorporation in the Ottoman empire; but became 
subsequently an insignificant village. 


NICAEA, COUNCIL OF, The Council of Nicaea (a.d. 325) is 
an event of the highest importance in the history of Christianity. 
Its convocation and its course illustrate the radical revolution 
which the position of this religion, within the confines of the 
Roman empire, had undergone in consequence of the Edict of 
Milan. Further, it was the first oecumenical council, and this 
fact invested it with a peculiar halo in the eyes of subsequent 
ages; while among its resolutions may be found a series of 
decisions which acquired a lasting significance for the Christian 
Church. This applies more especially to the reception of the 
doctrine of the Trinity; for though, immediately after the close 
of the synod, it was exposed to a powerful opposition, it gained 
the day, and, in the form which it received at Nicaea and at 
the council of Constantinople (381), still enjoys official validity 
in the principal churches of Christendom. Finally, the council 
marks an epoch in the history of the conception of the Christian 
religion, in that it was the first attempt to ^x the criteria of 
Christian orthodoxy by means of definitely formulated pro- 
nouncements on the content of Christian belief — the acceptance 
of these criteria being made a sine qua non of membership of the 
Church. Moreover, it admitted the principle that the state 
might employ the secular arm to bring the Christian subjects 
of the Roman world-empire under the newly codified faith. 
Thus the Nicene Council is an important stage in the develop- 
ment of the state-church, though the completion of that edifice 
was delayed till the reign of Theodosius the Great. The relation 
of the emperor Constantine to the assembly was in itself a step 
in the direction of that independent treatment of ecclesiastical 
affairs, which, in the following centuries, created the peculiar 
type of the Byzantine state-church. 

From his accession Constantine had shown himself the friend 
of the Christians; and, when his victory over Licinius (a.d. 323) 
gave him undisputed possession of the crown, he adhered to 
this religious policy, distinguishing and fortifying the Christian 
cause by gratuities and grants of privilege. This propitiatory 
attitude originated in the fact that he recognized Christianity — 
which had successfully braved so many persecutions — as the 
most vital and vigorous of religions, and as the power of the 
future. Consequently he directed his energies toward the 
establishment of a positive relationship between it and the 
Roman state. But the Church could only maintain its great value 
for the politician by remaining the same compact organism which 
it had proved itself to be under the stormy reign of Diocletian. 
Scarcely, however, did it find itself in the enjoyment of external 
peace, when violent feuds broke out in its midst, whose extent, 
and the virulence with which they were waged, threatened to 
dismember the whole religious body. Donatism in the West was 
followed by the Arian struggle in the East. The former move- 
ment had been successfully arrested, though it survived in North 
Africa till the 5th century. The conflict kindled by the 
Alexandrian presbyter Arius (q.v.) assumed greater dimensions 
and a more formidable character. Constantine at first attempted 
to restore quiet in Alexandria by transmission of an epistle by 
Bishop Hosius of Cordova, but his admonitions were fruitless. 
Accordingly, since other debatable points* were at issue, he had 
recourse to an institution previously evolved by the Christian 
Church — the convocation of a synod to pronounce on burning 
questions — qualifying it, however, to correspond with the 
altered circumstances. He convened a council, designed to 
represent the whole Church of the empire, at Nicaea in Bithynia, 
a town situated no great way from the imperial summer-residence 
of Nicomedia and within easy reach by sea of the Oriental 
bishops. Among the various estimates of the number of dele- 
gates, the statement of Athanasius, who speaks of 318 members, 
has dominated the tradition. In consequence of the vast dis- 
tances, the West was but weakly represented. From Spain, 
Hosius — the above-mentioned bishop of Cordova — made his 
appearance; from Gaul, Nicasius of Dijon; from Dalmatia, 
Domnus of Stridon; from Italy, Marcus of Calabria with two 
presbyters as deputies of the Roman bishop Silvester; and from 
North Africa, Caecilian of Carthage. Thus an immense majority 
of the synod bailed from the East. The bishops of the three 
most' important metropolises were present — Alexander of 
Alexandria, Eustathius of Antioch and Macarius of Jerusalem — 
wbile a prominent r61e was also played by Eusebius, bishop of 
the imperial city Nicomedia, and his erudite namesake, Eusebius 
of Caesarea. Of the other prelates not a few had distinguished 
themselves as confessors in the later persecution, and still bore 
the honourable traces of their sufferings. Since the bishops 
were accompanied by priests, Nicaea witnessed an array of 
clerics such as had never before been mustered in a single place. 
Among the attendant clergy, the still youthful deacon Athanasius, 
destined to succeed Alexander in the see of Alexandria, was 
prominent as the most powerful antagonist of Arianism (see 
Athanasius). The synod met in the imperial palace from the 
20th of May to the 25th of July. What order of procedure 
obtained, and in whom the presidency was vested, are problems 
which admit of no certain solution: the one indisputable fact is 
that Constantine — who, at his appearance, was accorded a 
ceremonious reception, and himself delivered an address on the 
occasion — exercised a decided influence on the discussions. 

The deliberations on the Arian question passed through several 
distinct stages before the final condemnation of Arius and his 
doctrines was reached. A clearly defined standpoint with regard 
to this problem — the relationship of Christ to God — was held 
only by the attenuated group of Arians and a far from numerous 
section of delegates, who adhered with unshaken conviction to 
the Alexandrian view. The bulk of the members occupied a 
position between these two extremes. They rejected the 
formulae of Arius, and declined to accept those of bis opponents; 
that is to say, they were merely competent to establish negations, 
but lacked the capacity, as yet, to give their attitude of com- 
promise a positive expression. In the main they perpetuated 
the line of Origen. That the majority of the council should 
have adopted this neutral tendency is easily intelligible when 
we consider the state of theology at that period. True, at Nicaea 
this majority eventually acquiesced in the ruling of the Alex- 
andrians; yet this result was due, not to internal conviction, 
but partly to indifference, partly to the pressure of the imperial 
will — a fact which is mainly demonstrated by the subsequent 
history of the Arian conflicts. For if the Nicaean synod had 
arrived at its final decision by the conscientious agreement of all 
non-Arians, then the confession of faith there formulated might 
indeed have evoked the continued antagonism of the Arians, 
but must necessarily have been championed by all else. This, 
however, was not the case; in fact, the creed was assailed by 
those very bodies which had composed the laissez-faire centre at 
Nicaea; and we are compelled to the conclusion that, in this 
point, the voting was no criterion of the inward convictions of 
the council. 

In the synod, an Arian confession of faith was first brought 
forward and read; but it aroused such a storm of indignation 

xix. 21 

that obviously, in the interests of a restoration of ecclesiastical 
peace, there could be no question of its acceptance. On this, 
Eusebius of Caesarea submitted the baptismal creed of his 
community; and this met with the imperial approval. Since 
the creed dated from a period anterior to the outbreak of the 
Arian struggle, its reception would have been equivalent to a 
declaration on the part of the council that it declined to define 
its position with reference to the controversy of the hour. 
That the greater number of delegates were not disinclined to 
adopt this subterfuge, so congenial to their standpoint, and to 
shelve the actual solution of the whole problems by recognition 
of this or some similar neutral formula, is extremely probable. 
But the emperor manifestly saw that, if the difficulties were 
eluded in any such mode, it was inevitable from the very nature 
of the case, tbat they should rise again in an accentuated form, 
and that consequently no pacification could be expected from 
this policy. Since the Eastern Church subscribed to the Alex- 
andrian solution of the question, he drew the natural deduction 
and concluded that he had here a genuine presentment of the 
feeling of the Church, which, if it received official sanction, 
might be justly expected to restore peace to the Christian 
community. But, in pronouncing for this view, he was careful 
to dissociate himself from the formulation of a new confession:, 
for it was imperative to avoid even an apparent innovation in 
the articles of faith. Accordingly he proposed that the Caesarean 
creed should be modified by the insertion of the Alexandrian 
passwords — as if for the purpose of more accurate definition — 
and by the deletion of certain portions. That he appreciated the 
import of these alterations, or realized that this revision was 
virtually the proclamation of a new doctrine, is scarcely probable. 
The creed thus evolved — the expression dfxocixnos is of Western 
origin — was finally signed by all the deputies with the exception 
of the bishops Theonas of Marmarica and Secundus of Ptolemais: 
even the Arians had submitted. The two recalcitrant prelates, 
with the presbyter Arius, were banished to Illyria; Eusebius of 
Nicomedia and Theognis of Nicaea were also driven into exile, 
and at the same time the works of Arius were condemned to 
be burned under pain of death. 

But this artificial unity was no ratification of peace: in fact, 
it paved the way for a struggle which convulsed the whole 
empire. For it was the proclamation of the Nicene Creed that 
first opened the eyes of many bishops to the significance of the 
problem there treated; and its explanation led the Church to 
force herself, by the arduous .path of theological work, into 
compliance with those principles, enunciated at Nicaea, to 
which, in the year 325, she had pledged herself without genuine 
assent. 

In addition to the Arian impasse, there was the schism of 
Bishop Meletius of Lycopolis in the Thebaid, whose settlement 
Constantine had added to the programme of the council. He 
and Peter, bishop of Alexandria, had come into conflict over the 
treatment of the " backsliders " (lapsi) in the Diocletian persecu- 
tion; and their strife acquired additional bitterness from the 
fact that it was extended to cover the prerogatives of the 
Alexandrian bishopric. Peter had composed a treatise advocat- 
ing moderate principles and censuring the courtship of martyrdom 
for its own sake, then gone so far as to save himself by flight. 
Meletius, on the other hand, represented the most rigorous 
school, and allowed himself high-handed infringements of the 
law. When this had resulted in his deposition by a synod, a 
faction still adhered to him, and the Meletians became a schis- 
matic community; and such they remained even after the death 
of Peter (311), who demonstrated by bis martyrdom that his 
counsels of moderation were not prompted by cowardice. This 
Meletian schism made for disorder in the ecclesiastical life of 
Egypt all the more because its followers sided with Arius. The 
Nicene Council broke the strength of the movement by great 
concessions to the Meletian bishops, and, at the same time, 
expressly recognized the supreme rights of the Alexandrian see 
over Egypt, Libya and the Pentapolis. Since, in the resolution 
dealing with this point (canon vi.), reference was made to the 
analogous and undisputed suzerainty of the Roman see — over 
the ten suhurbican provinces, attached to the diocese of Rome 
and including middle and lower Italy, with the islands of Sicily, 
Corsica and Sardinia — this decision enshrines an important 
piece of evidence for the history of the papacy. On this oppor- 
tunity, his ancient privileges were restored to the bishop of 
Jerusalem, who, in consequence of the political history of 
the Holy Land, had heen subordinated to the metropolitan 
of Caesarea (canon vii.). The path was smoothed for the 
readmittance of the Novatians (Cathari) into the church, by 
recognizing, in this case, their clergy, with the hare stipulation 
that the laying-on of hands should follow their written promise 
to be faithful to the doctrine of the Catholic Church (canon viii.). 

With regard to the much-debated question as to the termina- 
tion of the Easter festival, the synod committed itself so far 
as to pronounce in favour of the Alexandrian cycle — a settle- 
ment which entailed such important results in practical life 
that it was communicated to the Christian churches by Con- 
stantine in a circular letter. The problem, whether a 
baptism, performed by heretics in the name of Christ or the 
Trinity, should rank as a baptism or not, had given rise to an 
animated controversy between the Roman bishop Stephen, 
who answered in the affirmative, and Cyprian of Carthage, who 
gave an equally decided negative. The council followed the 
Roman practice, merely declaring the nullity of baptisms 
imparted by the adherents of Paul of Samosata (canon xix.). 
An important provision, in point of ecclesiastical law, was that 
the chirotony of a bishop required the presence of at least three 
other bishops of his province, while the confirmation of the 
choice remained at the disposal of the metropolitan (canon iv.). 
A further regulation was that two provincial synods should be 
held annually (canon v.) ; but a law enacting the celibacy of the 
clergy was rejected at Nicaea, since Paphnutius; an aged bishop 
of Egypt who had been tested in persecution, warned his col- 
leagues against the danger of imposing too arduous a yoke upon 
the priesthood, and defended the sanctity of marriage. 

As Constantine had convened the synod, so he determined 
its conclusion. A brilliant banquet in the imperial palace — of 
which Eusebius of Caesarea gives an enthusiastic account- 
marked its close, after which the hishops were granted their 
return. The admonitions to peace with which he dismissed 
them proved unavailing for the reasons indicated above: but 
the reputation of the first oecumenical council suffered no 
abatement in consequence.

NICANDER (2nd cent. B.C.), Greek poet, physician and 
grammarian, was born at Claros, near Colophon, where his 
family held the hereditary priesthood of Apollo. He flourished 
under Attalus III. of Pergamum. He wrote a number of works 
both in prose and verse, of which two are preserved. The longest, 
Tkeriaca, is an hexameter poem (958 lines) on the nature of 
venomous animals and the wounds which they inflict. The 
other, Alexipharmaca, consists of 630 hexameters treating of 
poisons and their antidotes. In his facts Nicander followed 
the physician Apollodorus. Among his lost works may be 
mentioned: Aetolica, a prose history of Aetolia; Heteroeumena, 
a mythological epic, used by Ovid in the Metamorphoses and 
epitomized by Antoninus Liberalis; Georgica and Melissourgica, 
of which considerable fragments are preserved, said to have 
been imitated by Virgil (Quintilian x. 1. 56). The works of 
Nicander were praised by Cicero (De oratore, i. 16), imitated by 
Ovid, and frequently quoted by Pliny and other writers. His 
reputation does not seem justified; his works, as Plutarch 
says (De audiendis poetis, 16), have nothing poetical about 
them except the metre, and the style is bombastic and obscure; 
but they contain some interesting information as to ancient 
belief on the subjects treated.

NICANOR, Greek grammarian, son of Hermeias of Alexandria 
(or Hierapolis), lived during the reign of Hadrian. He chiefly 
devoted himself to the study of punctuation and the difference 
of meaning caused by it. Hence he was nicknamed " the 
Punctuator " (6 (rriyjmrias). He is known to have written 
on the punctuation of Homer and Callimachus. He was possibly

NICARAGUA, a republic of Central America, bounded on the 
N. by Honduras, E. by the Caribbean Sea, S. by Costa Rica, 
and W. by the Pacific Ocean (for map, see Central America). 
Pop. (1905), about 550,000; area, 49,200 sq. m. Nicaragua 
forms an irregular equilateral triangle with its base stretching 
for 280 m. along the Caribbean Sea from Cape Gracias a Dios ' 
southwards to the San Juan delta, and its apex at the Coseguina 
volcano, on the Bay of Fonseca, which separates Nicaragua 
on the Pacific side from Salvador. The frontier which separates 
the republic from Honduras extends across the continent from 
east-north-east to west-south-west. It is defined by the river 
Segovia for about one-third of the distance, or from Cape Gracias 
a Dios to 86° W.; it then deflects across the watershed on the 
east and south of the Hondurian river Choluteca, crosses the 
main Nicaraguan cordillera (mountain chain), and follows the 
river Negro to the Bay of Fonseca. In accordance with the 
treaty of 1858, which was confirmed in 1888 by the United States 
president, acting as arbitrator, and more fully defined in 1896, 
the boundary towards Costa Rica is drawn 2 m. S. of the San 
Juan river and Lake Nicaragua, as far as a point parallel to the 
centre of the western shore of the lake. It is then continued 
south-westward for the. short distance which intervenes between 
this point and the northernmost headland of Salinas Bay, on 
the Pacific. 

Physical Features. — The coasts of Nicaragua are strikingly 
different in configuration. The low, swampy and monotonous 
shore of the Caribbean, with its numerous lagoons and estuaries, 
and its fringe of reefs and islets, contains only three harbours: 
Gracias a Dios, Bluefields or Blewfields, and Greytown (San 
Juan del Norte). Its length, from Cape Gracias a Dios to the 
San Juan delta, is nearly 300 m. The Pacific coast, measuring • 
some 200 m. from the Bay of Fonseca to Salinas Bay, is bold, 
rocky and unbroken hy any great indentation; here, however, 
are the best harbours of the republic — the southern arm of the 
Bay of Fonseca (q.v.), Corinto, Brito and San Juan del Sur. 

The surface of the country is naturally divided into five clearly 
distinct zones: (1) the series of volcanic peaks which extend parallel 
to the Pacific at a little distance inland ; (2) the plains and lakes of 
the great depression which lies to the east of these mountains and 
stretches from sea to sea, between the Bay of Fonseca and the 
mouths of the San Juan; (3) the main cordillera, which skirts the 
depression on the east, and trends north-west from Monkey Point or 
Punta Mico on the Caribbean Sea, until it is merged in the ramifica- 
tions of the Hondurian and Salvadorian highlands; (4) the plateaus 
which slope gradually away from the main cordillera towards the 
Caribbean; (5) the east or Mosquito coast.with its low-lying hinter- 
land. The last-named region has to a great extent had a separate 
history; and it was only in 1894 that the Mosquito Reserve, a central 
enclave which includes more than half of the littoral and hinterland, 
was incorporated in the republic and renamed the department of 
Zelaya. (See Mosquito Coast.) 

Though situated almost on the western edge of the country, and 
greatly inferior, both in continuity and in mean altitude, to the main 
cordillera, the chain of volcanic cones constitutes a watershed quite 
equal in importance to the cordillera itself. It consists for the most 
part of isolated igneous peaks, sometimes connected by low interven- 
ing ridges. It terminates in the extreme north-west with Coseguina 
(2831 ft.), and in the extreme south-east with the low wooded archi- 
pelagos of Solentiname and Chichicaste near the head of the San 
Juan river. Between these two extremes the chief cones, proceeding 
southwards, are: the Maribios chain, comprising El Viejo (584° ft-)i 
Santa Clara. Telica, Orota, Las Pilas, Axosco, Momotombo (4127 ft.), 
all crowded close together between the Bay of Fonesca and Lake 
Managua; Masaya or Popocatepac (which was active in 1670, 1782, 
1857 and 1902, and attains a height of 2972 ft.), and Mombacho 
(4593 ft*)» near Granada; lastly, in Lake Nicaragua the two islands 
of Zapatcra and Ometepe or Omotepec with its twin peaks Ometepe 
(5643 ft.) and Madera. On the 20th of January 1835 Coseguina was 
the scene of one of the most tremendous eruptions on record. The 
outbreak lasted four days and the volcanic dust and ashes eruoted fell 
over a vast area, which comprised Jamaica, southern Mexico and 
Bogota. After a long repose Ometepe also burst into renewed 
activity on the 19th of June 1883, when the lavas from a new crater 
began to overflow and continued for seven days to spread in various 
directions over the whole island. In the Maribios district occur 
several volcanic lakelets, such as that of Masaya, besides numerous 
infernillos, low craters or peaks still emitting sulphurous vapour and 
smoke, and at night often lighting up the whole land with bluish 
flames. 

In the great lacustrine depression of Nicaragua is collected all the 
drainage trom the eastern versant of the volcanic mountains, from 
the sheer western escarpment of the main cordillera, and from a large 
area of northern Costa Rica, The only river which flows out of the 
depression on the north enters the Bay of Fonseca at Tcmpisque. 
The accumulated waters which pour down into the depression are 

fithered into the two basins of Lake Managua and Lake Nicaragua, 
oth basins have a maximum depth of some 260 ft. Lake Managua, 
the more northerly, has a length of 30 m. and varies in breadth from 
8 to 16 m. Its area is about 575 sq. m. After the rains a portion of 
its overflow escapes southwards into the lower and larger Lake 
"Nicaragua, through the Panaloya channel. Steamers ply on both 
lakes, but the channel is rendered impassable by a rapid near the 
town of Tipitapa, at its northern extremity. Here there is a water- 
fall of 13 ft. The existence of ancient lacustrine beaches, upheaved 
between the two basins by volcanic agencies or left dry by some 
enlargement of the San Juan outfall, and a consequent subsidence of 
the water-level, seems to indicate that th*e lakes were formerly united. 
Now, however, Lake Managua is almost a closed basin in the dry 
season, when the stream in parts of the Panaloya channel sinks to a 
mere rivulet. The surface of Lake Nicaragua after the rains is 110 ft. 
above sea-level. The lake is 100 m. long, and has a maximum 
breadth of 45 m. and an area ot 2970 sq, m. It is thus the largest 
sheet of fresh water between Lake Michigan and Lake Titicaca on the 
borders of Bolivia and Peru ; Towards the San Juan outlet its depth 
decreases to 6 or 8 ft., owing to the vast accumulation of the silt 
washed down into the lake by its principal Costa Rican affluent, the 
Rio Frio. Much of this silt is again carried away by the San Juan. 
Under the influence of the intermittent trade-winds Lake Nicaragua 
rises and falls regularly, whence the popular notion that it was a 
tidal lake. It is also exposed to the dangerous Papagayos tornadoes, 
caused by the prevailing north-easterly winds meeting opposite 
currents from the Pacific. It is drained on the south by the San 
Juan river, which flows generally east by south to the Caribbean Sea. 
The distance from the lake to the principal or Colorado mouth of the 
river is 95 m., and the average width of the channel 1500 ft. Near its 
mouth the main stream branches out into a wide delta. Navigation 
is greatly impeded by shifting banks of silt, and especially by five 
rarjids which can only be traversed when the river is in full flood. 
It is often asserted that these rapids were artificially formed by the 
Spaniards themselves to prevent the buccaneers from penetrating to 
Lake Nicaragua, But Herrera (Dec. iii. book 2, chap, 3) speaks of 
the " great rocks and (alls " which prevented Cordova, the first 
circumnavigator of the lake, from descending the San Juan in 1522 ; 
and although the English traveller Gage states that in his time (17th 
century) vessels reached Granada direct from Spain, there can be 
little doubt that the rapids arc natural obstructions. The various 
schemes which have been put forward for the conversion of the San 
Juan and the lacustrine depression into an interoceanic waterway arc 
fully discussed under Panama Canal. 

The main Nicaraguan cordillera, which flanks the depression on 
the east, has often been called the Cordillera de los Andes, from its 
supposed continuity with the mountain-chains of Panama and the 
west coast of South America. There is in fact no such continuity, for 
the San Juan valley completely separates the mountains of Panama 
from the main Nicaraguan system. This severance, it is truc.^ may 
be geologically recent, and some geologists see, in the five rapids of 
the San Juan, remnants of a connecting ridge which the river has 
swept away. But the evidence for past continuity is inconclusive, 
while there can be no doubt about the present severance of the two 
mountain systems. The main cordillera bears different names in 
different parts of Nicaragua, Thus the important section which 
terminates at Monkey Point is commonly called the Cordillera dc 
Yolaina. The summits of the main cordillera seem nowhere to 
exceed 7000 ft. in altitude; the mean elevation is probably less 
than 2000 ft.; the declivity is sheer towards the lakes, and gradual 
towards the Caribbean. Along the shores of the lakes the cordillera 
may be described as a double range, consisting of two series of ridges 
divided by a great longitudinal valley. The lower series, which 
adjoins the lakes, rises near Lake Managua, and marches parallel to 
the main crest of the cordillera as far as the northern base of the 
Yolaina section ; it then diverges, trending south-east nearly as far 
as Grcytown, while the axis of the Yolaina section has a more easterly 
direction. 

On the cast, the main cordillera abuts upon the region of plateaus 
and savannas, which occupies nearly half of the area of Nicaragua. 
It is likely that this region was once a single uniform tableland, 
sloping by degrees to the flat Mosquito Coast, in which direction its 
level still sinks. But the relief of the tableland has been wholiy 
changed by fluvial action. The great rivers which flow eastward to 
the sea have fissured and moulded the surface into deep ravines alter- 
nating with high plateaus, ridges and isolated hills. Large tracts of 
these uplands nave never been adequately explored, and consist of 
virgin forest and prairie. The principal river is the Segovia, which 
rises in the main cordillera due north of Lake Managua, winds E.N.E. 
as far as 85 W., and constitutes the frontier until it reaches the sea 
at Cape Gracias a Dios, after a course of more than 450 m,, during 
which it receives many tributaries. Its basin is narrow and its 
volume not remarkable, but in length it surpasses all other Central 
American rivers. Its nomenclature, like that of many lesser streams 
in the plateau region, is somewhat confusing; for while the Spanish 
colonists were settling beside its headwaters the mid-stream was 
hardly known except to the native Indians, and the lower reaches 
were frequented by buccaneers, often of British or Dutch origin. In 
addition to the three names of Segovia, Coco or Cocos, and Wanks, 
which are applicable to the whole river, different parts have from 
time to time received the names of Cabullal, Cabrugal, Cape River, 
Encucntro, Gracias, Herbias, Oro, Pantasma, Portillo Liso, Tapacac, 
Telpaneca, Somoro, Yankes, Yare and Yoro. Other important 
streams, all flowing to the Caribbean in a direction E. by S., are the 
Hueso, Wawa, Cuculaia, Prinzapolca, Rio Grande, Bluefields and 
Rama. The Rio Grande or Amaltara, which receives one large 
tributary, the Tuma, is navigable for about 100 m. The Bluefields, 
Blewfields, Escondida, or Rio del Desastre, which derives its best- 
known name from that of B lie veldt, a Dutch corsair, is navigable for 
65 m. The hydrography of Nicaragua is curious in two respects: 
as in the Amazonian region all the large rivers flow east, none escap- 
ing to the Pacific; and the main watershed does not correspond with 
the main cordillera, which is inferior in this particular both to the 
volcanic mountains and to the plateau region. 

The geology, fauna and flora of Nicaragua may be studied in 
connexion with those of the neighbouring countries (see Central 
America). 

Climate. — The climate is mild and healthy for Europeans on the 
uplands, such as those of Segovia and C ho n tales, which have a mean 
elevation of 2000 to 3000 ft. above sea-level. But elsewhere it is 
distinctly tropical, with two seasons — wet from May to November 
on the Pacific slope, and from June to December on the Caribbean, 
and dry throughout the winter months. The mean annual tempera- 
ture is about 8o° Fahr., falling to 70 at night and rising to 90 at 
noon in summer. Nicaragua comes within the zone of the wet north- 
east trade- winds, which sweep inland from the Atlantic. The rain- 
fall is heavy along the west side of the lacustrine basin, with an annual 
mean at Rivas of 102 in., but this figure is sometimes greatly exceeded 
on the east coast, where rain is common even in the dry season. 
Observations made at Greytown in 1890 showed the extremes of 
temperature to be 89 Fahr. in September for the maximum and 
70 Fahr. in January for the minimum; the rainfall for the whole 
year amounted to 297 in., the rainiest month having been July 
(52-5 in,) and the driest, May^ (4-9 in.). Earthquakes are felt at times 
on the Pacific slope, but in Nicaragua they are less violent than in the 
neighbouring countries. 

Inhabitants. — Accurate statistics as to the growth and distri- 
bution of the population cannot be obtained, and the figures 
given below are based on estimates which can only be approxi- 
mately correct. The census of 1882 gave the total as 275,816; 
this appears to have risen in 1890 to 375,000, in 1900 to 500,000, 
and in 1905 to 550,000, or 11 inhabitants per sq. m. There can 
thus be no doubt that the population is increasing with extra- 
ordinary rapidity, although there is hardly any immigration. 
The number of Europeans and their pure-blooded descendants 
is about 1200, and tends to increase. Spanish and German 
elements preponderate in the foreign colonies. The most densely 
peopled region and the focus of civilization is the lacustrine 
depression and the surrounding uplands. Here are all the large 
towns, and hither European settlers were attracted from the 
first by the temperate climate, rich soil, and natural waterways. 
The development of Nicaragua, unlike that of most American 
countries (notably Brazil and the United States), has been from 
west to east. The great mass of the population is a composite 
race, descended chiefly from the native " Indians," their Spanish 
conquerors, many of whom were Galicians, and the negro slaves 
introduced during the colonial period. Intermarriage with 
British, Dutch, and French with Caribsand Creoles has further 
complicated the ethnology of the country, producing " Indians " 
with fair hair and blue eyes, and half-castes with European 
features and Indian or negroid coloration, or with European 
coloration and Indian or negroid features. The prevailing 
language is a degenerate form of Spanish, nearer to Galician than 
to Castilian. Most of the native dialects have ceased to exist, 
but a corrupt form of English is spoken on parts of the east 
coast. All who speak Spanish are classed as Ladinos; the 
half-castes generally are termed Mestizos; and the name of 
Sambos or Zambos is confined to the descendants of Indian and 
negro parents; these are also incorrectly called Caribs. The 
number of the uncivilized Indians, whose camps or villages are 
situated in open glades among the forests of the plateau region, 
is usually estimated at 30,000; but this would seem to be an 
exaggeration. Pure-blooded Indians are not numerous, as whole 
districts were depopulated and whole tribes exterminated by the 
Spanish colonists and the buccaneers. A few may be descendants 
of the Aztecs and Mayas, whose temples, sculptures, burial- 
grounds, &c, have not yet been fully explored. For a general 
account of this ancient civilization and of the Indian tribes see 
Central America and Mexico: Archaeology, A collection of 
Nicaraguan antiquities is preserved in the. National Museum 
at Washington, U.S.A.; and the archaeological collection 
brought to Europe by Dr W. Lehmann in 1910 was exhibited in 
the Berlin Museum of Fine Arts. 

Chief Towns and Communications, — The capital is Managua (pop. 
1905, about 30,000); other important towns are Leon (45,000), 
Granada (25,000), Masaya (20,000), Chinandega (12,000), and the 
seaports of Corinto (3000) and Grey town (2500). These are de- 
scribed in separate articles. At the beginning of the 20th century, 
Nicaragua had few good roads, and none at all east of the main 
Cordillera. Transport in the plateau region was mainly effected by 
means of pack mules, over the roughest of tracks. But between 
1900 and 1905 contracts were signed for the construction of three 
highways, leading respectively from Matagalpa, from Nueva Segovia 
and from the Pis Pis mining district to the head of steam navigation 
on the Segovia, about 160 m. above Cape Gracias. These highways 
were to be linked to the western system by 79 m. of road connecting 
Matagalpa with^Momotombo. For the construction and upkeep of 
roads a tax varying from one to ten pesos is levied on all males over 
eighteen years old. There are 160 m. of state railways, running from 
Corinto to Leon, Managua, Granada and Diriamba, with branches to 
El Viejo and Momotombo. Contracts for additional lines were signed 
between 1900 and 1905. The steamers which ply on the great lakes 
and the San Juan^ besides other vessels which visit the principal 
Caribbean and Pacific ports, are national property; but from the 1st 
of January 1905 all the state railways were leased to a syndicate for 
fifteen yearsand the steamers for twenty-five years. There are also 
20^ m. of private railway near the mouth of the Rio Grande, and 
private steam tramways on the western shore of Lake Nicaragua. 
Corinto is the headquarters of shipping; it is visited by two-thirds 
of the 2100 vessels of 550,000 tons (including coasters) which annually 
enter the ports of the republic. The coasting trade is restricted to 
vessels under the Nicaraguan flag. At the beginning of the 20th 
century most of the ocean-going steamers were owned in Germany 
or the United States; British enterprise being chiefly represented 
by schooners trading from Jamaica to Bmefields and Greytown. 
Nicaragua joined the postal union in 1882, and the western provinces 
have a fairly complete telegraphic and telephonic system. 

Industries and Commerce. — The principal agricultural product is 
coffee, the yield of which increased from 4,528,300 lb in 1880 to 
11,382,000 ft) in 1^90, and 26,400,000 lb in 1900. Coffee is grown 
principally in the Matagalpa region, on the uplands of the interior. 
The plantations are chiefly owned and managed by Germans, and 
the product is of good quality; but coffee-planting, like most 
Nicaraguan industries, suffers from the scarcity of labour. On the 
Caribbean coast bananas are cultivated and largely exported to the 
United States. In 1903 more than 2,000,000 bunches were consigned 
to New Orleans. The cultivation of cotton has been often attempted, 
but with little success. Sugar is grown and there are many small 
sugar factories, but little of the output is exported. The cocoa 
export is also small; tobacco, rice, beans and other crops are grown 
for local use. Rubber is collected in the forests, and plantations 
have been formed. Dye-woods and indigo are exported, but the 
demand for vegetable dyes has decreased. Cattle-rearing is success- 
fully pursued, live cattle and hides being important articles of 
export. Cheese and butter are manufactured in large quantities 
for home consumption. Horses and pigs are also reared, but not 
sheep. In 1899 the government sold about 52,000 acres of public 
land lying about 18 m. E. of Lake Nicaragua for the purpose 
of colonization. The purchaser undertook to introduce settlers from 
northern Europe, to import cattle for the improvement of the 
Nicaraguan breed, to plant rubber and vanilla, and to provide 
schools for agricultural instruction. The sale of Nicaraguan spirits is 
a state monopoly. From the 1st of January 1904 it was leased to a 
syndicate of distillers for six years. Gold-mining is carried on along 
the Caribbean littoral. In 1898 the gold dust and bar exports from 
Bluefields were of the value of £25,760; in 1900, £62,000; and in 
1 9°7t £65,000. Copper, coal, petroleum, silver and precious stones 
are also found, and there seems little reason to doubt that the mineral 
resources of Nicaragua, though undeveloped, are nearly as rich as 
those of Honduras. Other industries include manufactures of 
leather, boots and shoes, furniture, bricks and pottery, cigars and 
cigarettes, beer, wine and spirits, candles and soap. The largest and 
most numerous commercial firms are German, but there are also 
French, British, and even Chinese establishments, although the im- 
migration of Chinese is prohibited by law. The principal exports are 
(in order of value) coffee, bananas, gold, rubber, cattle and hides, 
dye-woods and cabinet woods. The principal imports are cotton 
and woollen goods, machinery and hardware, flour, beer, wine, 
spirits and drugs. The United States and Great Britain send 
respectively 60% and 20% of the imports, receiving 60% and 
8 % of the exports. The average yearly value of the foreign trade 
is about £1,200,000 — exports, £700,000; imports, £500,000. 

Money, Weights and Measures, —There is one bank of issue, the 
Bank of London and Central America, which has a capital of 
£260,000 (£130,300 paid). The monetary unit is the silver peso or 
dollar of 100 cents, which weighs 25 grammes, ^900 fine. The current 
coin consists largely of Mexican and Central and South American 
dollars; but little coin is in circulation. The currency is mostly 
paper, notes being issued directly by the treasury and by the bank. 
The notes issued by the bank must be covered to the extent of 40 % 
by gold and silver; the actual bank reserve is stated to be from 65 
to 100 % of the notes issued. The value of the paper peso fluctuates ; 
in 1904 the premium on gold stood at 640%. The value of the silver 
peso in fractional silver money is about nineteen pence; in a single 
coin about twenty pence. The exportation of silver pesos is pro- 
hibited. In 1899 a nickel coinage was introduced. The metric 
system of weights and measures was legalized in January 1893. 

Finance.— The revenue of the republic is derived mainly from 
customs duties, liquor, tobacco and slaughter taxes, railways and 
steamers, the postal and telegraph services, and the gunpowder 
monopoly. The principal spending departments are those of war 
and marine, internal development, and finance. The published 
accounts, however, present no continuous or clear view of the 
national receipts anddisbursements. Revenue and expenditure vary 
considerably, but neither often falls below £300,000 or rises above 
£500,000. In 1886 the republic contracted a railway loan in London 
to the amount of £285,000 at 6% interest, and in July 1894 the 
interest fell into default. In 1895 an arrangement was made for the 
reduction of interest to 4%, the beginning of amortization, and the 
creation of " coffee warrants " to be used in the payment of export 
duties on coffee assigned for the service of the debt. In the four years 
1 897-1900 the sales of these warrants amounted to 1,028,990 gold 
pesos or (at 23d., the average rate for this period) £98,610. In July 
1905 the outstanding amount of the debt was £253,600. In 1905 a 
further loan of 12,500,000 francs (£500,000) was raised in Paris at 
5 %. The internal debt amounts to about £400,000. 

Constitution and Administration. — The former constitution, 
proclaimed on the 4th of July 1894 and amended on the 10th of 
December 1896, was superseded on the 30th of March 1905, 
when a new constitution was promulgated. By this instrument 
the legislative power is vested in a single chamber of 36 members 
(instead of 40, as under the old constitution), elected by universal 
male suffrage for six years (instead of two). The executive is 
entrusted to a president similarly chosen for six years (instead of 
four) and aided by a cabinet representing the five ministries of 
foreign affairs and education, 'finance, internal administration 
and justice, war and marine, and public works. For adminis- 
trative purposes the republic is divided into 13 departments and 
2 comarcas, each under a political head who acts as military 
commandant and controls education, finance, &c. The ad- 
ministration of justice is entrusted to numerous courts of first 
instance, three courts of appeal, and a supreme court. The 
active army of 4000 men can be increased to 40,000 in war. 
All able-bodied citizens between the ages of seventeen and fifty- 
five are compelled to serve one year with the colours and are 
then enrolled in the reserve. Roman Catholicism is the prevailing 
creed, but all religions are tolerated, and none receives any en- 
dowment or other special privilege from the state. The bishop 
of Leon, whose diocese is included in the archiepiscopal province 
of Guatemala, is the spiritual head of the Roman Catholics. 
There are numerous elementary schools, at which the teaching is 
free and compulsory, besides ten colleges for secondary or 
technical education, and two universities. 

History. — For a general account of the Spanish administration 
during the colonial period, i.e. up to 1821, and of the subsequent 
attempts to unite all the Central American republics in a single 
federal state, see Central America. The history of the Mosquito 
Reserve and of the relations between Nicaragua and Great 
Britain is told in full under Mosquito Coast. 

First discovered by Columbus in 1502, Nicaragua was not 
regularly explored till 1522, when Gil Gonzalez Davila pene- 
trated from the Gulf of Nicoya to the western provinces 
and sent his lieutenant Cordova to circumnavigate the great 
lake. The country is said to take its name from Nicaras or 
Nicaragua (also written Micaragua), a powerful Cholutec chief, 
ruling over most of the land between the lakes and the Pacific, 
who received Davila in a friendly spirit and accepted baptism 
at his hands. Nicaragua's capital seems to have occupied the 
site of the present town of Rivas. The Spaniards overran the 
country with great rapidity, both from this centre northwards, 
and southwards from the Honduras coast. The occupation 
began with sanguinary conflicts between the two contending 
waves of intrusion. Granada was founded in 1524 on the 
isthmus between the two lakes as the capital of a separate 
government, which, however, was soon attached as a special 
province to the captaincy general of Guatemala, which comprised 
the whole of Central America and the present Mexican state of 
Chiapas. Hence, during the Spanish tenure, the history of 
Nicaragua is merged in that of the surrounding region. Of its 
five earliest rulers " the first had been a murderer, the second 
a murderer and rebel, the third murdered the second, the fourth 
was a forger, the fifth a murderer and rebel " (Boyle). Then came 
the hopeless revolts of the Indians against intolerable oppression, 
the abortive rebellions of Hernandez de Contreras and John 
Bermejo (Bermudez) against the mother country (1550), the 
foundation, of Leon, future rival of Granada, in 1610, its sack 
by the buccaneers under William Dampier in 1685, and, lastly, 
the declaration of independence (1821), not definitively acknow- 
ledged by Spain till 1850. 

In 1823 Nicaragua joined the Federal Union of the five Central 
American states, which was dissolved in 1839. While it lasted 
Nicaragua was the scene of continual bloodshed, caused partly 
by its attempts to secede from the confederacy, partly by its 
wars with Costa Rica for the possession of the disputed territory 
of Guanacaste between the great lake and the Gulf of Nicoya, 
partly also by the bitter rivalries of the cities of Leon and 
Granada, respective headquarters of the Liberal and Conservative 
parties. During the brief existence of the Federal Union no 
fewer than three hundred and ninety-six persons exercised the 
supreme power of the republic and the different states. The 
independent government of Nicaragua was afterwards dis- 
tinguished almost beyond all other Spanish-American states by 
an uninterrupted series of military or popular revolts, by which 
the whole people was impoverished and debased. One out- 
standing incident was the filibustering expedition of William 
Walker (q.v.)j who was at first invited by the Liberals of Leon to 
assist them against the Conservatives of Granada, and who, 
after seizing the supreme power in 1856, was expelled by the 
combined forces of the neighbouring states, and on venturing 
to return was shot at Trujillo in Honduras on the 12th of 
September i860. 

Under the administration of Chamorro, who became president 
in 1875, a difficulty with Germany occurred. The German 
government asserted that one of its consuls had been insulted, 
*and demanded an indemnity of $30,000 (about £2800), a demand 
to which Nicaragua only submitted after all her principal ports 
had been blockaded. The successor of President Chamorro was 
General Zavala, whose administration brought Nicaragua to a 
higher degree of prosperity than she had ever known. He was 
succeeded in 1883 by Dr Cardenas, during whose presidency the 
attempt of General Barrios to unite the five Central American 
states was a cause of war between Guatemala and Honduras on 
one side, and Salvador, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica on the other. 
Cardenas had taken command of the united Nicaraguan and Costa 
Rican army when Barrios died, and on the nth of April 1885 
a treaty of peace was signed. Don Evaristo Carazo succeeded 
Dr Cardenas as president of the republic in 1887, but died when 
he had served a little over two years, and was succeeded by 
Dr Roberto Sacasa. Under Carazo *s administration the boundary 
question between Nicaragua and Costa Rica had been settled 
by arbitration, the president of the United States acting as arbi- 
trator. While Dr Sacasa was president of Honduras, Salvador 
and Guatemala signed a treaty, under which the United States of 
Central America were to be formed. The president of Nicaragua 
adhered to this treaty, but the National Congress refused to 
ratify it. Sacasa was overthrown by a revolution in 1893, and 
was succeeded by a provisional government, which in its turn 
was deposed soon after by another uprising, at the head of 
which was General Jos6 Santos Zelaya. His position was 
regularized by the constitution of 1S94, and he was re-elected 
president in 1898 for another term of four years. Under his 
government the incorporation of the Mosquito Reserve into the 
territory of Nicaragua took place. In 1895 occurred the Hatch 
incident, which led to the occupation of the port of Corinto by a 
British fleet. Mr Hatch, British pro-vice-consul at Bluefields, 
being accused of conspiracy against the Nicaraguan government, 
was arrested, along with other British subjects, and expelled. 
For this action Nicaragua was required to pay an indemnity of 
$15,000. An attempt to overthrow Zelaya was made in February 
1896, but it was crushed after several months of severe fighting. 
There were occasional disturbances subsequently, but none 
sufficient to overturn President Zelaya, who was again re- 
elected in 1902 and 1906. In 1907 he carried to a successful 
issue the war which broke out in that year between Nicaragua 
and Honduras (q.v.). But he was believed to be planning the 
conquest of other Central American states,- and his policy of 
granting monopolies and commercial concessions to his own 
supporters aroused widespread discontent. In October 1909 
an insurrection broke out in the Atlantic departments. The 
execution (after , alleged torture) of two citizens of the United 
States named Grace and Cannon, who were said to have fought 
in the revolutionary army under General Estrada, led to the 
despatch of United States warships to Nicaragua; but in the 
absence of full evidence President Zelaya 's responsibility for the 
execution could not be proved. 1 On the 1st of December the 
United States broke off diplomatic relations with Nicaragua, 
and in an official note Secretary Knox described the Zelayan 
administration as a " blot on the history " of the republic. Fight- 
ing at Bluefields was prevented by the U.S. cruiser " Des Moines " 
(18th December), an example followed at Grey town by the 
British cruiser "Scylla"; but elsewhere along the Atlantic 
coast the insurgents gained many victories. In the battle of 
Rama (23rd December) they captured the greater part of the 
government troops. On the following day Zelaya took refuge 
on board a Mexican gunboat, and sailed for Mexico. Dr Madriz, 
one of his supporters, had already succeeded him as president.

NICCOLI, NICCOLO DE* (1363-1437), Italian humanist, 
was born and died at Florence. He was one of the chief figures 
in the company of learned men which gathered round Cosimo 
de' Medici, who played the part of Augustus to Niccoli's Maecenas. 
Niccoli's chief services to classical literature consisted in his 
work as a copyist and collator of ancient MSS.; he corrected 
the text, introduced divisions into chapters, and made tables 
of contents. His lack of critical faculty was compensated by 
his excellent taste; in Greek (of which he knew very little) 
he had the assistance of Ambrogio Traversari. Many of the 
most valuable MSS. in the Laurentian library are by his hand, 
amongst them those of Lucretius and of twelve comedies of Plautus. 
Niccoli's private library was the largest and best in Florence; 
he also possessed a small but valuable collection of ancient 
works of art, coins and medals. He regarded himself as an 
infallible critic, and could not bear the slightest contradiction; 
his quarrels with Filelfo, Guarino and especially with Traversari 
created a great sensation in the learned world at the time. His 
hypercritical spirit (according to his enemies, his ignorance of 
the language) prevented him from writing or speaking in Latin; 
his sole literary work was a short tract in Italian on Latin 
Orthography, which he withdrew from circulation after it had 
been violently attacked by Guarino.

NICCOLITE, a mineral consisting of nickel arsenide, NiAs, 
containing 43*9% nickel and 56' 1 % arsenic. Crystals are hex- 
agonal, but are rare and indistinct. It usually occurs as 
compact masses. A characteristic feature is the pale copper- 
red colour, with metallic lustre, on the uneven fractured surfaces. 
It is opaque and brittle, and the streak is brownish-black. The 
specific gravity is 7*5, and the hardness 5 J. Small quantities 
of sulphur, iron and cobalt are usually present, and sometimes 
the arsenic is largely replaced by antimony. Antimonial varieties 
are known as arite, and form a passage to the isomorphous 
species breithauptite (nickel antimonide). Niccolite occurs with 
ores of cobalt, silver and copper at Annaberg and Schneeberg 
in Saxony, at Sangerhausen and Mansfeld in Prussian Saxony 
and other localities; it has occasionally been found in Cornwall 
and Scotland. The original arite (aarite) is from Mount Ar 
(Aar) near Pic du Midi d'Ossau in the Pyrenees. 

The names niccolite (J. D. Dana, 1868) and nickeline (F. 
S. Beudant, 1832) refer to the presence of nickel (Lat. niccolum). 
Owing to its copper-red colour the mineral is commonly called 
" copper-nickel," the German equivalent of which, Kupfernickel, 
was used as early as 1694. (L. J. S.) 


NICE, a city of France, the chief town of the department 
of the Alpes Maritimcs, and previous to i860 the capital of 
the county of Nice (Nizza) in the kingdom of Sardinia, 739 m. 
by rail from Paris. Pop. (1901) 127,027, of whom 105,109 
were permanent residents; in winter-time there is a large 
influx of visitors. It occupies a fine position at the mouth of 
the Paillon (Paglione); a stream (often dried up in summer) 
which, after a course of 20 m., enters the northern end of the 
Baie dcs Anges. A steep isolated limestone hill, 308 ft. in 
height, running back for some distance from the shore, forms 
the historical nucleus of the town. Formerly crowned by a 
' castle, which, previous to its destruction by the duke of Berwick 
in 1706, was one of the strongest fortresses on the coast, it is 
now laid out as a public pleasure-ground, and planted with 
aloe, cactus, agave and palm. Towards its south-west corner 
stands a tower (Tour Bellanda or Clerissy) dating, it is said, 
from the 5th century. The old town stretches along the western 
base of the hill; the " town of the 18th century " occupies the 
ground farther west, which slopes gently towards the Paillon; 
and away to the north-east and north and west beyond the 
stream lie the ever-growing quarters of the modern city. To 
the east of the hill, and thus out of sight of the more fashionable 
districts, the commercial quarter surrounds the port. The 
whole frontage of Nice is composed of fine embankments: the 
Quai des Ponchettes, constructed in 1770 round the base of 
the castle hill, is continued westward by the Quai du Midi to the 
public gardens and the municipal casino, whence the Promenade 
des Anglais (so called because it was begun in 182 2-1 824 at 
the cost oi the English colony), a boulevard 85 ft. wide, extends 
for more than a mile to the mouth of the Magnan, and in 
1904 was prolonged to the Var. A pier projecting into the 
sea from the promenade contains a " crystal palace." The 
course of the Paillon also is embanked on both sides, and at 
one part the Place Massena, one of the largest public squares 
in the city, and the principal resort of foreign visitors, and the 
Avenue Massena (leading thence to the Promenade des Anglais) 
have been laid out across the stream. Besides a Roman Catholic 
cathedral — Ste Reparate, dating from 1650 — Nice possesses 
two Russian churches, two synagogues and an Anglican chapel. 
Architecturally the most remarkable church is Notre Dame 
du Voeu, a modern Gothic building with two towers 213 ft. 
high, erected by the town in 1835 to commemorate its preserva- 
tion from cholera. The secular buildings include the town 
hall, the prefecture, the theatres, the hospitals, the lycee (founded 
by the Jesuits in the 17th century), the natural history museum, 
the library (especially rich in theology), and, at some distance 
from the town, the astronomical and meteorological observatory 
on Mont Gros (1 220 ft.). The industrial establishments comprise 
perfumery factories, distilleries, oil-works, furniture and wood- 
work factories, confectionery works, soap-works, tanneries 
and a national tobacco factory employing several hundred 
persons. Besides the vine, the trees principally cultivated 
in the neighbourhood are the olive, the orange, the mulberry 
and the carob; and the staple exports are oil, agricultural 
produce, fruits and flowers. 

Nice now joins on the north-east the ancient episcopal town 
of Cimiez, in which are situated the largest and most elegantly 
appointed hotels. Reckoning from east to west the town is sur- 
rounded by a girdle of beautiful towns — Carabacel, St Etienne, 
St Philippe and Les Beaumettes. On the east of the port lie 
Montboron, Riquier and St Roch, the last partly occupied 
by barracks. The entrances to the port of Nice and the outer 
pier have been improved; that of the outer port is 300 ft. 
wide, and that of the inner 220 ft. The area of the port is about 
15 acres, the length of quayage available 3380 ft., the depth 
of water 20 ft., its trade, mostly coastal, being shared principally 
between French and Italian vessels, the arrivals being about 
1 235 vessels of some 300,000 tons annually. Nice is an episcopal 
see (first mentioned at the end of the 4th century) which since 
i860 is in the ecclesiastical province of Aix en Provence. It 
is the headquarters of a military division forming part of the 
corps d'armee of Marseilles. Protected towards the north by 
hills which rise stage behind stage to the main ridge of the Alps, 
Nice is celebrated for the mildness of its climate. The mean 
temperature is 6o° Fahr., that of winter being 49 , of spring 
56 , of summer 72 and of autumn 63 . For a few nights in 
winter the meicury sinks below freezing point, but snow is 
practically unknown, falling, on an average, only half a day in 
the year. The highest reading of the thermometer is rarely 
above 90 . There are sixty-seven days with rain in the course 
of the year; but it usually falls in heavy showers which soon 
leave the sky clear again, though the whole annual amount 
exceeds 32 in. Fine days and rainy days are almost equally 
distributed throughout the different seasons. The winds are 
very variable, sometimes changing several times a day. Apart 
from the ordinary land and sea breezes, the most frequent is 
the east wind, which is especially formidable during autumn. 
The south-west wind (called Libeccio, or wind of Lybia) is moist 
and warm; the north-east (or Gregaou, Greek), which is happily 
rare, brings storms of hail and even snow in winter. The mistral 
(from the north-west) and the tramontane (from the north) 
are generally stopped by the mountains; but when they do 
reach the city they raise intolerable dust-storms. For two 
thousand years the climate of Nice has been considered favour- 
able in chest complaints. Those who are requiring rest, and those 
suffering from gout, asthma, catarrhs, rachitic affections, 
scrofula, stone, also experience benefit; but the reverse is the 
case when heart disease, nervous disorders or ophthalmia are 
concerned. Autumn is the best season; in spring the sudden 
changes of temperature demand great care. Means of passing 
the time pleasantly are fairly abundant. The city is at its 
liveliest during -the carnival festivities, in which, as at Rome, 
battles are waged with sweetmeats and flowers. 

History. — Nice (Nicaea)was founded about two thousand years 
ago by the Phocaeans of Marseilles, and received its name in 
honour of a victory (viicq) over the neighbouring Ligurians. It 
soon became one of the busiest trading stations on the Ligurian 
coast; but as a city it had an important rival in the town of 
Cemenelum, which continued to exist till the time of the Lombard 
invasions, and has left its ruins at Cimiez, 2% m. to the north. 
In the 7th century Nice joined the Genoese league formed by the 
towns of Liguria. In 729 it repulsed the Saracens; but in 859 
and 880 they pillaged and burned it, and for the most of the 10th 
century remained masters of the surrounding country. During 
the middle ages Nice had its share in the wars and disasters of 
Italy. As an ally of Pisa it was the enemy of Genoa, and both 
the king of France and the emperor endeavoured to subjugate 
it; but in spite of all it maintained its municipal liberties. In the 
course of the 13th and 14th centuries it fell more than once into 
the hands of the counts of Provence; and at length in 1388 it 
placed itself under the protection of the counts of Savoy. The 
maritime strength of Nice now rapidly increased till it was able to 
cope with the Barbary pirates; the fortifications were largely 
extended and the roads to the city improved. During the struggle 
between Francis I. and Charles V. great damage was caused by 
the passage of the armies invading Provence; pestilence and 
famine raged in the city for several years. It was in Nice that 
the two monarchs in 1538 concluded, through the mediation of 
Paul III., a truce of ten years; and a marble cross set up to 
commemorate the arrival of the pope still gives its name, Croix de 
Marbre, to part of the town. In 1543 Nice was attacked by the 
united forces of Francis I. and Barbarossa; and, though the 
inhabitants, with admirable courage, repulsed the assault which 
succeeded the terrible bombardment, they were ultimately 
compelled to surrender, and Barbarossa was allowed to pillage 
the city and to carry off 2500 captives. Pestilence appeared 
again in 1550 and 1580. In 1600 Nice was taken by the duke of 
Guise. By opening the ports of the countship to all nations, and 
proclaiming full freedom of trade, Charles Emmanuel in r626 
gave a great stimulus to the commerce of the city, whose noble 
families took part in its mercantile enterprises. Captured by 
Catinat in i69r, Nice was restored to Savoy in 1696; but it was 
again besieged by the French in 1705, and in the following year 
its citadel and ramparts were demolished. The treaty of Utrecht 
in 1 7 13 once more gave the city back to Savoy; and in the 
peaceful years which followed the " new town " was built. 
From 1744 till the peace of Aix-la-Chapelle (r748) the French 
and Spaniards were again in possession. In 1775 the king of 
Sardinia destroyed all that remained of the ancient liberties of 
the commune. Conquered in 1792 by the armies of the French 
Republic, the county of Nice continued to be part of France till 
1814; but after that date it reverted to Sardinia. By a treaty 
concluded in i860 between the Sardinian king and Napoleon III. 
it was again transferred to France, and the cession was ratified 
by over 25,000 electors out of a total of 30,700.

NICE, an adjective which in present usage has two main 
meanings: (1) fastidious, particular, precise or scrupulous, and 
(2) pleasant, kind or agreeable. The first meaning has been 
common since the 16th century, the second only since the end 
of the 18th. In O. Fr., from which the English form was adapted, 
the word is niche or nice, which are derivatives of Lat. nescius, 
not knowing, ignorant. The development in meaning is doubt- 
ful; some authorities take it as (1) foolish, (2) foolishly precise, 
(3) delicate, (4) pleasant. Skeat suggests an early confusion 
with the word " nesh," soft, delicate, still surviving dialectically. 


NICEPHORUS, the name of three emperors of the East. 

Nicephorus I., emperor 8o2-8rr, was a native of Seleucia in 
Pisidia, who was raised by the empress Irene to the office of 
logothetes or lord high treasurer. With the help of the patricians 
and eunuchs he contrived to dethrone and exile Irene, and to be 
elected emperor in her stead. His sovereignty was endangered 
by Bardanes, one of his ablest generals, who revolted and received 
support from other commanders, notably the later emperors Leo 
the Armenian and Michael the Amorian. But Nicephorus gained 
over the latter two, and by inducing the rebel army to disperse 
achieved the submission of Bardanes, who was relegated to a 
monastery. A conspiracy headed by the patrician Arsaber had 
a similar issue. Nicephorus, who needed large sums to strengthen 
his military force, set himself with great energy to increase the 
empire's revenue. By his rigorous imposts he alienated the 
favour of his subjects, and especially of the. clergy, whom he 
otherwise sought to control firmly. In 803 and 8ro He made a 
treaty with Charlemagne, by which the limits of the two empires 
were amicably fixed. Venice, Istria, the Dalmatian coast and 
South Italy were assigned to the East, while Rome, Ravenna and 
the Pentapolis were included in the Western realm. By with- 
holding the tribute which Irene had agreed to pay to Harun 
al-Rashid, Nicephorus committed himself to a war with the' 
Saracens. Compelled by Bardanes's disloyalty to take the field 
himself, he sustained a severe defeat at Crasus in Phrygia (805), 
and the subsequent inroads of the enemy into Asia Minor induced 
him to make peace on condition of paying a yearly contribution 
of 30,000 gold pieces. By the death of Harun in 809, Nicephorus 
was left free to deal with the Bulgarian king, Krum, who was 
harassing his northern frontiers. In 8ri Nicephonis invaded 
Bulgaria and drove Krum to ask for terms, but in a night attack 
he allowed himself to be surprised and was slain along with a 
large portion of his army. Krum is said to have made a drinking- 
cup of Nicephorus's skull. 

Nicephorus II. (Phocas), emperor 963-969, belonged to a 
Cappadocian family which had produced several distinguished 
generals. He was born about 912, joined the army at an early 
age, and, under Constantine VII., became commander on the 
eastern frontier. In the war with the Saracens he began with a 
severe defeat (956), which he retrieved in the years following by 
victories in Syria. In 960 he led an expedition to Crete, stormed 
Candia after a ten months' siege, and wrested the whole island 
from the Saracens. After receiving the unusual honours of a 
triumph, he returned to the east with a large and well-equipped 
army. In the campaigns of 962-63 by brilliant strategy he forced 
his way through Cilicia into Syria and captured Aleppo, but 
made no permanent conquests. Upon the death of Romanus II. 
he returned to Constantinople to defend himself against the 
intrigues of the minister Bringas. With the help of the regent 
Theophano and the patriarch, he received supreme command 
of the eastern forces, and being proclaimed emperor by these 
marched upon the capital, where meanwhile his partisans had 
overthrown his enemy Bringas. Thanks to his popularity with 
the army, Nicephorus was crowned emperor by the side of 
Romanus's infant sons, and in spite of the patriarch's opposition 
married their mother Theophano. During his reign he continued 
to wage numerous wars. In 964-966 he definitely conquered 
Cilicia and again overran Mesopotamia and Syria, while the 
patrician Nicetas recovered Cyprus. In 968 he reduced most of 
the fortresses in Syria, and after the fall of Antioch and Aleppo 
(969), which were recaptured by his lieutenants, secured his 
conquests by a peace. On his northern frentier he began a war 
against the Bulgarians, to whom the Byzantines had of late been 
paying tribute (967), and by instigating an attack from the 
Russians distracted their attention effectively. Nicephorus was 
less successful in his western wars. After renouncing his tribute 
to the Fatimite caliphs, he sent an expedition to Sicily under 
Nicetas (964-65), but was forced by defeats on land and sea to 
evacuate that island completely. In 967 he made peace with the 
Saracens of Kairawan and turned to defend himself against their 
common enemy, Otto I. of Germany, who had attacked the 
Byzantine possessions in Italy; but after some initial successes 
his generals were defeated and driven back upon the southern 
coast. Owing to the care which he lavished upon the proper 
maintenance of the army, Nicephorus was compelled to exercise 
rigid economy in other departments. He retrenched the court 
largesses and curtailed the immunities of the clergy, and although 
himself of an ascetic disposition forbade the foundation of new 
monasteries. By his heavy imposts and the debasement of the 
coinage he forfeited his popularity with the rest of the community, 
and gave rise to riots. Last of all, he was forsaken by his wife, 
and, in consequence of a conspiracy which she headed with his 
nephew John Zimisces, was assassinated in his sleeping apart- 
ment. Nicephorus was the author of an extant treatise on 
military tactics which contains valuable information concerning 
the art of war in his time. 

Nicephorus III. (Botaniates), emperor 1078-1081, belonged 
to a family which claimed descent from the Roman Fabh" and 
rose to be commander of the troops in Asia. He revolted in 1078 
from Michael VII., and with the connivance of the Turks marched 
upon Nicaea, where he assumed the purple. In face of another 
rebellious general, Nicephorus Bryennius, his election was ratified 
by the aristocracy and clergy. With the help of Alexius Com- 
nenus he drove out of the field Bryennius and other rivals, but 
failed to clear the invading Turks out of Asia Minor. Nicephorus 
ultimately quarrelled with Alexius, who used his influence with 
the army to depose the emperor and banish him to a monastery. 
In the years of his reign he had entirely given himself over to 
debauchery.

NICEPHORUS CALLISTUS XANTHOPOULOS, of Constan- 
tinople, the last of the Greek ecclesiastical historians, flourished 
1320-1330. His Historia Ecclesiastica, in eighteen books, 
brings the narrative down to 610; for the first four centuries 
the author is largely dependent on his predecessors, Eusebius, 
Socrates, Sozomen, Theodoret and Evagrius, his additions 
showing very little critical faculty; for the later period his 
laoours, based on documents now no longer extant, to which he 
had free access, though he used them also with small discrimina- 
tion, are much more valuable. A table of contents of other 
five books, continuing the history to the death of Leo the 
Philosopher in 911, also exists, but whether the books were ever 
actually written is doubtful. Some modern scholars are of 
opinion that Nicephorus appropriated and passed off as his own 
the work of an unknown author of the 10th century. The plan 
of the work is good and, in spite of its fables and superstitious 
absurdities, contains important facts which would otherwise 
have been unknown. The history of the Latin Church receives 
little attention. Only one MS. of the history is known; it was 
stolen by a Turkish soldier from the library at Buda during the 
reign of Matthias Corvinus of Hungary and taken to Constan- 
tinople, where it was bought by a Christian and eventually reached 
the imperial library at Vienna. Nicephorus was also the author 
of lists of the emperors and patriarchs of Constantinople, of a 
poem on the capture of Jerusalem, and of a synopsis of the 
Scriptures, all in iambics; and of commentaries on liturgical 
poems.

NICEPHORUS PATRIARCHA (c. 758-829), Byzantine 
historian and patriarch of Constantinople (806-815). His father 
Theodorus, one of the secretaries of the emperor Constantine 
Copronymus, had been scourged and banished for his zealous 
support of image-worship, and the son inherited the religious 
convictions of the father. He was secretary to the imperial 
commissaries at the council of Nicaea in 787, which witnessed 
the triumph of his opinions; but, feeling dissatisfied with court 
life, he retired into a convent. In 806 he was suddenly raised 
by the emperor Nicephorus I. to the patriarchate of Constan- 
tinople, and this office he held until 815, when he accepted deposi- 
tion rather than assent to the iconoclastic edict promulgated hy 
Leo the Armenian in the previous year. He retired to the 
cloister of StT/Theodore, which he himself had founded, and 
died there in 829. After his death he was included among the 
saints of the orthodox church. 

Nicephorus is the author of a valuable compendium (Breviarium 
historicum) of Byzantine history from 602 to 770, of a meagre 
Chronologia compendiaria from Adam to the year of his own death. 
The former contains an interesting account of the origin and migra- 
tions of the Bulgarians. Both will be found, together with some 
controversial writings and his biography by his pupil Ignatius, 
also patriarch of Constantinople, in J. P. Migne, Patrologia Graeca,

Teubner series); see also F. Hirsch, Byzanttnische Studien (1876);

NICHE (through Fr. niche from Ital. nicchia, nicchio, shell; 
possibly from Lat. mittdus, a sea-mussel; cf. " napkin " from 
mappa), in architecture a recess sunk in a wall, generally for the 
reception of a statue. The niche is sometimes terminated by 
a simple label, but more commonly by a canopy, and with a 
bracket or corbel for the figure, in which case it is often called 
a " tabernacle. " 


NICHOL, JOHN (1833-1894), Scottish man of letters, son of 
the astronomer J. P. Nichol (1804-1859), was born on the 8th 
of September 1833, and educated at Glasgow and Balliol College, 
Oxford, where he had a brilliant career. After taking his first- 
class in classics, he remained at Oxford as a coach. With Albert 
Venn Dicey, Thomas Hill Green, Swinburne and others, he formed 
the Old Mortality Society for discussions on literary matters. 
In 1862 he was made professor of English literature at Glasgow. 
He had already made a reputation as an acute critic and a suc- 
cessful lecturer, and his influence at Glasgow was very marked. 
He visited the United States in 1865, and in 1882 he wrote 
the article on American literature for the ninth edition of the 
Encyclopedia Britannica — an article which is a good example 
of his pungent (sometimes unduly pungent) style. He left 
Glasgow for London in 1889, and died on the nth of October 
1894. Among his best works were his drama Hannibal (1873), 
The Death of Themistocles, and other Poems (i88r), his Byron 
in the " English Men of Letters " series (1880), his Robert Burns 
(1882) and Carlyle (1892). 

A Memoir by Professor Knight was published in 1896. 


NICHOLAS, ST, bishop of Myra, in Lycia, a saint honoured 
by the Greeks and the Latins on the 6th of December. His 
cult is as celebrated as his history is obscure. All the accounts 
that have come down to us are of a purely legendary character, 
and it is impossible to find any single incident confirmed historic- 
ally. The main facts of his life are usually given as follows. 
He was bishop of Myra in the time of the emperor Diocletian, 
was persecuted, tortured for the faith, and kept in prison until 
the more tolerant reign of Constantine, and was present at the 
council of Nicaea. It should be observed that this last circum- 
stance is ignored by all the historians, and that St Athanasius, 
who knew all the notable bishops of the period, never mentions 
Nicholas, bishop of Myra. The oldest known monument of the 
cult of St Nicholas seems to be the church of SS Priscus and 
Nicholas built at Constantinople by the emperor Justinian (see 
Procopius, De aedif. i. 6). In the West, the name of St 
Nicholas appears in the 9th century martyrologies, and churches 
dedicated to him are to be found at the beginning of the nth 
century. It is more especially, however, from the time of the 
removal of his body to Bari, in Apulia, that his cult became 
popular. The inhabitants of Bari organized an expedition, 
seized his remains by means of a ruse, and transported them to 
Bari, where they were received in triumph on the 9th of May 
1087, and where the foundations were laid of a new basilica fn 
his honour. This was the origin of a famous and still popular 
pilgrimage. There are nearly 400 churches in England dedicated 
to St Nicholas. He is the patron saint of Russia; the special 
protector of children, scholars, merchants and sailors; and is 
invoked by travellers against robbers. In art St Nicholas is 
represented with various attributes, being most commonly 
depicted with three children standing in a tub by his side. Of 
the various interpretations of this, none is absolutely certain. 
One explanation has been sought in the legend of St Nicholas 
miraculously restoring to life three rich youths, who had been 
murdered, cut up and concealed in a salting tub by a thievish 
innkeeper or butcher, in whose house they had taken lodging. 

A legend of his surreptitious bestowal of dowries upon the 
three daughters of an impoverished citizen, who, unable to 
procure fit marriages for them, was on the point of giving them 
up to a life of shame, is said to have originated the old custom of 
giving presents in secret on the Eve of St Nicholas, subsequently 
transferred to Christmas Day. Hence the association of Christmas 
with " Santa Claus," an American corruption of the Dutch 
form " San Nicolaas," the custom being brought to America 
by the early Dutch colonists. (For the ceremony of the boy- 
bishop elected on St Nicholas's Day see Boy-Bishop.) _ w

NICHOLAS, the name of five popes, and one anti-pope. 

Nicholas I., sometimes called The Great, and certainly the 
most commanding figure in the series of popes between Gregory 
I. and Gregory VH., succeeded Benedict III. in April 858. 
According to the annalist Prudentius of Troyes, " he owed his 
election less to the choice of the clergy than to the presence and 
favour of the emperor Louis II. and his nobles" — who can 
hardly have foreseen with what ability and persistency the rights 
of the Holy See as supreme arbiter of Christendom were to be 
asserted even against themselves by the man of their choice. 
Of the previous history of Nicholas nothing is recorded. His 
pontificate of nine years and a half was marked by at least 
three memorable contests which have left their mark in history. 
The first was that in which he supported the claims of the 
unjustly degraded patriarch of Constantinople, Ignatius; the 
history of the conflict cannot be related here, but two of its 
incidents, the excommunication of Photius, the rival of Ignatius, 
by the pope in 86$, and the counter-deposition of Nicholas 
by Photius in 867, were steps of serious moment towards the 
permanent separation between the Eastern and the Western 
Church. The second great struggle was that with Lothair, 
the king of Lorraine (second son of the emperor Lothair L, 
and brother of the emperor Louis II.), about the divorce of his 
wife Theutberga or Thietberga. The king, who desired to marry 
his mistress Waldrada, had brought a grave charge against the 
life of his queen before her marriage; with the help of Arch- 
bishops Gunther of Cologne and Thietgaud of Treves, a confession 
of guilt had been extorted from Thietberga, and, after the matter 
had been discussed at more than one synod, that of Aix-la- 
ChapeLLe finally authorized Lothair, on the strength of this 
confession, to marry again. Nicholas ordered a fresh synod 
to try the cause over again at Metz in 863; but Lothair, who 
was present with his nobles, anew secured a judgment favourable 
to himself, whereupon the pope not only quashed the whole 
proceedings, but excommunicated and deposed Gunther and 
Thietgaud, who had been audacious enough to bring to Rome 
in person the " libellus " of the synod. The archbishops appealed 
to Louis II., then at Benevento, to obtain the withdrawal of 
their sentence by force; but, although he actually occupied 
the Leonine city (864), he was unsuccessful in obtaining any 
concession, and had to withdraw to Ravenna. Thietberga 
herself was now induced to write to the pope a letter in which she 
declared the invalidity of her own marriage, and urged the cause 
of Lothair, but Nicholas, not without reason, refused to accept 
statements which had too plainly been extorted, and wrote 
urging her to maintain the truth steadfastly, even to the death 
if need were, " for, since Christ is the truth, whosoever dies 
for the truth assuredly dies for Christ." The imminent humilia- 
tion of Lothair was prevented only by the death of Nicholas. 
The third great ecclesiastical cause which marks this pontificate 
was that in which the indefeasible right of bishops to appeal 
to Rome against their metropolitans was successfully maintained 
in the case of Rothad of Soissons, who had been deposed by 
Hincmar of Reims. It was in the course of the controversy 
with the great and powerful Neustrian archbishop that papal 
recognition was first given (in 865) to the False Decretals, 
which had probably been brought by Rothad to Rome in the 
preceding year (see Decretals). At an early period in his reign 
it also became necessary for Nicholas to administer discipline 
to John of Ravenna, who seems to have relied not only on the 
prestige of his famous see but also on the support of Louis II. 
After lying under excommunication for some time he made a 
full submission. Nicholas was the pope to whom Boris, the 
newly converted king of Bulgaria, addressed himself for practical 
instruction in some of the difficult moral and social problems 
which naturally arise during a transition from heathenism to 
Christianity. The pope's letter in reply to the hundred and 
six questions and petitions of the barbarian king is perhaps the 
most interesting literary relic of Nicholas I. now extant. He 
died on the 13th of November 867, and was succeeded by 
Adrian II.

Nicholas II. , pope from December 1058 to July 1061, was a 
Burgundian named Gerard, who at the time of his election was 
bishop of Florence. He was set up by Hildebrand, with the 
support of the empress-regent Agnes and of the powerful Duke 
Godfrey of Lorraine, against Benedict X., the nominee of the 
Roman nobles, and was crowned at Rome, after the expulsion 
of Benedict, on the 24th of January 1059. His pontificate was 
signalized by the continuance of the policy of ecclesiastical 
reform associated with the name of Hildebrand (afterwards 
Gregory VII.). To secure his position he at once entered into 
relation with the Normans, now firmly established in southern 
Italy, and later in the year the new alliance was cemented at 
MeLfi, where Nicholas II., accompanied by Hildebrand, Cardinal 
Humbert and the abbot Desiderius of Monte Cassino, solemnly 
invested Robert Guiscard with the duchies of Apulia, Calabria 
and Sicily, and Richard of Aversa with the principality of Capua, 
in return for oaths of fealty and the promise of assistance in 
guarding the rights of the Church. The first fruits of this 
arrangement, which was based on no firmer foundation than the 
forged " Donation of Constantine " (q.v.), but destined to srive 
to the papacy a position of independence towards both the 
Eastern and Western Empires, was the reduction in the autumn, 
with Norman aid, of Gal era, where the anti-pope had taken 
refuge, and the end of the subordination of the papacy to the 
Roman nobles. 

Meanwhile, Peter Damian and Bishop Anselm of Lucca had 
been sent by Pope Nicholas to Milan to adjust the difference 
between the Patarenes and the archbishop and clergy. The 
result was a fresh triumph for the papacy, Archbishop Wido, 
in face of the ruinous conflict in the Church of Milan, being 
forced to submit to the terms proposed by the legates, which 
involved the principle of the subordination of Milan to Rome; 
the new relation was advertized by the unwilling attendance of 
Wido and the other Milanese bishops at the council summoned 
to the Lateran palace in April 1059. This council not only 
continued the Hildebrandine reforms by sharpening the discipline 
of the clergy, but marks an epoch in the history of the papacy 
by its famous regulation of future elections to the Holy See (see 
Lateran Councils, and Conclave). Its most important 
immediate result was the revival of strained relations with the 
empire, due to the fact that the emperor's traditional rights in 
the matter of papal elections had been completely ignored. 
Stephen, cardinal priest of S. Chrysogonus, was sent to the 
German court to attempt to allay the consequent ill-feeling, but 
was not received. Pope Nicholas, moreover, had offended the 
German bishops by what they regarded as arbitrary interference 
with their rights: he had refused to send the pallium of Arch- 
bishop Siegfried of Mainz; he had sent a sharp letter of 
admonition to Archbishop Anno of Cologne. The resulting 
opposition culminated in a synod of German bishops, perhaps 
early in 1061 (its date and place of meeting are unknown), at 
which the decrees of the pope, including the new electoral law, 
were annulled, while he himself was deposed and his name 
ordered to be expunged from the canon of the Mass. That these 
resolutions were not followed by any further action was due to 
the war of parties in Germany, which enabled the papacy to 
ignore a demonstration of opinion to which no effect could be 
given. 

Nicholas II. died at Florence in July 1061. Personally he 
was one of the least important of the popes, and the great 
importance of the events of his pontificate is due to the fact 
that, as Peter Damian wrote (Epist. i. 7), he possessed in Hilde- 
brand, Cardinal Humbert and Bishop Boniface of Albano 
acuiissimi et perspicacis oculi.

" Nicolas II." (X.) 

Nicholas III. (Giovanni Gaetano Orsini), pope from the 
25th of November 1277 to the 22nd of August 1280, was a 
Roman nobleman who had served under eight popes, been made 
cardinal-deacon of St Nicola in carcere Tulliano by Innocent IV., 
protector of the Franciscans by Alexander IV., inquisitor-general 
by Urban IV., and succeeded John XXI., largely through family 
influence, after a six-months' vacancy in the Holy See. His 
brief pontificate was marked by several important events. A 
born politician, he greatly strengthened the papal position in 
Italy. He concluded a concordat with Rudolph of Habsburg in 
May 1278, by which the Romagna and the exarchate of Ravenna 
were guaranteed to the pope; and in July he issued an epoch- 
making constitution for the government of Rome, which forbade 
foreigners taking civil office. Nicholas issued the bull Exiit 
on the 14th of August 1279 to settle the strife within the 
Franciscan order between the parties of strict and loose observ- 
ance. He repaired the Lateran and the Vatican at' enormous 
cost, and erected a beautiful country house at Soriano near 
Viterbo. Nicholas, though a man of learning and strength of 
character, brought just reproach on himself for his efforts to 
found principalities for his nephews and other relations. He 
died from a stroke of apoplexy and was succeeded by Martin IV.

Nicholas IV. (Girolamo Masci), pope from the' 22nd of 
February 1288 to the 4th of April 1292, a native of Ascoli and a 
Franciscan monk, had been legate to the Greeks under Gregory X. 
in 1272, succeeded St Bonaventura as general of his order in 
1274, was made cardinal-priest of Sta Prassede and Latin 
patriarch of Constantinople by Nicholas III., cardinal-bishop of 
Palestrina by Martin IV., and succeeded Honorius IV. after a 
ten-months' vacancy in the papacy. He was a pious, peace- 
loving monk with no ambition save for the church, the crusades 
and the extirpation of heresy. He steered a middle course 
between the factions at Rome, and sought a settlement of the 
Sicilian question. In May 1289 he crowned Charles II. king of 
Naples and Sicily after the latter had expressly recognized papal 
suzerainty, and in February 1291 concluded a treaty with 
Alphonso III. of Aragon and Philip IV. of France looking toward 
the expulsion of James of Aragon from Sicily. The loss of 
Ptolemais in 1291 stirred the pope to renewed enthusiasm for 
a crusade. He sent the celebrated Franciscan missionary, John 
of Monte Corvino, with some companions to labour among the 
Tatars and Chinese. He issued an important constitution on 
the 18th of July 1289, which granted to the cardinals one-half 
of all income accruing to the Roman see and a share in the 
financial management, and thereby paved the way for that 
independence of the college of cardinals which, in the foDowing 
century, was to be of detriment to the papacy. Nicholas died in 
the palace which he had built beside Sta Maria Maggiore, and 
was succeeded by Celestine V.

Nicholas V. (Tomaso Parentucelli or Tomaso da Sarzana), 
pope from the 6th of March 1447 to the 24th of March 1455, 
was born at Sarzana, where his father was a physician, in 
1398. He early studied at Bologna, where the bishop, Nicholas 
Albergati, was so much struck with his ardour for learning that 
he gave him the chance to pursue his studies further, by sending 
him on a tour through Germany, France and England. He 
distinguished himself at the council of Ferrara- Florence, and in 
1444 was made bishop of Bologna by Pope Eugenius IV., who 
soon afterwards named him as one of the legates charged to 
negotiate at the convention of Frankfort an understanding 
between the Holy See and the Empire with regard to the re- 
forming decrees of the council of Basel. His successful diplomacy 
was rewarded, on his return to Rome, with the title of cardinal 
priest of Sta Susanna (December 1446). He was elected pope in 
succession to Eugenius IV. on the 6th of March of the following 
year, taking the name of Nicholas in honour of his early bene- 
factor- 

The eight years of his pontificate were important in the' 
political, scientific and literary history of the world. With the 
German king, Frederick III., he made the Concordat of Vienna, 
or Aschaffenburg (February 17, 1448), by which the decrees 
of the council of Basel against papal annates and reservations 
were abrogated so far as Germany was concerned; and in the 
following year he secured a still greater triumph when the 
resignation of the anti-pope Felix V. (April 7), and his own 
recognition by the rump of the council of Basel, assembled at 
Lausanne, put an end to the papal schism. The next year, 
1450, Nicholas held a jubilee at Rome; and the offerings of the 
numerous pilgrims who thronged to Rome gave him the means 
of furthering the cause of culture in Italy, which he had so 
much at heart. In March 1452 he crowned Frederick III. as 
emperor in St Peter's, the last occasion of the coronation of an 
emperor at Rome. 

Under the generous patronage of Nicholas humanism made 
rapid strides. He employed .hundreds of copyists and scholars, 
giving as much as ten thousand gulden for a metrical translation 
of Homer, and founded a library of nine thousand volumes. 
Nicholas himself was a man of vast erudition, and his friend 
Aeneas Silvius (later Pope Pius II.) said of him that " what 
he does not know is outside the range of human knowledge." 
He was compelled, however, to add that the lustre of his 
pontificate would be for ever dulled by the tragic fall of Con- 
stantinople, which the Turks took in 1453. The pope bitterly 
felt this catastrophe as a double blow to Christendom and to 
Greek letters. " It is a second death," wrote Aeneas Silvius, 
"to Homer and Plato." Nicholas preached a crusade, and en- 
deavoured to reconcile the mutual animosities of the Italian 
states, but without much success. 

Nicholas conceived great plans for beautifying and developing 
Rome. He restored the walls and numerous churches, and 
began the rebuilding of the Vatican and St Peter's. In under- 
taking these works Nicholas was moved by no vulgar motives, 
his idea being " to strengthen the weak faith of the people by 
the greatness of that which it sees." The Romans, however, 
appreciated neither his motives nor their results, and in 1452 
a formidable conspiracy for the overthrow of the papal govern- 
ment, under the leadership of Stefano Porcaro, was discovered 
and crushed. This revelation of disaffection, together with the 
fall of Constantinople, darkened the last years of Nicholas; 
" As Thomas of Sarzana," he said, " I had more happiness in a 
day than now in a whole year." He died on the 24th of March 
1455-

Nicholas V. (Pietro Rainalducci), antipope in Italy from 
1328 to 1330 during the pontificate of John XXII. at Avignon, 
was a native of Corbara in the Abruzzi. He joined the Franciscan 
order after separating from his wife in 13 10, and became famous 
as a preacher. He was elected through the influence of the 
excommunicated emperor, Louis the Bavarian, by an assembly 
of priests and laymen, and consecrated at St Peter's on the 
12th of May 1328 by the bishop of Venice. After spending 
four months in Rome, he withdrew with Louis to Viterbo and 
thence to Pisa, where be was guarded by the imperial vicar. 
He was excommunicated by John XXII. in April 1329, and 
sought refuge with Count Boniface of Donoratico near Piombino. 
Having obtained assurance of pardon, he presented a confession 
of his sins first to the archbishop of Pisa, and then (25th of 
August 1330) to the pope at Avignon. He remained in honour- 
able imprisonment in the papal palace until his death in October 
1333- . •

NICHOLAS (1841- ), King of Montenegro and the Berda, 
was born at the village of Niegush, the ancient home of the 
reigning family of Petrovitch-Niegush, on the 25th of September 
1841. His father, Mirko Petrovitch, a celebrated Montenegrin 
warrior, was elder brother to Danilo II., who left no male off- 
spring. After 1696, when the dignity of vladika, or prince- 
bishop, became hereditary in the Petrovitch family, the sovereign 
power had descended from uncle to nephew, the vladikas belong- 
ing to the order of the " black clergy " who are forbidden to 
marry. A change. was introduced by Danilo II., who declined the 
episcopal office, married and declared the principality hereditary 
in the direct male line. Mirko Petrovitch having resigned his 
claim to the throne, his son was nominated heir, and the old 
system of succession was thus accidentally continued. Prince 
Nicholas, who had been trained from infancy in martial and 
athletic exercises, spent a portion of his early boyhood at Trieste 
in the household of the Kuetitch family, to which his aunt, the 
princess Darinka, wife of Danilo II., belonged. The princess was 
an ardent advocate of French culture, and at her suggestion the 
young heir of the vladikas was sent to the academy of Louis 
le Grand in Paris. Unlike his contemporary, King Milan of 
Servia, Prince Nicholas was little influenced in his tastes and 
habits by his Parisian education; the young mountaineer, 
whose keen patriotism, capability for leadership and poetic 
talents early displayed themselves, showed no inclination for 
the pleasures of the French capital, and eagerly looked forward 
to returning to his native land. He was still in Paris when, 
in consequence of the assassination of his uncle, he succeeded 
as prince (August 13, i860). In 1862 Montenegro was engaged 
in an unfortunate struggle with Turkey; the prince distin- 
guished himself during the campaign, and on one occasion 
narrowly escaped with his life. In the period of peace which 
followed he carried out a series of military, administrative and 
educational reforms. In 1867 he met the emperor Napoleon III. 
at Paris, and in 1868 he undertook a journey to Russia, where 
he received an affectionate welcome from the tsar, Alexander II. 
He afterwards visited the courts of Berlin and Vienna, His 
efforts to enlist the sympathies of the Russian imperial family 
were productive of important results for Montenegro; consider- 
able subventions were granted by the tsar and tsaritsa for 
educational and other purposes, and supplies of arms and 
ammunition were sent to Cettigne. In 187 1 Prince Dolgorouki 
arrived at Montenegro o*n a special mission from the tsar, and 
distributed large sums of money among the people. In 1869 
Prince Nicholas, whose authority was now firmly established, 
succeeded in preventing the impetuous mountaineers from 
aiding the Krivoshians in their revolt against the Austrian 
government (see Cattaro); similarly in 1897 he checked the 
martial excitement caused by the outbreak of the Greco-Turkish 
War. In 1876 he declared war against Turkey; his military 
reputation was enhanced by the ensuing campaign, and still 
more by that of 1877-78, during which he captured Nikshitch, 
Antivari and Dulcigno. The war resulted in a considerable 
extension of the Montenegrin frontier and the acquisition of 
a seaboard on the Adriatic. In 1883 Prince Nicholas visited 
the sultan, with whom he subsequently maintained the most 
cordial relations; in 1896 he celebrated the bicentenary of the 
Petrovitch dynasty, and in the same year he attended the 
coronation of the tsar Nicholas II.; in May 1898 he visited Queen 
Victoria at Windsor. In 1900 he assumed the title of " Royal 
Highness." On the 28th of August 1910, during the celebration 
of his jubilee, he assumed the title of king, in accordance with 
a petition from the Skupshtina. He was at the same time 
gazetted field-marshal in the Russian army, an honour never 
previously conferred on any foreigner except the great duke of 
Wellington. The descendant of a long line of warriors, gifted 
with a fine physique and a commanding presence, a successful 
military leader and a graceful poet, King Nicholas possessed 
many characteristics which awoke the enthusiasm of the im- 
pressionable Servian race, while his merits as a statesman 
received general recognition. His system of government, which 
may be described as a benevolent despotism, was perhaps that 
best suited to the character of his subjects. His historical 
dramas, poems and ballads hold a recognized place in contem- 
porary Slavonic literature; among them are — Balkanska Tzaritza 
and Kniaz Arvaniti (dramas); Hatdana, Potini Abenserage and 
Pesnik i Vila (poems); Skupliene Pesme and Nova Kola (mis- 
cellaneous songs). In November i860 Prince Nicholas married 
Milena, daughter of the voievode Petar Vukotitch. Of his three 
sons, the eldest, Prince Danilo, married (July 27, 1899) Duchess 
Jutta (Militza) of Mecklenburg-Strelitz; of his six daughters, 
Princess Militza married the Grand Duke Peter Nikolaievitch, 
Princess Stana, Duke George of Leuchtenberg, Princess Helena, 
King Victor Emmanuel III. of Italy, and Princess Anka, Prince 
Francis Joseph of Battenberg. (J. D. B.) 


NICHOLAS I. [Nikolai Pavlovich], emperor of Russia (1796- 
l %$$)> eighth child of the emperor Paul I. and his wife Maria 
Feodorovna, was born at Tsarskoe-Selo on the 25th of June 
(July 6, N.S.) 1796. He was only five years old when his 
father's murder brought his brother Alexander I. to the throne 
(1801). In the following year his education was entrusted to 
M. von Lambsdorff, director of the 1st cadet corps and ex- 
governor of Courland, a man of character and wide knowledge, 
who superintended it for the next fifteen years. But Nicholas 
had as little taste for learning as his brother Constantine. The 
royal pupils spent their lesson hours, as Nicholas afterwards 
confessed, " partly in dreaming, partly in drawing all sorts of 
nonsense," in the end " cramming " just enough to scrape 
through their examinations without discredit. Their chief bent 
was in the direction of everything connected with military 
matters. Religious training was confined to instruction in the 
forms of the Orthodox Church and the repetition of prayers by 
rote; dogmatic questions Nicholas neither understood nor 
cared about; and, in spite of his reverence for his brother 
Alexander, the latter's mysticism had not the faintest influence 
upon him. 

Though a colonel in his cradle and a general since 1808, the 
grand-duke Nicholas did not see any active service until 1814, 
when he was allowed to join the Russian head-quarters in France 
but not to take part in any fighting. It is characteristic of him 
that from this time onwards he never wore civilian dress. In 
181 5 he was with the Allies in Paris, and in the following year 
set out on the grand tour, visiting Moscow and the western 
provinces of Russia, Berlin (where his engagement to Princess 
Charlotte Louise, daughter of Frederick William III., was 
arranged) and England, where his handsome presence and 
charming address created a profound impression. 1 On the 
i/i3th of July 1817 took place at St Petersburg his marriage to 
Princess Charlotte (Alexandra Feodorovna), the beginning of 
those intimate relations between the courts of Berlin and St 
Petersburg which were later to become of great international 
importance. On the 17/29^ of April 181 8 their first child, the 
future emperor Alexander II., was born. In the autumn Nicholas 
was placed in command of the 2nd brigade of the 1st division of 
the Guard. In 1819 the emperor Alexander first mentioned his 
intention to abdicate in favour of Nicholas, Constantine consent- 
ing to stand aside; but he took no steps to initiate his prospective 
heir in affairs of state, and the grand-duke continued to be 
confined to his military duties. In 1820 a further important 
step in the matter of the succession was taken in the divorce of 
Constantine from the grand-duchess Anne and his re-marriage 
to Johanna Grudzinska (see Constantine Pavlovich). In 
January 1822 it was decided in a family council, with the know- 
ledge though not in the presence of Nicholas, that Constantine's 
petition to be relieved of the burden of the crown, for which he 
felt himself unfitted, should be granted. It was not, however, 
until August 1823 that the emperor drew up the necessary papers, 
in the presence of the metropolitan Philaret and other witnesses, 
and deposited them in sealed packets, to be opened at his death, 
with the council of state, the senate and the holy synod. For 
some reason, which can only be conjectured, Constantine was 
not made a party to this proceeding. 

Alexander I. died at Taganrog on the 1st of December 1825. 
When, some days later, the news reached St Petersburg, all 
was confusion and uncertainty. Constantine was at Warsaw; 
Nicholas, who on the 3rd of May of the same year had become 
chief of the 2nd division of the infantry of the Guard, was too 
conscious of his unpopularity in the army — the fruit of his 
(Irastic discipline — to dare to assume the crown without a public 
abdication on the part of the legitimate heir. No steps were 
taken to open the sealed packets, and he himself took the oath 
to Constantine, and, with characteristic contempt for constitu- 
tional forms, usurped the functions of the senate and council of 
state by himself ordering its imposition on the regiments stationed 
in St Petersburg. But Constantine refused to come to St Peters- 
burg, or to do more than himself take the oath to Nicholas as 
emperor, and write assuring him of his loyalty. The result was 
a three weeks' interregnum, of which the discontented spirits 
in the army took advantage to bring to a head a plot that had 
long been hatching in favour of constitutional reform. When 
on the 14th of December the troops who had already taken the 
oath to Constantine were ordered to take another to Nicholas, 
it was easy to persuade them that this was a treasonable plot 
against the true emperor. The Moscow regiment refused to take 
the oath, and part of it marched, shouting for Constantine and 
"Constitution," 2 to the square before the Senate House, where 
they were joined by a company of the Guard and the sailors 
from the warships. In this crisis Nicholas showed high personal

courage, if little decision and initiative. It was entirely uncertain 
how many, and which, regiments could be trusted. For hours 
he stood, or sat on horseback, amid the surging crowd, facing 
the mutinous soldiers — who had loaded their muskets and 
formed square — while effort after effort was made to bring them 
to reason, sometimes at the cost of life — as in the case of Count 
Miloradovich, military governor of St Petersburg, who was 
mortally wounded by a pistol shot while arguing with the 
mutineers. Nicholas was saved by the very belief of the con- 
spirators hi the universal sympathy of the army with their aims. 
Had the mutinous troops early in the day received the order to 
attack, they would have carried the waverers with them; but 
they hesitated to fire on comrades whom they expected to see 
march over to their side; and when at last the emperor had 
steeled his heart to use force, a few rounds of grape-shot sufficed 
to quell the mutiny. The chief conspirators — Prince Shchepin- 
Rostovski, Suthoff, Ryleyev, Prince Sergius Trubetskoi, Prince 
Obolenski and others — were arrested the same night and inter- 
rogated by the emperor in person. A special commission, con- 
sisting entirely of officers, was then set up; and before this, for 
five months, the prisoners were subjected to a rigorous inquisition.* 
It was soon clear that the Decabrist 4 rising was but one manifesta- 
tion of a vast conspiracy permeating the whole army. A military 
rising on a large scale in the south was only averted by the news 
of the failure of the mutiny at St Petersburg; and at Moscow 
there were many arrests, including that of Colonel Paul Pest el, 
the chief of the revolutionary southern league. The prisoners 
were finally brought to trial before a supreme criminal court 
established by imperial ukaz on the 1st of June 1826; there were 
121 of them and their trial had concluded by the 12th of June. 
Some were condemned to death, others to solitary confinement 
in fortresses, others to the Siberian mines and colonies. Of the 
latter many were accompanied by their wives, though the Russian 
law allows divorce in the case of such sentences; the emperor 
unwillingly allowed the devoted women to go, but decreed that 
any children born to them in Siberia would be illegitimate. 

Firmly seated on his throne, Nicholas proceeded to fill up the 
gaps in his education by studying the condition of his empire. 
In spite of his reverence for his brother's memory, he made a 
clean sweep of " the angel's " Bible Society, 6 and other para- 
phernalia of official hypocrisy; as for Alexander's projects of 
reform, the pitiful legacy of a life of unfulfilled purposes, these 
were reported upon by committees, considered and shelved. 
Nicholas too saw the need for reform; the Decabrist conspiracy 
had burnt that into his soul; but he had his own views as to the 
reform needed. The state was corrupt, disorganized; what was 
wanted was not more liberty but more discipline. So he put 
civil servants, professors and students into uniform, and for 
little offences had them marched to the guard-house; thought 
was disciplined by the censorship, the army by an unceasing 
round of parades and inspections. The one great gift of 
Nicholas I. to Russia, a gift which he really believed would be 
welcome because it would bring every subject into immediate 
contact with the throne, was — the secret police, the dreaded 
Third Section. 6 

The crowning fault of Nicholas was, however, that he would 
not delegate his authority; whom could he trust but himself? 
In this he resembled his contemporary the emperor Francis L 
But Francis would " sleep upon" a difficult problem; Nicholas 
never slept. His constitution was of iron, his capacity for work 
prodigious; reviews and parades, receptions of deputations, 
visits to public institutions, then eight or nine hours in his

cabinet reading and deciding on reports and despatches — such 
was his ordinary day's work. Yet, in spite of all this, his activity 
could not but prove the narrow limits of autocratic power. 
Under the " Iron Tsar " the outward semblance of authority 
was perfectly maintained; but behind this imposing facade 
the whole structure of the Russian administrative system con- 
tinued to rot and crumble. The process was even hastened; 
for the emperor's stern discipline crushed out all independence 
of initiative and silenced all honest criticism. The secret police 
provided but a poor substitute for the assistance which an 
argus-eyed and articulate public opinion gives to the efficient 
working of a constitutional system; for the greatest of autocrats 
has but two eyes, and it is no difficult task to deceive him. 
Thus it came about that, as Professor Schiemann puts it, 
" Potemkin's scenery was brought out again," and Nicholas 
walked with conscious self-approval through a Russia seemingly 
well ordered, but in fact merely temporarily prepared for each 
stage of his progress. 

War is the ultimate and sharpest test of the soundness of a 
state, and to this test Russia was submitted soon after the 
accession of Nicholas, who could not be blind to the revelations 
that resulted, though he drew the wrong moral. These re- 
velations had, indeed, begun before the outbreak of the war 
with Turkey in 1828. The new tsar had devoted especial 
attention to the reform and recorstruction of the navy, which 
under Alexander I. had been suffered to decay. Yet the newly 
organized squadron which in 1827 set out on the cruise which 
ended at Navarino only reached Plymouth with difficulty, and 
there had to be completely refitted. The disastrous Balkan 
campaign of 1828 was an even more astounding revelation of 
corruption, disorganization and folly in high places; and the 
presence of the emperor did nothing to mitigate the attendant 
evils. He was indefatigable, in war as in peace, in parading and 
inspecting; the weary and starving soldiers were forced to turn 
out amid the marshes of the Dobrudscha as spick and span as on 
the parade grounds of St Petersburg; but he cculd do nothing 
to set order in the confusion of the commissariat, which caused 
the troops to die like flies of dysentery and scurvy; or to remedy 
the scandals of the hospitals, which inflicted on the wounded 
unspeakable sufferings. On the other hand, his presence was 
sufficient to hamper the initiative of Prince Wittgenstein, the 
nominal commander-in-chief; for Nicholas was constitutionally 
incapable of leaving him a free hand. This was one reason for 
the failure of the opening campaign. 1 Another was more 
creditahle to the tsar's heart than to his head; he turned from 
the sight of wounds and blood, and would not make up his 
mind to sanction operations which, at the cost of a few hundred 
lives, would have saved thousands who perished miserably of 
disease. 2 

These then were the leading principles which underlay 
Nicholas's domestic and foreign poh'cy from first to last: to 
discipline Russia, and by means of a disciplined Russia to 
discipline the world. So far as the latter task was concerned, 
he again sharply divided the issues which Alexander had con- 
fused. The mission of Russia in the West was, in accordance 
with the principles of the Holy Alliance as Nicholas interpreted 
them, to uphold the cause of legitimacy and autocracy against 
the Revolution; her mission in the East was, with or without 
the co-operation of " Europe," to advance the cause of Orthodox 
Christianity, of which she was the natural protector, at the 
expense of the decaying Ottoman empire. The sympathy of 
Europe with the insurgent Greeks gave the tsar his opportunity. 
The duke of Wellington was sent to St Petersburg in 1826 to 

	Nicholas remained in Russia in 1829, and Diabitsch had a free 
	hand. 

	He once sentenced an unhappy Jew to run the gauntlet of 10,000 
	strokes, exclaiming as he signed the warrant, " Thank God, we have 
	no capital punishment in Russia! " Yet his nature had its kindly 
	side: " He feels kindness deeply — and his love for his wife and 
	children, and for all children, is very great " (Queen Victoria, loc. cit). 
	He also spent much personal effort in organizing the charitable 
	institutions of the dowager empress Maria, and founded a great 
	number of institutions for technical education. 

congratulate the new tsar on his accession and arrange a concert 
in the Eastern Question. The upshot proved the diplomatic 
value of Nicholas's apparent sincerity of purpose and charm of 
manner; the "Iron Duke" was to the "Iron Tsar" as soft 
iron to steel; Great Britain, without efficient guarantees for the 
future, stood committed to the policy which ended in the de- 
struction of the Ottoman sea-power at Navarino and the march 
of the Russians on Constantinople. By the treaty of Adrianople 
in 1829 Turkey seemed to become tittle better than a vassal 
state of the tsar, a relation intensified, after the first revolt of 
Mehemet Ali, by the treaty of Unkiar-Skelessi in 1833 (see 
Mehemet Ali). In the West, meanwhile, the revolutions of 
1830 had modified the balance of forces. Nicholas himself 
proposed an armed intervention of the Alliance in order " to 
restore order" in Belgium and France;* and when his allies 
held back even proposed to intervene alone, a project rendered 
impossible by the outbreak of the great insurrection in Poland, 
which tied the hands of all three powers (see Poland: History). 
In the circumstances, Nicholas was forced to give a grudging 
recognition to the title of Louis Philippe as king of the French; 
his recognition of that of Leopold, king of the Belgians, was 
postponed until King William of the Netherlands had finally 
resigned his rights. Then, the insurrection in Poland once 
crushed, and Poland itself scarce surviving even as a geographical 
expression, 4 he drew the three eastern autocratic powers together 
in a new " Holy Alliance " by the secret convention of Berlin 
(3rd Oct, 1833) reaffirming the right and duty of intervention at 
the request of a legitimate sovereign. The cordial understanding 
with Austria, cemented at Munchengratz and Berlin, was 
renewed, after the accession of the emperor Ferdinand, at 
Prague and Toplitz (1835) ; on the latter occasion it was decided 
" without difficulty " to suppress the republic of Cracow, as 
a centre of revolutionary agitation. 6 The Triple Alliance was 
now, in the tsar's opinion, " the last anchor of safety for the 
monarchical cause." To its maintenance he had sacrificed " his 
religious convictions" and " the traditions of Russian poh'cy " 
in consenting to uphold the integrity of Turkey; a sacrifice 
perhaps the less hard to make since, as he added, the Ottoman 
empire no longer existed. 6 He allowed himself to be persuaded 
by Metternich to support the cause of Don Carlos in Spain, 7 
and so early as May 1837, in view of the agitation in Hungary, 
he announced that " in every case " Austria might count on 
Russia. 

These cordial ties were loosened, however, by the fresh crisis 
in the Eastern Question after 1838. Metternich was anxious to 
summon a European conference to Vienna, with a view to placing 
Turkey under a collective guarantee. To Nicholas this seemed 
to be a blow aimed at Russia, and he refused to be a party to it. 8 
Moreover, in view of the tendency of Austria to forget the con- 
ventions of Munchengratz and Toplitz, and to approach the 
maritime powers, he determined to checkmate her by himself 
coming to an agreement with Great Britain, in order to settle the 
\Eastern Question according to his own views: a double gain, 
if by this means Queen Victoria (a " legitimate " sovereign) could 
be drawn away from her unholy alliance with the Jacobin Louis 
Philippe. This is the explanation of those concessions in the 
Eastern Question which ended in the Quadruple Alliance of 
1840 and the humiliation of Louis Philippe's government (see 
Mehemet Ali). 

The new Anglo-Russian entente led in 1844 to a visit of the 

	4 Martens, Recueil, viii. 16*1, &c, especially the autograph mem.

tsar to the English court. This visit, in spite of the favourable 
personal impression made by the emperor, was the starting-point 
of a fresh and fateful divergence; for it was now that the tsar 
first openly raised the question of the eventual partition of the 
inheritance of the " Sick Man," as he called Turkey. The whole 
question, however, was indefinitely postponed by the events 
culminating in the revolutions of 1848. Nicholas foresaw the 
troubles brewing, and warned Frederick William IV. of Prussia, 
in a tone of lofty and paternal remonstrance, of the inevitable 
results of his constitutional experiments. When the storm burst, 
he remained entrenched behind the barriers of his own disciplined 
empire; sovereigns truckling in a panic to insurgent democracies 
he would not lift a finger to help; 1 it was not till Francis Joseph 
of Austria in 1849 appealed to him in the name of autocracy, 
reasserting its rights, that he consented to intervene, and, true 
to the promise made at Mtinchengratz in 1833, crushed the 
insurgent Hungarians and handed back their country as a free 
gift to the Habsburg king. Scarcely less valuable to Austria was 
the tsar's intervention in the quarrel between Austria and Prussia 
arising out of the Hesse incident and the general question of the 
hegemony of Germany. In October 1850 he had a meeting with 
Francis Joseph at Warsaw, at which Count Brandenburg and 
Prince Schwarzenberg were present. Prussia, he declared, must 
in the German question return to the basis of the treaties of 181 5 
and renew her entente with Austria; this was the only way of 
preserving the old friendship of Prussia and Russia. In face 
of the threat conveyed in this, the Prussian government decided 
to maintain peace (Nov. 2), Radowitz resigning as a protest. 
Thus Nicholas, who refused to believe in the perfidy ascribed by 
Frederick William to Austria, 2 was the immediate cause of 
Prussia's humiliation at Olmiitz. 

Nicholas was soon to have personal experience of the perfidy 
of Austria. It was a small matter that Count Prokesch-Osten, 
the Austrian ambassador, was discovered to be supplying a 
"foul Jew" editor with copy; more serious was Austria's 
attitude in the troubles that led up to the Crimean War. Grati- 
tude, in the tsar's opinion, should have made her neutral if not 
friendly; the revelation of her ingratitude came upon him 
with the shock of a painful surprise. The first cause of all the 
evils that followed was his attitude towards Napoleon III. He 
was forced to recognize the new French empire, but he would 
recognize no more than the fact of its existence (du fait en lui- 
mime); he refused to address the emperor of the French as a 
brother sovereign. He attempted, moreover, to revive the 
function of the triple alliance as guardian of Europe against 
French aggression. The resentment of Napoleon awakened the 
slumbering Eastern Question by reviving the obsolescent 
claims of France to the guardianship of the Holy Places, and 
this aroused the pride of the Orthodox tsar, their guardian by 
right of faith and in virtue of a clause of the treaty of Kuchuk 
Kainardji (1774), as interpreted in the light of subsequent events. 
Nicholas could not believe that Christian powers would resent 
his claim to protect the Christian subjects of the sultan; he 
believed he could count on the friendship of Austria and Prussia; 
as for Great Britain, he would try to come to a frank under- 
standing with her (hence the famous conversations with Sir 
Hamilton Seymour on the 9th and 14th of January 1853, reviving 
the " Sick Man" arguments of 1844), but in any case he had the 
assurance of Baron Brunnow, his ambassador in London, that the 
influence of Cobden and Bright, the eloquent apostles of peace, 
was enough to prevent her from appealing to arms against him. 

The disillusionment that followed was profound. In October 
1853 Nicholas met his brother monarchs of the triple alliance 
at Warsaw for the last time. In December, at the conference 
of Vienna, Austria had already passed over to the enemy. 
Prussia was wavering, neutral indeed, but joining the other 
powers in a guarantee of the integrity of Turkey (9th April

1854), urging the tsar to accept the decisions of the Vienna 
conference, and on his refusal signing a defensive alliance with 
Austria (April 20, 1854), which included among the casus belli 
the incorporation in Russia of the banks of the Danube and a 
Russian march on Constantinople. Thus Nicholas, the pillar 
of the European alliance, found himself isolated and at war, 
or potentially at war, with all Europe. The invasion of the 
Crimea followed, and with it a fresh revelation of the corruption 
and demoralization of the Russian system. At the outset 
Nicholas had grimly remarked that " Generals January and 
February " would prove his best allies. These acted, however, 
impartially; and if thousands of British and French soldiers 
perished of cold and disease in the trenches before Sevastopol, 
the tracks leading from the centre of Russia into the Crimea 
were marked by the bones of Russian dead. The revelation of 
his failure broke the spirit of the Iron Tsar, and on the 2nd of 
March 1855 he threw away the life which a little ordinary care 
would have saved. 

The character of the emperor Nicholas was summed up with 
great insight by Queen Victoria in a letter to the king of the 
Belgians, written during the tsar's visit to England (June 11, 
1844). " He is stern and severe — with fixed principles of duty 
which nothing on earth will make him change; very clever I do 
not think him, and his mind is an uncivilized one; his education 
has been neglected; polities and military concerns are the only 
things he takes great interest in; the arts and all softer occupa- 
tions he is insensible to, but he is sincere, I am certain, sincere 
even in his most despotic acts, from a sense that that is the only 
way to govern; he is not, I am sure, aware of the dreadful cases 
of individual misery which he so often causes, for I can see by 
various instances that he is kept in utter ignorance of many 
things, which his people carry out in most corrupt ways, while he 
thinks that he is extremely just . . . and I am sure much never 
reaches his ears, and (as you observed) how can it? He is, I 
should say, too frank, for he talks so openly before people,, 
which he should not do, and with difficulty restrains himself. 
His anxiety to be believed is very great, and I must say his personal 
promises I am inclined to believe; then his feelings are very 
strong; he feels kindness deeply. ... He is not happy, and 
that melancholy which is visible in the countenance made me 
sad at times; the sternness of the eyes goes very much off 
when you know him, and changes according to his being put out 
or not He is bald now, but in his chevalier Garde uniform 
he is magnificent still, and very striking." 

The emperor was a kind husband and father, and his domestic 
life was very happy. He had seven children: (1) the emperor 
Alexander II. (q.v.); (2) the grand-duchess Maria (1810-1876), 
duchess of Leuchtenberg; (3) the grand-duchess Olga (1822- 
1892), consort of King Charles of Wiirttemberg; (4) the grand- 
duchess Alexandra (1825-1844), married to Prince Frederick of 
Hesse-Cassel; (5) the grand-duke Constantine Nikolayevich 
(1827-1892); (6) the grand-duke Nicholas Nikolayevich (1831- 
1891); (7) the grand-duke Michael Nikolayevich (b. 1832). 
The second son of the latter, the grand-duke Michael Mikhailovich 
(b. 1 861), who was morganatically married, his wife bearing the 
title of Countess Torby, took up his residence in England.

NICHOLAS II. (1868- ), emperor of Russia, eldest son 
and successor of Alexander III., was born at St Petersburg on 
the 1 8th of May 1868. He received the ordinary education of 
Russian grand-dukes, under the direction of General Danilovitch, 
assisted by M. Pobedonostsev and other eminent professors. 
Among these was an Englishman, Mr Charles Heath, for whom 
he had great respect and affection. By the death of his grand- 
father, Alexander 11., in 1881, he became heir-apparent 
(cesarevich). Though he received, like all the heirs-apparent 
to the Russian throne, a certain amount of military training, 
his personal tastes did not lie in that direction, nor did he show 
any inclination for the boisterous amusements of the jeunesse 
dorle of St Petersburg. Like his father, he was nowhere happier 
than in the family circle, and he was particularly attached to 
his sister, the grand-duchess Xenia, who was seven years younger 
than himself. In .1890-1891 he made a tour in Greece, Egypt, 
India, Ceylon and Japan, where he narrowly escaped assassina- 
tion at the hands of a Japanese fanatic. On the return journey 
by Siberia, at Vladivostok, he turned the first sod of the eastern 
section of the Siberian railway, and two years afterwards (1893) 
he was appointed president of the imperial committee for that 
great undertaking. By the death of his father on the 1st of 
November 1894 he became emperor, and on the 26th of that 
month he married Princess Alix of Hesse (a grand-daughter of 
Queen Victoria), to whom he had been betrothed in the presence 
of his father during the latter's last illness. Eighteen months 
later the coronation took place at Moscow with great pomp, 
but a gloom was thrown over the festivities by the unfortunate 
incident of the Khodinskoe Polye, a great open space near the 
city, where a popular fete had been prepared and where, from 
defective police arrangements, a large number of men, women 
and children, roughly estimated at 2000, were crushed and 
trampled to death. Nicholas II. followed in the footsteps of 
his father, seeking to preserve peace in foreign relations, and 
continuing in home affairs, though in a much milder form, the" 
policy of centralization and Russification Which had characterized 
the previous reign. His pacific tendencies were shown by his 
systematic opposition to all bellicose excitement, by his maintain- 
ing M. de Giers in the post of minister of foreign affairs, by his 
offering the post, on the death of that statesman, to M. de Staal, 
by his restraining France from dangerous adventures, and by 
initiating the Peace Conference at the Hague. To these ought 
perhaps to be added the transformation of the Franco-Russian 
entente cordiale into a formal alliance, since the alliance in question 
might be regarded as favourable to the preservation of the 
status quo in Europe. In the internal administration during 
the first years of his reign he introduced by his personal influence, 
and without any great change in the laws, a more humane 
spirit towards those of his subjects who did not belong by 
language and tradition to the dominant nationality, and who 
were not members of the Eastern Orthodox Church; but he 
disappointed the men of liberal views by giving it to be clearly 
understood soon after his accession that he had no intention 
of circumscribing and weakening the autocratic power by 
constitutional guarantees or parliamentary institutions. In 
spite, however, of his desire for peace he let his country drift 
into the disastrous war with Japan; and notwithstanding 
his sincere attachment to the principles of bureaucratic autocracy, 
it was he who granted the constitutional reforms which altered 
the whole political outlook in Russia (see Russia). 


NICHOLAS OF BASEL (d. 1397), a prominent member of the 
Beghard community, who travelled widely as a missionary 
and propagated the teachings of his sect. Though vigorously 
sought after by the Inquisition he eluded its agents for many 
years until in 1397 he was seized in Vienna, and burned at 
the stake as a heretic, together with two of his followers, 
John and James. A considerable legend has attached itself to 
Nicholas through the persistent but mistaken identification of 
him with the mysterious " Friend of God from the Oberland," 
the " double" of Rulman Merswin, the Strassburg banker who 
was one of the leaders of the 14th-century German mystics 
known as the Friends of God. In Merswin's Story of the First 
Four Years of a New Life, he writes: " Of all the wonderful 
works which God had wrought in me I was not allowed to tell 
a single word to anybody until the time when it should please 
God to reveal to a man in the Oberland to come to me. When 
he came to me God gave me the power to tell him everything." 
The identity and personality of this " Friend of God," who 
bulks so largely in the great collection of mystical literature, 
and is everywhere treated as a half supernatural character, is 
one of the most difficult problems in the history of mysticism. 
The tradition, dating from the 15th century and supported 
by the weighty authority of the Strassburg historian Karl 
Schmidt (Nicolaus von Basel, Vienna, 1866), identified him 
with Nicholas, but is now discredited by all scholars. A. Jundt 
(Les Amis de Dieu, 1879) shared Preger's view that the Friend 
was a great unknown who lived in or near Chur (Coire) in 
Switzerland. But since Denifle's researches (see especially 
Der Gottesfreund im Olerlande und Nikolaus von Basel, 1870) 
the belief has gained ground that the " Friend " is not a historical 
personage at all. Apart from the collection of literature ascribed 
to him and Merswin there is no historical evidence of his existence. 
The accounts of his life say that about 1343 he was forbidden 
to reveal his identity to anyone save Rulman Merswin. And 
as all the writings bear the marks of a single authorship it has 
been assumed, especially by Denifle, that " the Friend of God " 
is a literary creation of Merswin and that the whole collection 
of literature is the work of Merswin (and his school), tendency- 
literature designed to set forth the ideals of the movement to 
which he had given his life. Thus " the great unknown" from 
the Oberland is the ideal character, " who illustrates how God 
does his work tor the world and for the church through a divinely 
trained and spiritually illuminated layman," just as William 
Langland in England about the same time drew the figure of 
Piers Plowman. 

To rescue Merswin from the charge of deceit involved in 
this theory, Jundt puts forward the suggestion, more ingenious 
than convincing, that Merswin was a " double personality," 
who in his primary state wrote the books ascribed to him, and 
in his secondary state became " the Friend of God from the 
Oberland," writing the other treatises. A third hypothesis 
is that advanced by Karl Rieder {Der Gottesfreund von Oberland, 
Innsbruck, 1905), who thinks that not even Merswin himself 
wrote any of the literature, but that his secretary and associate 
Nicholas of Lowen, head of the House of St John at Griinen worth, 
the retreat founded by Merswin for the circle, worked over all 
the writings which emanated from different members of the 
group but bore no author's names, and to glorify the founder 
of the house attached Merswin 's name to some of them and out 
of his imagination created " the Friend of God from the 
Oberland," whom he named as the writer of the others. As his 
design took shape he expanded the supernatural element and 
made the narratives autobiographical. There is much in this 
contention that is sound, but Rieder seems to go unnecessarily 
far in denying altogether that Merswin wrote any of the mystical 
books. The conclusion remains that the literature must be 
treated as tendency-writing and not as genuine biography and 
history.

NICHOLAS OF GUILDFORD (fl. 1250), English poet, the 
supposed author of The Owl and the Nightingale, an English 
poem of the 13th century. This work, which displays genuine 
poetical and imaginative qualities, is written in the south- 
western dialect, and is one of the few 13th-century English poems 
not devoted entirely to religious topics. The nightingale sitting 
on a branch covered with blossom sees the owl perched on a 
bough overgrown with ivy, and proceeds to abuse him for his 
general habits and appearance. The birds decide to refer the 
consequent dispute to Master Nicholas de Guildford, who is 
skilled in such questions, but they first of all engage in a regular 
dtbat in the French fashion. The owl is the best logician, but the 
nightingale has a fund of abuse that equalizes matters. Finally, 
when the argument threatens to become a fight, the wren 
interferes, and the two go to the house of Master Nicholas at Por- 
tisham in Dorset. He judges, they say, many right judgments, 
and composes and writes much wisdom, and it is lamentable that 
so learned and worthy a man should gain no preferment from 
his bishop. The poet, whoever he was, wrote the octosyllabic 
couplet with ease and smoothness. He borrows something from 
Alexander of Neckham's De naturis rerum, and was certainly 
familiar with contemporary French poetry. The piece is a 
general allegory of the contest between asceticism and a more 
cheerful view of religion, and is capable of a particular application 
to the differences between the regular orders and the secular 
clergy. The nightingale defends her singing on the ground 
that heaven is a place of song and mirth, while the owl maintains 
that much weeping for his many sins is man's best preparation 
for the future. 

There are two MSS. of the Hide amd the Nightingale, MS. Cotton 
Caligula A ix. (British Museum), dating from the first half of the 
13th century, and MS. Arch. I. 29, Jesus College, Oxford, written 
about half a century later. In the Jesus College MS. the poem is 
immediately preceded by a religious poem entitled La Passyun Jhu 
Christ, which, according to a note on it, once possessed an additional 
quatrain implying that it was written by John of Guildford, perhaps 
a relation of Nicholas. 

The Owl and the Nightingale has been edited from the Cotton MS. 
chiefly for the Roxburghe Club (1838) by Joseph Stevenson, and for 
the Percy Society (1843) by T. Wright; the best edition is by F. H. 
Stratmann (Krefeld, 1868), who collated the two MSS. See also B.

criticism see A.E. Egge in Modern Language M>fes(BaltimoreJanuary,

NICHOLAS, SIR EDWARD (1593-1669), English statesman, 
eldest son of John Nicholas, a member of an old Wiltshire family, 
was born on the 4th of April 1 593. He was educated at Salisbury 
grammar school, Winchester College and Queen's College, 
Oxford. After studying law at the Middle Temple, Nicholas 
became secretary to Lord Zouch, warden and admiral of the 
Cinque ports, in 1618, and continued in a similar employment 
under the duke of Buckingham. In 1625 he became secretary 
to the admiralty; shortly afterwards he was appointed an extra 
clerk of the privy council with duties relating to admiralty 
business, and from 1635 to 1641 he was one of the clerks in 
ordinary to the council. In this situation Nicholas had much 
business to transact in connexion with the levy of ship-money; 
and in 1641, when Charles I. went to Scotland, a heavy responsi- 
bility rested on the secretary who remained in London to keep 
the king informed of the proceedings of the parliament. On 
the return of Charles to the capital Nicholas was knighted, and 
appointed a privy councillor and a secretary of state, in which 
capacity he attended the king while the court was at Oxford, 
and carried out the business of the treaty of Uxbridge. Through- 
out this troubled period he was one of Charles's wisest and most 
loyal advisers; he it was who arranged the details of the king's 
surrender to the Scots, though he does not appear to have 
advised or even to have approved of the step; and to him also 
fell the duty of treating for the capitulation of Oxford, which 
included permission for Nicholas himself to retire abroad with 
his family. He went to France, being recommended by the 
king to the confidence of the prince of Wales. After the king's 
death Nicholas remained on the continent concerting measures 
on behalf of the exiled Charles II. with Hyde and other royalists, 
but the hostility of Queen Henrietta Maria deprived him of any 
real influence in the counsels of the young sovereign. He lived 
at the Hague and elsewhere in a state of poverty which hampered 
his power to serve Charles, but which the latter did nothing 
to relieve. He returned to England at the Restoration; but 
although Charles had formally appointed him secretary of state 
in 1654, this office was now conferred on another, and Nicholas 
had to content himself with a grant of money and the offer of 
a peerage, which his poverty compelled him to decline. He 
retired to a country seat in Surrey which he purchased from a 
son of Sir Walter Raleigh, and here he lived till his death in 
1669. By his wife Jane, a daughter of Henry Jay, an alderman 
of London, he had several sons and daughters; his younger 
brother Matthew Nicholas (1594-1661) was successively dean 
of Bristol," canon of Westminster and dean of St Paul's. 

See The Nicholas Papers, edited by G. F. Warner (Camden Society, 
London, 1886-1897), containing Nicholas's correspondence and some 
autobiographical memoranda. Private correspondence between 
Nicholas and Charles I. will be found in the Memoirs of John Evelyn, 
edited by W. Bray (London, 1827); The Edgerton MSS. and the 
Ormonde Papers contain many references to Nicholas. 


NICHOLAS (or Niclaes), HENRY (or Hendrik) (c. 1501-c, 
1 580), founder of the sect called" the Family of Love," was born 
in 1 501 or 1502, at Miinster, where he was married and carried on 
the business of a mercer. As a boy he was subject to visions, 
and at the age of twenty-seven charges of heresy led to his 
imprisonment. About 1530 he removed with his family to 
Amsterdam, where he was again imprisoned on a charge of 
complicity in the Miinster revolution of 1 534-1 535. About 1539 
he experienced a call to found his " Familia Caritatis." Remov- 
ing to Embden, he lived there and prospered in business for 
twenty years, though he travelled with commercial as well as 
missionary objects into the Netherlands, England and elsewhere. 
The date of his sojourn in England has been placed as early as 
1552 and as late as 1569. In 1579 he was living at Cologne, 
where probably he died a year or two later. His doctrines seem 
to have been derived largely from the Dutch Anabaptist David 
Joris or George, who died in 1556; but they have mainly to be 
inferred from the jaundiced accounts of hostile writers. The 
outward trappings of his system were merely Anabaptist; but 
he anticipated a good many later speculations, and his followers 
were accused of asserting that all things were ruled by nature 
and not directly by God, of denying the dogma of the Trinity, 
and repudiating infant baptism. They held that no man should 
be put to death for his opinions, and apparently, like the later 
Quakers, they objected to the carrying of arms and to anything 
like an oath; and they were quite impartial in their repudiation 
of all other churches and sects, including Brownists and 
Barrowists. 

Nicholas's principal disciple in England was one Christopher 
Vitel, and towards 1579 the progress of the sect especially in the 
eastern counties provoked literary attacks, proclamations and 
parliamentary bills. But Nicholas's followers escaped the 
gallows and the stake, for they combined with some success the 
wisdom of the serpent and the harmlessness of the dove. They 
would only discuss their doctrines with sympathizers; they 
showed every respect for authority, and considered outward con- 
formity a duty. This quietist attitude, while it saved them from 
molestation, hampered propaganda; and though the " Family " 
existed until the middle of the 1 7th century, it was then swallowed 
up by the Quakers, Baptists and Unitarians, all of which de- 
nominations may have derived some of their ideas through the 
" Family " from the Anabaptists. 

The list of Nicholas's works occupies nearly six columns in 
the Diet. Nat. Biogr. See also Belfort Bax, Rise and Fall of the 
Anabaptists, pp. 327-380 (1903); and Strype's Works, General

NICHOLS, JOHN (1745-1826), English printer and author, 
was born at Islington on the 2nd of February 1745. He edited 
the Gentleman's Magazine from 1788 till his death, and in the 
pages of that periodical, and in his numerous volumes of Anecdotes 
and Illustrations, he made invaluable contributions to the personal 
history of English men of letters in the 18th century. He was 
apprenticed in 1757 to " the learned printer," William Bowyer, 
whom he eventually succeeded. On the death of his friend and 
master in 1777 he published a brief memoir, which afterwards 
grew into the Anecdotes of William Bowyer and Ms Literary 
Friends (1782). As his materials accumulated he compiled a sort 
of anecdotical literary history of the century, based on a large 
collection of important letters. The Literary Anecdotes of the 
18th Century (1812-1815), into which the original work was 
expanded, forms only a small part of Nichols's production. It 
was followed by the Illustrations of the Literary History of the 
18th Century, consisting of Authentic Memoirs and Original 
Letters of Eminent Persons, which was begun in 18 17 and com- 
pleted by his son John Bowyer Nichols (1779-1863) in 1858. 
The Anecdotes and the Illustrations are mines of valuable in- 
formation on the authors, printers and booksellers of the time. 

Nichols's other works include: A Collection of Royal and 
Noble Wills (1780); Select Collection of Miscellaneous Poems 
(1782), with subsequent additions, in which he was helped by 
Joseph Warton and by Bishops Percy and Lowth; BibliotJieca 
Topographica Britannica (1 780-1 790); with Richard Gough, 
The Progresses and Public Processions of Queen Elizabeth (1788); 
and the important History and Antiquities of the Town and County 
of Leicester (1795-1815). Nichols was a fellow of the Society of 
Antiquaries, a trustee of many city institutions, and in 1804 he 
was master of the Stationers' Company, He died on the 26th 
of November 1826. John Bowyer Nichols continued his father's 
various undertakings, and wrote, with other works, A Brief 
Account of the Guildhall of the City of London (1819). His eldest 
son, John Gough Nichols (1806-1873), was also a printer and a 
distinguished antiquary, who edited the Gentleman's Magazine 
from 1851 to 1856, and the Herald and Genealogist from 1863 to 
1874, and was one of the founders of the Camden Society. 

A full Memoir of John Nichols by Alexander Chalmers is contained 
in the Illustrations, and a bibliography in the Anecdotes (vol. vi.) is 
supplemented in the later work. See also R. C. Nichols, Memoirs of 
J. G. Nichols (1874). ^ m 


NICHOLSON, HENRY ALLEYNE (1844-1899), British palaeon- 
tologist and zoologist, son of Dr John Nicholson, a biblical 
scholar, was born at Penrith on the nth of September 1844. 
He was educated at Appleby Grammar School and at the uni- 
versities of Gottingen (Ph.D., 1866) and Edinburgh (D.Sc., 
1867; M.D., 1869). Geology had early attracted his attention, 
and his first publication was a thesis for his D.Sc. degree On the 
Geology of Cumberland and Westmoreland (1868). In 1871 he was 
appointed professor of natural history in the university of 
Toronto, in 1874 professor of biology in the Durham College of 
Science and in 1875 professor of natural history in the university 
of St Andrews. This last post he held until i882,whenhebecame 
regius professor of natural history in the university of Aber- 
deen. He was elected F.R.S. in 1897. His original work was 
mainly on fossil invertebrata (graptolites, stromatoporoids and 
corals); but he did much field work, especially in the Lake 
district, where he laboured in company with Professor R. 
Harkness and afterwards with Dr J.E. Marr. He was awarded 
the Lyell Medal by the Geological Society in 1888. He died at 
Aberdeen on the 19th of January 1899.

NICHOLSON, JOHN (1822-1857), Anglo-Indian soldier and 
administrator, son of Alexander Nicholson, a north of Ireland 
physician, was born on the nth of December 1822 and educated 
at Dungannon College. He was presented with a cadetship in 
the Bengal infantry in 1839 by his uncle Sir James Hogg, and 
served in the first Afghan War of 1839-42; he distinguished 
himself in the defence of Ghazni, and was one of the prisoners 
who were carried to Bamian and escaped by bribing the guard 
upon General Pollock's successful advance. It was in Afghanistan 
that Nicholson first met Sir Henry Lawrence, who got him the 
appointment of political officer in Kashmir and subsequently 
on the Punjab frontier. In 1847 he was given charge of the Sirid 
Sagar district, and did much to pacify the country after the first 
Sikh War. On the seizure of Multan by Mulraj, he rendered 
great service in securing the country from Attock, and was 
wounded in an attack upon a tower in the Margalla Pass, where 
a monument was subsequently erected to his memory. On the 
outbreak of the second Sikh War he was appointed political 
officer to Lord Gough's force, when he rendered great service in 
the collection of intelligence and in furnishing supplies and boats. 

On the annexation of the Punjab he was appointed deputy 
commissioner of Bannu. There he became a kind of legendary 
hero, and many tales are told of his stern justice, his tireless 
activity and his commanding personality. In the course of five 
years he reduced the most turbulent district on the frontier 
to such a state of quietude that no crime was committed or even 
attempted during his last year of office, a condition of things 
never known before or since. On one occasion, being attacked 
by a ghazi, he snatched the musket from the hand of a sentry 
and shot the man dead; on another occasion he put a price 
on the head of a notorious outlaw, and finding every one afraid 
to earn it, rode single-handed to the man's village, met him in 
the street and cut him down. But besides being a severe ruler, 
Nicholson was eminently just. A criminal had no chance of 
escaping him, so able and determined was his investigation; 
and a corrupt official could not long evade his vigilance; but he 
was deliberate in his punishments, and gave offenders a chance 
to redeem their character. He would go personally to the scene 
of a crime or a legal dispute and decide the question on the spot. 
Every man in his district, whether mountain tribesman or 
policeman, felt that he was controlled by a master hand, and the 
natives said of him that " the tramp of his war-horse could be 
heard from Attock to the Khyber." Lord Roberts says of him 
in Forty-One Years in India: " Nicholson impressed me more 
profoundly than any man I had ever met before, or have ever 
met since. I have never seen any one like him. He was the 
beau idial of a soldier and a gentleman." It is little wonder that 
the natives worshipped him as a god under the title of Nikalsain. 
Nicholson, however, had a fiery temper and a contempt for red 
tape, which made him a somewhat intractable subordinate. 
He had a serious quarrel with Sir Neville Chamberlain, and was 
continually falling out with Sir John Lawrence, who succeeded 
his brother Henry as ruler of the Punjab. 

It was when the Mutiny broke out in May 1857 that Nicholson 
was able to show the metal that was in him, and he did more 
than any other single man to keep the Punjab loyal and to bring 
about the fall 6i Delhi. When the news of the rising at Meerut 
arrived, Nicholson was with Edwardes at Peshawar, and they 
took immediate steps to disarm the doubtful regiments in that 
cantonment. Together they opposed Sir John Lawrence's 
proposal to abandon Peshawar, in order to concentrate all their 
strength on the siege of Delhi. In June Nicholson was appointed 
to the command of a movable column, with which he again 
disarmed two doubtful regiments at Phillaur. In July he made 
a forced march of 41 m. in a single day in the terrific heat of the 
Punjab summer, in order to intercept the mutineers from Sialkot, 
who were marching upon Delhi. He caught them on the banks 
of the Ravi near Gurdaspur, and utterly destroyed them, thus 
successfully achieving what hardly any other man would have 
attempted. In August he had pacified the Punjab and was free 
to reinforce General Wilson on the Ridge before Delhi. An officer 
who served in the siege gives the following word picture of him 
as he appeared at this time: — 

" He was a man cast in a giant mould, with massive chest and 
powerful limbs, and an expression ardent and commanding, with a 
dash of roughness; features of stern beauty, a long black beard, and 
a deep sonorous voice. There was something of immense strength, 
talent and resolution in his whole frame and manner, and a power of 
ruling men on high occasions which no one could escape noticing. 
His imperial air, which never left him, and which would have been 
thought arrogant in one of less imposing mien, sometimes gave 
offence to the more unbending of his countrymen, but made him 
almost worshipped by the pliant Asiatics." 

Before Nicholson's arrival the counsels of the commanders 
before Delhi, like those at Meerut, suffered from irresolution 
and timidity. As General Wilson's health declined, his caution 
became excessive, and Nicholson was specially sent by Sir John 
Lawrence to put more spirit into the attack. His first exploit 
after his arrival was the victory of Najafgarh, which he won 
over the rebels who were attempting to intercept the British 
siege train from Ferozepore. After marching through a flooded 
country scarcely practicable for his guns, Nicholson, with a 
force of 2500 troops, defeated 6000 disciplined sepoys after an 
hour's fighting, and thenceforth put an end to all attempts 
of the enemy to get in the rear of the British position on the 
Ridge. Nicholson grew fiercely impatient of General Wilson's 
procrastination, and at one time was thinking of appealing to 
the army to set Wilson aside and elect a successor; but at last, 
on the 13th of September, he forced Wilson to make up his mind 
to the assault, and he himself was chosen to lead the attacking, 
column. On the morning of the 14th he led his column, 1000 
strong, in the attack on the Kashmir gate, and successfully 
entered the streets of Delhi. But in trying to clear the ramparts 
as far as the Lahore Gate, he undertook a task beyond the powers 
of his wearied troops. In encouraging them as they hesitated, 
he turned his back on the enemy and was shot in the back. The 
wound was mortal, but his magnificent physique allowed him 
to linger for nine days before finally succumbing on the 23rd of 
September. 

His best epitaph is found in the words of Sir John Lawrence's 
Mutiny Report: — 

" Brigadier-General John Nicholson is now beyond human praise 
and human reward. But so long as British rule shall endure in India, 
his fame can never perish. He seems especially to have been raised 
up for this juncture. He crowned a bright, though brief, career by 
dying of the wound he received in the moment of victory at Delhi. 
The Chief Commissioner does not hesitate to affirm that without 
John Nicholson Delhi could not have fallen."

NICHOLSON, WILLIAM (1753-1815), English writer on natural 
philosophy, was born in London in 1753, and after leaving school 
made two voyages as midshipman in the East India service. 
He subsequently entered an attorney's office, but, having become 
acquainted, in 1775, with Josiah Wedgwood, he lived for some 
years at Amsterdam as agent for the sale of pottery. On his 
return to England he was induced by Thomas Holcroft to devote 
himself to the composition of fight literature for periodicals, 
assisting that writer also with some of his plays and novels. 
Meanwhile he employed himself on the preparation of An Intro- 
duction lo Natural Philosophy, which was published in 1781 and 
was at once successful. A translation of Voltaire's Elements of 
the Newtonian Philosophy soon followed, and he now entirely 
devoted himself to scientific pursuits and philosophical journalism. 
In 1784 he was appointed secretary to the General Chamber of 
Manufacturers of Great Britain, and he was also connected with 
the Society for the Encouragement of Naval Architecture, estab- 
lished in 1 79 1. He bestowed much attention upon the construc- 
tion of various machines for comb-cutting, file-making, cylinder 
printing, &c; he also invented an areometer. In 1800 he began 
in London a course of public lectures on natural philosophy and 
chemistry, and about this period he made the discovery of the 
decomposition of water by the voltaic current. In 1797 the 
Journal of Natural Philosophy, Chemistry and the Arts, generally 
known as Nicholson's Journal, the earliest work of the kind in 
Great Britain, was begun; it was carried on till 1814. During 
the later years of his life Nicholson's attention was chiefly directed 
to waterworks engineering at Portsmouth, at Gosport and in 
Southwark. He died in London on the 21st of May 1815. 

Besides considerable contributions to the Philosophical Trans* 
actions, Nicholson wrote translations of Fourcroy's Chemistry (1787) 
and Chaptal's Chemistry (1788), First Principles of Chemistry (1788) 
and a Chemical Dictionary (1795) ; he also edited the British Encyclo- 
paedia, or Dictionary of Arts and Sciences (6 vols., 8vo, London, 1809). 


NICHOLSON, WILLIAM (1784-1844), Scottish painter, was 
born at Newcastle-on-Tyne. Having settled in Edinburgh, he 
painted portraits both in oil and water-colour; and along with 
Thomas Hamilton the architect he was one of the founders and 
most vigorous promoters of the Scottish Academy, of which 
he became the first secretary (1826-1833). In 1818 he published 
a series of etchings entitled Portraits of Distinguished Living 
Characters of Scotland, including Sir Walter Scott, Lord Jeffrey, 
Robert Burns and Professor Wilson. 


NICIAS, I. (d. 414 B.C.) , a soldier and statesman in ancient Athens, 
inherited from his father Niceratus a considerable fortune in- 
vested mainly in the silver mines of Laurium. Evidence of his 
wealth is found in the fact that he had no less than 1000 slaves 
whom he hired out. He gravitated naturally to the aristocratic 
party, and was several times colleague with Pericles in the 
strategia. On the death of Pericles he was left leader of the 
aristocrats against the advanced party of Cleon (q.v.). He 
made use of his wealth both to buy off enemies (especially in- 
formers) and to acquire popularity by the magnificent way in 
which he discharged various public services, especially those 
connected with the state religion, of which he was a strong 
supporter. In the field he displayed extreme caution, and prior 
to the great Sicilian expedition achieved a number of minor 
military successes. In 421 he took a prominent part in the 
arrangement of the " Peace of Nicias," which terminated the 
first decade of the Peloponnesian War (q.v.). He now entered 
with varying success upon a period of rivalry with Alcibiades, 
the details of which are largely matters of conjecture. So bitter 
was the strife that the ostracism of one seemed inevitable, but 
by a temporary coalition they secured instead the banishment 
of the demagogue Hyperbolus (417). In 415 he was appointed 
with Alcibiades and Lamachus to command the Sicilian ex- 
pedition, and, after the flight of Alcibiades (q.v.) and the death 
of Lamachus, was practically the sole commander, the much 
more capable Demosthenes, who was sent to his aid, being 
apparently of comparatively little weight. How far it is just to 
atwrVtfe to his excessive caution and his blind faith in omens 
the disastrous failure it is difficult to say. At all events it is 
clear that the management of so great an enterprise was a task 
far beyond his powers. He was a man of conventional respect- 
ability and mechanical piety, without the originality which was 
required to meet the crisis which faced him. His popularity 
with the aristocratic party in Athens is, however, strikingly 
shown by the lament of Thucydides over his death: " He 
assuredly, among all Greeks of my time, least deserved to come 
to so extreme a pitch of ill-fortune, considering his exact per- 
formance of established duties to the divinity " (vii. 86, Grote's 
version). 

Besides Thucydides see Plutarch's Nicias and Diod. xii. 83; also 
the general authorities on the history of Greece, and the article 
Peloponnesian War. 


NICIAS, son of Nicomedes, an Attic painter of the 4th century 
B.C. Pliny (xxxv. 131) gives a list of his works. He was associ- 
ated with Praxiteles, whose statues he coloured, thus adding to 
their value. 


NICKEL (symbol Ni, atomic weight 58-68 (0=i6)),a metallic 
element. It has been known from the earliest times, being 
employed by the Chinese in the form of an alloy called pakfong. 
It was first isolated in an impure condition in 1751 by A. F. 
Cronstedt from niccolite, and his results were afterwards con- 
firmed by T. 0. Bergman in 1775 (De niccolo,opusc. 2, p. 231; 
3, p. 459; 4, p. 374). It occurs in the uncombined condition 
and alloyed with iron in meteorites; as sulphide in millerite 
and nickel blende, as arsenide in niccolite and cloanthite, and 
frequently in combination with arsenic and antimony in the form 
of complex sulphides. In recent years it has been found in 
considerable quantities in New Caledonia in • the form of a 
hydrated silicate of nickel and magnesia approximating to the 
constitution (NiO, MgO)Si(VnHjQ (J. Gamier, 1865), and in 
Canada in the form of nickeliferous pyrrhotines, which consist 
of sulphides of iron associated with sulphides of nickel and 
copper, embedded in a matrix of gneiss. At the present time 
nickel is obtained practically entirely from garnierite and the 
nickeliferous pyrrhotines. When the former is used it is roasted 
with calcium sulphate or alkali waste to form a matte which is 
then blown in a Bessemer converter or heated in a reverberatory 
furnace with a siliceous flux with the object of forming a rich 
nickel sulphide. This sulphide is then by further heating con- 
verted into the oxide and finally reduced to the state of metal 
by ignition with carbon in clay crucibles. The process adopted 
for the Canadian ores, which are poor in copper and nickel, 
consists in a preliminary roasting in heaps and smelting in a blast 
furnace in order to obtain a matte, which is then further smelted 
with a siliceous flux for a rich matte. This rich matte is then 
mixed with coke and salt-cake and melted down in an open 
hearth furnace. The nickel sulphide so obtained is then roasted 
to oxide and reduced to metal. For a wet method of extraction 
of the matte see Christofle and Bouilhet, French Patent 111591 
(1876). L. Mond (Jour. Soc. Chem. Ind. 1895, p. 945) has 
obtained metallic nickel from the Canadian mattes by first 
roasting them and then eliminating copper by the action of 
sulphuric acid, the product so obtained being then exposed to 
the reducing action of producer gas at about 350 C. The 
reduced metal is then passed into a " volatilizer " and exposed 
to the action of carbon monoxide at about 8o° C, the nickel 
carbonyl so formed being received in a chamber heated to 
180-200 C, where it decomposes, the nickel being deposited and 
the carbon monoxide returned to the volatilizer. For an electro- 
lytic method of treating mattes, see T. Ulke, Moniteur sclent., 
1897, 49, p. 450. The metal as obtained by industrial methods 
rarely contains more than about 90-99-5% of nickel, the chief 
impurities being copper, iron, cobalt, silicon and carbon.

The metal may also be obtained on the small scale by the 
reduction of the oxide by hydrogen or by carbon, by ignition 
of the oxalate or of nickel ammonium oxalate (J. J. Berzelius), 
by reduction of the chloride in a current of hydrogen (E. Peligot), 
by electrolysis of nickel ammonium sulphate (Winkler, Zeit. 
anorg. Chem. 1894, 8, p. 1), and by reduction of the chloride 
with calcium carbide. 

It is a greyish white metal, and is very malleable and ductile. 
Its specific gravity varies according to the method employed for 
its preparation, the extreme values being 8*279 ^d 9-25. It 
melts between 1400-1600 C. Its specific heat increases with 
rise of temperature, the mean value from 15 to ioo° C. being 
0-1084 (A. Naccari, Gazz., 1888, 18, p. 13). It is magnetic, but 
loses its magnetism when heated, the loss being complete at about 
340-3 50 C. On the physical constants see H. Copaux, Comptes 
rendus, 1905, 140, p. 651. Nickel occludes hydrogen readily, is 
attacked by the halogen elements, and oxidizes easily when 
heated in air. In the massive state it is unacted upon by dry air, 
but if moistened with acidified water, oxidation takes place slowly. 
When obtained by reduction processes at as low a temperature 
as possible the finely divided metal so formed is pyrophoric, and 
according to P. Schutzenberger (Comptes rendus, 1891, 113, p. 177) 
dry hydrochloric acid gas converts this form into nickel chloride 
and a volatile compound of composition NiHCl. It decomposes 
water at a red heat. According to E. St Edme (Comptes rendus, 
1886, 106, p. 1079) sheet nickel is passive to nitric acid, and 
the metal remains passive even when heated to redness in a 
current of hydrogen. On the reduction of organic compounds by 
hydrogen in the presence of metallic nickel see P. Sabatier and 
J. B. Senderens, Ann. Chim. Phys. t 1905 [8], 4,PP-3 I 9,433- 

It rapidly oxidizes when fused with caustic soda, but is 
scarcely acted upon by caustic potash (W. Dittmar, Jour. Soc. 
Chem. Ind. } 1884, 3, p. 103). Hydrochloric and sulphuric acids 
are almost without action on the metal, but it dissolves readily 
in dilute nitric acid. Nickel salts are antiseptic; they arrest 
fermentation and stop the growth of plants. Nickel carbonyl, 
however, is extremely poisonous. On the toxic properties of 
nickel salts see A. Riche and Laborde, Jour. Pharm. Chem., 1888, 
[5], 17, pp. 1, 59,97. 

Nickel is used for the manufacture of domestic utensils, for 
crucibles, coinage, plating, and for the preparation of various 
alloys, such as German silver, nickel steels such as invar (nickel, 
35'7%> steel, 64*3%), which has a negligible coefficient of 
thermal expansion, and constantan (nickel, 45%; copper, 55%), 
which has a negligible thermal coefficient of its electrical resist- 
ance. 

Compounds* 
Nickel Oxides. — Several oxides of nickel are known. A suboxide, 
NijO (?), described by W. Muller (Pogg. Ann., 1869, 212, p. 59), is 
not certainly known. The monoxide, NiO, occurs naturally as 
bunsenite, and is obtained artificially when nickel hydroxide, 
carbonate, nitrate or sulphate is heated. It may also be prepared by 
the action of nickel on water, by the reduction of the oxide Ni 2 Oj 
with hydrogen at about 200 C. (H. Moissan, Ann. Chim. Phys., 
[5l. 21, p. 199), or by heating nickel chloride with sodium carbonate 
and extracting the fused mass with water. It is a green powder 
which becomes yellow when heated. It dissociates at a red heat, and 
is readily reduced to the metal when heated with carbon or in a 
current of hydrogen. It is readily soluble in acids, forming salts, the 
rate of solution beings rapid if the oxide is in the amorphous condition, 
but slow if the oxide is crystalline. The hydroxide, Ni(OH)*, is 
obtained in the form of a greenish amorphous powder when nickel 
salts are precipitated by the caustic alkalis. It is readily soluble in 
acids and in an aqueous solution of ammonia. Nickel sesquioxide y 
Ni 2 0», is formed when the nitrate is decomposed by heat at the low est 
possible temperature, by a similar decomposition of the chlorate, or 
by fusing the chloride with potassium chlorate. It is a black powder, 
the composition of which is never quite definite, but approximates 
to the formula given above. When  heated with oxy-acids it dissolves, 
with evolution of oxygen, and with hydrochloric acid it evolves 
chlorine. Numerous hydrated forms of the oxide have been de- 
scribed (see W. Wernicke, Pogg. Ann., 1870, 217, p. 122). A 
peroxide, NiO*, has been obtained  in the form • of dinickelite of 
heatingthe monoxide with anhydrous barium, BaO-2NiOj, by 
baryta in the electric furnace (E. Dufau, Comptes rendus, 1896, 123, 
P- 495)- C. Pellini and D. Meneghini (Zeit. anorg. Chem., 1908, 60, 
p. 178) obtained a greyish green powder ol composition NiQrxH 2 0, 
by adding an alcoholic solution of potassium hydrate to nickel- 
chloride and hydrogen peroxide at — 50 c . It has all the reactions of 
hydrogen peroxide, and S. Tanatar (Ber., 1909, 42, p. 1516) regards 
it as NiO-HsO*. An oxide, NiiO«, has been obtained by heating nickel 
chloride in a current of moist oxygen at about 400° C. (H. Baubigny, 
Comptes rendus, 1878, 87, p. 1082), or by heating the sesquioxide in 
hydrogen at 190 C. (H. Moissan, Ann. Chim. Phys., i&po [5], 21, 
p. 199). The former method yields greyish, metallic-looking, 
microscopic crystals, the latter a grey amorphous powder. A 
hydrated form, NUO^HjO, is obtained when the monoxide is fused 
with sodium peroxide at a red heat and the fused mass extracted 
with water. 

Nickel Salts. — Only one series of salts is known, namely those 
corresponding to the monoxide. In the anhydrous state they are 
usually of a yellow colour, whilst in the hydrated condition they are 
green. They may be recognized by the brownish violet colour they 
impart to a borax bead when heated in an oxidizing flame. The 
caustic alkalis added to solutions of nickel salts give a pale green 
precipitate of the hydroxide, insoluble in excess of the precipitant. 
This latter reaction is hindered by the presence of many organic 
acids (tartaric acid, citric acid, &c). Potassium cyanide gives a 
greenish yellow precipitate of nickel cyanide, Ni(CN)j, soluble jn 
excess of potassium cyanide, forming a double salt,Ni(CN)j*2KCN, 
which remains unaltered when boiled with excess of potassium 
cyanide in presence of air (cf. Cobalt). Ammonium sulphide pre- 
cipitates black nickel sulphide, which is somewhat soluble in excess 
of the precipitate (especially if yellow ammonium sulphide be used), 
forming a dark-coloured solution. Ammonium hydroxide gives^ a 
green precipitate of the hydroxide, soluble in excess of ammonia, 
Forming a blue solution. Numerous methods have been devised for 
the separation of nickel and cobalt, the more important of which are : 
— the cobaltinitrite method by which the cobalt isprecipitated in the 
presence of acetic acid by means of potassium nitrite (the alkaline 
earth metals must not be present); the cyanide method 0- v - 
Liebig,i4»n., 1848, 65, p. 244; 1853, 87, p. 128), in which the two metals 
are precipitated by excess of potassium cyanide in alkaline solution, 
bromine being afterwards added and the solution warmed, when the 
nickel is precipitated. The latter method has been modified by 
adding potassium cyanide in slight excess to the solution of the 
mixed salts, heating for some time and then adding mercuric oxide 
and water, the whole being then warmed on the water bath, when a 
precipitate of mercuric oxide and nickel hydroxide is obtained 
(Liebig). M. Ilinski and G. v. Knorre {Ber., 1885, 18, p. 169) 
separate the metals by adding nitroso-jS-naphthol in the presence 
of 50% acetic acid, a precipitate of cobalti nitroso-jS-naphthol, 
[CioH«0(NO)]jCo, insoluble in hydrochloric acid, being formed, whilst 
the corresponding nickel compound dissolves in hydrochloric acid. 
E. Pinerua separates the metals by taking advantage of the fact that 
cobalt chloride is soluble in ether which has been saturated with 
hydrochloric acid gas at low temperature. For an examination of 
the above and other methods see E. Hintz, Zeit. anal. Chem., 1891, 
30, p. 227. 

Nickel fluoride , NiFj, obtained by the action of hydrofluoric acid 
on nickel chloride, crystallizes in yellowish green prisms which 
volatilise above 1000 C. It is difficultly soluble in water, and com- 
bines with the alkaline fluorides to form double salts. Nickel chloride, 
NiClj, is obtained in the anhydrous condition by heating the hydrated 
salt to 140 C, or by gently heating the finely divided metal in a 
current of chlorine. It readily sublimes when heated in a current of 
chlorine, forming golden yellow scales. It is easily reduced when 
heated in hydrogen. It forms crystalline compounds with ammonia 
and the organic bases. It is soluble in alcohol and in water. Three 
hydrated forms are known, viz. a mono-, di-, and hexa-hydrate ; the 
latter ■ being the form usually obtained by the solution of the 
oxide or carbonate in hydrochloric acid. Nickel chloride ammonia, 
NiCV6NHj, is obtained as a white powder when anhydrous nickel 
chloride is exposed to the action of ammonia gas (H. Rose, Pogg. 
Ann., 1830, 96, p. 155), or in the form of blue octahedra by evaporat- 
ing a solution of nickel chloride in aqueous ammonia. When heated 
to ioo° C. it loses four molecules of ammonia. Two hydrated forms 
have been described, one containing three molecules of water and 
the other half a molecule. Numerous double chlorides of nickel and 
other metals are known. The bromide and iodide of nickel resemble 
the chloride and are prepared in a similar fashion. 

Several sulphides of the element have been obtained. A sub- 
sulphide, NijS(?), results when the sulphate is heated with sulphur 
or when the precipitated monosulphide is heated in a current of 
hydrogen. It forms a light yellow amorphous mass which is almost 
insoluble in acids. The monosulphide, NiS, is obtained by heating 
nickel with sulphur, by heating the monoxide with sulphuretted 
hydrogen to a red heat, and by heating potassium sulphide with 
nickel chloride to 160-180 C. When prepared by dry methods it is 
an exceedingly stable, yellowish, somewhat crystalline mass. When 
prepared by the precipitation of nickel salts with alkaline sulphide 
in neutral solution it is a greyish black amorphous compound which 
readily oxidizes in moist air, forming a basic nickel sulphate. The 
freshly precipitated sulphide is soluble in sulphurous acid and some- 
what soluble in hydrochloric acid and yellow ammonium sulphide 
(see H. Baubigny, Compies rendus, 1882, 94, pp. 961, 1183; 95, p. 
34). Nickel sulphate, N1SO4, is obtained anhydrous as a yellow 
powder when any of its hydrates are heated. When heated with 
carbon it is reduced to the metal. It forms hydrates containing one, 
two, five, six and seven molecules of water. The heptahydrate is 
obtained by dissolving the metal or its oxide, hydroxide or carbonate 
in dilute sulphuric acid (preferably in the presence of a small quantity 
of nitric acid), and allowing the solution to crystallize between 15® 
and 20 C. It crystallizes in emerald-green rhombic prisms and is 
moderately soluble in water. It effloresces gradually on exposure to 
air and passes into the hexahydrate. It loses four molecules of water 
of crystallization when heated to 100° C. and becomes anhydrous at 
about 300 C. The hexahydrate is dimorphous, a tetragonal form 
being obtained by crystallization of a solution of the heptahydrate 
between 20°and 30 C, and a monoclinic form between 50 and 70 C. 
Nickel sulphate combines with many metallic sulphates to form 
double salts, and also forms addition compounds with ammonia 
aniline and hydroxylamine. The nitrate, Ni(NO*)j.6HjO, is obtained 
by dissolving the metal in dilute nitric acid and concentrating the 
solution between 40 and 50 C. It crystallizes in green prisms which 
deliquesce rapidly on exposure to moist air. 

Nickel carbonyl, Ni(C0)4, is obtained as a colourless mobile liquid 
by passing carbon monoxide over reduced nickel at a temperature 
of about 60 ° C. (L. Mond, Langer and Quincke, Jour, Chem. Soc, 
1890, 57, p. 749). It boils at 43^ C. (751 mm.), and sets at -25 C. 
to a mass of crystalline needles. It is readily soluble in hydrocarbon 
solvents, in chloroform and in alcohol. Its critical pressure is 
30 atmospheres and its critical temperature is in the neighbourhood 
of 195 C. (J. Dewar, Proc Roy. Soc, 1903, 71, p. 427). It decom- 
poses with explosive violence when heated rapidly. Dewar and 
Jones (Journ. Chem. Soc, 1904, p. 203) have made an exhaustive 
study of its^ reactions, and find that it is decomposed by the halogens 
(dissolved in carbon tetrachloride) with liberation of carbon mon- 
oxide and formation of a nickel halide. Cyanogen iodide and 
iodine mono- and tri-chloride effect similar decompositions with 
simultaneous liberation of iodine; sulphuric acid reacts slowly, 
forming nickel sulphate and liberating hydrogen and carbon mon- 
oxide. Hydrochloric and hydrobromic acids are without action; 
hydriodic acid only reacts slowly. With aromatic hydrocarbons in 
the presence of anhydrous aluminium chloride, in the cold, there is 
a largejsvolution of hydrochloric acid gas, and an aldehyde is formed ; 
at 100 C, on the other hand, anthracene derivatives are produced. 
Thus by using benzene, benzaldehyde and anthracene are obtained. 
Dewar and Jones suggest that in the latter reaction it is the 
metallic nickel which is probably the reducing agent effecting the 
change, since it is only dissolved in any quantity when the anthracene 
hydrocarbon is produced. When mesitylene is used, the reaction 
does not proceed beyond the aldehyde stage since hydrocarbon 
formation is prevented by the presence of a methyl group in the 
ortho-position to the -CHO group. Acids and alkalis are in general 
without action on nickel carbonyl. The vapour of nickel carbonyl 
burns with a luminous flame, a cold surface depressed in the flame 
being covered with a black deposit of nickel. Itis an extremely 
powerful poison. Mond and his assistants have discovered several 
other carbonyls. For example cobalt gives Co(CO)4, as orange 
crystals which melt at 51 , decomposing at a higher temperature, 
giving Co(CO)s and CO at 6o°; Co(CO)i forms jet black crystals. 
For iron carbonyls see Iron; also L. Mond, H. Hirtz and M. D. 
Cowap, Jour. Chem. Soc, 1910, 97, p. 798. Nickel carbonate^ NiCOi, 
is obtained in the anhydrous state by heating nickel chloride with 
calcium carbonate in a sealed tube to 150°^. (H. de S£narmont, Ann, 
Chim. Phys., 1850 [3], 30, 138). It crystallizes in microscopic rhombo- 
hedra insoluble in cold acids. By precipitation of nickel salts with 
solutions of the alkaline carbonates, basic carbonates of variable 
composition are obtained. 

Numerous determinations of the atomic weight of nickel have been 
metal the values 58-69 and 5870. 


NICKNAME, a name given to a person in addition to his 
personal names, Christian and surname, either as a playful or 
familiar form of address or as a mark of ridicule, contempt or 
hatred. The Middle English form of the word, nekename, shows 
that it is a corruption of "an ekename " {i.e. " added " name; 
eke, earlier eche, from the root seen in Lat. augere, Gr. av£avav), 
and is therefore equivalent to the Lat. agnomen.

NICOBAR ISLANDS, a British group of twelve inhabited and 
seven uninhabited islands in the Bay of Bengal, between Sumatra 
and the Andaman Islands, to which latter they are administra- 
tively appended. They have an aggregate area of about 635 . 
sq. m., Great Nicobar (Loong), the largest and southernmost 
of any size, covering 333 sq. m. Six others range in area from 
about 20 sq. m. to 62 sq. m.; the rest are mere islets. A careful 
census of the natives, taken by Mr E. H. Man in 1901, gave a 
total population of some 6700, at about which figure the estimates 
of the number of inhabitants have always stood. Car Nicobar 
(Pw), the most northerly island, with an area of 49 sq. m., was 
by far the most densely populated, and had 3500 inhabitants, ' 
Great Nicobar containing only 450. The marine surveys of 
these islands are still meagre and unsatisfactory, but the whole 
of the Nicobars and outlying islands were surveyed topographi- 
cally by the Indian Survey Department in 1886-1887, when a 
number of maps on the scale of 2 in. to the mile were produced, 
giving an accurate coast-line. Some of the islands have mere 
flat, coral-covered surfaces; others, again, are hilly, the Great 
Nicobar rising to 2105 ft. On that island there are considerable 
and beautiful streams, but the others generally are badly off 
for fresh surface water. There is one good harbour, a magnificent 
land-locked shelter called Nancowry Harbour, formed by the 
islands of Camorta and Nancowry (both known to natives as 
Nankauri), 

Geology. — The Nicobars form part of a great submarine chain, of 
which the Andamans are a continuation. Elaborate geological 
reports were issued by a Danish scientific expedition in i846*andan 
Austrian expedition in 1858. Dr Rink of the former found no trace 
of true volcanic rocks, though the chain as a whole is known for its 
volcanic activity, but features were not wanting to indicate con- 
siderable upheavals in the most recent periods. He considered that 
the islands belonged to the Tertiary age. Von Hochstetter of the 
Austrian expedition classified the most important formations thus: 
eruptive, serpentine and gabbro; marine deposits, probably late 
Tertiary, consisting of sandstones, slates, clay, marls, and plastic 
clay; recent corals. He considered the whole group connected 
geologically with the great islands of the Malay Archipelago farther 
south. The vexed question of the presenceof coal and tin in the 
Nicobars has so far received no decided scientific support. The white 
clay marls of Camorta and Nancowry have become famous as being 
true polycistinan marls like those of Barbados. Earthquakes ot 
great violence were recorded in 1847 and 1881 (with tidal wave), and 
mild shocks were experienced in December 1809. 

Meteorology. — It has always been held to be important to main- 
tain a meteorological station on the Nicobars, for the purpose of 
supplementing the information obtained from the Andamans regard- 
ing cyclones in the Bay of Bengal. From 1869 to 1888 an observatory 
was properly maintained in Nancowry harbour, but after the latter 
year observations were recorded only in a more or less desultory way 
until 1897, when the station was removed to Mus in Car Nicobar. 
The climate is unhealthy for Europeans. The islands are exposed 
to both monsoons, and smooth weather is only experienced from 
February to April, and in October. Rain falls throughout the year, 
generally in sharp, 'heavy showers. During the five years ending 
1888 the annual rainfall varied from 91 in. to 133 in., and the number 
of wet days per annum from 148 to 222. The highest temperature in 
the shade was 98*2° F., and the lowest 64 F. 

Flora and Fauna. — Although the vegetation of the Nicobars has 
received much desultory attention from scientific observers, it has 
not been subjected to a systematic examination by the 1 ndian Forest 
Department like that of the Andamans, and indeed the forests are 
quite inferior in economic value to those of the more northerly 
group; besides fruit trees — such as the coco-nut (Cocos nucifera), 
the betel-nut (Areca catechu), and the mellori (Pandanus leeram) — a 
thatching palm (Nipa fruticans) and various timber trees have some 
commercial value, but only one timber tree (Myristica irya )would be 
considered first -class in the Andamans. The palms of the Nicobars 
are, however, exceedingly graceful. Instances of the introduction 
of^ foreign economic plants are frequently mentioned in the old 
missionary records, and nowadays a number of familiar Asiatic 
fruit-trees are carefully and successfully cultivated. As with the 
geology and the flora, certain phases of the fauna of the islands 
havelieen extensively reported. The mammals are not numerous. 
In the southernmost islands are a small monkey, rats and mice, tree- 
shrews (Cladobates nic), bats, and flying- foxes, but it is doubtful 
if the " wild " pig is indigenous; cattle, when introduced and left, 
have speedily become " wild." There are many kinds of birds, 
notably the megapod (Megapodius nic), the edible-nest-building 
swift (Collocalia ntdifica), the hackled and pied pigeons (Calaenas 
nic. and Carpophaga bicotor), a paroquet (Palaeornis caniceps) and 
an oriole (Oriolus macrourus). Fowls, snipe and teal thrive after 
importation or migration. Reptiles — snakes, lizards and chame- 
leons, crocodiles, turtles and an enormous variant of the edible 
Indian crab — are numerous; butterflies and insects, the latter very 
troublesome, have not yet been systematically collected. The fresh- 
water fish are reported to be of the types found in Sumatra. 

Natives, — The Nicobarese may be best described as a Far 
Eastern race, having generally the characteristics of the less 
civilized tribes of the Malay Peninsula and the south-eastern 
portion of the Asiatic continent, and speaking varieties of the 
Mon-Annam group of languages, though the several dialects 
that prevail are mutually unintelligible. Their figure is not 
graceful, and, owing to their habit of dilating the lips by betel- 
chewing, the adults of both sexes are often repulsive in appear- 
ance. Though short according to the standard of whites (average 
height, man, 5 ft. si in.; woman, 5 ft.), the Nicobarese are a fine, 
well-developed race, and live to seventy or eighty years of age. 
Their mental capacity is considerable, though there is a great 
difference between the sluggish inhabitant of Great Nicobar and 
the keen trader of Car Nicobar. The religion is an undisguised 
animism, and all their frequent and elaborate ceremonies and 
festivals are aimed at exorcising and scaring spirits. Though 
for a long time they were callous wreckers and pirates, and cruel, 
and though they show great want of feeling in the " devil 
murders " — ceremonial murders of one of themselves for grave 
offences against the community, which are now being gradually 
put down — still on the whole the Nicobarese are a quiet, inoffen- 
sive people, friendly to each other, and not quarrelsome, and by 
inclination friendly and not dangerous to foreigners. The 
old charge of cannibalism may be generally said to be quite 
untrue. Tribes can hardly be distinguished, but there are dis- 
tinctions, chiefly territorial. All the differences observed in the 
several kinds of Nicobarese may with some confidence be referred 
to habitat and the physical difficulties of communication. Such 
government as there is, is by the village; but the village chiefs 
have not usually much power, though such authority as they 
have has always been maintained by the foreign Powers who have 
possessed the islands. The clothing, when not a caricature of 
European dress, is of the scantiest, and the waggling tags in 
which the loin-cloths are tied behind early gave rise to fanciful 
•stories that the inhabitants were naked and tailed. The houses 
are good, and often of considerable size. The natives are skilful 
with their lands, and though they never cultivate cereals, exercise 
some care and knowledge over the coco-nut and tobacco, and 
have had much success with the foreign fruits and vegetables 
introduced by the missionaries. The staple article of trade has 
always been the ubiquitous coco-nut, of which it is computed 
that 15 million are produced annually, 10 million being taken by 
the people, and 5 million exported about equally from Car 
Nicobar and the rest of the islands. The usual cheap European 
goods are imported, the foreign trade being carried on with the 
native traders of the neighbouring Asiatic countries. There is 
an old-established internal trade, chiefly between the older islands 
and Chowra, for pots (which are only made there) and racing 
and other canoes. 

History. — The situation of the Nicobars along the line of a very 
ancient trade route has caused them to be reported by traders 
and seafarers through all historical times. In the 17th century 
the islands began to attract the attention of missionaries. At 
various times France, Denmark, Austria and Great Britain all 
had more or less shadowy rights to the islands, the Danes being 
the most persistent in their efforts to occupy the group, until in 
1869 they relinquished their claims in favour of the British, who 
at once began to put down the piracies of the islanders, and 
established a penal settlement, numbering in all about 350 
persons, in Nancowry harbour. The health of the convicts was 
always bad, though it improved with length of residence and 
the adoption of better sanitary measures; and an attempt to 
found a Chinese colony having failed in 1884 through mis- 
management, the settlement was withdrawn in 1888. There are 
native agencies at Nancowry .harbour and on Car Nicobar, both 
of which places are gazetted ports. At the latter is a Church of 
England mission station under a native Indian catechist attached 
to the diocese of Rangoon.

NICOL, JAMES (1810-1879), Scottish geologist, was born at 
Traquair, near Innerleithen, in Peeblesshire, on the 12th of 
August 1 8 10. His father, the Rev. James Nicol (1 760-1819), 
was minister of Traquair, and acquired some celebrity as a 
poet. Educated at Edinburgh University (1825), James Nicol 
attended the lectures of Jameson, and thereby gained a keen 
interest in geology and mineralogy; and he pursued their study 
in the universities of Bonn and Berlin. After returning home 
he worked zealously at the local geology and obtained prizes 
from the Highland Society for essays on the geology of Peebles- 
shire and Roxburghshire; he subsequently extended his re- 
searches over various parts of Scotland, and in 1844 published 
his able Guide lo the Geology of Scotland. In 1847 he was ap- 
pointed assistant secretary to the Geological Society of London, 
in 1849 professor of geology in Queen's College, Cork, and in 
1853 professor of natural history in the University of Aberdeen, 
a post which he retained until a few months before he died, on 
the 8th of April 1879. During these years he carried out im- 
portant researches on the southern uplands of Scotland and on 
the structure of the Highlands. In the former region he gave 
the first clear account of the succession of the fossiliferous 
Lower Palaeozoic rocks (1848-1852) ; and when he came to deal 
with the still older Highland rocks he made out the position of 
the Torridon sandstone and Durness limestone and their re- 
lations to the schists and gneisses. His matured views, although 
contested by Murchison, have subsequently been substantiated 
by Professor C. Lapworth and others. 

The more important of his papers were: " On the Structure of the 
North-Western Highlands " {Quart. Journ. Geol. Soc. 9 1861), and " On 
the Geological Structure of the Southern Grampians " (ib. t 1863). 
He contributed the article " Mineralogy " to the ninth edition of the 
Encyclopedia Britannica. Among his other works were Manual of 
Mineralogy O849); Elements of Mineralogy (1858, 2nd ed., 1873); 
Geological Map of Scotland (1858); and Geology and Scenery of the 
North of Scotland (1866), 


NICOL, WILLIAM (? 1768-1851), Scottish physicist, was born 
about 1768, and died at Edinburgh on the 2nd of September 
1851. Nothing is known of his early history beyond the fact 
that, after amassing a small competence as a popular lecturer 
on natural philosophy, he settled in Edinburgh to live a very 
retired life in the society of his apparatus alone. Besides the 
invention of the prism known by his name (" A method of 
increasing the divergence of the two rays in calcareous spar, 
so as to produce a single image," New Edin.Journ., 1828), he 
devoted himself chiefly to the examination of fluid-filled cavities 
in crystals, and of the microscopic structure of various kinds of 
fossil wood. His skill as a working lapidary was very great; 
and he prepared a number of lenses of garnet and other precious 
stones, which he preferred to the achromatic microscopes of 
the time. 


NICOLAI, CHRISTOPH FRIEDRICH (1733-1811), German 
author and bookseller, was born on the 18th of March 1733 at 
Berlin, where his father, Christoph Gottlieb Nicolai (d. 1752), 
was the founder of the famous Nicolaische Buchhandlung. He 
received a good education, and in 1749 went to Frankfort-on- 
Oder to learn his father's business, finding time also to become 
acquainted with English literature. In 1752 he returned to Berlin, 
and began to take part in literary controversy by defending Milton 
against the attacks of J. C. Gottsched. His Briefe iiber den 
jetzigen Zustand der schonen Wissenschajlen in Deulschland, pub- 
lished anonymously in 1755 and reprinted by G. Ellinger in 1894, 
were directed against both Gottsched and Gottsched's Swiss 
opponents, Johann Jakob Bodmer and Johann Jakob Breitinger; 
his enthusiasm for English literature won for him the friendship 
of Lessing and Moses Mendelssohn. In association with Mendels- 
sohn he established in 1757 the Bibliothek der sckonen Wissen- 
schajlen, a periodical which he conducted until 1760. With 
Lessing and Mendelssohn Nicolai founded in 1759 the famous 
Briefe, die neueste Liter atur betrejfend; and from 1765 to 1792 
he edited the Allgemeine deutsche Bibliothek. This latter period- 
ical served as the organ of the so-called " popular philosophers," 
who warred against authority in religion and against what they 
conceived to be extravagance in literature. The new move- 
ment of ideas represented by Herder, Goethe, Schiller, Kant 
and Fichte, Nicolai was incapable of understanding, and he 
made himself ridiculous by foolish misrepresentation of the aims 
of these writers. Of Nicolai's independent works, perhaps the 
only one which has some historical value is his Anekdoten von 
Friedrich II. (1 788-1 792). His romances are forgotten, although 
Das Leben und die Meinungen des Herrn Magister Sebaldus 
Nothanker (1773-1776), and his satire on Goethe's Werther, 
Freuden des jungen Werthers (1775), had a certain reputation in 
their day. Between 1788 and 1796 Nicolai published in 12 vols, 
a Beschreibung einer Reise durch Deutschland und die Schweiz, 
which bears witness to the narrow conservatism of his views in 
later life. He died in Berlin on the nth of January 181 1. 

Nicolai's Bildniss und Setbstbiographie was published by M. S. 
Lowe in the Bildnissejetzt lebender Berliner Gelehrter, in 1806. See

NICOLAI, OTTO (1810-1849), German composer, was born on 
the 9th of June in Kbnigsberg. He studied music in Berlin and 
in 1833 became organist to the German embassy in Rome. 
There his operas Enrico II (1839) and II Templario (1840) 
were produced, besides some church music, a series of songs, and 
a number of compositions for the pianoforte. He was subse- 
quently appointed Hof Kapellmeister at the Berlin Opera House; 
and there, only two days before he died (on the nth of March 
1849), was performed his brilliant opera, The Merry Wives of 
Windsor, the work by which he is now remembered. 


NICOLAS, SIR NICHOLAS HARRIS (1799-1848), English 
antiquary, fourth son of John Harris Nicolas (d. 1844), was born 
at Dartmouth on the 10th of March 1799. Having served in the 
navy from 1812 to 1816, he studied law and was called to the bar 
at the Inner Temple in 1825. His work as a barrister, however, 
was confined principally to peerage cases before the House of 
Lords, and his time was mainly devoted to genealogical and his- 
torical studies. In 1831 he was made a knight of the order of 
the Guelphs, and in 1832 chancellor and knight-commander of 
the order of St Michael and St George, being advanced to the 
grade of the grand cross in 1840. He became a member of the 
council of the Society of Antiquaries in 1826, but soon began to 
criticize the management of the society's affairs, and withdrew 
in 1828. He then criticized the Record Commission, which he 
regarded as too expensive. These attacks, which brought him 
into controversy with Sir Francis Palgrave, led in 1836 to the 
appointment of a select committee to inquire into the public 
records. He was also responsible for several reforms at the 
British Museum. In 1822 Nicolas married Sarah (d. 1867), 
daughter of John Davison of Loughton, Essex, a reputed de- 
scendant of the Tudor statesman William Davison. By her he 
left two sons and six daughters. Pecuniary difficulties compelled 
him to leave England, and he died near Boulogne on the 3rd 
of August 1848. Although a sharp and eager controversialist 
Nicolas was a genial and generous man, with a great knowledge 
of genealogical questions. 

The most important of the works of Nicolas is his History of the 
Orders of Knighthood of Die British Empire; of the Order of the 
Guelphs; and of Medals, Clasps, &c, for Naval and Military Services 
(London, 1841-1842). Among his numerous other writings are, The 
Chronology of History (London, 1833); Life of William Davison 
(London, 1823) ; Synopsis of the Peerage of England (London, 1825) ; 
Life and Times of Sir Christopher Hatton (London, 1847); and an 
uncompleted History of the Royal Navy (London, 1847). He edited 
Proceedings and Ordinances of the Prtvy Council of England, 1386- 
1542 (London, 1 834-1837), and Despatches and Letters of Lord 
Nelson (London, 1844-1846) ; wrote lives of Chaucer, Burns, Cowper, 
Thomson, Collins, Kirke White and others for Pickering's Aldine 
edition of the poets; lives of Izaak Walton and Charles Cotton for an 
edition of the Compleat Angler; and several elaborate works on 
genealogical and kindred subjects printed for private circulation only. 


NICOLAUS DAMASCENUS, Greek historian and philosopher 
of Damascus, flourished in the time of Augustus and Herod the 
Great, with both of whom he was on terms of friendship. He 
instructed Herod in rhetoric and philosophy, and had attracted 
the notice of Augustus when he accompanied his patron on a 
visit to Rome. Later, when Herod's conduct aroused the sus- 
picions of Augustus, Nicolaus was sent on a mission to bring 
about a reconciliation. He survived Herod, and it was through 
his influence that the succession was secured for Archelaus; 
but the date of his death, like that of his birth, is unknown. 
Fragments of his universal history ('IoTopla Kaddkucfj), from the 
time of the Assyrian empire to his own days, his autobiography, 
and his life of Augustus (Bios Kaiaapos) have been preserved, 
chiefly in the extracts of Const antine Porphyrogenitus. Nicolaus 
also wrote comedies and tragedies, paraphrased and wrote com- 
mentaries on parts of Aristotle, and was himself the author of 
philosophical _ treatises.

account of his life and writings, and translation of the fragments. 


NICOLAUS OF LYRA (c. 1 265-1349), French commentator, 
was born in Lire, now Vieille-Lyre, in the department of Eure, 
Normandy. He entered the Franciscan order at Verneuil about 
1300, and studied at Paris, where, becoming a doctor some time 
before 1309, he taught for many years. From 1319 he was 
provincial of his order in France, and was present in that capacity 
at the general chapter at Perouse (1321). In 1325 he was 
provincial of Burgundy, and as executor of the estate of Jeanne 
of Burgundy, widow of King Philip VI., he founded the college 
of Burgundy at Paris, where he died in the autumn of 1349, 
being buried in the chapter hall of the convent of the Cordeliers. 
Among the authentic works of Nicolaus of Lyra are: (1) two 
commentaries on the whole Bible, one (Poslilla lilteralis, 1322- 
J^ 1 ) following the literal sense, the other (Poslilla mysiica 
sen morolis, 1339) following the mystic sense. There are 
numerous editions (Rome, 1 471-147 2; Douai, 1617; Antwerp, 
1634). (2) Tractatus de differentia noslrae Iranslationis (i.e. 
Vulgate) ab Hebraica verilate, 1333. (3) Two treatises against 
the Jews. (4) A theological treatise on the Beatific Vision* 
directed against pope John XXII. (1334), unpublished. (5) 
Contemplatio de vita S. Franctsci, a book of devotions. Nicolaus 
was above all a commentator. His exegesis, which was dominated 
by his polemics against the Jews, is characterized by a fidelity 
to the literal sense, the comparison with the Hebrew text, the 
direct use of Jewish commentators, a very independent attitude 
towards traditional interpretations, and a remarkable historical 
and critical sense. In all this he resembled Roger Bacon. His 
works, especially the PosHlla litteralis, were very popular in the 
14th and 15th centuries, but produced few imitators.

NICOLAY, the name of a French family of Vivarais which 
came rapidly into legal prominence at the end of the 15th century. 
Jean Nicolay (d. 1527), son of a bailli of Bourg Saint-Andeol, 
became councillor at the parlement of Toulouse and afterwards 
at the Grand Council, chancellor of the kingdom of Naples, 
Maitre des Requetes,and, finally, first president of theCbambre 
des Comptes of Paris (1506). This last post was filled continuously 
up to the Revolution by his descendants. Antoine Chretien 
de Nicolay (1712-1777) became marshal of France in 1775. 
His brother, Aymar Chretien Francois Michel (1721-1769), 
bishop of Verdun, was first almoner of Marie Josephe of Saxony, 
wife of the dauphin Louis (d. 1765), and her influential counsellor.

NICOLE, PIERRE (1625-1695), one of the most distinguished 
of the French Jansenists, was the son of a provincial barrister, 
and was born at Chartres. Sent to Paris in 1642 to study 
theology, he soon entered into relations with the Jansenist 
community at Port Royal (q.v.) through his aunt, Marie des 
Anges Suireau, who was for a short time abbess of the convent. 
Some scruple of conscience forbade him to proceed to the priest- 
hood, and he remained throughout life a " clerk in minor orders," 
although a profound theological scholar. For some years he 
was a master in the " little school " for boys established at 
Port Royal, and had the honour of teaching Greek to young 
Jean Racine, the future poet. But his chief duty was to act, 
in collaboration with Antoine Arnauld, as general editor of the 
controversial literature put forth by the Jansenists. He had a 
large share in collecting the materials for Pascal's Provincial 
Letters (1656); in 1658 he translated the Letters into Latin, under 
the pseudonym of Nicholas Wendrock. In 1664 he himself 
began a series of letters, Les Imaginaires, intended to show 
that the heretical opinions commonly ascribed to the Jansenists 
really existed only in the imagination of the Jesuits. His 
letters being violently attacked by Desmaretz de Saint-Sorlin, 
an erratic minor poet who professed great devotion to the 
Jesuits, Nicole replied to him in another series of letters, Les 
Visionnaires (1666). In the course of these he observed that 
poets and dramatists were no better than " public poisoners." 
This remark stung Racine to the quick; he turned not only 
on his old master, but on all Port Royal, in a scathing reply, 
which — as Boileau told him — did more honour to his head 
than to his heart. About the same time Nicole became involved 
in a controversy about transubstantiation with the Huguenot 
Claude; out of this grew a massive work, La Perpituiti de la 
foi de I'tglise catholique touchant V eucharistie (1669), the joint 
effort of Nicole and Antoine Arnauld. But Nicole's most 
popular production was his Essais de morale; a series of short 
discussions on practical Christianity. The first volume was 
published in 167 1, and was followed at irregular intervals by 
others; altogether the series numbers fourteen volumes. In 
1679, on the renewal of the persecution of the Jansenists, Nicole 
was forced to fly to Belgium in company with Arnauld. But 
the two soon parted. Nicole was elderly and in poor health; 
the life of a fugitive was not to his taste, and he complained that 
he wanted rest. " Rest," answered Arnauld, " when you have 
eternity to rest in!" In 1683 Nicole made a rather ambiguous 
peace with the authorities, and was allowed to come back to 
Paris. There he continued his literary labours up to the last; 
he was writing a refutation of the new heresy of the Quietists, 
when death overtook him on the 16th of November 1695. 

Nicole was one of the _ most _ attractive figures of Port Royal. 
Many^ stories are told of hip quaint absent-mindedness and unreadi- 
ness in conversation. His books are distinguished by exactly 
opposite qualities; they are neat and orderly to excess. Hence they 
were exceedingly popular with Mme de Sevign6 and readers of her 
class. No other Jansenist writer, not even Pascal, was so successful 
in putting the position of Port Royal before the world. And although 
a modern appetite quails before fourteen volumes on morality, there 
is much solid sense and practical knowledge of human nature to be 
found in the Essais de morale. Several abridgments of the work 
exist, notably a Choix des essais de morale de Nicole, ed. Silvestre de 
Saci (Paris, 1857). 

Nicole's life is told at length in the 4th volume of Sainte Beuve's 
Port-Royal. (St. C.) 


NICOLL, ROBERT (1814-1837), Scottish poet, was born 
on the 7th of January, 18 14, at the farm of Little Tullybeltane, 
in the parish of Auchtergaven, Perthshire. When Robert was 
five years old his father was reduced to poverty. He became 
a day-labourer, and was only able to give his son a very slight 
education. At sixteen the boy was apprenticed to a grocer and 
wine-merchant at Perth. In 1833 he began to contribute to 
Johnstone's Magazine (afterwards Tail's Magazine), and in 
the next year his apprenticeship was cancelled. He visited 
Edinburgh, and was kindly received there, but obtained no 
employment. He opened a circulating library at Dundee, 
but in 1836 he became editor of the Leeds Times. He held 
pronounced Radical opinions, and overtaxed his slender physical 
resources in electioneering work for Sir William Molesworth 
in the summer of 1837. He was obliged to resign his editorship, 
and died at the house of his friend William Tait, at Trinity, near 
Edinburgh, on the 7th of December 1837, in his twenty-fourth 
year. He had published a volume of Poems in 1835; and in 
1844 appeared a further volume. Poems and Lyrics, with an 
anonymous memoir of the author by Mrs C. I. Johnstone. 
The best of his lyrics are those written in the Scottish dialect. 
They are simple in feeling and expression, genuinefolk-songs. 

An eloquent appreciation of his character and his poetry was 
included in Charles Kingsley's article on " Burns and his School " in 
the North British Review for November 1851. See also P. R. 
Drummond, Life of Robert Nicoll, Poet (1884). 


NICOLL, SIR WILLIAM ROBERTSON (1851- ), Scottish 
Nonconformist divine and man of letters, was born at Auchindoir, 
Aberdeenshire, on the 10th of October 1851, the son of a Free 
Church minister. He graduated M.A. at Aberdeen in 1870, 
and studied for the ministry at the Free Church College there 
until 1874, when he was ordained minister of the Free Church 
at Dufftown. Three years later he moved to Kelso, and in 
1884 became editor of the Expositor. In 1886 he founded 
the British Weekly, a Nonconformist organ which obtained 
great influence over opinion in the free churches. Robertson 
Nicoll secured many writers of exceptional talent for his paper, 
to which he was himself a considerable contributor, the papers 
signed " Claudius Clear " being among those from his hand. 
He also founded and edited the Bookman (1891, &c), and acted 
as chief literary adviser to the publishing firm of Hodder & 
Stougbton. Among his other enterprises were The Expositor's 
Bible and The Theological Educator, He edited The Expositor's 
Greek Testament (1897, &c.),and aseriesof Contemporary Writers 
(1894, &c), and of Literary Lives (1904, &c). He wrote a history 
of The Victorian Era in English Literature, and edited, with 
T. J. Wise, Literary Anecdotes of the Nineteenth Century. The 
knighthood bestowed on him among the birthday honours in 
1909 was an apt recognition of his long and able devotion to 
the " journeyman work " of literature. 

A list of his publications is included in a monograph on Dr Nicoll 
by Jane T. Stoddart (" New Century Leaders," 1903). 


NICOLLS, RICHARD (1624-1672), American colonial governor, 
was born probably at Amp thill, Bedfordshire, England, in 1624. 
He commanded a royalist troop of horse during the Civil War, 
and on the defeat of the king went into exile. Soon after the 
Restoration he became groom of the bedchamber to the duke of 
York, through whose influence he was appointed in 1664 on a 
commission with Sir Robert Carr (d. 1667), George Cartwright 
and Samuel Maverick, to conquer New Netherland from the 
Dutch and to regulate the affairs of the New England colonies 
and settle disputes among them. The expedition set sail from 
Portsmouth on the 25th of May 1664, and New Amsterdam was 
surrendered to Nicolls on the 8th of September. Under authority 
of a commission from the duke of York, Nicolls assumed the 
position of deputy-governor of New Netherland (New York). His 
policy was vigorous but tactful, and the transition to the new 
regime was made smoothly and with due regard to the interests 
of the conquered people. They were guaranteed in the possession 
of their property rights, their laws of inheritance, and the enjoy- 
ment of religious freedom. The English system of law and 
administration was at once introduced into Long Island, Staten 
Island and Westchester, where the English element already 
predominated, but the change was made much more slowly in 
the Dutch sections. A code of laws, known as the " Duke's 
Laws," drafted by the governor with the help of his secretary, 
Matthias Nicolls 1 (c. 1630-1687), and dated the 12th of March, 
was proclaimed at Hempstead, Long Island, on the 1st of March 
1665 and continued in force until 1683; the code was compiled 
from the codes of the New England colonies, and it provided for 
trial by jury, for proportional taxation on property, for the 
issuance of new patents for land and for land tenure only by 
licence from the duke. Nicolls returned to England in the summer 
of 1668 and continued in the service of the duke of York. He 
was killed in the naval battle of Southwold Bay on the 28th of 
May 1672.

ed., 1872). For the " Duke's Laws " see Laws of Colonial New York,

NICOLSON, WILLIAM (1655-1727), English divine and 
antiquary, was educated at Queen's College, Oxford (M.A., 1679; 
fellow, 1679-1682). After visiting Leipzig to learn German he 
was made prebendary of Carlisle in 1681, archdeacon in 1682. 
Twenty years later he was appointed bishop of the same diocese, 
where he remained until his translation to Derry in 1718. In 
1727 he was nominated archbishop of Cashel and Emly, but died 
before he could assume charge. Nicolson is remembered by the 
impulsiveness of his temperament, which led him into a good 
deal of strife as a bishop, and more happily by his zeal in coDecting 
and guarding manuscripts and other official documents. For this 
purpose he had special rooms huilt at Derry. His chief works 
were the Historical Library (English, 1606-07-99; Scottish, 
1702; Irish, 1724; complete later editions, 1732 and i77 6 )> 
and Leges Marchiarum or Border Laws (1705, new ed., 1747). 


NICOMACHUS, a Neo-pythagorean philosopher and mathe- 
matician, born at Gerasa in Arabia Petraea, flourished about 
a.d. 100. In his musical treatise he mentions Thrasyllus (d. 36), 
the astrologer and confidant of Tiberius, and his Arithmetic was 
translated by Apuleius, who wrote under Antoninus Pius and 
Marcus Aurelius. He is the author of two extant treatises: 
(1) 'ApiBjxrjTiKrj el<xayor/7j (Introduction to Arithmetic), a meta- 
physical account of the theory and properties of numbers, and 
the first work in which arithmetic was treated quite independently 
of geometry. It was extremely popular, was the subject of 
commentaries by Iamblichus (ed. H. Pistelli, 1894) and others, 
was translated into Latin by Apuleius (according to Cassiodorus, 
the translation itself being lost) and Boetius, and used as a 
schoolbook down to the Renaissance. (2) 'Eyx^P^ ^ o.pfioviKrjs 
(Manual of Harmony), complete in one book, to which are 
erroneously appended as a second book some fragments probably 
belonging to a larger treatise On Music now lost. It is the oldest 
authority on the Pythagorean theory of music. Photius (cod. 
187) also mentions a work by Nicomachus called 'Apifl/iTjTiKa 

	1 Matthias may have been a cousin of Richard Nicolls ; his family 
	were of Islip, Oxford; he was secretary of the province, held 
	various judicial positions, and was mayor of New York City in 1672. 
	Matthias's son William (1657-1723), a lawyer, was a member of the, 
	New York Assembly from 1702 until his death and was speaker in' 
	1 702-1 71 8; he received a royal patent for what is now the town 
	of Islip on Long Island. Descendants of Richard and of Matthias 
	Nicolls spell the name " Nicoll." 

SeoKayoviieva (The Theotogy of Arithmetic), written in a spirit of 
Pythagorean mysticism and Oriental superstition, and setting 
forth the application of arithmetic, or rather of the first ten 
numbers, to the origin and attributes- of the gods. But the 
extracts in Photius are now generally attributed to Iamblichus. 
Other works of Nicomachus were: a Life of Pythagoras and a

NICOMACHUS, of Thebes, Greek painter, of the early part of 
the 4th century, was a contemporary of the greatest painters of 
Greece; Vitruvius observes that if his fame was less than theirs, it 
was the fault of fortune rather than of demerit. Pliny (xxxv. 108) 
gives a list of his works; among them a " Rape of Persephone," 
" Victory in a Quadriga," a group of Apollo and Artemis, and 
the " Mother of the Gods seated on a Lion." Pliny tells us that 
he was a very rapid worker and used hut four colours (the last 
seems impossible). Plutarch mentions his paintings as possessing 
the Homeric merit of ease and absence of effort. 


NICOMEDES I.» son of Zipoetes, king of Bithynia (c. 278- 
248 B.C.). He made himself master of the whole country and put 
to death his brother, who had set himself up as an independent 
ruler. He enlarged and consolidated the kingdom, founded the 
great city of Nicomedia as the capital, and fought successfully 
for some time with Antiochus of Syria. His reign seems to have 
been prosperous and uneventful; the year of his death is 
uncertain.

NICOMEDES II., Epiphanes, king of Bithynia, 140-91 B.C., 
fourth in descent from Nicomedes I., was the son of Prusias II. 
He was so popular with the people that his father sent him to 
Rome. Here he was so much favoured by the senate that Prusias 
sent an emissary to Rome with secret orders to assassinate him. 
But the emissary revealed the plot, and persuaded the prince to 
rebel against his father. Supported by At talus II., king of 
Pergamum, he was completely successful, and ordered his father 
to be put to death at Nicomedia. During his long reign Nico- 
medes adhered steadily to the Roman alliance, and assisted them 
against Aristonicus of Pergamum. He made himself for a time 
master of Paphlagonia, and in order to have a claim on Cappa- 
docia married Laodice (the widow of Ariarathes VI.), who had 
fled to him when Mithradates the Great endeavoured to annex 
the country. When her two sons died, Nicomedes brought 
forward an impostor as a claimant to the throne; but the plot 
was detected. The Romans refused to recognize the claim, and 
required Nicomedes to give up all pretensions to Cappadocia and 
to abandon Paphlagonia.

NICOMEDES III., Philopator, king of Bithynia, 91-74 B.C., 
was the son and successor of Nicomedes II. His brother Socrates, 
assisted by Mithradates, drove him out, but he was reinstated by 
the Romans (90). He was again expelled by Mithradates, who 
defeated him on. the river Amneus (or Amnias) in Paphlagonia. 
This led to the first Mithradatic War, as the result of which 
Nicomedes was again restored (84). At his death he bequeathed 
his kingdom to the Romans, a legacy which subsequently brought 
about the third Mithradatic War.

NICOMEDIA [mod. Ismid], an ancient town at the head of the 
Gulf of Astacus, which opens on the Propontis, was built in 264 
B.C. by Nicomedes I. of Bithynia, and has ever since been one 
of the chief towns in this part of Asia Minor. It was the metro- 
polis of Bithynia under the Roman empire (see Nicaea), and 
Diocletian made it the chief city of the East. Owing to its 
position at the convergence of the Asiatic roads to the new 
capital, Nicomedia retained its importance even after the 
foundation of Constantinople and its own capture by the Turks 
(1338).

NICOPOLIS, or Actia Nicopolis, an ancient city of Epirus, 
founded 31 B.C. by Octavian (Augustus) in memory of his victory 
over Antony and Cleopatra at Actium. The colony, composed 
of settlers from a great many of the towns of the neighbouring 
countries (Ambracia, Anactorium, Calydon, Argos Amphilo- 
chicum, Leucas, &c), proved highly successful, and the city 
was considered the capital of southern Epirus and Acamania, 
and obtained the right of sending five representatives to the 
Amphictyonic council. On the spot where Octavian's own tent 
had been pitched he erected a sanctuary to Neptune adorned 
with the beaks of the captured galleys; and in further cele- 
bration of his victory he instituted the so-called Actian games 
in honour of Apollo Actius. The city was restored by the 
emperor Julian, and again after the Gothic invasion by Justinian; 
but in the course of the middle ages it was supplanted by the 
town of Prevesa. The ruins of Nicopolis, now known as Palaeo- 
prevesa (Old Prevesa), lie about 3 m. north of that city, on a 
small bay of the Gulf of Arta (Sinus Ambracius) at the narrowest 
part of the isthmus of the peninsula which separates the gulf 
from the Ionian Sea. Besides the acropolis, the most conspicuous 
objects are two theatres (the larger with twenty-seven rows of 
seats) and an aqueduct which brought water to the town from 
a distance of 27 m. 

Nicopolis was also the name of (1) a city in Cappadocia in the 
valley of the Lycus, founded by Pompey on the spot where he 
defeated Mithradates; (2) a city in Egypt, founded by Octavian 
24 B.C. to commemorate his final victory over Antony; and (3) a city 
in Thrace (Nikup) at the junction of the Iatrus with t he _ Danube, 
founded by Trajan in memory of his victory over the Dacians. 


NICOSIA, the capital of Cyprus, situated in the north central 
part of the island. Pop. (1901) 14,752 (Moslem, 6013; Christian, 
8739). Its earliest name was Ledra, but Leucos, son of Ptolemy 
Soter (280 B.C.), is said to have restored it and changed its name 
to Leuteon, Leucotheon or Levcosia. A mile S.W. of the town 
lies the very large Bronze Age necropolis known as Hagia 
Paraskevi, which has been repeatedly explored with valuable 
results. The circuit of the city was reduced in 1567^ under the 
direction of the Venetian engineer G. Savorgnano, from 9 m. 
to 3 m.; eighty churches and a number of fine houses were 
sacrificed. The new walls were given a circular shape, with 
eleven bastions and three gates. Water is supplied by two 
aqueducts. Government House, the residence of the high 
commissioner, the government offices, hospital, central prison 
and the new English church are without the walls. The fosse 
has been planted, and part of it used as an experimental garden. 
Carriage roads have been completed to Kyrenia, Kythraia, 
Famagusta, Larnaca, Limasol and Morphou. The principal 
monuments of the Lusignan period are the fine cathedral church 
of St Sophia, an edifice of French Gothic, at once solid and 
elegant (the towers were never completed); the church of St 
Catherine, an excellent example of the last years of the 14th 
century (both these are now mosques); and the church of St 
Nicolas of the English (now a grain store), built for the order of 
the Knights of St Thomas of Acre. .A gateway of no great 
importance is nearly all that remains of the palace last used by 
the Venetian proweditori. It dates from the end of the 15th 
century. There is a museum, with a valuable catalogue. The 
chief industries are tanning and hand weaving, both silk and 
cotton. 


NICOSIA, a city and episcopal see (since 1816) of Sicily, in the 
province of Catania, 21 m. by road N. of the railway station of 
Leonforte (which is 49 m. W. of Catania) and 42 m. W.N.W. of 
Catania direct, 2840 ft. above sea-level. Pop. (1001) 16,004. 
The town retains a thoroughly medieval appearance, with a fine 
Norman cathedral and some other interesting churches, among 
them S. Maria Maggiore, with a reredos by Antonio Gagini. 

A Lombard dialect is still spoken here, and the town is less 
modernized in every respect than any other in Sicily. The Sicel 
town of Herbita is usually placed here, but without sufficient 
reason, and the origin of Nicosia is unknown. It was destroyed 
by the Saracens and repopulated by the Normans. 


NICOTERA, GIOVANNI (1828-1804), Italian patriot and 
politician, was born at San Biagio on the 9th of September 
1828. Joining the party of young Italy he was among the 
combatants at Naples in May 1848, and was at San Pancrazio 
with Garibaldi during the defence of Rome. After the fall of 
Rome he fled to Piedmont, where he organized the expedition 
to Sapri in 1857, but shortly after his arrival there he was 
defeated and severely wounded by the Bourbon troops. Con- 
demned to death, but reprieved through the intervention of 
the British minister, he remained a prisoner at Naples and at 
Favignana until i860, when he joined Garibaldi at Palermo. 
Sent by Garibaldi to Tuscany, he attempted to invade the Papal 
States with a volunteer brigade, but his followers were disarmed 
and disbanded by Ricasoli and Cavour. In 1862 he was with 
Garibaldi at Aspromonte; in 1866 he commanded a volunteer 
brigade against Austria; in 1867 he invaded the Papal States 
from the south, but the defeat of Garibaldi at Mentana put an 
end to his enterprise. His parliamentary career dates from i860. 
During the first ten years he engaged in violent opposition, but 
from 1870 onwards he joined in supporting the military reforms 
of Ricotti. Upon the advent of the Left in 1876, Nicotera 
became minister of the interior, and governed with remarkable 
firmness. He was obliged to resign in December 1877, when he 
joined Crispi, Cairoli, Zanardelli and Baccarini in forming the 
" pentarchy " in opposition to Depretis, but he only returned to 
power thirteen years later as minister of the interior in the 
Rudini cabinet of 1891. On this occasion he restored the system 
of uninominal constituencies, resisted the socialist agitation, 
and pressed, though in vain, for the adoption of drastic measures 
against the false bank-notes put in circulation by the Roman 
bank. He fell with the Rudini cabinet in May 1892, and died 
at Vico Equense, near Naples, on the 13th of June 1894.

NICOTINE, CioH 14 N 2 , an alkaloid, found with small quantities 
of nicotimine, C, 9 Hi 4 N2, nicoteine, Ci H 12 N 2 , and nicotelline, 
CioH 8 N 2 , in tobacco. The name is taken from Nicotiana, the 
tobacco plant, so called after Jean Nicot (1 530-1 600), French 
ambassador at Lisbon, who introduced tobacco into France in 
1560. These four alkaloids exist in combination in tobacco 
chiefly as malates and citrates. The alkaloid is obtained from 
an aqueous extract of tobacco by distillation with slaked lime, 
the distillate being acidified with oxalic acid, concentrated to a 
syrup and decomposed by potash. The free base is extracted 
by ether and fractionated in a current of hydrogen. It is a 
colourless oil, which boils at 247 C. (745 mm.), and when pure is 
almost odourless. It has a sharp burning taste, and is very 
poisonous. It is very hygroscopic, dissolves readily in water, 
and rapidly undergoes oxidation on exposure to air. The free 
alkaloid is strongly laevo-rotatory. F. Ratz (Monats., 1905, 26, 
p. 1 241) obtained the value [a] D = — 169-54° at 20 ; its salts are 
dextro-rotatory. It behaves as a di-acid as well as a di-tertiary 
base. 

On oxidation with chromic or nitric acids, or potassium per- 
manganate, it yields nicotinic acid or 0-pyridine carboxylic acid, 
Cfi^N-COaH; alkaline potassium ferricyanide gives nicotyrine, 
CioHioNj, and hydrogen peroxide oxy nicotine, CioHhNjO. Oxida- 
tion of its isomethylhydroxide with potassium permanganate yields 
trigonelline, C 7 H 7 NOi (A. Pictet and P. Genecjuand, Ber., 1897,30, 
p. 2117). It gives rise to various decomposition products such as 
pyridine, picoline, &c, when its vapour is passed through a red-hot 
tube. The hydrochloride on heating with hydrochloric acid gives 
methyl chloride (B. Blau, Ber., 1893, 26, p. 631). Hydriodic acid 
and phosphorus at high temperature give a dihydro-compound, 
whilst sodium and alcohol give hexa- and octo-hydro derivatives. 
Nicotine may be recognized by the addition of 'a drop of 30 % 
formaldehyde, the mixture being allowed to stand for one hour 
and the solid residue then moistened by a drop of concentrated 
sulphruic acid, when an intense rose-red colour is produced (1. 
Schindelmeiscr, Phartn. Zentralhalle, 1899, 40, p. 7°4)- 

The constitution of nicotine was established by A. Pinner (see 
papers in the Berichte, 1891 to 1895). With bromine in acetic acid 
solution at ordinary temperature, nicotine yields a perbromide, 
CioHioBr 2 N 2 0'HBr3 t which with sulphur dioxide, followed by 
potash, gives dibromcotinine, CioHioBr 2 N20, from which cotinine, 
C10H12N2O, is obtained by distillation over zinc dust. By heating 
nicotine with bromine in hydrobromic acid^ solution for some hours 
at 100 C, dibromticonine hydrobromide, GoHg^BraCVHBr, 
■ results. Dibromcotinine on hydrolysis yields oxalic acid, methy- 
lamine and |8-methyl pyridyl ketone: CioHioBr 2 N 2 0+3H20+0 = 
H2C20<+CH 3 NHs+C6H 4 N-CqCH 3 +2HBr; whilst dibromticonine 
yields methylamine, malonic acid and nicotinic acid : CioH 8 Br2N 2 02 + 
4H2O = CH3NH2+CH 2 (C02H) 2 +C6H 4 N-CO 2 H+2HBr, or if heated 
with zinc and caustic potash, methylamine and pyridyl-jfry-dioxy- 
butyric acid. Thus the groupings 

	0° 
	N 
	C— 
	— C-C— >N-CH 8 and— C-C-C- 

exist in the molecule, and the alkaloid is to be represented as 
tt-pyridyl-N-methyl-pyrollidine. 

This result has been confirmed by its synthesis by A. Pictet and 
P. Crepieux (Comptes rendus, 1903, 137, p. 860) and Pictet and 
Rotschy (Ber., 1904, 37, p. 1225): j8-aminopyridine is converted 
into its mucate, which by dry distillation gives N-0-pyridylpyrrol. 
By passing the vapour of this compound through a red-hot tube, 
it yields the isomeric a0-pyridylpyrrol, the potassium salt of which 
with methyl iodide gives a substance methylated both in the pyridine 
and pyrrol nuclei. By distillation over lime, the methyl group is 
removed from the pyridine ring, and the resulting a-pyridyl-N- 
methylpyrrol gives t-nicotine on reduction. This base is resolved into 
its active components by (/-tartaric acid, /-nicotine-^-tartrate 
crystallizing out first. The natural (laevo) base is twice as toxic as 
the dextro. The following formulae are important : —

	H S C CH 2 
	N-0-Pyridylpyrrol, a/3-pyridylpyrrol, nicotine. 

Acetyl and benzoyl derivatives of nicotine on hydrolysis do not 
yield nicotine, but an isomeric, inactive oily liquid (metanicotine). 
It is a secondary base, and boils at 275°-278 C. 

Nicotimine is a colourless liquid which boils at 25o°-255° C. Its 
aqueous solution is alkaline. Nicoteine is a liquid which boils at 
267 ° C. It is separated from the other alkaloids of the group by 
distilling off the nicotine and nicotimine in steam and then fraction- 
ating the residue, It is soluble in water and is very poisonous. 
Nicotelline crystallizes in needles which melt at 147 ° C. and is readily 
soluble in hot water. 

NICTHEROY, or Niteroy, a city of Brazil and capital of 
the state of Rio de Janeiro, on the E. shore of the Bay of Rio 
de Janeiro, opposite the city of that name. Pop. (1890) 34,269, 
(1900 estimate) 35,000. A railway connects the city with 
the interior — the old Cantagallo line, now a part of the Leo- 
poldina system, a branch of which runs north-eastward to 
Macah6, on the coast, and another northward from Nova 
Friburgo to a junction with the railway lines of Minas Geraes. 
Nictheroy is practically a residential suburb of Rio de Janeiro. 
It occupies, in great part, the low alluvial plain that skirts the 
shores of the bay and fills the valleys between numerous low 
wooded hills. The site is shut off from the sea coast by a range 
of high rugged mountains. The shore line of the bay is broken 
by large, deeply indented bays (that of Jurujuba being nearly 
surrounded by wooded hills), shallow curves and sharp pro- 
montories. Within these bays are beaches of white sand, called 
praias, such as the Praia da Icarahy, Praia das Flechas and 
Praia Grande, upon which face low tile-covered residences 
surrounded with gardens. The city consists of a number of 
these partially separated districts— Praia Grande, Sao Domingos, 
Icarahy, Jurujuba, Santa Rosa, Sao Lourenco, Ponta d'Areia 
and Barreto — all together covering 8 or 9 m. of the shore. 
An electric street railway connects all the outlying districts 
with the ferry stations of Praia Grande and Sao Domingos. 
The city is characteristically Portuguese in the construc- 
tion and style of its buildings— low, heavy walls of broken 
stone and mortar, plastered and coloured outside, with an 
occasional facing of glazed Lisbon tiles, and covered with 
red tiles. Among the public buildings are several churches 
and hospitals (including the Jurujuba yellow-fever hospital 
and the Barreto isolation hospital), the government palace, 
a municipal theatre and a large Salesian college situated in the 
suburbs of Santa Rosa on an eminence overlooking the lower 
bay. Several large islands fill the upper bay near the eastern 
shore; some are used as coal deposits for the great steamship 
companies, and one (Flores) is used as an immigrants' depdt. 
There is a small, rocky and picturesque island nearer the 
harbour entrance, which is crowned by a small chapel, dedicated 
to Nossa Senhora da Boa Viagem. Manufactures include 
cotton and woollen fabrics, tobacco, spirits, soap and tiles. 

The first settlement on the east side of the Bay of Rio de 
Janeiro dates from 167 1, when a chapel was erected at Praia 
Grande, in the vicinity of an Indian village. The settlement 
did not become a village until 1819, when it was named Villa 
Real da Praia Grande. In 1834 the city and municipal district 
of Rio de Janeiro was separated from the province, and Praia 
Grande became the capital of the latter in the following year. 
In 1836 it was raised to the dignity of a city and received the 
appropriate name of Nictheroy, from the Indian name Nyteroi, 
" hidden water." In the naval revolt of 1893-94 the older 
districts of the city suffered much damage from desultory 
bombardments, but the insurgents were too few to take possession. 
Soon afterwards the seat of government was removed to 
Petropolis, where it remained until 1903, when Nictheroy 
again became the capital of the state. 


NIDIFICATION (from Lat. nidus)) the process of making a 
nest (q.v.). Nidification is with most birds the beginning of'the 
breeding season, but with many it is a labour that is scamped 
if not shirked. Some of the auk tribe place their single egg on 
a bare ledge of rock, where its peculiar conical shape is but 
a precarious safeguard when rocked by the wind or stirred 
by the thronging crowd of its parents' fellows. The stone-curlew 
and the goatsucker deposit their eggs without the slightest 
preparation of the soil on which they rest; yet this is not done 
at haphazard, for no birds can be more constant in selecting, 
almost to an inch, the very same spot which year after year 
they choose for their procreant cradle. In marked contrast 
to such artless care stand the wonderful structures which others, 
such as the tailor-bird, the bottle-titmouse or the fantail-warbler, 
build for the comfort or safety of their young. But every variety 
of disposition may be found in the class. The apteryx seems 
to entrust its abnormally big egg to an excavation among the 
roots of a tree-fern; while a band of female ostriches scrape 
holes in the desert-sand and therein promiscuously drop their 
eggs and leave the task of incubation to the male. Some 
megapodes bury their eggs in sand, leaving them to come to 
maturity by the mere warmth of the ground, while others 
raise a huge hotbed of dead leaves wherein they deposit theirs/ 
and the young are hatched without further care on the part 
of either parent. Some of the grebes and rails seem to avail 
themselves in a less degree of the heat generated by vegetable 
decay and, dragging from the bottom or sides of the waters 
they frequent fragments of aquatic plants, form of them a rude 
half-floating mass which is piled on some growing water-weed — 
but these birds do not spurn the duties of maternity. 

Many of the gulls, sandpipers and plovers lay their eggs in a 
shallow pit which they hollow out in the soil, and then as incuba- 
tion proceeds add thereto a low breastwork of haulm. The 
ringed plover commonly places its eggs on shingle, which they 
so much resemble in colour, but when breeding on grassy uplands 
it paves the nest-hole with small stones. Pigeons mostly make 
an artless platform of sticks so loosely laid together that their 
pearly treasures maybe perceived from beneath by the inquisitive 
observer. The magpie, as though self-conscious that its own 
thieving habits may be imitated by its neighbours, surrounds 
its nest with a hedge of thorns. Very many birds of almost 
every group bore holes in some sandy cliff, and at the end of 
their tunnel deposit their eggs with or without bedding. Such 
bedding, too, is very various in character; thus, while the 
sheldduck and the sand-martin supply the softest of materials — 
the one of down from her own body, the other of feathers collected 
by dint of diligent search — the kingfisher forms a couch of the 
undigested spiny fish bones which she ejects in pellets from her 
own stomach. Other birds, such as the woodpeckers, hew holes 
in living trees, even when the timber is of considerable hardness, 
and therein establish their nursery. Some of the swifts secrete 
from their salivary glands a fluid which rapidly hardens as it 
dries on exposure to the air into a substance resembling isinglass, 
and thus furnish the " edible birds' nests " that are the delight 
of Chinese epicures. In the architecture of nearly all the 
passerine birds, too, some salivary secretion seems to play an 
important part. By its aid they are enabled to moisten and 
bend the otherwise refractory twigs and straws, and glue them 
to their place. Spiders' webs also are employed with great 
advantage for the purpose last mentioned, but perhaps chiefly 
to attach fragments of moss and lichen so as to render the whole 
structure less obvious to the eye of the spoiler. The tailor-bird 
deliberately spins a thread of cotton and therewith stitches 
together the edges of a pair of leaves to make a receptacle 
for its nest. Beautiful, too, is the felt fabricated of fur or hairs 
by the various species of titmouse, while many birds ingeniously 
weave into a compact mass both animal and vegetable fibres, 
forming an admirable non-conducting medium which guards 
the eggs from the extremes of temperature outside. Such a 
structure may be open and cup-shaped, supported from below 
as that of the chaffinch and goldfinch, domed like that of the 
wren and bottle-titmouse, slung hammock-wise as in the case 
of the golden-crested wren and the orioles, or suspended by a 
single cord as with certain grosbeaks and humming-birds. 

Certain warblers (Aedon and Thamnobia) invariably lay a 
piece of snake's slough in their nests — to repel, it has been 
suggested, marauding lizards who may thereby fear the neigh- 
bourhood of a deadly enemy. The clay-built edifices of the 
swallow and martin are known to everybody, and the nuthatch 
plasters up the gaping mouth of its nest-hole till only a postern 
large enough for entrance and exit, but easy of defence, is left. 
In South America the oven-birds (Furnariidae) construct on the 
branches of trees globular ovens, so to speak, of mud, wherein 
the eggs are laid and the young hatched. The flamingo erects 
in the marshes it frequents a mound of earth sometimes 2 ft. in 
height, with a cavity atop. The females of the hornbills submit 
to incarceration during this interesting period, the males im- 
muring them by a barrier of mud, leaving only a small window to 
admit air and food. 

But though in a general way the dictates of hereditary instinct 
are rigidly observed by birds, in many species a remarkable 
degree of elasticity is exhibited, or the rule of habit is rudely 
broken. Thus the falcon, whose ordinary eyry is on the beetling 
cliff, will for the convenience of procuring prey condescend to 
lay its eggs on the ground in a marsh, or appropriate the nest 
of some other bird in a tree. The golden eagle, too, remarkably 
adapts itself to circumstances, now rearing its young on a 
precipitous ledge, now on the arm of an ancient monarch of the 
forest and again on a treeless plain, making a humble home 
amid grass and herbage. Herons will breed according to circum- 
stances in an open fen, on sea-banks or (as is most usual) on lofty 
trees. Such changes are easy to understand. The instinct of 
finding food for the family is predominant, and where most food 
is there will the feeders be gathered together. This explains, in 
all likelihood, the associated bands of ospreys or fish-hawks, 
which in North America breed (or used to breed) in large 
companies where sustenance is plentiful, though in the Old 
World the same species brooks not the society of aught but its 
mate. Birds there are of eminently social predilections. In 
Europe,, apart from sea-fowls — whose congregations are universal 
and known to all — only the heron, the fieldfare and the rook 
habitually flock during the breeding season; but in other parts 
of the world many birds unite in company at that time, and in 
none possibly is this habit so strongly developed as in the anis 
of the neotropical region, the republican swallow of North 
America and the sociable grosbeak of South Africa, which last 
joins nest to nest until the tree is said to break down under the 
accumulated weight of the common edifice. 

In the strongest contrast to these amiable qualities is the 
parasitic nature of the cuckoos of the Old World and the cow- 
birds of the New. The egg of the parasite is introduced into the 
nest of the dupe, and after the necessary incubation by the fond 
fool of a foster-mother the interloper successfully counterfeits 
the heirs, who perish miserably, victims of his superior strength. 
The whole process has been often watched, but the reflective 
naturalist will pause to ask how such a state of things came 
about, and there is not much to satisfy his inquiry. Certain it 
is that some birds whether by mistake or stupidity do not 
infrequently lay their eggs in the nests of others. It is within the 
knowledge of many that pheasants' eggs and partridges' eggs 
are often laid in the same nest, and guDs' eggs have been found 
in the nests of eider-ducks and vice versa; a redstart and a pied 
flycatcher will lay their eggs in the same convenient hole — the 
forest being rather deficient in such accommodation; an owl 
and a duck will resort to the same nest-box, set up by a scheming 
woodsman for his own advantage; and the starling, which 
constantly dispossesses the green woodpecker, sometimes dis- 
covers that the rightful heir of the domicile has to be brought 
up by the intruding tenant. In all such cases it is not possible 
to say which species is so constituted as to obtain the mastery, 
but it is not difficult to conceive that in the course of ages that 
which was driven from its home might thrive through the foster- 
ing of its young by the invader, and thus the abandonment of 
domestic habits and duties might become a direct gain to the 
evicted householder. (A. N.) 

Nests and Coloration. — The correlation between nests and the 
coloration of the birds has been investigated by A. R. Wallace. 
Accordingly he divides birds into two main groups, first those in 
which the sexes are alike and of conspicuous or showy colours, 
and which nidificate in a covered site; secondly, those in which the 
males are showy and the females sombre, and which useopen sites 
for their nests. The many exceptions to these generalizations caused 
J. A. Allen (Bull. NutL Orn. Club, 1878) to write an adverse criticism. 
C. Dixon (H. Seebohm's Hist. Brit. Birds, ii., 1884, introduction) 
has reviewed the question from Wallace's point of view. He 
established the following categories. 

1 . Birds in which the plumage of the male is bright and conspicuous 
in colour, and that of the female dull and sombre, and which nidificate 
in open sites. In these very common cases, the female alone in- 
cubates, and obviously derives protection from its inconspicuous 
plumage. 

2. Birds in which the plumage of both sexes is showy or brilliant 
in colour, and which nidificate in open nests. This group forms one 
of those exceptions which at first sight appear seriously to affect the 
validity of Wallace's theory. In most of the cases, however, the 
birds, as, for instance, crows, gulls, herons, are either well able to 
defend themselves and their nests or, as, for instance, the sandpipers, 
they seek safety for themselves in flight, relying upon the protective 
tints of their eggs or young. - 

3. Birds in which the male is less brilliant than the female, and 
which nidificate in open nests. Such birds are exceedingly few, e.g. 
the Phalaropes, the common cassowary, the emu, a carrion hawk 
(Milvago leucurus) from the Falkland Islands, an Australian tree- 
creeper (Climacteris erythrops) and an Australian goatsucker (Eury- 
stopodus albigularis). In all these cases the male performs the duty 
of incubation. The male tinamous do the same, although they do 
not differ from their mates, but the conspicuously coloured male 
ostrich takes this duty upon himself during the night. 

4. Birds in which both sexes are brightly coloured, and which rear 
their young in holes or covered nests. For instance, the gaudy 
coloured rollers, bee-eaters, kingfishers, the hoopoe, hornbills, 
toucans, parrots, tits, the sheldrake and many others. 

5. Birds in which both sexes are dull in colour, and which build 
covered nests from motives of safety other than concealment. For 
example, the swifts (Cypselus), the sand-martin (Cotyle riparia), 
wrens, dippers and owls. 

6. Birds in which the female is duller in colour than the male, 
and which nidificate in covered nests; e.g. the redstart (Ruticilla 
phoenkura), the pied flycatcher (Muscicapa atricabiUa), rock- 
thrushes (Montkola), chats (Saxicola) and robin-chats (Thamnobia), 
and birds of the genus Malurus. In some of these cases the showy 
male bird assists in incubation, the kind of nest allowing him tq do 
so with safety. . 

Similar difficulties beset the generalizations concerning the 
correlation of the colour ot the eggs and the exposed or hidden 
condition of the nest. The eggs of most birds which breed in holes, 
or even in covered nests, are white, but the number of exceptions 
is so great that no general rule can be laid down to this effect. Con- 
versely the number of birds which lay purely white eggs in open 
nests, e.g. pigeons, is also large. The eggs of owls are always white, 
whether they be deposited in holes on the bare ground or in open 
nests in a tree. The eggs of the goshawk are white, but those of 
its small relation, the sparrowhawk, are always blotched, the nest of 
both being built precisely in the same kind of position, &e. In 
regard to the almost countless cases of shotted eggs in holes or covered 
nests, of which so many groups of birds furnish examples either 
wholly or in part, it has been suggested that the species in question 
has taken to hiding its eggs in times comparatively recent, and has 
not yet got rid of the ancestral habit of secreting and despositing 
pigment. 

Length of Time of Incubation. — Most of the smaller Passeres seem 
to hatch their young in from 13-15 days. The shortest period, only 
10 days, is recorded of the small Zosterops coerulescens ; the largest, 
amounting to about 8 weeks, is that of some of the larger Ratitae, 
penguins and the condor. The best list, comprising birds of most 
groups, is that by W. Evans {Ibis, 1891, pp. 52-93; and 1892, pp. 
55-58). Speaking broadly, the largest bircis lay the largest eggs and 
require the longest time for incubation, but there are very many 
exceptions, and only birds of the same group can be compared with 
each other. The domestic fowl takes 21 days, but the pheasant, 
though so very nearly allied, takes 2 or 3 days longer, and even the 
small partridge requires 24 days. The mallard takes 26, the domestic 
duck 27, the musk duck 35 days, like most of the swans. The cuckoo, 
with 13 to 14 days, seems to have adapted itself to the short period 
of its foster parents. 

The whole question still affords ample opportunities of experimental 
investigation and comparison. The condition of the newly hatched 
birds also varies extremely. The Nidifugae are born with their eyes 
open, are thinly clothed with neossoptiles of simple structure, leave 
the nest on the first day and feed themselves. The Nidicolae are 
born blind, remain a long time in the nest and have to be fed by their 
parents. Taken as a whole, the Nidifugae comprise most of the 
phylogenetieally older groups; but many of these may include some 
closely allied members which have reached the developmental level 
of the Nidicolae: for instance, some Aleidae, the pigeons, Sphenisei, 
Tubinares, Cieoniae. For detail see Birds : Classification. While in 
the first category the sense organs, tegumentary and locomotory 
organs are far advanced, these are retarded in the Nidicolae, the 
development of these structures being shifted on to the postembryonie 
period. Yet the length of the incubation is by no means always 
longer in the Nidifugae^ when compared with equal-sized Nidicolae.

NIEBUHR, BARTHOLD GEORG (1 776-1831), German states- 
man and historian, son of Karsten Niebuhr (q.v.), was born at 
Copenhagen on the 27th of August 1776. From the earliest age 
young Niebuhr manifested extraordinary precocity, and from 
1794 to 1796, being already a finished classical scholar and 
acquainted with several modern languages, he studied at the 
university of Kiel. After quitting the university he became 
private secretary to Count Schimmelmann, Danish minister of 
finance. But in 1798 he gave up this appointment and travelled 
in Great Britain, spending a year at Edinburgh studying agri- 
culture and physical science. In 1799 he returned to Denmark, 
where he entered the state service; in r8oo he married and 
settled at Copenhagen. In 1804 he became chief director of the 
National Bank, but in September 1806 quitted this for a similar 
appointment in Prussia. He arrived in Prussia on the eve of 
the catastrophe of Jena. He accompanied the fugitive govern- 
ment to Konigsberg, where he rendered considerable service 
in the commissariat, and was afterwards still more useful as 
commissioner of the national debt and by his opposition to ill- 
considered schemes of taxation. He was also for a short time 
Prussian minister in Holland, where he endeavoured without 
success to contract a loan. The extreme sensitiveness of his 
temperament, however, disqualified him for politics; he proved 
impracticable in his relations with Hardenberg and other ministers, 
and in 1810 retired for a time from public life, accepting the 
more congenial appointment of royal historiographer and 
professor at the university of Berlin. 

He commenced his lectures with a course on the history of 
Rome, which formed the basis of his great work Romische 
Geschichte. The first two volumes, based upon his lectures, 
were published in 1812, but attracted little attention at the time 
owing to the absorbing interest of political events. In 1813 
Niebuhr 's own attention was diverted from history by the 
uprising of the German people against Napoleon; he entered 
the Landwehr and ineffectually sought admission into the 
regular army. He edited for a short time a patriotic journal, 
the Prussian Correspondent joined the headquarters of the 
allied sovereigns, and witnessed the battle of Bautzen, and was 
subsequently employed in some minor negotiations. In 181 5 he 
lost both his father and his wife. He next accepted (1816) the 
post of ambassador at Rome, and on his way thither he discovered 
in the cathedral library of Verona the long-lost Institutes of 
Gaius, afterwards edited by Savigny, to whom he communicated 
the discovery under the impression that he had found a portion 
of Ulpian. During his residence in Rome Niebuhr discovered 
and published fragments of Cicero and Livy, aided Cardinal Mai 
in his edition of Cicero De Republica, and snared in framing the 
plan of the great work on the topography of ancient Rome by 
Christian C. J. von Bunsen and Ernst Platner (1 773-1 855), to 
which he contributed several chapters. He also, on a journey 
home from Italy, deciphered in a palimpsest at St Gall the frag- 
ments of Flavius Merobaudes, a Roman poet of the 5th century. 
In 1823 he resigned the embassy and established himself at Bonn, 
where the remainder of his life was spent, with the exception of 
some visits to Berlin as councillor of state. He here rewrote 
and republished (1827-1828) the first two volumes of his Roman 
History, and composed a third volume, bringing the narrative 
down to the end of the First Punic War, which, with the help of 
a fragment written in 181 1, was edited after his death (1832) 
by Johannes Classen (1805-1891). He also assisted in August 
Bekker's edition of the Byzantine historians, and delivered 
courses of lectures on ancient history, ethnography, geo- 
graphy, and on the French Revolution. In February 1830 his 
house was burned down, but the greater part of his books and 
manuscripts were saved. The revolution of July in the same year 
was a terrible blow to him, and filled him with the most dismal 
anticipations of the future of Europe. He died on the 2nd of 
January 1831. 

Niebuhr's Roman History counts among epoch-making histories 
both as marking an era in the study of its special subject and for 
its momentous influence on the general conception of history. 
" The main results," says Leonhard Schmitz, " arrived at by the 
inquiries of Niebuhr, such as his views of the ancient popula- 
tion of Rome, the origin of the plebs, the relation between the 
patricians and plebeians, the real nature of the ager publicus, and 
many other points of interest, have been acknowledged by all 
his successors." Other alleged discoveries, such as the con- 
struction of early Roman history out of still earlier ballads, 
have not been equally fortunate; but if every positive conclusion 
of Niebuhr's had been refuted, his claim to be considered the 
first who dealt with the ancient history of Rome in a scientific 
spirit would remain unimpaired, and the new principles intro- 
duced by him into historical research would lose nothing of their 
importance. He suggested, though he did not elaborate, the 
theory of the myth, so potent an instrument for good and ill in 
modernliistorical criticism. He brought in inference to supply 
the,- place of discredited tradition, and showed the possibility 
of' writing history in the absence of original records. By his 
theory of the disputes between the patricians and plebeians arising 
from original differences of race he drew attention to the immense 
importance of ethnological distinctions, and contributed to the 
revival of these divergences as factors in modern history. More 
than all, perhaps, since his conception of ancient Roman story 
made laws and manners of more account than shadowy lawgivers, 
he undesignedly influenced history by popularizing that con- 
ception of it which lays stress on institutions, tendencies and 
social traits to the neglect of individuals. 

Niebuhr's personal character was in most respects exceedingly 
attractive. His heart was kind and his affections were strong; 
he was magnanimous and disinterested, simple and honest. 
He had a kindling sympathy with everything lofty and generous, 
and framed his own conduct upon the highest principles. His 
chief defect was an over-sensitiveness, leading to peevish and 
unreasonable behaviour in his private and official relations, to 
hasty and unbalanced judgments of persons and things that had 
given him annoyance, and to a despondency and discouragement 
which frustrated the great good he might have effected as a philo- 
sophic critic of public affairs. 

The principal authority for Niebuhr's life is the Lebensnachrichten 
Hber B. G. Niebuhr, aus Briefen desselbcn und aus Erinnerungen 
einiger seiner nachstcn Freunde, by Dorothea Hensler (3 vols., 1838- 
1839). In the English translation by Miss Winkworth (1852) a. 
great deal of the correspondence is omitted, but the narrative^ is 
rendered more full, especially as concerns Niebuhr's participation 
in public affairs. It also contains interesting communications from 
Bunsen and Professor Loebell, and select translations from the 
Kleine Schriften. See also J. Classen, Barthold Georg Niebuhr, eine 
Geddchtnisschrift (1876), and G. Eyssenhardt, B. G. Niebuhr (1886). 
The first edition of his Roman History was translated into English 
by F. A. Walter (1827), but was immediately superseded by the 
translation of the second edition by Julius Hare and Connop Thirwall, 
completed by William Smith and Leonhard Schmitz (last edition, 
1 847-1851). The History has been discussed and criticized in a great 
number of publications, the most important of which, perhaps, is 
Sir George Cornwall Lewis's Essay on the Credibility 0} the Early 
Roman History. See further J. E. Sandys, History of Classical 
Scholarship (1908), iu\, pp. 78-82. 


NIEBUHR, KARSTEN (1733-1815), German traveller, was 
born at Ludingworth, Lauenburg, on the southern border of 
Holstein, on the 17th of March 1733, the son of a small farmer. 
He had little education, and for several years of his youth had 
to do the work of a peasant. His bent was towards mathematics, 
and he managed to obtain some lessons in surveying. It was 
while he was working at this subject that one of his teachers, in 
1760, proposed to him to join the expedition which was being sent 
out by Frederick V. of Denmark for the scientific exploration 
of Egypt, Arabia and Syria. To qualify himself for the work 
of surveyor and geographer, he studied hard at mathematics 
for a year and. a half before the expedition set out, and also 
managed to acquire some knowledge of Arabic. The expedition 
sailed in January 1761, and, landing at Alexandria, ascended the 
Nile. Proceeding to Suez, Niebuhr made a visit to Mount Sinai, 
and in October 1762 the expedition sailed from Suez to Jeddah, 
journeying thence overland to Mocha. Here in May 1763 the 
philologist of the expedition, van Haven, died, and was followed 
shortly after by the naturalist Forskal. Sana, the capital of 
Yemen, was visited, but the remaining members of the expedition 
suffered so much from the climate or from the mode of life that 
they returned to Mocha. Niebuhr seems to have saved his own 
life and restored his health by adopting the native habits as to 
dress and food. From Mocha the ship was taken to Bombay, 
the artist of the expedition dying on the passage, and the surgeon 
soon after landing. Niebuhr was now the only surviving member 
of the expedition. He stayed fourteen months at Bombay, and 
then returned home by Muscat, Bushire, Shiraz and Persepolis, 
visited the ruins of Babylon, and thence went to Bagdad, Mosul 
and Aleppo. After a visit to Cyprus he made a tour through 
Palestine, crossing Mount Taurus to Brussa, reaching Con- 
stantinople in February 1767 and Copenhagen in the following 
November. He married in 1 7 73, and for some years held a post in 
the Danish military service which enabled him to reside at 
Copenhagen. In 1778, however, he accepted a position in the 
civil service of Holstein, and went to reside at Meldorf, where he 
died on the 26th of April 1815. 

Niebuhr was an accurate and careful observer, had the in- 
stincts of the scholar, was animated by a high moral purpose, 
and was rigorously conscientious and anxiously truthful in 
recording the results of his observation. His works have long 
been classics on the geography, the people, the antiquities 
and the archaeology of much of the district of Arabia which he 
traversed. His first volume, Beschreibung von Arabien, was 
published at Copenhagen in 1772, the Danish government de- 
fraying the expenses of the abundant illustrations. This was 
followed in 17 74-1 7 78 by two other volumes, Reisebeschreibung 
von Arabien und anderen umliegenden Landern. The fourth 
volume was not published till 1837, long after his death, under 
the editorship of Niebuhr's daughter. He also undertook the 
task of bringing out the work of his friend Forskal, the naturalist 
of the expedition, under the titles of Descripliones animalium, 
Flora Aegyptiaco-Arabica, and Icones rerum naluralium (Copen- 
hagen, 1 775-1776). To a German periodical, the Deutsches 
Museum, Niebuhr contributed papers on the interior of Africa, 
the political and military condition of the Turkish empire, and 
other subjects. 

French and Dutch translations of his narratives were published 
during his lifetime, and a condensed English translation, by Robert 
Heron, of the first three volumes in Edinburgh (1792). His son 
Barthold (see above) published a short Life at Kief in 1817; an 
English version was issued in 1838 in the Lives of Eminent Men, 
published by the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge.

ploration " series) (1904). 


NIEDERBRONN, a town of Germany, in the imperial province 
Alsace-Lorraine, on the Falkensteiner Bach, situated under the 
eastern slope of the Vosges, 12 m. N.W. from Hagenau by rail. 
Pop. (1905) 3120. It contains an Evangelical and a Roman 
Catholic church, a convent of the Sisters of the Divine Redeemer, 
and a high-grade and other schools. Niederbronn is one of the 
best-known watering-places in the Vosges. Its brine springs, 
with a hydropathic establishment attached, are specific in cases 
of gout, obesity and liver disorders. Here, on the 26th of July 
1870, the first engagement between the Germans and the French 
in the Franco-German war took place. There are several ruined 
castles in the neighbourhood, the most noteworthy of which is one 
on the Wesenburg (141 5 ft. high) erected in the 14th century. 
Various Celtic and Roman antiquities have been found around 
Niederbronn.

NIEDERLAHNSTEIN, a town of Germany, in the Prussian 
province of Hesse-Nassau, situated on the right bank of the Rhine 
at the confluence of Lahn, 3 m. S.E. from Coblenz by the railway 
to Ems, and at the junction of lines to Hochheim and Cologne. 
Pop. (1905) 4351. It has two Roman Catholic churches. The 
chief industries are the making of machinery and shipbuilding. 
Niederlahnstein obtained civic rights in 1332, and was until 1803 
on the territory of the electors of Trier. Here on the 1st of 
January 1814 a part of the Russian army crossed the Rhine. 
In the vicinity are the Johanniskirche, a Romanesque church 
restored in 1857, and the Allerheiligenberg, whereon stands a 
chapel, once a famous place of pilgrimage. 


NIEDER-SELTERS, a village of Germany, in the Prussian 
province of Hesse-Nassau, situated in a well-wooded country on 
the Ems, 12 m. S.E. from Limburg by the railway to Frankfort- 
on-Main. Pop. (1900) 1339. Here are the springs of the famous 
Selters or Seltzer water, employed as specific in cases of catarrh 
of the respiratory organs, the stomach and bladder. Until 1866 
the springs belonged to the duke of Nassau; since this date they 
have been the property of Prussia. They became famous in the 
earlier part of the 19th century, although they had been known 
many years previously.

NIEDERWALD, a broad hill in Germany, in the Prussian 
province of Hesse-Nassau, on the right bank of the Rhine, 
between that river and the Wisper, opposite Bingen, forming 
the south-western apex of the Taunus range. Its summit is 
clothed with dense forests of oak and beech, while its southern 
and western sides, which descend sharply to Rudesheim and 
Assmannshausen on the Rhine, are covered with vineyards, and 
produce some of the finest wines of the district. At the edge of 
the forest, on the crest of the hill above Rudesheim, stands the 
gigantic " Germania " statue, the national monument of the war 
of 1870-71, which was unveiled on the 28th of September 1883 
by the emperor William I., in the presence of all the rulers in 
Germany or their representatives. It was designed by Johannes 
Schilling, and the bronze figure of Germania is 33 ft. high; the 
pedestal is adorned with allegorical figures and portraits of 
German princes and generals. Cogtooth mountain railways 
run up the hill from Rudesheim and Assmannshausen.

NIEHAUS, CHARLES HENRY (1855- ), American sculptor, 
of German parentage, was born at Cincinnati, Ohio, on the 24th 
of January 1855. He was a pupil of the McMichen School of 
Design, Cincinnati, and also studied at the Royal Academy, 
Munich, returning to America in 1881; in 1885, after several 
years in Rome, he established his studio in New York City. In 
1906 he became a National Academician. His principal works 
are: a statue of President Garfield, for Cincinnati; the Hahne- 
mann Memorial, in Washington; "Moses" and "Gibbons," 
for the Congressional Library, and " James A. Garfield," " John 
J. Ingalls," " William Allen," and " Oliver P. Morton," for 
Statuary Hall, Capitol, Washington; " Hooker " and " Daven- 
port," State House, Hartford, Connecticut; the Astor Memorial 
doors, Trinity Church, New York; " General Forrest," Memphis, 
Tennessee; Generals Sherman and Lee, and William the Silent; 
"The Scraper; or Greek Athlete using a Strigil"; statues of 
Lincoln, Farragut and McKinley, at Muskegon, Michigan; a 
statue of McKinley and a lunette for McKinley's tomb, at Canton, 
Ohio; and " The Driller," at Titusville, Pennsylvania, in memory 
of Colonel E. L. Drake, who, in 1859, sank the first oil well in 
Pennsylvania. 


NIEL, ADOLPHE (1802-1869), marshal of France, was born 
at Muret on the 4th of October 1802, and entered the ficole 
Polytechnique in 1821, whence he passed to the engineer school 
at Metz, becoming lieutenant in the Engineers in 1827 and 
captain in 1833. At the storming of Constantine he led the 
engineer detachment with one of the storming parties, and his 
conduct gained for him the rank of die} de bataillon (1837). 
In 1840 he was promoted lieutenant-colonel, and in 1846 colonel, 
and his next war service was as chief of staff to General Vaillant 
during the siege of Rome (1849), after which he was made general 
of brigade and director of engineer services at headquarters. 
In 1851 he became a member of the Committee of Fortifications, 
in the following year a member of the council of state, and in 
1853 general of division. In the first part of the Crimean War 
he was employed in the expedition to the Baltic, and directed 
engineer operations against Bomarsund, but early in 1855 he 
was sent to the Crimea, where he succeeded General Bizot as 
chief of engineers. For some years he had been the most trusted 
military adviser of Napoleon III., and he was now empowered to 
advise the generals on the spot in accordance with the wishes of 
the sovereign and the home government. This delicate and 
difficult task Niel managed to carry out with as much success 
as could be expected, and he had the credit of directing the siege 
operations against the Malakoff (see Crimean War). His 
reward was the grand cross of the Legion of Honour. From 1855 
to 1859 he was employed at headquarters, and also served in the 
senate. In the war against the Austrians in the latter year (see 
Italian Wars) Niel commanded the IV. corps, and took a 
brilliant part in the battles of Magenta and Solferino. On the 
field of battle of Solferino he was made a marshal of France. 
After service for some years in a home command, he became 
minister of war (1867). In this capacity he drafted and began 
to carry out a far-reaching scheme of army reform, based on 
universal service and the automatic creation of large reserves, 
which needed only time to mature. He also rearmed the whole 
of the army with the chassep6t rifle. But he did not live to 
complete the development of his system. He died on the 13th 
of August 1869 in Paris, and a year later the Franco-German War 
destroyed the old imperial army upon which the new formations 
were to have been grafted. 


NIELLO (the Italian form of Lat. nigelhim, diminutive of 
niger, " blacky Late Gr. ptKavdv), a method of producing 
delicate and minute decoration on a polished metal surface by 
incised lines filled in with a black metallic amalgam. In some 
cases it is very difficult to distinguish niello from black enamel; 
but the black substance differs from true enamel in being metallic, 
not vitreous. Our knowledge of the process and materials 
employed in niello-work is derived mainly from four writers, — 
Eraclius the Roman (a writer probably of the nth century), 
Theophilus the monk, who wrote in the 12th or 13th century, 1 
and, in the 16th century, Benvenuto Cellini 2 and Giorgio Vasari.* 
The design was cut with a sharp graving tool on the smooth 
surface of the metal, which was usually silver, but occasionally 
gold or even bronze. An alloy was formed of two parts silver, 
one- third copper and one-sixth lead; to this mixture, while 
fluid in the crucible, powdered sulphur in excess was added ; and 
the brittle amalgam, when cold, was finely pounded, and sealed 
up in large quills for future use. A solution of borax to act as a 
flux was brushed over the metal plate and thoroughly worked 
into its incised Lines. The powdered amalgam was then shaken 
out of the quills on to the plate, so as to completely cover all the 
engraved pattern. The plate was now carefully heated over a 
charcoal fire, fresh amalgam being added, as the powder fused, 
upon any defective places. When the powder had become 
thoroughly liquid, so as to fill all the lines, the plate was allowed 
to cool, and the whole surface was scraped, so as to remove the 
superfluous niello, leaving only what had sunk into and filled up 
the engraved pattern. Last of all the nielloed plate was very 
highly polished, till it presented the appearance of a smooth 
metal surface enriched with a delicate design in fine grey-black 
fines. This process was chiefly used for silver work, on account 
of the vivid contrast between the whiteness of the silver and the 
darkness of the niello. As the slightest scratch upon the metal 
received the niello, and became a distinct black line, ornament 
of the most minute and refined description could easily be pro- 
duced. 

The earliest specimens of niello belong to the Roman period. 
Two fine examples are in the British Museum. One is a bronze 
statuette of a Roman general, nearly 2 ft. high, found at Barking 
Hall in Suffolk. The dress and armour have patterns partly 
inlaid in silver and partly in niello. The dark tint of the bronze 
rather prevents the niello from showing out distinctly. This 
statuette is apparently a work of the 1st century. 4 The other 
example is not earlier than the 4th century. It is a silver casket 
or lady's toilet box, in which were found an ampulla and other 
small objects, enriched with niello-work. 6 

From Roman times till the end of the 16th century the art of 
working in niello seems to have been constantly practised in 
some part at least of Europe, while in Russia and India it has 
survived to the present day. From the 6th to the 12th century 
a large number of massive and splendid works in the precious 
metals were produced at Byzantium or under Byzantine influence, 
many of which were largely decorated with niello; the silver 
dome of the baldacchino over the high altar of S. Sophia was 
probably one of the most important of these. Niello is frequently 
mentioned in the inventories of the treasures belonging to the 
great basilicas of Rome and Byzantium. The Pala d'Oro at S. 
Mark's, Venice, 10th century, owes much of its refined beauty 
to niello patterns in the borders. This art was also practised by 
Bernward, artist-bishop of Hildesheim *{ob. 1023); a fine silver 
paten, decorated with figures in niello, attributed to his hand, 
still exists among the many rich treasures in the church of Han- 
over Palace. Other nielli, probably the work of the same bishop, 
are preserved in the cathedral of Hildesheim. In France, too, 
judging both from existing specimens of ecclesiastical plate and 
many records preserved in church inventories, this mode of 
decoration must have been frequently applied all through the 
middle ages: especially fine examples once existed at Notre 
Dame, Paris, and at Cluny, where the columns of the sanctuary 
were covered with plates of silver in the nth century, each plate 
being richly ornamented with designs in niello. Among the 
early Teutonic and Celtic races, especially from the 8th to the 
nth centuries, both in Britain and other countries, niello was

frequently used to decorate the very beautiful personal orna- 
ments of which so many specimens enrich the museums of Europe. 
The British Museum possesses a fine fibula of silver decorated 
with a simple pattern in niello and thin plates of repousse gold 
This, though very similar in design to many fibulae from Scandi- 
navia and Britain, was found in a tomb at Kerch (Panticapaeum). 
Several interesting gold rings of Saxon workmanship have been 
found at different times, on which the owner's name and orna- 
mental patterns are formed in gold with
a background of niello. One with the 
name of Ethelwulf, king of Wessex 
(836-838), is now m the British Museum 
(see figure). Another in the Victoria 
and Albert Museum has the name of 
Alhstan, who was bishop of Sherborne 
from 823 to 867. The metal-workers of 
Ireland, whose skill was quite unrivalled, 
practised largely the art of niello from 
the 10th to the 12th century, and pos- 
sibly even earlier. Fine croziers, shrines, 
fibulae, and other objects of Irish work- 
manship, most skilfully enriched with elaborate niello-work, 
exist in considerable numbers. From the 13th to the 16th 
century but little niello-work appears to have been produced in 
England. Two specimens have been found, one at Matlask, 
Norfolk, and the other at Devizes, which from the character of 
the design appear to be English. They are both of gold, and 
seem to be the covering plates of small pendant reliquaries 
about 1 in. long, dating about the end of the 15th century. One 
has a crucifix between St John the Baptist and a bishop; the other, 
that found at Devizes, has the two latter figures, but no crucifix. 1 
It is, however, in Italy that the art of niello- work was brought to 
greatest perfection. During the whole medieval period it was 
much used to decorate church plate, silver altar-frontals, and the 
like. The magnificent frontals of Pistoia cathedral and the 
Florence baptistery are notable instances of this. During the 
15th century, especially at Florence, the art of niello-work was 
practised by almost all the great artist-goldsmiths of that period. 
Apart from the beauty of the works they produced, this art had 
a special importance and interest from its having led the way to 
the invention of printing from engravings on metal plates (see 
Line-engraving). Vasari's account of this invention, given in 
his lives of Pollaiuolo and Maso Finiguerra, is very interesting, 
but he is wrong in asserting that Maso was the first worker in 
niello who took proofs or impressions of his plates. An important 
work of this sort, described at length by Vasari and wrongly 
ascribed by him to Maso Finiguerra (q.v.) f still exists in the 
Opera del Duomo at Florence. It is a pax with a very rich and 
delicate niello picture of the coronation of the Virgin; the 
composition is very full, and the work almost microscopic in 
minuteness; it was made in 1452. Impressions from it are 
preserved in the British Museum, the Louvre and other col- 
lections. The British Museum possesses the finest existing 
example of 15th-century German niello. It is a silver beaker, 
covered with graceful scroll-work, forming medallions, in 
which are figures of cupids employed in various occupations 
(see Shaw's Dresses and Decorations of the Middle Ages, 1858, 
vol. ii.).

NIEM [Nyem, or Nieheim], DIETRICH OF (c. 1345-1418), 
medieval historian, was born at Nieheim, a small town subject 
to the see of Paderborn. He became a notary of the papal court 
of the rota at Avignon, and in 1376 went with the Curia to Rome. 
Urban VI. here took particular notice of him, made him an 
abbreviator to the papal chancery, and in 1383 took him with him 
on his visit to King Charles at Naples, an expedition which led 
to many unpleasant adventures, from which he escaped in 1385 
by leaving the Curia. In 1387 he is again found among the 
abbreviators, and in 1395 Pope Boniface IX. appointed him to 
the bishopric of Verden. His attempt to take possession of the 
see, hcwever, met with successful opposition; and he had to 
resume his work in the chancery, where his name again appears in 
1403. In the meantime he had helped to found a German 
hospice in Rome, which survives as the Instituto dell' Anima, 
and had begun to write a chronicle, of which only fragments are 
extant. His chief importance, however, lies in the part he took 
in the controversies arising out of the Great Schism. He accom- 
panied Gregory XII. to Lucca in May 1408, and, having in vain 
tried to make the pope listen to counsels of moderation, he joined 
the Roman and Avignonese cardinals at Pisa. He adhered to the 
pope elected by the council of Pisa (Alexander V.) and to his 
successor John XXIII., resuming his place at the Curia. In view 
of the increasing confusion in the Church, however, he became 
one of the most ardent advocates of the appeal to a general 
council. He was present at the council of Constance as adviser 
to the German " nation." He died at Maastricht on the 22nd of 
March 14 18. 

Niem wrote about events in which he either had an intimate 
personal share or of which he was in an excellent position to obtain 
accurate information. His most important works are the Nemus 
unionis and the De schismate. Of these the first, compiled at Lucca 
after the breach with Gregory XII., is a collection of documents 
which had fallen into his hands during the negotiations for union : 
papal pronouncements, pamphlets, letters written and received by 
himself, and the like. The De schismate Hbri III. f completed on 
the 25th of May 1410, describes the history of events since 1376 
as Niem himself had seen them. It was continued in the Historic 
de vita Johannis XXIII. Other works are De bono regimine Rom. 
pontificis, dedicated to the new pope (John XXI II.); De modis 
uniendi ac reformandi ecclesiam and De aifjicultate reformations in 
concilio universalis advocating the convocation of a council, to which 
the pope is to bow; Contra dampnatos Wiclivitas Pragae, against the 
Hussites; Jura ac privilegia imperii, a glorification of the empire in 
view of the convocation of the council of Constance; Avisamenta 
pulcherrima de unione et reformatione membrorum et capitis fienda, a 
programme of church reform based on his experiences of the evils 
of the papal system.

NIEMCEWICZ, JULIAN URSIN (1758-1841), Polish scholar, 
poet and statesman, was born in 1757 in Lithuania. In the 
earlier part of his life he acted as adjutant to Kosciusko, was 
taken prisoner with him at the fatal battle of Maciejowice (1794), 
and shared his captivity at St Petersburg. On his release he 
travelled for some time in America, where he married. After 
the Congress of Vienna he was secretary of state and president 
of the constitutional committee in Poland, but in 1 830-1 831 he 
was again driven into exile. He died in Paris on the 21st of April 
1841. Niemcewicz tried many styles of composition. His 
comedy TJie Return of the Deputy (1790) enjoyed a great reputa- 
tion, and his novel, John of Tenczyn (1825), in the style of Scott, 
gives a vigorous picture of old Polish days. He also wrote a 
History of the Reign of Sigismund III. (3 vols., 1819), and a 
collection of memoirs for ancient Polish history (6 vols., 1822- 
1823). But he is now best remembered by his Historical Songs 
of the Poles (Warsaw, 1816), a series of lyrical compositions in 
which the chief heroes are of the golden age of Sigismund I., 
and the reigns of Stephen Bathori and Sobieski. 

His collected works were published in 12 vols, at Leipzig (1838- 
1840). 


NIENBURG ON THE SAALE, a town of Germany, in the duchy 
of Anhalt, situated at the influx of the Bode into the Saale, 
6 m. N. of Bernburg on the railway Calbe-Konnern. Pop. (1905) 
5748. It contains a beautiful Gothic Evangelical church, an 
old castle, once a monastery (founded 975, dissolved 1546), and 
now devoted to secular uses, and a classical school. The in- 
dustries embrace iron-founding and machine-making, malting 
and tanning. 


NIENBURG ON THE WESER, a town of Germany, in the 
Prussian province of Hanover, situated on the Weser, 33 m. 
N.W. from Hanover by the railway to Bremen. Pop. (1905) 
9638. It has an Evangelical and a Roman Catholic church, 
a classical school and an agricultural college. Its industries 
consist chiefly in glass-blowing, distilling, biscuit-making and 
the manufacture of manures. The towTi is mentioned as early 
as 1025. It was fortified in the 12th century, obtained municipal 
rights in 1569, and passed in 1582 to the house of Ltineburg. 
It was occupied by the imperialists from 1627 to 1634, and by 
the French during the Seven Years' War. The walls were dis- 
mantled by order of Napoleon I. in 1807.

NIEPCE, JOSEPH NICfiPHORE (1765-1833), French physicist, 
and one of the inventors of photography, was born at Chalon- 
sur-Saone on the 7th of March 1765. In 1792 he entered the 
army as a sub-lieutenant, and in the following year he saw active 
service in Italy. Ill-health and failing eyesight compelled him to 
resign his commission before he had risen above the rank of 
lieutenant; but in 1795 he was nominated administrateur of 
the district of Nice, and he held the post until 1801. Returning 
in that year to his birthplace, he devoted himself along with 
his elder brother Claude (1763-1828) to mechanical and chemical 
researches; and in 181 1 he directed his attention to the rising 
art of lithography. In 1813 the idea of obtaining sun pictures 
first suggested itself to him in this connexion; and in 1826 
he learned that L. J. M. Daguerre was working in the same direc- 
tion. In 1829 the two united their forces, " pour cooperer au 
perfectionnement de la decouverte inventee par M. Niepce 
et perfectionnee par M. Daguerre" (see also Photography). 
Niepce died at Gras, his property near Chalon, on the 3rd of 
July 1833. A nephew, Claude Felix Abel Niepce de Saint- 
Victor (180 5-1 870), served with distinction in the army, and 
also made important contributions towards the advancement 
of the art of photography; he published Recherches photo- 
grapkiques (Paris, 1855) and Traiti pratique de gravure hilio- 
graphique sur acier et sur verre (Paris, 1866). 


NIEREMBERG, JUAN EUSEBIO (1595-1658), Spanish 
Jesuit and mystic, was born at Madrid in 1595, joined the 
Society of Jesus in 1614, and subsequently became lecturer on 
Scripture at the Jesuit seminary in Madrid, where he died on 
the 7th of April 1658. He was highly esteemed in devout circles 
as the author of De la aficidn y amor de Jesus (1630), and De la 
aficidn y amor de Maria (1630), both of which were translated 
into Arabic, Flemish, French, German, Italian and Latin. 
These works, together with the Prodigios del amor divino (1641), 
are now forgotten, but Nieremberg's version (1656) of the 
Imitation is still a favourite, and his eloquent treatise, De la 
hermosura de Dios y su aviabilidad (1649), is the last classical 
manifestation of mysticism in Spanish literature. Nieremberg 
has not the enraptured vision of St Theresa, nor the philosophic 
significance of Luis de Le6n, and the unvarying sweetness of 
his style is cloying; but he has exaltation, unction, insight, 
and his book forms no unworthy close to a great literary 
tradition. 


NIERSTEIN, a village of Germany, in the grand duchy of 
Hesse-Darmstadt, on the left bank of the Rhine, 8 m. S. from 
Mainz by the railway to Worms. Pop. (1905) 4445. It contains 
a 'Roman Catholic and a Protestant church, an old Roman 
bath — Sironabad — and sulphur springs. It is famous for its 
wines, in which a large export trade is done. Nierstein was 
originally a Roman settlement, and was a royal residence under 
the Carolingian rulers. Later it passed from the emperor to 
the elector palatine of the Rhine. 


NIETZSCHE, FRIEDRICH WILHELM (1844-1900), German 
philosopher, was the son of the pastor at Rbcken, near Leipzig, 
where he was born on 15th October 1844. He was educated 
at Schulpforta, and studied the classics at the universities of 
Bonn and Leipzig. In 1869, while still an undergraduate, he 
was, on F. W. RitschTs recommendation, appointed to an extra- 
ordinary professorship of classical philology in the university 
of Basel, and rapidly promoted to an ordinary professorship. 
Here he almost immediately began a brilliant literary activity, 
which gradually assumed a more and more philosophical char- 
acter. In 1876 eye (and brain) trouble caused him to obtain 
sick leave, and finally, in 1879, to be pensioned. For the next 
ten years he lived in various health resorts, in considerable 
suffering (he declares that the year contained for him 200 days 
of pure pain), but dashing off, at high pressure, the brilliant 
essays on which his fame rests. Towards the end of 1888, after 
recovering from an earlier attack, he was pronounced hopelessly 
insane, and in this condition he remained until he died on the 
25th of August 1900. Nietzsche's writings must be understood 
in their relation to these circumstances of his life, and as the 
outcome of a violent revolt against them on the part of an 
intensely emotional and nervous temperament. His philosophy, 
consequently, is neither systematic in itself nor expounded in 
systematic form. It is made up of a number of points of view 
which successively appeared acceptable to a personality whose 
self-appreciation verges more and more upon the insane, and 
exhibits neither consecutiveness nor consistency. Its natural 
form is the aphorism, and to this and to its epigrammatic 
brilliance, vigour, and uncompromising revolt against all con- 
ventions in science and conduct it owes its persuasiveness. 
Revolt against the whole civilized environment in which he was 
brought up is the keynote of Nietzsche's literary career. His 
revolt against Christian faith and morals turns him into a proudly 
atheistic " free-thinker," and preacher of a new " master " 
morality, which transposes the current valuations, deposes 
the "Christian virtues," and incites the "over-man" ruthlessly 
to trample under foot the servile herd of the weak, degenerate 
and poor in spirit. His revolt against the theory of state 
supremacy turns him into an anarchist and individualist; his 
revolt against modern democracy into an aristocrat. His revolt 
against conventional culture leads him to attack D. F. Strauss 
as the typical "Philistine of culture"; his revolt against the 
fashion of pessimism to demand a new and more robust affirma- 
tion of life, not merely although, but because, it is painful. Indeed, 
his very love of life may itself be regarded as an indignant 
revolt against the toils that were inexorably closing in arouncl 
him. He directs this spirit of revolt also against the sources 
of bis own inspiration; he turns bitterly against Wagner, 
whose intimate friend and enthusiastic admirer he had been, 
and denounces him as the musician of decadent emotionalism; 
he rejects his " educator " Schopenhauer's pessimism, and 
transforms his will to live into a " Will to Power."] Nevertheless 
his reaction does not in this case really carry him beyond the 
ground of Schopenhauerian philosophy, and his own may 
perhaps be most truly regarded as the paradoxical development 
of an inverted Schopenhauerism. ] Other influences which may 
be traced in his writings are those of modern naturalism and of 
a somewhat misinterpreted Darwinism (" strength " is generally 
interpreted as physical endowment, but it has sometimes to 
be reluctantly acknowledged that the physically feeble, by their 
combination and cunning, prove stronger than the " strong "), 
His writings in their chronological order are as follows: Die 
Geburt der Tragodie aus dem Geiste der Musik (1872); UnzeiU 
gemdsse Betrachtungen (1873-1876) (Strauss — Vom Nutzen und 
Nachteil der Historie fiir das Leben — Schopenhauer als Erzieher — 
Richard Wagner in Bayreuth); Menschliches } Allzumenschliches 
(1876-1880); Morgenrbte (1881); Die jrohliche Wissenschafi 
(1882) ; Also sprach Zarathustra (1883-1884) ; Jenseits von 
Gut und Bdse (1886); Zur Genealogie der Moral (1887); Der 
Fall Wagner (1888); Gotzendammerung (1888); Nietzsche contra 
Wagner, Der Antichrist , and Poems first appeared in the complete 
edition of his works, which also contains the notes for Wille 
zur Macht, in which Nietzsche had intended to give a more 
systematic account of his doctrine (1895-1901). (F. C. S. S.) 
An edition of Nietzsche's complete works began to appear in 1895 ; 
there are also two popular editions, 1899 ff. (15 vols, have been pub- 
lished) and 1906 (10 vols.). In 1900 Nietzsche's Brief e began to be 
Eublished. An English translation in 18 vols., edited by Oskar 
evy, reached the 13th vol. in 1910. His biography, by his sister, 
Elisabeth Forster-Nietzsche (DasLeben Friedrich Nietzscties, 1895 ff.), 
reached its third volume in 1907. There are also lives by D. HaleVy 
(1909) and M. A. Miigge (F. Nietzsche: his Life and Work, 1908), 
the latter of a somewhatpopular character. G. Brandes first drew 
European attention to Nietzsche by his famous essay in 1889; since 
then an enormous literature has grown up round the subject. See 
especially L. Andreas Salome^ F. Nietzsche in seinen Werhen (1894); 
A. Riehl, F. Nietzsche (1897; 3rd ed., 1901); F. Tonnies, Nietzsche-

NIEUPORT (Flem. Nieuwpoort), a town of Belgium in the 
province of West Flanders. Pop. (1904) 3780. It was the 
port of Ypres, and is situated on the Yser about 10 m. S. of 
Ostend. It was strongly fortified in the middle ages and its siege 
by the French in ^88-1489 is : an episode* of its beroic period. 
Under its walls in 1600 Maurice of Nassau defeated the Archduke 
Albert and the Spaniards. It contains an ancient cloth market, 
a fine town-hall and an old church, and outside is a lighthouse 
dating from 1289. Nieuport Bains, 2 m. from the town, is a 
fashionable seaside resort dating only from 1869. It has a fine 
pier extending 1500 yds. out to sea and flanking the entrance 
to the Yser, which has been canalized. The bathing is excellent, 
and in the season the place is largely frequented by visitors. 


NIEVRE, a department of central France, formed from the 
old province of Nivernais with a small portion of the Orleanais. 
It is bounded N.W. by Loiret, N. by Yonne, E. by Cdte d'Or, 
E. and S.E. by Sa6ne-et-Loire, S. by Allier and W. by Cher. 
Pop. (1906) 313, 972. Area, 2659 sq. m. Nievre falls into three 
regions differing in elevation and in geological formation. In 
the east are the granitic mountains of the Morvan, one of the 
most picturesque portions of France, containing Mont Prenelay 
(2789 ft.) and several lesser heights. The north and centre are 
occupied by plateaus of Jurassic limestone with a maximum 
elevation of 1400 ft. The west and south-western part of the 
department is a district of plains, composed mainly of tertiary 
formations with alluvial deposits, and comprising the valleys 
of the Loire and the Allier, The lowest level of the department 
is 446 ft., at the exit of the Loire. Nievre belongs partly to the 
basin of the Loire, partly to that of the Seine. The watershed 
dividing these two basins follows the general slope of the depart- 
ment from S.E. to N.W.-— from Mont Prenelay to the Puisaye, 
the district in the extreme north-west. Towards the west the 
limits of Nievre are marked by the AlHer-Loire valley — the 
Loire striking across the south-west corner of the department 
by Decize "and Nevers and then continuing the line of its great 
affluent the Allier northwards by Fourchambault, La Charite, 
Pouilly and Cosne. Secondary feeders of the Loire are the 
Nievre, which gives its name to the department, and the Aron, 
whose valley is traversed by the Nivernais Canal. The largest 
tributary of the Seine in Nievre is the Yonne, which rises in 
the south-east, passes by Clamecy, and carries along with it 
the northern part of the Nivernais Canal. The Cure, the principal 
affluent of the Yonne (with which, however, it does not unite 
till after it has left tbe department), is the outlet of a lake, Lac 
des Settons, which serves as a reservoir for the regulation of 
the river and the canal. Owing to its greater elevation and the 
retention of the rain-water on its impermeable surface in the 
shape of ponds and streams, Morvan shows a mean temperature 
6° F. lower than that of the western district, which, in the valley 
of the Loire, is almost identical with that of Paris (52° F.). 
At Nevers the annual rainfall amounts to only 21 in., but 
in Morvan it is nearly three times as great. 

The principal cereals are oats and wheat; potatoes are 

	xix. 22 

also largely grown. Much land is given over to pasture and 
the cultivation of various kinds of forage, and the fattening 
of cattle is a thriving agricultural industry. The Nivernais 
and Charolais are the chief breeds. The rearing of sheep and 
draught-horses is also of importance. Vines are grown in the 
valley of the Loire and in the neighbourhood of Clamecy. The 
white wines of Pouilly on the Loire are widely known. Nievre 
abounds in forests, the chief trees being the oak, beech, hornbeam, 
elm and chestnut. Coal is mined at Decize, and gypsum, building 
stone, and kaolin are among the quarry products. The best- 
known mineral springs are those of Pougues and St Honore\ 
Of the iron-works for which Nievre is famous, the most important 
are those of Fourchambault. At Imphy there are large steel- 
works. The government works of La Chaussade at Guengny 
make chain-cables, anchors, armour-plates, &c. There are also ' 
manufactories of agricultural implements and hardware, potteries, 
manufactories of porcelain, and faience (at Nevers), tile-works, 
chemical works, paper-mills and saw-mills, as well as numerous 
tanneries, boot and shoe factories, cask manufactories and oil 
works (colza, poppy and hemp). In the Morvan district a large 
part of the population is engaged in the timber industry; the 
logs carried down by the streams to Clamecy are then put into 
boats and conveyed to Paris. 

A great deal of the traffic is by water: the canal along the 
left bank of the Loire runs through the department for $8 m., 
and the Nivernais canal for 78 m. The chief railway is that 
of the Paris-Lyons-Mediterrane'e Company, whose main line 
to Nimes follows the valley of the Loire and Allier throughout 
the department. Ni&vre is divided into 4 arrondissements 
(Nevers,Chateau-Chinon,Clamecy and Cosne being their capitals) , 
25 cantons, 313 communes. It forms the diocese of Nevers, 
and part of the educational district of Dijon and of the region 
of the VIII. corps d'armie. Its court of appeal is at Bourges. 
The most noteworthy towns are Nevers, the capital, Clamecy, 
Fourchambault, Cosne, La Charite and Decize. Varzy and 
Tannay have fine churches of the 14th, and the 12th, 13th and 
1 6th centuries respectively, and there is an interesting church, 
chiefly Romanesque in style, at St Pierre-le-Moutier. 


NIFO, AGOSTINO [Augustinus Niphus] (c. 1473-1538 or 
1545), Italian philosopher and commentator, was born at Japoli 
in Calabria. He settled for a time at Sezza and subsequently 
proceeded to Padua, where he studied philosophy. He lectured 
at Padua, Naples, Rome and Pisa, and won so high a reputation 
that he was deputed by Leo X. to defend the Catholic doctrine 
of Immortality against the attack of Pomponazzi and the 
Alexandrists. In return for this he was made Count Palatine, 
with the right to call himself by the name Medici. In his early 
thought he followed Averroes, but afterwards modified his 
views so far as to make himself acceptable to the orthodox 
Catholics. In 1495 he produced an edition of the works of 
Averroes; with a commentary compatible with his acquired 
orthodoxy. In the great controversy with the Alexandrists 
he opposed the theory of Pomponazzi that the rational soul 
is inseparably bound up with the material part of the individual, 
and hence that the death of the body carries with it the death 
of the soul. He insisted that the individual soul, as part of 
absolute intellect, is indestructible, and on the death of the 
body is merged in the eternal unity. 

His principal philosophical works are De immortalitate animi 
(1518 and 1524); De intellectu et daemonibus; De infinitate primi 
motoris quaestio and Opuscula moralia et politica. His numerous 
commentaries on Aristotle were widely read and frequently reprinted, 
the best-known edition being one printed at Paris in 1654 in fourteen 
volumes (including the Opuscula). 


NIGDEH (Arab. Nakidah), the chief town of a sanjak of the 
same name in the Konia vilayet of Asia Minor, situated on the 
Kaisarieh-Cilician Gates road. It is remarkahle for the beauty 
of its buildings, dating from almost all ages of the Seljuk period. 
After the fall of the sultanate of Rum (of which it had been 
one of the principal cities), Nigdeh became independent, and, 
according to Ibu Batuta, ruinous, and did not pass into Ottoman 
hands till the time of Mahommed II. It represents no classical 
town, but, with Bor, has inherited the importance of Tyana, 
whose site lies about 10 m. S.W. A Hittite-inscribedmonument, 
brought perhaps from Tyana, has been found at Nigdeh. The 
population (20,000) includes a large Greek and a small Armenian 
community. The Orthodox metropolitan of Iconium resides 
here. 


NIGEL (d. 1169), bishop of Ely, head of the exchequer in the 
reigns of Henry I. and Henry II., was brought into the exchequer 
in early life (1130). Soon after his uncle Roger of Salisbury 
secured him the bishopric of Ely, much to the disgust of the 
monks. Nigel was at first retained in Stephen's service; but, 
like his uncle and his brothers, incurred the suspicion of leaning 
towards the Angevin interest, when Roger of Salisbury and 
Alexander of Lincoln were arrested by Stephen (January 1139). 
Nigel attempted to maintain himself in his sec by force of arms, 
but he was forced to fly to the empress at Gloucester. He 
was reconciled to Stephen in 1142 and restored to his see; but 
he now became involved in a quarrel with the powerful Henry 
of Winchester. Ranulph, his first treasurer and representative 
at Ely, had been extortionate and dishonest, and the monks 
accused Nigel, probably with some justification, of spending 
the estates and treasures of the see in maintaining knights and 
gaining court influence. Henry of Winchester, who can have 
had little sympathy with bishops of Nigel's type, took up their 
quarrel, and Nigel was forced to go to Rome. Fortunately, 
both in these quarrels and in all his difficulties with Stephen, 
he secured the strong and uniform support of the Roman Curia. 
At the accession of Henry II. (ri54) Nigel was summoned to 
reorganize the exchequer. He was the only surviving minister 
of Henry I., and his knowledge of the exchequer business was 
unrivalled. This was the great work of his life. It is to the work 
of his son Richard, the Dialogus de Scaccario, that we are indebted 
for our knowledge of the procedure of the exchequer as it was 
left by Nigel. The bishop took little part in politics, except 
as an administrator. In 1 166 his health was broken by a paralytic 
seizure. Except for another quarrel with his monks, who 
accused him of despoiling their church and gained the ear of 
Pope Adrian, the last part of his life was laborious and uneventful.

NIGER, GAIUS PESCENNIUS, governor of Syria under the 
emperor Commodus. On the death of Pertinax (a.d. 193), 
he was saluted emperor by the troops at Antioch, but unaccount- 
ably delayed marching on Rome until he learned that Septimius 
Severus, one of the rival claimants, had assumed the offensive. 
He then strongly garrisoned Byzantium and the principal 
towns of Asia Minor, but after his legate Aemilianus had been 
defeated and slain near Cyzicus he himself was driven from 
Nicaea and routed near the Cilician Gates. Having failed in 
an effort to escape towards the Euphrates, he was brought back 
and put to death in 194.

NIGER, a great river of West Africa, inferior only to the 
Congo and Nile among the rivers of the continent, and the only 
river in Africa which, by means of its tributary the Benue, 
affords a waterway uninterrupted by rapids, and available 
for shallow-draught steamers, to the far interior. Rising within 
150 m. of the sea in the mountainous zone which marks the 
N.E. frontiers of Sierra Leone and French Guinea, it traverses 
the interior plateaus in a vast curve, flowing N.E., E. and S.E., 
until it finally enters the Gulf of Guinea through an immense 
delta. Its total length is about 2600 m. About 250 m. from 
its mouth it is joined by the Benue, coming from the east from 
the mountainous region of Adamawa. From its mouth to the 
limit of navigability from the sea the river is in British territory; 
above that point it flows through French territory. 

The source of the Niger lies in 9 5' N. and io° 47' W., and 
the most northerly point of the great bend is about 1 7 N. The 
area of the Niger basin, excluding the arid regions with a 
slope towards the stream, has been calculated by Dr. A. Bludau 
at 584,000 sq. m. The river is known locally under various 
names, the most common being Joliba (a Mandigo word meaning 
Great River) and Kworra or Quorra. ' By the last name the Niger 
was known in its lower reaches before its identity with the upper 
river was established. The stream considered the chief 
source of the Niger is called the Tembi. A narrow T £*/^J*" 
watershed separates it from the headwaters of the aw river. 
streams flowing south-west through Sierra Leone. The 
birthplace of the Niger is in a deep ravine 2800 ft. above sea- 
level. From a moss-covered rock a tiny spring issues and has 
made a pool below. This little stream is the Tembi, which 
within a short distance is joined by two other rivulets, the 
Tamincono and Falico, which have their origin in the same 
mountainous district. After flowing north for about 100 m., 
the river turns eastward and receives several tributaries from 
the south. At its confluence with the Tankisso (a northern* 
tributary), 210 m. from its source, the river has attained dimen- 
sions sufficient to earn for itself the title Joliba. Taking at 
this point a decided trend northward, the Niger, 100 m. lower 
down, at Bamako — the first considerable town on its banks — 
has a depth of 6 ft. with a breadth of 1300 ft. Seven or eight 
miles below Bamako the Sotuba rocks mark the end of what may 
be considered the upper river. From this point the navigable 
portion of the Niger begins. Thirty miles below Sotuba are the 
rapids of Tulimandio, but these are navigable when the river 
is at its highest, namely from July to October. A little lower 
down is Kulikoro, from which point the bed of the stream for 
over 1000 m. is fairly free from impediments. 

The river here turns more directly to the east and increases 
in volume and depth. At Sansandig the stream is deep enough 
to permit of steamers of considerable size plying upon 
the river. After Sansandig is passed the banks of Tfje 
the stream become low and the Niger is split up into middle 
a number of channels. Mopti is at the junction of Niger and 
the main stream with a large right-hand backwater ?jL* on 
or tributary, the Bani or Mahel Balevel, on which 
is situated the important town of Jenne. The banks of the 
Niger below Mopti become swampy and treeless, and the first 
of a series of lakes (Debo) is reached. These lakes are chiefly 
on the left of the main stream, with which they are connected 
by channels conveying the water in one direction or the other 
according to the season. At high water most of these are united 
into one general inundation. The largest lake, Faguibini, is 
nearly 70 m. long by 12 m. broad, has high shores and reaches 
a depth exceeding, in parts, 160 ft. It is not until Kabara, 
the port of Timbuktu, is reached, a distance of 450 m. from 
Sansandig, that the labyrinth of lakes, creeks and backwaters 
ceases. Below Kabara the river reaches its most northerly 
point. At Bamba it is shut in by steep banks and narrows 
to 600 to 700 yds., again spreading out some distance down. 
At Barka (200 m. from Timbuktu) the stream turns south-east 
and preserves that direction throughout the remainder of its 
course. At Tosaye, just before the bend becomes pronounced, 
the Baror and Chabar rocks reduce the width of the river to 
less than 500 ft., and at low water the strength of the current 
is a serious danger to navigation. Below Timbuktu for a con- 
siderable distance the Niger receives no tributaries ; from 
the north none until the region of the Sahara is passed. In 
places the desert approaches close to the river on both banks 
and immense sand dunes fill the horizon. 

At Ansongo, 430 m. below Timbuktu, the navigable reach 
of the middle Niger, in all 1057 m., ends. Four huge flint rocks 
bar the river at Ansongo and effectually prevent Bussa 
further navigation except in very small vessels. From rapids 
Ansongo to Say, some 250 m., the river flows through 
several rocky passes, the current attaining great 
velocity. Throughout this distance the river is a 
hopeless labyrinth of rocks, islands, reefs and rapids. From 
Say, where the stream is about 700 yds. in breadth, to Bussa, 
there is another navigable stretch of water extending 300 m. 
After the desert region is past the Niger receives the waters 
of the river Sokoto, a considerable stream flowing from the north- 
east. Some distance below this confluence are the Bussa rapids, 
which can only be navigated with considerable difficulty. These 

	lower river. 

rapids — though not such a hindrance to navigation — are of a 
more dangerous character than any encountered between Ansongo 
and Say. " In one pass, some 54 yds. wide, shut in between 
two large reefs, a good half of the waters of the Niger flings 
itself over with a tremendous roar " (Hourst). The rapids 
extend for 50 m. or more; in a less obstructive form they 
continue to Rabba, but light-draught steamers ascending the 
stream during flood season experience little difficulty in reaching 
Bussa. A little above Rabba the river makes a loop south-west, 
at the head of the loop being (right bank) Jebba. Here the 
river is bridged by the railway from Lagos. Sixty miles lower 
down is the mouth of the (left hand) tributary the Kaduna, a 
river of some magnitude which gives access to Zungeru, 
the headquarters of the British administration in Northern 
Nigeria. The head waters of the Kaduna are not far from Kano. 
Below the mouth of the Kaduna, on the right bank of the Niger, 
is Baro, the starting-point of a railway to Kano. In 7 50' N. 
6° 45' E. the Niger is joined by its great tributary the Benue. 
At their confluence the Niger is about three-quarters of a mile 
broad and the Benue rather more than a mile. The united stream 
forms a lake-like expansion about 2 m. in width, dotted with 
islands and sandbanks; the peninsula at the junction is low, 
swampy, and intersected by numerous channels. On the 
western bank of the Niger at this point is situated Lokoja 
(g.f.), an important commercial centre. The stream, as far 
south as Iddah (Ida), a town on the cast bank, rushes through 
a valley cut between the hills, the sandstone cliffs at some 
places rising 150 ft. high. Between Iddah and Onitsha, 80 m., 
the banks are lower and the country flatter, and to the south 
of Onitsha the whole land is laid under water during the annual 
The Delta ^ 00( ^ s * Here may be said to begin the great delta 
of the Niger, which, extending along the coast for 
about 120 m., and 140 or 150 m. inland, forms one of the most 
remarkable of all the swampy regions of Africa. The river 
breaks up into an intricate network of channels, dividing and 
subdividing, and intercrossing not only with each other but with 
the branches of other streams, so that it is exceedingly difficult 
to say where the Niger delta ends and another river system begins. 
The Rio Nun is a direct continuation of the line of the undivided 
river, and is thus the main mouth of the Niger. 

From the sea the only indication of a river mouth is a break 
in the dark green mangroves which here universally fringe 
the coast. The crossing of the bar requires considerable care, 
and at ebb tide the outward current runs 5^ knots per bour. 
For the first 20 m. (or as far as Sunday Island, the limit of the 
sea tide in the dry season) dense lines of mangroves 40, 50, or 
60 ft. in height shut in the channel; then palm and other trees 
begin to appear, and the widening river has regular banks. 
East of the Nun the estuaries known as the Brass, Sombrero, 
New Calabar, Bonny, Opcbo (or Imo), &c. (with the exception, 
perhaps, of the first-named), seem to derive most of their water 
from independent streams such as the Orashi, rising in about 
6° N., which is, however, linked with the Niger by the Onita 
Creek in 5§° N. Behind the town of Okrika, some 30 m. up 
the Bonny river, the swampy ground gives place to firm land, 
partially forest-clad. West of the Nun all the estuaries up to 
the Forcados seem to be true mouths of the great river, while 
the Benin river, though linked to the others by transverse 
channels, may be more properly regarded as an independent 
stream. (See Benin.) In this direction the largest mouth 
.is the Forcados, a noble stream with a safe and relatively deep 
bar. Its banks in its lower course are densely wooded, but the 
beach is sandy and almost free from marsh and malaria. The 
mouth is 2 m. wide. It has supplanted the Nun river as the 
chief channel of communication with the interior. There 
are 17 to 19 ft. of water over the Forcados bar, as against 13 ft. 
at the Nun mouth. Moreover the Forcados bar shifts little 
laterally, and within the bar is a natural harbour with an area 
of 3 to 4 sq. m. having a depth of 30 ft. at low water spring 
tides. From the mouth of the Forcados to the main stream 
is 105 m., with a minimum depth in the dry season of 7 ft. A 
northern arm affords ocean-going vessels access to Wari and 
Sapele. The other western mouths of the Niger have as a rule 
shallow and difficult bars. The delta is the largest in Africa 
and covers 14,000 sq. m. 

The Benue is by far the most important of the affluents of the Niger. 
The name signifies in the Batta tongue " Mother of Waters." The 
river rises in Adamawa in about 7 40' N. and 13 15' E. t The Benue 
a little north of the town of Ngaundere, at a height of 
over 3000 ft. above the sea, being separated by a narrow water 
parting from one of the head streams of the Logone, whose waters 
flow to Lake Chad. In its upper course the Benue is a mountain 
torrent falling over 2000 ft. in some 150 m. With the Chad system 
it is connected by the Kebbi or Mayo Kebbi, a right-hand tributary 
whose confluence is in about 9I N., 13$° E. The Kebbi, fed by many 
torrents rising in the eastern versant of the Mandara Hills, issues 
from the S.W. end of the Tuburi marshes. These marshes occupy 
an extensive depression in the moderately elevated plateau east of 
the Mandara Hills, and are cut byio°N., I5°E. The central part 
of the marshes forms a deep lake, whence there is a channel going 
northward to the Logone and navigable for some months during 
the year. The Kebbi flows west, and soon after leaving Tuburi 
passes through a rocky barrier marked by a series of rapids and a fall 
at Lata of 165 ft. Below these obstructions the Kebbi to its junction 
with the Benue has a depth of not less than 6 ft. In places, as at 
Lere and Bifara, it widens into lake-like dimensions. 

Below the Kebbi confluence the Benue, now a considerable river, 
turns from a northerly to a westerly direction and is navigable all 
the year round by boats drawing not more than 2 J ft. For some 
40 m. below the confluence the river has an average width of 180 to 
200 yds., and flows with a strong steady current, although a broad 
strip of count rv on each side is swampy or submerged. It is here 
joined by the faro, which, rising in the Adamawa Mountains S.E. 
of Ngaundere, flows almost due north. About 50 m. below the 
junction of the Faro is Yola, the capital of Adamawa. It lies on the 
southern side of the Benue, some 850 m. by river from the sea and 
at an altitude of 600 ft. Here the width of the stream increases at 
flood time to 1000 or 1500 yds., and though it narrows at the some- 
what dangerous rapids of Rumde Gilla to 150 or 180 yds., it soon 
expands again. About 50 m. below Yola the Benue receives, on the 
right bank, the Gongola, which rises in the Bauchi highlands and 
after a great curve north-east turns southward. It is oyer 300 m. 
long, and at flood time is navigable for about half of its course. 
The Benue receives several other tributaries both from the north and 
the south, but they are not of great importance. It flows onwards 
to the Niger with comparatively unobstructed current, its valleys 
marked for the most part by ranges of hills and its banks diversified 
with forests, villages and cultivated tracts. But though exception- 
ally free from obstruction by rapids, the river falls very low in the 
dry season, and for seven to eight months is almost useless for navi- 
gation. The Benue lies within British territory to a point 3 m. below 
the mouth of the Faro, in about 13 8' E. East of that point the 
river is in the German colony of Cameroon. 

As the Niger and the Benue have different gathering grounds, 
they are not in flood at the same time. The upper Niger rises in 
June as the result of the tropical rains, and decreases in FIood d 
December, its breadth at Turella expanding from between £™ 
2000 and 2500 ft. to not less than 1} m. The middle seasoaSt 
Niger, however, reaches its maximum near Timbuktu 
only in January; in February and March it sinks slowly above the 
narrows of Tosaye, and more rapidly below them, the level being 
?:ept up by supplies from backwaters and lakes; and by April 
there is a decrease of about 5 ft. In August the channel near Tim- 
buktu is again navigable owing to rain in the southern highlands. 
The Benue reaches its greatest height in August or September, 
begins to fall in October, falls rapidly in November and slowly in 
the next three months, and reaches its lowest in March and April, 
when it is fordable in many places, has no perceptible flow and at 
the confluence begins to Se covered with the water-weed Pistia 
Stratiotes. The flood rises with great rapidity, and reaches 50, 60, 
or even 75 ft. above the low-water mark. 

The two confluents being so unlike, the united river differs from 
each under the influence of the other. Here the river is at its lowest 
in April and Mav; in June it is subject to great fluctuations; about 
the middle of August it usually begins to rise; and its maximum is 
reached in September. In October it sinks, often rapidly. A slight 
rise in January, known as the yangbe, is occasioned by water from 
the upper Niger. Between high- and low-water mark the difference 
is as much as 35 ft. , . 

The geological changes which have taken palace in the Niger basin 
are imperfectly known. The French scientists E. F. Gautier and 
R. Chudeau, summing up the evidence available in 1909, 
set forth the hypothesis that the existing upper Niger aeoIoxfcaJ 
and the existing lower Niger were distinct streams. ^ M * 
According to this theory the upper Niger, somewhat above 
where Timbuktu now stands, went north and north-west and emptied 
into the Juf, which in the beginning of the quaternary age was a 
salt-water lake, the remnant of an arm of the sea which in the 
tertiary age covered the northern Sudan and southern Sahara as 
far east as Bilma. Lake Fagubini is regarded a3 a remnant of the 
ancient course of the upper river. When the upper Niger had this 
direction, the Wadi Taffassassent, now a dried-up riverof the central 
Sahara, which rose in the Ahaggar mountains, is believed to have 
formed the upper course of the existing lower Niger. While the 
upper and lower parts of the Niger have all the appearance of ancient 
streams, the middle Niger is the result of a ' recent" capture; 
"it has no past, it scarcely has a present " (see R. Chudeau, Sahara 
soudanais, Paris, 1909). 

Vague ideas of the existence of the river were possessed by 
the ancients. The great river flowing eastward reached by the 
Nasamonians as reported by Herodotus can be no 
History other than the Niger. Pliny mentions a river Nigris, 
phrltioa. of the same nature with the Nile, separating Africa 
and Ethiopia, and forming the boundary of Gaetulia; 
and it is not improbable that this is the modern Niger. In 
Ptolemy, too, appears along with Gir (possibly the Shari) a 
certain Nigir (NtY^ip) as one of the largest rivers of the interior ; 
but so vague is his description that it is impossible definitely 
to identify it with the Niger. 1 Arabian geographers, such as 
Ibn Batuta. who were acquainted with the middle course of 
the river, called it the Nile of the Negroes. At the same time 
contradictory opinions were held as to the course of the stream. 
It was supposed by some geographers to run west, an opinion 
probably first stated by Idrisi in the 12th century. Idrisi 
gave the Nile of Egypt and the Nile of the Negroes a common 
source in the Mountain of the Moon. Fountains from the 
mountain formed two lakes, whence issued streams which 
united in a very large lake. From this third lake issued two 
rivers — the Nile of Egypt flowing north, and that of the Negroes 
flowing west (see R. Dozy and M. J. de Goeje's Edrisi, Leiden, 
1866: Premier Climat, 1st 4 sections). From Idrisi's description 
it would appear that he regarded the Shari, Lake Chad, the 
Benue, Niger and Senegal as one great river which emptied 
into the Atlantic. 2 That the Niger flowed west and reached 
the ocean was also stated by Leo Africanus. The belief that a 
western branch of the Nile emptied itself into the Atlantic was 
held by Prince Henry of Portugal, who instructed the navigators 
he despatched to Guinea to look for the mouth of the river, 
and when in 1445 they entered the estuary of the Senegal the 
Portuguese were convinced that they had discovered the Nile 
of the Negroes (see Azurara's Discovery and Conquest of Guinea, 
Beazley and Prestage's translation, vol. ii., London, 1899, chaps. 
lx. and lxi., and introduction and notes). The Senegal being 
proved an independent river and the eastward flow of the 
Niger assumed, the theory that it ran into the Nile was revived, 
and almost to the very year in which the course of the river 
was actually demonstrated geographers and travellers, such 
as J. G. Jackson in his Empire of Marocco, first published in 
1809, fought zealously for the identity of the Nile of the Negroes 
with the river of Egypt. The highest scientific authority of the 
day, Major James Rennell, believed, however, that the Niger 
ended, by evaporation, in the country of " Wangara " — a region 
located by him, through a misreading of Idrisi, far too much 

	1 Sir Rufane Donkin in a curious and learned work, A Dissertation 
	on ... the Niger (1829), made the Niger join the Gir, which last 
	stream he calls the Nile of Bornu. The united river ran north, 
	disappeared underground in the Sahara and reached the Mediter- 
	ranean at " the quicksands of the gulph of Sidra." Donkin believed 
	that the desert, advancing eastwards, would overwhelm the Egyptian 
	Nile also in its lower course. " The Delta," he exclaims, u shall 
	become a plashy quicksand, a second Syrtis ! and the Nile shall 
	cease to exist from the Lower Cataract downwards." 

	2 The hydrography of northern central Africa as now known 
	largely explains the medieval belief in a connexion between the 
	western rivers and the Egyptian Nile. Leaving out of account the 
	Welle-Ubangi (and Idrisi's description of the two Niles may infer a 
	knowledge of that stream, which was supposed by Schweinfurth to 
	form part of the Chad system), there is an almost continuous water- 
	way from the mouth of the Senegal to that of the Nile. The upper 
	waters of the Bakoy branch of the Senegal and those of the navigable 
	Niger are less than 40 m. apart; the Niger communicates directly 
	through the Benue, Lake Tuburi and the Logone with the Shari; 
	the easternmost affluents of the Shari and the most western tribu- 
	taries of the Bahr el Ghazel affluent of the Nile are within 20 m. 
	of one another. With but three short porterages a boat could be 
	navigated the whole of this distance. Moreover, from the confluence 
	of the Ghazel the Nile is navigable (at high water) the entire distance 
	to the Mediterranean. (See also Shari.) 

to the east, between 15° and 20 E. (see Rennell's map in Horne- 
mann's Travels, 1802). To Rennell the Benue was an east- 
flowing continuation of the Niger. 8 The imagined existence 
of mountains — called Kong in the west and Komri (Lunar) in the 
east — stretching in a high and unbroken chain across Africa 
about io° N. long prevented geographers from thinking of a 
possible southern bend to the Niger.

the Nun was the chief, known as the Oil Rivers, formed the delta 
of the Niger does not appear to have been suspected before the 
beginning of the 19th century. Consequently it was from the 
direction of its source that the river was first explored in modern 
times. In 1795 Mungo Park (q.v.) was sent out by the African 
Association, and was the first European to see and describe 
the upper river. Park landed at the Gambia, and struck the 
Niger near Segu (a town some distance above Sansandig) on the 
20th of July 1796, where he beheld it " glittering in the morning 
sun as broad as the Thames at Westminster and flowing slowly to 
the eastward " (Travels, 1st ed. p. 194). He descended the 
river some distance, and on his return journey went up stream 
as far as Bamako. In 1805 Park returned to Africa for the 
purpose of descending the Niger to its mouth. He started as 
before from the Gambia, reached the Niger, sailed down the 
river past Timbuktu, and on the eve of the successful accomplish- 
ment of his undertaking lost his life during an attack on his boat 
by the natives at Bussa (Nov. or Dec. 1805). Park held to the 
opinion that the Niger and Congo were one river, though in 1802 
C. G. Reichard, a German geographer, had suggested that the 
Rio Nun was the mouth of the Niger. 4 Owing to Park's death the 
results of his second journey were lost, and the work had to be 
begun afresh. In 1822 Major A. G. Laing (who had reached 
Timbuktu by way of Tripoli) obtained some accurate information 
concerning the sources of the river, and in 1828 the French 
explorer Rene Caillie went by boat from Jenne to the port of 
Timbuktu. In 1826 Bussa was reached from Benin by Hugh 
Clapperton, and his servant Richard Lander. On Clapperton's 
death Richard Lander and his brother John led in 1830 an 
expedition .which went overland from Badagry to the Niger. 
Canoeing down the river from Yawri — 60 m. above Bussa — to 
the mouth of the Rio Nun they finally settled the doubt as to the 
lower course of the stream. In 1832 Macgregor Laird established 
the African Steamship Company, and Richard Lander and 
R. A. K. Oldfield (as members of its first expedition) ascended 
the Niger to Rabba, and the Benue as far as Dagbo (80 m.). 
In 1 841 an expedition, consisting of three steamers of the British 
navy, under Captain (afterwards Admiral) H. D. Trotter, went 
up to Egga (Egam), but was forced to return owing to sickness 
and mortality. 

Heinrich Barth (1851-1854) made known to Europe the 
course of the river from Timbuktu to Say. Barth sailed down 
from Saraiyamo (situated on a tributary stream south-west of 
Timbukutu) to Kabara; then skirted the left bank to a small 
town called Bornu in 16 N., and the right thence to Say. In 
1 880-1 88 1 the German E. R. Flegel ascended the Niger to 
Gomba opposite the confluence of the Sokoto river with the 
main stream, and about 70 m. below Barth's southmost point. 
Zweifel and Moustier, sent out by M. Verminck, a Marseilles 
merchant, discovered (1879) the sources of the Falico, &c, and 
in 1885 the Tembi source was visited by Captain Brouet, a French 
officer. Indeed the additions to the knowledge of the Niger 
during the last two decades of the 19th century were largely 
the work of French officers engaged in the extension of French 
influence throughout the western Sudan. From 1880 onwards 
Colonel (afterward General) Gallieni took a leading part in the 
operations on the upper river, where in 1883 a small gunboat, the 
Niger, was launched for the protection of the newly established 
French posts. In 1885 a voyage was made by Captain Delanneau 

	1 In 1816 James McQueen correctly divined that there was a 
	^reat west-flowing tributary (the Benue) to the Niger, and that after 
	its confluence the river ran south to the Atlantic. See his View of 
	Northern Central Africa (1821) and Geographical Survey of Africa 
	(1840). 

	2 See EphimSrides gSographiques, vol. xii. (Weimar, Aug. 1803). 

past the ruins of Sansandig, as far as Diafarabe. In 1887 the 
gunboat made a more extended voyage, reaching the port of 
Timbuktu, and correcting the mapping of the river down to that 
point. In 1894-1895 attention was directed to the middle and 
lower Niger, to which several expeditions started from the coast 
of Guinea. A still more important expedition was that of 
Lieutenant Hourst, who, starting from Timbuktu in January 
1896, navigated the Niger from that point to its mouth, executing 
a careful survey of the river and the various obstructions to 
navigation. A voyage made in 1897 by Lieutenant de Chevigne* 
showed that at low water the section between Timbuktu and 
Ansongo presents great difficulties, but the voyage from 
Timbuktu to Say was again successfully accomplished in 1899 
by Captain Granderye. In 1901 Captain E. Lenfant ascended 
the river with a flotilla from its mouth to Say, and he demon- 
strated the " normal practicability " of the route, despite the 
Bussa rapids. The delta of the Niger has been partially surveyed 
since it became British territory by various ship captains, 
officials of the Royal Niger Company and others, including Sir 
Harry Johnston, sometime British consul for the Oil Rivers. 

In addition to the main stream,' the Niger basin was made 
known by exploration during the last quarter of the 19th century 
and the early years of the 20th. The journeys of the German 
traveller G. A. Krause (north from the Gold Coast, 1886-1887) 
and the French Captain fiinger (Senegal to Ivory Coast, 1887- 
1889) first defined its southern limits by revealing the unexpected 
northward extension of the basins of the Guinea coast streams, 
especially the Volta and Komoe, a fact which explained the 
absence of important tributaries within the Niger bend. This 
was crossed for the first time, in its fullest extent, by Colonel P. L. 
Monteil (French) in 1890-1891. At the eastern end of the basin 
much light ha£ been thrown on the system of the Benue. In 185 1 
Barth crossed the Benue at its junction with the Faro, but the 
region of its sources was first explored by Flegel (188 2-1 884), 
who traversed the whole southern basin of the river and reached 
Ngaundere. Other German travellers added to the knowledge 
of the southern tributaries, the Tarabba, Donga and others, 
which in the rains bring down a large body of water from the 
highlands of southern Adamawa. British travellers who have 
done work in the same region are Sir W. Wallace, L. H. Moseley, 
W. P. Hewby, P. A. Talbot and Captain Claud Alexander. 
The last-named two were members of an expedition led by 
Lieut. Boyd-Alexander, who himself crossed Africa from the 
Niger to the Nile. Messrs Talbot and Claud Alexander surveyed 
the country between Ibi on the Benue and Lake Chad, mapping 
(1904) a considerable part of the Gongola. 1 In 1854 the Benue 
itself was ascended 400 m. by the " Pleiad " expedition, and in 
1889 to 13J E., and the Kebbi to Bifara by Major (afterwards 
Sir Claude) Macdonald, further progress towards the Tuburi 
marsh being prevented by the shallowness of the water. The 
upper basin of the Benue was also traversed by the French 
expeditions of Mizon (1892) and Maistre (1892-1893), the latter 
passing to the south of the Tuburi marsh without definitely 
settling the hydrographical question connected with it. This 
was accomplished by Captain Lenfant in 1903. He ascended the 
Kebbi and discovered the Lata Fall, continuing up the river to its 
point of issue from Tuburi. Crossing the marshes he found and 
navigated the narrow river leading to the Logone. Save for the 
porterage round the Lata Fall the whole journey from the mouth 
of the Niger to Lake Chad was made by water. The Benue in 
the neighbourhood of Yola was mapped in 1003-1904 by an 
Anglo-German boundary commission. 

From 1904 onwards the French undertook works on the Niger 
between Bamako — whence there is railway communication with 
the Senegal — and Ansongo with a view to deepening the channel 
and removing obstructions to navigation. In 1910 the British 
began dredging with the object of obtaining from the mouth of 
the river to Baro a minimum depth of 6 ft. of water. 

	1 Captain Claud Alexander died of fever in northern Nigeria on 
	the 30th of November 1904. His brother, Lieut. Boyd Alexander, 
	in a subsequent expedition across Africa was murdered in Wadai on 
	the 2nd of April 1910.

NIGERIA, a British protectorate in West Africa occupying the 
lower basin of the Niger and the country between that river and 
Lake Chad, including the Fula empire (i.e. the Hausa States) 
and the greater part of Bornu. It embraces most of the territory 
in the square formed by the meridians of 3 and 14 E. and the 
parallels of 4 and 14 N., and has an area of about 338,000 sq. m. 
The protectorate is bounded W. , N. and N.E. by French possessions 
(Dahomey, Upper Senegal and Niger colony, and Chad territory), 
S.E. by the German colony of Cameroon and S. by the Atlantic. 

Physical Features. — The country is divisible, broadly, into 
three zones running parallel with the coast: (1) the delta, (2) 
forest region, giving place to (3) the plateau region. The coast 
line, some 500 m. in length, extends along the Gulf of Guinea 
from 2 46' 55* E. to 8° 45' E. ending at the Rio del Rey, the point 
where the great bend eastwards of the continent ceases and the 
land turns south. The Niger (q.v.), which enters the protectorate 
at its N.W. corner and flows thence S.E. to the Atlantic, receives, 
250 m. from the sea, the Benue, which, rising in the mountains of 
Adamawa south of Lake Chad, flows west across the plateau. 
Into the huge delta of the Niger several other rivers (the " Oil 
Rivers ") empty themselves; the chief being, on the west, 
the Benin (q.v.), and on the east the Brass. East of the Niger 
delta is that formed by the Imo or Opobo, Bonny and other 
streams, and still farther east is the Calabar estuary, mainly 
formed by the Cross river (q.v.). West of the Niger delta are 
several independent streams discharging into lagoons, which 
here line the coast. The most westerly of these streams, the 
Ogun, enters the Lagos lagoon, which is connected by navigable 
waterways with the Niger (see Lagos). 

The delta region is swampy, and forms, for a distance of from 
40 to 70 m. inland, a network of interlacing creeks and broad 
sluggish channels fringed with monotonous mangrove forests. 
The main rivers are navigable for ocean-going steamers for a 
distance of from 15 to 40 m. from their mouths. Beyond the 
delta firm ground takes the place of mud and the mangroves 
disappear. The land rises gradually at first, becoming, however, 
in many districts very hilly, and is covered with dense forests. 
The Niger at its confluence with the Benue is not more than 
250 ft. above the sea. North of this point are hills forming 
the walls of the plateau which extends over the centre of the 

	Eir*ryWalk*r M- 

protectorate and is part of the great plateau of North Africa. 
This plateau, broken only by the valleys of the rivers, does 
not attain an elevation approaching that of the plateaus of the 
southern half of the continent, the culminating point (apart from 
particular mountain districts), situated in about io° N., reaching 
a height of 3000 ft. only. The valleys of the Niger and Benue, 
especially the latter, are very much lower, the town of Yola 
on the Benue, some 400 m. inland, lying at an altitude of little 
over 600 ft. The surface is generally undulating, with isolated 
" table mountains " of granite and sandstone often rising 
abruptly from the plain. It is clothed largely with thin forest, 
but becomes more open to the north until, near the French 
frontier, the arid steppes bordering the Sahara are reached. 
Much of the country north of Zaria (n° N.) is covered with 
heavy loose sand. The most mountainous districts are northern 
Bauchi (a little north of io°), where heights of 600c to 7000 ft. 
occur; parts of Muri, along the north bank of the Benue; 
and the southern border of the Benue basin, where the hills 
(consisting of ironstone, quartz and granite) appear rich in 
minerals. The mountainous area covers some 50,000 sq. m. 
On the east the plateau sinks to the plains of Bornu (q.v.) y which 
extend to Lake Chad. Tributaries of the Niger traverse the 
western portion of the country, the most noteworthy being 
the Gulbin Kebbi or Sokoto river and the Kaduna, which flows 
through a valley not more than 500 ft. above the sea. The 
north-eastern part of the country drains to Lake Chad by the 
Waubeor Yo, an intermittent stream, which in its lower course 
forms the Anglo-French boundary. The western portion of 
Lake Chad (q.v.) belongs to the protectorate, which contains 
no other large lake. The water parting between the Chad and 
Niger systems runs N.W. and S.E. from about Katsena in 
13 N. to the Bauchi hills. Of the tributaries of the Benue 
the most important is the Gongola. During the dry season most 
of the small rivers cease running and the water in the larger 
streams is low. The great rise of the Niger within the pro- 
tectorate takes place in August and September and there is a 
second rise about the beginning of the year. 

Geology, — The fundamental formation consists of crystalline rocks. 
From the edge of the coast belt to near the confluence of the^ Benue 
and Niger they are overlain by unfossiliferous sandstones, lying un- 
disturbed and possibly of the age of the sandstones of the Congo basin. 
Limestones, with fossils indicating a Tertiary age, have been found 
near Sokoto. Superficial deposits occupy the coast belt. Recent 
alluvium and a thick deposit of black earth border the upper reaches 
of the Benue and cover wide areas around Lake Chad. 

Climate. — The country lies wholly within the tropics. The 
climate of the coast-lands is moist and hot, and extremely unhealthy, 
malarial fever being prevalent and deadly. The annual rainfall in the 
delta regions varies between 100 and 140 or more inches; the mean 
temperature is over 8o° F. The heat does not vary greatly, rarely 
sinking below 70 , and not often exceeding 100 ° in the shade. The 
direction of the prevailing wind is S.W. Though unfavourable for 
the permanent residence of white men, the interior is much less 
deadly than the coast-lands. The northern part is a land of tornadoes. 
At the close of the dry season (end of February) cyclones from the 
N.E., usually accompanied by rain and thunder, burst over the land. 
They increase in frequency until they merge in the heavy rains 
which last from July to October. Then the " hamattan," or hot, dry 
wind from the Sahara, begins and brings with it clouds of impalpable 
dust. At this period the nights are cold, and in the north January 
and February are cold even in the day-time, while frosts are ex- 
perienced in the neighbourhood of Lake Chad. The temperature in 
the central part of the protectorate is much the same average as at 
the coast, but the range is far greater, varying from a shade minimum 
of 59 to a shade maximum of 107 . 1 The rainfall is much scantier 
on the plateaus than in the maritime regions, averaging in Northern 
Nigeria about 50 in. a year. There is evidence of the increasing 
desiccation of the whole country north of the forest belt. This 
desiccation is partly attributable to the unrestricted felling of wood 
practised for many centuries by the inhabitants. Along the northern 
border of the protectorate this has resulted in the encroachment of 
the Saharan desert over once fertile districts. 

The natives of the northern regions do not suffer to any extent 
from fever unless they move to a part of the country some distance 
from their home. Leprosy is common, especially in the inland towns; 
while ophthalmia is prevalent in the north, especially among the 
poorer classes, who are compelled to expose themselves to the 
blinding dust from the deserts and the excessive glare of the sun 
reflected from the burning sand. 

Fauna and Flora. — The animals of Nigeria include the elephant, 
lion, leopard, giraffe, hyena, West-African buffalo, many kinds of 
antelope and gazelle and smaller game. Monkeys are numerous in 
the forests, and snakes are common. The camel is found in the 
northern regions bordering the Sahara. In the rivers are rhinoceros, 
hippopotamus and crocodile. The manatus is also found. The birds 
include the ostrich, marabout, vultures, kites, hawks, ground horn- 
bill, great bustard, guinea fowl, partridge, lesser bustard, quail, 
snipe, duck, widgeon, teal, geese of various kinds, paraquets, doves, 
blue, bronze and green pigeons, and many others. Domestic animals 
include the horse and donkey in the plateaus, but baggage animals 
are rare in the coast-lands, where the tsetse fly is found. Mosquitoes' 
are also abundant throughout the delta. Herds of cattle and flocks 
of sheep and goats are numerous throughout the country. 

The mangrove is the characteristic tree of the swamps. North 
of the swamps the oil palm (Elaeis guineensis) flourishes abundantly. 
It is common as far as about 7 N. Rubber vines, mahogany, ebony 
and many valuable timber trees are found in the forest zone. Other 
trees, found chiefly on the plateaus, are the baobab, the shea-butter 
tree, the locust tree, gambier, palms, including the date and dum 
palm (Hyphaene), the tamarind, and, in the arid regions, the acacia 
and mimosa. 

Inhabitants. — The population of Nigeria is estimated at 
15,000,000. The Europeans (mostly British) number about a 
thousand, and are civil servants, soldiers, traders or missionaries. 
In the delta district and the forest zone the inhabitants are 
typical negroes. Besides the people of Benin, the coast tribes 
include the Jekri, living on the lower part of the Benin river 
and akin to the Yoruba, the Ijos, living in the delta east of the 
main mouth of the Niger, and the Ibos, occupying a wide tract 
of country just above the delta and extending for 100 m. east 
from the Niger to the Cross river. South of the Ibos live the 
Aros, a tribe of relatively great intelligence, who dominated 
many of the surrounding tribes and possessed an oracle or ju-ju 
of reputed great power. On the middle Cross river live the 
Akuna-kunas, an agricultural race, and in the Calabar region 
are the Efiks, Ibibios and Kwas. All these tribes are fetish 
worshippers, though Christian and Moslem missionaries have 
made numerous converts. The Efiks, a coast tribe which has 
come much into contact with white men, have adopted several 
European customs, and educated Efiks are employed in 
government service. The great secret society called Egbo (q.v.) 
is an Efik institution. Each tribe has a different ju-ju, and 
each speaks a separate language or dialect, the most widely 
diffused tongues being the Ibo and Efik, which have been 
reduced to writing. In general little clothing is worn, but none 
of the tribes go absolutely nude. In colour the majority are 
dark chocolate, others are coal-black (a tint much admired by 
the natives themselves) or dark yellow^brown. Cannibalism, 
human sacrifices and other revolting practices common to the 
tribes, are being gradually stamped out under British control. 

	1 Returns at Zungeru for 1903. 

Trial by ordeal and domestic slavery are still among the recog- 
nized institutions. 

In the northern parts of Nigeria the inhabitants are of more 
mixed blood, the negro substratum having been to a great 
extent driven out by the northern races of the continent. The 
most important race in Northern Nigeria is that of the Hausa 
(q.v.), among whom the superior classes adopted Mahommedanism 
in the 13th and 14th centuries. While the lower classes remained 
pagan, a fairly civilized system of administration, with an 
efficient judicial and fiscal organization, was established in the 
Hausa territories. The Hausa are keen traders and make ex- 
cellent soldiers. 

At the beginning of the 19th century the Hausa territories 
were conquered by another dominant Mahommedan race, the 
Fula (q.v.), who form a separate caste of cattle-rearers. Arab 
merchants are settled in some of the larger Hausa towns. 

In general the people living in the river valleys have been 
unaffected by Moslem propaganda either in blood or religion. 
Thus along the banks of the Niger, Benue and other streams, 
the inhabitants are negro and pagans, and generally of a purely 
savage though often rather fine type. Of these the Munshi, 
who inhabit the district nearest the junction of the Benue with 
the Niger, were long noted for their intractability and hostility 
to strangers, whom they attacked with poisoned arrows. The 
Yoraghums, their neighbours, were cannibals. Nearer Yola 
live the Battas, who also had a bad reputation. These tribes, 
under British influence, are turning to trade and agricultural 
pursuits. In the central hilly region of Kachia are other pagan 
tribes. They wear no clothes and their bodies are covered with 
hair. South of the Benue, near the Niger confluence, dwell 
the savage and warlike Okpotos, Bassas and other tribes. In 
the districts of Illorin and Borgu, west cf the Niger, the inhabit- 
ants are also negroes and pagan, but of a more advanced 
type than the tribes of the river valleys. To attempt any 
complete list of the tribes inhabiting Northern Nigeria would 
be vain. In the one province of Bauchi as many as sixty native 
languages are spoken. 

In Bornu (q.v.) the population consists of (1) Berberi or 
Kanuri, the ruling race, containing a mixture of Berber and 
negro blood, with many lesser indigenous tribes; (2) so-called 
Arabs, and (3) Fula. The country to the back of Lagos is largely 
inhabited by Yorubas (q.v.), and the people of Borgu according 
to some native traditions claim to have had a Coptic origin. 

Towns. — A large proportion of the population dwells in towns. 
The chief ports are Lagos (q.v.), capital of Southern Nigeria, 
with a population of about 50,000; Calabar (q.v.), pop. about 15,000, 
known as Old Calabar and Duke Town, on the Calabar river; Opobo, 
Bonny Town and Brass Town, all on the rivers of the same name. 
Brass Town contains a fine church, the gift of a native chief. These 
places are east of the Nun or main mouth of the Niger, where, on 
the western bank, is Akassa. Here are important engineering works 
and a slip for repairing ships. Further west at the Forcados mouth 
of the Niger is a town of the same name, which is the principal port 
of entry Tor the river. Benin (q.v.), about 60 m. inland from the 
mouth of the Benin river, and Bende, about 50 m. N.W. of Calabar, 
were noted ju-ju towns and have large populations. Wari and 
Sapele are towns in the Benin district. Owo, some 50 m. N. of Benin 
city, is an important trade centre for the Yoruba country, in which 
are the large cities of Abeokuta, Ibadan and Illorin, all separately 
noticed. On the Niger at the head of the delta are Asaba (west 
bank) and Onitsha (east bank); Iddah (Ida), in the palm-oil zone; 
Lokoja on the west bank opposite the confluence with the Benue, 
and the headquarters of the protectorate's military force; Baro, 
on the east bank, 70 m. above Lokoja, the river terminus of the 
Northern Nigeria railway; Egga, Mureji (at the Kaduna confluence), 
jebba and Bussa (g.v.). The administrative headquarters of Northern 
Nigeria are at Zungeru, on the Kaduna river, in 6° 09' 40" E., 
9 48' 32" N. 

Apart from the sea and river ports and the towns in Yorubaland, 
the chief centres of population are in the open plains east of the 
Niger. They are th'e capitals of various states founded by the 
Hausa. Of these cities the most important is Kano (q.v.), the great 
emporium of trade for the central Sudan, where Tuareg and Arab 
from the north meet merchants from the Niger, Lake Chad and 
the far southern regions. It is situated in 12 N. and 8° 32' E. 
Some 220 m. W.N.W. of Kano is Sokoto, on a tributary of the Niger 
of the same name. Sokoto is the religious and political centre of the 
Fula. Next in importance among the Hausa towns are Bauchi (or 
Yakoba), pop. over 50,000, 140 m. S.E. of Kano; Zaria (q.v.) t pop. 
about 60,000, 82 m. S.S.W. of Kano; Katsena (q.v.), 84 m. N.W. 
of Kano; Hadeija, near the N. eastern frontier; Gando.oo m. S.W. 
of Sokoto; Bida (q.v.), 25 m. N.W. of Egga on the Niger; and Yola 
(q.v.) on the Benue near the German frontier. J egga, 85 m. S.W. of 
Sokoto, is an important entrepdt for trade from the hinterland of 
the Guinea coast and the Hausa states. The chief towns of Bornu 
are Kuka (q.v.) on Lake Chad, and Maidugari, some 70 m. S.W. of 
that lake. Most of these towns are capitals of provinces and resi- 
dences of native princes subordinate to the British administration. 
They are nearly all surrounded by strong mud walls and outer dry 
moats. Their interior is divided into a series of compounds, each 
entered through a flat-roofed audience chamber. Inside are the 
beehive-shaped huts of the household. The gateways are strongly 
fortified. In addition to the towns mentioned there are many others 
containing populations of from 10,000 to 20,000, the bulk of the 
inhabitants of the Hausa countries being town dwellers. 

Communications, — The rivers are the great highways of com- 
munication, but, in consequence of the lowness of the water between 
October and May, navigation is then only possible for shallow draught 
stern-wheel steamers and launches. From the Forcados mouth of 
the Niger steamers can ascend the main stream as far as Tebba, 
a distance of 530 m. and, at some risk, to Fort Goldie, 30 m. farther 
up at the foot of the Bussa rapids. Steamers can also ascend the 
Benue to Yola, 480 m., above the confluence of that river with the 
Niger at Lokoja. It is also possible by this route to proceed by 
small boat via the Shari system to Lake Chad. The Kaduna from 
its confluence with the Niger can be ascended by steamer 50 m. to 
Barijuko, which is 22 m. by rail from Zungcru. The Gongola is 
navigable at high water for 130 m. from its junction with the Benue. 

In the delta region every place of importance is easily reached by 
river steamers, and there is a regular service between Forcados and 
Lagos by the lagoons. The Cross river is navigable 240 m. up to and 
beyond the frontier of Cameroon. 

A 3 ft. 6 in. gauge railway from the port of Lagos to Ibadan was 
completed in 1900, the distance by rail being 123 m. Only about half 
that distance intervenes between Ibadan and the sea. This line was, 
during 1 906-1 910, extended via Oshogbo, 1 florin and Jebba to 
Zungeru, whence it is continued to She, 40 m. E. of Zungeru and 
about 450 m. from Lagos, where a junction is effected with the Baro- 
Kano line. A small light surface line 22 m. long, 2 ft. 6 in. gauge was 
built ( 1 901-1902 )in Northern Nigeria between Barijuko on the Kaduna 
and the capital, Zungeru, and proved most successful and lucrative. In 
1907 the construction was begun of a 3 ft. 6 in. railway from Baro on 
the Niger via Bida and Zaria to Kano — a distance of about 400 m. 

Good roads connect some of the great Hausa cities, and Kano and 
Kuka are starting-points for caravans across the Sahara to the 
Mediterranean. There are also old established caravan routes from 
Kano to Ashanti and neighbouring countries. 

Regular communication is maintained with Europe by steamers 
running between Liverpool and Forcados, Bonny and Calabar, the 
steamers calling at other West African ports en route. The time 
occupied between Liverpool and Forcados is about seventeen days. 
Other steamers ply between the ports named (and others in the pro- 
tectorate) and London and Hamburg. There is telegraphic com- 
munication between Brass and Bonny and Europe by submarine 
cable, and land lines from Calabar to Lagos and from Lagos to Jebba, 
Lokoja, Zungeru, Kano, &c, a connexion being also effected with the 
telegraph system of French West Africa. 

Agriculture. — The natives of the coast region cultivate yams and 
other food plants, but in that district agriculture proper scarcely 
exists, the fruit of the oil-palm supplying an easy means of obtaining 
almost everything that the natives require. In the plains of the 
north, inhabited by Hausa and by agricultural pagan tribes, and in 
the fertile river valleys, agriculture is regularly carried on. Rice and 
wheat are cultivated in many parts, though the staple food is guinea 
corn. Sweet potatoes, ground nuts, yams, onions and other vege- 
tables are largely grown. Of fruits, dates, pomegranates, citrons 
and bananas abound in certain areas. The shea-butter tree supplies 
an excellent oil for lamps, and also for cooking, though it is only used 
by the poorer classes. ^ The most important vegetable products are 
cotton and indigo, which are univei^ally grown. Tobacco and kola 
nuts are also grown. 

Mineral Products. — Tin ore of excellent quality is found in the 
province of Bauchi, alkali salts are abundant in Kano province, 
iron ore and red and yellow ochres are found in Kontagora and other 
provinces, kaolin (china clay) and limestone in the west central 
regions. Silver and lead have been found in the Benue area. 1 

Trade. — Throughout Nigeria local trade is active and has shown 
rapid increase under British rule. Its further development will be 
fostered by the improvement of communications which is taking 
place. Export trade in the delta and forest regions is almost entirely 
confined to " jungle produce," the most important articles being 
palm oil and palm kernel. Rubber, ebony and other timber, cocoa 
and gum copal, comenext in importance. Cotton is also grown for 
export. The quantity of palm oil exported annually exceeds 
12.000,000 gallons, and is worth over £600,000. Of palm kernels

	i£00-ioo?; Southern Nigeria Mineral Survey 1005-100? (Miscella- 
	neous, Nos. 59, 67, 68). 

50,000 to 70,000 tons are shipped yearly, with an average value of 
£500,000 a year. The principal imports are cotton goods (nearly all 
from the United Kingdom), and in the southern region spirits — gin 
and geneva — almost wholly from Holland and Germany, salt, rice 
and other provisions, tobacco, hardware, cutlery and building 
material, &c, mostly from the United Kingdom. The value of the 
trade (imports and exports) of Southern Nigeria (exclusive of Lagos) 
increased from £1,566,000 in 1804-1895 to £3,4.64,000 in 1905. In 
1906 the total trade, inclusive of Lagos, was valued at £6,299,000 — 
imports, £3,148,000; exports, £3,151,000. 

In Northern Nigeria up to the moment of the British occupation 
the foreign trade was chiefly in the hands of Tripoli Arabs whose 
caravans crossed the desert at great risk and expense, and carried 
to the markets of Kuka and Kano tea, sugar and other European 
goods, taking away the skins and feathers which constituted the 
principal articles of export to the Mediterranean coast. There was 
also a very considerable caravan trade in native goods which the 
industrious Hausa population carried for great distances through the 
western and central states of the Sudan. The principal articles of 
this trade are salt, kola nuts, ivory, leather, sodium carbonates and 
spices. The centre of the cloth manufacture is Kano. The clotl> is 
made of the cotton grown in the country, woven on small hand- 
looms and dyed either with indigo or with a magenta dye obtained 
from the bark of a tree. If the Hausa history, which exists in written 
form, be correct, the manufacture of this cloth has been carried on 
in Kano since the 9th century. Kano and the district around it 
clothes half the population of the Sudan. The kola nut, chewed by 
almost every native of the country, is brought from west of the 
Niger, traders from Ashanti, Accra and Yorubaland frequenting the 
markets of J egga. Salt and " potash " are imported from Absen 
in the Sahara; and ivory, ostrich feathers and leather goods are 
exported to Tripoli. The principal exports to Great Britain have 
come hitherto from the forest regions, and are of the same class 
as the forest products of the south. Rubber constitutes at present 
the most important export. The cultivation of cotton is however 
indigenous to the country. Inquiries made under the auspices of 
the British Cotton Growing Association have led to the conclusion 
that Northern Nigeria offers the most promising field contained 
within the empire for the growth of cotton required to render 
Lancashire looms independent of foreign supplies. Steps have been 
taken to stimulate the native industry, and it is hoped that cotton 
may take the place in Northern Nigeria which palm oil and kernels 
occupy in the coast zone. Any great expansion in the cotton trade 
is however dependent on the development of cheap and efficient 
means of transport — hence the importance, commercially, of the 
Baro-Kano railway, with its base on the navigable Niger. With 
the increase of transport facilities it is probable that the trade with 
the Mediterranean coasts will also be diverted to the south, and profit- 
able minor branches of trade would be formed in leather, ostrich 
feathers, gums, fibres, &c. The imports from Great Britain, which 
come via Forcados, are mostly cotton goods, provisions and hard- 
ware. The importation of spirits is prohibited north of 7 N. 

Currency and Banking. — The legal currency, and that in general 
use, is British sterling. There is a subsidiary coinage (introduced in 
1908) consisting of a nickel penny and a nickel tenth of a penny 
(the last-named was first coined in aluminium, but this metal proved 
unsuitable and was withdrawn). Cowries (1000 = 3d.) are still 
occasionally employed, and on the coast, accounts are sometimes kept 
in gallons of palm oil. Banking is in the hands of the Bank of 
British West Africa and the Bank of Nigeria. There is also a 
government savings bank. 

History. 

Of the early history of the races inhabiting the coast lands 
little is known. The Beni appear to have been the most powerful 
race at the time of the discovery of the coast by the Portuguese 
in the 15th century, and the kings of Benin in the 17th century 
ruled a large part of the south-western portion of the existing 
British protectorate (see Benin). The Benin influence does 
not seem to have reached east of the Forcados mouth of the 
Niger. In the greater part of the delta region each town owned 
a different chief and there was no one dominant tribe. Among 
these people, who occupied a low position even among the de- 
generate coast negroes, and who were constantly raided by the 
more virile tribes of the interior, trading stations were established 
by the Portuguese, and later on by other Europeans, British 
traders appearing as early as the 17th century. There was no 
assertion of political rights by the white men, who were largely 
at the mercy of the natives, and who rarely ventured far from 
their ships or the " factories " established on the various rivers 
and estuaries. 

By the end of the 18th century British enterprise had almost 
entirely displaced that of other nations on the Niger coast. 
But the principal trade of all Europeans was still in slaves. 

After the abolition of the slave-trade in the 19th century palm 
oil formed the staple article of commerce, and the various 
streams which drain the Niger coast near the mouth of the 
great river became known as the " Oil Rivers." The opening 
up of the interior was in the meantime promoted, chiefly by the 
efforts of British travellers and merchants. Mungo Park traced 
the Niger from Segu to Bussa, where he lost his life in 1805. 
From Bussa to the sea the course of the river was first made 
known in 1830 by the ^brothers Richard and John Lander. 
Major Dixon Denham and Captain Hugh Clapperton entered 
the country now known as Northern Nigeria from the north 
in 1823, crossing the desert from Tripoli. Clapperton in 1826- 
1827 made a second journey, approaching the same territory 
from the Guinea coast. Dr Barth, travelling under the auspices 
of the British government, entered the country from the north 
and made the journeys, lasting over two years between 1852 
and 1855, of which he has left the record that still remains 
the principal standard work for the interior. Macgregor Laird 
first organized in 1832 the navigation of the river Niger from 
its mouth to a point above the Benue confluence. During the 
next twenty-five years expeditions were despatched into the 
interior, and a British consul was posted at Lokoja. Possession 
was also taken, in 1861, of Lagos island, with the object of 
checking the slave trade still being carried on in that region. 
But the deadly climate discouraged the first efforts of the British 
government, and, after the parliamentary committee of 1865 
had recommended a policy which would render possible the 
ultimate withdrawal of British official influence from the coast, 
the consulate of Lokoja was abandoned. 

It was re-established a few years later to meet the still steadily 
growing requirements of British trade upon the river. In 1880 
the influence of the international " scramble for Africa " made 
itself felt by the establishment under the recognized protection 
of the French government of two French firms which opened 
upwards of thirty trading stations on the Lower Niger. The 
establishment of these firms was admittedly a political move 
which coincided with the extension of French influence from 
Senegal into the interior. Nearly at the same time a young 
Englishman, George Goldie-Taubman, afterwards better known 
as Sir George Goldie (q.v.), having some private interests on 
the Niger, conceived the idea of amalgamating all local British 
interests and creating a British province on the Niger. To 
effect this end the United African Company was formed in 
Formation l879 ' an< * trac * e was Pushed upon the river with 
of the an energy which convinced the French firms of the 
Royal futility of their less united efforts. They yielded 
*te£ r the field and allowed themselves to be bought out 

mpany. ^ y ^ United African Company in 1884. At the 
Berlin Conference held in 1884-1885 the British representative 
was able to state that Great Britain alone possessed trading 
interests on the Lower Niger, and in June 1885 a British pro- 
tectorate was notified over the coast lands known as the Oil 
Rivers. Germany had in the meantime established itself 
in Cameroon, and the new British protectorate extended along 
the Gulf of Guinea from the British colony of Lagos on the 
west to the new German colony on the east, where the Rio del 
Rey marked the frontier. In the following year, 1886, the 
United African Company received a royal charter under the 
title of the Royal Niger Company. The territories which were 
placed by the charter under the control of the company were 
those immediately bordering the Lower Niger in its course from 
the confluence at Lokoja to the sea. On the coast they extended 
from the Forcados to the Nun mouth of the river. Beyond 
the confluence European trade had not at that time penetrated 
to the interior. 

The interior was held by powerful Mahommedan rulers who 
had imposed a military domination upon the indigenous races 
and were not prepared to open their territories to European 
intercourse. To secure British political influence, and to preserve 
a possible field for future development, the Niger Company 
had negotiated treaties with some of the most important of these 
rulers, and the nominal extension of the company's territories 
was carried over the whole sphere of influence thus secured. 
The movements of Germany from the south-east, and of France 
from the west and north, were thus held in check, and by securing 
international agreements the mutual limits of the three European 
powers concerned were definitely fixed. The principal treaties 
relating to the German frontiers were negotiated in 1886 and 
1893: the Anglo-French treaties were more numerous, those 
of 1890 and 1898, which laid down the main lines of division 
between French and British possessions on the northern and 
western frontiers of Nigeria, having been supplemented by many 
lesser rectifications of frontier. (See Africa, § 5.) It was not 
until 1009 that the whole of the frontier between Nigeria and the 
French and German possessions had been definitely demarcated. 
Thus, mainly by the action of the Royal Niger Company, a 
territory of vast extent, into which the chartered company 
itself was not able to carry either administrative or trading 
operations, was secured for Great Britain. In 1897, at a time 
when disputes with France upon the western frontier had 
reached a very active staged the company entered upon a 
campaign against the Mahommedan sovereign of Nupe. This 
campaign would, no doubt, have led to important results had 
the company retained its administrative powers. In the ex- 
pedition a force of 500 Hausa, drilled and trained by the company, 
and led by thirty white officers — of whom some were lent for 
the occasion by the War Office — decisively defeated a force 
of some thousands of native troops, led by the emir of Nupe 
himself. The capital town of Bida was taken and the emir 
deposed. From Bida the expedition marched to Illorin, where 
again the whole district submitted to the authority of the 
company. In Illorin the campaign had some lasting effect. 
In Nupe, on the northern side of the river, as the company 
was unable to occupy the territory conquered, things shortly 
reverted to their previous condition. When the company's 
troops were withdrawn the deposed emir returned and reoccupied 
the throne, leaving the situation to be dealt with after the 
territories of the company had been transferred to the crown. 

The complications to which the pressure of foreign nations, 
and especially of France, on the frontiers of the territories 
gave rise, became at this period so acute that the rnasferof 
resources of a private company were manifestly authority 
inadequate to meet the possible necessities of the to tho 
position. Relations with France on the western crowo * 
border became so strained that in 1897 Mr Chamberlain, 
who was then secretary of state for the colonies, thought it 
necessary to raise a local force, afterwards known as the West 
African Frontier Force, for the special defence of the frontiers 
of the West African dependencies. In these circumstances 
it was judged advisable to place the territories of the Royal 
Niger Company, to which the general name of Nigeria had been 
given, under the direct control of the crown. It was therefore 
arranged that in consideration of compensation for private 
rights the company should surrender its charter and transfer 
all political rights in the territories to the Crown. The transfer 
took place on the 1st of January 1900, from which date the 
company, which dropped the name of " royal," became a purely 
trading corporation. The southern portion of the territories 
was amalgamated with the Niger Coast Protectorate, the whole 
district taking the name of the Protectorate of Southern Nigeria, 
while the northern portion, extending from a line drawn slightly 
above 7 N. to the frontier of the French possessions on the north 
and including the confluence of the Niger and the Benue at 
Lokoja, was proclaimed a protectorate under the name of 
Northern Nigeria. 

The company, during its tenure of administrative power 
under the charter, had organized its territories south of the 
confluence, into trading districts, over each of which there 
was placed a European agent. The executive powers in Africa 
were entrusted to an agent general with three provincial 
and twelve district superintendents. There was a small judicial 
staff directed by a chief justice, and there was a native con- 
stabulary of about 1000 men, trained and drilled by white 
officers. The company kept also upon the river a fleet of about 

1883' 1906. 

thirty steamers. The entire direction of the proceedings of the 
company was, however, in the hands of the council in London, 
and the administrative control of the territories was practically 
from first to last vested in the person of Sir George Goldie. The 
local work of the representatives of the company was mainly 
commercial. When, on the surrender of the charter, Sir George 
Goldie withdrew from the company, the administrative element 
disappeared. No administrative records were handed over, 
and very little machinery remained. Two enactments, however, 
bore testimony to the legislation of the company. One, which 
by force of circumstances remained inoperative, was the abolition 
of the legal status of slavery, proclaimed in the year of Queen 
Victoria's jubilee (1897). The other, more practical, which has 
remained in operation to the present day, confirmed and enforced 
by the succeeding administration, was the absolute prohibition 
of the trade in spirits beyond the parallel of 7 N. 

While the development of the Royal Niger Company's terri- 
tories was proceeding in the manner described, the regions 
Progress unc * er di rect British control were also being opened up 
in ' and law and order introduced. In 1893, when the title 
southern Oil Rivers Protectorate was changed to that of Niger 
Nigeria, Coast Protectorate, a regular administration was 
established (subject to the Foreign Office in London) 
under Sir Claude Macdonald, who was succeeded as 
commissioner and consul-general in 1896 by Sir Ralph Moor 
( 1 860-1 909). Under these officials peace was gradually estab- 
lished hetween various tribes, trade routes opened and progress 
made in civilization. The work was one of extreme difficulty, 
largely hecause there was no central native authority with which 
to deal. Small military expeditions had constantly to be 
employed to break up slave-raiding gangs or reduce to order 
tribes which blocked trade routes or made war on other tribes 
living peaceably under British protection. The most serious 
military operations were against the Beni, a peaceful mission to 
the king of Benin having been massacred in the bush in January 
1897. The operations were completely successful and the Benin 
country was added to the protectorate (see Benin). In 1900, as 
stated, the southern portion of the Niger Company's territories 
was added to the protectorate, the change in administration 
being effected without difficulty of any kind. Sir Ralph Moor 
continued until 1904 to govern the country under the style of 
high commissioner. The efforts of the administration to better 
the condition of the natives without undue interference with 
customary law met with encouraging results, and the sub- 
mission of the Aros to the government in 1902 brought to an 
end the system of tribal warfare for the purpose of making 
slaves, while the enforcement of a proclamation of 1901 prohibit- 
ing the buying, pawning or selling of slaves had a salutary effect. 
Trade steadily developed, and owing to the large sums paid 
as duty on imported spirits, the revenue of the protectorate was 
sufficient to cover the expenditure. 

In Northern Nigeria in 1900 the establishment of British 
authority remained still to be effected. The man selected for the 
post of first high commissioner was Colonel — afterwards better 
known as Sir Frederick — Lugard, who had conducted one of the 
Royal Niger company's most successful expeditions into the 
western portion of the interior and had already been employed 
by the British government to raise and organize the West 
African Frontier Force. 

The transference of influence from the company to the govern- 
ment was officially effected on the 1st of January 1900, on which 
Northern ^ a ^ tnc Union Jack was hoisted at Lokoja, and the 
Nigeria formation of a local administration was entered upon. 
brought The number of civilians in the employ of the govern- 
ment was very small, and the administrative machinery 
had to be evolved under the pressure of a somewhat 
acute military situation. The headquarters of the West African 
Frontier Force had been at Jebba, not far from the point at 
which Mungo Park had lost his life upon the river. Neither 
Jebba nor Lokoja was considered suitable for the permanent 
capital of the protectorate, and survey parties were sent out, 
with strict orders to avoid conflict with the nominally friendly 
natives, to find a more suitable site. This was selected on a 
branch of the Kaduna river in the south-western corner of the 
province of Zaria, at a place of which the native name of Zungeru 
was retained. The ruler of Zaria, while professing friendliness, 
was, however, unable or unwilling to restrain the rulers of Konta- 
gora and Nupe from aggression. These two potentates raided 
for slaves to the borders of the rivers and openly threatened the 
British position on the Niger. The Ashanti War of 1000 claimed 
the despatch of a strong detachment of the West African Frontier 
Force, and it was not until the return of the troops in February 

1901 that Nupe and Kontagora could be effectively dealt with. 
In that year both provinces were subdued, their emirs deposed, 
and letters of appointment given to new emirs, who undertook 
to rule in accordance with the requirements of humanity, to 
abolish slave-raiding and slave dealing, and to acknowledge 
the sovereignty of Great Britain. Illorin and Borgu with a 
portion of Kabba were already under British rule. The rulers 
of other neighbouring provinces offered their allegiance, and 
by the end of the year 1901 nine provinces, Illorin, Kabba, 
Middle Niger, Lower Benue, Upper Benue, Nupe, Kontagora, 
Borgu and Zaria had accepted the British occupation. These 
territories, with the exception of Zaria, were all in the more or 
less immediate neighbourhood of the valleys of the Niger and 
the Benue, and Zaria bordered upon the Kaduna. For all these 
territories an initial system of administration was organized, 
and British residents were appointed to each province. Seven- 
teen legislative proclamations were enacted in the first year 
dealing with the immediate necessities of the position, and 
providing for the establishment of a supreme and provincial 
court of justice, for the legalization of native courts of justice, 
and dealing with questions of slavery, importation of liquor 
and firearms, land titles, &c. In the autumn of 1901 the emir 
of Yola, the extreme eastern corner of the territories bordering 
upon the Benue, was, in consequence of the aggressions upon 
a trading station established by the Niger Company, dealt with 
in the same manner as the emirs of Nupe and Kontagora, and a 
new emir was appointed under British rule. In 1902 Bauchi and 
Bornu were brought under British rule. In Bauchi the emir was 
deposed and a new emir was appointed. In Bornu the extension 
of British authority was very willingly accepted as a guarantee 
against other European encroachments, and the legitimate Shehu 
was restored to the throne under British protection. Military 
stations were established in Bornu and in Bauchi, and both 
provinces were included in the system of British administration. 
Later in the same year an act of treachery culminating in the 
murder of a British resident, Captain Moloney, in the province 
of Nassarawa, led to the military subjugation of that province. 
The murderer fled northwards through Zaria to Kano, which 
was still an independent Mahommedan state. The emir of Zaria 
was found to be in treasonable correspondence with the emir 
of Kano. It was thought desirable to arrest and dethrone him, 
and his prime minister was temporarily appointed to administer 
the province under British protection. To all these provinces 
British residents were appointed, and British legislative enact- 
ments became applicable to them all. By the end of the year 
1902 British administration had heen extended to the whole of 
the provinces in the south, east and west of the protectorate. The 
important Mahommedan states of Sokoto, Gando, Kano and 
Katsena remained independent. These states were regarded as 
the stronghold of Fula supremacy. The emir of Sokoto held the 
position of religious as well as political head of all the lesser 
states of Northern Nigeria, and in response to friendly overtures 
on the part of the British administration had declared that 
between Sokoto and Great Britain there could be nothing but 
war. Katsena was the centre of local learning, while Kano was 
at once the commercial and the military centre of power. By 
the end of 1902 it had become evident that a trial of strength 
between the Mahommedan powers and the new British admin- 
istration was inevitable. The Mahommedan rulers were them- 
selves of comparatively recent date. In fighting them there was 
no question of fighting the whole country. On the contrary it 
was presumed with justice that their overthrow would be hailed 
with satisfaction by many of the subject peoples. Every attempt 
was made to settle the question at issue by conciliatory methods, 
but these having failed, a campaign against Kano and Sokoto 
was entered upon in January 1903. It was entirely successful. 
The capital of Kano, a walled and fortified town of great extent 
and formidable strength, fell to a British assault in February of 
1903. Sokoto submitted after a battle which took place on the 
17th of May. The sultan fled, and on the 21st of May a new 
sultan, chosen by the council of elders, was installed by the 
British high commissioner, after he had publicly accepted the 
conditions imposed by the British government. These conditions 
were that all rights of conquest acquired by the Fulani throughout 
Northern Nigeria passed to Great Britain, that for the future 
every sultan and emir and principal officer of state should 
be appointed by Great Britain, that the emirs and chiefs so 
appointed should obey the laws of the British government, that 
they should no longer buy and sell slaves, nor enslave people, 
that they should import no firearms, except flint-locks, that 
they should enforce no sentences in their courts of law which were 
contrary to humanity, and that the British government should 
in future hold rights in land and taxation. When these con- 
ditions were accepted by the Fulani chiefs the supremacy of 
Great Britain was established over the entire country. Katsena 
and Gando followed the example set to them by Kano and 
Sokoto. Throughout Northern Nigeria all chiefs, Mahommedan 
and Pagan, now hold their appointments under the British 
crown-and take the oath of allegiance to the British sovereign. 

It remained to organize the territories for British rule, to 
institute a reformed system of taxation, to establish courts of 
justice, and to open the country to civilized occupation. 

The following account of the legislation carried into force up 
to 1907 shows in effect what was done in that direction. After 
the conquest of the Hausa States in 1902^1903 the king's writ 
ran — with the exception of a few districts inhabited by primitive 
savages — through the whole area known as Northern Nigeria. 
The temporary enactments of the earlier days were then super- 
seded by laws based upon a more accurate knowledge of local 
conditions and rendered possible by the effective administration 
which had been set up throughout the country. 

Courts of Law and Administration of Justice.-~K superior court 
was set up with jurisdiction over all non-natives and government 
employes. Its jurisdiction over natives was limited to the two 
centres of administration named " cantonments," and to such neigh- 
bouring territories as might be included by regulation within a 
feasible distance of those centres. It could, however, try any case 
in any province by special warrant of the high commissioner. The 
whole country was divided into seventeen provinces, in each of which 
there was a provincial court presided over by the resident in charges 
whose assistants were commissioners of the court. They submitted 
their lists of criminal trials to the high commissioner, who, advised 
by the attorney-general, acted as a court of a appeal, and no sentence 
exceeding six months could take effect without his confirmation. 
Cases could be referred by him for re-trial in the superior court if 
he so decided. A criminal code was drawn up, together with a 
criminal procedure proclamation.^ Native courts were established 
by warrant at all the chief native towns with varying powers. 
They were of two classes, the " Alkalis' Court," presided over by 
trained Mahommedan jurists, and " Judicial Councils," under the 
leading chiefs and natives presided over by the emir or other native 
ruler. In these courts native^ law and customs (principally the 
Mahommedan law) were administered with the proviso that jio 
penalty could be enforced which was contrary to the laws of humanity 
or opposed to any specific proclamation of the protectorate. With 
the exception of two or three of the most enlightened courts, the 
criminal powers of these courts were restricted, but in civil actions 
they had full scope. No native court could carry a sentence of 
death into execution without the concurrence of the resident. 

Cantonment courts were also set up in the two chief government 
centres (Zungeru and Lokoja), chiefly for the purpose of enforcing 
sanitary and municipal regulations. These were affiliated to the 
superior courts. 

Lands and Minerals. — These constitute the main asset of the 
government. In the first instance, as following upon conquest or 
potential conquest, the Fulani emirs who were appointed by 
government to each of the great native states were installed under a 
letter of appointment in which (in addition to rights of legislation, 
taxation and other powers inherent in suzerainty) the ultimate 
title to all land was transferred from the Fulani dynasty and vested 
in the British. Private ownership was not interfered with, but all 
waste lands became the property of the crown, and no non-native 
could acquire title except as from the governments Similarly the 
sole title to minerals (subject to the share of profits assigned to the 
Niger Company by the deed of transfer) was vested in the govern- 
ment, and the terms upon which licences to prospect or mine could 
be acquired, together with full regulations regarding mining, were 
enacted by law. The right of natives to smelt iron and the question 
of compensation for any other existing mining industry or for surface 
disturbance was left to the discretion of government. 

Slavery. — Practical effect was given to the abolition of the legal 
status of slavery, in so far as all British courts were concerned. 
This decree had been promulgated before the transfer of the ad- 
ministration, but had existed merely on paper. Every slave could 
thereby assert his freedom if he desired to do so, but it was not made 
illegal for a native to own a slave, ano! no penalty attached to mere 
possession in such a case. Slave-dealing and transactions of every 
land in slaves were now made illegal. CivH questions arising from 
the institution of domestic slavery remained justiciable by the native 
courts; which in this matter were very carefully supervised by the 
British administration. 

Taxation. — In the earlier years of the administration the tolls 
upon trade in transit, which had existed from time immemorial and 
had become the means of much extortion, were made a monopoly 
of the government, and were reorganized on an equitable and popular 
basis. To these were added certain licences (e.g. on canoes, &c). 
In 1905 a complete reorganization of the direct taxation of the country 
was introduced. The innumerable taxes upon agriculture and in- 
dustry of all kinds were consolidated into two principal taxes, viz. 
the land and general tax — in its nature an income tax— and the 
jangali or cattle tax upon nomad herdsmen. The imposition of this 
tax involved a rough and ready assessment of every village in the 
protectorate. Under this system the oppression and extortion 
practised under native rule gave place to a carefully regulated 
method of assessment. At its initiation the proceeds were divided 
in approximately equal shares between the central government and 
the native administration, and a means was thus found of creating 
a legitimate revenue for the native chiefs to supersede the proceeds 
of slave-raiding and slave-dealing, and of oppression and extortion, 
by which they had hitherto supplied their needs. As in India, the 
village with its lands and cultivation was constituted the unit of 
assessment, and the provinces were divided into districts under 
native headmen responsible for the collection of the tax, and its 
payment to the paramount chief, who in turn rendered the assigned 
share to district and village chiefs, to the officers of state recognized 
by government and to the government itself. The administrative 
officers were entrusted with the assessment and acted as arbitrators 
and referees in case of illegal exactions. <In the Pagan districts 
where no native machinery existed and no previous taxation had 
been in force, a nominal impost was levied^and collected by the 
officers of the government through the ageifcy of the village chiefs. 
The taxation of the great cities formed a separate and very difficult 
problem. The law laid down the method to be employed in this 
case, but 'pending the completion of the rural taxation this detailed 
application of the system was allowed to rerriatnjn suspense. l£ was 
hoped thatfie soon as the scheme could be effectively put into opera- 
tion the taxes on trade in transit could be largely if not completely 
abolished, and the traders and merchants— ;the wealthiest class of 
the community — would be assessed in their city domiciles. By 
these means a large and rapidly increasing revenue is being secured 
to government; while the condition of the peasantry and people is 
being greatly ameliorated, an adequate but not excessive income is 
being secured to the native rulers; and the class of middlemen 
who lived by extortion and absorbed a great part of the wealth of 
the country is being abolished. 

Native Rulers. — By the operation of the native courts proclamation, 
the taxation proclamation, and finally by the enforcement of native 
authority proclamations, the status of the native rulers, their powers 
and authority, were defined and legalized. They receive the support 
of the government within the limits of their recognized sphere of 
action. The ^reat chiefs are appointed by the government in 
consultation with the principal men, and in accordance with native 
customs and laws of succession. Minor chiefs are nominated by 
their paramount chiefs, subject to the approval of the high com- 
missioner. 

Military and Police. — The defensive force — the Northern Nigeria 
Regiment of the West African Frontier Force — is constituted by 
law, and the proclamation contains a military code based on the 
Army _ Act with modifications necessary in local circumstances. 
A police force is similarly organized and controlled by a second 
enactment. The military force is divided into three regiments 
and two batteries of artillery under the supreme command of a 
commandant. The distribution of the garrisons is under the direc- 
tion of the high commissioner. The police, on the other hand, are 
more or less equally divided between the provinces (including the 
establishment at each cantonment), and while their interior economy 
and organization rests in the hands of a commissioner, they are 
for purposes of duty under the control of the resident of the province. 
A district superintendent is appointed to each province. 

Miscellaneous Enactments.— A variety of other enactments deals 
with minor matters of administration. Commissions of inquiry may 
be appointed by the high commissioner to investigate the conduct 
of an individual or department and take evidence on oath. Discipline 
on board of steamers is prescribed by the Marine Discipline Act. 
The preservation of wild animals and birds in accordance with 
international agreements is enforced by law. The importation or 
possession of arms of precision is forbidden, except by permits in 
conformity with the Brussels Act, and in further application of that 
act the importation of spirits for sale to natives is wholly prohibited. 
The cantonments are regulated by a municipal ordinance, establish- 
ing rates and laying down various regulations for order and sani- 
tation. In order to prevent hydrophobia dogs may only be kept 
under certain restrictions. Patents, marriages (of non-natives), &c, 
&c, form the subject of other laws. 

Administrative Divisions. — For administrative purposes the 
territories were at first divided into seventeen provinces: Sokoto, 
Gando, Kano, Katsena, Bornu East, Bornu West, Zaria, Bauchi, 
Borgu, Kontagora, Nassarawa, Muri, Yola, Bassa, Kabba, Illorin, 
Nupe. Of these Sokoto and Gando, Kano and Katsepa, Bornu East 
and Bornu West have been carried a step further in organization 
and now form three double provinces, each under the charge of a 
first-class resident. Illorin, Nupe and Kabba have been formed 
into one province called the Niger province, and also placed under 
the charge of a first-class resident, and it is intended to continue 
this process so as to make finally eight first-class provinces of the 
whole territory. The first-class residents of the double provinces 
are assisted by about twelve residents and assistant residents of 
subordinate rank. In the Mahommedan states the native system 
of administration remains intact, and is carried on under British 
supervision by native emirs and officials. In the Pagan states there 
is no organized system of native administration, and the British 
residents are responsible for good government. 

Amalgamation of Lagos and Southern Nigeria. — The political 
reasons which had resulted in the Nigerian territories being 
divided into three distinct administrations no longer existing, 
it was decided to unite them under one government, and as a 
first step in that direction Sir Walter (then Mr) Egerton was in 
1904 appointed both governor of Lagos and high commissioner 
of Southern Nigeria. This was followed in February 1906 by 
the amalgamation of the two administrations under the style of 
" the Colony and Protectorate of Southern Nigeria," with head- 
quarters at Lagos town. The former colony and protectorate 
of Lagos (q.v.) became the western or Lagos province of the new 
administration. In the year the amalgamation was effected 
the revenue reached a record figure, the amount collected being 
£1,088,000, to which Lagos province contributed £424,000. 
Over 80% of the revenue was derived from customs. In the 
same year the expenditure from revenue was £1,056,000. 

Northern Nigeria Railway. — In Northern Nigeria, which con- 
tinued for the time to be a separate protectorate, Sir Frederick 
Lugard was, at the beginning of 1907, succeeded as high com- 
missioner by Sir Percy Girouard. In August of that year the 
British government, on administrative, strategic and commercial 
grounds, came to a decision to build a railway which should place 
the important cities of Zaria and Kano in direct communication 
with the perennially navigable waters of the Lower Niger. In 
view of the approaching unification of Southern and Northern 
Nigeria, the money needed, about £1,250,000, was raised as a loan 
by Southern Nigeria. The route chosen for the line was that 
advocated by Sir Frederick Lugard. This important work, 
essential for the welfare of the northern territories, was begun 
under the superintendence of Sir Percy Girouard, 1 the builder 
of the Wadi Haifa-Khartum railway. At the same time the 
decision was taken to continue the Lagos railway till it effected 
a junction with the Kano line near Zungeru, the Niger being 
bridged at Jebba. 

Land Tenure. — Sir Percy Girouard devoted much attention to 
land tenure, probably the most important of the questions 
concerning imperial policy in West Africa. He adopted the land 
policy of Sir F. D. Lugard, and recommended " a declaration in 
favour of the nationalization of the lands of the Protectorate." 
This was in accord with native laws — that the land is the pro- 
perty of the people, held in trust for them by their chiefs, who 
have not the power of alienation. Thereafter the secretary for 
the colonies appointed a strong committee, which, after hearing 
much evidence, issued a report in April 1910 in substantial 
agreement with the governor's recommendations. This policy 

	1 In 1909 Sir Percy Girouard was succeeded by Sir H. H. J. Bell. 
	The title High Commissioner had meantime been changed to that of 
	Governor. 

was adopted by the Colonial Office. By this means the natives 
of Nigeria were secured in the possession of their land — the 
government imposing land taxes, which are the equivalent of rent. 
This exclusion of the European land speculator and denial of 
the right to buy and sell land and of freehold tenure was held by 
all the authorities to be essential for the moral and material 
welfare of the inhabitants of a land where the duty of the white 
man is mainly that of administration and his material advantages 
lie in trade. (See an article on " Land Tenure in West Africa " 
in The Times , May 24, 19 10.) 

Authorities. — Of early books dealing with large areas of Nigeria, 
H. Barth's Travels and Discoveries in North and Central Africa 
(London, 1 857-1 858) is a standard authority. See also Lady Lugard, 
A Tropical Dependency (London, 1905); Boyd Alexander, From the 
Niger to the Nue (London, 1907) ; C. Larymore, A Resident's Wife in 
Nigeria (London^ 1908); the annual Reports on Southern and 
Northern Nigeria issued by the Colonial Office ; E. D. Morel, Affairs 
of West Africa (London, 1902) ; C. H. Robinson, Hausaland (London, 
1896); S. Vandeleur, Campaigning on the Upper Nile and Ni$er 
(London, 1898), with introduction by Sir George Goldie; Major 
A. G. Leonard, The Lower Niger and its Tribes (London, 1906); 
C. Partridge, The Cross River Natives (London, 1905); E. Dayrell, 
Folk Stories from Southern Nigeria (London, 1910). Maps of the 
country on the scale of T.inrJ.TSflTS and szTihim are published by the 
War Office. The Blue Books, Cd. 2325 (1904), 2787 (1905) and 
4523 (1909), deal with railway construction, harbours and river 
navigation. (F. L. L.) 


NIGHT, that part of the natural day of twenty-four hours 
during which the sun is below the horizon, the dark part of the 
day from sunset to sunrise (see Day). The word in 0. Eng. takes 
two forms, neaht and night, the latter form apparently being 
established by about the 10th century. The word is common 
in varying forms to Indo-European languages. The root is 
usually taken to be nak- } to perish, the word meaning the time 
when the light fails (cf. Gr. vckos, Lat. nex, death, nocere 7 to hurt). 
It was customary to reckon periods of time by nights, and we still 
use " fortnight " (0. Eng. feowertyne niht t fourteen nights), but 
" se'n-night " (seven nights) has been displaced by " week " (q.v.). 


NIGHTINGALE, FLORENCE (1820-1910), younger daughter 
of William Edward Nightingale of Embley Park, Hampshire, 
and Lea Hurst, Derbyshire, was born at Florence on the 15th 
of May 1820, and named after that city, but her childhood was 
spent in England, chiefly in Derbyshire. From her earliest years 
her strong love of nature and animals manifested itself. Her 
games, too, were characteristic, for her great delight was to 
nurse and bandage her dolls. Her first living patient was a 
shepherd's dog. From tending animals she passed to human 
beings, and wherever there was sorrow or suffering she was sure 
to be found. Her most ardent desire was to use her talents for 
the benefit of humanity. She had a natural shrinking from 
society; and though her social position necessitated her presenta- 
tion at Court, her first season in town was spent in examining 
into the working of hospitals, reformatories and other charitable 
institutions. This was followed by a tour of inspection of foreign 
hospitals. At that time England was sadly behind-hand in 
matters of nursing and sanitation, and Miss Nightingale, who 
desired to obtain the best possible teaching for herself, went 
through a course of training in the Institute of Protestant 
Deaconesses at Kaiserswerth. She remained there six months, 
learning every detail of hospital management with a thoroughness 
rarely equalled. Miss Nightingale neglected nothing that could 
make her proficient in her self-chosen task. From Kaiserswerth 
she went to Paris, wbere she studied the system of nursing and 
management in the hospitals under the charge of the sisters of 
St Vincent de Paul. After her return to England she devoted 
herself to reorganizing the Governesses' Sanatorium in Harley 
Street (now the Home for Gentlewomen during Temporary 
Illness), which was at that time badly managed and in great 
need of funds. Miss Nightingale grudged neither time nor money 
to this work, and she had the satisfaction of placing it on a 
thoroughly satisfactory basis. 

In the year 1854 England was stirred to its depths by the 
report of the sufferings of the sick and wounded in the Crimea. 
There was an utter absence of the commonest preparations to 
cany out the first and simplest demands in a place set apart 
to receive the sick and wounded of a large army- . The condition 
of the large barrack-hospital at Scutari was deplorable. A royal 
commission of inquiry was appointed, a patriotic fund opened, 
and money flowed in fast. To Miss Nightingale this proved the 
trumpet-call of duty. She wrote to Sidney Herbert, secretary 
at war, and offered her services. Her letter crossed with one 
from him inviting her to proceed to the Crimea. She set out on 
the 24th October with a staff of thirty-seven nurses, partly 
volunteers, partly professionals trained in hospitals. They 
reached Scutari on the 4th of November, in time to receive the 
Balaklava wounded. A day or two later these were joined by 
600 from Inkerman. The story of Miss Nightingale's labours at 
Scutari is one of the brightest pages in English annals. She gave 
herself, body and soul, to the work. She would stand for twenty 
hours at a stretch to see the wounded accommodated. She 
regularly took her place in the operation-room, to hearten the 
sufferers by her presence and sympathy, and at night she would 
make her solitary round of the wards, lamp in hand, stopping 
here and there to speak a kindly word to some patient. Soon she 
had 10,000 men under her charge, and the general superintendence 
of all the hospitals on the Bosporus. Gradually the effects of 
the measures adopted were seen in a lowered death-rate. In 
February 1855 it was as high as 42%, before many months it had 
sunk to 2. For a time Miss Nightingale was herself prostrated 
with fever, but she refused to leave her post, and remained at 
Scutari till Turkey was evacuated by the British in July 1856. 
The enthusiasm aroused in England by Miss Nightingale's 
labours was indescribable. A man-of-war was ordered to bring 
her home, and London prepared to give her a triumphant 
reception; but she returned quietly in a French ship, crossed 
to England, and escaped to her country home before the news 
of her return could leak out. The experiences of those terrible 
months permanently affected Miss Nightingale's health, but the 
quiet life she afterwards led was full of usefulness. With the 
j£50,ooo raised in recognition of her services she founded the 
Nightingale Home for training nurses at St Thomas's and King's 
College Hospitals. She also turned her attention to the question 
of army sanitary reform and army hospitals, and to the work 
of the Army Medical College at Chatham. In 1858 she published 
her Notes on Nursing, which gave an enormous stimulus to the 
study of this subject in England. According to Miss Nightingale 
nursing ought to signify the proper use of fresh air, light, warmth, 
cleanliness, quiet, and the selection and administration of diet — 
all at the least expense of vital force to the patient. 

Miss Nightingale followed with interest all the later improve- 
ments in sanitation, and was frequently consulted about hospital 
plans both at home and abroad. With the help of the County 
Council Technical Instruction Committee she organized in 1^92 
a health crusade in Buckinghamshire. Teachers were sent 
round among the cottagers to give practical advice on such 
points as ventilation, drainage, disinfectants, cleanliness, &c, 
a plan which, if widely carried out, would bring the most valuable 
knowledge to every home in England. She is understood to have 
drawn up a confidential report for the government on the working 
of the Army Medical Corps in the Crimea, and to have been 
officially consulted during the American Civil War and the 
Franco-German War. In 1007 she received the Order of Merit 
from King Edward VII. She died in London on the 13th of 
August 1910. She is the subject of a beautiful poem by 
Longfellow, " Santa Filomena," and the popular estimate of 
her character and mission was summed up in a particularly 
felicitous anagram, Flit on, cheering angel. 


NIGHTINGALE (O. Eng. Nihtegale, literally "singer of the 
night "), the bird celebrated beyond ali others by European 
writers for the admirable vocal powers which, during some weeks 
after its return from its winter-quarters in the south, it exercises 
at all hours of the day and night. The song itself is indescribable, 
though several attempts, from the time of Aristophanes to the 
present, have been made to express in syllables the sound of its 
many notes. Poets have descanted on the bird (which they 
nearly always make of the feminine gender) leaning its breast 
against a thorn and pouring forth its melody in anguish. But 
the cock alone sings, and there is no reason to suppose that the 
cause and intent of his song differ in any respect from those of 
other birds' songs (see Song). In great contrast to the nightin- 
gale's pre-eminent voice is the inconspicuous coloration of its 
plumage, which is alike in both sexes, and is of a reddish-brown 
above and dull greyish-white beneath, the breast being rather 
darker, and the rufous tail showing the only bright tint. 

The range of the European nightingale, Daidias luscinia, is 
peculiar. In Great Britain it is abundant in suitable localities 
to the south-east of a line stretching from the valley of the Exe, 
in Devonshire, to York, but it does not visit Ireland, its occur- 
rence in Wales is doubtful or intermittent, and it is extremely 
improbable that it has ever reached Scotland. On the continent 
of Europe it does not occur north of a line stretching irregularly 
from Copenhagen to the northern Urals, and it is absent in 
Brittany; over south Europe otherwise it is abundant. It 
reaches Persia, and is a winter visitor to Arabia, Nubia, Abyssinia, 
Algeria and as far south as the Gold Coast. The larger eastern 
D. philomela, sometimes called the thrush-nightingale or Sprosser 
of German bird-catchers, is russet-brown in both sexes, and is 
a native of eastern Europe. D. hafizi of Persia, a true nightingale, 
is probably the Perso-Arabic bulbul of poets. 

The nightingale reaches its English home about the middle 
of April, 1 the males (as is usual among migratory birds) arriving 
some days before the females. On the cocks being joined by 
their partners, the work for which the long and hazardous journey 
of both has been undertaken is speedily begun, and before long 
the nest is completed. This is of a rather uncommon kind, being 
placed on or near the ground, the outworks consisting chiefly 
of a great number of dead leaves ingeniously applied together 
so that the plane of each is mostly vertical. In the midst of the 
mass is wrought a deep cup-like hollow, neatly lined with fibrous 
roots, but the whole is so loosely constructed, and depends for 
lateral support so much on the stems of the plants, among which 
it is generally built, that a very slight touch disturbs its beautiful 
arrangement. Herein from four to six eggs of a deep olive colour 
are duly laid, and the young hatched. The nestling plumage of 
the nightingale differs much from that of the adult, the feathers 
above being tipped with a buff spot, just as in the young of the 
redbreast, hedge-sparrow and ■ redstart, thereby showing the 
natural affinity of all these forms. Towards the end of summer 
the nightingale disappears to its African winter haunts. 

_ The name nightingale has been vaguely applied to several other 
birds. The so-called "Virginian nightingale ' is a species of gros- 
beak (q.v.); the " Pekin nightingale" or "Japanese nightingale" 
is a small babbler (Liothrix luteus) inhabiting the Himalayas and 
China, not Japan at all. 

The nightingale holds a place in classical mythology. Procne 
and Philomela were the daughters of Pandion, lang of Attica, who 
in return for warlike aid rendered him by Tereus, king of Daulis in 
Thrace, gave him the first-named in marriage. Tereus, however, 
being enamoured of her sister, feigned that his wife was dead, and 
induced Philomela to take her place. On her discovering the truth 
he cut out her tongue to hinder her from revealing his deceit; but 
she depicted her sad story on a robe which she sent to Procne; and 
the two sistere then contrived a horrible revenge for the infidelity 
of Tereus, by killing and serving to him at table his son Itys. There- 
upon the gods interposed, changing Tereus into a hoopoe, Procne 
into a swallow, and Philomela into a nightingale, while Itys was 
restored to life as a pheasant, and Pandion (who had died of grief at 
his daughters' dishonour) as a bird of prey (see Osprey). The fable 
has several variants. Ovid's version may be seen in the 6th book of 
his Metamorphoses (lines 412-676). (A. N.) 


NIGHTSHADE, a general term for the genus of plants known 
to botanists as Solanum. The species to which the name of 
nightshade Is commonly given in England is Solanum Dulcamara 
which is also called bittersweet or woody nightshade (see fig. 1). 
It is a common plant in damp hedgebanks and thickets, scram- 
bling over underwood and hedges. It has slender slightly woody 
stems, with alternate lanceolate leaves more or less heart-shaped 
and auriculate at the base. The flowers are arranged in drooping 
clusters and resemble those of the potato in shape, although 

	1 Poets and novelists are apt to command at will the song of this 
	bird, irrespective of season. If the appearance of truth is to be 
	regarded, it is dangerous to introduce a nightingale as singing in 
	England before the 15th of April or after the 15th of June. The 
	11 early nightingale " of newspaper paragraphs is generally a thrush. 

much smaller. The flower clusters spring from the stems at the 
side of, or opposite to, the insertion of a leaf. The corolla is 
rotate, of a lilac-blue colour with a green spot at the base of each 
segment, or sometimes white, and bears the yellow sessile anthers 
united at their margins so as  to form a cone in the centre of 
the flower. The flowers are succeeded by ovate scarlet berries, 
§ in. long, which in large doses appear to be poisonous or, to 
say the least, dangerous to children, cases of poisoning by 
them having occurred. Solatium Dulcamara is subject to the 
same parasitic fungus (Phytophthora infestans) as the 
potato, and

communicating 
the spores to the potato if not removed from the hedges of 
the fields where potatoes are grown. The plant derives its 
names of " bittersweet " and Dulcamara from the fact that its 
taste is at first bitter and then sweet. It is a native of 
Europe, North Africa and temperate Asia, and has 
been introduced into North America. The dried young 
branches are known in pharmacy under the name dulcamara. 

Dulcamara contains a bitter principle yielding by decomposition 
a sugar dextrose and the alkaloid solanine. It also conta ins another 
glucoside dulcamarin, which when boiled with dilute acid splits up into 
sugar and dulcamaretin. Solanine appears to exert a  depressant action on 
the vagus nerve and an excitant action on the medulla oblongata.

mora in having white 
flowers in small umbels and globose black berries. 
It is a common weed in 
gardens and waste places, growing about 12 or 18 in. high, and has 
ovate, entire or sinuate or toothed leaves. Two varieties of the 
plant, one with red and the other with yellow berries, are sometimes 
met with, but are comparatively rare. The berries have been known 
to produce poisonous effects when eaten by children, and owe their 
properties to the presence of solanine. In Reunion and Mauritius the 
leaves are eaten like spinach. 

Deadly nightshade, dwale or belladonna (Atropa belladonna) 
is a tall bushy herb of the same natural order (fig. 2). It grows 
to a height of 4 or 5 ft., having leaves of a dull green colour, 
with a black shining berry fruit about the size of a cherry, and a 
large tapering root. The plant is a native of central and south 
Europe, extending into Asia, and is found locally in England, 
chiefly on chalk and limestone, from Westmorland and south- 
wards. The entire plant is highly poisonous, and accidents not 
infrequently occur through children and unwary persons eating 
the attractive-looking fruit. Its leaves and roots are largely 
used in medicine, on which account the plant is cultivated, chiefly 
in south Germany, Switzerland and France (see Belladonna). 

The name nightshade is applied to plants of different genera in 
other countries. American mgntshade is Phytolacca decandra (poke- 
weed, 2.v.). The three-leaved nightshade is an American species of 
Trillium. The Malabar nightshade is Basclla, which is widely used 
as a pot-herb in India. Enchanter's nightshade is Circaea luteliana* 
a small, glandular, softly-hairy plant, common in damp woods, 
with slender, erect or ascending stems, paired ovate leaves with long 
stalks, and small white flowers in terminal racemes, succeeded by a 
small fruit covered with hooked bristles; it is a member of the 
natural order Onagraceae, and is not known to possess any 
poisonous property ; the name seems to have been given to it 
in the first place in mistake for a species of Mandragora (see 
Mandrake). 


NIGRA, COSTANTINO, Count (1828-1907), Italian diplo- 
matist, was born at Villa Castelnuovo, in the province of Turin, 
on the nth of June 1828. During the war of 1848 he interrupted 
his studies to serve as a volunteer against Austria, and was 
wounded at the battle of Rivoli. On the conclusion of peace he 
entered the Piedmontese foreign office; he accompanied Victor 
Emmanuel and Cavour to Paris and London in 1855, and in the 
following year he took part in the conference of Paris by which 
the Crimean War was brought to an end. After the meeting at 
Plombieres between Cavour and Napoleon III. Nigra was sent 
to Paris again to popularize a Franco-Piedmontese alliance, 
Nigra being, as Cavour said, " the only person perhaps who knows 
all my thoughts, even the most secret." He was instrumental 
in negotiating the marriage between Victor Emmanuel's daughter 
Clothilde and Napoleon's nephew, and during the war of 1859 
he was always with the emperor. He was recalled from Paris 
when the occupation of the Marche and Umbria by the Pied- 
montese caused a breach in Franco-Italian relations, and was 
appointed secretary of state to the prince of Carignano, viceroy 
of the Neapolitan provinces. When Napoleon recognized the 
kingdom of Italy in 1861, Nigra returned to France as minister- 
resident, and for many years played a most important part in 
political affairs. In 1876 he was transferred to St Petersburg with 
the rank of ambassador, in 1882 to London, and in 1885 to Vienna. 
In 1899 he represented Italy at the first Hague Peace Conference. 
In 1904 he retired, and he died at Rapallo on the 1st of July 
1907. He was created count in 1882 and senator in 1890. Nigra 
was a sound classical scholar, and published translations of many 
Greek and Latin poems with valuable comments; he was also 
a poet and the author of several works of folk-lore and popular 
poetry, of which the most important is his Canti popolari del 
Piemonte. 


NIHILISM, the name commonly given to the Russian form of 
revolutionary Socialism, which had at first an academical 
character, and rapidly developed into an anarchist revolutionary 
movement. It originated in the early years of the reign of 
Alexander II., and the term was first used by Turgueniev in his 
celebrated novel, Fathers and Children,- published in 1862. 
Among the students of the universities and the higher technical 
schools Turgueniev had noticed a new and strikingly original 
type — young men and women in slovenly attire, who called in 
question and ridiculed the generally received convictions and 
respectable conventionalities of social life, and who talked of 
reorganizing society on strictly scientific principles. They 
reversed the traditional order of things even in trivial matters 
of external appearance, the males allowing the hair to grow long 
and the female adepts cutting it short, and adding sometimes the 
additional badge of blue spectacles. Their appearance, manners 
and conversation were apt to shock ordinary people, but to this 
they were profoundly indifferent, for they had raised themselves 
above the level of so-called public opinion, despised Philistine 
respectability, and rather liked to scandalize people still under the 
influence of what they considered antiquated prejudices. For 
aesthetic culture, sentimentalism and refinement of every kind 
they had a profound and undisguised contempt. Professing 
extreme utilitarianism and delighting in paradox, they were 
ready to declare that a shoemaker who distinguished himself in 
his craft was a greater man than a Shakespeare or a Goethe, 
because humanity had more need of shoes than of poetry. 
Thanks to Turgueniev, these young persons came to be known 
in common parlance as " Nihilists," though they never ceased 
to protest against the term as a caluminous nickname. According 
to their own account, they were simply earnest students who 
desired reasonable reforms, and the peculiarities in their appear- 
ance and manner arose simply from an excusable neglect of 
trivialities in view of graver interests. In reality, whatever 
name we may apply to them, they were the extreme repre- 
sentatives of a curious moral awakening and an important 
intellectual movement among the Russian educated classes (see 
Alexander II., of Russia). 

In material and moral progress Russia had remained behind 
the other European nations, and the educated classes felt, after 
the humiliation of the Crimean War, that the reactionary regime 
of the emperor Nicholas must be replaced by a series of drastic 
reforms. With the impulsiveness of youth and the recklessness of 
inexperience, the students went in this direction much farther than 
their elders, and their reforming zeal naturally took an academic, 
pseudo-scientific form. Having learned the rudiments of 
positivism, they conceived the idea that Russia had outlived 
the religious and metaphysical stages of human development, 
and was ready to enter on the positivist stage. She ought, 
therefore, to throw aside all religious and metaphysical con- 
ceptions, and to regulate her intellectual, social and political 
life by the pure light of natural science. Among the antiquated 
institutions which had to be abolished as obstructions to real 
progress, were religion, family life, private property and central- 
ized administration. Religion was to be replaced by the exact 
sciences, family life by free love, private property by collectivism, 
and centralized administration by a federation of independent 
communes. Such doctrines could not, of course, be preached 
openly under a paternal, despotic government, but the press 
censure had become so permeated with the prevailing spirit of 
enthusiastic liberalism, that they could be artfully disseminated 
under the disguise of literary criticism and fiction, and the public 
very soon learned the art of reading between the lines. The work 
which had perhaps the greatest influence in popularizing the 
doctrines was a novel called Shto Dyelati? (What is to be done?),- 
written in prison by Tchernishevski, one of the academic 
leaders of the movement, and published with the sanction of the 
authorities! 

Since the time of Peter the Great, Russia had been subjected 
to a wonderful serie*s of administrative and social transformations, 
and it seemed to many people quite natural that another great 
transformation might be effected with the consent and co- 
operation of the autocratic power. The doctrines spread, there- 
fore, with marvellous rapidity. In the winter of 1 861-186 2 a 
high official wrote to a friend who had been ahsent from Russia 
for a few months: " If you returned now you would be astonished 
at the progress which the opposition — one might say, the 
revolutionary party — has made. . . . The revolutionary ideas 
have taken possession of all classes, all ages, all professions, and 
they are publicly expressed in the streets, in the barracks, and in 
the government offices. I believe the police itself is carried away 
by them." Certainly the government was under the influence of 
the prevailing enthusiasm for reform, for it liberated all the 
serfs, endowed them liberally with arable land, and made their 
democratic communal institutions independent of the landed 
proprietors; and it was preparing other important reforms in a 
similar spirit, including the extension of self-government in the 
rural districts and the towns, and the reorganization of the 
antiquated judicial system and procedure according to the 
modern principles adopted in western Europe. 

The programme of the government was extensive enough and 
liberal enough to satisfy, for the moment at least, all reason- 
able reformers, but the well-intentioned, self-confident young 
people to whom the term Nihilists was applied were not reason- 
able. They wanted an immediate, thorough-going transforma- 
tion of the existing order of things according to the most advanced 
socialistic principles, and in their youthful, reckless impatience 
they determined to undertake the work themselves, indepen- 
dently of and in opposition to the government. As they bad no 
means of seizing the central power, they adopted the method of 
endeavouring to bring about the desired political, social and 
economic changes by converting the masses to their views. 
They began, therefore, a propaganda among the working popula- 
tion of the towns and the rural population in the villages. The 
propagandists were recruited chiefly from the faculty of physical 
science in the universities, from the Technological Institute, 
and from the medical schools, and a female contingent was 
supplied by the midwifery classes of the Medico-Surgical 
Academy. Those of each locality were personally known to each 
other, but there was no attempt to estahlish among them 
hierarchical distinctions or discipline. Each individual bad 
entire freedom as to the kind and means of propaganda to be" 
employed. Some disguised themselves as artisans or ordinary 
labourers, and sought to convert their uneducated fellow- 
workmen in the industrial centres, whilst others settled in the 
villages as school-teachers, and endeavoured to stir up dis- 
affection among the recently emancipated peasantry by telling 
them that the tsar intended they should have all the land, and 
that his benevolent intentions had been frustrated by the selfish 
landed proprietors and the dishonest officials. Landed pro- 
prietors and officials, it was suggested, should be got rid of, and 
then the peasants would have arable, pastoral and forest land 
in abundance, and would not require to pay any taxes. To 
persons of a certain education the agitators sought to prove 
that the general economic situation was desperate, that it was 
the duty of every conscientious citizen to help the people in such 
a dilemma, and that the first step towards the attainment of 
this devoutly to be wished consummation was the limitation 
or destruction of the uncontrolled supreme power. On the whole 
the agitators had very little success, and not a few of them fell 
into the hands of the police, several of them being denounced 
to the authorities by the persons in whose interest they professed 
to be acting; but the great majority were so obstinate and so 
ready to make any personal sacrifices, that the arrest and punish- 
ment of some of their number did not deter others from con- 
tinuing the work. Between 1861 and 1864 there were no less 
than twenty political trials, with the result that most of the 
accused were condemned to imprisonment, or to compulsory 
residence in small provincial towns under police supervision. 

The activity of the police naturally produced an ever-increas- 
ing hostility to the government, and in 1866 this feeling took a 
practical form in an attempt on the part of an ohscure individual 
called Karakozov to assassinate the emperor. Tbe attempt failed, 
and the judicial inquiry proved that it was the work of merely 
a few individuals, but it showed the dangerous character of the 
movement, and it induced the authorities to take more energetic 
measures. For the next four years there was an apparent 
lull, during which only one political trial took place, but it was 
subsequently proved that the Nihilists during this time were 
by no means inactive. An energetic agitator called Netchaiev 
organized in 1869 a secret association under the title of the 
Society for the Liberation of the People, and when he suspected 
of treachery one of the members he caused him to be assassinated. 
This crime led to the arrest of some members of the society, but 
their punishment had very little deterrent effect on the Nihilists in 
general, for during the next few years there was a recrudescence 
of the propaganda among the labouring classes. Independent 
circles were created and provided with secret printing-presses in 
many of the leading provincial towns — notably in Moscow, 
Nijni-Novgorod, Penza, Samara, Saratov, Kharkof, Kiev, 
Odessa, Rostov-on-the-Don and Taganrog; and closer relations 
were established with the revolutionary Socialists in western 
Europe, especially with the followers of Bakunin, who considered 
that a great popular rising should be brought about in Russia as 
soon as possible. Bakunin's views did not, it is true, obtain 
unanimous acceptance. Some of the Nihilists maintained that 
things were not yet ripe for a rising of the masses, that the pacific 
propaganda must be continued for a considerable time, and that 
before attempting to overthrow the existing social organization 
some idea should be formed as to the order of things which 
should take its place. The majority, however, were too im- 
patient for action to listen to such counsels of prudence, and 
when they encountered opposition on the part of the govern- 
ment they urged the necessity of retaliating by acts of terrorism. 
In a brochure issued in 1874 one of the most influential leaders 
(Tkatchev) explained that the object of the revolutionary party 
should be, not the preparation of revolution in general, but the 
realization of it at the earliest possible moment, that it was a 
mistake to attach great importance to questions of future social 
organization, and that all the energies of the party should be 
devoted to " a struggle with the government and the established 
order of things, a struggle to the last drop of blood and to the last 
breath." In accordance with the fashionable doctrine of evolu- 
tion, the reconstruction of society on the tabula rasa might be left, 
it was thought, to the spontaneous action of natural forces, or, 
to use a Baconian phrase, to natura naturans. 

To this and similar declarations of irreconcilable hostility 
the government replied by numerous arrests, and in the winter of 
1877-1878 no less than 193 agitators, selected from 2000 arrested 
on suspicion, were tried publicly in St Petersburg by a tribunal 
specially constituted for the purpose. Nearly all of them were 
condemned to imprisonment or exile, and the revolutionary 
organization in the northern provinces was thereby momentarily 
paralysed, but a few energetic leaders who had escaped arrest 
reorganized their scattered forces and began the work anew. 
They constituted themselves into a secret executive Committee, 
which endeavoured to keep in touch with, and partially direct, 
the independent groups in the provincial towns. Though they 
never succeeded in creating an efficient centralized administra- 
tion, they contrived to give to the movement the appearance of 
united action by assuming the responsibility for terrorist crimes 
committed by persons who were in reality not acting under 
their orders. During the years 1878, 1879 and 1880 these 
terrorist crimes were of frequent occurrence. General Trepov, 
prefect of St Petersburg, was shot by Vera Zasulitch under 
pretence of presenting a petition to him; General Mezentsov, 
chief of the political police, was assassinated in broad daylight 
in one of the principal streets of St Petersburg, and an attempt 
was afterwards made on the life of his successor, General 
Drenteln; Prince Krapotkin, governor of the province of 
Kharkof, was assassinated for having introduced stricter prison 
discipline with regard to political prisoners; a murderous attack 
was made on the emperor in front of the Winter Palace by an 
ex-student called Soloviev; repeated attempts were made to 
blow up the train conveying the Imperial family from the 
Crimea to St Petersburg; and a dynamite explosion, by which 
ten people were killed and thirty-four wounded, took place in 
the Winter Palace, the Imperial family owing their escape to the 
accident of not sitting down to dinner punctually at the usual 
hour. Assassination was used also by the agitators against 
confederates suspected of giving information to the police, and a 
number of gendarmes were murdered when effecting arrests: 
After each of these crimes a proclamation was issued by the 
executive committee explaining the motives and accepting the 
responsibility. 

When repressive measures and the efforts of the police were 
found insufficient to cope with the evil, Alexander II. deter- 
mined to try a new system. Count Loris Melikof was entrusted 
with semi-dictatorial powers, relaxed the severity of the police 
r6gime, and endeavoured to obtain the support of all loyal 
Liberals by holding out the prospect of a series of reforms in a 
liberal sense. His conciliatory methods failed signally, and were 
repaid by an attack on his life. A semblance of parliamentary 
institutions was not what the Anarchists wanted. They simply 
redoubled their activity, and hatched a plot for the assassination 
of the emperor. In March 188 1 the plot was successful. Alex- 
ander II., when driving in St Petersburg, was mortally wounded 
by the explosion of small bombs, and died almost as soon as he 
had reached the Winter Palace. On the following day the 
executive committee issued a bombastic proclamation, in which it 
declared triumphantly that the tsar had been condemned to 
death by a secret tribunal on 26th August 1879, and that two years 
of effort and painful losses had at last been crowned with success. 
These facts put an end to the policy of killing Anarchism by 
kindness, and one of the first acts of the new reign was a manifesto 
in which Alexander III. announced very plainly that he had no 
intention of limiting the autocratic power, or making concessions 
of any kind to the revolutionary party. The subsequent history 
of the movement presents little that is interesting or original, 
merely a continual but gradually subsiding effort to provoke 
local disturbances with a view to bringing about sooner or 
later a general rising of the masses and the overthrow not only 
of the government, but also of the existing social and economic 
regime. A serious manifestation on the part of the terrorists 
took the shape of a plot to assassinate the emperor by bombs 
in the streets of St Petersburg in March 1887. It was the work 
of a very small group, the members of which were being watched 
by the police, and were all arrested on the day when the crime 
was to be perpetrated. The movement afterwards showed 
occasionally signs of revival. In 1001, for example, there were 
troubles in the universities, and in 1902 there were serious 
disturbances among the peasantry in some of the central rural 
districts; and the assassination of M. Sipiaguine, the minister 
of the interior, was a disquieting incident; but the illusions and 
enthusiasm which produced Nihilism in the young generation 
during the early years of the reign of Alexander II. had been 
largely shattered and dispelled by experience. The revolutionary 
propaganda temporarily led to a serious situation in the early 
years of the reign of Tsar Nicholas II., but a new era opened for 
Russia with the inauguration of parliamentary government. 

The following criminal statistics of the movement during six 
and a half years of its greatest activity (from 1st July 1881 to 1st 
January 1888) are taken from unpublished official records. — 

	Number of affairs examined in the police department 1500 
	Number of persons punished 3046 
	These 3046 punishments may be divided into the following 
	categories : — 
	Death 20 
	Penal servitude 128 
	Exile in Siberia 681 
	Exile under police supervision in European Russia . 1500 
	Lesser punishments 717 
	3046 

From the beginning of the movement up to 1902 the number 
of Anarchists condemned to death and executed was forty-eight, 
and the number of ^ persons assassinated by the Anarchists was 
thirty-nine. There is no reason to suspect the accuracy of these 
statistics, for they were not intended tor publication. They are 
taken from a confidential memorandum presented to the emperor.

NIIGATA, the chief town of the province of Echigo, Japan. 
Pop. (1903) 58,821. It lies on the west coast of the island of 
Nippon, on a narrow strip of sandy ground between the left bank 
of the Shinano and the sea, which though close at hand is shut 
out from view by a low' range of sandhills. It occupies an area 
of rather more than 1 sq. m., and consists of five long parallel 
streets intersected by cross-streets, which in most cases have 
canals running down the middle and communicating with the 
river, so that the internal traffic of the city is mainly carried 
on by water. The houses are usually built with gables to the 
street, and roofs and verandas project so as to keep the windows 
and footpaths from being blocked up by the heavy winter snows. 
Niigata was originally chosen as one of the five open ports — 
Nagasaki, Kobe, Yokohama, Niigata and Hakodate — but it 
failed, chiefly owing to a bar which prevents the entry of vessels 
of any size. The town has been brought within the railway 
circuit, and the production of petroleum has been developed in 
the district. Ebisa, on the island of Sado, was opened as a 
supplementary harbour of refuge, but not as a trading port. 
There is a large manufacture of lacquer-ware in the town. 
The foreign trade is entirely in the hands of Japanese merchants. 
During winter Niigata suffers from a terribly severe climate; 
the summers, moreover, are excessively hot. 


NIJAR, a town of south-eastern Spain, in the province of 
Almeria; on the southern slope of the Sierra Alhamilla, and 
on the small river Artal, which flows into the Mediterranean Sea 
6 m. S.W. Pop. (1900) 12,497. Diespite the lack of railway 
communication, Nijar is a place of some commercial importance. 
Lead, iron and manganese are mined in the neighbouring moun- 
tains; the fertile plain watered by the Artal yields an abundance 
of wheat, fruit, olives and esparto grass; and fine porcelain and 
woollen and cotton goods are manufactured in the town. 


NIJMWEGEN, Nimeguen, Nymegen or Nimwegen, a town 
in the province of Gelderland, Holland, on the left bank of the 
Waal, 24! m. by rail E. by S. of Tiel. It has regular steamboat 
communication with Rotterdam, Cologne and Arnhem, and steam- 
tramways connect it with the popular resorts of Neerbosi. \ ' 
Beek and Berg -en -Dal in the vicinity. Pop. (1904) 49,342. 
Nijmwegen is very prettily 'situated on the slopes of five low 
hills rising from the river-side. It stands up with a boldness quite 
unusual in a Dutch town, and steps are even necessary to lead 
to the higher portions of the town. In 1877-1884 the old town 
walls were demolished, a promenade and gardens taking their 
place, and since then a new quarter has grown up on the south 
side with a fine open place called the Emperor Charles's Plain. 
On the east of the town is the beautiful park called the Valkhof, 
which marks the site of the old palace of the Carolingian emperors. 
The palace was still inhabitable in 1787, but was ruined by the 
French bombardment of 1794, and only two portions of it 
remain. These are a part of the choir of the 12th-century palace- 
church, and a sixteen-sided baptistry originally consecrated 
by Pope Leo III. in 799 and rebuilt in the 1 2th or 13th century. 
Close by is the lofty tower of the Belvedere, dating from 1646. 
The Groote Kerk of St Stephen forms with its tall square tower 
one of the most striking features in the general views of the town. 
Originally built about 1272, it dates in its present condition 
mainly from the 15th and 16th centuries. In the choir is the 
fine monument of Catherine of Bourbon (d. 1469), wife of 
Adolphus of Egmont, duke of Gelderland, with a brass of the 
duchess, and the heraldic achievements of the house of Bourbon. 
There is also a fine organ. The interesting Renaissance town- 
hall was built in 1554 (restored in 1879). It is adorned with the 
effigies of kings and emperors who were once benefactors of 
Nijmwegen. Inside are to be found some fine wood-carving, 
tapestries, pictures and a cumbrous safe in which the town 
charters were so jealously preserved that the garrison used to be 
called out and the city gates closed whenever they were con- 
sulted. There is also an interesting museum of antiquities. 
Other buildings of note are the theatre (1839), the Protestant 
hospital, the Roman Catholic or Canisius hospital (1866), and the 
old weigh-house and Flesher's Hall, probably built in 161 2 and 
restored in 1885. Between 1656 and 1678 Nijmwegen was the 
seat of a university. Beer, Prussian blue, leather, tin, pottery, 
cigars, and gold and silver work are the chief industrial products, 
and there is a considerable trade by rail and river. 


NIKAYA (" collection ")> tne name of a division of the Bud- 
dhist canonical books. There are four principal Nikayas, making 
together the Sutta Pitaka (" Basket of Discourses "), the second 
of the three baskets into which the canon is divided. The fifth or 
miscellaneous Nikaya is by some authorities added to this Pitaka, 
by others to the next. The first two Nikayas, called respectively 
Digk'a and Majjhima (Longer and Shorter), form one book, a 
collection of the dialogues of the Buddha, the longer ones being 
included in the former, the shorter ones in the latter. The third, 
called the Anguttara (Progressive Addition), rearranges the 
doctrinal matter contained in the Dialogues in groups of ethical 
concepts, beginning with the units, then giving the pairs, then the 
groups of three, four, five, &c, up to ten. In the Dialogues the 
arrangement in such numbered groups is frequent. In an age 
when books, in our modern sense, were unknown, it was a 
practical necessity to invent and use aids to memory. Such were 
the repetition of memorial tags, of cues (as now used for a pre- 
cisely similar purpose on the stage), to suggest what is to come. 
Such were also these numbered lists of technical ethical terms. 
Religious teachers in the West had similar groups — the seven 
deadly sins, the ten commandments, the four cardinal virtues, 
the seven Sacraments, and many others. These are only now, 
since the gradual increase of books, falling out of use. In the 
5th century B.C. in India it was found convenient by the early 
Buddhists to classify almost the whole of their psychology and 
ethics in this manner. And the Anguttara Nikaya is based on 
that classification. In the last Nikaya, the Samyutta (The 
Clusters), the same doctrines are arranged in a different set of 
groups, according to subject. All the Logia (usually of the master 
himself, but also of his principal disciples) on any one point, 
or in a few cases as addressed to one set of people, are here 
brought together. That was, of course, a very convenient 
arrangement then. It saved a teacher or scholar who wanted to 
find the doctrine on any one subject from the trouble of repeating 
over, or getting some one else to repeat over for him, the whole 
of the Dialogues or the Anguttara. To us, now, the Samyutta 
seems full of repetitions; and we are apt to forget that they are 
there for a very good reason. 

During the time when the canon was being completed there 
was great activity in learning, repeating to oneself, rehearsing 
in company and discussing these three collections. But there 
was also considerable activity in a more literary direction. 
Hymns were sung, lyrics were composed, tales were told, the 
results of some exciting or interesting talk were preserved in 
summaries of exegetical exposition. A number of these have 
been fortunately preserved for us in twenty-two collections, 
mostly of very short pieces, in the fifth or miscellaneous Nikaya, 
the Khuddaka Nikaya. 

The text of the Dialogues fills about 2000 pages 8vo in the edition 
prepared for the Pali Text Society, of which five vols, out of six 
had been published in 1909, and the first had been translated into 
English. The Samyutta, of about the same size, and the Anguttara, 
which is a little smaller, have both been edited. Of the twenty-two 
miscellaneous books twenty have been edited (see Rhys Davids, 
American Lectures (1896), pp. 66-79), nve have been translated into 
English and two more into German.

NIKE, in Greek mythology, the goddess of victory (Gr. vlmj). 
She does not appear personified in Homer; in Hesiod (Theog. 
384) she is the daughter of the giant Pallas and Styx, and is sent 
to fight on the side of Zeus against the Titans. Nike does not 
appear to have been the object of a separate cult at Athens. 
She was at first inseparably connected and confounded with 
Pallas Athena, the dispenser of victory, but gradually separated 
from her. As an attribute of both Athena and Zeus she is repre- 
sented as a small figure carried by those divinities in their hand. 
Athena Nike was always wingless, Nike as a separate goddess 
winged. In works of art she appears carrying a palm branch 
or a wreath (sometimes a Hermes staff as the messenger of 
victory) ; erecting a trophy or recording a victory on a shield ; 
frequently hovering with outspread wings over the victor in a 
competition, since her functions referred not only to success in 
war, but to all other human undertakings. In fact, Nike gradu- 
ally came to be recognized as a sort of mediator of success between 
gods and men. 

At Rome the goddess of victory (Victoria) was worshipped 
from the earliest times. Evander was said to have erected a 
temple in her honour on the Palatine before the foundation of 
Rome itself (Dion. Halic. i. 32, 33). With the introduction of the 
Greek gods, Victoria became merged in Nike. She always had a 
firm hold over the Roman mind, and her popularity lasted till 
the end of paganism. Special games were held in her honour 
in the circus, and generals erected statues of her after a successful 
campaign. She came to be regarded as the protecting goddess 
of the senate, and her statue (originally brought from Tarentum 
and set up by Augustus in memory of the battle of Actium) in 
the Curia Julia (Dio Cassius li. 22; Suetonius, Aug. 100) was 
the cause of the final combat between Christianity and paganism 
towards the end of the 4th century. Victoria had altars in 
camp, a special set of worshippers and colleges, a festival on the 
1st of November, temples at Rome and throughout the empire. 
The Sabine goddess Vicuna and Vica Pota, one of the dii indigetes 
(both of them goddesses of victory), are earlier varieties of Vic- 
toria (Livy xxix. 14). Representations of Nike-Victoria in 
Greek and Graeco-Roman art are very numerous. The statue of 
Nike at Olympia by Paeonius has been in great part recovered. 

See A. Baudrillart, Les DiviniUs de la vicioire en Grece et en Italie 
(1894), whose view that in the 5th century Nike became detached 
from Athena, although Athena Nike still continued to exist, is 
supported by Miss J. E. Harrison {Classical Review, April 1895) 
and L. R. Farnell {Cults of the Greek States, i., 1896), butopposcd by 
E. Sikes {C.R., June 1895), who holds that *' while Nike was a late 
conception, Athena Nike was still later, and that the goddess of, 
victory cannot have originated, either at Athens or elsewhere, 
from an aspect of Athena " ; F. Studniczka, Die Siegesgottin (Leipzig,

NIKISCH, ARTHUR (1855-- ), Hungarian conductor, 
became known as .a musical prodigy at an early age, making a 
public performance as a pianist at eight years old. He studied 
at the Vienna Conservatoire from 1866 to 1873, and while there 
he composed a symphony and other works. For a time he was 
engaged as a violinist, but in 1877 he began as assistant conductor 
at the Leipzig opera and two years later became chief conductor. 
His success there, and his reputation as the producer of the 
more modern types of music as well as of classical masterpieces 
led to his being appointed conductor of the symphony orchestra 
at Boston, U.S.A., from 1880. to 1893; and subsequently, after 
having been director at the Budapest opera, he was made 
conductor at the Leipzig Gewandhaus. His fame was now wide- 
spread, and he made successful visits to London, Paris and other 
capitals, his ability as a pianoforte accompanist being recog- 
nized as no less marked than his brilliance as director of an 
orchestra. 


NIKITIN, ATHANASIUS, of Tver (fl. 1468-1474), Russian 
merchant, traveller and writer, the earliest known Russian visitor 
to India. He started in 1468 on his " wanderings beyond the 
Three Seas " (Caspian, Euxine and Indian Ocean), and descended 
the Volga, passing by Uglich, Kostroma, Nizhniy Novgorod, 
Kazan, Sarai and Astrakhan. Near the latter he was attacked 
and robbed by Tatars; but he succeeded in reaching Derbent, 
where he joined Vasili Papin, the envoy of Ivan III. of Moscow 
to the shah of Shirvan; from Nizhniy Novgorod he had travelled 
with Hasan Bey, the Shirvan shah's ambassador, returning to his 
master with a present of falcons from Ivan. At Derbent Nikitin 
vainly endeavoured to get means of returning to Russia; failing 
in this, he went on to Batu, where he notices the " eternal fires," 
and thence over the Caspian to Bokhara. Here he stayed six 
months, after which he made his way southward, with several 
prolonged stoppages, to the Persian Gulf, through Mazandaran 
province and the towns of Amul, Demavend, Ray (near Tehran), 
Kashan, Nain, Yezd, Sirjan, Tarun, Lar and Bandar, opposite 
New (or insular) Hormuz. From Hormuz he sailed by Muscat to 
Gujarat, Cambay and Chaul in western India. Landing at Chaul, 
he seems to have travelled to Umrut in Aurangabad province, 
south-east of Surat, and thence to Beder, the modern Ahmedabad. 
Here, andin adjacent regions, Nikitin spent nearly four years; 
from the little he tells us, he appears to have made his living by 
horse-dealing. From Beder he visited the Hindu sanctuary 
(" their Jerusalem ") of Perwattum. He returned to Russia by 
way of Calicut, Dabul, Muscat, Hormuz, Lar, Shiraz, Yezd, 
Isfahan, Kashan, Sultanieh, Tabriz, Trebizond and Kaffa 
(Theodosia) in the Crimea. He has left us descriptions of 
western Indian manners, customs, religion, court-ceremonies, 
festivals, warfare and trade, of some value; but the text is 
corrupt, and the narrative at its best is confused and meagre. 
His remarks on the trade of Hormuz, Cambay, Calicut, Dabul, 
Ceylon, Pegu and China; on royal progresses and other functions, 
both ecclesiastical and civil, at Beder; and on the wonders of 
the great fair at Perwattum — as well as his comparisons of things 
Russian and Indian — deserve special notice.

NIKKO, one of the chief religious centres of Japan. The 
name belongs properly to the district, but is as commonly 
applied to the principal village, Hachi-ishi, which is qi m. N. 
Oaf Tokyo by rail. The district is high-lying, mountainous and 
beautiful, and is in favour for summer residence. The chief 
mountain range is known as Nikko-Zan (Mountains of the Sun's 
Brightness). A Shinto temple seems to have existed at Nikko 
from time immemorial, and in 767 its first Buddhist temple was 
founded by Shodo Sho-nin (the subject of many strange legendary 
adventures); but the main celebrity of the place is due to the 
sepulchres and sanctuaries of Iyeyasu and Iyemitsu, the first 
and third shoguns of the Tokugawa dynasty. Iyeyasu was 
buried with amazing pomp in 161 7, and Iyemitsu, his grandson, 
was slain in 1650 while visiting his tomb. From 1644 to 1868 
the " abbots " of Nikko were always princes of the imperial 
blood; thirteen of them are buried within the sacred grounds. 
Though the magnificent abbots' residence was destroyed by fire 
in 1 87 1, and the temples have lost most of their ritual and much 
of their material splendour, enough remains to astonish by 
excellence and bewilder by variety of decorative detail. Of the 
numerous structures which cluster round the shrine of Iyeyasu, 
it is sufficient to mention the cylindrical copper column (1643), 
a guardian against evil influences, 42 ft. high, adorned at the 
top with a series of lotus flowers, from the petals of which hang 
small bells; a five-storied pagoda (1659), 104 ft. high, with the 
signs of the zodiac carved round the base; the gate of the Two 
Kings, with its figures of unicorns, lions, tigers, elephants, 
mythical animals and tree-peonies; the vermilion-coloured 
timber enclosure to which this gate gives entrance, with three 
great storehouses, a sumptuous stable for the sacred horses, and 
a finely fashioned granite cistern (1618) for holy water; and the 
Yo-mci-mon gate, which with the contiguous cloister is covered 
with the most elaborate carving, and gives access by way of 
another gate (Kara-Mon) to the court in the midst of which stands 
the last and most sacred enclosure. This, known as the Tama- 
gakij is a quadrangle of gilt trellis-work 50 yds. square; within it 
stands the " chapel " or oratory (or rather a series of chambers), 
in the decoration of which gilding and black lacquer have been 
lavishly employed. The tomb of Iyeyasu lies apart about two 
hundred steps higher up the hills, in the shadow of tall crypto- 
merias — a single light-coloured bronze urn or casket standing on 
a circular base of three steps with a stone table in front on which 
rest a censer, a lotus-cluster and a stork with a candlestick in its 
mouth, the whole enclosed by a high stone wall. Somewhat similar 
are the tomb of Iyemitsu and its surroundings; and though the 
art displayed is of an inferior character, the profusion of buildings 
and embellishments is even more remarkable. Hotok6 Iwa, the 
hill on which the tomb stands, is completely covered to the summit 
with trees of various tints. There are numerous temples and 
shrines of minor interest in the locality. 


NIKOLAYEV, a town, seaport and chief naval station of 
Russia on the Black Sea, in the government of Kherson, 40 m. 
N.W. of the city of Kherson. Pop. (1881) 35,000; (1891) 
77,210; (1897) 92,060. Nikolayev stands a little above the 
confluence of the Ingul with the Bug, at the head of the litnan, 
or estuary, of the Bug, and is the natural outlet for the basin of 
that river. The estuary, which is 25 m. long, enters that of the 
Dnieper. The entrance to the double estuary is protected by 
the fortress of Ochakov and by the fort of Kinburn, erected on a 
narrow headland opposite, while several forts surround Nikolayev 
on both sides of the Bug and protect it from an attack by land. 
Over the bar at Ochakov the water has been deepened to 25 ft., 
and over the bar of the Dnieper to 20 ft. by dredging. The town, 
which occupies two flat peninsulas between the Bug and the Ingul, 
extends up the banks of the latter, while its suburbs reach still 
farther out into the steppe. The streets are wide, and intersect 
one another at right angles. The bank of the Ingul is taken up 
with shipbuilding yards, docks, slips and various workshops of 
the admiralty for the construction of armour-plates, guns, boilers, 
&c. On the river there is a floating dock for armoured ships. 
Before the Crimean War the activity of the dockyards was very 
great; the suburbs — which belong to the admiralty — were 
bound to supply the necessary hands to the number of 3000 
every day, and all the inhabitants had to perform compulsory 
service. Since 1870 the construction of armoured ships and 
torpedo-boats has been carried on here. From 1893 Nikolayev 
was the chief port for the Russian volunteer fleet, which sailed 
to and fro between this port and Vladivostok until the Russo- 
Japanese War of 1904-05. Nikolayev has steam flour-mills, 
iron and machinery works, saw-mills, soap, tobacco, vinegar, 
carriage and agricultural machinery works. The foreign exports 
consist almost entirely of cereals, especially wheat and rye, 
with a little sugar, iron and manganese ore and oilcake. The 
total value reaches £7,000,000 to £9,000,000 annually. Navi- 
gation is maintained during the whole winter by the aid of a 
powerful ice-breaker. Nikolayev is the chief market for the 
governments of Kherson, Poltava, Kharkov, Ekaterinoslav and 
parts of Kiev, Kursk and Podolia. In addition to the naval 
harbour, there are the harbour of the Russian Steamship 
Company and the coasting harbour, made in 1893; while large 
storehouses stand close to the commercial port, 2 m. from the 
town, at Popovaya-Balka on the Bug. The educational in- 
stitutions include an artillery school, a school of navigation, 
two technical schools, an astronomical and meteorological 
observatory, museums and libraries, and a hydrographical 
institute. Amongst the public buildings, the cathedral, which 
contains some good Italian pictures, the theatre, the artillery 
arsenal, the admiralty and other state buildings are worthy of 
mention. 

The remains of the Greek colony Olbia have been discovered 
close to the confluence of the Ingul with the Bug, 10 m. S. of 
Nikolayev. In medieval times the country was under the 
Lithuanians, and subsequently under the Zaporogian Cossacks. 
Russian colonists settled in the locality about the end of the 
1 8th century, and after the fall of Ochakov, Prince Potemkin 
established (1789) a wharf on the Ingul which received the name 
of Nikolayev. (P. A. K.; J. T. Be.) 


NIKOLAYEVSK, a town of East Siberia, in the Maritime 
province, on the left bank of the Amur, 20 m. above its outflow 
into the Gulf of Amur, in 53° 8' N. Pop. (1897) 8200. It is 
defended by a fort and batteries. Founded in 1851, Nikolayevsk 
was formerly the capital of the Maritime province. 


NIKOLAYEVSK, a town of Russia, in the government of 
Samara, on the right bank of the Irgiz, 40 m. from the Volga 
and 100 m. S.W. of the town of Samara. Pop. (1897) 12,524. 
Its inhabitants are mostly Raskolniks (i.e. Nonconformists), 
who have numerous monasteries along the river, and members 
of the United Greek Church, with about 2000 Tatars. The chief 
occupations are agriculture and live stock breeding. 

Under the name of Mechetnoye, Nikolayevsk was founded in 
1762 by Raskolniks who had fled to Poland and returned when 
Catherine II. undertook to grant them religious freedom. In 
1828 serious persecutions began, with the result that the 
monasteries were closed with the exception of three, which were 
handed over in 1829 and 1836 to the United Greek Church. 
In 1835 the name of the town was changed to Nikolayevsk. 


NIKOLAYEVSKAYA, SLOBODA, a town of Russia in the 
government of Astrakhan, 3 m. from the left bank of the Volga, 
opposite Kamyshin, and no m. N. of Tsaritsyn. Pop. (1897) 
20,000. It dates from the end of the 18th century, when a 
number of Little Russians settled there for the transport of salt 
from Lake Elton. It is one of the chief centres on the lower 
Volga for the trade in corn and salt. 


NIKOLSBURG(Czech,3f^w/(w),a town of Austria, in Moravia, 
53 m. S. of Brunn by rail. Pop. (1000) 8091. It is situated at 
the foot of the Polau Mountains and near the border of Lower 
Austria. It possesses a chateau of Prince Dietrichstein-Mens- 
dorff, which contains an extensive library, with some valuable 
manuscripts. The Heiliger Berg, in the immediate vicinity, 
has sixteen chapels, and a church in tbe Byzantine style. The 
principal resources are viticulture, the manufacture of cloth, 
and trade in lime and limestone. On the 31st of December 1621 
peace was concluded here between the emperor Ferdinand II. 
and Bethlen Gabor, prince of Transylvania; and on the 26th 
of July 1866 a preliminary treaty of peace between the Prussians 
and the Austrians was signed here. 


NIKON [Nekita Minin] (1605-1681), 6th patriarch of Moscow, 
Russian reformer and statesman, son of a peasant farmer 
named Mina, was born on the 7th of May 1605 in the village of 
Valmanovo, 00 versts from Nishny Novgorod. Misery pursued 
the child from his cradle, and prematurely hardened a character 
not naturally soft; he ran away from home to save his life 
from an inhuman stepmother. But he gave promise betimes of 
the energy and thoroughness which were to distinguish him 
throughout life, and contrived to teach himself reading and 
writing. When he was but twenty his learning and talents 
obtained for him a cure of souls. His eloquence attracted atten- 
tion, and, through the efforts of some Moscow merchants, he 
was transferred to a populous parish in the capital. Shortly 
afterwards, seeing in the loss of his three little children a provi- 
dential warning to seek the higher life, he first persuaded his 
wife to take the veil and then withdrew himself first to a desolate 
hermitage on the isle cf Anzersky on the White Sea, and finally 
to the Kozhuzersky monastery, in the diocese of Novgorod, 
of which he became abbot in 1643. On becoming a monk he 
took the name of Nikon. In his official capacity he had frequently 
to visit Moscow, and in 1646 made the acquaintance of the pious 
and impressionable Tsar Alexius, who fell entirely under his 
influence. Alexius appointed Nikon archimandrite, or prior, 
of the wealthy Novospassky monastery at Moscow, and in 1648 
metropolitan of Great Novgorod. Finally (1st of August 1652) 
he was elected patriarch of Moscow. It was only with the utmost 
difficulty that Nikon could be persuaded to become the arch- 
pastor of the Russian Church, and he only yielded after imposing 
upon the whole assembly a solemn oath of obedience to him in 
everything concerning the dogmas, canons and observances of 
the Orthodox Church. 

Nikon's attitude on this occasion was not affectation, but the 
wise determination of a would-be reformer to secure a free hand. 
Ecclesiastical reform was already in the air. A number of 
ecclesiastical dignitaries, known as the party of the protopopes 
(deans), had accepted the responsibility for the revision of the 
church service-books inaugurated by the late Patriarch Joasaf, 
and a few other very trivial rectifications of certain ancient 
observances. But they were far too timid to attempt anything 
really effectual. Nikon was much bolder and also much more 
liberal. He consulted the most learned of the Greek prelates 
abroad; invited them to a consultation at Moscow; and finally 
the scholars of Constantinople and Kiev opened the eyes of Nikon 
to the fact that the Muscovite service-books were heterodox, 
and that the ikons actually in use had very widely departed from 
the ancient Constantinopolitan models, being for the most part 
imitations of later Polish and Frankish (West European) models. 
He at once (1654) summoned a properly qualified synod of 
experts to re-examine the service-books revised by the Patriarch 
Joasaf, and the majority of the synod decided that " the Greeks 
should be followed rather than our own ancients." A second 
council, held at Moscow in 1656, sanctioned the revision of the 
service-books as suggested by the first council, and anathe- 
matized the dissentient minority, which included the party 
of the protopopes and Paul, bishop of Kolomna. Heavily 
weighted with the fullest ecumenical authority, Nikon's patriarchal 
staff descended with crushing force upon the heterodox. His 
scheme of reform included not only service-books and ceremonies 
but the use of the " new-fangled " ikons, for which he ordered 
a house-to-house search to be made. His soldiers and servants 
were charged first to gouge out the eyes of these " heretical 
counterfeits " and then carry them through the town in derision. 
He also issued a ukaz threatening with the severest penalties 
all who dared to make or use such ikons in future. This ruthless- 
ness goes far to explain the unappeasable hatred with which the 
" Old Ritualists " and the " Old Believers," as they now began 
to be called, ever afterwards regarded Nikon and all his works. 

From 1652 to 1658, Nikon was not so much the minister as 
the colleague of the tsar. Both in public documents and in 
private letters he was permitted to use the sovereign title. 
Such a free use did he make of his vast power, that some Russian 
historians have suspected him of the design of establishing " a 
particular national papacy"; and he himself certainly main- 
tained that the spiritual was superior to the temporal power. 
He enriched the numerous and splendid monasteries which he 
built with valuable lihraries. His emissaries scoured Muscovy 
and the Orient for precious Greek and Slavonic MSS., both sacred 
and profane. But his severity raised up a whole host of enemies 
against him, and by the summer of 1658 they had convinced 
Alexius that the sovereign patriarch was eclipsing the sovereign 
tsar. Alexius suddenly grew cold towards his " own familiar 
friend." Nikon thereupon publicly divested himself of the 
patriarchal vestments and shut himself up in the Voskresensky 
monastery (19th of July 1658). In February 1660 a synod was 
held at Moscow to terminate " the widowhood " of the Muscovite 
Church, which had now been without a pastor for nearly two 
years. The synod decided not only that a new patriarch should 
be appointed, but that Nikon had forfeited both his archi- 
episcopal rank and his priest's orders. Against the second part 
of this decision, however, the great ecclesiastical expert Epifany 
Slavenitsky protested energetically, and ultimately the whole 
inquiry collapsed, the scrupulous tsar shrinking from the enforce- 
ment of the decrees of the synod for fear of committing mortal 
sin. For six years longer the Church of Muscovy remained 
without a patriarch. Every year the question of Nikon's 
deposition became more complicated and confusing. Almost 
every contemporary orthodox scholar was consulted on the sub- 
ject, and no two authorities agreed. At last the matter was 
suhmitted to an ecumenical council, or the nearest approach to it 
attainable in the circumstances, which opened its sessions 
on the 1 8th of November 1666 in the presence of the tsar.. On 
the 1 2th of December the council pronounced Nikon guilty of 
reviling the tsar and the whole Muscovite Church, of deposing 
Paul, bishop of Kolomna, contrary to the canons, and of beating 
and torturing his dependants. His sentence was deprivation of all 
his sacerdotal functions; henceforth he was to be known simply 
as the monk Nikon. The same day he was put into a sledge and 
sent as a prisoner to the Therapontov Byelozersky monastery. 
Yet the very council which had deposed him confirmed all his 
reforms and anathematized all who should refuse to accept them. 
Nikon survived the tsar (with whom something of the old 
intimacy was resumed in 1671) five years, expiring on the 17th 
of August 1681.

NIKOPOL, a town of Russia, in the government of Ekaterino- 
slav, on the right hank of the Dnieper, 70 m. S.S.W. of the town 
of Ekaterinoslav. It was formerly called Nikitin Rog, and 
occupies an elongated peninsula between two arms of the 
Dnieper at a point where its banks are low and marshy, and has 
been for centuries one of the places where the middle Dnieper 
can most conveniently be crossed. Its inhabitants, 21,282 in 
1900, are Little Russians, Jews and Mennonites, who carry on 
agriculture and shipbuilding. The old secha, or fortified camp 
of the Zaporogian Cossacks, brilliantly described in N. V. GogoPs 
novel Taras Bulba (1834), was situated a little higher up the 
river. Numbers of graves in the vicinity recall the battles which 
were fought for the possession of this important strategic point. 
One of them, close to the town, contained, along with other 
Scythian antiquities, the well-known precious vase representing 
the capture of wild horses. Even now Nikopol, which is situated 
on the highway from Ekaterinoslav to Kherson, is the point 
where the " salt-highway " of the Chumaks (Little Russian 
salt-carriers) to the Crimea crosses the Dnieper. Nikopol is, 
further, one of the chief places on the lower Dnieper for the 
export of corn, linseed, hemp and wool. 


NIKOPOLI, or Nicopolis (Turkish, Nighebolu or Nebul), 
the chief town of a sub-prefecture in the district of Plevna 
(Pleven), Bulgaria. Pop. (1908) 5236, including 3339 Turks 
and 1615 Bulgarians. Nikopoli is picturesquely situated on the 
south bank of the Danube, where it receives the Osem. Until the 
creation of a new port at Somovit, in the neighbourhood, Nikopoli 
served as an outlet for the trade of Plevna, Lovtcha and other 
towns in the interior, the principal export being cereals. The 
chief industries are tanning and fishing. As a military post the 
town has for centuries been important. A ruined castle still 
dominates the place, and fortifications stretch down to the river. 

Nikopoli occupies the site of the ancient Asamus, but by some 
medieval confusion bears the name of Nicopolis ad Istrum, which 
was founded by Trajan several miles down the river, at the inflow 
of the Iatrus or Yantra, at the spot still called Nikup. The 
following are the chief points in the modern history of the place: 
— capture of the fortress by Sigismund of Hungary in 1392 and 
J 395; defeat of Sigismund and his hosts in 1396 by Bayezid I.; 
siege of the town by King Ladislaus I. of Hungary in 1444; 
defeat of the Turks by Bathori in 1 595 and by Michael of Walachia 
in 1598; capture of the town by Pasvan-oglu in 1797; occupa- 
tion of the fortress by the Russians under Kamensky in 1810; 
destruction of the Turkish flotilla and storming of the Turkish 
camp by Govarov in 1829; capture and burning of the town 
by the Russians under Kriidener on the 15th of June 1877. 


NIKSHICH (also written Nikshitch and Nikshiti; Croatian, 
NikHt), a town of Montenegro, lying in a flat plain enclosed by 
lofty mountains on the north-west, and watered by the river 
Zeta. Pop. (1900) about 3500. Owing to the prevalence of floods, 
a long viaduct, a gift from Russia, was raised between the town 
and the mountain road which leads to Podgoritsa, 60 m. S.E. 
Nikshich consists of a mass of white houses, dominated by the 
belfry and the pale yellow cupola of its cathedral, another gift 
from Russia. This building is chiefly Byzantine in style, and, 
though hardly beautiful, is the most impressive and by far the 
largest of Montenegrin churches. Close by stands a barrack-like 
royal palace; and a little beyond the town are the ruins of an old 
castle. As Nikshich possesses a brewery and a clothmill, besides 
being the chief mart of Western Montenegro for timber, hides, 
farm-produce and livestock, it ranks second in commercial 
importance to Podgoritsa. About 12 m. S.E. is the celebrated 
shrine of Ostrog (see Montenegro). Nikshich was included in 
the Turkish province of Herzegovina until 1876, in which year it 
was stormed by the Montenegrins, led by Prince Nicholas in 
person. In 1878 the Montenegrin possession was ratified by the 
treaty of Berlin.
