72. Another powerful method, developed by C. F. Klein and 
K. E. R. Fricke, proceeds by discussing the deficiency oifi(j,j')=o 
considered as representing a curve. If this deficiency is zero, j and j' 
may be expressed as rational functions of the same parameter, and 
this replaces the modular equation in the most convenient manner. 
For instance, when n = 7, we may put 

	iB (^+I3r+49)y+$r+I?»^ (T)t/ ,^ (y0t 

	tt' = 49. 

The corresponding singular moduli are found by solving #(r) = 
<£(r'). For deficiency 1 we may find in a similar way two auxiliary 
functions x, y connected by some simple equation yp(x, y) =0 not ex- 
ceeding the fourth degree, and such that j, j' are each rational 
funetions'of x and y. . . 

Hurwitz has extended this field of research almost indefinitely, 
not only by generalising the formulae for class-number sums, such 
as that in § 69, but also by bringing the modular-function theory into 
connexion with that of algebraic correspondence and Abelian in- 
tegrals. A comparatively simple example may help to indicate the 
nature of these researches. From the formulae given at th e beginning 
of § 67, we can deduce, by actual multiplication of the corresponding 
series, 

	t + 00 / — A "f" 00 ff = j=i. ±3. . . . ; 

where 

	= Xx(m)q m l A [m = i»5. 9. 
	x(«) -2(^)1*1 

extended over all the representations m^+417*. In a similar jway 

	Vn0oi=^io5oi 2 = 2(-i)^«-O x (m)gw/4 

If, now, we write 

	tn tn 

we shall have 

	dj\ : dfc : dj »" = 0i O : 0oi : W 
	where 0io, 0oi, 0oo, are connected by the relation (§ 67) 
	0io 4 +0oi 4 -0oo 4 =o 

which represents, in homogeneous co-ordinates, a quartic curve of 
deficiency 3. For this curve, or any equivalent algebraic figure, 
ji(co), j 2 (to) and j*(«) supply an independent set of Abelian integrals 
of the first kind. If we put JC = V«,_y = vV, it is found that 

so that the integrals which the algebraic theory p^ives in connexion 
with jc 4 -f-v*-i =0 are directly identified with ji(«), j*(«) ( ja(«), 
provided that we put x = V «(<•>). 

Other functions occur in this theory analogous to Ji(«), but such 
that in the ^-series which are the expansions of them the coefficients 
and exponents depend on representations of numbers by quaternary 
quadratic forms. 

73. In the Berliner Sitzungsberichte for the period 1 883-1 890, 
L. Kronecker published a very important series of articles on elliptic 
functions, which contain many arithmetical results of extreme 
elegance; some of these Kronecker had announced without proof 
many years before. A few will be quoted here, without any attempt 
at demonstration; but in order to understand them, it will be 
necessary to bear in mind two definitions. The first relates to the 

Legendre-Jacobi symbol (-) . If a, b have a common factor we put 
ly\ =0; while if a is odd and b — 2 h c t where c is odd, we put 

	(?) = I — J (-1 .

The other definition relates to the classification of 
discriminants of quadratic forms. If D is any number that can be 
such a discriminant, we must have D=o or 1 (mod. 4), and in every 
case we can write D = DoQ 2 , where Q 2 is a square factor of D, and 
Do satisfies one of the following conditions, in which P denotes a 
product of different odd primes: — 

	Do = P, with P=i (mod 4) 

	D =4P, Ps-i (mod 4) 

	Do = 8P, P=±l (mod 4). 

Numbers such as Do are called fundamental discriminants; every 
discriminant is uniquely expressible as the product of a fundamental 
discriminant and a positive integral square. 

Now let Di, Di be any two discriminants, then D1D2 is also a dis- 
criminant, and we may put DiD 2 = D = DoQ 2 , where Do is funda- 
mental : this being done, we shall have 

	-» At© ?©].».©'<-«-*-» 

where we are to take M = 1,2, 3,... +«; m,» = o, ±t, ±2,. .. ±00 
except that, if D<o, the case w = w=o is excluded, and that, it 
D>o, (2aw+^)T 7«U where (T, U) is the least positive solution of 
T 2 -DU*=4- The sum 2 applies to a system of representative 

	a,b,c 

primitive forms (a, b, c) for the determinant D, chosen so that a is 
prime to Q, and b, c are each divisible by all the prime factors of Q. 
A is any number prime to 2D and representable by (a, 0, c); and 
finally r = 2, 4, 6, 1 according as DO4, D = -4, D«-3or D>o. 
The function F is quite arbitrary, subject only to the conditions that 
F(xy)=F(x)F(y), and that the sums on both sides are convergent. 
By putting F(x)=x-"-p, where p is a real positive quantity, it 
can be deduced from the foregoing that, if D 2 is not a square, and it 
Di is different from l, 

	rH(D l C«H(IW)-Uj i< g!)2,g)(«^+fcw»+»')-^ ' 

where the function H (d) is defined as follows for any discriminant d :— 

	<2 = -A<o tH(<0=^(-A) 
	d>0 
	h»-SSM±IBS 

h(d) meaning the number of primitive forms for the determinant d , 
This is a generalisation of a theorem due to Dirichlet. 

There is another formula which, in a certain sense, is the generalisa- 
tion of Gauss's sums (§ 62) in cyclotomy. Let ^(m, v) denote the 
function 8 u (u+v) + $oi(u)8 i(v) and let Di, D 2 be any two funda- 
mental discriminants such that D1D2 is also fundamental and 
negative : then

	= v [~/2i\_|-/2^1 2 ql(am2+bmn+ctfl) 
	a,ML\A/ ^VA/ Jm, n 

where, on the left-hand side, we are to sum for Si = 1, 2, 3 . . . f E>»J ; 
and on the right we are to take a complete set of 1 epresentative 
piimitive forms (a, b,c) for the determinant D1D2, and give to m, n 
all positive and negative integral values such that am 2 +bmn+cn 2 is 
odd. The quantity t is 2, if DiD«<— 4, 7=4 if D1D2--4, t = 6 if 
D1D2 — -3. By putting Ds — i, wc obtain, alter some easy trans- 
formations, 

	*2 (z^) zn^ K - ^ A ^ZqK am2+bmn+cni ) 

	s=t \ s / A r9\Q 2 

which holds for any fundamental discriminant -A. For instance, 
taking a = t*K'/K, and A-3, we have Qrf =2kK/tt, and 2gi( m2+mB+B2 )= 
2kKV 3 gn 4K a ver ifi cat j on i s afforded by making 2K approach

whence the limiting value of sn4— is that of 6g5/«V3. which 
= 6/4V3 = V3/2, as it should be. 

Several of Kronecker's formulae connect the solution of the 
Pellian equation with elliptic modular functions: one example may 
be given here. Let D be a positive discriminant of the form 8#+5, 
let (T, U) be the least solution of T 2 -DU 2 = i : then, if h(D) is the 
number of primitive classes for the determinant D, 

(T-UyD)MD)=n(2K/c') 2 
where the product on the right extends to a certain sixth part of 
those values of 2kk' which are singular, and correspond to the field 
Q(V-D),or in other words are connected with the class invariant 
jCV-D). For instance, if D = 5, the equation to find (we') 2 is 
4 .5((kk0 2 -iP+(25 + I3V5) 3 (^') 4 =o 

one root of which is given by ternc') 1 — 9~4V5— T-UV5 which is 
right, because in this case h(D) — 1. 

74. Frequency of Primes, — The distribution of primes in a finite 
interval (a, a +6) is very irregular, if we change a and keep 6 constant. 
Thus if we put n\—fi t the numbers m+ 2 i M+3» * • * (A+w— 1) are 
all composite, so that we can form a run of consecutive composite 
numbers as extensive as we please; on the other hand, there is 
possibly no limit to the number of cases in which p and p+2 are both 
primes. Legendre was^ the first to find an approximate formula for 
F(x), the number of primes not exceeding x. He found by induction 

	F(x) =x+ (loge*- 1-08366) 

which answers fairly well when x lies between 100 and 1,000,000, 
but becomes more and more inaccurate as x increases. Gauss found, 
by theoretical considerations (which, however, he does not explain), 
the approximate formula 

	F(*)=L(x) -/"*,-£- 

	J 2 lOg X 

(where, as in all that follows, log x is taken to the base e). This 
value is ultimately too large, but when x exceeds a million it is nearer 
the truth than the value given by Le^endre's formula. 

By a singularly profound and original analysis, Riemann suc- 
ceeded in finding a formula, of the same type as Gauss's, but more 
exact for very large values of x. In its complete form it is very 
complicated; but, by omitting terms which ultimately vanish (for 
sufficiently large values of x) in comparison with those retained, the 
formula reduces to 

	F(*)=A+2(-i)m1l(*'») 
	(w = i, 2, 3, 5,6, 7, II, . . .) 

where the summation extends to all positive integral values of m 
which have no square factor, and n is the number of different prime 
factors of w, with the convention that when w = i, (—1)^ = 1. The 
symbol A denotes a constant, namely 

	m J2I 
	dx 
	2 x(x 2 -i) log* J 

and L is used in the sense given above. 

P. L. Tch^bichev obtained some remarkable results on the 
frequency of primes by an ingenious application of Stirling's theorem. 
One of these is that there will certainly be (k + i) primes between a 
and b, provided that 

	a <M- 2V 6-l|Rlog6(log6)^ i | R (4fe+25)-|| 
	where R = $ log2+§ log 3 + fc log 5-^ log 30=0-921292

From 
this may be inferred the truth of Bertrand's conjecture that 
there is always at least one prime between a and (2a-2) if 2a>7. 
Tch6bichev's results were generalized and made more precise by 
Sylvester. 

The actual calculation of the number of primes in a given interval 
may be effected by a formula constructed and used by D. F. E 
Meissel. The following table gives the values of F(#) tor various 
values of w, according to Meissel's determinations : — 

	n F{n) 

	20,000 2,262 
	100,000 9»592 
	500,000 41.538 
	1,000,000 78,498 

Riemann's analysis mainly depends upon the properties of the 
function 

	r(s)-2tt-* (rc = i,2, 3, .. . ), 

	n 

considered as a function of the complex variable s. The above 
definition is only valid when the real part of s exceeds 1 ; but it can be 
generalized by writing 

	00 

	2sin,r 2 r( 2 )f( 2 )=tJ^g- fl 

where the integral is taken from x = +00 along the axis of real 
quantities to x = «, where e is a very small positive quantity, then 
round a circle of radius « and centre at the origin, and finally from 
x — e to x — +00 along the axis of real quantities. This i unction 
f(z) is of great importance, and has been recently studied by von 
Mangoldt Landau and others. 

Reference has already been made to the fact that if /, m are co- 
primes the linear form lx+m includes an infinite number of primes. 
Now let (a, 6, c) be any primitive quadratic form with a total generic 
character C ; and let Ix+m be a primitive linear form chosen so that 
all its values have the character C. Then it has been proved by 
Weber and Meyer that (a, 6, c) is capable of representing an infinity 
of primes all of the linear form Ix+tn. 

75. Arithmetical Functions. — This term is applied to symbols such 
as ^»(n), 4>(#), &c., which are associated with n by an intrinsic arith- 
metical definition. The function <E>(w) was written Jn by Euler, 
who investigated its properties, and by proving the formula 

	00 4-00 

	n(i-g*)= 2^4(3 **+*) deduced the result that 

	1 —00 

	J»=/(n-i) +/(n-a) -/(.-sK-.^f-i)'-'/)*- 2 ^) 

where on the right hand we are to take all positive values of s such 
that n-|(35 2 +5) is not negative, and to interpret Jo as n, if this term 
occurs. J. Liouville makes frequent use of this function in his papers, 
but denotes it by f (n). 

If the quantity x is positive and not integral, the symbol E{x) or 
[x] is used to denote the integer (including zero) which is obtained by 
omitting the fractional part of x; thus E(V2) = 1, E(o*7) =0, and so 
on. For some purposes it is convenient to extend the definition by 
putting E(-x)=-E(x), and agreeing that when x is a positive 
integer, E(x)=x-%; it is then possible to find a Fourier sine-series 
representing x- E(x) for all real values of x. The function E(x) has 
many curious and important properties, which have been investi- 
gated by Gauss, Hermite, Hacks, Pringsheim, Stern and others. 
What is perhaps the simplest proof of the law of quadratic reciprocity 
depends upon the fact that if p, q are two odd primes, and we put 
p = 2h+i, q = 2k+i 

the truth of which is obvious, if we rule a rectangle p'Xq" into unit 
squares, and draw its diagonal. This formula is Gauss's, but the 
geometrical proof is due to Eisenstein. Another useful formula is 

	2 E [x +— ) =E(wx)-E(x), which is due to Hermite. 
	f =i \ ml 

Various other arithmetical functions have been devised for par- 
ticular purposes; two that deserve mention (both due to Kronecker) 
are 5wt. which means o or 1 according as h, k are unequal or equal, and 
sgn x, which means x-r|x|. 

76. Transcendental Numbers, — It has been proved by Cantor that 
the aggregate of all algebraic numbers is countable. Hence, im- 
mediately follows the proposition (first proved by Liouville) that 
there are numbers, both real and complex, which cannot be de- 
fined by any combination of a finite number of equations with 
rational integral coefficients. Such numbers are said to be transcen- 
dental. Hermite first completely proved the transcendent character 
of e ; and Lindcmann, by a similar method, proved the transcendence 
of 7r. Thus it is now finally established that the quadrature of the 
circle is impossible, not only by rule and compass, but even with the 
help of any number of algebraic curves of any order when the co- 
efficients in their equations are rational (see Hermite, C.R. lxxvii., 
18^3, and Lindemann, Math. Ann. xx., 1882). Another number 
which is almost certainly transcendent is Euler's constant C. It may 
be convenient to give here the following numerical values: — 

	x =3-I4I59 26535 89793 23846... 
	e =2-71828 18284 59045 23536... 

	= 0-57721 56649 01532 8606065... (Gauss-Nicolai) 
	logio - (*• logioe) =0-13493 4J 840. . . (Weber), 

the last of which is useful in calculating class-invariants. 

77. Miscellaneous Investigations. — The foregoing articles 
(§§ 24-76) give an outline of what may be called the analytical 
theory of numbers, wbich is mainly the work of the 19th century, 
though many of the researches of Lagrange, Legendre and 
Gauss, as well as all those of Euler, fall within the 18th. But 
after all, the germ of this remarkable development is contained 
in what is only a part of the original Diophantine analysis, of 
which, beyond question, Fermat was the greatest master. The 
spirit of this method is still vigorous in Euler; but the appearance 
of Gauss's Disquisitiones arithmetieae in 1801 transformed the 
whole subject, and gave it a new tendency which was strengthened 
by the discoveries of Cauchy, Jacobi, Eisenstein and Dirichlet. 
In recent times Edouard Lucas revived something of the old 
doctrine, and it can hardly be denied that the Diophantine 
method is the one that is really germane to the subject. Even 
the strange results obtained from elliptic and modular functions 
must somehow be capable of purely arithmetical proof without 
the use of infinite series. Besides this, the older arithmeticians 
have announced various theorems which have not been proved 
or disproved, and made a beginning of theories which are still 
in a more or less rudimentary stage. As examples of the latter 
may be mentioned the partition of numbers (see Numbers, 
Partition of, below), and the resolution of large numbers 
into their prime factors. 

The general problem of partitions is to find all the integral 
solutions of a set of linear equations Xc i x i =m i with integral 
coefficients, and fewer equations than there are variables. The 
solutions may be further restricted by other conditions — for 
instance, that all the variables are to be positive. This theory 
was begun by Euler: Sylvester gave lectures on the subject, of 
which some portions have been preserved; and various results 
of great generality have been discovered by P. A. MacMahon. 
The author last named has also considered Diophantine in- 
equalities, a simple problem in which is " to enumerate all the 
solutions of 7x=>i$y in positive integers." 

The resolution of a given large number into its prime factors 
is still a problem of great difficulty, and tentative methods have 
to be applied. But a good deal has been done by Seelhoff, Lucas, 
Landry, A. J. C. Cunningham and Lawrence to shorten the 
calculation, especially when the number is given in, or can be 
reduced to, some particular form. 

It is well known that Fermat was led to the erroneous con- 
jecture (he did not affirm it) that 2 m +i is a prime whenever m is 
a power of 2. The first case of failure is when 7^=32; in fact 
2 32 +i==o (mod 641). Other known cases of failure are w = 2 n , 
with « = 6, 12, 23, 26 respectively; at the same time, Eisenstein 
asserted that he had proved that the formula 2 m +\ included an 
infinite number cf primes. His proof is not extant; and no other 
has yet been supplied. Similar difficulties are encountered when 
we examine Mersenne's numbers, which are those of the form 
2 P — 1, with p a prime; the known cases for which a Mersenne 
number is prime correspond to £ = 2, 3, 5, 7, 13, 17, 19, 31, 61. 

A perfect number is one which, like 6 or 28, is the sum of its 
aliquot parts. Euclid proved that 2 p ~ l (2 P — 1) is perfect when 
(2 p — 1 ) is a prime: and it has been shown that this formula 
includes all perfect numbers which are even. It is not known 
whether any odd perfect numbers exist or not. 

Friendly numbers (numeri amieabiles) are pairs such as 220, 
284, each of which is the sum of the aliquot parts of the other. 
No general rules for constructing them appear to be known, but 
several have been found, in a more or less methodical way. 

78. In conclusion it may be remarked that the science of 
arithmetic (q.v.) has now reached a stage when all its definitions, 
processes and results are demonstrably independent of any 
theory of variable or measurable quantities such as those 
postulated in geometry and mathematical physics; even the 
notion of a limit may be dispensed with, although this idea, as 
well as that of a variable, is often convenient. For the applica- 
tion of arithmetic to geometry and analysis, see Function.

NUMBERS, BOOK OF, the fourth book of the Bible, which 
takes its title from the Latin equivalent of the Septuagint 
'AptdfxoL. While the English version follows the Septuagint 
directly in speaking of Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus and Deutero- 
nomy, it follows the Vulgate in speaking of Numbers. Since 
this book describes the way in which an elaborate census of 
Israel was taken on two separate occasions, the first at Sinai at 
the beginning of the desert wanderings and the second just 
before their close on the plains of Moab, the title is quite appro- 
priate. The name given to it in modern Hebrew Bibles from 
its fourth word Beniidhbar (" In the desert ") is at least equally 
appropriate. The other title in use among the Jews, Vayyid- 
habber (" And he said "), is simply the first word of the book and 
has no reference to its contents. 

Numbers is the first part of the second great division of the 
Hexateuch. In the first three books we are shown how God 
raised up for Himself a chosen people and how the descendants 
of Israel on entering at Sinai into a solemn league and covenant 
with Yahwch (Jehovah) became a separate nation, a peculiar 
people. In the last three books we are told what happened to 
Israel between the time it entered into this solemn covenant 
and its settlement in the Promised Land under the successor 
of Moses. Yet, though thus part of a larger whole, the book of 
Numbers has been so constructed by the Redactor as to form 
a self-contained division of that whole. 

The truth of this statement is seen by comparing the first 
verse of the book with the last. The first is as evidently meant 
to serve as an introduction to the book as the last is to serve 
as its conclusion. This is not to say, however, that the book is all 
of a piece, or written on a systematic plan. On the contrary, no 
book in the Hexateuch gives such an impression of incoherence, 
and in none are the different strata which compose the Hexateuch 
more distinctly discernible. 

It is noteworthy that the problems of Hexateuchal criticism 
are gradually changing their character, as one after another of the 
main contentions of Biblical scholars regarding the date and 
authorship of the Hexateuch passes out of the list of debatable 
questions into that of acknowledged facts. No competent 
scholars now question the existence, hardly any one the relative 
dates, of J, E, and P. In Numbers one can tell almost at a glance 
which parts belong to P, the Priestly Code, and which to JE, the 
narrative resulting from the combination of the Judaic work of 
the Yahwist with the Ephraimitic work of the Elohist. The main 
difficulty in Numbers is to determine to which stratum of P 
certain sections should be assigned. 

The first large section (i.— x. 10) is wholly P, and the last eleven 
chapters are also P with the exception of two or three paragraphs 
in chap, xxxii., while the intervening portion is mainly P with 
the exception of three important episodes and two or three 
others of less importance. The three main episodes are those of 
the twelve spies, the rebellion of Korah, Dathan and Abiram, and 
Balaam's mission to Balak. The last is the only one even of these 
three in which there is nothing belonging to P. Another passage 
which we may here mention is one where the elements of JE can 
be readily separated and assigned to their respective authors, 
viz. chaps, xi. and xii. It is generally agreed that to E belongs 
the passage describing the outpouring of the Spirit on Eldad and 
Medad and the remarkable prayer of Moses in xi. 29, " Would 
God that all the Lord's people were prophets that the Lord 
would put his Spirit upon them," a prayer that closely approaches 
the New Testament idea that all Christians are " priests unto 
God." As usual, the J and E elements possess such a vivid 
character as to render them familiar to ordinary readers. The 
legislative and statistical and especially the ritualistic parts 
belonging to P are so detailed and uninteresting that they make 
no impression on a reader's memory, and P's diffuseness, always 
undue, reaches a climax in chap. vii. where the offerings presented 
by each tribe at the dedication of the Tabernacle are actually 
described in such full detail that six, in themselves extremely 
uninteresting, verses are repeated in identical terms no fewer 
than twelve times. Compare also the very similar repetitions and 
diffuseness in chap. xxix. 

Perhaps, however, the most illuminating example of the 
difference between traditions as recorded in J or E and traditions 
as given by P is found in the very first passage that occurs after 
the first long section of P describing the order of march of the 
several tribes and the position of the ark in the very centre of the 
host, both when encamped and on the march. Notwithstanding 
all this, in x. 30 we find Moses entreating Hobab, the son of Reuel 
his father-in-law, to come along with the Israelites to be " eyes " 
unto them; and in x. 33 it is stated that the ark went before 
them to seek out a resting-place for them. Whether we ascribe 
this whole passage simply to JE or consider, as many scholars 
do, that the first statement is by J and the second by E, it is clear 
that these statements directly contradict P's elaborate scheme, 
according to which the people march, tribe by tribe, with the ark 
in the very centre of the square, and guided by the pillar of 
cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night. There can be 
equally little doubt that these statements are much more 
likely to be in accordance with fact than P's. The latter's 
elaborate plans go on the supposition that great masses of 
men, women and children could be moved about over the 
desert as easily as pawns on a chess-board; but even the 
greatest military leader the world has seen would have been 
unable to preserve such complicated formations amid the 
difficulties inevitable on a desert march ; and the more carefully 
an intelligent reader has studied the details of P's plan, the more 
astonished will he be to read the statement in x. 33 as to the 
position of the ark, and to learn that Moses, instead of simply 
following the pillar of cloud, requests Hobab to determine the 
line of march and select the sites for encampment. No clearer 
proof could be desired of the utterly uncritical spirit of the age in 
which the Hexateuch got its present form than that this detailed 
account should be immediately followed by two short para- 
graphs in palpable contradiction of the whole plan of camp and 
march so elaborately worked out in the preceding narrative. 

The fact is that Numbers is the result of a long literary process 
of amalgamation both of traditions and of documents, a process 
that began in the closing decades of the 9th century B.C. and did 
not finally end till the 2nd century B.C., the earliest date being 
that of J, and the latest probably that of the various addenda to 
Balaam's prophecies, e.g. xxiii. 106, xxiv. 96, xxiv. 18-24. 
Balaam's prayer in xxiii. 10& is not only metrically superfluous, 
but the personal, individual note in it is quite out of keeping with 
every other reference in this poem, which is purely national. 
This addition may therefore have been originally the marginal 
note of a pious scribe which was afterwards transferred to the 
text. In xxiv. 24 Kittim is a name originally derived from 
Kitium, a city of Cyprus. The meaning of " Kittim " was 
then extended to include the inhabitants of all the islands 
and coast-lands of the Mediterranean. Hence it might mean 
not only Macedonia or Greece, but even Italy. In Dan. xi. 
30 it is certainly applied to Rome, the Vulgate rendering it 
" Romam " there just as that version translates it here by " Italia." 
Hence Baentsch would refer this oracle to the time of Antiochus 
JV. (Epiphanes) and even to the embassy of Popillius Laenas in 
168 B.C. when that haughty Roman humiliated the Syrian king 
by drawing a circle round him with his cane, and daring him to 
step out of it till he had given him an answer. 

The book falls naturally into three sections, chronologically 
arranged: (1) Chaps, i.-x. 10, Israel's twenty days' sojourn at Sinai 
during which a census of the people is taken and various laws are 
promulgated by Moses. (2) Chaps, x. ii-xxii., incidents that oc- 
curred during the march of Israel from Sinai to the plains of Moab. 
These incidents seem to have -been chosen for the purpose of casting 
light on the religious history and character of the people and showing 
how later generations explained the origin of various place names, 
cf. Taberah and Kibrothhattaavah, xi. 3, 34, and modes or objects of 
worship, cf. the worship of the brazen serpent, xxi. 4-11, which, as we 
learn from 2 Kings xvhi. 4, continued down to the time of Hezekiah. 
(3) Chaps, xxii. 2-xxxvi., Israel's sojourn in the plains of Moab, their 
experiences while there, and the taking of a second census, prelimin- 
ary to the invasion of Canaan. 

Two examples of the very miscellaneous contents of the book will 
suffice to show the different literary strata of which it is composed. 

(A) We shall take first the account given in chap. xvi. of the 
rebellion of Korah, Dathan and Abiram. There would be originally 
four independent narratives, J, E, and two very distinct strata of P, 
which we may call P l and P* or P*, i.e. later supplements to P. The 
narratives of J and E can no longer be distinguished except from 
slight linguistic data, perceptible only to Hebrew scholars; but the 
three stages of development are quite apparent even in translations. 

1. The first narrative is that of JE, which relates how two 
Reubenites, Dathan and Abiram, rebelled against the civil authority 
of Moses.andwere punished by being buried alive.they and their house- 
holds. Read together verses 16,2a, 12-15 and 25-34, omitting 326, i.e. 
" and all the men that appertained unto Korah and all their goods," a 
clause due to the Redactor, who put it in to unite the narratives, 
forgetting that Korah, not being a Reubenite, could not have had 
his tent with its belongings among the tents of the Reubenites. 

2. The second narrative is P 1 , which tells how Korah, himself a 
Levite, at the head of 250 Israelites rebelled against the religious 
authority of Moses and Aaron because of the privileges conferred on 
the tribe of Levi. Korah and his associates maintained that the other 
tribes, belonging as they did to a holy people, had as much right as the 
Levites to approach Yahweh directly, without the mediation of any 
Levite, and offer sacrifices and even incense to Yahweh Read 
together verses ia, 26-7, 19-24. 

3. The third narrative is P 2 , which relates how Korah at the head 
of 250 Invites protested against the priestly privileges of Aaron, 
claiming that all the Levites had as much right to sacrifice and offer 
incense to Yahweh as Aaron and his sons had. Read together 
verses 8-1 1 and 16 and 17. In both P 1 and F* the disputants are 
summoned from their tents and ordered to assemble before the 
Dwelling of Yahweh ; and in both cases the same fate overtook the 
rebels. Fire descended from heaven and consumed Korah and his 
confederates. It is to be noticed that in both P 1 and P 2 incense is 
burned in pans or censers, so that even the author of P 2 knew 
nothing about an altar of incense. Indeed in xvii. 3 and 4 the altar 
is^ spoken of in such a way as to imply that there was only one altar, 
viz. the altar of burnt-offering, xvi. 2 proves that according to the 
second account the members of Koran's band, so far from being all 
Levites, as they are represented to have been in verses 8-1 1. were 
probably, with the exception of Korah himself, leading members of 
the secular tribes. In xxvii. 3 we find a proof, all the more conclusive 
from being incidental, that Korah 's followers were not all Levites; 
for, had they been so, it could never have occurred to the daughters 
of Zilpahad to repudiate the idea that their father, a Manassite, had 
had a share in Koran's conspiracy. Of course none of the narratives 
is found in its entirety, anything common to two or more of them 
being given only once ; and great skill has been shown in weaving 
them together. 

(B) The story of Balaam as we have it in chaps, xxii.-xxiv. is an 
amalgam of J and E with later additions; but xxxi. 8, 16 proves 
that Balaam was not unknown to P. According to E, Balak sent 
certain Moabite princes all the way to Pethor on the Euphrates to 
ask Balaam to come and curse Israel. But Elohim came to Balaam 
by night and forbade him to go.. t So the^ princes returned disap- 
pointed. A second and still more influential embassy having been 
sent, Elohim again appeared by night^and this time permitted Balaam 
to go on condition that he said nothing but what Elohim bade him 
say. The journey being a long one and across a difficult desert, 
requiring a caravan well equipped with camels, the princes of Moab 
waited till Balaam was ready to accompany them. When Balaam 
reached the frontier of Moab Balak was waiting to welcome him, but 
could not refrain from asking why he had not come with the first 
embassy. With equal frankness Balaam replied that, though tie 
had come now, he had no power to say anything but what Elohim 
might put into his mouth. On being taken to Bamoth-Baal he 
was met by Elohim. Thereupon, instead of cursing the Israelites, 
Balaam blessed them. Though bitterly disappointed Balak still 
attempted to effect his purpose and took Balaam to the top of 
Pisgah, with the result that Israel received a second blessing. 
Balak, now utterly disheartened, abandoned his project altogether. 

According to J, Balaam was among his own people the Bne- 
Ammon when Balak sent messengers to him with presents such as 
soothsayers generally received, asking him to come and curse a 
people that had come up out of Egypt. Balaam protested that, 
though he were to receive a houseful of silver and gold, hecould not 
go beyond the word of Yahweh, his God. Nevertheless his scruples 
were somehow overcome; and, without consulting Yahweh, he 
agreed to go. As the journey was not a long or dangerous one, the 
servants of Balak returned at once to inform their master of their 
success, leaving Balaam to follow at his own convenience. So 
Balaam, still without consulting Yahweh, saddled his ass and set out 
for Moab, attended only by two servants. The land through which 
he had to pass, so far from being a desert, was a land of oil and wine; 
and when Balaam was riding along a narrow path between two vine- 
yards, the angel of Yahweh would have slain him, had not his ass 
swerved and saved him. That this episode belongs to J no one need 
ever forget, since the only parallel in Scripture to the speaking ass 
is the serpent that spoke in Eden. Balaam, after being sternly 
rebuked, was allowed to proceed, but only on condition that " the 
word that I shall speak to thee, that thou shalt speak." Balak met 
Balaam at Ar-Moab, whence they went to Kiriath-Huzoth and thence 
to the top of Peor. There Balaam blessed Israel. Balak angrily 
taunted Balaam with having lost the honours intended for him, and 
bade him flee to his own place. Balaam reminded Balak of his 
declaration that he could not go beyond the word of Yahweh, and 
then boldly announced the respective destinies of Israel and Moab, 
xxiv. 15-19. 

As seven is the perfect number and as Balaam had ordered seven 
altars to be built, the Redactor thought it would be well to have 
seven MSshalim or metrical oracles; and so he added other three 
which are certainly not pertinent to the situation, as they allude not 
merely to the Assyrian empire but to the Macedonian, and even, as 
some maintain, to the Roman empire, cf. xxiv. 24. 

The poetical quotations in Numbers are of the utmost im- 
portance, not only as helping to determine the date of the book 
but as indicating the value of poetry in its bearing on history. In 
xxi. 14 we have a poetical quotation from a lost volume of early 
poetry entitled " The Book of the Wars of Yahweh." It is highly 
probable that Deborah's song was also originally in this book; 
and when we compare the statement in that song as to Israel's 
full fighting strength, viz. 40,000 men, with the statements in the 
prose of Numbers as to 600,000 men and more, we at once 
realise how much closer to actual facts we arc brought by early 
poetry than by the later prose of writers like P. Perhaps it is in 
chap. xxxi. that we have the clearest proof of the non-historical 
character of the book. There we are told that 12,000 Israelites, 
without losing a single man, slew every male Midianite, children 
included, and every Midianite woman that had known a man, 
and took so much booty that there had to be special legislation 
as to how is should be divided. But if this were actual fact, how 
could the Midianites have ever reappeared in history? And yet 
in Gideon's time they were strong enough to oppress Israel. 
From this chapter, unhistorical as it must be, we see how the 
legislation of Israel, whatever its character or origin, was referred 
back to Moses the great Law giver of Israel. (J. A. P.*) 


NUMBERS, PARTITION OF. This mathematical subject, 
created by Euler, though relating essentially to positive integer 
numbers, is scarcely regarded as a part of the Theory of Numbers 
(see Number). We consider in it a number as made up by the 
addition of other numbers: thus the partitions of the successive 
numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, &c, are as follows: — 

	1; 
	2, 11; 
	3» 21, in; 
	4,31, 22,211, mi; 
	5,41,32,311, 221,2111, inn; 
	6, 51, 42, 411, 33, 321, 3111, 222, 221 1, 211 n, iiiiii. 

These are formed each from the preceding ones; thus, to form 
the partitions of 6 we take first 6; secondly, 5 prefixed to each 
of the partitions of 1 (that is, 51); thirdly, 4 prefixed to each of 
the partitions of 2 (that is, 42, 411); fourthly, 3 prefixed to each 
of the partitions of 3 (that is, 33, 321, 31 11); fifthly, 2 prefixed, 
not to each of the partitions of 4, but only to those partitions 
which begin with a number not exceeding 2 (that is, 222, 221 1, 
21111) ; and lastly, 1 prefixed to all the partitions of 5 which begin 
with a number not exceeding 1 (that is, 11 11 11); and so in 
other cases. 

The method gives all the partitions of a number, but we may 
consider different classes of partitions: the partitions into a 
given number of parts, or into not more than a given number 
of parts; or the partitions into given parts, either with repeti- 
tions or without repetitions, &c. It is possible, for any 
particular class of partitions, to obtain methods more or less 
easy for the formation of the partitions either of a given 

	xrx, ,28 

number or of the successive numbers 1, 2, 3, &c. And of course 
in any case, having obtained the partitions, we can count them 
and so obtain the number of partitions. 

Another method is by L. F. A. Arbogast's rule of the last and 
the last but one; in fact, taking the value of a to be unity, and, 
understanding this letter in each term, the rule gives b; c, b 2 ; 
d, be, b 3 ; e, bd 7 c\ b*c, b\ &c, which, if b, c, d, e, &c, denote 
l > 2 , 3, 4, &c., respectively, are the partitions of r, 2, 3, 4, &c, 
respectively. 

An important notion is that of conjugate partitions. 

Thus a partition of 6 is 42; writing this in the form j ll11 ' and 

summing the columns instead of the lines, we obtain the 
conjugate partition 2211; evidently, starting from 2211, the 
conjugate partition is 42. If we form all the partitions of 6 
into not more than three parts, these are 

	6, 51* 42, 33. 4»» 321, 222, 

and the conjugates are 

	iiiiii, 21111, 2211, 222, 3111, 321, 33, 

where no part is greater than 3; and so in general we have 
the theorem, the number of partitions of n into not more than 
k parts is equal to the number of partitions of « with no part 
greater than k. 

We have for the number of partitions an analytical theory depend- 
ing on generating functions; thus for the partitions of a number n 
with the parts I, 2, 3, 4, 5, &c, without repetitions, writing down 
the product 

	1 -f x. 1 +xK 1 -f x*. 1 +x*. . . , = 1 -f *-Hc*-f 2x*. . .+JV*»+ • ■ • , 

it is clear that, if x«, x£, a*, . . . are terms of the series x, x* t x* f . . . 
for which a-f /3-f 7+ . . =n, then we have in the development of 
the product a term x**, and hence that in the term Nx* of the product 
the coefficient N is equal to the number of partitions of n with the 
parts I, 2, 3, — , without repetitions; or say that the product is 
the generating function (G. F.) for the number of such partitions. 
And so in other cases we obtain a generating function. 

Thus for the function 

	r-v t-J t-v3 ,«I+* + 3tf +..+#*•+..., 

observing that any factor l/i — x l is ^l-r-^'-f* ***-{-. . . , we see 
that in the term Nx* the coefficient is ec«ual to the number of parti- 
tions of n, with the parts 1, 2, 3, . . , with repetitions. 

Introducing another letter z, and considering the function 
i+xz. i+x*z. i-hc*s. . . t -x+ £ (x+x*+. .). . . +Nx"£+. ., 
we see that in the term N&z* of the development the coefficient N 
is equal to the number of partitions of n into k parts, with the parts 
1, 2, 3, 4, . . . , without repetitions. 

And similarly, considering the function 

	i- XS .i-k.i- X >z.. ' -*+**+*+-'>-+»*'*+■■ • 

wc see that in the term N&z* of the development the coefficient N is 
equal to the number of partitions of n into k parts, with the parts 
1, 2, 3, 4 with repetitions. 

We have such analytical formulae as 

	1 , zx 

	=i+r=i+r=!^- 

	3+- 

	I— xz.i— x*z.i — X*Z.. * ' I— X ' I— X . i-x* 

which lead to theorems in the partition of numbers. A remarkable 
theorem is 

	1— re. 1— x*.i— x 3 .i — x A . =1— x— x*+x*+x 7 — x li — x li +... t 

where the only terms are those with an exponent i(3** 2 =*=«), and for 
each such pair of terms the coefficient is (-)"i. The formula shows 
that except for numbers of the form i(3« 2=fc ») the number of 
partitions without repetitions into an odd number of parts is equal to 
the number of partitions without repetitions into an even number of 
parts, whereas for the excepted numbers these numbers differ by 
unity. Thus for the number 11, which is not an excepted number, 
the two sets of partitions are 

	11, 821, 731, 641, 632, 542 

	10.1,92, 83, 74» 6 5. 5321, 

in each set 6. 
We have 

	i—x.i+x.i+x*.i+x*.i+&... -1; 

or, as this may be written, 

	1 
	I +*.I+rf.I+*«. !+*•.. 
	1-X 
	., = !+*+**+*»+. 
	'hand 

showing that a number n can always be made up, and in on way 
only, with the parts 1, 2, 4, 8, . . . The product on the lef.-- fc 
side may be taken to k terms only, thus if 6=4, we have 

	i+x.i+x*.i+x*.i+x* t =lf^ f = i+x+x*...+x" t 

	i-x 

that is, any number from i to 15 can be made up, and in one way only, 
with the parts 1, 2, 4, 8; and similarly any number from 1 to 2*-i 
can be made up, and in one way only, with the parts 1, 2, 4, . . 2*" 1 . 
A like formula is 

	i-x» 1-x 9 l-x™ i-rc 81 _ i-s 81 .

showing that any number from —40 to +40 can be made up, and

NUMENIUS, a Greek philosopher, of Apamea in Syria, Neo- 
Pythagorean and forerunner of the Neo-Platonists, flourished 
during the latter half of the 2nd century ad. He seems to have 
taken Pythagoras as his highest authority, while at the same 
time he chiefly follows Plato. He calls the latter an " Atticizing 
Moses. " His chief divergence from Plato is the distinction 
between the " first god " and the " demiurge." This is probably 
due to the influence of the Valentinian Gnostics and the Jewish- 
Alexandrian philosophers (especially Philo and his theory of the 
Logos). According to Proclus {Comment, in Timaeum, 93) 
Numenius held that there was a kind of trinity of gods, the 
members of which he designated as irarfjp, Tcoirjrijs, Toirjfxa 
(" father," " maker," " that which is made," i.e. the world), or 
7r<!t7r7ros, eKyovos, &w6yovos (which Proclus calls "exaggerated 
language "). The first is the supreme deity or pure intelligence 
(poOs), the second the creator of the world (BrjfjLtovpy6s) f the 
third the world (kSgixos). His works were highly esteemed by 
the Neoplatonists, and Amelius is said to have composed nearly 
100 books of commentaries upon them. 

Fragments of his treatises on the points of divergence between the 
Academicians and Plato, on the Good (in which according to Origen, 
Contra Celsum, iv. 51, he makes allusion to Jesus Christ), and on 
the mystical sayings in Plato, are preserved in the Praeparatio 
Evangelica of Eusebius. The fragments are collected in F. G. 
Mullach, Frag. phU. Grace, iii.; see also F. Thedinga, De Numenio 
philosopho Platonico (Bonn, 1875); Ritter and Preller, Hist. Phil. 
Graecae (ed. E. Wellmann, 1898), § 624.7; T. Whittaker, The Neo- 
Platonists (1901). 

NUMERAL (from Lat. numerus, a number), a figure used to 
represent a number. The use of visible signs to represent 
numbers and aid reckoning is not only older than writing, but 
older than the development of numerical language on the denary 
system; we count by tens because our ancestors counted on 
their fingers and named numbers accordingly. So used, the 
fingers are really numerals, that is, visible numerical signs; and 
in antiquity the practice of counting by these natural signs 
prevailed in all classes of society. In the later times of antiquity 
the finger symbols were developed into a system capable of 
expressing all numbers below 10,000. The left hand was held 
up flat with the fingers together. The units from 1 to 9 were 
expressed by various positions of the third, fourth, and fifth 
fingers alone, one or more of these being either closed on the palm 
or simply bent at the middle joint, according to the number 
meant. The thumb and index were thus left free to express the 
tens by a variety of relative positions, e.g. for 30 their points 
were brought together and stretched forward; for 50 the thumb 
was bent like the Greek Y and brought against the ball of the 
index. The same set of signs if executed with the thumb and 
index of the right hand meant hundreds instead of tens, and the 
unit signs if performed on the right hand meant thousands. 1 

The fingers serve to express numbers, but to make a per- 
manent note of numbers some kind of mark or tally is needed. 
A single stroke is the obvious representation of unity; higher 
numbers are indicated by groups of strokes. But when the 
strokes become many they are confusing, and so a new sign 

	1 The system is described by Nicolaus Rhabda of Smyrna (8th 
	century a.d.), a p. N. Caussinus, De eloquentia sacra et humana 
	(Paris, 1636). The Venerable Bede gives essentially the same system, 
	and it long survived in the East; see especially Rodiger, " Uber die 
	im Orient gebrauchliche Fingersprache, &c, D.M.G. (1845), and 
	Palmer in Journ. of Philology, ii. 247 sqq. 

must be introduced, perhaps for 5, at any rate for 10, 100, 1000, 
and so forth. Intermediate numbers are expressed by the 
addition of symbols, as in the Roman system ccxxxvi=236. 
This simplest way of writing numbers is well seen in the Baby- 
lonian inscriptions, where all numbers from 1 to 99 are got by 
repetition of the vertical arrowhead T ~*# and a barbed sign 
K ** 10. But the most interesting case is the Egyptian, because 
from its hieratic form sprang the Phoenician numerals, and from 
them in turn those of Palmyra and the Syrians, as illustrated in 
table 1. Two things are to be noted in this table — first, the way 
in which groups of units come to be joined by a cross line, and then 
run together into a single symbol, and, further, the substitution 
in the hundreds of a principle of multiplication for the mere 
addition of symbols. The same thing appears in Babylonia, 
where a smaller number put to the right of the sign for 100 
(T*-) is to be added to it, but put to the left gives the number of 
hundreds. Thus {T^^iooo, but T^< = no. The Egyptians 
had hieroglyphics for a thousand, a myriad, 100,000 (a frog), a 
million (a man with arms stretched out in admiration), and even 
for ten millions. 

Alphabetic writing did not do away with the use of numerical 
symbols, which were more perspicuous, and compendious than 
words written at length. But the letters of the alphabet them- 
selves came to be used as numerals. One way of doing this was 
to use the initial letter of the name of a number as its sign. This 
was the old Greek notation, said to go back to the time of Solon, 
and usually named after the grammarian Herodian, who described 
it about a.d. 200. I stood for 1, n for 5, A for 10, H for ioo, 
X for 1000, and M for 10,000; II with A in its bosom was 50, 
with H in its bosom it was 500. Another way common to the 
Greeks, Hebrews, and Syrians, and which in Greece gradually 
Syriac. Palmy rene. Phoenician. Hieratic. Hieroglyphic.

displaced the Herodian numbers, was to make the first nine 
letters stand for the units and the rest for the tens and hundreds. 
With the old Semitic alphabet of 22 letters this system broke 
down at 0=400, and the higher hundreds had to be got by 
juxtaposition; but when the Hebrew square character got the 
distinct final forms 1, d, J, *], y these served for the hundreds from 
500 to 900.* The Greeks with their larger alphabet required but 
three supplemental signs, which they got by keeping for this 
purpose two old Phoenician letters which were not used in 
writing (F or g= 1 =6, and 9 — P=9o), and by adding sampim 
for 900. 1 

Among the Greeks the first certain use of this system seems to 
be on coins of Ptolemy II. The first trace of it on Semitic 
ground is on Jewish coins of the Hasmoneans. It is the founda- 
tion of gematria as we find it in Jewish book and in the apoca- 
lyptic number of the beast ("©P pJ = 666). But we do not 
know how old gematria is; the name is borrowed from the 
Greek. 

The most familiar case of the use of letters as numerals is 
the Roman system. Here C is the initial of centum and M of 
mille; but instead of these signs we find older forms, consisting 
of a circle divided vertically for 1000 and horizontally, 9, or in 
the cognate Etruscan system divided into quadrants, ©, for. 
100. From the sign for 1000, still sometimes roughly shown 
in print as do, comes D, the half of the symbol for half the number; 
and the older forms of L, viz. J. or X, suggest that this also was 
once half of the hundred symbol. So V (Etruscan A) is half of X, 
which itself is not a true Roman letter. The system, therefore, 
is hardly alphabetic in origin, though the idea has been thrown 
out that the signs for 10, 50, and 100 were originally the Greek 
X, >£, <£, which were not used in writing Latin. 2 

When high numbers had to be expressed systems such as 
we have described became very cumbrous, and in alphabetic 
systems it became inevitable to introduce a principle of periodicity 
by which, for example, the signs for r, 2, 3, &c, mighi be used 
with a difference to express the same number of thousands. 
Language itself suggested this principle, and so we find in 
Hebrew S or in Greek ,a— 1000. So further jSMu, jSM., or simply 
j3. = 20,000 (2 myriads). If now the larger were always written 
to the left of the smaller elements of a num ber t he diacritic 
mark could be dispensed with in such a case as j&oAa (instead of 
/ jSco\a) = 283i, for here it was plain that j3=20oo, not =2, since 
otherwise it would not have preceded co = 8oo. We have here 
the germ of the very important notion that the value of a symbol 
may be periodic and defined by its position. The same idea had 
appeared much earlier among the Babylonians, who reckoned 
by powers of 60, calling 60 a soss and 60 sixties a sar. On the 
tablets of Senkerah a list of squares and cubes is given on this 
principle, and here the square of 59 is written 58-1 — that is, 
58X60+1; and the cube of 30 is 7-30— that is, 7 sar+30 soss 
= 7X6o 2 +3oX6o. Here again we have value by position; 
but, as there is no zero, it is left to the judgment of the reader to 
know which power of 60 is meant in each case. The sexrgesimal 
system, long specially associated with astronomy, has left a 
trace in our division of the hour and of the circle, but as language 
goes by powers of 10 it is practically very inconvenient for most 
purposes of reckoning. The Greek mathematicians used a sort 
of decimal system; thus Archimedes was able to solve his problem 
of stating a number greater than that of the grains of sand 
which would fill the sphere of the fixed stars by dividing numbers 
into octades, the unit of the second octade being 10 8 and of the 
third io 18 . So too Apollonius of Perga teaches multiplication 
by regarding 7 as the irvdixfy or 70, 700 and so forth. One must 
then find successively the product of the several pythmens of the 
multiplier and the multiplicand, noticing in each case what are 
tens, what hundreds, and so on, and adding the results. The 
want of a sign for zero made it impossible mechanically to 
distinguish the tens, hundreds, &c, as we now do. 

1 The Arabs, who quite changed the order of the alphabet and 
extended it to twenty-eight letters, kept the original values of the old 
letters (putting <^ for d and c* for »), while the hundreds from 500 
to 1000 were expressed by the new letters in order from **» tofr* In 
the time of Caliph Walid (a.d. 705-715) the Arabs had as yet no signs 
of numeration.

Very early, however, a mechanical contrivance, the abacus, had 
been introduced for keeping numbers of different denominations 
apart. This was a table with compartments or columns for 
counters, each column representing a different value to be given 
to a counter placed on it. This might be used either for concrete 
arithmetic — say with columns for pence, shillings and pounds; 
or for abstract reckoning — say with the Babylonian sexagesimal 
system. An old Greek abacus found at Salamis has columns 
which, taken from right to lelt, give a counter the value of 1, 
10, 100, 1000 drachms, and finally of 1 talent (6000 drachms) 
respectively. An abacus on the decimal system might be ruled 
on paper or on a board strewed with fine sand, and was then 
a first step to the decimal system. Two important steps, 
however, were still lacking: the first was to use instead 
of counters distinctive marks (ciphers) for the digits from 
one to nine; the second and more important was to get a 
sign for zero, so that the columns might be dispensed with, and 
the denomination of each cipher seen at once by counting the 
number of digits following it. These two steps taken, we have 
at once the modern so-called Arabic numerals and the possibility 
of modern arithmetic; but the invention of the ciphers and zero 
came but slowly, and their history is a most obscure problem. 

What is quite certain is that our present decimal system, in 
its complete form, with the zero which enables us to do without 
the ruled columns of the abacus, is of Indian origin. From the 
Indians it passed to the Arabians, probably along with the 
astronomical tables brought to Bagdad by an Indian ambassador 
in 773 a.d. At all events the system was explained in Arabic 
in the early part of the 9th century by the famous Abu Ja'far 
Mohammed b. Musa al-Khwarizmi (Hovarezmi), and from that 
time continued to spread, though at first slowly, through the 
Arabian world. 

In Europe the complete system with the zero was derived from 
the Arabs in the 1 2th century, and the arithmetic based on this 
system was known by the name of algoritmus, algorithm, 
algorism. This barbarous word is nothing more than a tran- 
scription of Al-Khwarizml, as was conjectured by Reinaud, and 
has become plain since the publication of a unique Cambridge MS. 
containing a Latin translation — perhaps by Adelhard of Bath — 
of the lost arithmetical treatise of the Arabian mathematician.' 
The arithmetical methods of Khwarizml were simplified by later 
Eastern writers, and these simpler methods were introduced to 
Europe by Leonardo of Pisa in the West and Maximus Planudes 
in the East. The term zero appears to come from the Arabic stfr 
through the form zephyro used by Leonardo. 

Thus far modern inquirers are agreed. The disputed points are — 
(1) the origin and age of the Indian system, and (2) whether or not 
a less developed Indian system, without the zero but with the^ nine 
other ciphers used on an abacus, entered Europe before the rise of 
Islam, and prepared the way for a complete decimal notation.

	1. The use of numerals in India can be followed back to the 
	Nana Ghat inscriptions, supposed to date from the early part of the 
	3rd century B.C. These are signs for units, tens and hundreds, as

in the other old systems we have dealt with. Like the Indian 
alphabet, they are probably derived from abroad, but, as in the case 
of the alphabet, their origin is obscure. The forms of the later 
Indian numerals for the nine digits appear to be clearly derived 
from the earlier system. In table II. the first two lines give forms 
earlier than the introduction of the system of position, while tne 
Devanagari in the third line was used with a zero and position value. 
The " cave " numerals were employed during the first centuries of 
the Christian era. The earliest known example of a date written 
on the modern system is of A.D. 738, while the old system is found in 
use as late as the early part of the 7th century (Bayley). On the 
other hand, there is some evidence that a system of value by position 
was known to Sanskrit writers on arithmetic in the 6th Christian 
century. These writers, however, do not use ciphers, but symbolical 
words and letters, so that it is not quite clear whether they refer to 
a system which had a zero, or to a system worked on an abacus, 
where the zero is represented by a blank column. There is no proof 
as yet for the use of any system of position in India before the 6th 
century, and nothing beyond conjecture can be offered as to its 
origin. 

2. In Europe, before the introduction of the algorithm or full 
Indo-Arabic system with the zero, we find a transition system in 
which calculations were made on the decimal system with an abacus, 
but instead of unit counters there were placed in the columns 
ciphers, with values from one to nine, and of forms that are at bottom 
the Indian forms and agree most nearly with the numerals used by 
the Arabs of Africa and Spain. For among the Arabs themselves 
there were varieties in the forms of the Indian numeral, and in 
particular an eastern and a western type. The latter is called 
ghobar (dust), a name 'which seems to connect it with the use of a 
sand-spread tablet for calculation. The abacus with ciphers instead 
of counters was used at Rheims about 970-980 by Gerbert, who after- 
wards was pope under the title of Sylvester II., and it became well 
known in the nth .century. Where did Gerbert learn the use of the 
abacus with ciphers? There is no direct evidence as to this, for the 
story in William of Malmesbury, that he stole it from an Arab in 
Spain, is generally given up as fabulous. On the other hand, no 
evidence is offered for an earlier use of the abacus with ciphers, except 
a passage describing the system in the Geometria ascribed tt> Boetius. 
If this book is genuine the Indian numerals were known in Europe 
and applied to the abacus in the 5th century, and Gerbert only 
revived the long- forgotten system. On this view we have to explain 
how Boetius got the ciphers. The Geometria ascribes the system to 
the " Pythagorici " — i.e. the Neo- Pythagoreans — and it has been 
thought possible that the Indian forms for the numerals reached 
Alexandria, along with the cruder form of value t>y position involved 
in the use of the abacus without a zero, before direct communication 
between Europe and India ceased, which it did about the 4th century 
a.d. It is then further conjectured by Woepcke that the ghobar 
numerals of the western Arabs were by them borrowed from the 
system of Boetius before the full Indian method with the zero 
reached them; and thus the resemblance between these forms 
and those in MSS. of Boetius, which are essentially the same as 
in other MSS. of the nth century, would be explained. This view, 
however, presents great difficulties, of which the total disappearance 
of all trace of the system between Boetius and Gerbert is only one. 
We have no proof that the Indians ever used such an abacus, or that 
they had value by position at so early a date as is required, and the 
ghobar numerals are too similar to those of the eastern Arabs to 
make it very credible that the two systems had been separated for 
centuries. The genuineness of the Geometria is maintained by 
Moritz Cantor, but it has been attacked on other grounds than that 
of the passage about the abacus; and on the whole it is still an open 
question whether the abacus with ciphers is not the outcome of an 
early imperfect knowledge of the Arabic system, Gerbert or some 
other having got the signs and a general idea of value by position 
without having an explanation of the zero.

NUMERIANUS, MARCUS AURELIUS, son of the Roman 
emperor Cams. On the death of his father, whom he accom- 
panied on his expedition against the Persians, he was proclaimed 
emperor (December, a.d. 283). He resolved to abandon the 
campaign, and died mysteriously on his way back to Europe, 
eight months afterwards- Arrius Aper, praefect of the praetorian 
guards, his father-in-law, who was suspected of having 
murdered him, was slain by Diocletian, whom the soldiers had 
already proclaimed his successor. Numerianus is represented 
as having been a man of considerable literary attainments, and 
of remarkably amiable character. 


NUMIDIA, the name given in ancient times to a tract of 
country in the north of Africa, extending along the Mediterranean 
from the confines of Mauretania to those of the Roman province 
to Africa. When the Romans first came into collision with 
Carthage in the 3rd century B.C., the name was applied to the 
whole country from the river Mulucha (now the Muluya), about 
100 m. W. of Oran, to the frontier of the Carthaginian territory, 
which nearly coincided with the modern regency of Tunis. It 
is in this sense that the name Numidia is used by Polybius and 
all historians down to the close of the Roman republic. The 
Numidians, as thus defined, were divided into two great tribes, 
— the Massyli on the east, and the Massaesyli on the west — 
the limit between the two being the river Ampsaga, which 
enters the sea to the west of the promontory called Tretum, 
now known as the Seven Capes. At the time of the second 
Punic War the eastern tribe was governed by Massinissa, who 
took the side of the Romans in the contest, while Syphax 
his rival, king of the Massaesyli, supported the Carthaginians. 
At the end of the war the victorious Romans confiscated 
the dominions of Syphax, and gave them to Massinissa, 
whose sway extended from the frontier of Mauretania to the 
boundary of the Carthaginian territory, and also south and 
east as far as the Cyrenaica (Appian, Punica, 106), so that the 
Numidian kingdom entirely surrounded Carthage except to- 
wards the sea. Massinissa. who reached a great age, retained the 
whole of these dominions till his death in 148 B.C. and was suc- 
ceeded in them by his son Micipsa, who died in 118. For the war 
with Rome which followed the death of Micipsa see Jtjgurtha. 

After the death of Jugurtha as a captive at Rome in 106, the 
western part of his dominions was added to those of Bocchus, 
king of Mauretania, while the remainder (excluding perhaps the 
territory towards Cyrene) continued to be governed by native 
princes until the civil war between Caesar and Pompey, in 
which Juba I., then king of Numidia, who had espoused the 
cause of the Pompeians, was defeated by Caesar, and put an end 
to his own life (46 B.C.). Numidia, in the more restricted sense 
which it had now acquired, became for a short time a Roman 
province under the title of Africa Nova, but in the settlement of 
affairs after the battle of Actium it was restored to Juba II. (son 
of Juba I.), who had acquired the favour of Augustus. Soon 
afterwards, in 25 B.C., Juba was transferred to the throne of 
Mauretania, including the whole western portion of the ancient 
Numidian monarchy as far as the river Ampsaga, while the 
eastern part was added to the province of Africa, i.e. that 
part which had been called Africa Nova before it was given to 
Juba. It retained the official title, though it may also have been 
known as Numidia; together with Africa Vetus it was governed 
by a proconsul, and was the only senatorial province in which 
a legion was permanently stationed, under the orders of the 
senatorial governor. In a.d. 37 the emperor Gaius put an end 
to this arrangement by sending a legatus of his own to take over 
the command of the legion, thus separating the military from 
the civil administration, and practically separating Numidia or 
Africa Nova from Africa Vetus, though the two were still united 
in name (Tac. Hist. 4. 48). Under Septimus Sevems (a.d. 103- 
211) Numidia was separated from Africa Vetus, and governed by 
an imperial procurator (procurator per Numidiam) ; finally, under 
the new organization of the empire by Diocletian, Numidia 
became one of the seven provinces of the diocese of Africa, being 
known as Numidia Cirtensis, and after Constantine as N. Con- 
st antina, corresponding closely in extent to the modern French 
province of Constantine. During all this period it reached a high 
degree of civilization, and was studded with numerous towns, 
the importance of which is attested by inscriptions (see vol. 
viii. of the Corpus inscriplionum) , and by the massive remains 
of public buildings. The invasion of the Vandals in a.d. 428 
reduced it to a condition of gradual decay; and the invasion of 
the Arabs in the 8th century again brought desolation on the 
land, which was aggravated by continual misgovernment till the 
conquest of Algeria by the French in 1833. 

The chief towns of Numidia under the Romans were: in the north, 
Cirta, the capital, which still retains the name Constantine given it by 
Constantine; Rusicada on the coast, serving as its port, on the site 
now occupied by Philippeville; and east of it Hippo Regius, well 
known as the see of St Augustine, near the modern Bona. To the 
south in the ^ interior were Theveste (Tebessa) and Lambaesis 
(Lambessa) with extensive and striking Roman remains, connected 
by military roads with Cirta and Hippo respectively. Lambaesis 
was the seat of the legion III. Augusta, and the most important 
strategic centre, as commanding the passes of the Mons Aurasius, a 
mountain block which separated Numidia from the Gaetulian tribes 
of the desert, and which was gradually occupied in its whole extent 
by the Romans under the Empire. Including these towns there were 
altogether twenty which are known to have received at one time or 
another the title and status of Roman colonies; and in the 5th 
century the Notitia enumerates no less than 123 sees whose bishops 
assembled at Carthage in 479.

NUMISMATICS (Lat. numisma, nomisma, a coin; from the 
Greek, derived from voyl^aVj to use according to law), the 
science treating of coins (Low Lat. cuneus, a die) and medals 
(Low Lat. medalla, a small coin). 

The earliest known coins were issued by the Greeks in the 7th 
century before the Christian era. By the 4th century the whole 
civilized world used money (q.v.), each state gerierally having its 
proper coinage. This has continued to be the case to the present 
time; so that now there are few nations without a metal 
currency of their own, and of these but a small proportion are 
wholly unacquainted with the use of coins. 

Coins, although they confirm history, rarely correct it, and 
never very greatly. The earliest belong to a time and to nations 
as to which we are not otherwise wholly ignorant, and they do 
not afford us that precise information which would fill in any 
important details of the meagre sketch of contemporary history. 
We gain from them scarcely any direct historical information, 
except that certain cities or princes issued money. When in 
later times the devices and inscriptions of the coins give more 
detailed information, history is far fuller and clearer, so that the 
numismatic evidence is rarely more than corroborative. There 
are, indeed, some remarkable exceptions to this rule, as in the 
case of the Bactrian and Indian coins, which have supplied the 
outlines of a portion of history which was otherwise almost 
wholly lost. The value of the corroborative evidence afforded 
by coins must not, however, be overlooked. It chiefly relates to 
chronology, although it also adds to our knowledge of the 
pedigrees of royal houses. But perhaps the most interesting 
manner in which coins and medals illustrate history is in their 
bearing contemporary, or nearly contemporary, portraits of the 
most famous kings and captains, from the time of the first 
successors of Alexander the Great to the present age, whereas 
pictures do not afford portraits in any number before the latter 
part of the middle ages; and works of sculpture, although 
occupying in this respect the same place as coins in the last- 
mentioned period and under the Roman empire, are neither so 
numerous nor so authentic. There is no more delightful com- 
panion in historical reading than a cabinet of coins and medals. 
The strength and energy of Alexander, the ferocity of Mith- 
radates, the philosophic calmness of Antoninus, the obstinate 
ferocity of Nero, and the brutality of Caracalla are as plain on the 
coins as in the pages of history. The numismatic portraits of 
the time following the founding of Constantinople have less 
individuality; but after the revival of art they recover that 
quality, and maintain it to our own day, although executed in 
very different styles from those of antiquity. From this last 
class we can form a series of portraits more complete and not less 
interesting than that of the ancient period. 

While coins and medals thus illustrate the events of history, 
they have an equally direct bearing on the belief of the nations 
by which they were issued; and in this reference lies 
° °xy* no sma ]i p ar t of their value in connexion with history. 

The mythology of the Greeks, not having been fixed in sacred 
writings, nor regulated by a dominant priesthood, but having 
grown out of the different beliefs of various tribes and isolated 
settlements, and having been allowed to form itself comparatively 
without check, can scarcely be learned from ancient books. Their 
writers give us but a partial or special view of it, and modern 
authors, in their attempts to systematize, have often but 
increased the confusion. The Greek coins, whether of kings or 
cities, until the death of Alexander, do not, with a few negligible 
exceptions, represent the human form. Afterwards, on the regal 
coins, the king's head usually occupies the obverse and a subject, 
usually sacred, is placed on the reverse. The coins of Greek 
cities under the empire have usually an imperial portrait and a 
reverse type usually mythological. The whole class thus affords 
us invaluable evidence for the reconstruction of Greek mytho- 
logy. We have nowhere else so complete a scries of the different 
types under which the divinities were represented. There are 
in modern galleries very few statues of Greek divinities, including 
such as were intended for architectural decoration, which are in 
good style, fairly preserved, and untouched by modern restorers. 
If to these we add reliefs of the same class, and {he best Graeco- 
Roman copies, we can scarcely form a complete series of the 
various representations of these divinities. The coins, however, 
supply us with the series we desire, and we may select types 
which are not merely of good work, but of the finest. The mytho- 
logy of ancient Italy, as distinct from that of the Greek colonies 
of Italy, is not so fully illustrated by the coins of the country, 
because these are for the most part of Greek design. There are, 
however, some remarkable exceptions, especially in the money 
of the Roman commonwealth, the greater number of the types 
of which are of a local character, including many that refer to the 
myths and traditions of the earliest days of the city. The coins of 
the empire are especially important, as bearing representations 
of those personifications of an allegorical character to which 
the influence of philosophy gave great prominence in Roman 
mythology. 

Coins are scarcely less valuable in relation to geography than 
to history. The position of towns on the sea or on rivers, the race 
of their inhabitants, and many similar particulars are 
positively fixed on numismatic evidence. The informa- graphy, 
tion that coins convey as to the details of the history of 
towns and countries has a necessary connexion with geography, 
as has also their illustration of local forms of worship. The 
representations of natural productions on ancient money are of 
special importance, and afford assistance to the lexicographer. 
This is particularly the case with the Greek coins, on which 
these objects are frequently portrayed with great fidelity. We 
must recollect, however, that the nomenclature of the ancients 
was vague, and frequently comprised very different objects 
under one appellation, and that therefore we may find very 
different representations corresponding to the same name. 

The art of sculpture, of which coin-engraving is the offspring, 
receives the greatest illustration from numismatics. Not only is 
the memory of lost statues preserved to us in the designs 
of ancient coins, but those of Greece afford admirable 
examples of that skill by which her sculptors attained their great 
renown. The excellence of the designs of very many Greek 
coins struck during the period of the best art is indeed so great 
that, were it not for their smallness, they would form the finest 
series of art-studies in the world. The Roman coins, though at 
no time to be compared to the purest Greek, yet represent not 
unworthily the Graeco-Roman art of the empire. From the 
accession of Augustus to the death of Commodus they arc often 
fully equal to the best Graeco-Roman statues. This may be 
said, for instance, of the dupondii struck in honour of Livia by 
Tiberius and by the younger Drusus, of the sestertii of Agrippina, 
and of the Flavian emperors, and of the gold coins of Antoninus 
Pius and the two Faustinas, all which present portraits of 
remarkable beauty and excellence. The Italian medals of the 
Renaissance are scarcely less useful as records of the progress and 
characteristics of art, and, placed by the side of the Greek and 
Roman coins, complete the most remarkable comparative series 
of monuments illustrating the history of the great schools of art 
that can be brought together. Ancient coins throw some light 
upon the architecture as well as upon the sculpture of the nations 
by which they were struck. Under the empire, the Roman coins 
issued at the city very frequently bear representations of im- 
portant edifices. The Greek imperial coins struck in the provinces 
present similar types, representing the most famous temples and 
other structures of their cities, of the form of some of which we 
should otherwise have been wholly ignorant. The art of gem- 
engraving among the ancients is perhaps most nearly connected 
with their coinage. The subjects of coins and gems are so similar 
and so similarly treated that the authenticity of gems, that most 
difficult of archaeological questions, receives the greatest aid 
from the study of coins. 

After what has been said it is not necessary to do more than 
mention how greatly the* study of coins tends to illustrate the 
Lit contemporary literature of the nations which issued 
them. Not only the historians, but the philosophers 
and the poets, are constantly illustrated by the money of their 
times. This was perceived at the revival of letters; and during 
the 17th and 18th centuries coins were very frequently engraved 
in the larger editions of the classics. 

The science of numismatics is of comparatively recent origin. 
The ancients do not seem to have formed collections, although 
they appear to have occasionally preserved individual 
°ta> a specimens for their beauty. Petrarch has the credit 
Scteace. °* having been the first collector of any note; but it 

is probable that in his time ancient coins were already 
attracting no little notice. The importance of the study of all 
coins has since been by degrees more and more recognised, 
and at present no branch of the pursuit is left wholly unexplored. 
Besides its bearing upon the history, the religion, the manners, 
and the arts of the nations which have used money, the science 
of numismatics has a special modern use in relation to 
Use* art * Displaying the various styles of art prevalent 

in different ages, coins supply us with abundant 
means for promoting the advancement of art among ourselves. 
If the study of many schools be at all times of advantage, it is 
especially so when there is little originality in the world. Its 
least value is to point out the want of artistic merit and historical 
commemoration in modern coins, and to suggest that modern 
medals should be executed after some study of the rules which 
controlled the great works of former times. 

Definitions. — The following are the most necessary numismatic 
definitions. 

1 . A coin is a piece of metal of a fixed weight, stamped by authority 
of government, and employed as a circulating medium. 1 

2. A medal is a piece, having no place in the currency, struck to 
commemorate some event or person. Medals are frequently com- 
prised with coins in descriptions that apply to both equally; thus, 
in the subsequent definitions, by the term coins, coins and medals 
must generally be understood. 

3. The coinage of a country is usually divided into the classes of 
gold, silver and bronze (copper), for which the abbreviations N, At, 
and M are employed in catalogues. In addition to these metals, 
and to the modifications of them created by the presence of varying 
amounts of alloy, certain other compounds were frequently used, 
notably electrum, billon, brass and potin. 

1 This definition excludes, on the one hand, paper currencies and 
their equivalents among barbarous nations, such as cowries, because 
they are neither of metal nor of fixed weight, although either 
stamped or sanctioned by authority, and, on the other hand, modes 
of keeping metal in weight, like the so-called Celtic " ring-money," 
because it is not stamped, although perhaps sanctioned by authority. 
The latter has attracted much attention, but it is by no means made 
out that the rings were made with the primary intention of serving 
as money. But it is a very common usage among savage or semi- 
savage races to wear all their wealth in the form of ornaments (as a 
woman may even now wear her dowry as ornaments in the form of 
coins) and to use the ornaments (or cut-off portions of them, " skill- 
ings ") whenever occasion arises as a medium of exchange. These 
rings then were doubtless used in this manner, but they were no more 
money than were any other precious possessions which could be used 
in exchange. There is no good evidence for the use of the little 
Gaulish " wheels " as money. On these questions see Blanchet, 
Monn. gaul. pp. 24-29. On the border of the definition are such 
prehistoric " dumps " of metal as have been found at Enkomi in 
Cyprus and at Cnossus in Crete ; one of these indeed seems to bear 
traces of a mark of some kind. 

4. Electrum (rJXcKrpoi', %\eKTpos, \evicd$ xpv<rfc) t a compound metallic 
substance, consisting of gold with a considerable alloy of silver. 
Pliny makes the proportion to have been four parts of gold to one of 
silver.* The material of early coins of Asia Minor struck in the cities 
of the western coast is the ancient electrum. The amount of silver 
varies very considerably with time and place. Gold largely alloyed 
with silver, not struck by the ancient Greeks or their neighbours, 
should be termed pale goW.as in the case of some of the late Byzantine 
coins. 

5. Billon, a term applied to the base metal of some Roman coins, 
and also to that of some medieval and modern coins. It contains 
about one-fifth silver to four-fifths copper. When the base silver 
coins are replaced by copper washed with silver the term billon 
becomes inappropriate. 

6. Brass, a mixture of copper and zinc. It may be used as an 
equivalent to the orichalcum of the Romans, a fine kind of brass of 
which the sestertii and dupondii were struck, but it is commonly 
applied indiscriminately to the whole of their copper currency under 
the empire. 

7. Potin, an alloy of copper and tin (therefore a variety of bronze) 
used for some late Gaulish coins. 

8. Various other metallic substances have been used in coinage, 
including iron (in Peloponnesus) and an alloy of copper and nickel 
employed for some Bactrian coins. The so-called " glass coins " of 
the Arabs are merely coin-weights. 

9. The forms of coins have greatly varied in different countries 
and at different periods. The usual form in both ancient and 
modern times has been circular, and generally of no great thickness. 

10. Coins are usually measured by millimetres, or by inches and 
tenths, the greatest dimension being taken, or, when they are square 
or oval, the greatest dimension in two directions. 

11. The weighfbi a coin is of great importance, both in determining 
its genuineness and in distinguishing its identity. Metric weights 
are used by most numismatists except in England, where troy 
weight is still in general use. 

12. The specific gravity of a coin may be of use in determining 
the metals in its composition. 

13. Whatever representations or characters are borne by a coin 
constitute its type. The subject of each side is also called a type, 
and, when there is not only a device but an inscription, the latter 
may be excluded from the term. This last is the general use. No 
distinct rule has been laid down as to what makes a difference of 
type, but it may be considered to be an essential difference, however 
slight. 

14. A difference too small to constitute a new type makes a 
variety. 

15. A coin is a duplicate of another when it agrees with it in all 
particulars but those of exact size and weight. Strictly speaking, 
ancient coins are rarely, if ever, duplicates, except when struck 
from the same pair of dies. 

16. Struck coins are those on which the designs are produced by 
dies impressed on the blank piece (or flan) of metal by some form of 
hammering or pressure; they are distinguished from cast coins 
made by running metal into a mould. 

17. Of the two sides of a coin, that is called the obverse which bears 
the more important device. In early Greek coins it is the convex 
side, or the side impressed by the lower die; in Greek and Roman 
imperial it is the side bearing the head; in medieval and modern 
that bearing the royal effigy, or the king's name, or the name of the 
city; and in Oriental that on which the inscription begins. The 
other side is called the reverse. 

18. The field of a coin is the space unoccupied by the principal 
devices or inscriptions. Any detached independent device or 
character is said to be in the field, except when it occupies the 
exergue. . .. .« , , 

19. The exergue is that part of the reverse of a coin which is below 
the main device, and distinctly separated from it; it often bears a 
secondary inscription. Thus, the well-known inscription CO NOB 
occupies the exergue of the late Roman and early Byzantine gold 
coins. 

20. The edge of a coin is the surface of its thickness. 

21. By the inscription or inscriptions of a coin all the letters 
it bears are intended; an inscription is either principal or 
secondary. . 

22. In describing coins the terms rigit and left mean the right 
and left of the spectator, not the heraldic and military right and left, 
or those of the coin. ... 

23. A bust is the representation of the head and neck; it is 
commonly used of such as show at least the collar-bone, other busts 
being called heads. A head properly means the representation of a 
head alone, without any part of the neck, but it is also commonly used 

	*Hist. nat. xxxiii. 23; cp. xxxvii. II. Pliny distinguishes two 
	kinds of " electron,"— amber, and this metallic substance. In Greek 
	poetry the name seems to apply to both, but it is generally difficult 
	to decide which is meant in any particular case. Sophocles, however, 
	where he mentions tAtA SApSew* faetcrpov, . . . teal rdv 'Ivducbv X pvc6v 
	{Ant. 1037-1039), can scarcely be doubted to refer to the metallic 
	electrum. 

when any part of the neck above the collar-bone is shown. The 
present article follows custom in the use of the terms bust and 
head. When the neck is clothed, the bust is said to be draped. 

24. A bust or head is either facing, usually three-quarter face, or 
in profile, in which latter case it is described as to right or to left. 
Two busts may be placed in various relative positions, as jugate or 
confronted. 

25. A bust wearing a laurel- wreath is said to be laureate. 

26. A bust bound with a regal fillet (diadem) is called diademed. 

27. A bust wearing a crown with rays is said to be radiate. 

28. An object in the field of a coin which is neither a letter nor 
a monogram is usually called a symbot. This term is, however, only 
applicable when such an object is evidently the badge of a town or 
individual. _ The term adjunct, which is sometimes employed instead 
of symbol, is manifestly incorrect. 

29. A mint-mark is a difference placed by the authorities of the 
mint upon all money struck by them, or upon each new die or 
separate issue. 

30. A coin is said to be "over-struck " or " re-struck " when it 
has been struck on an older coin, of which the types are not altogether 
obliterated. 

31. A double-struck coin is one in which the die or dies have shifted 
so as to cause a double impression. 

32. A coin which presents two obverse types, or two reverse types, 
or of which the types of the obverse and reverse do not correspond, 
is called a mule ; it is the result of mistake or caprice. 

Arrangement of Coins. — No uniform system has as yet been 
applied to the arrangement of all coins. It is usual to separate 
them into the three great classes of ancient coins (comprising 
Greek and Roman), medieval and modern, and Oriental coins. 
The details of these classes have been differently treated, both 
generally and specially. The arrangement of the Greek series 
has been first geographical, under countries and towns, and then 
chronological, for a further division; that of the Roman scries, 
chronological, without reference to geography; that of the 
medieval and modern, the same as the Greek; and that of the 
Oriental, like the Greek, but unsystematically — a treatment 
inadmissible except in the case of a single empire. Then, again, 
some numismatists have separated each denomination or each 
metal, or have separated the denominations of one metal and not 
of another. There has been no general and comprehensive 
system, constructed upon reasonable principles, and applicable to 
every branch of this complicated science. Without laying down 
a system of rules, or criticizing former modes of arrangement, 
we offer the following as a classification which is uniform without 
being servile. 

1 . Greek Coins. — All coins of Greeks, or barbarians who adopted 
Greek money, struck before the Roman rule or under it, but without 
imperial effigies. The countries and their provinces are placed in a 
geographical order from west to east, according to the system of 
Eckhel, with the cities in alphabetical order under the provinces, and 
the kings in chronological order. The civic coins usually precede 
the regal, as being the more important. The coins are further 
arranged chronologically, the civic commencing with the oldest and 
ending with those bearing the effigies of Roman emperors. The 
gold coins of each period take precedence of the silver and the silver 
of the copper. The larger denominations in each metal are placed 
before the smaller. Coins of the same denomination and period are 
arranged in the alphabetical order of the magistrates' names, or the 
letters, &c, that they bear. 

2. Roman Coins. — All coins issued by the Roman commonwealth 
and empire, whether struck at Rome or in the provinces. The 
arrangement is chronological, or, where this is better, under geo- 
graphical divisions. 

3. Medieval and Modern Coins of Europe. — All coins issued by 
Christian European states, their branches and colonies, from the 
fall of the empire of the West to the present day. This class is 
arranged in a geographical and chronological order, as similar as 
possible to that of the Greek class, with the important exception 
of the Byzantine coins and the coins following Byzantine systems, 
which occupy the first place. The reason for this deviation is that 
the Byzantine money may be regarded not only as the^ principal 
source of medieval coinage but as the most complete and important 
medieval series, extending as it does without a break throughout 
the middle ages. The regal coins usually precede the civic ones, as 
being the more important. The medals of each nation should be 
arranged in two series: (1) medals of rulers, according to their dates; 
(2) medals of private persons, as far as possible according to the artists. 

4. Oriental Coins. — All coins bearing inscriptions in Eastern 
languages, excepting those of the Jews, Phoenicians and Cartha- 
ginians, which are classed with the Greek coins from their close 
connexion with them. These coins should be arranged under the 
following divisions: Ancient Persian, Arab, Modern Persian, Indian, 
Chinese and coins of the Far East. 

This method of arrangement will be found to be as uniform as 
it can be made, without being absolutely mechanical. It differs in 
some important particulars from most or all of those which have 
previously obtained; but these very differences are the result of 
the consideration of a complete collection, and haye therefore an 
inductive origin. A general uniformity is no slight' gain, and may 
well reconcile us to some partial defects. 

I. Greek Coins 

There arc some matters relating to Greek coins in general 
which may be properly considered before they are described in 
geographical order. These are their general character, the chief > 
denominations, with the different talents of which they were the 
divisions, their devices and inscriptions, their art, and the mode 
of striking. 

The period during which Greek coins were issued was probably 
not much less than a thousand years, commencing about the 
beginning of the 7th century B.C. and generally ending at the 
death oi Gallienus (a.d. 268). If classed with reference only 
to their form, fabric, and general appearance they are of three 
principal types— the archaic Greek, the ordinary Greek, and the 
Graeco-Roman. The coins of the first class are of silver, electrum 
and sometimes gold. They are thick lumps of an irregular 
round form, bearing on the obverse a device, with in some cases 
an accompanying inscription, and on the reverse a square or 
oblong incuse stamp (quudratum incusum), usually divided in a 
rude manner. The coins of the second class arc of gold, electrum, 
silver and bronze. They are much thinner than those of the 
preceding class, and usually have a convex obverse and a slightly 
concave or fiat reverse. The obverse ordinarily bears a head in 
bold relief. The coins of the third class are, with very few 
exceptions, of bronze. They are fiat and broad, but thin, and 
generally have on the obverse the portrait of a Roman emperor. 
Many Greek cities, however, during the empire issued quasi- 
autonomous coins bearing the head of some deity or personifica- 
tion. Greek coins thus fall mainly into the classes of autono- 
mous, quasi-autonomous and imperial. The coinage of Roman 
colonies in Greek as in other lands is usually distinguished by 
Latin inscriptions. 

Since Greek coinage originated in Asia Minor, the coins were ad- 
justed to the weight-systems there in use, and these go back to a 
Babylonian origin. But it is possible that some of the 
standard of Greece proper had a native origin. The unit Monetary 
of weight in the East was the shekel (sighs). This was s ? sUajs * 
t\ of the manah (mina, mna) t and this ^ of the talent (talanton). 
This scale the Greeks modified, in that, starting from the siglos as 
unit, they invented a money-mina of 50 sigli, with a money-talent of 
6ominaeor30oosigli. Thesiglos-units (and corresponding standards) 
chiefly employed in Asia Minor were the following (the relation 
between gold and silver at the time o( the invention of these units 
seems to have been 13J:]): — 

	Gold shekel, 8*40 grammes. 
	Phoenician silver shekel, 7-44 g.—^ s of 111*72 g. of silver, which 
	was equivalent to 8*4 g. of gold. 
	Babylonian or Persic silver shekel, ii-ij g. ^A of 11 1*72 g. of 
	silver, which was equivalent to 8*4 g. of gold. 

Thus one gold shekel was the equivalent of 15 Phoenician or 10 
Babylonian silver shekels. Side by side with this system was another 
in which the weights were exactly double of those just given; a 
shekel of the heavier system might be^ regarded as a double shekel 
of the lighter. Various Babylonian weights are extant, dating from 
2000 B.C. downwards, which prove the existence of minae of the two 
systems. The gold shekel standard was almost invariably used for 
gold coins, sometimes also for electrum. The Babylonian and 
Phoenician standards were also sometimes used for gold or electrum 
as well as silver. A weight more or less approaching that of the gold 
shekel or its multiples seems to have been usual all over the civilized 
world in Greek times; e.g. the Phocaean standard of 16-52 g. was 
but a modification of it. But for silver in Greece proper, from a very 
early period, the following standards prevailed : the Aeginetic (unit, 
didrachm or stater, of 12*6 g.) and the Euboic-Attic (stater of 8-72 g.), 
with its modification the Corinthian. The Euboic-Attic standard 
attained enormous importance owing to the spread of Athenian trade 
and the adoption of the weight by Alexander of Macedcn. It was 
used for both gold and silver. The Corinthian standard differed only 
in its divisional system, the stater being divided into thirds instead 
of halves. From it were derived some of the standards in use among 
the Greeks of S. Italy. Other standards of more local importance 
were: the Campanian, used in a large part of S. Italy (didrachm 
originally of 7-41 g., afterwards reduced), and perhaps derived from 
the Phoenician; the Rhodian (instituted about 400 B.C., tetra- 
drachm about 15 g.) ; and the cistophoric (from about 200 B.C., with 
a tetradrachm of about 12-73 g.). 

Denominm* The following table exhibits the weights in grammes 
tlons. of the principal denominations of the Greek systems : — 

	Gold Shekel 
	System. 
	Babylonian
	or Persic. 
	Phoenician. 
	Aeginetic. 
	Euboic-Attic. 
	Double shekel, distater or tetradrachm 
	Shekel, stater or didrachm .... 
	Hemistater or drachm 
	Third or tetrobol 
	Twelfth or obol

	4.48 
	I-I2 
	17.44 
	8-72 
	4-36 
	2-92 
	073 

The term stater is usually applied to the didrachm, but also to the 
tetradrachm, and at Cyrene to the drachm. 

The bronze standards have been less fully discussed. Some notice 
of them will be given under different geographical heads. 

In the types of Greek coins (using the term in its restricted sense) 
the first intention of the designers was to indicate the city or state by 
which the money was issued. The necessity for distinctive 
Types. devices was most strongly felt in the earlier days of the 
art, when the obverse of a coin alone bore a design, and, if any 
inscription, only the first letter, or the first few letters, of the name 
of the people by whom it was issued. Whatever may have been the 
original significance of the type in itself, religious or otherwise, it was 
adopted for the coinage — at least in the earliest times — because it 
was the badge by which the issuing authority was recognized. It 
was only with the increased complexity of the denominations in later 
times, when new distinguishing types had to be found, that — as in 
the 4th century b.c. — the religious motive in the choice of types came 
deliberately into play. 

Greek coins, if arranged according to their types, fall into three 
classes: (1) civic coins, and regal without portraits of sovereigns; 

(2) regal coins bearing portraits; and (3) Graeco- 
asses. R oman coins, whether with imperial heads or not. The 
coins of the first class have either a device on the obverse and the 
quodratum incusum on the reverse, or two devices; and these 
last are again either independent of each other, though connected 
by being both local, or — and this is more common — that on the 
reverse is a kind of complement of that on the obverse. It will be 
best first to describe the character of the principal kinds of types 
of the first class, and then to notice their relation. It must be 
noted that a head or bust is usually an obverse type, and a figure 
or group a reverse one, and that, when there is a head on both 
obverse and reverse, that on the former is usually larger than the 
other, and represents the personage locally considered to be the 
more important of the two. We must constantly bear in mind 
that these types are local if we would understand their meaning. 
In the following list the types of Greek coins of 
CMc S & f c * ties * an( * °* ^ n e s ) not having regal portraits, are 
Coins. a ' classed in a systematic order, without reference to 
their relative antiquity. 

1. Head or figure of a divinity worshipped at the town, or by 
the people, which issued the coin, as the head of Athena on 
coins of Athens, and the figure of Heracles on coins of Boeotian 
Thebes. Groups are rare until the period of Graeco-Roman 
coinage. 

2. Natural or artificial objects — (a) animal, often sacred to a 
divinity of the place, as the owl (Athens) and perhaps the 
tortoise (Aegina); (b) tree or plant, as the silphium (Cyrene) 
and the olive-branch (Athens); (c) arms or implements of 
divinities, as the arms of Heracles (Erythrae), the tongs of 
Vulcan (Aesernia). It is difficult to connect many objects com- 
prised in this class with local divinities. Some of them, as the 
tunny at Cyzicus, are doubtless only so connected because the 
chief industry of a place was placed under the tutelage of its 
chief divinity. 

3. Head or figure of a local genius — (a) river-god, as the 
Gelas (Gela); (b) nymph of a lake, as Camarina (Camarina); 
(c) nymph of a fountain, as Arethusa (Syracuse). 

4. Head or figure of a fabulous personage or half-human 
monster, as a Gorgon (Neapolis Macedoniae), the Minotaur 
(Cnossus). 

5. Fabulous animal, as Pegasus (Corinth), a griffin (Panti- 
capaeum), the Chimaera (Sicyon). 

6. Head or figure of a hero or founder, as Ulysses (Ithaca), the 
Lesser Ajax (Locri Opuntii), Taras, founder of Tarentum 
(Tarentum). 

7. Objects connected with heroes — animal connected with 
local hero, as the Calydonian boar or his jaw-bone (Aetolians). 

8. Celebrated real 
or traditional sacred 
localities, as moun- 
tains on which divini- 
ties are seated, the 
labyrinth (Cnossus). 

9. Representations 
connected with the 
public religious festivals and contests, as a chariot victorious 
at the Olympic games (Syracuse). 

The relation of the types of the obverse and reverse of a coin 
is a matter requiring careful consideration, since they frequently 
illustrate one another. As we have before observed, this relation 
is either that of two independent objects, which are connected 
only by their reference to the same place, or the one is a kind of 
complement of the other. Among coins illustrating the former 
class we may instance the beautiful silver didrachms of Camarina, 
having on the obverse the head of the river-god Hipparis and on 
the reverse the nymph o'f the lake carried over its waters by a swan, 
and those of Sicyon, having on the obverse the Chimaera and on 
the reverse a dove. The latter class is capable of being separated 
into several divisions. When the head of a divinity occurs on the 
obverse of a coin, the reverse is occupied hy an object or objects 
sacred to that divinity. Thus the common Athenian tetra- 
drachms have on the one side the head of Athene and on the 
other an owl and an olive-branch; the tetradrachms of the 
Chalcidians in Macedonia have the head of Apollo and the lyre; 
and the copper coins of Erythrae have the head of Heracles and 
his weapons. The same is the case with subjects relating to the 
heroes: thus there are drachms of the Aetolian League which 
have on the obverse the head of Atalanta and on the reverse 
the Calydonian boar, or his jaw-bone and the spear-head with 
which he was killed. In the same manner the coins of Cnossus, 
with the Minotaur on the obverse, have on the reverse a plan of 
the Labyrinth. Besides the two principal devices there are often 
others of less importance, which, although always sacred, and 
sometimes symbols of local divinities, are generally indicative of 
the position of the town, or have some reference to the families 
of magistrates who used them as badges. Thus, for example, 
besides such representations as the olive-branch sacred to 
Athene on the Athenian tetradrachms, as a kind of second 
device dolphins are frequently seen on coins of maritime places; 
and almost every series exhibits many symbols which can only 
be the badges of the magistrates with whose names they occur. 
Regal coins of this class, except Alexander's, usually bear 
types of a local character, owing to the small extent of most 
of the kingdoms, which were rather the territories of a city 
than considerable states at the period when these coins were 
issued. 

The second great class — that of coins of kings bearing portraits 
— is necessarily separate from the first. Religious feeling affords 
the clue to the long exclusion of regal portraits — the 
feeling that it would be profane for a mortal to take p^rafe, 
a place always assigned hitherto to the immortals. 
Were there any doubt of this, it would be removed by 
the character of the earliest Greek regal portrait, that of 
Alexander, which occurs on coins of Lysimachus. This is not 
the representation of a living personage, but of one who was not 
only dead but had received a kind of apotheosis, and who, 
having been already called the son of Zeus Ammon while living, 
had been treated as a divinity after his death. He is therefore 
portrayed as a young Zeus Ammon. Probably, however, 
Alexander would not have been able, even when dead, thus to 
usurp the place of a divinity upon the coins, had not the Greeks 
become accustomed to the Oriental " worship " of the sovereign, 
which he did not discourage. This innovation rapidly produced 
a complete change; every king of the houses which were raised 
on the ruins of the Greek empire could place his portrait on the 
money which he issued, and few neglected to do so, while the 
sovereigns of Egypt and Syria even assumed divine titles. 

The reign of Alexander produced another great change in 
Greek coinage, very different from that we have noticed. He 
suppressed the local types almost throughout his empire, and 
compelled the towns to issue his own money, with some slight 
difference for mutual distinction. His successors followed the 
same policy; and thus the coins of this period have a new 
character. The obverses of regal coins with portraits have the 
head of the sovereign, which in some few instances gives place to 
that of his own or his country's tutelary divinity, while figures of 
the latter sort almost exclusively occupy the reverses. Small 
symbols, letters, and monograms on the reverses distinguish the 
towns in this class. 

The Graeco-Roman coins begin, at different periods, with the 
seizure by Rome of the territories of the Greek states. They are 
^ almost all bronze; and those in that metal are the 
Roman. most characteristic and important. In their types we 
see a further departure from the religious intention of 
those of earlier times in the rare admission of representations, 
not only of eminent persons who had received some kind of 
apotheosis, such as great poets, but also of others who, although 
famous, were not, and in some cases probably could not have 
been, so honoured. We also observe on these coins many types 
of an allegorical character. 

The following principal kinds of types may be specified, in 
addition to those of the two previous classes. (1) Head or 
figure of a famous personage who either had received a kind of 
apotheosis, as Homer (Smyrna), or had not been so honoured, 
as Herodotus (Halicamassus) and Lais (Corinth). (2) Pictorial 
representations, always of a sacred character, although occasion- 
ally bordering on caricature. We may instance, as of the latter 
sort, a very remarkable type representing Athene playing on the 
double pipe and seeing her distorted face reflected in the water, 
while Marsyas gazes at her from a rock — a subject illustrating 
the myth of the invention of that instrument (Apamea Phrygiae). 
(3) Allegorical types, as Hope, &c, on the coins of Alexandria of 
Egypt, and many other towns. These were of Greek origin, and 
owed their popularity to the sculpture executed by Greeks under 
the empire; but the feeling which rendered such subjects 
prominent was not that of true Greek art, and they are essentially 
characteristic of the New Attic school which attained its height 
at Rome under the early emperors. 

There is a class of coins which is always considered as part of 
the Graeco-Roman, although in some respects distinct. This 
is the colonial series, struck in Roman coloniae, and having 
almost always Latin inscriptions. As, however, these coloniae 
were towns in all parts of the empire, from Emerita in Spain 
(Merida) to Bostra in Arabia, in the midst of a Greek population 
and often of Greek origin, their coins help to complete the series 
of civic money, and, as we might expect, do not very markedly 
differ from the proper Greek imperial coins except in having 
Latin inscriptions and showing a preference for Roman types. 

We have now to speak of the meaning of the inscriptions of 
Greek coins. These are either principal or secondary ; but the former 
are always intended when inscriptions are mentioned 
without qualification, since the^ secondary ones are non- 
essential. The inscription of civic money is almost always 
the name of the people by which it was issued, in the genitive 
plural, as A0HNAIfiN on coins of the Athenians, SYPAKOSIflN 
on coins of the Syracusans, or the name of the city in the genitive 
singular, as AKPATANT02 at Agrigentum. The inscription of 
regal money is the name, or name and title, of the sovereign in 
the genitive, as AAEgANAPOY, or BA2IAE02 AAEgANAPOY, 
on coins of Alexander the Great. Instead of this genitive an ad- 
jective is sometimes found, as 'Apko&ik6v on early Arcadian coins, 
'AX^avSpeios on staters of Alexander of Pherae. This genitive or 
adjectival form implies a nominative understood, which has been 
generally supposed to be vdpnana " money/* or the name of some 
denomination. 

There are a few instances in which a nominative of this kind is 
expressed on coins— 4AEN02 EMI 2HMA, " I am the badge 
of Phaeno (?) or Phanes " on an archaic Ionian coin; TOPTYNOS 
TO IIAIMA, "the striking, struck Diece, or type of Gortys"; 
*AI2TI0N TO IIAIMA ZEY6A APTYPION (silver money), or 
KOMMA ("striking" or "struck piece"); and K0TY02 

	Inscriptions. 

	Art of Coins. 

XAPAKTHP ("engraving" or "engraved piece"). Seuthes (end of 
5jth century B.C.) and Cotys (1st century B.C.), semi-barbarian Thra- 
cians^ afford no evidence for Greek usage. The other instances (all 
archaic) point to the nominative understood in early times being in 
reality some word meaning type, or badge. But, if so, this latent 
nominative was eventually superseded by one meaning " money " 
or " coin." Thus the staters of Alexander of Pherae are inscribed 
'AXefcAvSpeios, his drachms 'A\e%ay5pela. Probably from the 4th 
century onwards " coin " was always understood. Occasionally 
the name of the issuing authority is found in the nominative, as 
Kbpe (at Cumae), A&vkX* (Zancle-Messana), *A6e. 6 5«/«>s on a 
late coin probably issued by the Athenians in Delos, TApas at 
Tarentum. These are by no means always descriptive of the type, 
but merely a straightforward way of naming the issuing authority. 
The simple inscriptions of the early period of Greek coinage arc under 
the kings and the Roman empire replaced by elaborate legends, most 
of which, however, fall under the description above given. A 
certain number of inscriptions directly describe the type (not merely 
giving the name of its owner) asZwafTroXts (the goddessof Gela) or 
Nt>ca (at Terina). Others, especially- in Roman times, indicate the 
reason of issue, as f lov5atas eaXwavtas on coins of Judaea under 
Vespasian, or names of festivals for which the coins were issued. 
These, however, properly belong to the class of secondary inscriptions 
which either describe secondary ' types, as A0AA, " rewards," 
accompanying the representation of the arms given to the victor 
in the exergues of Syracusan decadrachms, 1 or are the names of 
magistrates or other officers, or in regal coins those of cities, or are 
those of the engravers of the dies, of whom sometimes two were 
employed, one for the obverse and the other for the reverse, or are 
dates. These inscriptions are often but abbreviations or monograms, 
especially when they indicate cities on the regal coins. 

The importance of Greek coins as illustrating the character of 
contemporary art cannot be easily overrated. They are beyond all 
other monuments the grammar of Greek art. Their geo- 
graphical and historical range is only limited by Greek 
history and the Greek world; as a series they may be 
called complete; in quality they are usually worthy of a place beside 
contemporary sculpture, having indeed a more uniform merit ; t they 
are sometimes the work of great artists, and there is no^ question of 
their authenticity, nor have they suffered from the injurious hand of 
the restorer. Thus they tell us what other monuments leave untold, 
filling up gaps in the sequence of works of art, and revealing local 
schools known from them alone. 

The art of coins belongs to the province of relief : which lies between 
the domains of sculpture and of painting, partaking of the character 
of both, but most influenced by that which was dominant in each age. 
Thus in antiquity relief mainly shows the rule of sculpture; in the 
Renaissance that of painting. 

It may be expected that Greek coins will bear the impress of the 
sister art of sculpture, filling up the gaps in the sequence of examples 
of the art of which we have remains, telling us somewhat of that 
which has but a written tradition. Our first duty is to endeavour to 
place the documents in the best order, separating the geographical 
from the historical indications, first examining the evidence of local 
schools, then those of the succession of styles. It is from coins alone 
that we can discover the existence of great local schools, reflecting 
the character of the different branches of the Hellenic race. In 
tracing the changes in these schools we gain a great addition to our 
ideas of the successive styles, and can detect new examples of those 
which owe their fame to the leading masters. But in dealing with 
works in relief we have the advantage due to their intermediate 
character. In our larger geographical horizon we can trace the 
character of the successive styles, not of sculpture only, but also of 
sculpture and painting. 

Greek coins clearly indicate three great schools, each with its 
subordinate groups. The school of central Greece holds the first 
place, including the northern group centred in Thrace 
and Macedonia, and the southern in the Peloponnesus, schools. 
with the outlying special schools of Crece and Cyrene. 
The Ionian school has its northern group, Ionia, Mysia and 
Aeolis, and its southern, Rhodes and Caria. Beyond these are 
certain barbarous and semi-barbarous groups, of which the 
most important is that of eastern Asia Minor, Persia and 
Phoenicia, with Cyprus. The school of the West comprises the 
two groups of Italy and Sicily. 

The whole duration of the schools is limited, by the repulse of 
the Persians and the accession of Alexander, from 480 to 332 B.C. 
Before this age all is archaic, and it is hard to trace local character- 
istics. After it, the centralizing policy of the sovereigns and the 
fall of the free cities destroyed local art. In certain cultivated 
centres under enlightened kings a local art arose, but it speedily 
became general, and we have thus to think of a succession of styles 

l The arms on the Syracusan decadrachms represent a reward 
given to the victors in the Assinarian games (see below). 

	Central Greece, 

during the rest of the life of Greek art. The century and a half 
of the local schools is significantly the great age of this art. 

In the study of each school we have first to determine its 
character, and then to look in its successive phases for the 
influence of the great masters of style. Two dangers must 
be avoided. We must not too sharply divide the sculptors 
and the painters as if they always were true to the special 
functions of their arts. It is well to bear in mind that the 
earliest great painter, Polygnotus, was a portrayer of character, 
Ka\d$ i}0oypa<j>os, ifiiKbs, as Aristotle calls him, whereas the 
latest great sculptors represented expression (ret iraBtj), Thus 
since fjdos is the special province of sculpture, and tA iraOrj of 
painting, sculpture first weighed down the balance, afterwards 
painting; but it must be remembered that relief can be truer 
to painting than sculpture in the round, which is more limited 
by the conditions of the material and mechanical necessities. 
Our second danger is due to the ease with which local qualities 
may be ascribed to the influence of a leading style. It is also 
to be borne in mind that the movement of art in coins was during 
one period slower than in sculpture — hence an influence more 
general than particular. Pheidias and Myron do not make their 
mark so much as Polyclitus. In all cases the direct influence 
of great masters is to be looked for later than their age. 

The school of central Greece in its southern group, comprehend- 
ing Attica, is remarkable for its widespread extent. It has its 
colonies in Magna Graecia at Thurium, an Athenian 
foundation, probably at Terina, and in Macedonia at 
Amphipolis and Chalcidice under Athenian rule. It 
alone shows instances comparable to the works of Pheidias, though 
its most numerous fine works are of the age of Polyclitus and 
that of Praxiteles and Scopas. Its qualities may be seen by 
comparison of the same subjects as treated by the other schools 
and groups. The earliest works are marked more than any 
others by the qualities of high promise which characterized the 
Aeginetan marbles — the same dignified self-restraint and calm 
simplicity. Next we perceive a series strong in style, and 
showing that lofty dignity, that reposeful embodiment of 
character, which are the stamp of the wor^ks of Pheidias and his 
contemporaries. The subjects are more remarkable for fidelity, 
breadth and boldness than for delicacy of execution or elabora- 
tion of ornament. Every subject is ideal, even the portrayal 
of animal form. Thus the character shows us what divinity is 
intended and the ideality what is intended by the representation 
of beast or bird. From these works we pass to those which 
reflect the style of the time of Praxiteles and Scopas, when the 
influence of painting began to be felt, and art inclined towards 
feeling and descended to sentiment. Still, to the last, character 
rules these coins, and the chief difference we see is in the increased 
love of beauty for its own sake and the fondness for representing 
movement, not to the exclusion of repose, but by its side. In 
other respects there is little change except in the finer execution 
and more ornamental quality of the work. Even when the 
greatest achievement of the Sicilian school, the female head on 
the decadrachms of Syracuse, is copied by the Locrians and the 
Messenians, the larger quality of the school of Greece asserts 
itself, and the copy is better than the original: there is less 
artifice and more breadth. The northern group is at first ruder, 
in the age of Pheidias severer, and afterwards it merges into the 
greater softness of its southern rival. If it copies, as Larissa may 
copy Syracuse and Neapolis in Campania, it again asserts its 
superior simplicity, and we prefer the copy to the original. 

The Ionian school lacks the sequence which the rest of the 
Greek world affords. It is broken by the baneful influence of 
Ionia ^ e P ers * an dominion, and consequently the best works 

belong to the earliest and latest part of the period. 
The earliest coins, of the Aeginetan age, present nothing special; 
the later, of the time of Praxiteles and Scopas, comprise works 
not inferior to those of central Greece, and remarkable, like the 
Western and the Cretan, as the sole records of a school otherwise 
unknown. They are markedly characterized by the qualities 
of the style of feeling, that of Praxiteles and Scopas; but more 
than this, they are the expression of that style in pictorial form. 

They represent expression, and they treat it as it could not be 
treated in sculpture in the round, portraying locks streaming 
in the air and flowing draperies. It must be remembered that, 
while Hellas produced the great sculptors, western Asia Minor 
bred the great painters after Polygnotus, himself a sculptor in 
painting rather than a painter. In the native land of Zeuxis, 
Parrhasius and Apelles we see the evidence of the rule of painting. 
The technical skill is inferior to that of the West, yet the skill in 
modelling is far greater, and has no parallel in the medallic work 
of any other time or country. 

The school of the West, if we except such outlying examples of 
the art of Hellas as those of Thurium and Terina, has its highest 
expression in Italy, its most characteristic in Sicily. 
It has distinctive qualities throughout the age. Even es 

in the earlier period we trace a striving after beauty and a 
delicacy of finish, with a weakness of purpose, that mark 
the school with an influence increasing to a time long after the 
extinction of its rivals. At the same time there is a knowledge 
of the capacity of the materials and the form of the coin and 
a masterly power of finish, on the whole a completeness of 
technical skill which is unequalled. The result in the lower 
subjects is splendid, if wanting in variety, but in the higher we 
miss the noble achievements of the greater schools. So far there 
is a general agreement in the northern and southern groups. 
Yet the Italian shows a nobler and simpler style, with some 
affinity to that of central Greece, which we look for in vain in 
Sicily, though we are dazzled by the rich beauty of the magni- 
ficent series of coins which marks her wealthiest age. Sicilian 
art has this apparent advantage, that the great cities, save 
Syracuse, perished in the Carthaginian invasion, or under the 
tyranny of the elder Dionysius. Thus we have no important 
works save of Syracuse during the second half of our period, and 
cannot judge fully to what this school would have fallen. The 
key to this exceptional development of Greek art is found in 
the absence of sculptors or painters in the West, except only 
Pythagoras of Rhegium at the very beginning of the age, whose 
influence is thought to be traceable on the money of his native 
town. On the other hand, there can be no doubt that many of the 
Sicilian die-engravers, as Phrygillos (to mention one whose 
signature is actually found on an intaglio) were gem-engravers. 
The Western art is that of engravers accustomed to minute and 
decorative work, uninfluenced by sculpture or painting. Their 
designs will not bear enlargement, which only enhances the 
charm of those of the other leading schools. Those of the 
great Syracusan decadrachms are small; those of the minute 
hectae of Cyzicus are large. 

The most important of the lesser schools is the Cretan. Crete, 
retaining the primitive life of older Hellas, was never truly 
civilized, but to the last enjoyed the privileges and 
exhibited the faults of an undeveloped condition. 
Producing in the age of high art neither sculptor nor painter 
of renown, the Cretans, to judge from their coins, were copyists of 
nature or art. At first rude, their work acquires excellence in 
design, but never in execution. While we see their poor reproduc- 
tions of the designs of the Peloponnesus, we are amazed by their 
skill m portraying nature. Their gods are seated in trees with a 
background of foliage. Their bulls are sketched as they wandered 
in the meadows. All fitness for the mode of relief, as well as for 
the material and the shape of the coin, is entirely ignored. 
Hence a delight in foreshortening, and a free choice of subject 
with no reference to the circle in which it must be figuied. In 
spite, however, of their skill, the Cretans never attempted the 
three-quarter face, which is at once the best suited to the surface 
of a coin and the most trying to the skill of the artist. Yet their 
work is delightfully fresh, as if done in the open air. There is no 
idealism, but much life and movement. In a word, the school is 
naturalistic and picturesque. Its works are of the highest value 
in the study of Greek art, but as examples of the application of 
that art to coins they are to be used with caution. Nowhere else 
do we see the artist so freely copying nature and art, nowhere so 
unshackled by academic rules, nowhere so little aware of the 
limitation of his province. 

It is important to study the mode in which Greek money was 
coined, because the forms of the pieces thus receive explanation, 
. f and true coins are discriminated from such modern falsifi- 
\!°i. ° cations as have been struck, and in some degree from those 
Loiaing. w hich have been cast. Our direct information on the 
subject is extremely scanty, but we are enabled by careful inference 
to obtain a very near approximation to the truth on all the most 
important points. 

Of the dies used by the Greeks exceedingly few have been pre- 
served. Inthe museum at Sofia is an iron die for the reverse of a 
coin of Philip II. of Macedon; and several Gaulish dies exist. Most 
ancient dies are of bronze, others of hardened iron or steel. The 
blankswere, as a rule, first cast, sometimes in a spherical form, some- 
times in a form more resembling that assumed by the finished coin. 
The blank was placed between two dies, the lower, let into an anvil, 
producing the obverse, the other, let into the end of a bar, producing 
the reverse. The bar was struck with a hammer, so that the blank 
received at the same time the impressions of both dies. This general 
rule was of course often modified; in some parts of the Greek world 
the dies were hinged together, in others not; and this arrangement of 
hinging the dies came in at different times in different places. The 
machinery of striking was probably much elaborated under the 
Roman empire, but a collar seems never to have been used in ancient 
times. Greek dies must usually have worn out very_ quickly; hence 
an enormous number of slightly varying representations of the same 
type. But the idea that it is uncommon to find two Greek coins 
from the same die is exaggerated. A great number of early Italian 
and Roman, and a few Greek coins, of large size, were cast in moulds, 
not struck ; and under the empire many coins, originally struck, were 
reproduced, not alwavs fraudulently, by casting; but the genuine 
ancient coin of small size is, as an almost invariable rule, struck and 
not cast. 

We may now pass on to notice the Greek coinage of each 
country, following Eckhel's arrangement. The series begins 
Greek w ^k Spain, Gaul and Britain, constituting the only 
Coinage of great class of barbarous Greek coinage. It must not 
the Far be supposed that the money of the whole class is of 
West. one general character; on the contrary, it has very 
many divisions, distinguished by marked peculiarities; it has, 
however, everywhere one common characteristic — its devices are 
corrupt copies of those of Greek or Roman coins. The earliest of 
these barbarous coinages begin with the best imitations of the 
gold and silver money of Philip II. of Macedon. They probably 
first appeared to the north of his kingdom, but the gold soon 
spread as far as Gaul, and even found their way into southern 
Britain, by which time the original types had almost disappeared 
through successive degradations. Next in order of time are the 
silver imitations of Roman coins, the victoriati and denarii of the 
commonwealth, which began in Spain and passed into Gaul, being 
current with the gold money of Greek origin; even in Britain 
the later coinage shows much Roman influence. The copper 
money of Spain follows the imitated silver types ; that of 
Gaul and Britain, though showing Roman influence, is more 
original. 

Side by side with these large coinages we find Greek money 
of colonies in Gaul and Spain, and a far ampler issue of 
Phoenician coins by the Carthaginian kings and cities 
of the Peninsula. The coinage of Hispania, corre- 
sponding to the modern Spain and Portugal, was issued during 
a period of about four centuries, closing in a.d. 41. There are 
four classes of money, which in the order of their relative anti- 
quity, are Greek, of two groups, Carthaginian, Romano-Iberian 
and Latin. The fixst or older group of Greek money (from before 
c. 350 B.C.) belongs to the widespread currency, which reveals 
the maritime power of the Ionians of Phocaea. It consists of 
fractions of the drachm of the Phocaean standard, from the 
diobol or third downwards. Its later pieces are of the Phocaean 
colony of Emporiae, founded by the earlier settlement of Massilia. 
Next in order and in part contemporary, beginning J>efore the 
middle of the 3rd century B.C., come the drachms of Emporiae, 
which betray the influence of Siculo-Punic art. Their standard 
is probably Carthaginian. Of the neighbouring Rhoda, a Rhodian 
colony, there is similar money. Carthaginian coins of Spain 
begin in the same period with the issues of the great colony of 
Gades, following the same weights as the Emporian drachms. 
These are followed by the issues of the Barcides from 234 to 210 
B.C., with Carthaginian types and of Phoenician weight, struck 
of six denominations, from the hexadrachm to the hemidrachm. 

Spain. 

Senor Zobel de Zangr6niz has classed them to Spain, on the 
grounds of provenance and the possession of the silver mines 
by the Barcide kings, against Miiller, who attributes them to 
Africa. The types are Carthaginian, and present some interesting 
subjects. The true Iberian currency begins not long after the 
Punic. The later drachms of Emporiae, ultimately following 
the weight of the contemporary Roman denarius, have Iberian 
legends, and form the centre of a group of imitations issued by 
neighbouring native tribes with their distinctive inscriptions. 
This coinage ceased when the Roman province was formed in 
206 B.C. A little before this date the Romans had begun to 
introduce Latin money; about this time, however, they took 
the backward step of permitting native coinages of Latin weight. 
Probably they found that native legends and types were more 
welcome to their subjects than those of Rome. Consequently 
this coinage of Spain under the republic, which lasted until 
133 B.C., may be almost considered national. The two provinces 
Hispania Citerior and Hispania Ulterior have this marked 
difference: the coins of the nearer province, of silver and bronze, 
have always Iberian inscriptions on the reverse, and are clearly 
under distinct Roman regulation; those of the farther are 
apparently of independent origin, and consequently bear Iberian, 
Phoenician, Libyo-Phoenician and Latin legends, but they are 
of bronze alone. The interest of these coins lies mainly in their 
historical and geographical information. They bear the names 
of tribes, often the same as those of the town of mintage. The art 
is poor, and lacks the quaint originality and decorative quality of 
that of Gaul. Ultimately the native money was wholly latinized 
(133 B.C.), silver was no longer issued, and although the Ulterior 
continued to have its own coinage, in the Citerior only Emporiae 
and Saguntum were allowed to strike coins. Political circum- 
stances for a time renewed the coinage under Sertorius (80-72 
B.C.) in the modified form of a bilingual currency. The purely 
Latin issues of the two provinces, and under the empire more 
largely (from 27 B.C.) of the three, Tarraconensis, Baetica and 
Lusitania, present little of interest. They closed in the reign of 
Caligula (a.d. 37-41), though in later times purely Roman money 
in gold and silver was issued at different times in Hispania down 
to the establishment of the Visigothic kingdom. 

The imperial money of Hispania introduces us to one of the 
two great classes of provincial coins under the empire; the 
larger of these was the Greek imperial, bearing Greek inscriptions, 
the smaller the Roman colonial, with Latin inscriptions, deriving 
its name from the circumstance that among Greek-speaking 
nations the coloniae were distinguished by the use of the Latin 
language on their money. In the coinage of Hispania, issued by 
a nation adopting Latin for official use, the aspect of the coinage 
is colonial, though it was not wholly issued by colonies. Many 
of the Spanish towns belong to the kindred class of municipia; 
others are neither coloniae nor municipia. In Hispania the 
obverse of the coin bears, as usual in the colonial class, the head 
of the emperor or of some imperial personage, the reverse a 
subject proper to the town. The priest guiding a plough drawn 
by an ox and a cow is peculiarly proper to a colonia, as portraying 
the ceremony of describing the walls of the city, so also an ox, 
with the same reference, the altar of the imperial founder, or, as 
connected with his cultus, a temple, probably in some cases that 
of Roma and Augustus. Other types, however, portray the 
old temples in restored Roman shapes, or indicate directly by 
fishes, ears of corn and more rarely bunches of grapes, the pro- 
ducts of the country. Some original and grotesque types have 
a markedly local character. The money of Augusta Emcrita 
(Merida) in Lusitania, a colony of pensioners (emiriti), is specially 
interesting, including as it does the silver issues of P. Carisius, the 
legatus of Augustus. 

The coinage commonly called that of Gaul belongs to the people 
more properly than to the country, for it comprehends pieces 
issued by the Gauls or other barbarians from the 
borders of Macedonia and IUyricum to the English 
Channel and the Bay of Biscay, through Pannonia, part 
of Germany, Helvetia and Gaul. It influenced the money 
of northern Italy, and, crossing the Channel, produced that of 

	The Qaut*. 

Britain, which has its own distinctive features. Four classes 
of coinage are found in these vast limits. Arranging them by 
date, they are the money of the Greek colony of Massilia and her 
dependencies, that of the Gauls and other barbarians of central 
and western Europe, that which can be classed to the tribes and 
chiefs of Gaul and the imperial coinage of that country. The 
coins of the Gauls and other barbarians outside Gallia include the 
gold coins known as " rainbow cups " (Regenbogenschusselchen) , 
which seem to have been an original currency of the tribes in- 
habiting the Bohemian and Bavarian districts, and other gold 
and silver coins (the later series bearing names in Latin char- 
acters) which circulated in Noricum, Pannonia, Helvetia, Upper 
Germany, &c. 

The great mart of Massilia (Marseilles), founded about 600 B.C. 
by the Phocaeans, was the centre of the Greek settlements of Gaul 
Massilia an( ^ n< >rthern Spain. Emporiae was her colony, with 
other nearer towns of inferior fame. Yet Massilia 
always held the first place, as is proved by the abundance of her 
money. At first it consisted of Phocaean obols, part of the 
widespread Western currency already noticed in speaking of 
Emporiae. These were succeeded by Attic drachms, some of 
which, about Philip of Macedon's time, are beautiful in style and 
execution. Their obverse type is the head of Artemis, crowned 
with olive, at once marking the sacred tree, which had grown 
from a branch carried by the colonists, so tradition said, with a 
statue of the goddess, from Ephesus, and proclaiming the value 
of the olive-groves of Massilia. On the reverse we note the 
Asiatic Hon, common to it and the last colony of Phocaea, the 
Italian Velia in Lucania. These coins circulated extensively in 
southern Gaul, and were much imitated by the barbarians on 
both sides of the Alps. 

The Gauls, on their predatory incursions into Greece, must 
have seized large quantities of the gold coinage circulating there, 
QauU kut it is probable that the gold staters of Philip (PI. 

I. fig. 14), from which the chief types of the Gaulish 
gold are derived (PL I. fig. 1), had already found their way, inde- 
pendently of such raids, by means of trade along the Danube 
valley into the districts then inhabited by the Gauls. This is 
clear from the fact that the gold coins of Alexander were never, 
his silver rarely, imitated by the Gauls, yet these were in circula- 
tion at the time of the incursions. Nor did the influence of 
Philip's silver travel far west. But his gold money evidently 
travelled through central Europe to Gallia. The money of Gallia 
before the complete Roman conquest, to which it may be anterior 
in its commencement by half a century, belongs in the gold to 
degraded types of the earlier widespread currency. The un- 
doubted gold and electrum of this imitative class, identified as 
bearing regal or geographical names, are extremely limited. By 
far the most interesting coin of the group is the gold piece which 
bears the name at full length of the brave and unfortunate 
Vercingetorix. The silver money is comparatively common. 
The Gauls were ready to copy any types that came in 
their way, so that in the coinage of Gaul we find imitations 
of the coinage of Tarentum, Campania, various Spanish cities 
such as Rhoda, and Roman coins of the republic and early 
empire. The effect of the silver of Massilia and other Greek 
colonies is especially noticeable in S. Gaul, and the Roman 
denarius naturally exerted a strong influence. The bronze money 
of Gaul is still more abundant than the silver, and has a special 
interest from its characteristic types. Some of the later local 
coins are casts of an alloy of copper and tin called potin, but 
merely a variety of bronze. The Roman coins recall those of 
Hispania, but are limited to a few coloniae. They range in date 
from Antony and Augustus to Claudius. The best-known coins 
of this time, those struck at the colony of Copia Lugdunum 
(Lyons) with the " Altar of Roma and Augustus," belong, how- 
■ ever, strictly speaking, to the Roman series. The coins of 
Nemausus (Nlmes), commemorating the conquest of Egypt in 
the crocodile chained to a palm-tree, were sometimes made in 
the shape of the hind-leg of an animal, evidently for dedication 
in the sacred fountain, from the mud of which all the specimens 
of this variety are derived. 

The ancient coinage of Britain is the child of that of Gaul, 
retaining the marks of its parentage, yet with characters of its 
own due to independent growth. Money first came in Britain. 
trade by the easiest sea-passage, and, once established in 
Kent, gradually spread north and west, until the age of the earlier 
Roman wars, when it was issued in Yorkshire, probably in 
Lincolnshire, and in a territory of which the northern limits are 
marked by the counties of Norfolk, Cambridge, Huntingdon, 
Bedford, Buckingham, Oxford, Gloucester and Somerset. 
The oldest coins are gold imitations of Philip's staters, which, 
whether struck in Gaul or Britain, had a circulation on the British 
side of the Channel. They are the prototypes of all later money. 
From a careful comparison of their weights with those of later 
coins, and from a study of the gradual degradation of the types, 
Evans places the origin of the coinage between 200 and 150 B.C. 
Its close may be placed about the middle of the 1st century a.d. 
The inscribed coins occupy the last century of this period, being 
contemporary with uninscribed ones. The uninscribed coins 
are of gold, silver, bronze and tin, the gold being by far the most 
common. There is small variety in the types, nearly all in gold 
and silver, and some in copper, presenting in more or less degraded 
form the original Gaulish type for gold. It may be suspected 
that all new types and the extremely barbarous descendant of 
the tin series arc of the age of the inscribed coins, or but little 
earlier. The Channel Islands are remarkable for a peculiar 
coinage of billon, a very base silver, presenting the usual types 
modified by Gaulish grotesqueness. The place of this group 
in the British series is merely accidental; in character as in 
geography it is Gaulish. 

The inscribed coins are evidently in most cases of chiefs, 
though it is certain that one town (Verulamium) and some tribes 
had the right of striking money. The most interesting coins are 
those of known chiefs and their families — of Commius, probably 
the active prince mentioned by Caesar, of Dubnovellaunus, 
mentioned in the famous Ancyra inscription, which has been 
called the will of Augustus, and most of all the large and interest- 
ing series of Cunobelinus, Shakespeare's Cymbeline (PI. I. fig. 2), 
his brother Epaticcus, and his father Tasciovanus. It is evident 
from the coins and historical evidence collected by Evans that 
Tasciovanus had a long reign. His chief town, as we learn from 
his money, was Verulamium. His coins are in three metals, 
repeat the traditional types, and present new ones, some showing 
a distinctly Roman influence. The money of Epaticcus is scanty, 
but that of Cunobelinus, with Camulodunum (Colchester) for his 
chief town, is even more abundant than his father's, indicating 
a second long reign, and having the same general characteristics. 
The gold shows a modification of the traditional type, the silver 
and bronze the free action of Roman influence and a remarkable 
progress in art. With the death of this prince not long before 
a.d. 43 the bulk of the British coinage probably ceases, none being 
known of his sons, Adminius, Togodumnus and the more famous 
Caractacus, but the coins of the Iceni may have continued as 
late as a.d. 50, and the Brigantes issued silver coins as late as 
the time of Cartimandua, whose name is partly preserved on one 
of them. 

The ancient coins of Italy occupy the next place. They appear 
to have been struck during a period of more than 500 years, the 
oldest being probably of the beginning of the 6th JtaSy ^ 

century B.C. and the latest somewhat anterior to the 
time of Julius Caesar. The larger number, however, are of the 
age before the great extension of Roman power, which soon led 
to the use of Roman money almost throughout Italy. There are 
two great classes, which may be called the proper Italian and the 
Graeco-Italian; but many coins present peculiarities of both. 
The proper Italian coins are. of gold, silver and bronze. Of these, 
the gold coins are extremely rare, and can never have been 
struck in any large numbers. The silver are comparatively 
common, but the bronze are very numerous and characteristic. 
A few of the earliest gold and silver coins of Etruria have a 
perfectly plain reverse. The most remarkable bronze coins of this 
class are of the kind called aes grave, most of which were the early 
proper coinage of Rome, although others are known to have been

issued by other Italian cities. These are very thick coins, some 
of which are of great size, while most have a rude appearance. 
They are always cast, and were preceded by formless lumps of 
bronze, known as aes rude, which were not properly a state- 
coinage. The designs of the Italian coins are generally, if not 
always, of Greek origin, although the influence of the native 
mythology may be sometimes traced. The inscriptions are in 
Latin, Oscan or Etruscan, and follow a native orthography; 
sometimes on the earlier coins they are retrograde. The art of 
this class is generally poor, or even barbarous. The denomina- 
tions are common to Greek money, except in the case of the bronze, 
which follows a native system. Of this system the early proper 
Roman coins afford the best known examples. The Graeco- 
Italian coins are of gold, silver and bronze. The silver and 
bronze are very common, and the gold comparatively so, although 
struck by few states or cities. A number of the cities of S. Italy 
issued in the 6th century coins with an incuse design on the 
reverse repeating with slight modifications the design of the 
obverse. The designs are of Greek origin, although here, as in 
the proper Italian coins, but less markedly, native influence can 
be detected. This influence is evident in the frequent occurrence 
of types symbolically representing rivers, showing a bias towards 
the old nature- worship, and still more in the use of Latin in- 
scriptions, with half-Italian forms of the letters on coins other- 
wise Greek. Of the best art of ancient Italian money we have 
already spoken, and we shall have occasion to mention some of its 
most beautiful examples. The denominations of the gold and 
silver coins are unquestionably derived from those of Greece, 
according to the weight of the Attic talent, the heaviest 
gold piece being the stater or 3000th part of that talent; in 
silver there are few tetradrachms, the didrachms are extremely 
common, and smaller denominations are usually not rare. We 
thus learn that the silver currency was chiefly of didrachms, 
smaller pieces being less used, and larger ones scarcely used at 
all. It is important here to notice that the interchange of the 
native or Italian bronze coinage with the Greek silver coinage 
led to a double standard, silver and bronze. The bronze standard, 
as migfct be suspected, was of Italian origin, the silver of foreign 
introduction. 

The peculiarity of the Italian bronze is that in its oldest cast 
form it was of such weight as to show the absence in some parts 
of the country of silver equivalents. It was long after silver had 
been introduced everywhere, with struck bronze equivalents, 
before the heavy coinage (aes grave) went out of circulation. 
The silver money is at first remarkable for the evidence it affords 
of its extraneous character in presenting two standards. After- 
wards it becomes equivalent to the bronze, or supplies equivalent 
pieces, and is quite regular. The original condition of the Italian 
currencies is best illustrated by the money of Etruria in the 
4th and 3rd centuries B.C. Etruria, be it remembered, was an 
early goal of oriental commerce by sea. At the great mart of 
Populonia, and in the country round, we find, besides a few gold 
coins, not only silver coins of two different foreign standards, 
the Euboic and the so-called Persic, but also cast aes grave and 
later struck bronze pieces. Without discussing the origin of these 
various currencies it is enough to note that they bear witness to 
the effects of a widely-spread commerce, and show that here was 
the meeting-point of the native system and of foreign ones. 

In Italy the aes grave long ruled. Originally it was libral, the 
principal coin being the as, nominally of the weight of the Italic 
pound of 273 grammes; this, at least, is the weight of the earliest 
Roman coinage. Oh the other hand, the aes grave of some places 
in E. Italy, as Hatria and Ariminum, is heavier. The successive 
reductions of the as belong to Roman numismatics, and it is only 
necessary here to add that they affected the local bronze coinages 
as Italy fell under the rule of the republic. The silver coinages, 
on the other hand, survived for a longer time throughout the 
Greek cities. Apart from the complicated silver coinage of 
Etruria, and from the Roman issues, we find in central Italy 
a few silver coins (the unit of 1-18 grammes being the equivalent, 
at the rate of 1-250, of a bronze as of 11-10 oz.) and a large silver 
coinage of didrachms and smaller denominations in lower Italy. 

This was chiefly issued by the wealthy marts which dotted the 
coasts of Campania, Calabria, Lucania and the Bruttii. We 
find Etruscan inscriptions on the coins of Etruria, and Oscan on 
some of those of middle and lower Italy, where they are eclipsed 
in number and style by the Greek issues. The chief silver 
standards of S. Italy are (1) the Campanian (with a didrachm 
of 7-41 grammes); (2) the Italic, with a stater of 8*i6 grammes, 
divided into thirds; and (3) the Tarentine, with a stater of 8*32 
grammes, divided into halves. The Tarentine stater was known 
as roD£i£ios. The independent coinage of Italy, with one exception, 
came to an end in 89 B.C. 

Beginning in the north of Italy, the first coins that strike us 
are those of Populonia in Etruria. The silver money of this 
place is generally of the peculiar fabric in which the reverse is left 
perfectly plain. The aes grave of upper and middle Italy was 
largely dominated by the issues of the Roman mints at Rome 
and Capua (to be treated later). Samnium shows us a curious 
revival of native silver money after the local coinage of the Italian 
towns had been almost abolished by Rome. It was the result of 
the Social or Marsic War of the confederate tribes, who struck 
for Italy against the Roman supremacy during the years between 
90 and 88 B.C. The coins present the head of Italia, and reverse 
types, of which the most striking are warriors, varying in number, 
taking an oath over a sacrificial pig, and a bull for Italy goring 
the prostrate wolf of Rome. The inscriptions are Oscan or 
Latin. 

Certain of the Greek towns of Italy deserve special mention for 
the splendour of their coinage — beautiful in style and delicate in 
execution. In Campania (leaving the Romano-Cam panian Q-.-t 
for later notice) the two most interesting currencies are of t ownsQ f 
Cumae and Neapolis, the modern Naples. Cumae presents „. 
silver money of the archaic and the early fine style, wy * 
in which last we first observe the peculiar naivet6 of western 
Greek art before it had attained elaboration. The abundant silver 
coins of Neapolis are of the early and the late fine periods and of the 
decline. The types are usually the head of the siren Parthenope, 
more rarely Athene; the reverse presents the man-headed bull 
common on Campanian money, and possibly meant for the river-god 
Acheloiis, father of the Sirens. The bronze money is of good style, 
and age has beautified it with the rich blue or green patina due to the 
sulphurous soil. When we reach Calabria the Greek money startles 
us in astonishing wealth of beauty in the currency of the opulent and 
luxurious mart of Tarentum, second only to Syracuse in the whole 
West, of all the main periods of art, and including in theage of its 
present prosperity and its fall (the time of the contest with Rome) 
the most abundant gold issues of any Greek city. The gold money of 
Tarentum (see Plate) is a delight to the eye, with the varied beauty 
of its gem-like types, which, while they show the gem-engraver's art, 
prove the medallist's knowledge of the rich but opaque metallic 
material. Several heads of divinities adorn these coins, and the chief 
reverse types relate to the legendary founder, Taras, son of Poseidon. 
Always a youth, he appears as a charioteer, perhaps as a horseman, 
and riding on a dolphin — the familiar Tarentine type. The most 
remarkable subject represents him with outstretched arms praying 
to Poseidon, probably in allusion to the Tarentines' appeal to Sparta 
for aid about 346 B.C. (PI. 1. fig. 3)* The silver coinage is chiefly of 
didrachms of reduced Corinthian weight. The prevalent type is 
Taras seated on a dolphin; in the earliest money the type is single, 
and repeated incuse on the reverse; afterwards this subject occupies 
the reverse, and, itself a charming composition, is delightfully varied. 
On the early fine coins the people or demos, personified generally as 
a youth, often holding a spindle, occupies the obverse, but gives place 
in the 4th century to a horseman in various attitudes, affording great 
scope to the engraver's skill ; probably he is Taras himself, save when 
he is a full-grown warrior. These representations illustrate the 
famed horsemanship of the Tarentines, and refer to contests and 
games which were probably local. Hcraclea in Lucania shows us 
didrachms of the fine age, with heads of Athene and subjects con- 
nected with Heracles: the contest with the Nemean lion is most 
skilfully treated, and the series is very characteristic of the gem- 
engraver's art. The powerful city of Metapontum begins with early 
coins having the incuse reverse, and then displays a long series 
stretching down to the decline of art. The constant type, which 
recurs with the heraldic instinct of the West, is the ear of barley, 
reminding us of the " golden harvest " (xpwtovv Qlpoi) which the 
Metapontines dedicated at Delphi. Like the Tarentine badge, it 
first occupies the obverse, then the reverse, balanced by a charming 
series of heads of divinities. Persephone is the most appropriate 
counterpart; we also noteheadsof Concordia ('OM^wia) and Hygieia, 
marked by an ingenuous grace peculiar to the early fine work of the 
Western school, of Leucippus the founder as a hel meted warrior 
(occurring on a rare tetradrachm and the usual^ didrachms), and 
many other types of unusual variety and originality of conception. 
Poseidonia issued coins from the archaic period (beginning with 
the usual incuse fabric) to its capture by the Lucanians early 
in the 4th century. Its successor Paestum began to coin about 
300, and was allowed to keep its mint open even after 89 B.C., 
when all other local mints in Italy were closed, until the time of 
Tiberius. . 

The ancient Sybans, famous for her luxury, has left archaic coins; 
she was, however, destroyed by Croton in 510 B.C. The Athenian 
colony of Thurium eventually arose near the site of theold Sybaris 
in 443, and immediately began to issue a splendid series of coins. 
Not only is the face of the coin occupied by the head of Athene, and 
the great currency, as at Athens, of tetradrachms, but the severe 
beauty of the style points to the direct influence of the art of central 
Greece (PI. I. fig. 4). The head of Athene is covered by a helmet 
adorned first with a wreath of olive and then a splendid figure of the 
sea-monster Scylla. The reverse shows a bull butting (tfofcpios), in 
a strikingly ideal form. Probably the obverse type affords the nearest 
reflection of the masterpiece of Pheidias, or at least the closest 
following of his style. 

Velia, the last colony of Phocaea, whose citizens sailed away to 
the far west rather than submit to the Persian tyrant (544 B.C.), 
shows coins from its foundation. The pieces of fine work witness to 
an Asiatic origin in the types of the lion, devouring the stag or as 
a single device, while the obverse displays the head of Athene so 
much in favour in Magna Graecia. The style, which lacks strength 
but not beauty, is Italian, and we see no trace of the pictorial qualities 
of Ionian art, which indeed had not taken its mature form when 
the exiles left the mother country. 

The Bruttii are the first native Italians whom we find striking 
a fair Greek coinage. Their gold and silver is of late style, the gold 
presenting the head of Poseidon and Thetis 011 a sea-horse, the 
silver the head of Thetis and the figure ofPoseidon, both with other 
subjects. Caulonia has early coins running down to the early fine 
period, mythologically interesting in type, and the later with a 
beautifully designed stag on the reverse. For Croton the ruling type 
is the tripod. The eagle occurs on the obverse and the tripod on the 
reverse. The bird of Zeus is inferior to that at Agrigentum, as this 
again is inferior to the eagle of Elis. We note also beautiful types of 
Heracles seated, one of marvellously delicate work, on the reverse of 
which Apollo aims an arrow at the Python from behind his tripod — 
a remarkable composition. The other Heracles types form a most 
interesting series of recollections, " memory sketches," of a famous 
statue, the pose of which recalls the so-called Theseus of the 
Parthenon, while the obverse presents the head of the Hera Lacinia 
worshipped on the promontory close by. The latest coins, like the 
parallel ones of Metapontum, are weak and pretty. The money of the 
Locri Epizephyrii affords two curious types of reverse, Eirene seated, 
of fine style, with the legend EIPHNH AOKPflN, and the later yet 
more remarkable subject of Roma seated while Pistis crowns her, the 
legend being PflMA III2TI2 AOKPON. There are beautiful coins 
of the little known town 01 Pandosia, bearing the head of the nymph 
Pandosia (?) ; the reverse has the river Crathis, a splendid head of the 
Lacinian Hera, and Pan. 

Rhegium was closely connected with Messene in Sicily opposite, 
and thus the great Sicilian currency of tetradrachms prevails. 
Anaxilaus, tyrant of Rhegium from 494 to 476 B.C., early in his rule 
acquired Messene through Samian adventurers. The coins of both 
towns at first present Samian types, and then, the Samians having 
been expelled, Anaxilaus commemorates his Olympic victory in the 
mule-car. The same type appears at Messene and last longer. 
In both cases the reverse bears a running hare, an animal which 
Anaxilaus introduced into Sicily. The later 5th-century coinage of 
Rhegium shows a seated figure of the Rhegine Demos, and a fine head 
of Apollo, by the engraver Hippocrates. 

The little-known town of Terina is illustriousas having produced 
a series of silver didrachms which, on the whole, is the most beautiful 
in Italy (PI. I. fig. 5). The obverse has the head of a goddess, who 
is portrayed winged on the reverse — a wonderfully fine subject, well 
conceived and most delicately executed in a variety of different 
attitudes, some recalling the^ Victories which adorn the balustrade 
of the temple of Wingless Victory at Athens. Very curiously, the 
money of Terina begins with an archaic coin which bears on the 
reverse the named figure of a Wingless Victory, surrounded by the 
olive-wreath. 

The coinage of Sicily is Greek. The Hellenic and Carthaginian 
colonies of the coast left the barbarous natives undisturbed in the 
inland country, and both issued Greek money, the 
Punic with a tincture of Phoenician style. The coinage 
ranges from the 6th century B.C. until the subjugation of the 
island by the Romans, after which a few cities struck colonial 
,or imperial coins for a short space. The marked periods are 
those of the preponderance of Syracuse from 480 to 212 B.C., 
interrupted by the great Carthaginian wars, which were fatal 
to the cities of the southern coast. The coinage is in gold 
and electrum, mainly issued at Syracuse, in silver and in bronze. 
The standard is Attic, except the earliest money of the Chalcidian 

	Sicily, 

colonies Himera, Zancle (Messene), and Naxos, which follows the 
Aeginetan weight. The metrology of Sicily has a distinct 
relation to that of Italy. Here also there is a double standard, 
silver and bronze, and in consequence an intrusive silver coin, 
differing but little from the obol, weighing 0-87 instead of -73 
grammes, the silver equivalent of the bronze litra, whose name 
it borrows. The litra in bronze was the Sicilian pound of 218 
grammes, equal to half an Attic mina, and to two-thirds of the 
Roman libra or pound. So important was the litra in Sicily 
that the silver litra supplanted the obol, and the didrachm was 
sometimes called a stater of ten litrae, the decadrachm a piece of 
fifty litrae, pentecontalitron. The leading coin is the tetra- 
drachm, not, as in Italy, the didrachm. 

The Sicilian money is of extremely careful artistic work, not 
unfrequently even in the case of bronze allowing for a more 
rapid execution of the die; and the highest technical excellence 
is attained. The art is that of the southern branch of the great 
Western school, generally more skilful than the art of southern 
Italy, but less varied. The earlier fine work has a naive beauty 
peculiar to the West and almost confined to Sicily; all that 
follows is evidently gem-engravers' work. These coins are 
remarkable for the frequency of artists' signatures, which for 
the short period of highest skill are almost universal on the 
larger silver money of Syracuse, and occur less frequently on 
that of the other great cities. Among these artists may be 
mentioned Exacestidas (at Camarina), Eucleidas, Eumenes, 
Phrygillus (at Syracuse), Euacnetus (Syracuse, Camarina, 
Catana), Cimon (Messana, Syracuse PI. I. figs. 7, 8), Heracleidas 
and Choirion (Catana). As in Italy, the decline is more rapid 
than elsewhere in the Greek world, in consequence of the 
inherent weakness of the style; but it is in part due to the 
calamities of the island, as of lower Italy. 

The fame won by the tyranni and other leading aristocrats of 
Sicily in the great national contests of Hellas, in the race with 
the quadriga, the mule-car and the horse, led to the introduction 
and supremacy of types commemorating these victories, probably 
in most cases those achieved at Olympia. It is obvious that no 
success could be so appropriately figured on the coinage; the 
charioteer or the horseman, not the city, was the victor, but at 
the same time the renown of the city was indissolubly connected 
with the citizen who won it. Hence these types are almost 
confined to states ruled by tyranni or oligarchies; outside Sicily 
they are practically only found at Rhegium when it was closely 
connected with Sicily, at Cyrcne, in the money of Philip II. of 
Macedon and at Olynthus and in Euboea. The horseman is not 
a frequent type; the mule-car is limited to Messene (and 
Rhegium); but the quadriga becomes the stereotyped subject 
for the reverse of the great Sicilian tetradrachms — the bulk of 
the coinage — and only escapes heraldic sameness by a charming 
variety in the details. In the age of finest art a divinity of the 
city takes, in Homeric guise, the place of the charioteer, or 
Victory herself so wins the contest; commonly she hovers 
above, about to crown the charioteer or the horses. Yet more 
interesting are the types connected with nature- worship, 
especially those portraying river-gods in the form of a man- 
headed bull, or a youth with the budding horns of a calf, or in the 
shape of a dog, and also the subjects of the nymphs of fountains. 
These types occur on either side of the coin. On nearly all, 
one side (in early times the reverse, later the obverse) is held by 
the head of a divinity, Persephone and Athene taking the first 
place. 

The leading position which Syracuse held in the island makes 
it proper to notice her splendid currency first, the finest for 
knowledge of the materials, for skill in suitably filling 
the space, and for delicacy of execution in the whole 
range of Greek money, though we miss the noble simplicity 
of Greece, the strong feeling of western Asia Minor, and the 
simple picturesqueness of Crete. Syracuse was founded in 
734 B.C. by Archias of Corinth, an origin which, remembered 
on both sides, served her well in later history. In the 6th 
century, perhaps while still under the oligarchy of the Geomori, 
she issued her most archaic silver money, which, primitive as 
it is, gives promise of the care of the later coinage, and begins 
the agonistic types, thus indicating some early victory at a great 
Hellenic contest. Gelo, tyrant of Gela, won the chariot race at 
Olympia in 488 B.C., secured Syracuse' in 485 B.C., and, when 
the Carthaginians, probably by agreement with Xerxes, invaded 
Sicily, utterly routed them at the great battle of Himera (480 
B.C.), the Salamis of the West. These events find their record 
in the issue and subjects of his Syracusan money, which, however, 
was struck, as usual in that age, in the name of the people. 
The chariot type is varied, for Victory appears hovering above 
the charioteer, about to crown the horses, and the coins issued 
after the great battle show the lion of Libya beneath the car in 
the exergue (PL I. fig. 6). These last pieces are fixed in date by 
the famous story how Gelo's wife Demarete, having gained 
favourable terms for the vanquished Carthaginians, was presented 
by them with a hundred talents of gold, by means of which 
were coined the great silver pieces of fifty litrae or ten drachms, 
which were called after her Demareteia. They bear the head of 
Victory, crowned with laurel, and the quadriga and lion. The 
battle of Himera and the death of Gelo (478 B.C.) fix the date of 
these remarkable coins, which close the archaic series of Syracuse 
and give us a fixed point in Greek art, at about 479 B.C. 

Hiero I. (478-466 B.C.), the brother and successor of Gelo, 
continues the same types, alluding, as Head well remarks (loc. 
tit.), to his great victory over the Etruscans off Cumae (474 B.C.), 
by the marine monster in the exergue of the reverse which 
denotes the vanquished maritime power. It is to be noted that 
as Gelo introduces the Victory in the chariot type, so in the 
horseman type we now first see Victory crowning the rider. 
Gelo had won an Olympic victory in the four-horse contest, 
Hiero in the horse-race, though he also won with the four horses 
in the Pythian games. With Hiero's money we say farewell 
to archaic art. The female heads on the obverse now have the 
eye in profile and show beauty and variety, and the horses are 
even exceptionally represented in rapid action. With the short 
rule of Thrasybulus, the last brother of the house, it came to an 
end, and the age of the democracy (466-406 B.C.) began. The 
victories by land and sea of Gelo and Hiero had established the 
power of the city on a sure basis, and fifty years of prosperity 
followed. To the earlier part of this age belong the beautiful 
transitional coins in which the female heads are marked by a 
youthful simplicity of beauty combined with fanciful and even 
fantastic treatment of the hair; the reverses remain extremely 
severe. Towards the close of this age, beginning about 430, 
there are very fine works, the first signed coins, with the old 
dignity yet with greater freedom of style, the horses of the 
quadriga in rapid movement. 

The victory of Syracuse in the contest with Athens was the 
occasion for the reissue of ten-drachm pieces, commonly but 
erroneously called medallions. On the reverses of these are a 
victorious chariot and a panoply of arms, representing the 
prizes offered at the games by which the Syracusans com- 
memorated the defeat of the Athenians on the Assinarus in 
413. On the obverses is the head of the local nymph Arethusa. 
The designs are by the artists Cimon (PI. I. fig. 8), Euaenetus, 
and a third w T ho is nameless. These pieces continued to 
be issued down to about 360 B.C. through the Dionysian 
period. Contemporary with them are numerous splendid tetra- 
drachms — signed and unsigned — as well as the first gold 
and bronze issued by Syracuse. The interference of Dion 
in Syracusan politics (357-353) was marked by the intro- 
duction of an electrum coinage, and of a silver didrachm of 
Corinthian type, corresponding in weight to the tridrachm of 
Corinth, and with the same types, the head of Athena and the 
Pegasus. The Dionysian dynasty closed in anarchy, until 
Syracuse appealed to Corinth, and Timoleon was sent to restore 
order (344 B.C.). His advent marks an epoch in Sicilian coinage. 
He restored the gold coinage and issued various silver col is 
which allude to Corinth and to liberty, and under his influence 
many small cities in Sicily awoke to political life as members of 
Timoleon's league and issued a scanty but interesting bronze 
coinage. The Syracusan democracy was overthrown in 317 B.C. 
and the city seized by Agathocles (317-289 B.C.), the worst 
of the tyrants of Syracuse. In the course of his reign he adopted 
the royal style, and his coins, a reflection of earlier work, give 
his name first without and then with the title king— a double 
innovation. The most interesting of his coins are those which 
bear allusions to his campaign in Africa. 

The tyrant Hicetas (288-280 B.C.) and the next ruler, Pyrrhus, 
king of Epirus (278-275 B.C.), continue the coinage, Pyrrhus 
issuing money in the name of the Syracusans and also striking 
his own pieces. The departure of Pyrrhus led to the establish- 
ment by Hiero II. (c. 270-216 B.C.) of a dynasty which, so long 
as he ruled, restored the ancient prosperity and preponderance 
of the rule of his namesake. At first content with inscribing 
his name alone, he soon not only takes the title of king, conferred 
on him in the early years of his reign, but also places his portrait 
on the money. Of his time is the beautiful portrait of his queen 
Philistis. The money of the short reign of Hieronymus (215- 
2 14 B.C.) and of the brief democracy which fell before the Romans 
(214-212 B.C.) close the independent series of this great city. 
But her name still appears in bronze money issued after the 
conquest. 

Taking the rest of the money of Sicily in alphabetical order, we 
first note a very fine bronze coin bearing a beautiful female head, 
perhaps that of Sicilia, crowned with myrtle, and a lyre, oth 
which belongs to the time of Timoleon 's league. This coin JLi 
is conjecturally attributed to Adranum. The first great ¥r* a 
town is Agrigentum, represented by archaic, transitional, Slc "y* 
and fine coins, the fine series ending with the overthrow of the city 
by the Carthaginians in 406 B.C. — a blow from which it never re- 
covered. The usual types are the eagle and the fresh- water crab, 
but in the age of finest art we see two eagles devouring a hare (cf. 
Aeschylus, A gam. 109 seq.) and a victorious chariot; these occur in 
the rare decadrachm (PI. I. fig. 9), on which the river-god Acragas 
himself drives the par, and the tetradrachms. The eagle is superior 
to that of Croton, inferior to that of Elis. Many of the bronze coins 
are of good work. The type most worthy of note is the head of a 
river-god, with the name Acragas, which was that of the local stream, 
and on the reverse an eagle standing on an Ionic capital, the Olympic 
turning-post. The success of Agrigentum at the games is attested by 
Pindar, while Virgil {Aen. \\\. 704), Gratius (Cyneg. 526) and Silius 
Italicus (xiv. 210) mention its ancient renown for horses. 

The money of Camarina is of especial beauty and interest. Camar- 
ina struck but few coins before the year of liberation (461), soon after 
which was issued a didrachm havingon the obverse a helmet upon a 
round shield and on the reverse a pair of greaves, between whicn is a 
dwarf palm. This piece is followed by tetradrachms and didrachms 
of the best period, most beautiful in style, and varying a little from 
difference of age. The tetradrachms bear on the obverse the head 
of Heracles in the lion's skin, and on the reverse Athena as a victor at 
the Olympic games in a quadriga. It was Athena, protector of the 
city (xoXidoxe IlaXX&s), whose sacred grove was made more illustrious 
by the success of Psaumis. The didrachms have on the obverse the 
head of a river-god, portrayed as a young man with small horns and 
with wet hair. Of the two rivers of Camarina, the Oanus and the 
Hipparis, the Hipparis is here represented, for in one case the name 
is given on the coin. Pindar seems to show the same preference, for, 
while he merely mentions the Oanus (xorajuAr . . . "flaw), he speaks 
of the sacred channels by which the Hipparis watered the city («mw& 
Sxtrofo, "Imrapts olaiv &p6ei arf>ar6v) t On the reverse the nymph 
Camarina ('ftceawi) Qvyartp . . . Kapaplva) is seen carried across 
her lake (£7x«pi<w \ • • . Wmw*) by a swan swimming with expanded 
wings, while she aids it by spreading her veil in the manner of a sail. 
Some of these didrachms have on either side, around the chief 
device, fresh-water fishes. The series of Catana comprises fine archaic 
tetradrachms and others of the time of the best art. The archaic 
tetradrachms have the types of a river in the form of a man-headed 
bull and of the figure of Victory, of a type remarkably advanced for 
the time at which they were^ struck. From 476 to 461, underthe 
name of Aetna, its coinage is represented especially by a unique 
tetradrachm (PI. I. fig. 10), with a wonderful head of Silenus, and Zeus 
as the god of the volcano holding a thunderbolt and a sceptre made 
of a vine-branch; before him is an eagle perched on one of the 
Aetnaean pines. The head of Apollo succeeds, with for reverse the 
victorious quadriga, in one case passing the turning-post, an Ionic 
column. Historically interesting is a small silver coin issued by 
Catana and Leontini in alliance between 405 and 403. Eryx towards 
the end of the 5th century produced some rare tetradrachms on 
which Eros is represented at the knees of his mother, asking for the 
dove which she holds. 

Gela is represented by coins of which the archaic tetradrachms 
must be especially mentioned. They have on the obverse the fore- 
part of the river-god Gelas, whence the city took its name. The Gelas 
is represented as a bull, havingthe face of a bearded man. On the 
reverse is a victorious quadriga, in some examples represented passing 
an Ionic column, as on coins of Catana. A beautiful tetradrachm 
represents the city goddess (Sosipolis) placing a wreath on the head 
of the monstrous river-god. A little later is a tetradrachm which has 
types of the head of the Gelas as a young man horned, surrounded 
by three fishes, and on the reverse Victory in a biga with a wreath 
above. Small gold coins, and a didrachm representing a Gcloan 
cavalryman spearing an Athenian hoplite, are among the coins issued 
shortly before the fall of Gela in 405. The money of Himera is of 
great interest. The oldest didrachms of Himera, which probably 
began in the 6th century B.C., bear on the obverse a cock and on the 
reverse an incuse pattern; later, a hen. During the time that Thero 
of Agrigentum held the city (before 480 to 472), the crab of 
Agrigentum appears on the didrachms. The transitional tetra- 
drachms bear on the one side a victorious quadriga and on the other a 
nymph sacrificing, near whom a little Silenus stands under the stream 
of a fountain issuing from a lion's head in a wall. Lcontini is repre- 
sented by tctradrachms with the'head of Apollo and the victorious 
car, which gives place to a lion's head. The series of Messenc begins, 
when the town was called Zancle, or, as it is written upon the coins, 
Dancle, with early drachms or smaller pieces of the Aegmetan weight, 
and of very archaic work. On the obverse is a dolphin, and around 
it a sickle; on the reverse the earliest pieces repeat the same design 
incuse (as in the earliest coinage of S. Italy), but later we find a shell 
in the midst of an incuse pattern. The place is said to have received 
its name on account of the resemblance of the harbour to a sickle 
(£6.yK\ov or fd7KXi?). Next to these first coins of Zancle may be 
placed, as the oldest piece of the Attic weight, a tetradrachm with 
the Samian types, a lion's scalp on one side and on the other the 
head of a calf, and bearing the inscription ME22ENI0N. This 
coin was doubtless struck during the rule of the Samians, who 
took the place about 494 B.C., at the instigation of Anaxilaus, tyrant 
of Rhegium, by whom they were subsequently excelled (Thucyd. 
vi. 4). The next pieces are the earliest of those which have on the 
obverse the mule-car and on the reverse a running hare, like the 
contemporary coins of Rhegium, with the same devices and equally 
of the rule of Anaxilaus. These types cease at Rhegium, though 
they continue at Mcssene, some of the tetradrachms bearing them 
being of the age of fine art. About 450 there must have been a 
temporary restoration of the Zancleans, who struck a tetradrachm 
with Poseidon and the dolphin as types. A fine piece of rather later 
date represents Pan caressing a hare. When the town had been seized 
(287 B.C.) by the Mamertini, money was struck with their name. 
Naxos is represented by early Aeginetic drachms with an archaic 
head of Dionysus. Immediately after the year of liberation (461) it 
produced a tetradrachm with a head of Dionysus and, on the reverse, 
a squatting Silenus, remarkable for the study of anatomical detail 
(see PI. I. fig. 11). These types are repeated in a less severe style some 
fifty years later, when also an engraver Procles signs some pretty 
didrachms. _ Segesta is represented by coins from about 480 B.C. 
We first notice the head of the nymph Segesta and a hound, probably 
the river-god Crimisus; then the same type for reverse associated 
with a young hunter accompanied by two hounds — a charming 
composition. Another interesting type is a victorious car driven by 
Persephone, who carries ears of corn. 

In the series of the city of Selinus the first coins are didrachms, 
bearing on the obverse a leaf and on the reverse an incuse square. 
The city and the river of the same name no doubt derived their 
name from the plant atkivov (probably wild celery, Apium graveolens) , 
the leaf of which must be here intended. Tetradrachms and 
didrachms of transitional and of good art have devices of more than 
usual interest. The obverse exhibits a river-god, sometimes the 
Selinus, sometimes the Hypsas, sacrificing at an altar to the god of 
healing, while on the didrachm a wading-bird is sometimes seen 
behind him, as if departing. The obverse of the didrachms shows 
Heracles subduing the bull, and the reverse of the tetradrachms 
generally shows a quadriga in which Apollo stands drawing his bow, 
while Artemis is charioteer. The reference in all these cases must be 
to the driving away of the pestilence from the neighbourhood of 
Selinus by the draining of the marshes. 

The Siculo-Punic coins, that is, those actually struck by the 
Carthaginians in Sicily, will best be dealt with under Carthage, 
below. 

The islands of Melita.Gaulos and Cossura near Sicily issued late 
coins which belong to the African series, showing a curious mixture of 
Phoenician and Egyptian elements in some of their types. Of Lipara 
there is heavy bronze money on the Sicilian system, having on the 
obverse a head of Hephaestus, or sometimes a figure of the same 
divinity seated, holding a hammer and a vase, which he seems to 
have just formed. 

In the Tauric Chersonese there are interesting coins, in the 
three metals, of the city of Panticapaeum, the modern Kertch. 
Their obverse usually bears the head of Pan and their 
Che**"'* reverse a g riffi n and other subjects; some are of fine 
Moaese, &c Greek style. The gold is of higher weight than usual, 
owing to the cheapness of the metal at this place. 
The money of Sarmatia, of Dacia, and of upper and lower 
Moesia, is chiefly bronze of the Graeco-Roman class. In 

	Thrace. 

Sarmatia we may notice the autonomous and imperial pieces 
of Olbia, which alone amongst Greek cities produced a series 
of cast bronze coins, and in Dacia the series bearing the name 
of the province. The Roman colonia Viminacium in upper 
Moesia is represented by numerous coins of a late time. Of 
Istrus, in lower Moesia, there are drachms having a strange type 
on the obverse, representing two beardless heads, side by side, 
the one upright and the other upside down; on the reverse is 
an eagle devouring a fish. The style of these coins is in general 
fair, though it sometimes approaches to barbarism. ApoIIonia 
Pontica produced fine silver coins with a head of Apollo and an 
anchor. There are abundant Greek imperial coins of Marciano- 
polis and Nicopolis, while Tomi is represented in this class as 
well as by autonomous money. 

The coins of Thrace are of high interest. Here and in Mace- 
donia we observe the early efforts of barbarous tribes to coin 
the produce of their silver mines, and the splendid 
issues of the Greek colonies; and we see in the weights 
the influence of the Asiatic Greeks and the Athenians. The 
oldest coins are of the early 5th century B.C., and there are 
others of all subsequent times, both while the country was 
independent and while it was subject to the Romans, until 
the cessation of Greek coinage. Some of the best period are of 
the highest artistic merit. So long as they maintain any general 
distinctive peculiarities of fabric and design, that is, from their 
commencement until the age of Philip, the Thracian coins 
resemble those of Macedonia. The money of Abdera comprises 
tetradrachms and smaller coins of the periods of archaic and 
fine art, all but the latest of the Phoenician standard, ultimately 
superseded by the Persic. The principal type is a seated griffin, 
copied from its mother-city, Teos. The reverse type, an incuse 
square, has at first four divisions, but in the age of the finest 
art contains a variety of beautiful subjects, the signets of the 
magistrates. Aenus is remarkable for the great beauty of some 
of its coins. These are tetradrachms of Attic weight, of the late 
archaic and best ages. The interesting turning-point from growth 
to maturity is seen in a vigorous head of Hermes in profile, 
wearing the petasus. A little later is the splendid series of 
facing heads, the broad, severe, and sculptural treatment of 
which is truly admirable, and far superior to the more showy 
handling of the same subject in later drachms. A goat is the 
reverse type of the larger coins. The money of the city of 
Byzantium begins with coins on the Persic standard of good 
style, having on the obverse a bull above a dolphin and on the 
reverse an incuse square of four divisions, and closes with the 
series of bronze coins issued under the empire. The star and 
crescent type first appears in the Roman period. Of Maronea, 
anciently famous for its wine, there is an interesting series, 
among which we notice fine tetradrachms of Phoenician weight, 
having on the obverse a prancing horse and on the reverse a 
vine within a square. The standard changes to Persic, of which 
there is a beautiful series of didrachms. Then the series is in- 
terrupted by the rule of the Macedonian kings, and resumed in 
a barbarous coinage of the native Thracians, issued in the second 
and first centuries before the Christian era, consisting of spread 
Attic tetradrachms with the types of the head of beardless 
Dionysus crowned with ivy and on the other side his figure. 
The Greek imperial coins of Pautalia and Perinthus are worthy 
of notice. Among those of the latter town we may mention 
fine pieces of Antoninus Pius and Severus, and large coins, 
commonly called medallions, of Caracalla and other emperors. 
The money of the imperial class issued by Philippopolis, Serdica 
and Trajanopolis should also be noticed. In the Thracian 
Chersonese the most important series is one of small autonomous 
silver pieces, probably of the town of Cardia. There is a limited 
but highly interesting group of coins of Thracian kings and 
dynasts. The earliest are of kings of the Odrysae, including 
Sparadocus and Seuthes I., who began to reign in 424 B.C., 
and whose money bears the two remarkable inscriptions 2EY0A 
KOMMA and SEY0A APITPION. It closes with the issues of 
Roman vassals, such as Cotys IV. (a.d. 12-19). Lysimachus, 
commonly classed as king of Thrace, belongs to the group of 

	Macedonia* 

Alexander's western successors (see below). Among the islands 
of Thrace, Imbros with its trace of Pelasgic worship, and, equally 
with Lemnos, showing evidence of Athenian dominion, and 
Samothrace with the Asiatic worship of Cybele yield in interest 
to Thasos. Here a long and remarkable currency begins with 
very early Persic didrachms, the obverse type a Silenus carrying 
a nymph, the reverse an incuse square of four divisions. Under 
the Athenian supremacy we see a decline of weight, and in style 
the attainment of high excellence. After this we observe coins 
of Phoenician weight, bearing for their obverse types the head 
of Dionysus. These are of the best period of art, and some 
tetradrachms are among the very finest Greek coins. The head 
of Dionysus is treated in a sculptural style that is remarkably 
broad and grand. The massive, powerful features, and the formal 
hair, nearly falling to the neck in regular curls like those of the 
full beard, are relieved by a broad wreath of ivy-leaves, designed 
with great delicacy and simplicity. The reverse bears a Heracles 
kneeling on one knee and discharging his bow — a subject 
powerfully treated. Of a far later period there are large 
tetradrachms, much resembling those of Maronea, with the 
same type of the beardless Dionysus, but on the reverse 
Heracles. 

The money of Macedonia both civic and regal is of great 
variety and interest. It begins at an early time, probably 
towards the end of the 6th century B.C. The old pieces 
are of silver, bronze having come into use a century 
later, and gold about the middle of the 4th century 
B.C. The character of the coinage resembles that of Thrace; 
the earliest pieces are of the Phoenician, Babylonic and Attic 
standards. The most remarkable denominations are the pieces 
of eight and twelve Phoenician drachms. The largest coins are 
of the time of Alexander I. (498-454), and somewhat earlier, 
and indicate the metallic wealth of the country more than its 
commercial activity. The chief groups of coins are those of the 
Pangaean, Bisaltian, Strymonian and Chalcidian districts, of 
the kings of Macedon and Paeonia, and of Macedon under the 
Romans. This last series begins with the coins of the " regions ** 
issued by permission of the senate and bearing the name of the 
Macedonians, from 158 to 150 B.C.; these are followed by coins 
of the Roman generals against Andriscus and of the pretender 
himself, and, from 146 onwards, of the Roman province. Under 
the empire a large series of bronze coins was issued in the name 
of the Koinon, i.e. the provincial diet. As regards the earlier 
civic coinage: the coinage of Acanthus comprises fine archaic 
tetradrachms of Attic weight and others of ( Phoenician weight 
and very vigorous in style, of the commencement of the period 
of good art. The type of their obverse is a lion seizing a bull 
(cf. Herodot. vii. 125 f.). The money of Aeneia is chiefly interest- 
ing from its bearing the head of the hero Aeneas; and on one 
extraordinary coin of archaic fabric, an Attic tetradrachm, the 
subject is the hero carrying Anchises from Troy, preceded by 
Creusa carrying Ascanius; this is in date before 500 B.C.. The 
town of Amphipolis is represented by a long series. There are 
Phoenician tetradrachms of about 400 B.C. having on the obverse 
a head of Apollo, facing, sometimes in a splendid style, which 
recalls the art of the immediate successors of Pheidias (PL I. fig. 
12). The reverse type is a flaming race- torch in an incuse square. 
The territory of Chalcidice is eminent for the excellence of some 
of its silver coins. There is a very early Attic tetradrachm of 
Olynthus, with a quadriga, and an eagle within a double square, 
which reminds us of the idea of the great Sicilian currencies, 
the record of Olympic victory. The Phoenician tetradrachms 
of the best period struck by the Chalcidian League (392-379 B.C., 
and later), Olynthus being probably the mint, are of great stylistic 
interest (PI. I. fig. 13). The obverse bears the head of Apollo in 
profile crowned with laurel. It is in very high relief and treated 
with great simplicity, though not with the severity of somewhat 
earlier pieces. The delicacy of the features is balanced by the 
simple treatment of the hair and the broad wreath of laurel. 
On the reverse is a lyre. There is an early series of coins of Lete, 
none later than about 480. The obverse type is a satyr with a 
nymph, and on the reverse is an incuse square divided fourfold, 
first diagonally and then in squares. Mcnde has money of Attic 
weight, the types being connected with Silenus, who on a tetra- 
drachm of fine style is portrayed reclining, a wine- vase in his 
hand, on the back of an ass; the reverse bears a vine. Of 
Neapolis (Datenon) there are early coins with the Gorgon's 
head and the incuse square, which in the period of fine art gives 
way to a charming head of the " Virgin Goddess " crowned with 
olive. The coins of Philippi in the three metals arc mainly of 
the time of Philip II., who, having found a rich gold mine near 
Crenidcs, changed its name to Philippi. The gold coins are 
Attic staters, the silver pieces of the Phoenician or Macedonian 
weight, like Philip's own money. The earliest bear the name of 
the " Thasians of the Mainland," who immediately preceded 
Philip's colony. All bear the head of young Heracles in a lion's 
skin, and a tripod. Imperial pieces were struck by the city as 
a colonia. There is a long but late series of Thessalonica which 
in the time of the regions was the mint of the second region; 
the numerous bronze coins of the Roman period show a figure of 
Cabirus among other types. Uranopolis has a few coins with 
very curious astronomical types, probably issued by the eccentric 
Alexarchus, brother of Cassander. The issues of the Thraco- 
Macedonians are extremely interesting. They are all just 
anterior to, or it may be contemporary with, Alexander I. of 
Macedon. The leading coins are octadrachms of the Phoenician 
standard. They have usually but one type, the reverse bearing 
a quadripartite incuse square. Their sudden appearance and 
heavy weight are due to the working of the silver mines on the 
border of Macedonia and Thrace. The usual types are a warrior 
leading a horse or a yoke of oxen. The coins bear the names of 
the Bisaltae, Getas, king of the Edoni, the Orrescii and other 
tribes. Besides these there are very curious Attic decadrachms 
of the Derronians of Sithonia, bearing the unusual type of an 
ox-car, in which is a figure seated, and on the reverse a symbol 
of three legs. 

The oldest coins of the Macedonian kings are of Alexander I., from 
498 to 454 B.C., the contemporary of Xerxes. These are Phoenician 
octadrachms, having on the obverse a cavalryman by the Kinrsot 
side of a horse, and coins of a lower denomination with the ^face- 
same or a similar type. The money of Alexander's aoala, 
successors illustrates^ the movement of art, but it is not^ 
until the reign of Philip II. that we have an abundant coinage. He 
first strikes gold pieces, chiefly Attic didrachms, from the produce of 
his mine near Philippi (PI. I . fig. 14). They are of fair style, and bear on 
the obverse the head of Arcs. On the reverse is a victorious Olympic 
biga. These coins were afterwards known as 4>iMxt€ioi and the gold 
money of Alexander as 'AX^AvSpooi — appellations which probably 
did not include larger or smaller pieces. Horace calls the gold coins 
of Philip " Philips (" resale nomismaPhilippos," Epist. 11. I, 232). 
The silver coinage of Philip is mainly composed of tetradrachms 
of the Phoenician standard (PI. I. fig. 15). Their type of obverse is a 
head of Zeus and of reverse either a horseman wearing a causia or a 
victor in the horse-race with a palm — these last coins being the best 
of Philip's, although the horse is clumsy. 

The coinage of Alexander the Great, both in the number of the 
cities where it was issued and in its abundance, excels all other 
Greek regal money; but its art is, without being despicable, far 
below excellence. The system of both gold and silver is Attic. The 
gold coins are distaters or gold tetradrachms, staters or didrachms 
(see PI. I. fig. I7),'hemistaters or drachms, with their half or a smaller 
denomination. The types of the distaters or staters, which last were 
the most common pieces, are for the obverse the head of Athena and 
for the reverse Victory bearing a naval standard. # The largest silver 
piece is the decadrachm, which is of extreme rarity. The types of 
the tetradrachms and most of the lower coins are on the obverse the 
head of Heracles in the lion's skin and on the reverse Zeus seated, bear- 
ing on his hand an eagle (PI. I. fig. 16). The head has been supposed 
to be that of Alexander, but this is not the case, although there may 
be some assimilation to his portrait. The great currency was of 
tetradrachms. The coinage was struck in different cities, dis- 
tinguished by proper symbols and monograms. The classification of 
the series is difficult, but is gradually advancing. (For Alexander's 
Eastern coinage see § iv. Oriental Coins.) 

The coinage of Alexander is followed by that of Philip Arrhidaeus, 
with the same types in gold and silver. That of Alexander IV. was 
issued by Ptolemy I. alone. In these coins the types of Alexander 
were modified, the dead king being represented with the ram's hop 
of Ammon, and wearing an elephant's skin head-dress and aegis. 
Meanwhile Seleucus, Lysimachus, Antigonus, king of Asia, struck 
Alexander's money with their own names, and the tetradrachms of 
Macedonia were generally of this kind until the time of Philip V. 
The same coinage, marked by a large flat form, was reissued later by 

Thessaly* 

various cities, especially of western Asia, when the Romans, after the 
battle of Magnesia in 190 B.C., restored the liberties which Alexander 
had granted. The series of Alexandrine money is interrupted by 
various small coinages and the later issues of Lysimachus, king of 
Thrace, with a fine portrait — head of Alexander with the ram's horn, 
as the son of Zeus Ammon, a work sometimes worthy of Lysippus 
and an excellent indication of his style. The reverse has a figure of 
Athena holding a little Victory (PL I. fig. 19). The coins of Demetrius 
I. (Poliorcetes) comprise fine tetradrachms, some of the types of which 
have an historic reference. They bear either on the obverse his 
portrait with a bull's horn and on the reverse a figure of Poseidon, or 
on the one side a winged female figure (Victory) on the prow of a 
galley, blowing a trumpet, and on the other Poseidon striking with 
his trident. The latter types cannotbe doubted to relate to the great 
naval victory which Demetrius gained over Ptolemy in 306; the 
Victory reproduces the " Victory of Samothrace," dedicated by 
Demetrius and now in the Louvre.^ The tetradrachms of Antigonus 
I. (Gonatas), which are of inferior style and work to those of 
Demetrius, have types which appear to refer in like manner to the 
great event of his time. The obverse type is a Macedonian buckler 
with the head of Pan in the midst, and the reverse type Athene 
Promachos. The head of Pan is supposed to have been taken as a 
device in consequence of the panic which led to the discomfiture of 
the Gauls at Delphi. Another pair of types, the head of Poseidon 
and Apollo seated on the prow of a warship, probably refers to the 
victory of Leucolla about 258 B.C. The tetradrachms of Philip V. 
have on the obverse a head in the helmet of Perseus, representing 
probably Philip's son, Perseus, in the character of that hero. The 
reverse bears a club. Other tetradrachms and smaller coins have a 
simple portrait of Philip. The tetradrachms of Perseus are of fair 
style, considering the time at which they were struck. They bear 
on one side the lung's head and on the other an eagle on a thunder- 
bolt. Andriscus (Philip VI., 150-149 B.C.) issued tetradrachms some 
of which represent him as Perseus. The coins of the Paeonian kings 
(from about 359 to 286 B.C.) show Macedonian influence, but are 
semi-barbarous. 

The coin systems of northern Greece, Thessaly, Epirus, 
Corcyra, Acarnania and Aetolia present certain difficulties 
which disappear if we consider them as originally 
Aeginetan, modified in the west by Corinthian, and 
later by Roman, influence. The coinage of Thessaly represents 
very few specimens of a remote period, while pieces of the best 
time are numerous. These are in general remarkably like the 
finest coins of Sicily and Italy, although the style is simpler. 
The prevalence of the horse and horseman is significant. The 
money of the Thessalian Confederacy, being of late date (196- 
146 B.C.), is of little interest. The commonest types are the head 
of Zeus crowned with oak and the Thessalian Athena Itonia in 
a fighting attitude. The coinage is resumed in imperial times. 
Numerous small places, such as Gomphi, Homolium, Lamia, 
Phalanna, produced coins of considerable beauty; more exten- 
sive are the issues of Pharsalus, Pherae (with fine coins of the 
tyrant Alexander), and especially Larissa. The last series begins 
with archaic pieces and some of the early period of good art, 
but sometimes of rather coarse execution. The small silver 
pieces Iiave very interesting reverse types relating to the nymph 
of the fountain, and to be compared for mutual illustration 
with the didrachms of Terina and with some of those of Elis. 
These are followed by coins of fine work. The usual obverse 
type is the head of Larissa, the nymph of the fountain, facing, 
and on the reverse is generally a horse, either free or drinking. 
The head is treated in a very rich manner, like that of the 
fountain-nymph Arethusa, facing, on tetradrachms of Syracuse; 
indeed, the debt to the Sicilian type is obvious. The bronze money 
is also good. The wine-producing island of Peparethus, off the 
Thessalian coast, is represented by a remarkable series of Attic 
tetradrachms (about 500-480 B.C.) with a variety of types, 
partly Dionysiac. 

The coinage of lllyria (strictly Illyris or Illyricum) is usually of 
inferior or rude art; the pieces are Aeginetic, ultimately changing to 
.... Corinthian, and then, in 229 B.C., to the standard of the 

r Roman Victoriatus. Of Apollonia there is a large series. 

The earliest (early 4th century) have the Corcyraean types of the 
pow and the calf and the floral pattern; the latest, usually the 
head of Apollo and three nymphs dancing round a fire, the outer 
ones holding torches. Dyrrhachium, which never bears on its coins 
the more famous name of Epidamnus, is represented by an im- 
portant series. First there are reduced Aeginetan didrachms with 
Corcyraean types. These are succeeded by tridrachms with 
Corinthian types, and of Corinthian weight; and then the old types 

are resumed, but the standard is that of the victoriatus. Dyrrhachium, 
it must be remembered, was founded partly by Corcyraean and partly 
by Corinthian colonists. The Nlyrio^Epirote mining towns, Damas- 
tium, &c, struck barbarous silver coins in the 4th century; on some 
of the small pieces we see an ingot of metal or a miner's pick. 

The coins of Epirus are of higher interest and beauty than those of 
lllyria. Of the Epirots there are bronze coins of the regal period 
(342-272 B.C.), and both silver and bronze of the republic 
(238-168 B.C.), with the heads of the Dodonaean Zeus and Epirus. 
Djone, together or apart. Ambracia is represented by silver pieces, 
with on the one side a head of Dione, on the other the obelisk of 
Apollo Agyieus. 

The series of Greek imperial money of Nicopolis must also be 
mentioned. The coinage of the kings begins under Alexander I. 
His coins have been found in the three metals, but they are rare. It 
is probable that both gold and silver were struck in Italy while he 
was in that country. The coins of Pyrrhus in all metals are of high 
interest, and remarkable for their beauty, though the style is usually 
florid. Thjere can be little doubt that they were for the most part 
struck in Italy and Sicily, at Tarentum and Syracuse. The tetra- 
drachm has for the type of the obverse a head of the Dodonaean Zeus 
crowned with oak and for that of the reverse Dione seated. A fine 
didrachm bears on the obverse a head of Achilles helmeted, with for 
the reverse Thetis on a sea-horse carrying the shield of her son. 
Among the copper coins of Pyrrhus we must remark the beautiful 
ones with the portrait of his mother Phthia. 

.The coinage of the island of Corcyra begins with very early reduced 
Aeginetic didrachms and drachms of the 6th century. The types are 
the cow suckling the calf and the floral pattern, as at 
Dyrrhachium. These leading subjects are varied in later Corcyra. 
times a by others illustrating the Corinthian origin of the nation, its 
maritime power, and the fame of its wine. Not the least curious are 
the bronze pieces with galleys bearing their names, as Freedom, 
Glory, Orderly Government, Corcyra, Comus, Cypris, Victory, Youth, 
Preserver, Fame, Light-bearer. The abundant bronze series goes on 
under the emperors. 

The coins of Acarnania are not remarkable for beauty or for 
variety in their types. The money of several cities in the 4th 
century B.C. is Corinthian in types and weight. That of 
the Acarnanian League (229-168 B.C.) bears the head of Acar~ 
the Acheloiis as a man-headed bull and the seated Apollo aania. 
Actius. Of Leucas the silver coins show the archaic cultus-figure 
of Aphrodite Aeneias. 

In Aetolia the gold and silver coins of the Aetolian League have 
some merit (279-168 B.C.). The gold pieces have on the obverse the 
head of Athena or that of Heracles in the lion's skin and on 
the reverse Aetolia personified, seated on Gaulish and Aetolia. 
Macedonian shields (a figure dedicated after the repulse of the 
Gauls; Paus. x. 18, 7). These subjects recur, with others indicating 
the hunter-life of the population, on the silver money; of especial 
interest are the head 01 Atalanta and the Calydonian boar, and the 
spear-head with which he was slain. On some of the copper the spear- 
head and^ the jaw-bone of the boar are seen. 

The coinage of Locris,Phocis and Boeotia is entirely on theAeginetic 
standard. The^coins of the Locri Epicnemidii are mainly didrachms, 
struck at Opus, with the head of Persephone and the 
figure of the Lesser Ajax in a fighting attitude, sometimes Locris. 
accompanied by his name. These coins were struck between 369 
and 338 B.C., and are remarkable for the manner in which a Syracusan 
head is copied, if indeed the dies were not actually in some cases made 
in the western city. 

The money of Phocis begins at a very early age, some time in the 
6th century B.C., and extends in silver down to the conquest by 
Philip (346 B.C.). The prevalent type is a bull's head. 
The generals Ony march us andPhalaecus in the Sacred War Pnocts. 
placed their names on bronze coins. Delphi, geographically included 
in Phocis, strikes very remarkable money,wholly distinct in types from 
the Phocian. The principal subjects are headsof rams and goats, the 
symbols of Apollo as apastoral divinity, a dolphin (Apollo Delphinius), 
the omphalos and tripod, and a negro's head, which has not been 
satisfactorily explained. The Amphictyonic Council struck beautiful 
didrachms, probably on the occasion of Philip's presidency (346 B.C.), 
with the head of Demeter, and the Delphian Apollo seated on the 
omphalos. Under Hadrian and the Antonines there is an imperial 
coinage of Delphi, some pieces bearing the representation of the temple 
of Apollo, on one type the letter E appearing between the columns of 
the face, representing the mystic Delphic EI, on which Plutarch wrote 
a treatise. 

The coinage of Boeotia is chiefly of a period anterior to the 
reign of Alexander, under whom the political importance of 
Thebes and the whole country came to an end. The 
standard until the end of the 4th century is Aeginetic. 
The main characteristic of the money is the almost exclusive use 
of the Boeotian shield as the obverse type, marking the federal 
character of the issues. These were struck by various cities, 
or by Thebes as ruling the League. The earliest pieces are 
drachms, presumably of Thebes, issued between 600 and 550 B.C. 

Boeotia, 

These are followed by didrachms of the same and other cities 
until the time of the Persian War. The result of the unpatriotic 
policy of Thebes and most of the towns of Boeotia was the 
degradation of the leading city, and the coins reveal the curious 
fact that Tanagra for a time became the centre of the League- 
coinage. We now notice the abandonment of the old incuse 
reverse and the adoption of regular types, the wheel at Tanagra 
and the amphora at Thebes. These types increase, and indicate 
several cities during the short period of Athenian influence 
(456-446 B.C.). The democratic institutions were next over- 
thrown, and Thebes became again the head of Boeotia, and 
struck alone and in her own name, not in that of the League. 
To the earlier part of this period belong splendid didrachms with 
reverse types chiefly representing Heracles, subsequently varied 
by heads of Dionysus in a series only less fine. With, the peace 
of Antalcidas (387 B.C.) Thebes lost her power, the League was 
dissolved, and the other Boeotian cities issued a coinage of some 
merit. In 379 B.C. Thebes became the chief state in Greece, 
and the patriotic policy of Pelopidas and Epaminondas is shown 
in the issue of the Boeotian coins at the great city without any 
name but that of a magistrate. Among those which occur is 
EIIAM, or EIIAMI. who can scarcely be any other than the 
illustrious general (PI. I. fig. 18). After the battle of Chaeronea 
(338 B.C.), swiftly followed by the destruction of Thebes, the 
coinage is comparatively unimportant, save only for the appear- 
ance of new league-money of Attic weight, with the head 
of Zeus and the figure of Poseidon, between 288 and 244 B.C. 

In Attica the great series of Athens is dominant. Eleusis 
issued a small bronze coinage of good style in the 4th century. 
Oropus and the island of Salamis also had an unim- 
portant coinage. The Athenian coinage, apparently 
introduced by Solon, begins with didrachms on the Eubcic 
standard, which, owing to the fame of the Athenian money, 
received the name of Attic. The type is an owl, the reverse 
having only the incuse square. These didrachms were suc- 
ceeded under Peisistratus by the well-known Attic tetradrachms 
with head of Athena on the obverse, and owl and olive-spray on 
the reverse (PI. I. fig. 20). The change supposed to have been 
introduced by Hippias (Pseudo-Arist. Oecon. ii. 4) was merely one 
of nomenclature; by calling in the coinage and reissuing it at 
double its old nominal value he only paid back half of what he 
had received. To what had previously been called didrachms 
he gave the name of tetradrachms, by which they have since 
been known. An obol bearing the name of Hippias himself, 
and types similar to those of Athens, was probably issued by 
him during his exile. From the time of the Persian wars the 
helmet of Athena is adorned with three olive-leaves. A rare 
decadrachm corresponds at Athens to the Demareteia at Syra- 
cuse, and was probably issued for similar reasons in commemora- 
tion of victory over the barbarians. Otherwise historical events 
seem to have left little record in the coinage and the Athenians 
deliberately affected archaism in the style of their coins, which 
bear no mark cf the splendour of Athens as the centre of the 
sculptor's art. No doubt commercial reasons dictated this 
conservative policy, which makes the coinage of Athens a 
disappointment in numismatics. Her money was precious for 
its purity not only in the Greek world but among distant bar- 
barians, so that imitations reach us from the Punjab and from 
southern Arabia , and any change would have injured its wide 
reception. There are many divisions of silver coinage with the 
types a little varied, and some different ones; and towards the 
end of the 5th century (probably in 407 B.C.) gold and bronze 
were introduced. The gold, of good quality and bad style, was 
never plentiful. The Macedonian empire put an end to the 
autonomy of Athens, and when the money is again issued it is 
of a wholly new style and the types are modified. The great 
series of spread tetradrachms maybe dated from about 229 B.C., 
and lasted probably until the time of Augustus. The obverse 
type is a head of Athena with a richly-adorned helmet, 
unquestionably borrowed from the famous statue by Pheidias in 
ivory and gold, but a poor shadow of that splendid original, and 
an owl on an amphora within an olive-wreath. The earliest coins 
have the monograms of two magistrates, the later the names of 
two who are annual (although the nature of their offices is not 
certain— possibly they were \eiTovpylcu), and, during the period 
146-86, a third name, of the treasurer of the prytany in which 
the coin was issued. Among the names are those of Antiochus 
(175 B.C.), afterwards Antiochus IV. of Syria, and of Mithradates 
the Great (PI. II. fig. 1) and his creature, Aristion (87-86 B.C.); 
but comparatively few of the coins can be dated exactly. Mithra- 
dates issued the only gold staters in this series. The symbols in 
the field often represent local statues of great interest. The 
abundance of this money shows the great commercial importance 
of Athens in these later times. Under the empire Athens issued 
only quasi-autonomous coins, but these are of great archaeo- 
logical value as they bear representations of the Acropolis, with 
the grotto of Pan, the statue of Pallas Promachus, the Parthenon, 
and the Propylaea, with the steps leading up to the latter; of 
the theatre of Dionysus, above which are caverns in the rock, 
and higher still the Parthenon and the Propylaea; and of 
various statues and groups of sculpture. Megara and other 
places in Megaris issued a small but interesting coinage. 

The money of the island of Aegina is of especial interest since 
with it coinage originated, so far as Greece proper is concerned, 
probably fairly early in the 7th century B.C. There 
is no good evidence for connecting the institution of **&**• 
the coinage with Pheidon, king of Argos, who established a 
system of measures and weights, known as the Pheidonian. 
The weight of the coins is of course on the Aeginetic standard. 
The oldest pieces are very primitive didrachms, bearing on the 
obverse a sea- tortoise and on the reverse a rude incuse stamp 
(PI. II. fig. 2). Afterwards the stamp becomes less rude, and later 
has a peculiar shape. The sea-tortoise is also replaced by a 
land-tortoise. There are some coins of the early part of the fine 
period of excellent work. The great currency was of didrachms. 
The bronze coins are not remarkable, but some appear to be of 
an earlier time than most Greek pieces in this metal. 

The series of Achaea begins under the Achaean League in 
the time of Epaminondas, with a fine Aeginetic stater and 
smaller coins in the name of the Achaeans. The later 
silver coins are either Attic tetrobols or Aeginetic * c ** A 
hemidrachms. On all but the earliest, i.e. after about 2S0 B.C., 
monograms or symbols indicate the cities which were members 
of the league; on the later bronze coins the names are given in 
full. The type of the silver is the head of Zeus Homagyrius, the 
reverse bearing the monogram of the Achaeans in a laurel- 
wreath. The oldest bronze lepeats the silver types; the later 
bear a standing Zeus and a seated Demeter, with the name of 
the city at full length. About forty-five cities are represented by 
this coinage. 

Corinth is represented by a very large series of coins, the weight 
of which is always on the Corinthian standard, equivalent to Attic 
but differently divided, — the Corinthian tridrachm, the 
chief coin, corresponding to the Attic didrachm. The 
oldest pieces, of the 6th century B.C. (some perhaps even earlier), 
bear on the obverse Pegasus with the letter ?, koppa, the initial 
of the name of Corinth, and on the reverse an incuse pattern. In 
course of time (about 500 B.C.) the head of Athena in an incuse 
square occupies the reverse. The incuse square disappears, as 
generally elsewhere, in the early period of fine art. Of the age 
of the excellence and decline of art we find beautiful work, 
though generally wanting in the severity of the highest Greek 
art (PI. II. fig. 3). Pegasus is ordinarily seen galloping, but some- 
times standing or drinking, the koppa is usually retained, and the 
helmet of Athena, always Corinthian, is sometimes bound with 
an olive-wreath. The smaller coins have the same reverse, but 
on the obverse a charming series of types, principally female 
heads, mostly representing Aphrodite. There are some drachms 
with Bellerophon in a combatant attitude mounted on Pegasus 
on the one side and the Chimaera on the other. The autonomous 
bronze money is poor, but often of fair work, and interesting, 
especially when the type relates to the myth of Bellerophon. 
In 46 B.C. this city was made a colonia; and we have a large 
and interesting series of the bronze coins struck by it as such, 
including the remarkable type of the tomb of Lais. The coins of 
the " colonies " of Corinth form a long and important series, 
struck by Acarnanian towns with Corcyra, and in the west by 
Locri Epizephyrii in Italy and Syracuse. Some of these cities 
were not strictly colonies of Corinth, but the Pegasus staters 
struck by them form a homogeneous group. They range from 
the time of Dion (357 B.C.) to nearly the end of the 3rd century. 
The coins are distinguished by the absence of the koppa, and 
bear the names or monograms of the cities. 

There are bronze coins of Patrae as an important Roman colonia, 
and silver and bronze money of Phlius, both of the period of good 
art. The coinage of Sicyon, on the Aeginetic standard 
Patrae, dominant in the rest of the Peloponnesus, is disappoint- 
Slcyoo, &c • £ or a f amous artistic centre. It begins shortly before 
the period of fine art; in that age the silver is abundant and well 
executed, but the leading types, the Chimaera and the flying dove 
within an olive-wreath, are wearying in their repetition, and good 
work could not make the Chimaera an agreeable subject. Small coins 
with types of Apollo are the only subjects which suggest the designs 
of the great school of Sicyon. 

The money of the Eleans is inferior to none in the Greek world in 
its art, which reaches the highest level of dignified restraint, and in the 
variety of its types, which are suggested by a few subjects. 
G The leading types are connected, as we might expect, with 

the worship of Zeus and Hera and Victory, the divinities of the great 
Panhellenic contest at Olympia, and the coinage is rather the money 
of Olympia than of the Eleans as a civic community. The prevalent 
representations are the eagle and the winged thunderbolt of Zeus, 
the head of Hera and the figure of Victory. The series begins early 
in the 5th century B.C. with coins, some of which are didrachms 
(Aeginetic), having as subjects an eagle carrying a serpent or a hare, 
and on the reverse a thunderbolt or Victory bearing a wreath — 
archaic types which in their vigour promise the excellence of later 
days. From 471 to 421 B.C., while Ehs was allied with the Spartans, 
such types continue; the eagle and Victory (sometimes seated) are 
both treated with great force and beauty, and the subject of seated 
Zeus is remarkable for its dignity. The Argive alliance (42 1-400 B.C.) 
seems marked by the pre-eminence given to Hera, whose head may 
suggest the famous statue of Polycleitus at Argos. About the same 
time was issued a didrachm with a noble head of Zeus (PI. II. fig. 4), 
which probably recalls, though it is not a copy of, the Zeus of Pheidias. 
This alliance broken, the old types recur. Magnificent eagles, some 
admirably designed on a shield, and eagles' heads (see PL II. fig. 5), the 
seated Victory, and fantastically varied thunderbolts mark this age. 
Among the artists' signatures at this time is AA, which may repre- 
sent the sculptor Daedalus of Sicyon. In 364 B.C. the coinage is 
interrupted for a year, the Pisatans, who conducted thefestival then, 
issuing small gold coins; these are immediately followed by Elean 
money with the heads of Zeus and the nymph Olympia. Aristotimus, 
who was tyrant in 272 B.C., issued coins with his initials. The coinage 
closes with imperial money, some types of which have a local interest, 
notably two of Hadrian bearing the head and figure of Zeus, copied 
from the famous statue by Pheidias. 

Cephallenia gives us the early silver coins of Cranii, the money of 
Pale, of charming style, with the figure of Cephalus on the^ reverse, 
Ce Hal- anc * *k at °* Same, all cities of this island. Of the island of 
p ' Zacynthus there are silver pieces, usually of rather coarse 
tenia, <sc wor k ( but sometimes of the style of the best Cephallenian 
money. Some struck in 357 bear the name of Dion of Syracuse, who 
collected the forces for his expedition in this island. The coins of 
Ithaca are of bronze. They are of interest on account of their 
common obverse type, which is a head of Odysseus. 

Returning to the mainland, we first notice the money of Messene, 
or the Messenians. The earliest coin is a splendid Aeginetic didrachm, 
M having on the obverse a head of Persephone, and excels in 
essen^ . design the similar subjects on the money of Syracuse, from 
which it must have been copied, for it is of about the time of Epamin- 
ondas. It shows the purer style of Greece, which, copying Syracusan 
work, raised its character. On the reverse is a figure or Zeus, inspired 
by the work of Hageladas. The other silver coins are of about the 
period of the Achaean League. The bronze money is plentiful, but 
Laconia. not interesting. Lacedaemon, as we might have expected, 
has no early coins, the silver money being mostly of the 
age of the Achaean League, but the King Areus (309-265 B.C.) and 
the tyrant Nabis (207-192 B.C.) are represented by Attic tetra- 
drachms. On a tetradrachm of the time of the former is a figure of 
the Apollo of Amyclae. Among the types of the autonomous bronze 
pieces may be noticed the head of the Spartan lawgiver Lycurgus, 
with his name. The series of Argos in Argolis begins early in the 
Arzolte. 5^ cent ury. The standard is Aeginetic. The first pieces 
^^ * are the drachm and smaller denominations with a wolf, 
half-wolf or wolf's head on the obverse, and A on the reverse. A rare 
iron coin was issued with these types. At the end of the 5th century 
begin the didrachms, which have for the obverse type the head of the 
Polycleitan Hera — a design which is not equal to that of the coins of 
Elis, the style being either careless or not so simple. The reverse 
type of the drachm represents Diomedes stealthily advancing with 
the palladium in his left hand and a short sword in his right. A 4th- 
century drachm of Epidaurus represents the famous seated figure of 
Asclepius by Thrasymedes of Paros. 

Of the money of Arcadia some pieces are doubtless among the 
most ancient struck by the Greeks; and the types of these and later 
coins are often connected with the remarkable myths of Arcadi 
this primeval part of Hellas, showing particularly the ** 

remains of its old nature-worship. The first series to be noticed is 
that of the Arcadian League; it begins about 500 B.C. with hemi- 
drachms having the type of Zeus Lycaeus seated, the eagle repre- 
sented as if flying from his hand, and a female head. Of a later time, 
from the age of Epaminondas, there are very fine coins (issued from 
Megalopolis) with the head of Zeus, and Pan seated. The coins of 
Heraea begin deep in the 6th century B.C. The earliest have for 
obverse type the veiled head of Hera, and pn the reverse the beginning 
of the name of the town. The silver coins of Mantinea (beginning 
early in the 5th century) have on the obverse a bear, representing 
Callisto, the mother of Areas, who was worshipped here, and on the 
reverse the letters MA, or three acorns, in an incuse square. Later 
coins, especially the bronze, have subjects connected with the worship 
of Poseidon at, this inland town. The silver coins of Pheneus must 
be noticed as being of fine work. The didrachms of the age of 
Epaminondas have a head of Persephone, and Hermes carrying the 
child Areas. The obverse type is interesting as a copy of the 
Syracusan subject, as in Locns and Messene. As in Locris, the 
merit is in the greater force and simplicity of the face, here most 
successful, the hair being treated more after the Syracusan manner 
than after that of the Messenians, who simplified the whole subject. 
The finest coin attributed to Stymphalus is a magnificent didrachm 
of the age of Epaminondas, with a head of the local Artemis laureate, 
and Heracles striking with his club. The smaller silver coins have 
on the one side a head of Heracles and on the other the head and neck 
of a Stymphalian bird. There were representations of these birds in 
the temple of Artemis. The series of Tegea is not important, but 
two of the reverse types of its bronze coins are interesting as relating 
to the myth of Tefephus and to the story that Athena gave a jar 
containing the hair of Medusa to her priestess Sterope, daughter of 
Cepheus, in order that she might terrify the Argives should they 
attack Tegea in the absence of Cepheus, when Heracles desired his 
aid in an expedition against Sparta. Iron coins were issued by Tegea, 
and also perhaps by Heraea. 

The peculiar position of Crete and her long isolation from 
the political, artistic and literary movements of Hellas have 
been already touched on. It is not until the age of 
Philip V. that Crete "appears in the field of history, 
and then only as the battle-ground of rival powers. The most 
remarkable influence of this age was when Athens, by the 
diplomacy of Cephisodorus, succeeded about 200 B.C. in drawing 
the Cretans into a great league against Philip V. of Macedon. 
That this project took actual shape is proved by the issue at 
all the chief mints of the island of tetradrachms with the well- 
known types of Athens, to be distinguished from the Atticizing 
types of other cities at this time. 

The oldest coins are probably of about 500 B.C., but few cities 
seem to have issued many until a hundred years later. Then 
there is a great outburst of coinage, sometimes beautiful, some- 
times barbarously careless, which lasts until the age of Alexander, 
when the local currency was probably in great part replaced by 
Alexandrine coins. At the end of the 3rd century the local 
coinages are revived until the Roman conquest (67 or 66 B.C.). 
The chief issue is of silver; bronze is less abundant; and gold 
is all but unknown. The Cretan types have a markedly local 
character, yet they copy in some instances other coinages. The 
chief divinities on the pieces are Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Heracles 
and Britomartis, and the leading myths are those of Minos, the 
story of the Minotaur and the labyrinth being prominent, and 
also that of Europa. There is frequent reference to nature- 
worship as in Sicily, yet with a distinctive preference for trees, 
the forms of which, however, lend themselves readily to the 
free representation of Cretan art, which may in part explain 
their prominence. The peculiarity of Cretan art lies in its 
realism. At some places, as Aptera, Polyrrhenium and Cydonia, 
we find engravers' signatures. The weight is at first Aeginetic 
of reduced form; and in the resumption of the coinage after 
Alexander's time it is Attic. 

Of the island in general there are Roman silver and bronze 
coins of the earlier emperors, some of which are of fine work 
I for the period. The most interesting types are Dictynna and 

Crete. 

Zeus Cretagenes. The autonomous coins are very varied. The 
obverse of the didrachms of Aptera bears a head of Artemis 
and the reverse a warrior (Ptolioikos) before a sacred tree. 
Of Chersonesus, the port of Lyctus, there are didrachms of coarse 
style, with a head of Artemis Britomartis, who had a temple at 
the place. The head is copied from Stymphalus, as also is one 
of the reverse types, Heracles wielding his club. The money of 
Cnossus is of great interest. The oldest coins may be as early 
as 480 B.C. They bear the figure of the Minotaur as a bull- 
headed man, kneeling on one knee, and a maeander-pattern, in 
one case enclosing a star (the sun), in another a head (Theseus?). 
Of the period 43i~35o there are didrachms with the head of 
Persephone, and the labyrinthine pattern enclosing the sun or 
the moon or a bull's head for the Minotaur, and at length be- 
coming a regular maze. To this time belongs the wonderful 
coin in the Berlin Museum with Minos seated, his name in the 
field, and the head of Persephone within the maeander-pattern. 
In the later 4th century a head of Hera (copied without spirit 
from the coins of Argos) occupies the obverse of didrachms and 
drachms, and the reverse has a maze through which the way may 
be clearly traced. This series closes with Alexander's empire, 
and the native coinage disappears until the league of Cephisodorus 
revives it with the Athenian tetradrachm of Attic weight, bearing 
the name of the Cnossians. It is of inferior style, and is followed 
by base coins with heads of Minos and Apollo, and the Labyrinth, 
either square as before or in a new circular form, which is 
interesting as showing it was a mere matter of tradition. 

There are interesting coins of Cydonia, some of them of beauti- 
ful style and work. One bears an engraver's name, Neuantos. 
The head is that of a Maenad, and the reverse has a figure of 
the traditional founder Cydon, stringing his bow, who on other 
didrachms is seen suckled by a bitch. The style is good, but 
the execution poor. Gortys, or Gortyna, is represented by 
most remarkable coins, which generally allude to the myth of 
Europa. t)idrachms of archaic style have on the obverse 
Europa carried by the bull and on the reverse the lion's scalp. 
These pieces are followed by a remarkably fine class of spread 
didrachms;' the best are of about 400 B.C. They have on the 
obverse Europa seated in a pensive attitude on the trunk of a 
tree, doubtless the sacred plane at Gortyna, mentioned by Pliny, 
which was said never to shed its leaves, and on the reverse a 
bull suddenly turning his head as if stung by a fly (PI. II. fig. 6). 
Nothing in Greek art exceeds the skill and beauty of these designs. 
The truth with which the tree is sketched, and the graceful 
position of the forlorn Europa are as much to be admired as the 
fidelity with which the bull is drawn, even when foreshortened, 
sharply turning his head, with his tongue out and his tail raised. 
These designs, beautiful in themselves, are strikingly deficient in 
fitness, and afford equally strong illustrations of the excellencies 
and of the one great fault of the art of Cretan coins. Many 
pieces of the same class are of rude execution. Of Itanus there 
are remarkable coins, the earlier, some of which are of good 
style, with the subject of a Tritonian sea-god (Glaucus?) and 
two sea-monsters. Lyctus (Lyttus) is represented by strangely 
rude pieces, with the types of a flying eagle and a boar's head. 
The coins of Phaestus form a most interesting series. Among 
the didrachms are some of admirable work, with on the obverse 
Heracles slaying the Hydra with his club and on the reverse a 
bull. Others have on the obverse Heracles seated on the ground, 
resting. Another noticeable obverse type is the beardless Zeus 
seated in a tree, with his Cretan name, Velchanos. On his knee 
is a cock crowing, showing that he was a god of the dawn. We 
also find Talos, the man of brass, said to have been made by 
Hephaestus or Daedalus, portrayed as a winged youth naked, 
bearing in each hand a stone, and in a combatant attitude. 
Apollonius Rhodius (Argonaut, iv. 1638 sqq.) relates that Talos 
prevented the Argonauts from landing in Crete by hurling stones 
at them, until he was destroyed by the artifice of Medea. The 
important town of Polyrrhenium is represented by carefully- 
executed coins with a head of Zeus and a bull's head. A later 
piece has a whiskered head of Apollo, probably Philip V. in that 
character. Priansus shows the remarkable type of Persephone 
seated beside a date-palm, placing her right hand on the head of 
a serpent in reference to the myth of the birth of Zagreus. As 
usual, the figure is foreshortened. The reverse has a standing 
figure of Poseidon. Rhaucus has Poseidon beside his horse. 
The rare didrachms of Sybritia, or Syhrita, may fitly close the 
series; one, among the most exquisite of Greek coins, has heads 
of Dionysus and Hermes in high relief (see PL II. fig. 7); 
another has on the obverse a charming subject, Dionysus seated 
on a running panther, and on the reverse Hermes drawing on 
his right buskin, — a delightful figure. Another beautiful type is 
a seated Dionysus. 

The coinage of Euboea is all on the native standard, of which the 
Attic was a variety. It includes some of the very earliest Greek 
money. Carystus begins in the time of the Persian War _, ., 
with the type of the cow and calf, as in Corey ra, and its ^ uboea * 
special badge is^ the cock. In the period 197-146 it issued gold 
drachms. Chalcis, the mother of western colonies, has already in the 
6th century, or even earlier, a long series with the wheel-type and an 
incuse diagonally divided, and later, a nymph's head and an eagle 
devouring a serpent. Eretria probabry begins as early as Chalcis, 
but the obverse type is the Gorgon's head. This is succeeded by the 
same type and a panther's or bull's head, and fine late archaic coins 
bear the cow and the cuttle-fish. Eretria was probably the mint of 
coins with the head of a nymph and a cow or cow's head struck in the 
name of Euboeans in the fine period. Of Histiaea the usual type is 
the head of a Maenad and a female figure seated on the stern of a 
galley. 

Among the other islands classed after Euboea, Amorgos must not 
be passed by, as a bronze coin of Aegialc, one of its towns, presents 
the curious type of a cupping-glass. To Andros has been c .. 
attributed a group of early coins bearing an amphora. ^J* 
The silver money of Carthaea, Corcssia and Iulis in Ceos 2!?—^, 
is extremely old, beginning in each case in the 6th century. p * 

The weight is Aeginetic, and there are didrachms and smaller coins. 
The usual types of Carthaea are an amphora and then a bunch of 
grapes j that of Coressia is a cuttle-fish and dolphin. The coinage of 
Delosis insignificant. Mclos coined from the early 5th century to 
imperial times: its chief type is a canting one, the /njW (pome- 
granate). Naxos is represented by early Aeginetic didrachms and 
coins of the firie period, the latter being chiefly bronze pieces of 
remarkably delicate and good work. The types are Dionysiac. A 
7th-century coin with the head of a satyr (one of the earliest repre- 
sentations of the human head on a coin) is probably Naxian. Of 
Paros there are early Aeginetic didrachms with the type of a kneeling 
goat and beneath a dolphin. Of the 3rd and 2nd centuries B.C. there 
are Attic didrachms with a head, possibly of Artemis, at first of a 
charming style, and a goat on the reverse. There are very archaic 
Aeginetic didrachms of Siphnos, which was famous for its gold and 
silver mines. A late tetradrachm of Syros is interesting as repre- 
senting the Cabiri. 

The coinage of Asia begins with that of Asia Minor. It falls 
into certain great classes — first, the ancient gold and clectrum, 
Lydian and Greek, in time succeeded by clectrum 
or gold and silver, all struck in the west and mainly Mi* r. 
on the coast. Then the Persian dominion appears 
in the silver money of the satraps, circulating with the gold 
and silver of Persia, and the Greek money is limited to a few 
cities of the coast, none save the elcctrum of the great mint of 
Cyzicus uninterrupted by the barbarian. With the decay of 
the barbarian empire the renewed life of the Greek cities is 
witnessed by a beautiful coinage along the coast from the 
Propontis to Cilicia. On Alexander's conquest autonomy 
is granted to the much-enduring Hellenic communities, and is 
again interrupted, but only partially, by the rule of his successors, 
for there was no time at which Asia Minor was wholly parcelled 
out among the kings, Greek or native. The Romans, after the 
battle of Magnesia (190 B.C.), repeated Alexander's policy so 
far as the cities of the western coast were, concerned, and there 
is a fresh outburst of coinage, which, in remembrance, follows 
the well-known types of Alexander. When the province of 
Asia was constituted and the neighbouring states fell one by 
one under Roman rule, the autonomy of the great cities was 
generally reduced to* a shadow. Still the abundant issues of 
imperial coinage, if devoid of high merit, are the best in style 
of late Greek coins, and for mythology the richest in illustration. 

The oldest money is the electrum of Lydia, which spread 
in very early times along the western coast. This coinage, 
dating from the 7th century B.C., has an equal claim 
with the Aeginetic silver to be the oldest of all money. 
Probably the two currencies arose at the same period, and by 
interchange became the recognized currency of the primeval 
marts; otherwise we can scarcely explain the absence 
coins e of Asiatic silver, though it is easy to expjain that of 
European electrum or gold. The electrum of the coins 
is gold — the precious metal washed down by the Pactolus — with a 
native alloy of a varying part of silver. Its durability recommended 
it to the Lydians, and it had (by convention) the advantage of 
exchanging decimally with gold, then in the ratio 13-3 to silver. 
But this commercial advantage allowed the issue of electrum 
coins on silver standards, while it was natural to coin them on 
those of gold; hence a variety of weight-systems perplexing 
to the metrologist. The classification of the earliest coins is 
exceedingly obscure; it is hardly possible to say which were 
struck in Lydia itself, which in the Greek coast cities, such as 
Miletus; but the majority probably belong to Greek mints. 
The most primitive in appearance are those in which the obverse 
is merely marked with lines, corresponding to the original rough 
surface of the die, while the reverse has three depressions, an 
oblong one flanked by two squares (PI. II. fig. 8); there are also 
various coins of small denomination with a plain convex obverse, 
and a single rough depression on the reverse, known from the 
excavations at Ephesus. Both the Babylonian and the Phoenician 
standards were in use in early times. This double currency, 
as Head suggests, was probably intended, so far as the Lydians 
were concerned, for circulation in the interior and in the coast 
towns to the west, the Babylonic weight being that of the land 
trade, the Phoenician that of the commerce by sea. Croesus 
(PI. II. fig. 9) abandoned electrum, and issued pure gold (on the 
Babylonic and gold-shekel standards), and pure silver(Babylonic), 
the silver stater exchanging as the tenth of the Euboic gold 
stater. These results are explained by the metrological data 
given earlier in this article. Of the Greek marts of the western 
coast we have a series of early electrum staters, for the most 
part on the Phoenician weight. An interesting homogeneous 
group was issued by the various cities which took part in the 
Ionian revolt (500-494 B.C.). The Euboic weight naturally found 
its way into the currencies, but was as yet limited to Samos. 
Phocaea, Teos and Cyzicus, with other towns, followed from a 
very early period the Phocaic standard, which for practical 
purposes may be called the double of the Euboic. They alone 
before Croesus issued gold money, which was superseded at 
Phocaea and Cyzicus by electrum. This is the main outline of 
the native coinage of Asia Minor before the Persian conquest. 
Its later history will appear under the several great towns, the 
money of Persia (which circulated largely in Asia Minor) being 
treated in a subsequent place. 

The first countries of Asia Minor are Bosporus and Colchis, 
the coins of the cities of which are few and unimportant. The 

autonomous coinages of the cities of Pontus are more 
co^w" 15 ' numerous J Dut the only place meriting a special 
Poatusl notice is Amisus, which almost alone of the cities of 

Pontus seems to have issued autonomous silver money. 
The common subjects of the bronze money of this place relate 
to the myth of Perseus and Medusa, a favourite one in this 
country. 

The regal coins are of the old kingdoms of Pontus and of the 
Cimmerian Bosporus, of the two united as the state of Bosporus 
and Pontus under Mithradates VI. (the Great), and as recon- 
stituted by the Romans when Polemon I. and II. still held the 
kingdom of Mithradates, which was afterwards divided into the 
province of Pontus and the kingdom of Bosporus. The early 
coinage of the kingdom of Bosporus is of little interest. Of that 
of Pontus there are tetradrachms, two of which, of Mithradates 
IV. and Phamaces I., are remarkable for the unflinching realism 
with which their barbarian type of features is preserved. Mith- 
radates VI., king of Bosporus and Pontus, is represented by gold 
staters, and tetradrachms. The portrait on the best of these 
(see PI. II. fig. 10) is fine despite its theatrical quality, character- 
istic of the later schools of Asia Minor. The kings of Bosporus 
struck a long series of coins for the first three and a half centuries 
after the Christian era. Their gold money (the only non-imperial 
gold allowed under the empire) is gradually depreciated and 
becomes electrum, and ultimately billon and bronze. They 
bear the heads of the king and the emperor, and are dated by 
the Pontic era (297 B.C.). 

In Paphlagonia we must specially notice the coins of the 
cities Amastris and Sinope. The silver pieces of the former 
place bear a youthful head in a laureate Phrygian 
cap, probably representing Mithras, Amastris, the ^/J 1 " 
foundress, being seated on the reverse. The silver 
pieces of Sinope are plentiful. In the 4th century they bear the 
names of Persian governors. The types are the head of the 
nymph Sinope and, as at Istrus, an eagle preying on a dolphin. 
Bithynia is represented by a more important series. 
The provincial diet issued Roman silver medallions 
of the weight of cistophori (to be presently described), with 
Latin inscriptions, and- bronze pieces with Greek inscriptions. 
The ordinary silver coins of Chalcedon strikingly resemble on 
both sides those of Byzantium, and a monetary convention 
evidently at times existed between these sister-cities. Of Cius, 
also called Prusias ad Mare, there are gold staters and smaller 
imperial silver pieces. Of Heraclea there are silver coins of 
good style; the most interesting type is a female head wearing 
a turreted head-dress, one of the earliest representations of a 
city-goddess (early 4th century). The tyrants of Heraclea, 
Clearchus, Satyrus, Timotheus and Dionysius are represented 
by coins. Of the imperial class there is a large series of Nicaea, 
and many coins of Nicomedia. The series of the Bithynian kings 
consists of Attic tetradrachms and bronze pieces, issued by 
Ziaelas, Prusias I. and II., and Nicomedes I -IV. 

The fine Greek coinage of Asia may be considered to begin 
with Mysia. Cyzicus is in numismatics a most important city. 
Its coinage begins in the 6th century; and the famous 
electrum Cyzicene staters were struck here for nearly y ** 

a century and a half (c. 500-^350 B.C.). During that whole period 
they were not only the leading gold coinage in Asia Minor but 
the chief currency in that metal for the cities on both shores of 
the Aegean; the value at which they were rated was doubtless 
a matter of convention, and varied from time to time. The 
actual weight is of the Phocaic standard, just over 248 grains. 
The divisions were the hecta or sixth, and the twelfth. The 
extraordinary variety of " types " at Cyzicus is due to the 
fact that these types are really symbols differentiating the issues, 
the true badge of the city, the tunny-fish, being relegated to a 
subordinate position (PL II. fig. 11). The reverse invariably has 
the quadripartite incuse square in four planes of the so-called 
mill-sail pattern. The coins are very thick and the edges are 
rude. The art is frequently of great beauty, though sometimes 
careless. The silver coinage of Cyzicus comprises beautiful 
tetradrachms of the Rhodian standard, with a head of Perse- 
phone SHTEIPA, veiled and wreathed with ears of corn. Both 
late autonomous and imperial coins in bronze are well executed 
and full of interest, the two classes running parallel under the 
earlier emperors. 

Lampsacus is represented by a long series of coins. Its 
distinctive type is the forepart of a Pegasus, which occurs on 
its coins from the 6th century onwards. In the first half of the 
4th century it issued splendid gold staters with various types 
(really, as at Cyzicus, symbols distinguishing the issues) on 
the obverse and the half-Pegasus on the reverse. The most 
remarkable type is a bearded head (probably of a Cabirus) with 
streaming hair in a conical cap, bound with a wreath, singularly 
pictorial in treatment as well as in expression (PI. II. fig. 12). In 
contrast to this is a most carefully executed head of a Maenad 
with goat's ear; and other types of great interest are the Earth- 
goddess rising from the earth, and Victory nailing a helmet to 
a trophy, or sacrificing a ram. 

The money of the great city of Pergamum is chiefly of a late 
time. Apart from some rare pieces of gold, the silver coinage 
is chiefly supplied by the money of the kings of Pergamum and 
by cistophori. The bronze pieces of the city are numerous, 
both autonomous and imperial, the two classes overlapping, 
and there are medallions of the emperors. The local worship of 
Aesculapius is especially promient under the Roman rule. The 
chief coins of the kings are Attic tetradrachms, with on the 
obverse a laureate head of Philetaerus, the founder of the state, 
and on the reverse a seated Athene, the common type of Lysi- 
machus, from whom Philetaerus revolted. Variations from 
these types are rare,the most important being a coin with the 
name of Eumenes (II.) , representing his portrait and the Dioscuri. 
Otherwise the inscription is always 4»IAETAIPOY. The cisto- 
phorus probably originated at Ephesus towards the end of the 
3rd century, but was soon adopted for the Pergamene dominions, 
and down to imperial times was the only important silver 
currency in Asia Minor. It acquired its name from its obverse 
type, the cista tnystica, a basket from which a serpent issues, 
the whole enclosed in an ivy-wreath. The reverse type repre- 
sents two serpents, and between them usually a bow-case (PL 
II. fig. 13). The half and the quarter of the cistophorus have on 
one side a bunch of grapes on a leaf or leaves of the vine, and 
the club with the lion's skin of Heracles within an ivy-wreath. 
They were tetradrachms equal in weight to about three Attic- 
drachms or three denarii. These coins became abundant when 
the kingdom of Pergamum was transformed into the province 
of Asia, and are struck at its chief cities, as Pergamum, Adra- 
myttium, the Lydian Stratoniceia, Thyatira, Sardis, Smyrna, 
Ephesus, Tralles, Nysa, Laodicea and Apamea. They have at 
first the names of Greek magistrates, afterwards coupled with 
those of Roman proconsuls or propraetors. The silver medallions 
of Asia, the successors of the cistophori, range from Mark Antony 
to Hadrian and Sabina. They bear no names of cities, but some 
may be attributed by their references to local forms of worship. 
The obverse bears an imperial head, the reverse a type either 
Greek or Roman. The art is the best of this age, more delicate 
in design and execution than that of any other pieces, the Roman 
medallions excepted. One of the most remarkable imperial bronze 
coins of Pergamum represents the Great Altar (PL II. fig. 16). 

The coinage of the Troad is interesting from its traditional 
allusions to the Trojan War. Of Abydos there is a fine gold 
Troas, stater, with the unusual subject of Victory sacrificing 
a ram, and the eagle, which is the most constant type 
of the silver money. One of the few imperial coins commemo- 
rates the legend of Hero and Leander. The late tetradrachms 
of Alexandria Troas bear the head of Apollo Smintheus, and 
on the reverse his figure armed with a bow. There is a long 
series of the town as a colonia, of extremely poor work. Ilium 
Novum strikes late Attic tetradiachms with a head of Athene, 
and on the reverse the same goddess carrying spear and distaff, 
with the inscription A0HNAS IAIAAOS. On the autonomous 
and imperial bronze we notice incidents of the tale of Troy, 
as Hector in his cat, or slaying Patroclus, or fighting; and again 
the flight of Aeneas. The island of Tenedos is represented by 
very early coins, and others of the fine and late periods. The 
usual obverse type of all the silver pieces is a Janus-like com- 
bination of two heads, presumably some primitive god and his 
consort; this double type is balanced on the reverse by the 
double-axe,- which played an important part in the primitive 
cults of Asia Minor and the Aegaean. 

In Aeolis the most noteworthy coins are the late tetradrachms 
of Cyme and Myrina, both of the time of decline, yet with a 
certain strength which relieves them from the general weakness 
of the work of that age. Cyme has the head of the Amazon 
Cyme, and a horse within a laurel-wreath; Myrina, a head of 
the Grynean Apollo and his figure with lustral branch and patera. 

Lesbos is remarkable for having coined in base as well as pure 
silver, its early billon coins being peculiar to the island. This 
base coinage, which was probably common to Mytilene and 
Methymna, ceases about 450 B.C., when the Mytilenaean silver 
begins. Methymna has very interesting archaic silver coins, 
with the boar and the head of Athene. But the most important 
coinage of Lesbos is the beautiful electrum coinage (a unique 
stater, PL II. fig. 14, and innumerable sixths) which was issued from 
about 480 to 350. Phocaea in Ionia issued similar coins, dis- 
tinguished by a seal (the badge of the city), and a convention 
regulating the weight and quality of the two coinages, and 
arranging for the two mints to work in alternate years, is still 
extant. The types vary accordingly, as at Cyzicus and Lamp- 
sacus. There is a iong and important series of Mytilene of 
the imperial time, including very interesting commemorative 
coins, some of persons of remote history, as Pittacus and Sappho, 
others of benefactors of the city, as Theophanes the friend of 
Pompey, from whom he obtained for this his native place the 
privileges of a free city. The usual style for these persons is 
hero or heroine, but Theophanes is called a god, and Archedamis, 
probably his wife, a goddess. 

The money of Ionia is abundant and beautiful. For the first 
century and a half (c. 700-545) the chief coinage is of electrum. 
To the 7th century belongs the remarkable coin in- 1nntM 
scribed *AENOS EMI 2HMA (" I am the badge of the 
Bright One " or " of Phanes "), with a stag, which was perhaps 
issued at Ephesus. From 545 to the Ionic revolt (494) there 
is considerable diminution in the coinage; silver attains more 
importance. Thenceforward, the course of the coinage is fairly 
uniform until the period 301-190, when there is a general cessa- 
tion of autonomous issues. After the battle of Magnesia there 
is a great revival, tetradrachms of Alexandrine and also of local 
types being issued in vast numbers. After the constitution of 
the Roman province of Asia (133), the cistophori supply the 
silver coinage. The imperial bronze coinage is numerous, with 
many interesting local types. Of the coins of the various cities 
the following demand mention. At Clazomcnae in the 4th 
century there are splendid coins, having for types the head of 
Apollo, three-quarter face, and a swan. The chief pieces, the 
gold drachm and a half or octobol, and the silver stater or 
tetradrachm present two types of the head of Apollo, very 
grand on the gold and the silver, with the signature of Theodotus, 
the only known Asiatic engraver, and richly beautiful on the 
other silver piece. These coins are marked by the intense 
expression of the school of western Asia Minor. Colophon has 
fine severe coins of the 5th century with the head of Apollo and 
the lyre. 

The money of Ephesus is historically interesting, but very 
disappointing in its art, which is limited by the small range of 
subjects and their lack of beauty. The leading type Ephesus. 
is the bee; later the stag and the head of Artemis 
appear. Thus the subjects relate to the worship of the famous 
shrine. The oldest coins are electrum and silver, both on the 
Phoenician standard. The type is a bee and the reverse is 
incuse. The silver coinage continues with the same types, 
unbroken by the Persian dominion, until in 394 B.C. a remarkable 
new coin appears. When Conon and Pharnabazus defeated 
the Lacedaemonian fleet and liberated the Greek cities of Asia 
from Spartan tryanny a federal coinage was issued by Rhodes, 
Cnidus, Samos, Ephesus, Iasus and Byzantium with their 
proper types on the reverse, but on the obverse the infant 
Heracles strangling two serpents; these are Rhodian tridrachms. 
About this time the Rhodian standard was introduced, and a 
series of tetradrachms began with the bee, having for reverse 
the forepart of a stag looking back, and behind him a date- 
palm. The head of Artemis as a Greek goddess begins to appear 
in the 3rd century. Other series of coins follow with types 
associated with Artemis, Rhodian and Attic standards alternat- 
ing; there are also Alexandrine tetradrachms and of course 
cistophori. The connexion of the city with Lysimachus, who 
called it Arsinoe, after his wife, is commemorated by coins 
inscribed APSI. The Ephesian form of Artemis, as the cultus 
figure of a nature-goddess, first appears as a symbol on the 
cistophori, and then on gold coins struck during the revolt of 
87-84, when Ephesus took the side of Mithradates. The imperial 
money provides many representations of the temples of the city, 
including that of the famous shrine of Artemis, which shows 
the bands of sculpture on the columns, as well as many other 
remarkable subjects, particularly the Zeus of rain seated on 
Mount Pelion, a shower falling from his left hand, while below 
arc seen the temple of Artemis and the river-god Cayster; on 
another coin the strange Asiatic figure of the goddess, frequent 
in this series, stands between the personified rivers Cayster and 
Cenchrius. The money of the Ionian Magnesia begins with the 
issue of Themistocles, when he was dynast under Persian pro- 
tection. The ordinary silver coins (350-190 B.C.) representing 
a cavalryman and the river-god Maeander as a bull are common. 
After 190 B.C. we have spread tetradrachms of the dedine of 
art, more delicately executed than those of Cyme and Myrina, 
with a bust of Artemis and a figure of Apollo standing on a 
maeander and leaning against a lofty tripod, the whole in a 
Miktus. laurel-wreath. The great city of Miletus is disappoint- 
ing in its money. The period of its highest prosperity 
is too early for an abundant coinage, yet in the oldest electrum 
issues we see the lion and the sun of Apollo Didymeus. In the 
early 4th century the Carian dynasts issued coins from Ephesus. 
To about 350 B.C. belong the beautiful coins bearing the head 
of Apollo facing and the lion looking back at a sun, with the 
inscription ET AIAYMflN IEPH (scil. $paxvn)j showing that 
this was the " sacred " money of the famous temple at Didyma. 
The types of the head of Apollo in profile and the lion with the 
sun continue through a series of various standards with very 
rare Attic gold staters of the early 2nd century. Phocaea is 
represented by two very interesting currencies; an electrum 
series of hectae, characterized by a seal, the badge of the town, 
beneath the type, struck in convention with Mytilene (see 
above); and also a widespread early silver coinage, apparently 
common to the western colonies of the city. The autonomous 
money is wholly anterior to the Persian conquest. Smyrna 
Smyrna. i ssue d m tne 4 tn century a very rare coin with the 
head of Apollo and a lyre, of Colophonian style. 
Among the earliest coins of New Smyrna are some showing 
that Lysimachus named it Eurydicea after his daughter. After 
190 B.C. it strikes Attic tetradrachms, with the turreted head of 
Cybele or the city or the Amazon Smyrna (PL II. fig. 15), and an 
oak- wreath. sometimes enclosing a lion. A rare silver coin and 
common bronze coins present on the reverse the seated figure 
of Homer. A gold coin issued by the Prytaneis of the Smyr- 
naeans probably belongs to the time of the Mithradatic revolt 
against Rome (87-84). The imperial coins have numerous 
types, among others the two Nemeses appearing to Alexander 
in a vision. 

Of Teos there are early Aeginetic didrachms, bearing on the one 
side a seated griffin and on the other a quadripartite incuse square. 
Teos These ceased at the moment when the population left 

the town, destroyed by the Persians, and fled to Abdera, 
where we recognize their type on the coinage of the time. There 
are much later coins of less importance. 

Chios and Samos, islands of Ionia, are represented by interesting 
currencies. Chios struck electrum and abundant silver. The type 
Chios. was a seate d sphinx with curled wing, and before it stands 

an amphora, above which is a bunch of grapes; the reverse 
has a quadripartite incuse. The coins begin before the Persian 
conquest (490 B.C.). 

The coinage of Samos is artistically disappointing, but as a whole 
has many claims to interest. The earliest money included electrum. 
Samos. The silver begins before 494 B.C. The types are the well- 
known lion's scalp and bull's head. The Athenian con- 
quest (439 B.C.) is marked by the introduction of the olive-spray as a 
constant symbol on the reverse and the occasional occurrence of Attic 
weight. The Samians, having joined the anti-Laconian alliance 
after Conon's victory in 394 B.C., struck the coin with Heracles 
strangling the serpents already noticed under Ephesus; the Rhodian 
weight is here introduced. The long series of imperial money is not 
without interesting types. The most remarkable is the figure of the 
Samian Hera, which clearly associates her with the group of divinities 
to which the Ephesian Artemis belongs. Very noticeable also are the 
representations of Pythagoras, seated or standing, touching a globe 
with a wand. 

The money of Caria does not present any one great series. 
Autonomous silver coins are not numerous except at Cnidus, 
Carta. anc * rar ely of good style. Antiochia and Alabanda 
have tetradrachms in the 2nd century. The imperial 
coins of Antiochia and of Aphrodisias are worthy of notice. 
Cnidus is represented at first by archaic coins of Aeginetic 
weight, some as early as the first half of the 7th century, with a 
very rude head of Aphrodite. The head of the famous statue of 
Aphrodite by Praxiteles is not reproduced, but the whole 
statue figures on imperial coins. Among the imperial types of 
Halicarnassus the head of Herodotus is noteworthy. There is 
late silver money of Iasus with the head of Apollo, and a youth 
swimming beside a dolphin around which his arm is thrown. 
Idyma has silver pieces of fine style on which the head of Apollo 
is absolutely facing; the reverse type is a fig-leaf . On imperial 
coins of Mylasa the figure of the Zeus of Labranda holding double- 
axe and spear is represented. Of Termera we have the rare 
coin of its tyrant Tymnes, dating about the middle of the 5th 
century and struck on the Persic system. 

The Carian satraps prove their wealth by their series of silver 
coins, which bear the names of Hecatomnus, Mausolus, Hidrieus 
and Pixodarus. The weight is Rhodian; the types are the three- 
quarter face of Apollo, and Zeus Labrandeus standing, holding 
the labrys or two-headed axe. Pixodarus also strikes gold of 
Attic weight. His silver is the best in the series, and clearly 
shows the Ionian style in its quality of expression. 

Among the islands of Caria, Calymna begins in the 6th century 
or earlier with curious archaic Persian didrachms bearing a 
helmeted male head and on the reverse a lyre. The 
series of Cos begins with small archaic pieces, the Jad^o* 
type a crab and the reverse incuse. Next come fine 
coins of transitional style and Attic weight, with the types of a 
discobolus before a tripod, and a crab, The break so common 
in the coinage of this coast then interrupts the issue, and a new 
coinage occurs before the time of Alexander. The weight ns 
Rhodian, the types the head of Heracles and the crab. After 
Alexander there is another currency which ceases about 200 B.C. 
It is resumed later with the new types of the head of Asclepius 
and his serpent. This continues in Roman times. The bronze 
of that age comprises a coin with the head of Hippocrates and 
on the reverse the staff of Asclepius. Xenophon's head likewise 
occurs, and the portrait of Nicias tyrant in Cos (c. 50 B.C.) on 
his bronze. Imperial money ends the series. 

The island of Rhodes, great in commerce and art, has a rich 
series of coins. The want of variety in the types — at the city of 
Rhodes almost limited to the head of Helios and the Rhodes. 
rose — is disappointing, but happily the principal 
subject could not fail to illustrate the movements of art, one of 
which had here its centre. The city of Rhodes was founded 
c. 408 B.C. on the abandonment by their inhabitants of the three 
chief towns of the island, Camirus, Ialysus and Lindus. The 
money of Camirus seems to begin in the 6th century B.C. The 
type is the fig-leaf, the weight Aeginetic, later degraded. The 
coins of Ialysus, of the 5th century, follow the Phoenician 
standard. Their types are the forepart of a winged boar and an 
eagle's head. The money of Lindus, apparently before 480 B.C., 
is of Phoenician weight, with the type of a lion's head. The 
people of the new city of Rhodes adopted another standard, the 
Attic, and very shortly abandoned it, except for gold money, 
using instead that peculiar weight which has been called Rhodian; 
this they retained until the last years of their independent 
coinage, when they resumed the Attic. The types are the three- 
quarter face of Helios and the rose. There is a grandeur and 
noble outlook in the earlier heads of Helios which well befits 
his character, but the pictorial style is evident in the form of 
the hair and the expression, which, with all its reserve, has a 
dramatic quality (see PI. II. fig. 17). Towards the end of the 
4th century the radiate head is introduced; the Alexandrine 
tetradrachms, which were issued after the battle of Magnesia, 
find a place in the Rhodian mintage. During the age after 
Alexander there is an abundant bronze coinage, with some 
pieces of unusual size. The series closes with a few imperial 
coins ranging from Nerva to Marcus Aurelius. 

The early coinage of Lycia introduces us at once into a region 
of Asiatic mythology, art and language, raising many questions 
as yet without an answer. The standard of the oldest tycia. 
coins (beginning about 520 B.C.) is low Persic, and it 
falls perhaps under Athenian influence, until it is often indis- 
tinguishable from the Attic. The Lycian character belongs to 
the primitive alphabets of Asia Minor, which combine with 
archaic Greek forms others which are unknown to the Greek 
alphabet, and it expresses a native language as yet but imper- 
fectly understood. The art is stiff and delights in animal forms, 
sometimes of monstrous types, which recall the designs of 
Phoenicia and Assyria. The most remarkable symbol is the 
triskeles or tetraskeles symbol, an object resembling a ring, to 

► which three or four hooks are attached. It is supposed to be a 
solar symbol like the swastika. The oldest money has a boar or 
his fore-part and an incuse. This is succeeded by a series with 
an animal reverse, and then by one in which the hooked ring is 
the usual reverse type. The fourth series bears Lycian in- 
scriptions, which give the names of dynasts and places. A fifth 
series is characterized by the type of a lion's scalp. This coinage 
reaches as late as Alexander's time. It is followed by silver and 
bronze money of the Lycian League before Augustus and under 
his reign, but ceasing in that of Claudius — the usual types of the 
chief silver piece, a hemidrachm, being the head of Apollo and 
the lyre. The districts of Cragus and Masicytus have coinages, 
as well as the individual cities. Besides this general currency 
there are some special ones of towns not in the League. The 
imperial money rarely goes beyond the reign of Augustus, and 
is resumed during that of Gordian III. There is a remarkable 
coin of Myra of this emperor, showing the goddess of the city, 
of a type like the Ephesian Artemis, in a tree; two woodcutters, 
each armed with a double axe, hew at the trunk, from which 
two serpents rise as if to protect it and aid the goddess. Phaselis 
is an exceptional town, for it has early Greek coins, the leading 
type being a galley. 

The coinage of Pamphylia offers some examples of good art 
distinctly marked by the Asiatic formality. Aspendus shows a 
remarkable series of Persic didrachms, extending from 
about 500 B.C. to Alexander's time. The oldest coins 
have the types of a warrior and the triskelion or three 
legs, more familiarly associated with Sicily; it is probably a 
solar symbol. These coins are followed by a long series with the 
types of two wrestlers engaged and a slinger. The main legend is 
almost always in the Panphylian character and language. There 
are also very curious imperial types. The money of Perga begins 
in the 2nd century with Greek types of the Artemis of Perga. 
Her figure in a remarkable Asiatic form occurs in the long impe- 
rial series. Bronze coins earlier in date than the silver money 
with the Greek types have the Pamphylian title of the goddess, 
FANA2SA2 IIPEIIA2, "of the Lady of Perga." Side has 
at first Persic didrachms of about 480 B.C., their types the pome- 
granate and dolphin and head of Athene; then there are money 
with an undeciphered Aramaizing inscription of the 4th century 
and figures of Athene and Apollo, and late Attic tetradrachms, 
their types being the head of Athene and Victory. These were 
carried on by Amyntas, king of Galatia, when he made his mint 
in Side (36 B.C.). The pomegranate (cidrj) is throughout the 
badge of the city. 

The money of Pisidia is chiefly imperial. There is a long 
series of this class of the colonia Antiochia. The autonomous 
coins of Selge have the wrestlers and the slinger of 
Ws/dfc, Aspendus in inferior and even barbarous copies. Of 
Isauria and Lycaonia a few cities, including Derbe 
and the colonies of Iconium and Lystra, strike coins, chiefly of 
imperial time. 

Cilicia, for the most part a coastland, is numismatically of 
high interest. To Aphrodisias is assigned an interesting series 
of archaic coins with a winged figure and a pyramidal 
fetish-stone; in the 4th century Aphrodite is repre- 
sented in human form seated between sphinxes; the Parthenos 
of Pheidias is also represented. Celenderis has a coinage 
beginning in the 5th century, with a horseman seated sideways 
on the obverse, and on the reverse a goat kneeling on one knee. 
Mallus has a most interesting series of silver coins, some with 
curious Asiatic types. Of Nagidus there are Persic didrachms 
of good style, one interesting type being Aphrodite seated, 
before whom Eros flies crowning her, with, on the other side, a 
standing Dionysus. Soli has silver coins of the same weight, 
the types being an archer or the head of Athene, one variety 
imitated from remote Velia, and a bunch of grapes. The coinage 
of Tarsus begins in the 5th century with Persic staters repre- 
senting a Cilician king on horseback, and a hoplite kneeling. 

In the 4th century it was the mint of a large series of satrapal 
coins, issued by Pharnabazus, Mazaeus and other governors 
(Issus, Mallus and Soli also sharing the cost of minting). The 
chief type is the Baal of Tarsus. The autonomous bronze of the 
Seleucid age shows the remarkable subject of the pyre of Sandan, 
the local form of Heracles; and there is a long and curious 
imperial series. The coinage of Anazarbus (imperial, showing 
rivalry with Tarsus), Seleucia on the Calycadnus, Mopsus, and 
the priest-kings of Olba are also full of interest. 

The coinage of the great island of Cyprus is, as we might expect 
from its monuments, almost exclusively non-Hellenic in character. 
The weight-system, except of gold, which is Attic, is 
Persic, save only in the later coins of some mints, struck W»*- 
on the reduced Khodian standard, and a solitary Attic tetradrachm 
of Paphos. The art is usually very stiff down to about 400 B.C., with 
types of Egypto-Phoenician or Phoenician or of Greek origin. The 
inscriptions are in the Cyprian syllabic character and the earliest 
coins resemble the early Etruscan in being one-sided. The prevalent 
types are animals or their heads, the chief subjects being the bull, 
eagle, sheep, lion, the lion seizing the stag, the deer and the mythical 
sphinx. The divinities we can recognize are Aphrodite, Heracles, 
Athene, Hermes and Zeus Ammon. But the most curious mytho- 
logical types are a goddess carried by a bull or by a ram, in both cases 
probably Astarte, the Phoenician Aphrodite. The most remarkable 
symbol is the well-known Egyptian sign of life. The coins appear to 
have been struck by kings until before the age of Alexander, when 
civic money appears. The mints to which coins are ascribed with 
certainty are Salamis, Paphos, Marium, Idalium and Citium. The 
coins of the Salaminian line are in silver and gold. The earlier, 
beginning with Evelthon about 560 B.C., have Cyprian, the later 
Greek inscriptions, the types generally being native, though after a 
time under Hellenic influence. They are of Evagoras I., Nicocles, 
Evagoras II., Pnytagoras and Nicocreon, and the coinage is closed 
by Menelaus, brother of Ptolemy I. The Phoenician kings of Citium, 
from about 500 to 312, strike silver and in one case gold, their general 
types being Heracles and the Hon seizing the stag. Bronze begins 
soon after 400 B.C., and of the same age there are autonomous pieces 
in silver and bronze. There is Greek imperial money from Augustus 
to Caracalla (chiefly issued by the Kot^). The most remarkable 
type is the temple at Paphos, represented as a structure of two storeys 
with wings. \Vithin the central portion is the sacred stone, in front a 
semicircular court. 

The earliest coinage of Lydia is no doubt that of the kings, already 
described. The next currency must have been of Persian darics 
(gold) and drachms (silver), followed by that of Alexander, 
the Seleucids, and the Attalids of Pergamum, and then by ^yois, 
the cistophori of the province of Asia. There is an abundant bronze 
coinage of the cities, autonomous from the formation of the province, 
and of imperial time, but mostly of the imperial class. The largest 
currencies are of Philadelphia, Sardis, Thyatira and Tralles. The art 
is not remarkable, though good for the period, and the types are 
mostly Greek. 

The coinage of Phrygia has the same general characteristics as 
that of Lydia, but the workmanship is poorer. ^ Among noteworthy 
types must be noticed Men or Lunus,' the Phrygian moon- purvvim 
god. There are curious types of Apamea, surnamed °^ * 

Kibotos or the Ark, and more anciently Celaenae. One of Severus 
represents the legend of the invention of the double pipe, a type 
already described. Of the same and later emperors are coins bearing 
the famous type of the ark of Noah and the name NHE. The town 
of Cibyra is remarkable for a silver coinage of the 1st century B.C., 
of which the large pieces have the weight of cistophori. 

Galatia has little to offer of interest. Trajan issued bronze 
imperial coins for the province, and there is imperial money of Ancyra, 
Pcssinus and Tavium. The. only remarkable regal issue Q*ia*i* 
is that of Amyntas, Strabo's contemporary, who struck 
tetradrachms at Side in Pamphylia. 

With the coinage of Cappadocia we bid farewell to Greek art and 
enter on the domain of Oriental conventionalism, succeeded by 
inferior Roman design coarsely executed. There is one Ca Ppam 
large imperial series, that of Caesarea, intended for general a J™^ tf& - 
circulation in the province. The issues range from ' 

Tiberius to Gordian 111., and arc in silver and bronze. The most 
common type is the sacred Mount Argaeus, on which a statue is 
sometimes seen — a remarkable type curiously varied. There are 
scanty issues of a few other towns. There is an interesting series of 
coins of the kings of Cappadocia, beginning with Ariarathes 1. (c. 332- 
322 B.C.), who struck Persic drachms at Sinope and Gaziura, and 
continuing with other kings, called usually Ariarathes or Ariobar- 
zanes, who struck Attic drachms and occasionally tetradrachms. 
The rare tetradrachms of Orophernes, a successful usurper (i§8— 
157 B.C.), bear a fine portrait. The coins of Archelaus, the last king 
set up by Antony (36 b.c.-a.d. 17), have a good head on the obverse. 
Of Armenia there are a few silver and bronze coins of late sovereigns. 

The great series of Syrian money begins with the coinage 
of the Seleucid kings of Syria, only rivalled for length and 
abundance by that of the Ptolemies, which it excels in its 
Series of portraits, though it is far inferior in its gold money 
s ria an< * wants ^ e l ar S e anc * well-executed bronze pieces 

which make the Egyptian currency complete. The gold 
of the Seleucids is scarce, and their main coinage is a splendid 
series of tetradrachms bearing the portraits of the successive 
sovereigns. The reverse types are varied for the class of regal 
money. The execution of the portraits is good, and forms the 
best continuous history of portraiture for the third and second 
centuries before our era. The reverses are far less careful. 
The weight is Attic, but the cities of Phoenicia were ultimately 
allowed to strike on their own standard. Many of the coins of 
the earlier kings wereissuedin their Bactrian or Indian dominions. 
Seleucus I. (312-280 B.C.) began by striking gold staters and 
tetradrachms with the types of Alexander the Great. The same 
king, like his contemporaries, then took his own types: for 
gold staters, his head with a bull's horn, and on the reverse a 
horse's head with bull's horns; for tetradrachms, his own head 
in a helmet of hide with bull's horn and lion's skin, and Victory 
crowning a trophy, or the head of Zeus, and Athene fighting 
in a car drawn by four or two elephants with bull's horns. 
Antiochus I. (293-261), like his father, first struck tetradrachms 
with Alexandrine types, and then with his own head, Apollo 
on the omphalos occupying the reverse. The portrait of Antiochus 
has a characteristic realism. Antiochus III. (222-187) is repre- 
sented by a fine and interesting series with a vigorous portrait. 
He alone of the Seleucids seems to have struck the great octa- 
drachm in gold in rivalry of the Ptolemies. Coins dated by 
the Seleucid era (312 B.C.) first appear in his reign. The portrait 
of Antiochus IV. Epiphanes (175-164) is extremely character- 
istic, marked by the mad obstinacy which is the key to the 
tyrant's history. The most remarkable coin is a tetradrachm 
with the head of Antiochus in the character of Zeus. In his 
time mints became numerous in the bronze coinage, and there is a 
remarkable series in that metal with Ptolemaic types, marking his 
short-lived usurpation in Egypt. From the time of Demetrius I. 
(162-150) the silver tetradrachms bear both mints and dates. 
In one type the heads of Demetrius and Queen Laodice occur 
side by side. With Alexander I. Balas (152-144), Tyre and 
Sidon begin to strike royal tetradrachms on their own Phoenician 
weight. Tarsus also first strikes coins for him with the type of 
the pyre of Sandan. The money of young Antiochus VI. pre- 
sents the most carefully executed portrait in the whole series, 
which, despite its weakness, has a certain charm of sweetness 
that marks it as a new type in art. The same artist's hand seems 
apparent in the fine portrait of the cruel usurper Tryphon, and 
also in the picturesque spiked Macedonian helmet with a goat's 
horn and cheek-piece which occupies the reverse. Antiochus VII. 
(138-129) continues the series with, amongst other coins, 
the solitary bronze piece cf Jerusalem, bearing the lily and the 
Seleucid anchor. Alexander II. Zebina (1 28-1 23) is represented by 
a unique gold coin (PL II. fig. 18), as well as by silver and bronze. 
The empire closes with the money of the Armenian Tigranes 
(83-69), bearing his portrait with the lofty native tiara, and for 
reverse Antioch seated, the Orontes swimming at her feet (a 
copy of the famous group by Eutychides). 

There is a copper coinage of the Syrian koinon under Trajan; 
also of the cities of Commagene, Samosata and Zeugma, 
Comma* an( j j ess important mints. The money of the kings of 
& ne * Commagene is in bronze (c. 140 B.C. to A.D. 72). 

Cyrrhestica has bronze coins of a few cities, nearly all imperial, 
Cyrrhes- tne chief mints being Cyrrhus and Hieropolis. Hieropolis 
t fa ' in the time of Alexander the Great issued some remark- 
able silver coins in the name of Abd-Hadad and Alexander 
himself, with figures of the Syrian goddess Atergatis, who also 
appears on its imperial coins. 

Of Chalcidcne there are bronze coins of Chalcis and of the tetrarchs, 
Chakl- anf * Palmyrene shows, only the small bronze pieces of 
dene, <Sc Palmyra, the money of Zenobia and the family of 
Odenathus being found in the series of Alexandria. 
m In Seleucis and Pieria, the four cities of Antioch, Apamea, Lao- 
dicea ad Mare and Seleucia Pieria issued a joint coinage inscribed 
Antioch. AAEA * ftN AHMfiN about the middle of the 2nd 
loco, century B#c# gut the bulk of the money of this territory 
is of the great city of Antioch on the Orontes. The coinage is both 
autonomous bronze before-and of Roman times, and imperial silver, 
base metal and bronze. Other mints (as Tyre and Sidon) in this same 
province issued silver of the same class as Antioch, with different 
symbols. A large series of coins was issued bearing on the reverse the 
letters S.C. (Senatus consulto), showing that the coinage was under 
the control of the Roman senate. Both Latin and Greek inscriptions 
are used until the reign of Trajan. ^ The city is first called a colony on 
the coins of Elagabalus. The earliest coins are dated by various eras 
(Seleucid, Caesarian, Actian); later the emperor's consulships are 
used to date the silver. The leading types are the figure of Antioch 
seated, the river Orontes swimming at her feet, from the famous 
statue by Eutychides, and the eagle on a thunderbolt, a palm in 
front. Under Hadrian the eagle is represented carrying an ox*s leg, 
a reference to the story of the foundation of the city when an eagle 
carried off part of the sacrifice and deposited it on the site which was 
consequently chosen. There are xew other types. The series 
(which, strictly speaking, was not the local coinage of Antioch, but 
an imperial coinage for the province) is very full and includes money 
of the Syrian emperor Sulpicius Uranius Antoninus (who also struck 
bronze at Emesa and gold of the Roman imperial class). It ends with 
Valerian, though it begins anew in the Roman provincial money of the 
reform of Diocletian, to be noticed later. 

Of the other cities of this district, Emisa presents the type of the 
sacred stone of Elagabal. The imperial money of Gabala shows the 
veiled cultus-statue of a goddess flanked by sphinxes. 
Laodicea has an important series. It begins with bronze ££ smeSf 
money of the later Seleucids. The autonomous tetra- 
drachms of the 1st century B.C. have a turreted and veiled female 
bust of the city, a favourite Syrian and Phoenician type. From 
47 B.C. its title is Julia Laodicea ; from Caracalla downwards it is a 
colonia; the inscriptions become Latin; then, very strangely, 
Greek on the obverse of the coins and Latin on the reverse. Seleucia 
has a similar regpl autonomous and imperial currency, but does not 
become a colonia. A shrine containing the sacred stone of Zeus 
Casius, and the thunderbolt of Zeus Keraunius resting on a throne, 
are among the types. 

In Coele-Syria, Damascus issues coins from the 3rd century B.C. 
(beginning with Alexandrine tetradrachms) onwards; the city 
becomes a colonia under Philip I. The imperial money of _ , 
Heliopolis (Baalbek), a colonia, shows a great temple (of cy^" & Ct 
the Zeus of Heliopolis) in perspective, another temple 
containing an ear of corn as the central object of woiship, and 
a view of the Acropolis with the great temple upon it, and steps 
leading up the rock. 

The coinage of Phoenicia is a large and highly interesting series. 
The autonomous money is here important, and indicates the 
ancient wealth of the great marts of the coast. The Pboeaic f at 
earliest coins were struck about the middle of the 
5th century and usually bear Phoenician inscriptions. The 
coinage falls into three main periods; the first pre-Alexandrine; 
the second, that of Alexandrine, Ptolemaic and Seleucid rule; 
the third, that of the empire. In the first period Aradus strikes 
silver, usually on the Babylonian standard, staters with a head 
of Melkarth and a galley, and smaller denominations. All 
the other cities use the Phoenician standard. The regal silver 
coins of Byblus have a galley as obverse type; on the reverse, 
a vulture standing on a ram, or a Hon devouring a bull. Here 
and at Sidon and Tyre portions of the types are represented 
incuse. Sidon has a large and important series of silver octa- 
drachms and smaller denominations; on the obverse is a galley 
(at first with sails set, then without sails, first lying before a 
fortress, afterwards alone). On the reverse is the king of Persia 
in a chariot, or slaying a lion. These coins were issued by the 
kings such as Strato I. and II. and Tennes, and by the satrap 
Mazaeus. The early silver of Tyre has as reverse type an owl 
with a crook and flail over its shoulder; on the obverse a dolphin, 
or Melkarth riding on a sea-horse; a common symbol is the 
purple-shell (PL II. fig. 20). In the second period, besides Alexan- 
drine silver and regal coins of the Ptolemies and Seleucidae, 
there are certain large and important issues of autonomous or 
semi-autonomous silver tetradrachms and smaller denominations, 
as at Aradus (head of the City, and Victory; also drachms 
with types copied from Ephesus: obv., bee, rev., stag and date- 
palm), Marathus (head of the City, and nude figure at Marathus 
seated on a pile of shields), Sidon (head of the City, and eagle), 
Tripolis (busts of the Dioscuri, and figure of the City holding 
cornucopiae) and Tyre (head of the Tyrian Heracles, Melkarth, 
and eagle). Tyre also issued a gold decadrachm with the head 
of the City, and a double cornucopiae. On these and other 
coins Sidon and Tyre claim the rights of asylum, Berytus first 
coins in this period, sometimes under the name of Laodicea in 
Canaan. Ace-Ptolemais (Acre) was an important mint under 
the Ptolemies; for a time, under the Seleucidae, it was called 
Antiochia in Ptolemais. Besides the Seleucid era autonomous 
eras are in use at some of the cities, as at Aradus (259 B.C.), 
Sidon (111 B.C.) and Tyre (126 B.C.). Under the empire there 
are some very large coinages of bronze, besides a certain amount 
of silver resembling that of Antioch. The quasi-autonomous 
silver of Tyre was also issued as late as a.d. 57. Berytus (a 
colonia) has types relating to the cults of Astarte and Poseidon; 
Astarte is also prominent at Sidon (a colonia from Elagabalus 
onwards; a common type represents the wheeled shrine of 
the goddess) and Tripolis. At Byblus a temple is represented 
with a conical fetish. Tyre has many interesting types: Dido 
building Carthage; the Ambrosial Rocks; Cadmus fighting 
the serpent or founding Thebes, &c. Ptolemais issued coins 
as a colony from Claudius onwards. 

In Trachonitis, the only city of importance is Caesarea Panias, 
with a famous grotto of Pan, perhaps represented on an imperial 
coin. Several cities in Decapolis issued imperial coins, 
among them Gadara and Gerasa. In Galilee the coins 
struck at Tiberias by its founder, Herod Antipas, may be 
mentioned. Samaria has money of Caesarea, botb autonomous 
and imperial, the last for the most part colonial, and also imperial 
of Neapolis, among the types of which occurs the interesting 
subject of Mount Gerizim surmounted by the Samaritan temple. 
The coinage of Judaea is an interesting series. The money of 
Jerusalem is of high interest, and more extensive than appears 
at first sight. Here was struck the coin of Antiochus VII., 
witb the native lily as a type, tbe series of the Maccabaean 
princes, tbat of the Roman procurators, and the bronze coins 
countermarked by the tenth legion, quartered by Titus in the 
ruins of the city. One of these bears the remarkable symbol 
of a pig. After the reduction of Judaea in the reign of Hadrian, 
Jerusalem was rebuilt as a colonia witb the name Aelia Capitolina. 
Tbe earliest coin commemorates the foundation. The coinage 
lasts as late as Valerian. Ascalon strikes autonomous silver and 
bronze, including remarkable tetradrachms with tbe portraits 
of Ptolemy Auletes, of his elder son Ptolemy XIV., and of his 
daughter Cleopatra (see PI. II. fig. 21). There is also money of 
Gaza of some importance; the earliest coins are Attic drachms, 
&c, of barbarous style, inspired by Greek, especially Athenian 
models; on its imperial coins the god Marna, and Minos and 
Io are named. 

The independent Jewish coinage begins with the famous 
shekels. They have been assigned to various periods, but the 

preponderance of evidence would class them to Simon 
cohlage. Maccabaeus, to whom the right of coining was granted 

by Antiochus VII. The series is of shekels and half- 
shekels, of the weight of Phoenician tetradrachms and di- 
drachms. The obverse of the shekel bears the inscription " the 
shekel of Israel," and for type a sacred vessel of the temple, 
above which (after year 1) is the letter indicating the year of 
issue and the initial of the word year. The reverse reads " Jeru- 
salem the Holy," and the type is a flowering branch (PI. II. fig. 19). 
The half-shekel differs in having the inscription " half-shekel " 
on the obverse. The types are markedly peculiar; the obverse 
inscription is equally so, for the regular formula of the neigh- 
bouring cities would give nothing but the name of the city; 
but the reverse inscription is like that of Tyre and Sidon, for 
instance, " of Tyre sacred and inviolable." This agreement is 
confirmatory of the assignment to Simon Maccabaeus. This 
coinage bears the dates of years 1, 2, 3, 4 (rare), and 5 (very 
rare). There has been much discussion as to the date. It is 
best reckoned from the decree of Antiochus VII. granting the 
right of coinage to Simon (139-138 B.C.). The coins of the fifth 
year were then struck by John Hyrcanus. The certain coins 
of the successors of Simon are small bronze pieces of John 
Hyrcanus (135-104), of Judas Aristobulus (104-103), of Alexander 
Jannaeus (103-76), who strikes bilingual Hebrew and Greek 
and also Hebrew coins, showing his native name to have been 
Jonathan, and of Antigonus (40-37), who has the Hebrew name 
Mattathiah. The types represent only inanimate objects. The 
Maccabaean coinage is followed by that of the Herodian family, 
equally of bronze, the two most important issues being thoseof 
Herod the Great and Agrippa II. The silver coinage under the 
early empire was chiefly supplied by the issues of Antioch and 
Roman denarii; the " penny " with Caesar's image and super- 
scription was such a denarius. The money of the procurators 
of Judaea, in part parallel with tbe Herodian, is of small bronze 
coins, struck between a.d. 6^7 and a.d. 58-59, the latest period 
of their administration being as yet unrepresented. These are 
followed by two classes, the money of the first revolt (a.d. 
66-70) and that of the second (suppressed a.d. 155). Both risings 
caused the issue of native coinage, some of which may be assigned 
with certainty to each. Of the first revolt are bronze pieces of 
years 2, 3 and 4. Of the second revolt are restruck Antiochene 
tetradrachms and Roman denarii, usually with the name of 
Simon, which appears to have been that of the leader surnamed 
Bar Cochebas. The obverse type of the tetradrachms or shekels 
is the portico of the temple; on the reverse are a bundle of 
branches and a citron, symbols of the feast of tabernacles. 
Besides this native currency there are coins struck in Palestine 
by Vespasian, Titus and Domitian. 

Of Roman Arabia there are bronze imperial coins of Bostra and 
less important mints; the kings of Nabataea also issued silver and 
bronze coins from Aretas III. (c. 87-62 B.C.) to Rabbel II. 
(a.d. 75-101). From S. Arabia comes a remarkable silver Arabla * 
coinage issued by the Himyarites, beginning in the 4th iWcso " 
century B.C., and imitated originally from Attic tetra- P ot * ml *' 
drachms (both of the old and new style). In Mesopotamia Babylonia. 
the colonia of Carrhae deserves notice, and the city of Edessa, 
which issues imperial money as a colonia, and has a series of coins 
of its kings, striking with Roman emperors in silver and bronze. 
Curiously, this and the colonial issue are longcontemporary. The 
colonial coinages of Nisibis and of Resaena, which became a colonia, 
close the group. Babylon was probably a mint of Alexander the 
Great and of many of the Seleucid kings, certainly of the usurpers 
Molon (222-220) and Timarchus (162 B.C.). 

Africa* 

The coins of Africa are far less numerous then those of the 
other two continents, as Greek, Phoenician and Roman civiliza- 
tion never penetrated beyond Egypt and the northern 
coast to the west. The series of Egypt is first in gyp * 

geographical order. As yet no coins have been here assigned of 
a date anterior to Alexander. The old Egyptians kept their 
gold, electrum and silver in rings, and weighed them to ascertain 
the value. During the Persian rule the Persian money must 
have been current, and the satrap Aryandes is said to have issued 
a coinage of silver under Darius I. With Alexander a regular 
Greek coinage must have begun,- and some of his coins are of 
Egyptian mints. A rare bronze coin was struck at Naucratis, 
probably during his lifetime. With Ptolemy I. the great Ptole- 
maic currency begins, which lasted for three centuries. The 
characteristics of this coinage are its splendid series of gold 
pieces and the size of the bronze money. The execution of the 
earlier heads is good; afterwards they become coarse and 
careless. At first the fine pieces were issued by the Phoenician, 
Cyprian and other foreign mints, the Egyptian work being 
usually inferior. While the Seleucids were still striking good 
coins, the Ptolemies allowed their money to fall into barbarism 
in Egypt and even in Cyprus. The obverse type is a royal head, 
that of Ptolemy I. being the ordinary silver type (see PI. II. fig. 
22), while that of Arsinoe II. was long but not uninterruptedly 
continued on the gold. The head of Zeus Ammon is most usual 
en the bronze coinage. A type once adopted was usually 
retained. Thus Ptolemy I., Arsinoe II., Ptolemy IV., Cleopatra 
I., have a kind of commemoration in the coinage on the analogy 
of the priesthoods established in honour of each royal pair. 
The almost universal type of reverse cf all metals is the Ptole- 
maic badge, the eagle on the thunderbolt, wbich, in spite of 
variety, is always heraldic. For art and iconography this series 
is far inferior to that of the Seleucids. The weight after the 
earlier part of the reign of Ptolemy I. (who experimented with 
the Attic and Rhodian standards) is Phoenician for gold and 
silver; the metrology of the bronze is obscure. The chief 
coins are octadrachms in gold and tetradrachms in silver, besides 
the abundant bronze money. Ptolemy I. appears to have 
issued his money while regent for Philip Arrhidaeus (323-318); 
it only differs in the royal name from that of Alexander. He then 
struck money for Alexander IV. (317-31 1) on the Attic standard 
with the head of Alexander the Great, with the horn of Ammon 
in the elephant's skin and Alexander's reverse. He soon adopted 
a new reverse, that of Athene Promachos. This money he con- 
tinued to strike after the young king's death until he himself 
(305) took the royal title, when he issued his own money, his 
portrait on the one side and the eagle and thunderbolt with bis 
name as king on the other. This type in silver, with the in- 
scription " Ptolemy the king," is thenceforward the regular 
currency. He also issued gold staters (reverse, Alexander the 
Great in an elephant-car). Ptolemy II.* (Philadelphus, 285- 
247), the richest of the family, continued his father's coinage. 
Philadelphus also began (after the death and deification of 
Arsinoe II., about 271 B.C.), the issue of the gold octadrachms 
with the busts of Ptolemy I. and Berenice I., Ptolemy II. and 
Arsinoe II., and certainly struck beautiful octadrachms in gold 
and decadrachms in silver of Arsinoe II., the gold being long 
afterwards continued. Philadelphus also began the great bronze 
issues of the system. Ptolemy III. (Euergetes I. c. 247-222) 
struck gold octadrachms with his own portrait, wearing a crown 
of rays. His queen Berenice II., striking in her own right as 
heiress of the Cyrenaica and also as consort, issued a showy 
currency with her portrait, both octadrachms and decadrachms 
like those of Arsinoe, and a coinage for the Cyrenaica of peculiar 
divisions. Under Ptolemy IV. (Philopator, 222-205) the gold 
octadrachms are continued with his portrait and that of Arsinoe 
III. Ptolemy V. (Epiphanes, 205-181) still strikes octadrachms 
with bis portrait and with that of Arsinoe, and begins the con- 
tinuous series of the tetradrachms of the three great cities of 
Cyprus. The coinage henceforward steadily degenerates in 
style and eventually also in metal. In the latest series, the 
money of the famous Cleopatra VII., it is interesting to note 
the Egyptian variety of her head, also occurring on Greek 
imperial money and on that of Ascalon. 

Under the Roman rule the imperial money of Alexandria, the 
coinage of the imperial province of Egypt, is the most remarkable 
in its class for its extent and the interest and variety of its 
types. It begins under Augustus and ends with the usurper or 
patriot Achilleus, called on his money Domitius Domitianus, 
overthrown by Diocletian (a.d. 297), thus lasting longer than 
Greek imperial money elsewhere. In the earlier period there are 
base silver coins continuing the base tetradrachms struck by 
Auletes, and bronze money of several sizes. Most of the coins 
are dated by the regnal years of the emperors, the letter L 
being used for "year." The types are very various, and may 
be broadly divided into Greek, Graeco-Roman and Graeco- 
Egyptian. The Graeco-Roman types have the closest analogy 
to those of Rome herself; the Graeco-Egyptian are of high 
interest as a special class illustrative of the latest phase of 
Egyptian mythology. These native types, at first uncommon, 
from the time of Domitian are of great frequency. The money 
of Trajan, Hadrian and Antoninus Pius is abundant and in- 
teresting. A coin of Antoninus, dated in his sixth year, records 
the beginning of a new Sothiac cycle of 1460 years, which 
happened in the emperor's second year (a.d. 139). The reverse 
type is a crested crane, the Egyptian bennu or phoenix, with a 
kind of radiate nimbus round its head, and the inscription 
AlftN. Under Claudius II. (Gothicus) and thenceforward there 
is but a single kind of coin of bronze washed with silver. In 
this series we note the money of Zenobia, and of her son 
Vabalathus. 

Coins bearing the names and local types of the nomes of Egypt 
were struck by a few emperors at the Alexandrian mint. Their 
metal is bronze, and they are of different sizes. 

Passing by the unimportant coinage of the Libyans, we reach 
the interesting series of the Cyrenaica, the only truly Greek 
currency of Africa. It begins under the line of Battus about the 
middle of the 7th century, and reaches to the Roman rule as 

far as the reign of Augustus. The coins were issued at Cyrene, 
Barca, Euesperides and smaller towns. The weight of the gold 
always, and of the silver until some date not long after 450 B.C., 
is Euboic; afterwards it is Phoenician. The ruling types are the 
silphium plant and its fruit, and the bead of Zeus Ammon, first 
bearded (PI. II. fig. 23) then beardless. The art is vigorous, and 
in the transitional and fine period has the best Greek qualities. 
It is clearly an outlying branch of the school of central Greece. 
The oldest coins are uninscribed, so that it cannot always be 
said at which mint they were struck. The money with the name 
of Cyrene comprises a fine series of gold Attic staters and silver 
tetradrachms. It was an important mint of the Ptolemies. 
Barca has a smaller coinage then Cyrene. It comprises a wonder- 
ful tetradrachm (Phoenician), with the head of Ammon bearded, 
boldly represented, absolutely full face, and three silphiums 
joined, between their heads an owl, a chameleon and a jerboa. 
The money of Euesperides is less important. 

Syrtica and Byzacena offer little of interest. Their coins are 
late bronze, first with Punic inscriptions, then in imperial times 
with Latin and Punic or Latin. Latin and Greek are used in the 
same coins at Leptis Minor in Byzacena. 

In Zeugitana the great currency of Carthage is the last repre- 
sentative of Greek money, for, despite its Orientalism, its origin is 
Hellenic, and of this origin it is at first not unworthy. Its 
range in time is from about 410 B.C., when the Cartha- c*****B** 
ginians invaded Sicily, to the fall of Carthage in 146 B.C. The 
earliest coins are Attic tetradrachms of the class usually called Siculo- 
Punic. These, and certain gold coins with similar types, were issued 
in Sicily down to about 310 B.C. The types owe much to the coinage 
of Sicilian cities, especially Syracuse; but they show also distinct 
Punic motives, such as a lion before a palm-tree, or a head of a Punic 
queen. The Punic inscriptions enable some to be attributed to mints 
such as Motya, Solus, Eryx; others name "Carthage," "the 
Camp,'* 4 * the Paymasters," many, inscribed Ziz, were issued from 
Panormus. The coinage from about 340 to 242 B.C., perhaps all 
issued at Carthage itself, is scanty; the types, head of Persephone 
and a horse, or horse and palm-tree, now come in, and prevail to the 
end of the independent coinage. The acquisition of the Spanish 
mines about 241 caused the issue of a large coinage, but the gold and 
silver soon degenerate into electrum and potin. The metrology of the 
various series (excepting the Siculo- Punic) is obscure, but the 
standard seems to be Phoenician. The late silver 12-drachm pieces 
and some of the bronzes are among the heaviest struck coins of the 
ancients. The art of the earlier coins is sometimes purely Greek of 
Sicilian style. There is even in the best class a curious tendency to 
exaggeration, which gradually develops itself and finally becomes 
very barbarous. Roman Carthage has a bronze coinage which is in- 
significant. There are a few other towns which issued money with 
Roman legends, such as Utica. The denarii of Clodius Macer, who 
revolted in a.d. 68, are curiously illustrative of his policy, which was 
to restore the Roman republic. 

The cities of Numidia and Mauretania have a late bronze coinage; 
but an interesting series of silver and bronze coins is attributed 
with more or less certainty to the Numidian kings from 
Massinissa (202-148), to Juba I. (60-46 B.C.), and to the £"™f* 
Mauretanian kings from Syphax (213-202 B.C.), to Juba faala ' 
II. (who also struck coins with his consort Cleopatra, 
daughter of Mark Antony and the famous Egyptian queen) and 
Ptolemy their son, the last of the great family of the kings of Egypt 
(a.d. 23-40). 

II. Roman Coins 

The Roman coinage is of two great classes, — the republican 
and the imperial; the first lasted from the origin of money 
at Rome to the reform of Augustus in 16 B.C., and the second 
from this date to the fall of the Western empire in a.d. 476. 
The evidence of the coins themselves as to the origin of the 
republican coinage is at variance with thatof theancientwriters; 
but the general principles of criticism must be maintained here 
as in other matters of early Roman story. 

The tradition which ascribed the introduction of coins bearing 
types to Servius Tullius must be unhesitatingly rejected. The 
style and types of the earliest Roman coins point clearly to a 
date not earlier than the middle of the 4th century. The native 
copper which the Italians used from primitive times as a sort 
of medium of exchange, in amorphous blocks (aes rude) was 
probably not a state-currency, being produced by private enter- 
prise. It was not until Rome unified Latium and Campania 
under her rule that central Italy acquired a true coinage. This 
must have been about 338 B.C. The history of the republican 
coinage from 338 to 16 B.C. falls into two great periods— the 
second being marked by the introduction of the denarius system 
in 269. From 338 to 269 three minor periods may be distin- 
guished, indicating in a striking way the growth of the Roman 
organization of central Italy. In the period 338-312 Rome 
consolidated her dominion in Latium and Campania as against 
her rivals the Samnites. In the second period (312 to c. 290) 
she finally subdued the Samnites. The system of her coinage 
is from the beginning based on a double mint, one in Rome 
and one in Capua (perhaps also she struck in some other cities 
in south Italy). The weight-units with which she starts are, 
for bronze, the Osco-Latin pound of 273 grammes, for silver 
the didrachm of 7-58 grammes (the latter being g^ of the former 
and more or Jess coincident with the Phocaic-Campanian 
didrachm current in Campania). The relation between silver 
and bronze was as 1 : 120 or 1 : 125. The bronze unit was the 
as of 1 pound weight, which was divided into 12 unciae. The 
reverse type of all bronze denominations was a prow, which 
alluded to the establishment of Roman sea-power (in 348 she 
concluded her treaty with Carthage, in 338 she subjugated 
Antium, her chief rival on the Latin coast, and set up the beaks 
of the Antiate ships in her forum)*. The denominations are 
marked by I (the as), S (semis =£ as) and for the smaller de- 
nominations a number of pellets indicating the value in unciae. 
On the obverses appear the heads of deities: Janus on the as 
(see Plate), Jupiter on the semis, Minerva on the triens (4 unciae), 
Hercules on the quadrans (3 unciae), Mercury on the sextans 
(2 unciae) and Bellona on the uncia. These heavy coins were all 
cast at Rome. The Roman mint at Capua, on the other hand, 
produced a series of silver coins (chiefly didrachms) and small 
struck bronze change with the inscription ROMANO (see PI. II. 
fig. 24). In the second period (312 to c. 290) the mint at Rome 
continues to issue cast bronze of the same weights and types. 
But at Capua the mint becomes much more active, being opened 
for cast bronze as well as struck silver. The Osco-Latin silver 
standard is superseded by the Roman scruple-standard (1 
scruple of 1*137 grammes^-g-J^ of the pound of 273 grammes). 
Silver being to bronze as 1 : 120, 2 scruples of silver were equiva- 
lent to 1 bronze as of 273 grammes. The first issue of silver 
in this period consisted of didrachms (six-scruple pieces) with 
a head of Roma in a Phrygian helmet (alluding to her Trojan 
foundation), the inscription is ROMANO. Parallel with this 
is a Capuan issue of libral cast bronze (aes grave) for the use 
of the Latin territory; the 3-asses (tressis), 2-asses (dupondius) 
and as all have the head of Roma as on the didrachm, and the 
reverse type of all denominations is a wheel. (This wheel 
probably alludes to the completion of the internal routes of 
communication in Roman territory, especially of the via Appia, 
which was finished in 312). Finally, to this first issue is attributed 
one of the quadrilateral ingots generally known as aes signatum ; 
its types are the Roman eagle on a thunderbolt, and a Pegasus 
with the inscription ROMA NO M. These ingots, according 
to a plausible but not quite convincing conjecture, were probably 
not used as money, but only in sacral and legal ceremonies — 
such as dedication to the gods, venditio per aes et libram, &c. — 
in which the use of aes rude was traditional. But from this 
time onward each issue of silver and aes grave from the Capuan 
mint was, it is supposed, accompanied by a new ingot of this 
kind. Three further issues of silver from the Capuan mint 
took place in this period, each accompanied by its corresponding 
aes grave series and ingot. These heavy bronze pieces are all 
uninscribed; on the silver and small struck bronze ROMA 
replaces ROMANO. The evidence of hoards shows that in this 
period there must have been some sort of convention between 
Rome and the autonomous mints of her allies, permitting the 
circulation, throughout the bronze-using district under Roman 
control, of all the coins issued from Rome and Capua, on the one 
hand, and, on the other, all the aes grave issued by the autono- 
mous mints. In the third sub-period (c. 290-269) the silver 
coinage of the Capuan mint becomes thoroughly Romanized; 
its inscription is, of course, ROMA; its types are the typically 
Roman ones of the youthful head of Janus and Jupiter in his 
quadriga (these are the nummi 'quadrigati). There is also a 
series of struck bronze inscribed ROMA issued from the same 
mint. The important feature of this period is that bronze is no 
longer regarded as the most important element in the currency, 
but is subordinated to silver; the result is that we have what 
is called the semi-libral reduction, the weight of the as issued 
from the Roman mint being half the pound. But opinions vary 
as to whether the pound of which the as represented the half 
in this period was the old one of 273 grammes or the new Roman 
pound of 327-45 grammes. As the latter was certainly used for 
a special series of aes grave issued from the Roman mint for 
the Latins (see below), we may assume that it was also used 
for the regular Roman coinage. Now since the £ lb as (163*72 
grammes) was equated to 1 scruple of silver (1137 grammes), 
we get a forced relation of silver to copper of 1 : 144. The as 
being regarded merely as representing so much silver (r scruple), 
so long as the state guaranteed the cover, there was no reason 
why the as, being merely token money, should not fall in weight; 
and that it does, sinking by the end of this or beginning of the 
next period to the weight of £ of the Oscan or J (sextans) of the 
new Roman pound. We may note the occurrence in this series 
of the decussis or 10-as piece. Of the two series of aes grave 
issued in this period for the benefit of the Latin district, both 
are heavier than in the preceding period; the new Roman 
pound of 327-45 grammes is used for a series issued from the 
mint of Rome; a still higher weight (perhaps of 341 grammes) 
for a series issued from Capua. The relation between silver and 
copper involved in this standard is not quite clear. In this 
period also we have ingots corresponding according to the theory 
above mentioned, to the various series of aes grave; one, with 
a pair of chickens feeding and a pair of rostra, refers to the 
augury taken by the Roman imperator before battle. Two 
other ingots commemorate historical events; one, with a 
Samnite bull on each side, the subjugation of Rome's great 
rival; the other, with an elephant and a pig, the alleged rout of 
Pyrrhus's elephants by the grunting of swine at Asculum in 278. 
After the introduction in 269 B.C. of the silver denarius (piece of 
10 asses, marked X, PL II. fig. 25) with its half (the quinarius, 
V) and its quarter (the sestertius, IIS), no changes of obviously 
great economic importance take place in the coinage until near 
the close of the republican period. Although it is not true, as 
is sometimes stated, that the coinage of silver at all local mints 
in south Italy, except the Bruttian, came to a close with the 
introduction of the denarius, yet the new Roman coin entirely 
dominated the currency from the first. Many mints, however, 
continued to issue bronze coinage down to 89 B.C., and a Roman 
coinage in various metals is also attributed to certain local 
mints, such as Croton and Hatria; not to mention the Roman 
issues which still continued to be made from Capua, though in 
a less degree than before. At Rome itself the mint was now 
localized in the temple of Juno Moneta, who probably received 
her surname from, rather than gave it to, money. The denarius, 
being equivalent to 10 asses, and weighing 4-55 grammes, would 
at the rate of 1 : 120 (which was now restored) be equivalent 
to 546 grammes of bronze. The as of the time must therefore 
have been the one weighing 54-6 grammes, that is £ of the Oscan 
pound cf 273 grammes, or £ (sextans) of the Attic-Roman pound 
of 327*45 grammes. In other words, the legally recognized 
as of this period was the as of the sextantal reduction. The 
bronze coins of this reduction are, like the silver, struck, not 
cast; the process of striking had already been introduced for 
the lower denominations of bronze in the previous period. About 
241 B.C. the weight of the denarius, having sunk under the stress 
of the first Punic war, was fixed at 3*90 grammes. Possibly 
the reduction of the as to the weight of an uncia, which Pliny 
attributes to the time of the Hannibalian crisis, may really 
have taken place at the same time. In 228 B.C. (some critics 
prefer to say nearly forty years earlier) a new silver extra-Roman 
coin, the vicioriatus, was introduced. It replaced the old Cam- 
panian drachm and, wherever it may have been minted, was 
meant for circulation outside Rome. The quinarius and sester- 
tius at the same time disappeared from the regular coinage, but 
the sesterce remained the unit of account. Marks of value occur 
on all the coins from 269 B.C. for some time Onward, except on 
the smallest bronze and the victoriatus. After the reduction of 
the bronze had been carried far, it became possible to issue 
large denominations of a circular form; thus circular bronze 
decusses (equal each to 1 denarius) are known of various periods, 
weighing from over 1100 to 650 grammes. 

Gold was not regularly coined by the Romans until the close 
of the republic; but certain exceptional issues must be noticed. 
The earliest (some time during the first Punic War) consisted of 
pieces of 60 (PL II. fig. 26), 40 and 20 sestertii; they were issued 
both from Rome and from some external mint or mints. To 
the crisis of the second Punic War may be assigned certain 
electrum coins of ij scruple weight (types: janiform female 
head, and Jupiter in quadriga). It is to this time that Pliny 
attributes the fixing of the as at the weight of an uncia, and 
the valuation of the denarius at 16 instead of 10 asses (although 
in estimating the pay of soldiers the denarius continued to be 
given for io asses). Finally there is some probability in the 
attribution to the year 209 of the well-known gold coins of 6 
and 3 scruples which have on the obverse a head of the young 
Janus, and on the reverse two soldiers taking an oath of alliance 
over the carcass of a pig — in allusion to the loyalty to Rome of 
her Latin colonies (Livy xxvii. 9, 10). 

Without following the fortunes of the various denominations, 
we may note that in 89 B.C. the lex Papiria suppressed all local 
mints throughout Italy, ordered the reissue of the silver sester- 
tius, and introduced the semuncial (i ounce) standard for bronze. 
This was just after the close of the Social War, which had been 
signalized by the issue, on the part of the revolted allies, of an 
interesting series of coins (denarii and — most treasonable of all — 
a gold piece) chiefly from Italia, as they called Corfinium. 
These coins bear in Oscan letters the names of the Italian military 
leaders, such as C. Papius Mutilu's. In 81 B.C. the regular 
bronze coinage came to an end, and the denarius remained for a 
long time the only coin issued by the Roman mint. Roman 
generals sometimes, however, issued exceptional coins in their 
own names, such as " bronze sesterces." 

We have already dealt with the earliest gold money of the 
republic. Another exceptional issue was the gold coin bearing 
the name of T. Quinctius Flamininus, the liberator of Hellas 
(struck between 198 and 190 B.C.); but it was minted in Greece 
and conformed to Greek standards. The earliest Roman aurei 
proper (those of Sulla) were also struck outside Rome. They 
weigh $V or sV °f a Roman do und. The aurei of Pompeius were 
sV, those of Julius Caesar ^, of the pound. After Caesar's time 
the weight of the aureus fell to -^ ft, under Augustus. 

Of the administrative side of the Roman system of coinage little 
is known but what the coins reveal. The earliest indication of 
monetary magistrates is found in symbols, which occur on the coins 
before the close of the first Punic War. Then the names begin to 
appear, at first abbreviated, then at length. Probably the right of 
coinage was in the beginning vested in the consuls, but it would 
seem that about the time of the second Punic War it was transferred 
to a special board of magistrates, the tresviri aere argento auroflando 
feriundo. Whether they were appointed every year, or only when 
need arose, we do not know; but it is improbable that there was an 
annual board until the beginning of the 1st century, if then; and 
even when annually appointed, they cannot all have exercised their 
right. On the other hand, there were in some years, as 92 B.C., no 
less than fivemoneyers; in c. 86 B.C. there were four, two being 
aediles exercising a specially conferred right. Exceptional issues of 
this kind were often authorized by the senate, and bear inscriptions 
indicating the fact, such as P.E.S.C. (Publice ex Senates consulto). 
An issue Tor the purpose of the ApolUnarian games, defrayed out of a 
special treasury, bears the inscription S.C.D(e) T(hesauro). Julius 
Caesar added a fourth moneyer to the board. The first issue of gold 
by such a board took place in 43 B.C. ; all previous issues of gold had 
been made, so far as we know, in virtue of military imperium (in 
44 B.C. by the praetors). Augustus, after the troublous period 41-27 
was over, returned to the triumviral system; after his reform of 
15 B.C. the bronze coinage which he introduced in that year is signed 
by the triumvirs, although the gold and silver bears no such names. 
Shortly afterwards, however, he organized the system which will be 
dealt with under the empire. 

"The types of the Roman republican coins are of great interest, 
although their art never rises above mediocrity. The chief types 
of the period before 26$ have already been mentioned. The 
earliest denarii, quinarii and sestertii bear a head of the goddess 
Roma, helmeted, and the Dioscuri charging on horseback, as 
they appeared at Lake Regillus. The victoriatus has a head of 
Jupiter and a figure of Victory crowning a trophy. The types 
of the bronze coins are practically the same as in the earlier 
period. About 190 B.C. the goddess Diana in her chariot begins 
to appear on the reverses of some of the denarii. Later, other 
types gradually encroach on the reverses; first, Victory in a 
chariot; still later such types as the Juno of Lanuvium in a 
chariot drawn by goats. This and other types which now begin 
to relieve the monotony of the series usually have a personal 
allusion to the moneyer, or to his family history. Thus, on a 
denarius of Sex. Pompeius Fostlus is seen the shepherd Faustulus 
discovering Romulus and Remus suckled by the she-wolf. 
Imaginary or more or less authentic portraits of ancestors, such 
as Numa, L. Junius Brutus or M. Claudius Marcellus, belong 
to the same category. An elephant's head on a Macedonian 
shield, on a coin of M. Caecilius Metellus (c. 94 B.C.), alludes to 
victories won by Caecilii at Panormus (in 251, over Punic 
elephants) and in Macedonia (in 148). The cult of Venus by 
the Julian family is illustrated by a denarius of L. Julius Caesar 
(c. 90 B.C.) with a head of Mars and a figure of Venus in a car 
drawn by two Cupids. The surrender of Jugurtha by Bocchus 
to Sulla is represented on a denarius of Sulla's son Faustus (62 
B.C., PI. II. fig. 27). The type is probably a copy of the design 
which we know the dictator used for his signet-ring M. Aemilius 
Lepidus (TVTOR REGis) crowning Ptolemy Epiphanes, or 
Paullus Aemilius erecting a trophy, while King Perseus and his 
two children stand before him, are other historical types. A 
contemporary event is commemorated on a special issue in- 
scribed AD FRV(mentum) EMV(ndum) EX S(enatus) Con- 
sulto), coined by L. Calpurnius Piso and Q. Servilius Caepio in 
100 B.C. Caepio, quaestor in that year, defeated the proposal 
of Saturninus to sell corn publicly at a nominal price; but the 
senate voted a special issue of money to meet the strain of the 
market. On the obverse is a head of Saturn, from whose treasury 
the funds for the issue were drawn; on the reverse are Caepio 
and Piso on their official seat, and two ears of corn. Perhaps 
the most graphic allusion to a contemporary event to be found 
on any coin is furnished by the cap of liberty with two daggers 
and the inscription EID(ibus) MAR(tiis) on coins of Brutus. 
Representations of a less obviously historical character, as 
personifications of countries or places (Hispania, Alexandria) 
or qualities (Honos and Virtus) or mythological figures (Scylla), 
are all, it would seem, inspired by some personal interest. Many 
types will only be explained when more light is thrown on the 
obscure corners of Roman mythology and ritual; but they 
will all probably be found to have some personal reference to 
the moneyer. Roman types of the later republic, therefore, 
though they may be classified externally as " religious," " histori- 
cal," " canting," &c, are all inspired by some personal motive. 
The inevitable outcome of this character was that, when once 
contemporary portraiture was regarded as legitimate on the 
coins, it speedily became its most important feature. The 
portrait of Flamininus on his gold coin struck in Greece long 
remained without a Roman analogy. In 44 B.C., by order of the 
senate, the head of Julius Caesar was placed on the silver coins 
(PI. III. fig. 1; the gold coin' bearing his portrait is of doubtful 
authenticity). After Caesar's death portraits occur on coins 
issued by men of all shades of political opinion, showing that 
portraiture on the coins was not then regarded as the mon- 
archical .prerogative, which it became from a.d. 6 onwards, 
when it was limited to members of the imperial family. 

The history of the imperial coinage is full of metrological 
difficulties. These arise from the conditions fixed by Augustus 
(16-15 B.C.), by which the emperor alone coined gold >la J1 | g f lfr 
and silver, the senate alone bronze. Consequently 
the senate was wholly at the mercy of the emperor. Augustus 
struck the aureus at 42 to the pound, equal to 25 denarii at 84 
to the pound (PI. III. fig. 3). He introduced a new coinage in two 
metals, the sestertius of 4 asses and dupondius of 2, both in fine 
yellow brass (orichalcum), and the as semis and quadrans in 
common red copper. This distinction of metals, however, was 
sometimes ignored, as in the time of Nero,when we have sestertius 
(Pi. III. fig. 2), dupondius and as, all in brass, and of three different 
sizes. The as is usually nearly equal in size and weight to the 
dupondius, but is distinguished by its metal and inferior fabric. 
All this brass and copper coinage bears the letters S.C., scnalus 
constdto. Emperors not acknowledged by the senate are without 
such money; thus we have no specimens of Otho or Pescennius 
Niger. 

Nero reduced the denarius to ^th of the pound, and alloyed its 
silver with from 5 to 10% of base metal. Henceforward the quality 
Changes °* l ^ e denarius gradually sank, until under Sept. Severus 
under later the Drop 01 ** 011 of aI1 °y was from 50 to 60% Caracalla 
emperors* a ^ s0 * ssue d lead plated with silver and, among his aurei, 
p copper plated with gold. He also introduced a new coin, 
called after him the argenteus Antoninianus. It was struck at 
g^th to ^th of the pound, and seems to have been originally 
a double denarius struck on a lower standard. The character- 
istic of this coin is that the head of the emperor is radiate as Sol 
(PI. III. fig. 4), that of the empress on a crescent as Luna. Towards the 
end of Caracalla's reign the weight of the aureus had fallen to iu lb. 
Under Elagabalus the taxes were paid in gold alone; this was 
ruinous, for the treasury paid in debased silver at nominal value, 
which had to be used to purchase gold by the taxpayer at real value. 
Under Gordian III. the silver contained 67 % of alloy; and eventu- 
ally under Gallienus the *' argenteus " frequently contained no silver 
whatever. Aurelian (a.d. 270-275) attempted a reform of the coinage 
by which the previous coin was reduced from its nominal to its 
intrinsic value. The coins were now of bronze with a wash of silver, 
and we now find them marked with their value as two denarii. 
These coins replace at once the base silver and the bronze, which now 
disappear. The moneying right of the senate had become illusory 
by the depreciation of silver, which had ceased to have any real 
value. Aurelian entirely suppressed this right ; Tacitus and Florian 
restored it for a few years, after which the S.C. disappears from the 
coinage. The reform of Aurelian caused a serious outbreak at Rome, 
but was maintained by him and by Tacitus. Aurelian also suppressed 
all local mints but Alexandria. It was the work of Diocletian to 
restore the issue of relatively pure money in the three metals. He 
made no less than four unsuccessful attempts to regulate the weight 
of gold. Not later than 290 he restored a pure silver coinage with a 
piece of 5^ lb. His reformed bronze coins are the follis, marked 
XX, XX- 1., K, KA, &c. (all meaning " 2 denarii = the unit ") and the 
half-denarius of centenionalis. 

Constantine, probably in a.d. 312 (though some critics attribute 
the reform to Constantius Chlorus) desiring to rectify the gold 
coinage, which had long been quite irregular in weight, reduced the 
chief gold piece tov^ of the pound, and issued the solidus (PI. III. fig. 5), 
a piece destined to play a great part in commercial history. It was 
never lowered in weight, though many centuries later it was debased, 
long after it had become the parent of the gold coinages of Westerns 
and Easterns alike throughout the civilized world. The letters OB, 
which are commonly found in the exergue of gold coins from the 4th 
century onwards mean Obryzum (refined gold), and the letters PS, 
found on silver coins Pustulatum (refined silver). Under Constantius 
II. (a.d. 360) and Julian the silver coin of $*« lb was suppressed, and 
the siliqua of ii*th of the pound (which had already been issued in 
small quantities before) took its place. From about 360 there was 
a system of 4 bronze coins (follis, denarius, centenionalis and i 
centenionalis). The last soon disappeared, and under Honorius (395) 
only the centenionalis remained. Honorius and his successors issued 
the silver decargyrus ( = 10 denarii). The bronze coinage of this time 
was small and mean. It will be seen that a fuller system of bronze 
was originated by Anastasius, the Byzantine emperor. 

Under Augustus the Roman monetary system became the 
official standard of the empire, and no local mint could exist 
without the imperial licence. Thus the Greek imperial money 
is strictly Roman money coined in the provinces, with the legends 
and types of the towns. Many cities were allowed to strike 
bronze, several silver. The kings of the Cimmerian Bosporus 
' enjoyed the exceptional privilege of striking gold, which, however, 
became rapidly debased. The silver becomes h'mited about 
Nero's time, but lasts under the Antonines, and is also found 
under Caracalla and Macrinus. It is chiefly supplied by the 
mints of Caesarea in Cappadocia, Antioch and subsidiary mints 
in Syria, and Alexandria in Egypt. None of these were strictly 
city-mints, but served the purposes of the provincial govern- 
ment. The bronze increased in mints and quantity in the 2nd 
century, but, through the debasement of the Roman silver, one 
city after another ceased to strike about the middle of the 3rd. 
The provincial mint of Alexandria, however, continued to strike 
until the end of the century. From the coins of the ordinary 
Greek and other cities under the empire must be distinguished 
the issues of the Roman colonies. 'In the west these practically 
ceased in Nero's time; in the east they lasted as long as the 
other Greek coinage. Purely Roman gold and silver was coined 
in certain of the provinces, in Spain and Gaul, and at the cities 
of Antioch and Ephesus. When the base silver had driven the 
Greek imperial bronze out of circulation, Gallienus established 
local mints which struck pure Roman types. Diocletian in- 
creased the number of these mints, which lasted until the fall 
of the empire of the West, and in the East longer. These 
mints were (with others added later), Londinium (or Augusta), 
Camulodunum, Treviri, Lugdunum, Arelate (or Const an tina), 
Ambianum, Tarraco, Carthago, Roma, Ostia, Ravenna, Aquileia, 
Mediolanum, Siscia, Serdica, Sirmium, Thessalonica, Constan- 
tinopolis, Heraclea, Nicomedia, Cyzicus, Antiochia (ultimately 
Theupolis) and Alexandria. A few were speedily abandoned. 

As regards the internal organization of the mints under the empire, 
we know that, although the names of the triumviri monetales do not 
occur on the coins after 15 B.C., they continued to exist (with the title 
Illviri acre argento auro flando fenundo, although their competence 
was restricted to the first metal) until probably the time of Aurelian, 
who withdrew the right of coinage from the senate. Officials of the 
imperial treasury superintended the gold and silver coinage; Trajan 
placed a procurator monetae Augusti of equestrian rank at the head of 
the whole system, subject to the emperor's rationalis (the chief 
official of the treasury). The system of procurators was extended 
and regularized by Diocletian. In the Roman colonies (which were 
only allowed to issue bronze) the formula D.D. or EX D.D. (ex 
decurionum decreto) often occurs, corresponding to the S.C. of the 
Roman mint. At many colonies, especially in the west, the monetary 
duumviri sign the coins. At Rome the imperial mint itself was 
situated behind the Colosseum, near the Caehan hill, the senate re- 
taining its mint on the Capitol probably until the time of Trajan. 
The three monetae (of the three metals) appear together on 
medallions for the first time under Hadrian, and probably indicate 
the organization of the mints for the three metals in one place. 
From the middle of the 3rd century mint-marks begin to occur on 
the coins, indicating the various mints, the officinaein each mint, &c. 
Sometimes these marks form " secret combinations"; thus the 
letters I, O and BI found on three different coins of Diocletian 
(struck at three different officinae), and the letters HP, KOY and AI 
on three corresponding coins of Maximian, combine into Greek words 
representing the genitives of the Latin titles Iovius and Herculius 
assumed by these two emperors. 

The obverse type of the imperial coins is the portrait of an 
imperial personage, emperor, empress or Caesar. The type 
only varies in the treatment of the head or bust — if 
male, laureate, radiate or bare; if female, sometimes 22£ p " d 
veiled, but usually bare. The reverse types of the */ oa5 . 
pagan period are mythological of divinities, allegorical 
of personifications, historical of the acts of the emperors. Thus 
the coins of Hadrian, besides bearing the figures of the chief 
divinities of Rome, commemorate by allegorical representations 
of countries or cities the emperor's progresses, and by actual 
representations his architectural works. Types often occur 
purely personal to the emperor, such as the sphinx which 
Augustus used as his signet, or the Capricorn, his natal sign. 
The most remarkable feature of imperial types is the increase of 
personifications, such as Abundantia, Concordia, Liberalitas, 
Pudicitia — for the most part drearily conventional. The 
inscriptions are either simply descriptive, such as the emperor's 
names and titles in the nominative on the obverse, or partly 
on the obverse and partly on the reverse, and the name of the 
subject on the reverse; or else they are dedicatory, the imperial 
names and titles being given on the obverse in the dative and the 
name of the type on the reverse. Sometimes the reverse bears 
a directly dedicatory inscription to the emperor. The inscriptions 
on the earlier imperial coins from Tiberius to Sevenis Alexander 
are generally chronological, usually giving the current or last 
consulship of the emperor and his tribunitian year. It must be 
noted that Christian symbols first made their appearance on 
coins in an unsystematic, almost accidental way. The earliest 
instance is at the mint of Tarraco in a.d. 314, when a cross occurs 
as a symbol on the reverse. In a.d. 320 the Christian monogram 
is found as a detail in the field at several mints. But the types 
still remain pagan; these symbols are not introduced by order, 
although the officials who introduced them doubtless knew they 
could do so with impunity. As times goes on the Christian 
emblems become more popular; on a coin of Constantius II. 
we find Victory crowning the emperor, who holds the standard 
of the cross; the inscription is HOC SIGNO VICTOR ERIS. 
Another type of the same reign is the Christian monogram 
flanked by alpha and omega. Under Julian there is a temporary 
recrudescence of pagan types; with the revival of Christianity 
monotony of type sets in. 

The art of Roman imperial coins, although far inferior to that of 
Greek, is well worthy of study in its best ages, for its intrinsic merit, 
for its illustration of contemporary sculpture, and on account of the 
influence it exercised on medieval and modern art. On the whole the 
finest work is produced under Augustus, when the portraits still 
betray a certain refinement of imagination in the artists. Some of it 
reflects the beauty of Roman monumental sculpture in relief of the 
time, whether that sculpture be regarded as the work of Greeks or of 
purely Roman artists. _ The most vigorous portraiture is perhaps 
found under the Flavians. Under the Antonines, although still 
striking and powerful, the portraits lost in subtlety and from the 
time of Commodus there is a rapid decline. The age of Diocletian 
and Constantine shows a well-meant but hopeless attempt at revival 
of art. In spite of its defects, the fact that many of the greatest 
medallists of the Renaissance drew their inspiration from the art of 
imperial coins shows that it had many good qualities, of which the 
chief was an honest directness of effort. The realism in which this 
resulted is perhaps best seen in the portraits of Nero, the growth of 
whose bad passions may be seen in the increasing brutality of his 
features and expression. The medallion series is full of charming 
subjects, though when they have been treated by^ Greek artists of 
earlier ages the contrast is trying; the most satisfactory are the 
representations of older statues; the purely new compositions are 
either poor inventions, or have a theatrical air that removes them 
from the province of good art. 

III. Medieval and .Later Coins of Europe 
The period of the medieval and later coins of Europe must 
be considered to begin about the time of the fall of the Western 
empire, so that its length to the present day is about 1400 years. 
It is impossible to separate the medieval and later coins, either 
in the entire class, because the time of change varies, or in each 
group, since there are usually pieces indicative of transition 
which display characteristics of both periods. The clearest 
division of the subject is to place the Byzantine coinage first, 
then to notice the characteristics of its descendants, and lastly 
to sketch the monetary history of each country. The coinage of 
the present day, however, having certain definite characteristics, 
may be dealt with separately. 

The Byzantine money is usually held to begin in the reign of 
Anastasius (a.d. 491-518, PI. III. fig. 6). The coinage is always 
in the three metals, but the silver money is rare, and 
Byzan* was p ro b a bly struck in small quantities. At first both 
empire. the gold and the silver are fine, but towards the close 
of the empire they are much alloyed. The gold coin 
is the solidus of Constantine, with its half and its third, the so- 
called semissis and tremissis. The Byzantine solidus (besant) 
had an enormous vogue throughout the middle ages, being the 
chief gold coin until the introduction of the Italian gold in the 
13th century.' The chief silver coin was the miliarision, and 
a smaller coin, the siliqua or keration. Under Heraclius (610- 
641) the hexagram or double miliarision was first coined. The 
silver money of the restored Greek empire is obscure. In 498 
Anastasius introduced a new copper coinage, bearing on the 
reverse, at his time, the following indexes of value as the main 
type: M, K, I and E, 40 nummi, 20, 10 and 5. These coins bear 
beneath the indexes the abbreviated name of the place of issue. 
Justinian I. added the regnal year in a.d. 538, his twelfth year. 
The money of this class presents extraordinary variations of 
weight, which indicate the condition of the imperial finances. 
The Alexandrian coins of this class begin under Anastasius and 
end with the capture of the city by the Arabs. They have two 
denominations, IB and S, and T or 12, 6 and 3 denarii, and there 
is an isolated variety of Justinian with A T(33). The Alexandrian 
bronze never lost its weight, while that of the empire generally 
fell, and thus some of the pieces of Heraclius, while associated 
with his sons Heraclius Constantinus and Heraclonas, have the 
double index IB and M. Under Basil I. the bronze money 
appears to have been reformed, but the absence of indexes of 
value makes the whole later history of the coinage in this metal 
very difficult. There was one curious change in the aspect 
of the money. Early in the nth century the solidus begins 
to assume a cup-shaped form, and this subsequently became 
the shape of the whole coinage except the smaller bronze pieces. 
These novel coins are called nummi scyphati. The types, except 
when they refer simply to the sovereign, are of a religious and 
consequently of a Christian character. This feeling increases to 
the last. Thus, on the obverse of the earlier coins the emperors 
are represented alone, but from about the 10th century they are 
generally portrayed as aided or supported by some sacred person- 
age or saint. On the reverses of the oldest coins we have such 
types as a Victory holding a cross (other personifications all but 
disappear), but on those of later ones a representation of Our 
Saviour or of the Virgin Mary. Christ first appears on a coin 
of about a.d. 450, where He is represented marrying Pulcheria 
to Marcian. He does not appear again until the end of the 7th 
century, when His bust is introduced by Justinian II. It was 
perhaps this type, so offensive to Mahommedan feeling, that 
caused the Caliph Abdalmalik to initiate the Mussulman coinage. 
From the 9th century Christ appears in various forms on the 
coins; about 900 we find the Virgin; a few years later saints 
begin to appear. A remarkable type was introduced by Michael 
VIII., Palaeologus, who recovered Constantinople from the 
Latins in 1261, and issued coins with the Virgin standing in the 
midst of the walls of the city. The principal inscriptions for 
a long period almost invariably relate to the sovereign, and 
express his name and titles. The secondary inscriptions of the 
earlier coins indicate the town at which the piece was struck, 
and, in the case of the larger bronze pieces, the year of the 
emperor's reign is also given. From about the 10th century 
there are generally two principal inscriptions, the one relating 
to the emperor and the other to the sacred figure of the reverse, 
in the form of a prayer. The secondary inscriptions at the 
same time are descriptive, and are merely abbreviations of the 
names or titles of the sacred personages near the representations 
of whom they are placed. From the time of Alexius I. (Comnenus) 
the principal inscriptions are almost disused, and descriptive ones 
alone given. These are nearly always abbreviations, like the 
secondary ones of the earlier period. The language of the in- 
scriptions was at first Latin with a partial use of Greek; about 
the time of Heraclius Greek began to take its place on a rude 
class of coins, probably local; by the 9th century Greek inscrip- 
tions occur in the regular coinage; and at the time of Alexius I. 
Latin wholly disappears. The Greek inscriptions are remarkable 
for theirorthography, which indicates the changes of the language. 
In the nth century we notice a few metrical inscriptions, the 
forerunners of verse-mottoes on later coins. Of the art of these 
coins little need be said. It has its importance in illustrating 
contemporary ecclesiastical art, but is generally inferior to it 
both in design and in execution. It is noticeable that from the 
beginning of the Byzantine period the facing representation of 
the bust begins to be popular, and that from the time of Justinian 
(6th century) onwards the profile practically disappears from 
the coinage. The last Byzantine gold coin (a piece of John V., 
1341-1391) shows a figure of John the Baptist imitated from 
the Florentine coinage. 

Besides the regular series of the Byzantine empire, in which 
we include the money assigned to the Latin emperors of Con- 
stantinople, there are several cognate groups connected 
with it, either because of their similarity,or because the groups! 
sovereigns were of the imperial houses. There are the 
coinages of the barbarians to be next noticed, and the money 
of the emperors of Nicaea, of Thessalonica and of Trebizond. 
The last group consists of small silver pieces, which were prized 
for their purity; they were called Cornnenian white-money 
(a<TTpa KofxvrjvaTo) , the princes of Trebizond having sprung from 
the illustrious family of the Comneni. 

The coinage of the other states of the West falls into well- 
defined periods, which have been distinguished as (1) transitional 
period, from Roman to true medieval coinage, from the fall

1. The various coinages of the transitional period will best be 
considered together (see below). 

2. The inconvenience of gold money when it represents a very 
large value in the necessaries of life must have caused its abandon- 
Medie al ment anc * *^ c substitution of silver by the Carlo vingians. 
ev " The denier (denarius) or penny of about 24 grains was 
at first practically the sole coin. The solidus in gold was 
struck but very rarely, perhaps as a kind of proof of the right of 
coining. The Byzantine solidus or bezant was used and probably the 
equivalent Arab gold. The Arab silver piece, the dirhem, was almost 
exactly the double of the denier, and seems to have been widely 
current in the north. The new coinage spread from France, where it 
was first royal and then royal and feudal, to Germany, Italy, where 
the Byzantine types did not wholly disappear, England, Scandinavia, 
Castile and Aragon. In Germany and France feudal money was soon 
issued, and in Italy towns and ecclesiastical foundations largely 
acquired from the empire the right of coinage, which was elsewhere 
rare. The consequence of the extended right of coinage was a de- 
t preciation in weight, and in the middle of the 12th century the one- 
sided pennies called bracteates appeared in Germany, which were so 
thin that they could only be stamped on one side. The types of this 
whole second coinage are new, except when the bust of the emperor 
is engraved. The most usual are the cross; and the church as a 
temple also appears, ultimately taking the form of a Gothic building. 
There are also sacred figures, and more rarely heads,in the later age. 

3. The true herald of the Renaissance was the emperor Frederick 
II. In restoring the gold coinage, however, he followed in the steps of 
the Norman dukes of Apulia. With a large Arab popula- 
tion, these princes had found it convenient to continue 
the Oriental gold money of the country, part of the great 
sauce, currency at that time of all the western Moslems, and 
Roger II. (1130-1154) also struck Latin coins of his own as DVX 
APVLIAE, the first dueats. Frederick II. (12 15-1250), continuing 
the Arab coinage f> also struck his own" Roman gold money, solidi and 
half solidi, with his bust as emperor of the Romans, Caesar Augustus, 
and on the reverse the imperial eagle (PI. III. fig. 7). In workmanship 
these were the finest coins produced in the middle ages. But the 
calamities which overwhelmed the Swabian house and threw back 
the Renaissance deprived this effort of any weight, and it was left to 
the great republics to carry out the idea of a worthy coinage— ^a 
necessity of their large commercial schemes. The famous gold florin' 
was first issued in 1252 (PI. III.fig.8). The obverse type is the standing 
figure of St John the Baptist, the reverse bears the lily of Florence. 
The weight was about 54 grains, but the breadth of the coin and the 
beauty of the work gave it dignity. The commercial greatness of 
Florence and the punty of the florin caused the issue of similar coins 
in almost all parts of Europe. Venice was not long in striking 
(in 1284) a gold coin of the same weight as the florin, but with the 
types of a standing figure ofChrist.and the doge receiving the gonfalon 
at the hands of St Mark (see PI. III. fig. 9). It was first called the 
ducat, the name it always bears in its inscription; later it is known 
as the zecchino or sequin. Though not so largely imitated as the 
florin, the extreme purity of the sequin was unquestioned to a time 
within the memory of living persons. Genoa likewise had a great gold 
currency, and the other Italian states struck in this metal. It is 
significant of the power of the Italian republics that the later Mame- 
luke sultans of Egypt found it convenient or necessary for their 
position between Europe and India to adopt the weight of the florin 
and sequin for their gold money. Many varieties of gold money 
appear in course of time in France, England and to a less extent in 
other countries. The need for a heavier silver coinage caused the 
issue of the large denier (grossus denarius, gros or groat). This coin 
appears early in the 14th century. The types from the 14th century 
onwards are very various and distinctly worthy of the art of the 
time, which as yet is purely decorative and conventional, so that 
portraits are not possible. The religious intention also is gradually 
giving way to the desire to produce a beautiful result, and the 
symbol of the cross is varied to suit the decorative needs of the coin. 
Heraldic subjects also appear, and in the shield, which is frequently 
a reverse type, we see the origin of the usual modern reverse of the 
most important coins. 

4. 5. With the classical Renaissance we find ourselves in the

modern. Thig great coin speec ji]y became the chief European 
piece in its metal, but as it was coined of various weights and 
varying purity it failed to acquire the general character of the denier. 

The style of this age is at first excellent. The medals gave the tone 
to the coinage. Art had wholly thrown off the rules of the age before 
and attained the faculty of portraiture and the power ot simply 
representing objects of nature and art. Great masters now executed 
medals and even coins, but speedily this work became a mere matter 
of commerce, and by the beginning of the modern period it was fast 
falling into the poverty and barbarism in which it has ever since 
remained. The detaifs of the numismatics of these two periods 
belong to the notices of the money of the several countries. 

A word must be added on money of account. _ While the denier 
was the chief and practically the sole coin, the solidus passed from 
use as a foreign piece into a money of account. The 
solidus, like the German schilling (shilling), contained M° ot y° f 
usually 12 deniers. As there were 20 shillings to the mccouatt 
poundof silver, we obtain the reckoning by £ s. d., librae, solidi and 
denarii. The pound as a weight contained 12 oz., and its two-thirds 
was the German mark of 8 oz. 

It would be interesting, did space permit, to notice fully the art of 
this entire class, to examine its growth, and to trace its decline; 
but, as with that of Greek and Roman coins, we must 
mainly limit ourselves to the best period. ,This is a space b * 

of about a hundred and fifty years, the age of the classical Renais- 
sance, from the middle of the 15th century to the close of the 16th. 
The finest works are limited to the first half-century of this period, 
from a little before 1450 to about 1500, in Italy, and for as long a 
time, beginning and ending somewhat later, in Germany. The artists 
were then greater than afterwards, and medal-making had not 
degenerated into a trade; but with the larger production of the 

Eeriod following the work was more mechanical, and so fell into the 
ands of inferior men. The medals of this first period may not un- 
worthily be placed by the side of its sculpture and its painting. . Not 
only have some of its medallists taken honourable places in a list 
where there was no room for ignoble names, but to design medals 
was not thought an unworthy occupation for the most famous artists. 
There are, as we should expect, two principal schools, the Italian and 
the German. The former attained a higher excellence, as possessing 
not merely a nobler style but one especially adapted to coins or 
medals. The object which the artists strove to attain was to present 
a portrait or to commemorate an action in the best manner possible, 
without losing sight of the fitness of the designs to the form and use 
of the piece on which they were to be placed. For the successful 
attainment of this purpose the style of the later pre-Raphaelites was 
eminently suited. Its general love of truth, symmetrical grouping, 
simple drapery and severely faithful portraiture were qualities 
especially fitted to produce a fine portrait and a good medal. It 
is to be noted that their idea of portraiture did not depend on such 
a feeling for beauty as influenced the Greeks. Rather did it set before 
it the moral or intellectual attainments and capabilities, what the 
Italians called the virtU, of the subject. The German art, as seen in 
the medals, is mostly the work of carvers in wood or honestone, or 
goldsmiths. It excels in vigorous, realistic portraiture, and in 
decorative treatment of heraldic subjects, but is lacking in breadth of 
style and in the imagination shown by the best Italian medallists. 
Both these schools, but especially the Italian^ afford the best 
foundation for a truly excellent modern medallic art. The finest 
coins and medals of Italy and Germany have an object similar to 
that which it is sought to fulfil in the English, and their nearness in 
time makes many details entirely appropriate. Thus, without 
blindly imitating them, modern artists may derive from them the 
greatest aid. 

There are some delicately beautiful Italian medals of the 16th 
century, too closely imitated from the Roman style. A vigorous 
realistic school, the only great one of modern times, arose in Prance 
before the close of the 16th century and lasted into the next. It 
was rendered illustrious by Dupre* and the inferior but still power- 
ful Warin. From this age until the time of Napoleon there is 
nothing worthy of note. The style of his medallists is the weak 
classical manner then in vogue, but yet is superior to what went before 
and what has followed. 

It is not intended here to enter in any detail into the various 
divisions of the subject already treated in its main outlines. The 
questions that would require consideration are of too complicated 
and technical a nature to be illustrated within reasonable limits; 
the principal matters of inquiry may, however, be indicated. 

We begin with a survey of the transitional coinages in the 
various countries of the West. They cover the period from the 
5th to the 8th centuries, and are of immense historical 
significance. The types throughout are monotonous: ]£" s /" 
the bust of a Roman emperor or local ruler, a cross of co i aagcs , 
some kind, a Victory, &c. The style is quite barbarous. 
The classification of the earliest servile imitations ofRoman and 
Byzantine money rests solely upon provenance and is uncertain. 
The following general series are distinguished: (A) The Vandals 
(in Africa, 428-534) issued gold (?), silver and bronze from 
Hunneric (477-484) to Gelamir (53°"534) ; the gold is anonymous. 
(B) The Suevians (Spain, 400-585) had little but imitations of 
Byzantine gold; but Richiar (448-456) issued a denarius in his 
own name. (C) The Ostrogoths (Italy, 480-553) were preceded 
by the Herulian Odoacer (476-494), who coined silver and bronze; 
their kings (including Theodoric, 493-526, and Totila or Baduila, 
541-552) issued gold, silver and bronze in their own names, 
from Rome, Ravenna, Milan, &c. (D) The Lombards (Italy, 568- 
774) had no coins in their own names before Grimoald, duke of 
Beneventum (662-671); later there are gold solidi and thirds 
and silver from many mints. Gold was issued for the duchy of 
Beneventum in the 8th century. (E) The Burgundians (Gaul, to 
534) first issued recognizable coins under Gondebald (473-516). 
(F) The Visigoths ( South Gaul and Spain) had imitative gold 
thirds in the 5th and 6th centuries; the kings' names appear 
from Leovigild (573-586) to Roderic (710-711). Sixty-one mints 
were in operation. (G) The Meroving Franks first issued under 
Clovisl. (481-51 1) coins recognizably Frankish (solidi and thirds). 
Royal names first appear on silver and copper under Theuderic of 
Austrasia (511-534) and Childebert I. of Paris (511-558). The 
chief Frankish inscribed coinage is, however, of gold solidi 
and thirds, from Theodebert I. (534-548), who broke down the 
Roman imperial prerogative and issued gold with his own name 
in full, to the beginning of the 8th century. The last Merovings 
issued no coins in their own names, being mere puppets. And 
from the middle of the 6th century the coins with kings' names 
are far less numerous than those bearing the names only of 
mints and money ers; some 800 places (not only in what is now 
France, but in Germany, the Low Countries and Switzerland) 
are thus named (PI. III. fig. 1 2). This coinage seems to have been 
intimately connected with the fiscal organization, though the 
generally accepted theory that the taxes collected in each place 
were there and then converted into money is by no means proved. 
Certain religious establishments also possessed the right of 
coining in their own name. The close of the Meroving dynasty 
saw a revival of silver in the saiga, which heralded the introduc- 
tion of the denier. (H) The Anglo-Saxons began with an 
imitative coinage similar to the Merovingian, viz. gold, solidi and 
thirds , and silver sceattas ( = treasure, Ger. Schatz) of about 20 
grains troy, and stycas ( = pieces, Ger. Stuck) , first of silver, then 
of copper. The gold is rare and confined to the south; only two 
solidi are known, imitations of Honorius, with runic legends on 
the reverse. The types of the gold thirds, as of the coinage in 
other metals (which does not begin until the 7th century), are 
derived more or less directly from Roman. Some of the inscribed 
sceattas bear the name of London in Roman letters; others, in 
runes, the names of Epa and Peada (who is perhaps the son of 
Penda), king of Mercia (d. 655). Sceattas with runic inscriptions 
were also issued in East Anglia towards the end of the 8th 
century. But the sceatta was superseded by the penny introduced 
by Offa (757-79 6 )- Offa also struck a gold coin, bearing his name 
and an inscription copied directly from an almost contemporary 
Arab coin; but this is quite an exceptional issue, represented 
now by a unique specimen. The styca, which begins c. 670, was 
characteristic of the Northumbrian coinage, lasting, long after the 
introduction of the penny farther south, down to the Danish 
invasions of the second half of the 9th century. A series was 
issued by the archbishops of York. Wigmund (837-854) struck 
a gold solidus inscribed MVNVS DIVINVM, copied from the 
solidi of Louis le Debonnaire, and evidently meant for a religious 
purpose (PI. III. fig. 11). For the whole question of Anglo-Saxon 
coins see Britain: Anglo-Saxon. (I) The Frisians had a small 
coinage of gold thirds (imitated from Byzantine), and one 
with the name of Audulfus also exists (end of the 6th century?). 
The chief mint was probably Doccum. 

We now proceed to the consideration of the coinages of the 
various countries from the 8th century to modern times. The 
Portugal monev °* Portugal begins, after the expulsion of the 
Moors, with Alphonso I. (1112); it is exclusively regal, 
and not of great interest except as affording indications of the 
wealth and commercial activity of the state in the early part of 
the 18th century. The coinage of Spain, after the reconquest 
from the Moors, is almost without exception regal. The king- 
dom of Navarre had a coinage from the time of Sancho III. (1000- 

	Spaln 
	France, 

1035). The series of Castile and Leon begins with Alphonso VI. 
(1053) with deniers and obols. Aragon first has coins under 
Sancho Ramirez I. (1063). Gold (imitated from 
Moorish money) is introduced in the middle of the 12th 
century. A plentiful coinage was issued after the union of the 
crowns in 1479. The Spanish dollar of the 1 7th and 1 8th centuries 
was one of the most widely circulating currencies in the West (see 
PL V. fig. 5). The medals of Spain are not important. 

In 755 Pippin abolished the gold coinage of his Merovingian 
predecessors and introduced the silver denier (see PI. III. fig. 10); 
the coinage became a royal prerogative once more, and 
was confined to a few mints. The denier, which at first 
weighed c. 1-28 gramme (19^ grains), was for centuries the 
most important of European silver coins. Under Charlemagne 
the weight was slightly raised; the Caroline monogram appears, 
and there are other modifications in the types. Charlemagne 
also issued money from various Italian, German and Spanish 
mints. He also introduced the obol, and struck gold (chiefly at 
Italian mints). Among his types must be noted the temple with 
the inscription XPISTIANA RELIGIO. Louis le Debonnaire 
(814-840) was the last Carolingian to strike gold. In the 9th 
century are perceptible the first traces of the movement which led 
to the extensive feudal coinage. The advent of the house of 
Capet made no great change in the system, but the feudal issues 
now become important. The most widespread denier was that 
of the abbey of St Martin at Tours (denier tournois) ; the royal 
coinage was known as the monnaie parisis. St Louis (1 226-1 2 70) 
effected a great reform late in his reign, making the sou (hitherto a 
money of account) into a real coin as the gros (see PL III. fig. 14), 
and introducing a gold coinage. Henceforward the coinage increases 
in complexity; in the 14th century it has great artistic merit (see 
PI. III. fig. 17). The French medals are far more interesting than 
the modern coins. The earliest of artistic importance not by 
Italian artists show nevertheless strong Italian influence (medals 
of Charles VIII. and Anne of Brittany, of Philibert of Savoy and 
Margaret of Austria). A series of large medallions of the Valois 
is attributed to Germain Pilon. The most characteristically 
French artists are Guillaume Dupr6 (working 1595-1643) and 
Jean and Claude Warin (middle and second half of 1 7th century). 
The long historical series of Louis XIV. has no artistic value; 
but that of the Napoleonic period shows great technical ability 
on the part of artists like Andrieu, in spite of the false classicalism 
of their designs. 

The silver penny was introduced into England by Offa, king 
of Mercia (757-796), following the lead of Pippin in France (see 
PI. III.fig.13). It soon rose in weight to about 22 grains England* 
troy (1*42 gramme), at which it long remained. The 
types were usually, obverse the king's head, or some form of 
cross or religious symbol; reverse some form of cross, religious 
symbol or ornament. The inscriptions gave the names of the 
king and of the moneyer, later also the mint. An important gold 
coin of Offa was imitated from an Arab dinar of 774, with the 
addition of the words OFFA REX. The Mercian coinage ends 
about 874. The pennies of the kings of Kent extend from 765 1 
825; the archbishops of Canterbury went on striking to the 
beginning of the 10th century. The East Anglian regal serie 
extends to 890; the memorial coinage of St Edmund circulated 
largely in East Anglia in the 9th century. The penny appears in 
Northumbria with the Dane Halfdan (875-877) and continues to 
the middle of the next century. A coinage of " St Peter r 
pennies was issued from York c. 920-940. The coinage 01 
Wessex begins with Ecgbert, probably c. 825, when he got posses- 
sion of the mint at Canterbury (see PI. III. fig. 15 with the name 
of London). The coinage marks the gradual growth of Wessex 
until England is united under Edgar (957-975). There is hence 
forward for a long time no change of great importance in th 
coinage, which continued to consist of pennies, with rare half 
pennies (the pennies were usually cut into halves and quarter 
along the lines of the cross to make small change). During the 
reign of Stephen the monotony is relieved by a few issues by 
barons like Robert, earl of Gloucester. The number of mints is 
much reduced by the time of Henry III., and the moneyers cease 
to sign the coins in Edward I.'s reign. Henry III. made an 
abortive attempt to introduce a gold coinage, which was success- 
fully established by Edward III. in 1343, with the gold florin, and 
in 1344 with the gold noble (see PL III. fig. 20). (The obverse type 
of the noble, the king in a ship, is generally thought to refer to the 
victory of Sluys in 1340.) He also introduced the silver groat Ud.) 
and half -groat. The English coinage, both gold and silver, was 
now of such high quality and reputation that it (especially the 
silver sterling) was largely exported and imitated, chiefly in the 
Low Countries. The gold coinage of Edward III. is perhaps 
the most successful, from an artistic point of view, in the English 
series. Subsequent developments of the coinage now become 
very complicated. Edward IV. distinguished his noble by 
a rose on the obverse and a sun on the reverse, and introduced 
a new gold coin, the angel. The Tudor period is distinguished 
by the splendour, variety and size of the coins; Henry VII. 
introduced the sovereign of 20s. (240 grains) and the shilling, and 
on his coins the first serious attempt at portraiture is found (see 
PL III. fig. 21). Under Henry VHI.the quality of the silver money 
declines, being not effectually restored until the reign of Elizabeth, 
when an unsuccessful attempt was made to introduce a copper 
coinage. Private tokens came into use, but the official copper 
coinage does not begin until the next reign. The use of the mill, 
as distinct from the hammer, was begun in 1562, but it took just 
a century to oust the old-fashioned method. In 16 13 John, 
Lord Harrington, obtained a patent for the issue of copper 
farthings, and private tradesmen's tokens were prohibited. 
The gold sovereign of James I., from its inscription (FA CI AM 
EOS IN GENTEM VNAM) and the fact that it was meant to 
circulate on both sides of the Border, was known as the unite. 
The coinage of Charles I. presents great varieties owing to the 
civil war. The best workmanship is seen on the milled coins 
issued by Nicolas Briot. But the majority of the money was still 
hammered. The scarcity of gold in the royal treasury during 
the troubles induced the king to coin twenty- and ten-shilling 
pieces of silver, in addition to the crowns and smaller denomina- 
tions. Gold three-pound pieces, or triple-unites, however, were 
issued from the Oxford mint. One of the most remarkable 
of his pieces is a crown struck at Oxford by Rawlins. It bears 
on the obverse the king on horseback, with a representation of 
the town beneath the horse, and on the reverse the heads of the 
" Oxford Declaration." The so-called " Juxon medal," given by 
Charles to Bishop Juxon on the scaffold, is really a pattern-piece by 
Rawlins (see PI. V. fig. 1). Of equal interest are the siege-pieces of 
many castles famous in the annab of those days. They are mostly 
of silver, often mere pieces of plate with a stamp; but Colchester 
and Pontefract issued gold. The coinage of the Commonwealth 
is of a plainness proper to the principles of those who sanctioned 
it. The great Protector, however, caused money to be designed 
of his own bearing his head. It is not certain that this was ever 
sent forth, and it is therefore put in the class of patterns. 
Simon, the chief of English medallists, designed the coins, which 
are unequalled in the whole series for the vigour of the portrait 
(a worthy presentment of the head of Cromwell) and the beauty 
and fitness of every portion of the work. The finest coin pro- 
duced under Charles II., and technically the best executed piece 
in the whole English series, is the " Petition Crown " (see 
PL V. fig. 2), a pattern by Simon, to which, however — probably 
for political reasons — the work of Jan Roettier was preferred. 
Maundy money was first struck in this reign, and the name 
guinea was now applied to the 20s. piece. In 1672 a true copper 
coinage of halfpence and farthings was introduced. Hence- 
forward there is a decline in the coinage, although skill is perceived 
in the portrait of William III., whose grand features could scarcely 
have failed to stimulate an artist to more than a common effort. 
Queen Anne's money is also worthy of note, on account of the 
attempt, on Dean Swift's suggestion, to commemorate current 
history on the copper coinage,which led to the issue of the famous 
farthings (see PL V. fig. 4) . These have been the cause of an extra- 
ordinary delusion, to the effect that a very small number (some 
say three) of these pieces were struck, and that their value is a 
thousand pounds each, instead of usually some shillings. Worth- 
less casts of genuine farthings, and counters made in imitation of 
the sixpence of the time, are constantly mistaken for such 
farthings. After this there is little to remark, except the baseness 
of the art of the coins under the first three Georges, until the 
talent of Pistrucci gave a worthier form to the currency. Be- 
tween 1760 and 1816 hardly any silver or copper money was 
issued. The gap was filled by the use of Spanish dollars counter- 
stamped, and silver tokens issued by the Banks of England 
and Ireland, as well as by vast quantities of tokens issued by 
private persons. In 1816 the new coinage of gold and silver was 
issued, since when there have been few changes in the British 
currency. 

The English medals are far more interesting for their bearing 
on events than as works of art. The best are almost all by 
foreigners, but the fine pieces of the Simons form notable 
exceptions. The medals of the Tudors are good in Medals. 
style, and show some excellent portraits, in particular 
those by Trezzo and Stephen H. (generally known as Stephen 
of Holland). There is one of Mary queen of Scots by Prima vera, 
representing her in middle life, which is perhaps her most 
characteristic portrait. Elizabeth's are of historical importance, 
and some of them, as the Armada medals (see Pl.V. fig. 7), have a 
certain barbaric grandeur, being probably the work of English 
artists. The richer series of the Stuart period contains some 
medals of fine style. These include works by Warin, the Simons 
and the Roettiers, besides the excellent coin engravers Briot 
and Rawlins. The numerous badges worn by adherents of 
various parties during the civil war and Commonwealth have a 
personal and historical interest. The most curious pieces are 
those popular issues relating to current events, such as the so- 
called " Popish plot," and a certain interest attaches to medals 
of the exiled Stuarts. From this time there are no works deserv- 
ing notice except military and naval medals, the historical 
interest of which makes some amends for their poverty of design 
and execution. The English tokens form a curious class. They 
are of two periods: the earlier, which are almost always of copper, 
were issued chiefly at the middle of the 17th century and some- 
what later; the later, which are mainly of copper, but also 
sometimes of silver, were struck during the scarcity of the royal 
coinage in this metal at the end of the 18th century, and during 
the earlier years of the 10th century. Both were chiefly coined by 
tradesmen and bear their names. The colonial money of England 
was until lately unimportant, but now (except in style) it is not 
unworthy of the wealth and activity of the dependencies. 
The " Anglo-Gallic " money struck by the English kings for 
their French dominions forms a peculiar class. It was begun 
by Henry II., who struck deniers and half-deniers for Aquitaine. 
Richard I. (whose name is not found on his English coinage) 
struck for most of the French domains, but no coins are attri- 
buted to John or Henry III. Edward I.'s coins are of billon; 
of Edward II. there are none. Gold was introduced before 1337, 
and there are fine series of gold, silver, and billon of Edward III. 
(see PL III. fig. 19) and the Black Prince. Henry, earl of Lan- 
caster, struck silver at Bergerac (1345-1361). The succeeding 
kings down to Henry VI. (first reign) all issued Anglo-Gallic coins. 
There was a temporary revival under Henry VIII. at Tournay 
(1513-1519). The whole series,' with the exception of the Calais 
coinage, is French in character. 

The coinage of Scotland is allied to that of England, although 
generally ruder; but it seems to have been more influenced in the 
early period from England, and towards its close from Scotland 
France. The oldest pieces are silver pennies or sterlings, 
resembling the contemporary English money of the reign 
of David I. (1124-1153). David II. after 1357 introduced a gold 
coinage. In the 15th and 16th centuries there is an important 
coinage, both in gold and silver, not the least interesting pieces being 
the fine bonnet-piece of James V., and the" various issues of Queen 
Mary, many of which bear her portrait. The indifferent execution 
of the coins of Mary's reign is traceable to the disturbed state of the 
kingdom. The Scottish coinage came to an end in 1709. 

Wales has never had a coinage of its own, properly speaking. A 
unique penny attributed with good reason to Howel the wales. 
Good, a contemporary of Edmund (died c. 950), was 
perhaps struck at Chester. Various English kings struck coins at 
Welsh mints such as Rhuddlan, Pembroke. 
The money of Ireland is more scanty and of less importance than 
that of Scotland. The pieces most worthy of notice are the silver 
. - rf pennies of the early Danish kings, the earliest being that 
treana, ^ sihtric III. (989-1029), copied from contemporary 
English pennies. The Anglo-Irish coinage begins in 1 177, when John 
as lord of Ireland received the right of coinage. A copper coinage 
was introduced as early as the reign of Henry VI. The quality of the 
Irish coinage was exceedingly poor in the 16th century, especially 
under Elizabeth. Between 1642 and 1647 various kinds of money 
of necessity were issued, including the only gold Irish coin, the 
Inchiquin pistole. After his expulsion from England James II. 
issued enormous quantities of coins of necessity made of gunmetal 
or pewter. The latest Irish coins were the penny and halfpenny of 
1822. . . . 

The Isle of Man had a regular copper coinage, beginning in 1709 
with pence and halfpence under the Derby family, continued by 
. . . James, duke of Athol (issue of 1758), and by the English 
2 sovereigns from 1786 to 1864. The badge of the island 
n * is the three-legged symbol, with the motto Quocunque 
jeceris stabit. 

Belgium occupies the next place in our arrangement. Its 
coinage, which, except for the few mints operating under the 

Merovingians and Carolingians, does not begin until 
VJd Um the Ilth centurv > comprises many pieces struck by 
Holland, foreign rulers, and has littleof an independent character 

in either the regal or the seignorial class. The most 
important coinages are those of the house of Burgundy and 
Charles V. and his son, and of the bishops of Liege. In character 
the coinage of Belgium approximates to the French on the one 
side, the German on the other. About 1400 the Burgundian 
school produced a remarkable series of medals representing 
Roman emperors, of which two (those of Constantine and 
Heraclius) have come down to us; these form a link between 
the late Roman medallion and the Italian medal of the Re- 
naissance. The series of Holland is similar in character until 
the period of the revolt of the provinces. The Dutch dollars 
of the 16th to the 18th centuries had an immense circulation 
(see PL V. fig. 3) . Among the early Dutch medallists must be men- 
tioned Stephen H., generally without reason known as Stephen 
of Holland (working 1558-1572), whose ' portraits show great 
charm. The Dutch historical medals are of great interest, more 
especially those which were struck by the Protestants in com- 
memoration of current events. There is also a remarkable 
series of bronze medallets or jettons, which form a continuous 
commentary on history during the 16th and early part of the 
17th centuries. Both are interesting as largely illustrating not 
only local events but also those of the chief European states. 
Such are the pieces recording the raising of the siege of Leiden, 
likened to the destruction of Sennacherib's army, the assassina- 
tion of William the Silent, and the discomfiture of the Armada, 
affording striking indications of the zeal, the piety and the con- 
fidence in the right which built up the great political structure of 
the Dutch republic. After this time the medals lose much of 
their interest. 

The money of Switzerland illustrates the varying fortunes of 
this central state, and the gradual growth of the stronghold of 

European freedom. First we have the gold money 
land. °f tne Frankish kings, among whose mints Basel, 

Lausanne, St Maurice-en- Valais and Sitten (Sion) 
already appear. The silver deniers, which Charlemagne made 
the coinage of the empire, are issued by fewer mints; the dukes 
of Swabia began to strike at Zurich in the 10th century, and the 
empire granted during the 10th and to the 13th century the right 
of coinage to various ecclesiastical foundations, bishoprics and 
abbeys. Bern was allowed a mint by the emperor Frederick II. 
in 1218, and other towns and seigneurs subsequently gained the 
same right. The demi-bracteate appears about the middle of the 
nth century, and about n 25 is superseded by the true bracteate, 
which lasts until about 1300. The 14th century witnessed the rise 
of the Swiss confederation, and by degrees the cantons struck 
their own money. These, together with the coins of some few 
sees and abbacies, form the bulk of Swiss money of the medieval 
and modern periods. The separate cantonal coinage, inter- 
rupted by the French occupation, was finally suppressed in 
1848, when a uniform currency was adopted by the whole 
republic. The monetary systems of the cantonal and ecclesias- 
tical mints were extremely complicated. This was partly due 
to the variety of coins, partly to the debasement practised by 
the ecclesiastical mints. Geneva had a peculiar system of her 
own. 

Italy, with Sicily, has peculiar features. Here the barbaric 
coinages were mixed with the Byzantine issues which marked 
the recovery of the Eastern empire, and left a lasting 
influence in the north at Venice, and in the south at ^j ?*™,. 
Beneventum. Later the Arab conquest left its mark sicfiyf 
in the curious Oriental coinages of the Normans of 
Sicily and the emperor Frederick II., mixed after his fashion 
with Latin coinage. The earliest money is that of the barbarians, 
Ostrogoths and Lombards, and local Byzantine issues in Sicily. 
This is followed by the deniers of Charlemagne and his suc- 
cessors, supplanted by the gold currencies of the Normans and 
Frederick II. The age of the free cities is marked by the great 
coinages of Florence, Venice and Genoa, while the Angevin and 
Aragonese princes coined in the south, and the popes began to issue 
a regular currency of their own at Rome. The Italian princes of 
the next period coined in Savoy, and at Florence, Modena, Mantua 
and other cities, while Rome and the foreign rulers of the south 
continued their mintages, Venice and Genoa of the republics alone 
surviving. The Italian monetary systems have already been 
touched on in the introductory notice. For art the series is 
invaluable. First in Italy the revival influenced the coins, and in 
them every step of advance found its record. The Italian medals 
are without rivals in the works of modern times. 

Following the geographical order which is best suited to the 
Italian coinage, we first notice the money of Savoy, which is 
inferior in art to that of the rest of the country. It begins with 
Umberto II. (1080); in 1720 the dukes became kings of Sardinia, 
and their coinage merged eventually in 1861 in that of the king- 
dom of Italy. Genoa is the first of the great republics. She 
obtained the right of coinage from Conrad II. in 1139, and struck 
gold coins from the time of the general origin of civic coinage 
in that metal; these are ducats and their divisions, and after a 
time their multiples also. In the 17th century there are very 
large silver pieces. In the money of Mantua there are fine coins 
of Gianfrancesco III. (1484-1519) and Vincenzo II. (1627-1628), 
these last splendid examples of the late Renaissance, large pieces 
of gold and silver; the portrait is fine, and the hound on the re- 
verse a powerful design. The vicissitudes of the story of Milan 
find their record in no less than ten groups of money — Lombard 
regal coins, Carolingian deniers, money of the republic (1260- 
1310), next of the Visconti family (1329-1447), succeeded by the 
republic (1447-1450) and by the Sforza line, next of Louis XII. 
and Francis I. of France, of the restored Sforza, of Charles V. by 
Spanish right and his successors of Spain, and lastly of Austria. 
There are extremely fine coins of the 15th century, showing great 
beauty in their portraits (see PI. III. fig. 22). The money of 
Florence is disappointing in its art. The Athens of the middle ages 
had the same reason as her prototype to preserve as faithfully as 
might be the types and aspect of her most famous coin, the gold 
florin (see PI. III. fig. 8), and thus those who expect to see in this 
series the story of Italian art will be much disappointed. The 
silver florin was first struck in 1189. It is heavier than the denier, 
weighing about 27 grains, and bears the lily of Florence and the 
bust of St John the Baptist. These are thenceforward the leading 
types, the flower never changing, but the representation of the 
saint being varied. On the gold florin, first issued in 1252, the 
Baptist is represented standing, while in the contemporary 
silver florins he is seated. In the 14th century the arms of a 
moneyer appear in the field, two such officers have had the right 
of striking yearly, each for six months. The coins of the duchy 
from 1532, in spite of their new types, are not a fine series; the 
best are those of Alessandro, designed by Cellini. 

Venice as a mint even surpasses Florence in conservatism, and, 
the early style being distinctly Byzantine, this is the more 
striking in a great artistic city. We find Venice as an imperial 
mint issuing Carolingian deniers, but the doges begin to coin, 
placing their own names on their currency, in the 12th century.

The most famous silver coin, the matapan, was first struck in the 
brilliant time of Enrico Dandolo (1 192-1205). This coin is a 
grossus weighing about 33 grains, with on the obverse St Mark 
giving the standard or gonfalon to the doge, both figures standing, 
and on the reverse the seated figure of the Saviour. The famous 
Venetian zecchino or sequin (see PI .III . fig. 9) , the rival of the florin 
of Florence, appears to have been first issued under Giovanni 
Dandolo (1284). On the obverse St Mark gives the gonfalon to 
the kneeling doge, and on the reverse is a standing figure of the 
Saviour within an oval nimbus. Niccolo Trono (i47 I-I 473) 
introduces his portrait on most of his coins, hut this custom is not 
continued. By the latest part of the 15th century large silver 
coins appear. The archaic style changes in the beginning of the 
16th century, but there is no later movement. The large silver 
pieces increase in size, and large gold is also struck; the last doge, 
Ludovico Manin (1 788-1 797), issued the 100-sequin piece in gold, 
a monstrous coin, worth over £40. The doges of Venice from 
1521 to 1797 issued a peculiar silver token or medallet, the osella, 
five of which they annually presented to every member of the 
Great Council. They replaced the wild ducks (uccelle) which it 
had been customary to present at Christmas. Two dogaressas 
struck similar medallets. Their types are usually allegorical ; 
some are commemorative. 

The series of the coins of Rome is rather of historical than of 
artistic merit. The popes begin to strike money with Adrian I. 
(a.d. 772-795), whose deniers are in a Byzantino- 
Lombard style. The coins of his successors, with few 
exceptions, down to Leo IX. (1049) associate the 
names of pope and emperor. From Leo IX. to Urban V. (1362) 
there is no papal coinage at Rome. The Roman senate strikes 
from 1 188 onwards. We then see on the silver the style of the 
senate and Roman people, and ROMA CAPUT MUNDL Some 
coins have the figures of St Paul and St Peter, ethers Rome 
seated and a lion. Charles of Anjou, king of Sicily (1263-1285), 
strikes as a senator, and Cola di Rienzo (1347-1348) as tribune. 
The gold ducat of about 1300 imitates the types of the Venetian 
sequin. St Peter here gives the gonfalon to a kneeling senator. 
The arms of the moneying senator next appear in the field. 
The papal coinage is resumed at Avignon; and Urban V., on his 
return to Rome, takes the sole right of the mint. From Martin 
V. (141 7) to Pius IX. there is a continuous papal coinage. The 
later coins, though they have an interest from their bearing on 
the history of art, are disappointing in style. There is indeed a 
silver coin of Julius II. struck at Bologna and attributed to 
Francia, with a very fine portrait. We have beautiful gold coins 
of Giovanni Bentivoglio (see PI. III. fig. 23), lord of Bologna, who 
employed Francia at his mint, and we know that the artist 
remained at his post after Julius II. had taken the city. There 
are also pieces of Clement VII. by Cellini, vigorous in design 
but careless in execution. There were papal mints at Ancona, 
Bologna, Piacenza, Parma, Ferrara and other Italian towns; 
and coins were also struck at Avignon from 1342 to 1700. The 
papal portraits are highly characteristic and interesting. It is, 
however, in the fine series of papal medals that we find a worthier 
artistic record. 

The coinage of Sicily, afterwards that of the Two Sicilies, 
or Naples and Sicily, begins with the Normans. Theirs is a 
Skii curiously mixed series. It begins with Robert Guiscard 

as duke of Apulia (1075) and Roger I. of Sicily (1072). 
The gold money is almost wholly Arabic, though Roger II. struck 
the Latin ducat, the earliest of its class; the silver is Arabic, 
except the great Latin scyphati of Roger II. with Roger III.; 
the copper is both Latin and Arabic. The gold series {A ugustales) 
of the emperor Frederick II. (1 198-r 250) shows the first sentiment 
of reviving classical art, its work being far in advance of the age. 
These are Latin coins; he also struck small Arabic pieces in 
gold. Under Conrad and Manfred there is an insignificant coinage, 
copper only, but with Charles I. of Anjou (1 266-1 285) the gold 
money in purely medieval style is very beautiful, quite equal to 
that of his brother, St Louis of France. After this time there is 
a great issue of gigliati, silver coins with, for reverse, a cross 
fleurdelis6e cantoned with fleurs-de-lis. These coins acquired 
a great reputation in the Levant, and were even struck by the 
emirs of Asia Minor. With Alphonso, the founder of the 
Aragonese line, we note the old style of the coins, which are in 
singular contrast to his fine medals. Good portraiture begins 
on the money of Ferdinand I., his successor. The later coinage 
is interesting only for its illustration of the varying fortunes of 
the Two Sicilies. The curious early gold coinage of the Lombard 
dukes of Beneventum, which follows the Byzantine type, has 
been mentioned under the transitional series; the dukes and 
princes of Beneventum and the princes of Salerno continued to 
issue coins (sometimes gold, usually deniers) down to the middle 
of the nth century. 

Italian medals (PI. VI.) are next in merit to the works of the 
Greek die-engravers. Certain small pieces of a medallic character 
were made in Italy, at Padua, as early as the end of the 
14th century, and there existed also large cast and Medah* 
chased pieces representing various Roman emperors 
(perhaps Burgundian work of the 14th century), which influenced 
the beginnings of the true medal. This began, and also reached 
its highest excellence, with Vittore Pisano (Pisanello), the 
Veronese painter, whose medals date from 1438 (or earlier) 
to 1449- The finest work of Italian medallists is seen in the 
cast medals of the 15th and early 16th century; with the increase 
of classicism in the 16th the style declines rapidly. The earlier 
medals are independent works, marked by simple vigorous 
truthfulness. The designs are skilful and the portraits strongly 
characteristic; the expression of character and virtu takes 
precedence over ideal beauty, especially in the work of the 
Florentine school. As the art became popular the execution 
of medals passed into the hands of inferior artists, and by degrees 
striking became usual for the smaller pieces; at the same time, 
a slavish imitation of the classical style weakened or destroyed 
originality and stamped the works with the feebleness of copies. 
The great medallists of the first age are Pisano, Matteo de* Pasti, 
Enzola, Boldu, Sperandio, Guazzalotti, Bertoldo, Gambello, 
Niccolo Fiorentino, Lysippus, Candida, Caradosso. Some of 
the most beautiful medals, however, are by unknown artists 
(PI. VI. fig. 2). In the 16th century must be mentioned 
Pomedello, Benvenuto Cellini, Leone Leoni, Giovanni Cavino 
"the Paduan," Pastorino of Siena, Giacomo da Trezzo, Pietro 
Paolo Galeotto, called Romano, and Antonio Abondio. Incom- 
parably the finest of all Italian medals are the works of Pisano, 
particularly the medals of Alphonso the Magnanimous, with the 
reverses of the boar-hunt and the eagle and lesser birds of prey, 
those of Sigismondo Malatesta, his brother surnamed Novello (see 
PI. VI. fig. 1), Leonello d'Este, John VIII. (Palaeologus), Nicold 
Piccinino, Inigo d'Avalos (marquis of Pescara), Ludovico and 
Cecilia Gonzaga of the same family J.he great humanists Vittorino 
da Feltre and Pier Candido Decembrio. Pisano is great in 
portraiture, great in composition and design, and marvellously 
skilful in depicting animals. He alone represents the moral 
qualities of his subject in their highest expression and even 
capability. That he has high ideal power is seen at once if we 
compare with his portrait Pasti's inferior though powerful 
head of Sigismondo Malatesta. Pasti's medal of Isotta, wife of 
Sigismondo, is also noteworthy, likewise the medal by the 
otherwise unknown Constantius of Mahomet II., the conqueror 
of Constantinople — interesting works, but lacking Pisano's 
technical skill and inspiration. An artist of great power is 
Sperandio of Mantua; but his productions lack the finish 
necessary to good medallic work, his drawing and composition 
are careless, and his realism too often becomes brutal or vulgar. 
The work of Niccolo Fiorentino and of his pupils is astonishingly 
vigorous in portraiture, but they lack the power of designing 
reverses (see PI. VI. fig. 3). In the later age Cavino executed a 
remarkable series of imitations of Roman sestertii, which have 
been frequently mistaken for originals. In art these Italian works 
frequently surpass the originals in spite of a degree of weakness 
inseparable from copies. A comparison of the Italian with the 
Roman pieces is thus most instructive. The works of Pastorino 
of Siena (who had an extraordinary facility in graceful portraiture) 
are especially charming (see 1*1. VI. fig. 4). Historically the Italian 
medals supply the defects of the coinages of Florence and Rome, 
and in a less degree of Venice. The papal series is invaluable 
as a continuous chronicle, although artistically, after the earliest 
period, it is monotonous. 

The money of Germany is, like that of Italy, far too various 
for it to be possible here to do more than sketch some of its 
main features. In the Frankish period mints were in 
Germany. p erat j on at cities in the west, such as Mainz, Strass- 
burg, Spires, Treves, Worms, Cologne. Pippin issued denarii 
from Strassburg and Mainz; under his successors denarii and 
obols were also coined at other mints, as Bonn, Cologne, Spires, 
Treves. After the reign of Louis the Child (910-911) the 
Carolingian system was continued until the advent of the 
Swabians with Conrad III. (1138-1152). In the succeeding 
period, which ends with the introduction of the grossus and 
the gold coinage under Louis of Bavaria (1314-1347), the 
uniformity of the currency disappears. In the west (in Lothar- 
ingia, including the southern Low Countries, the Moselle and 
Rhine-lands, in Frisia, Bavaria, parts of Franconia and Swabia) 
the denier continues; hut elsewhere we find the hracteate. 
The right of coinage is acquired in an increasing measure hy the 
feudatories of the empire. These local coinages entirely domin- 
ated the system, so that even the imperial coinage is not uniform, 
hut consists of denarii in the west and bracteates in the east. 
The earliest imperial bracteate is of Frederick L; the large fine 
bracteates last but a short time, reaching their acme about the 
end of the 12th century (see PI. III. fig. 18). The fine pieces of 
the bishops of Halberstadt and the abbesses of Quedlinburg are 
characteristic of this class. With the introduction of the regular 
gold coinage (chiefly florins) and the grossus in the 14th century, 
Germany enters on the modern period. From the 16th century 
the thaler (so called from Joachimsthal in Bohemia, where the 
counts of Schlick first struck the coin in 15 18) dominates the 
silver currency (see PI. V. fig. 6). The thalers and other large coins 
of the 1 6th and 17th centuries are often good and always vigorous 
in workmanship. By the convention of 1857 the thaler was 
recognized as the unit for Berlin and the north, the florin of 
100 kreuzers for Austria, the florin of 60 kr. for the south. The 
present system, based on the gold reichsmark of 100 pfennigs, 
was established all over the German empire in 1 876. Of particular 
currencies in Germany we must be content with the bare mention 
of some of the more important. Among the great rulers we 
note the dukes of Bavaria, who coined from Henry I. (948-955), 
and issued fine thalers in the 16th century. The Counts Palatine 
of the Rhine coined from 1294, their mints being at Heidelherg, 
Frankfort, &c. The Saxon coinage begins with Duke Bernard 
(973) and includes a large series of hracteates and thalers, the 
latter being especially famous. The Brunswick coinage hegins in 
the nth century; besides its hracteates we note the large mining- 
thalers of the 16th and 17th centuries (up to ten-thaler pieces). 
There are good bracteates and thalers of the margraves of 
Brandenburg; from 1701 they coin as kings of Prussia. In 
Austria there is a ducal coinage from the 12th century; the gold 
florin of Florentine character appears under Alhert II. (1330- 
1358). The marriage-coin of Maximilian and Maria of Burgundy 
(a 16th-century reproduction of a medal made by the Italian 
Candida in 1479) k a striking piece, and in the 16th century 
there is a large series of fine thalers. The thalers of Maria Theresa 
had an enormous circulation among savage races, and those of 
the date 1780 were recoined for the purposes of the Abyssinian 
War of 1867. In Bohemia there is a ducal coinage from the 
early 10th century to 1192; then came the regal bracteates. 
Wenceslas II. (1 278-1305) struck the first German grossus at 
Prague (see PI. III. fig. 16). The gold florin appears under John 
of Luxemburg (1310-1347). In Hungary the regal coinage begins 
with St Stephen (1000). Charles I. of Anjou (1310-1342) intro- 
duced the florin and grossus. Of historical interest is the money 
of John Hunyady as regent (1441-1452). The abundance of gold 
about this time and later shows the metallic wealth of the land. 
The same is true of the rich gold coinage of the Transylvanian 
princes in the 16th and 17th centuries. Of ecclesiastical coinages 
the most important are at Miinster, Cologne, Mainz, Treves, 
Augsburg, Magdeburg, Spires, Wurzhurg, Salzburg.- The Cologne 
series of coins is almost continuous from the Frankish period; 
the archbishops first received the right from Otto I., Bruno 
(953-965) being the first to coin; from Pilgrim (1021-1036) 
the series, issued at various mints in the Rhineland, is very 
complete down to 1802. The series of Treves ranges from 
Theodoric I. (965-975) to Clement Wenceslas (1794). The 
archiepiscopal coinage of Mainz begins with Willigis (975) and 
lasts until 1802; its mints included Erfurt, Bingen and many 
other places. The Salzburg series (beginning 996) is remarkable 
for its fine thalers (especially of Mathias Lang, 1 519-1540). 
The patriarchs of Aquileia, who may be mentioned here, acquired 
the right of coinage from Louis II. in the 9th century, hut the 
first who can be identified on the coins is Godfrey (1184); thence 
onwards there is an interesting series of denarii and smaller coins 
down to the early 15th century. Of cities with large coinages it 
is sufficient to mention Aix-la-Chapelle (from the time of Frederick 
I. to 1795), Frankfort-on-the-Main, Hamburg (with great gold 
pieces of the 16th and 17th centuries, up to 10 ducats) and 
Nuremberg. Lastly, we may mention the coins of the grand- 
masters of the Teutonic Order, issued in Prussia from 1351 to 
1512. 

German medals perhaps rank next to Italian, although they 
lack the higher artistic qualities. They are the work of craftsmen 
— jewellers, wood-carvers, workers in hone-stone — and show great 
facility of minute workmanship and chasing and decorative 
design (the last is especially clear in the heraldic reverses); the 
faults of these qualities are to some extent redeemed by the 
native German vigour and directness of the portraiture. The 
original models from which the medals were cast were in many 
cases made in hone-stone or box-wood, which did not, like the 
favourite wax of the Italian artists, give much scope for subtlety. 
The chief centres of the art were Nuremberg and Augsburg. 
Many medals have been attributed to Albrecht„Durer; whether 
he did more than design them is uncertain. Among other 
medallists may be mentioned Hans Schwarz (working 1516- 
1527), Ludwig Krug, Friedrich Hagenauer (working 1525-1546, 
see PL V. fig. 8), Peter Flotner (c. 1538, although it is doubtful 
whether this artist, whose plaquettes are famous, » made any 
of the portrait-medals ascribed to him), Mattes Gehel, Hans 
Reinhardt the Elder, &c. Some other good artists are known 
only by their initials, or quite unidentified. After the middle 
of the 1 6th century the art declines, although we still have 
skilful artists like Valentin Maler (1 568-1 593). In this later 
period striking gradually supersedes casting. 

The earliest Polish coins are of the 10th century; the types are 
copied from English, German and Byzantine sources. In the 12th 
and 13th centuries there is a bracteate coinage. The Poland. 
grossus was introduced about 1300. In later times the 
town of Danzig, while belonging to the kingdom, issued remarkable 
gold pieces, thalers, &c, down to its restoration to Prussia (1793)- 

The origin of the coinage of the Scandinavian states: Norway, 
Denmark and Sweden, is clearly English and due to the Danish 
conquest of England. The runic alphabet is employed, sc&ndln- 
though not by any means exclusively, on many of the avia 
early coins of Denmark and Norway. The Norwegian 
series begins with Hakon Jarl (989-996), who copies the pennies of 
^Ethelred 11. In the second half of the nth century begins a coinage 
of small, thin pennies, which develop into bracteates. Magnus IV. 
(1263-1280) restores the coinage, more or less imitating the English 
sterlings of the time. Norway and Denmark were united under 
Eric of Pomerania in 1396. The money of Denmark beginswith 
pennies of Sweyn (985-1014) which are copied from the coinage 
of ^Ethelred II.; the coins of Canute the Great (1014-1035) and 
Hardicanute (1036-1042) are mainly English in character. With 
Magnus ( 1 042-1 047) other influences, especially Byzantine, appear, 
and the latter is very strong under Sweyn iEstrithson (1047-1076). 
Bracteates come in in the second half of the 12th century. The 
coinage is very difficult of classification until the time of Eric of 
Pomerania (1396). There arc important episcopal coinages at 
Roskilde and Lund in the 12th and 13th centuries. Sweden has very 
few early coins, beginning with imitations by Olaf Skotkonung (995) 
of English pennies and showing the usual bracteate coinage. The 
money was restored by Albert of Mecklenburg (1363-1387)- The 
thaler is introduced by Sten Sture the younger (1512-1520). The 
money of Gustavus Adolphus is historically interesting. Under 
Charles XI 1. there is highly curious money of necessity. The daler 
is struck as a small copper coin, sometimes plated. The types include 
the Roman divinities. At the same time and later there was a large 
issue of enormous plates of copper, stamped with their full value in 
silver money as a countermark. 

The earliest Russian coinage begins with the princes of Kiev as 
early as the end of the 10th century; it shows strong Byzantine 
p „/a. influence. The grand princes from the early 15th cen- 
tury struck curious little silver pieces. The coinage was 
modernized by Peter the Great, who introduced a regular gold 
coinage. The large silver and copper coins of his successors are very 
plentiful. Nicholas I. (1825-1855) introduced a platinum coinage 
of about two-fifths the value of gold. 

The Christian coinages of the northern Balkan States are of great 
interest. They are chiefly silver grossi, showing a mixture *of 
„ „ Byzantine and Venetian influences. The Bulgarians had 

Baikaa a re g U ] ar s Jiver coinage from Asien I. (11 86-1 196) to 
states* John Sismana (1 371-1395). The Servian coinage lasts 
from Vladislas I. (1234-1240) to the middle of the 15th century. 
There is also a coinage of the Bans of Bosnia (late 13th to 15th 
century). The modern coinage of the Balkan States is of interest 
only as a revival. The independent city of Ragusa is remarkable for 
the bold style of its early copper (13th century, inspired by Roman 
models of the 4th century) and the richness and variety of its 
later issues. 

There is a most interesting class of coins struck during the 
middle ages within the limits of the present Turkish empire, 

the money of the crusaders and other Latin princes 
gjj^* of the East. The multitude of states thus designated 

have been classed by Schlumberger, the authority on 
the subject, in the following order, the chief divisions of which 
are here given: First group, principalities of Syria and Palestine, 
counts of Edessa, princes of Antioch, kings of Jerusalem, counts of 
Tripoli, fiefs of Jerusalem, crusaders who struck imitations of 
Arab coins, kings of Cyprus, lords of Rhodes, grand-masters of the 
order of St John at Rhodes, to which may be added the later 
grand-masters at Malta; second group, Latin emperors of 
Constantinople, Frankish princes and lords of Greece and the 
Archipelago whose power was due to the crusade of 1204, such 
as the princes of Achaia, the dukes of Athens, Neapolitan kings 
who struck money for their Eastern possessions, Latin lords 
of the Archipelago, the Genoese at Chios, the Gattilusi at 
Mytilene, the Genoese colonies, the Venetian colonies, the 
Turkoman emirs of western Asia Minor who struck Latin coins. 
The most important currencies are the billon and copper of the 
princes of Antioch (Bohemund I., 1098, to Bohemund IV:, 
1201-1232) and the kings of Jerusalem (Baldwin II., 1118, to 
Conrad, 1243), the silver and copper of the counts of Tripoli 
(12th and 13th centuries) and the gold imitations of Arab dinars, 
the currency in that metal of the crusaders of Palestine. These 
Bisantii Sarracenati, or Saracen bezants, are at first imitations 
of Fatimite dinars, known to have been struck by Venetian 
moneyers at Acre, and probably at Tyre and Tripoli also. After 
these coins had been current for nearly a century and a half they 
were forbidden on account of their Mahommedan aspect by 
Pope Innocent IV. The Venetians then issued gold and silver 
coins with the same aspect but with Christian inscriptions. 
The kings of Cyprus issued a really good coinage in the three 
metals and in billon from Guy de Lusignan (1192) to Catherina 
Cornaro; from 1489 to 1571 the Venetians issued coins for the 
island. The coinage of the order of St John begins on the con- 
quest of the island of Rhodes (1309) and the suppression of the 
Templars; the earliest coins known are of Foulques de Villaret 
(1305-13 19), and the last of the Rhodian series are of Villiers 
de ITsle-Adam, the gallant defender of the island who was 
forced to capitulate to the Turks and sail for a new home in 1522. 
The coinage is of fine gold, silver, billon and copper. On the 
establishment of the order at Malta in 1530 it is resumed there till 
the capture of the island by the French at the close of the 18th 
century; it has little interest except as showing the wealth of 
the order. The other currencies of the crusaders, notwithstanding 
their great historical interest, are far less remarkable numis- 
matically; the influence of the denier tournois is, however, 
noticeable on the coinage of the princes of Achaia (1 245-1364), 
and the dukes of Athens (1 225-1308). 

Of the money of America little need be said here. Neither the 
coinages of the Spanish and Portuguese dependencies, and of the 
states which succeeded them, nor those of the English colonies 
and of the United States, present much that is worthy of note. 
In style they all resemble those of the parent countries, but, 
originating in the decline of art, they are inferior in style and work. 
They are most remarkable in the south for the abundance of 
gold and silver. The chief coin is the dollar. Some coins are of 
historical interest, and there are a few rarities, such as the colonial 
money of Lord Baltimore struck for Maryland, the pine-tree 
coins of Massachusetts, and the hog-money of Bermuda. 

IV. — Oriental Coins 

Oriental coins may be best classed as ancient Persian, Arab, 
modern Persian and Afghan, Indian and Chinese, and other issues 
of the far East. The first place is held by the money of the old 
Persian empire, the Parthians and the Sassanians. The conquests 
of the Arabs introduce a new currency, carried on by the Moslem 
inheritors of their empire. The modern Persian and Afghan money, 
though of Arab origin, is distinguished by the use of the Persian 
language with Arabic. The Indian currencies, though Greek, 
Sanskrit, Arab and Persian in their inscriptions, must be grouped 
together on account of their mutual dependence. They rise with 
the Bactrian kings, whose Greek types are gradually debased by 
the Indo-Scythians and Guptas; these are followed by a group 
of currencies with Sanskrit legends; next follow the money 
of Arab conquerors and the great series of the Pathans of Delhi 
and subsidiary dynasties, with Arabic inscriptions; the main 
series is continued in the currency of the Moguls, who largely 
use Persian, and the last series is closed by local currencies 
mainly with Sanskrit or Arabic legends. The Chinese coinages 
form the source and centre of the group of the far East, 
which, however, includes certain exceptional issues. The. 
order throughout is historical, each empire or kingdom being 
followed by the smaller states into which it broke up, and then 
by the larger ones which were formed by the union of these 
fragments. 

The Persian coinage was probably originated by Darius I. about 
the time that^ he organized the empire in satrapies. The regular 
taxation thus introduced made a uniform coinage necessary. Avoid- 
ing the complex gold system of Croesus, which was intended to 
accommodate the Greek cities in commercial relation with Lydia, 
Darius chose two weights, the gold shekel of 8-4 grammes and the 
silver drachm of 5*58grammes. One gold piece was equal to twenty 
silver. The gold coin was called the daric, the, silver the siglos. 
The metal was very pure, especially that of the daric. Thus not 
only were the Lydian gold and silver coins of inferior weight thrown 
out of circulation, but the Persian gold, from its purity, became 
dominant, and was the chief gold currency of the ancient world so 
long as the empire lasted. The issuing of gold was a royal pre- 
rogative. Silver money was coined not only by the king but in the 
provinces by satraps, who used local types, and by tributary states. 
The following classes must be distinguished: (1) regal, (2) satrapal, 
(3) of tributary states. The art of Persian coins varies according 
to the locality, from the beautiful purely Greek work of the west coast 
of Asia Minor to the more formal style of Cilicia and the thoroughly 
hieratic stiffness of Phoenicia and Persia. 

The regal coinage is of darics (PI. IV. fig. 2) and subdivisions in gold 
and of sigli and subdivisions in silver. The obverse type is the king 
as an archer, the reverse an irregular oblong incuse. The darics show 
differences of style, and must extend through the whole period of the 
empire. The sigli no doubt run parallel with them. Both these 
denominations are uninscribed. 

The satrapal coinage is very important and interesting. It 
belongs mainly to Cilicia. The most remarkable series is that with 
a bearded head wearing a tiara, with various reverses, struck appar- 
ently at Colophon, Cyzicus and Lampsacus, and in one instance 
bearing the name of the satrap Pharnabazus, but usually the word 
" king " in Greek. The coin of Colophon shows a splendid portrait, 
one of the finest instances of Ionian work. It probably represents 
Pharnabazus (see PI. IV. fig. 1). m Of pther satrapal issues those of 
Datames, of Tiribazus and Cilician^ issues, struck at Tarsus, are 
specially noteworthy. Their inscriptions are Aramaic. 

The coinages of the tributary states have been in part noticed in 
their geographical order. 

After the fall of the empire, the generals and satraps such as 
Mazaeus who governed Alexander's newly-acquired dominions issued 
coins from various mints, especially Babylon. The gold coins were 
double darics of the same types as their single predecessors. The 
silver coins were mainly modelled on the coins which Mazaeus had 
previously issued in Cilicia with the types of Baal-Taro and Lion. 
Some of them may have been issued as far East as Bactria and North 
West India. These are followed by the first native coinage, in- 
scribed below under India. 

The conquest of Alexander did not wholly destroy the independ- 
ence of Persia. Within less than a century the warlike Parthians, 
once subjects of Persia, revolted (249-248 B.C.) against 
Parthians. t jj e Seleucids and formed a kingdom which speedily 
became an empire, ultimately the one successful rival of Rome. 
Their money is Greek in standard and inscriptions, as well as 
in the origin of types. The coins are silver, following the Attic 
weight, the chief piece being the drachm, though the tetradrachm is 
not infrequent; there are also bronze coins, but none in gold are 
known. The drachm has the head of the king on the obverse, 
diademed or with a regal head-dress, and on the reverse the founder 
Arsaccs seated, holding a strung bow, the later tetradrachms varying 
this uniformity. Every king is styled Arsaces, to which many of the 
later sovereigns add their proper names. The inscriptions are 
usually loner, reaching a climax in such as BA2IAEH2 BA2IAEHN 
METAAOY APSAKOY AIKAIOY Eni^ANOYS 0EOY EYIIA- 
T0P02 *IAEAAHNOS of Mithradates III. (57-54 B.C.; see PI. IV. 
fig. 4), where we see the double influence of Persian and Seleucid styles 
and the desire to conciliate the Greek cities. Very noticeable are the 
coins which bear the portraits of Phraataces (3 B.c-A.D.4) and his 
mother, the Italian slave Musa, with the title queen (GEAS 
0YPANIA2 MOYSHS BA2IAISSHS). The last ot the Parthian 
coins are those attributed to Artavasdes (c. a.d. 227). 

The coinage of Persis, beginning in the second half of the 3rd 
century B.C., consists of silver tetradrachms and drachms; the 
earliest have fine portraits of the kings, but the style 
Persis* rapidly degenerates. The prevailing reverse type is the 
Persian fire-altar. 

The dynasts of Characene, on the lower Tigris, issued coins (silver, 
bronze and base metal) from the time of the founder, Hyspaosines 
(c. 124 B.C.), down to the 2nd century a.d. The obverses 
Characene. f ^ie tetradrachms have portraits of the kings; the 
usual reverse type is a seated Heracles. 

The Persian line of the Sassanians arose about A.D. 220, and 
wrested the empire from the Parthians in 226-227, under the leader- 
ship of Ardashir or Artaxerxes. This dynasty issued a 
sassa* national and thus Oriental coinage in gold and silver. 
The denominations follow the Roman system, and there 
are but two coins, equivalent to the aureus or solid us and the denarius. 
The obverse has the king's bust, usually wearing a very large and 
elaborate head-dress, varied with each sovereign, and the reverse the 
sacred fire-altar (sec PI. IV. fig. 3) ordinarily flanked by the king and 
a priest. The attachment which Ardashir, the founder, bore to Zoro- 
astrianism established this national reverse type, which endured 
through the four hundred years of the sovereignty of his line to 
a.d. 652. The inscriptions are Pahlayi. 

The Arab coinage forms the most important Oriental group. It 
has a duration of twelve centuries and a half, and at its widest 
geographical extension was coined from Morocco to the 
caliphates. b orc fers of China. When the Arabs made their great con- 
quests money became a necessity. They first adopted in the 
East imitations of the current Persian silver pieces of the last 
Sassanians, but in Syria and Palestine of the Byzantine copper, in 
Africa of the gold of the same currency. Of these early coins the 
Sassanian imitations are very curious with Pahlavi inscriptions and 
shorter ones in Arabic (Cufic). The regular coinage with purely 
Moslem inscriptions begins with the issue of a silver coin at Basrah, 
in 40 a.h. (a.d. 660), by the caliph 'AH; after subsequent efforts thus 
to replace the Sassanian currency, the orthodox mintage was finally 
established, in 76 a.h. (a.d. 695), by Abdalmalik. The names of the 
denominations and the weight of the gold are plainly indicative of 
Byzantine influence. There were three coins. The dinar of gold 
(PI. IV. fig. 6) took its name from the aureus or denarius aureus, of 
which the solidus must have been held to be the representative, for 
the weight of the Arab coin (about 4*3 grammes) is clearly derived from 
the Byzantine gold piece. The dirhem of silver (see PI. IV. fig. 7) is 
in name a revival of the Greek drachm ; it weighs at most about 3 
grammes. The copper piece is the fels, taking its name from the 
follis of the Greek empire. Commercially the gold easily exchanged, 
and the silver soon passed as the double of the Carolingian denier. 
For long these were the only coins issued, except, and this but rarely, 
half and quarter dinars. There are properly no types. There was 
indeed an attempt in the early Byzantino-Arab money to represent 
the caliph, and in the course 01 ages we shall observe some deviations 
t'om the general practice of Islam, particularly in the coinage of the 
atabegs and in Mahommedan coinages not of the Arab group, the 
modern Persian and that of the Moguls of Delhi. The inscriptions 
are uniformly religious, save in some Tatar coinages and that of the 
Turks. In general the coins are for the first five centuries of their 
issue remarkably uniform in fabric and general appearance. They 
are always flat and generally thin. The whole of both sides of the 
coins is occupied by inscriptions in the formal Cufic character 
usually arranged horizontally in the area and in a single or double 
band around, ^wards the fall of the caliphate a new type of coin 
begins, mainly 4kpng in the greater size of the pieces. There are 
new multiples of the dinar and ultimately of the dirhem, and the 
silver pieces frequently have their inscriptions within and around a 
square, a form also used for gold. The Cufic character becomes 
highly ornamental, and speedily gives way to the flexuous naskhl of 
modern writing. The inscriptions are religious, with the addition 
of the year by the era of the Flight (a.d. 622), the month sometimes 
being added, and the mint occurs uniformly on silver and copper, but 
docs not appear on the gold until after the fall of the Omayyad 
dynasty. Subsequently the official name of the caliph occurs. The ■ 
religious part of the inscriptions is various, the most usual formulae 
being the profession of the Moslem faith: " There is no deity but 
God; Mahomet is the apostle of God," to which the Shi'itcs or 
followers of 'AH in Persia and Africa add " *Ali is the friend of God." 
The Moorish coins give long formulae and religious citations and 
ejaculations, and they, likc^ the money of the Pathans of Delhi of 
the Indian class, have occasionally admonitions urging or suggesting 
the purer use of wealth. As Arab and other dynasties arose from 
the dismemberment of the caliphate, the names of kings occur, but 
for centuries they continued to respect the authority of their re- 
ligious chief by coining in his name, even in the case of the shadowy 
Abbasids of Egypt, adding their own names even when at war with 
the caliph, as though they were mere provincial governors. After the 
fall of the caliphate some new denominations came in, chiefly of 
heavier weight than the dirhem and dinar, but the influence of the 
commercial states of Italy made the later Egyptian Mamelukes, the 
Turks and the later Moors adopt the gold sequin. In more modern 
times the dollar found its way into the Moslem coinage of the states 
bordering on the Mediterranean. It can be readily seen that Arab 
coins have no art in the same sense as those of the Greeks. The 
beautiful inscriptions and the arabesque devices of the pieces of the 
close of the middle ages have, however, a distinct artistic merit. 

The Omayyad coins owe their only historical value to the evidence 
which the silver affords of the extent of the empire at different 
times. The first separation of that empire dates from 
the overthrow of this dynasty (which had its capital at Omayyads. 
Damascus, a.d. 661-750) by the 'Abbasids (a.d. 750, capital Bagdad) 
speedily followed by the formation of the rival Omayyad 
caliphate of the West with its capital at Cordova. The Abb * sias * 
Abbasid money has the same interest as that which it succeeded, but 
its information is fuller. Towards the fall of the line (which ended at 
Bagdad in 1258) it becomes very handsome in the great coins, which 
are multiples of the dinar (see PI. IV. fig. 10). The Spanish Omayyads 
(756-1031) struck silver almost exclusively. Their rise was followed 
by that of various lesser lines — the Idrisites (788-985, silver) and 
Aghlabites (800-909, gold chiefly) in western Africa, the Beni Tulun 
(868-905, gold), and, after a short interval, the Ikhshidids (935-969, 
gold), both of Turkish origin, in Egypt. Meanwhile a new caliphate 
arose (909) in western Africa which subdued Egypt (969), the 
Fatimid of the line of 'Ali, and for a while the allegiance of the 
Moslems was divided between three rivaP lines, the Omayyads of 
Spain, the Fatimids of Africa, and the Abbasids of Bagdad. The 
Fat im ids introduced a new type of dinar, with the inscriptions in 
concentric circles, and struck little but gold. In the interim the 
Persians, who had long exercised a growing influence at the court of 
Bagdad, revived their power in a succession of dynasties which ac- 
knowledged the supremacy of the caliphate of Bagdad, but were 
virtually independent. These were the Tahirids (820-872), Saffarids 
(867-903), Samanids (874-999), Ziyarids (928-1042), and Buwoyhids 
or Buy ids (932-1055), who mostly struck silver, but the last gold also. 
As the Persians had supplanted the Arabs, so they were in turn 
forced to give place to the Turks. The Ghaznevids formed a powerful 
kingdom in Afghanistan (962-1186, gold and silver), and the 
Seljuks established an empire (gold), which divided into several 
kingdoms, occupying the best part of the East (103 7-1 104). Of these 
dynasties the Seljuks of Rum or Asia Minor (1 077-1 300) first strike a 
modern type of Arab coinage (silver, PI. IV. fig. 9). 

The Sehuk dominions separated into many small states, the 
central ruled by atabegs or generals (i2th-i^th cent.), and the 
similar Turkoman Urtulps (1101-1312). The atabeg money and that 
of the Turks of the house of Urtuk are mainly large copper pieces 
bearing on one side a figure borrowed from Greek, Roman,^ Byzantine 
and other sources. They form a most remarkable innovation (PI. IV. 
fig. 1 1 ) . In the same age the great but short-lived empire of Khwarizm " 
(Khiva, 1150-1231) arose in the far East. The first caliphate to 
disappear was thatof^ Spain, which broke up (r. 1031) into small 
dynasties, some claiming the prerogative of the caliphates. They 
chiefly struck base silver (billon) coins. The Christian kings gradu- 
ally overthrew most of these lines. In the meantime various Berber 
families had gained power in western Africa and the Almoravides and 
the Almohades crossed the straits and restored the Moslem power in 
Spain. They struck gold money of fine work, and that of the later 
Muwahljids is remarkable for its size and thinness. At the fall of the 
Muwabbids the only powerful kingdom remaining was the Arab 
house of Granada (Nasrids), which, supported by the Berbers of 
Africa, lingered on until the days of Ferdinand and Isabella (U9 2 )* 
The Fatimite dynasty was supplanted by the Kurdish line of the 
Ayyubites, the family of Saladin, who from 1169 to 1250 ruled 
Egypt, Syria and Mesopotamia, with a number of vassal states, some 
governed by princes of their own family, some by the older lines of the 
atabeg class which they allowed to survive. In Egypt the Ayyubite 
coinage is of gold, elsewhere of silver and copper. The caliphate of 
Bagdad, which latterly was almost limited to that town, though its 
abundant heavy gold coinage at this very time indicates great wealth, 
was overthrown by the new power of the Mongols (a.d. 1258), who 
established a group of empires and kingdoms, comprising the whole 
Eastern world eastward of the Euphrates and thence extending 
northward and reaching into Europe. The most important ot these 
states for their money are that of the Mongols of Persia (1 256-1 349)* 
founded by Hulagu, the conqueror of Bagdad, and that of the khans 
of the Golden Horde (1224-1502). Both struck silver, but there is 
also gold coinage of the Mongols of Persia, who more frequently use 
the Mongol character for their names and titles than is done under the 
kindred line. The power of the Mongols was beld in check by the 
Mameluke kings of Egypt and Syria, slave-princes of two dynasties, 
the Babri (1250-1390) and the Burji (1382-1517), who struck money 
in the three metals. The Mongol power waned, but was revived by 
Timur (Tamerlane), who during his rule (1 369-1 405) recovered all 
that had been lost. He and his successors (to 1500) struck silver, 
copper, and brass money (see PI. IV. fig. 13). The Ottoman Turks, 
whose power had been gradually growing from 1299 onwards, after a 
desperate struggle with Timur (defeat of Bayezid I. at Angora in 
1402), gradually absorbed the whole Mahommedan world west of the 
Tigris, except only Morocco, where they had but a momentary 
dominion. Constantinople fell to them in 1453, Syria, Egvpt and 
Arabia in 151 7. Their money of gold, silver, base metal and bronze 
is devoid of historical interest. In Tunis and Morocco a group of 
Berber lines long maintained themse'ves, but at length only .one 
survived, that of the sharifs of Morocco, claiming Arab descent, now 
ruling as the sole independent Moslem dynasty of northern Africa. 
Its recent coinage is singularly barbarous. It may be remarked that 
Tunis and Egypt have long coined Turkish money in their own 
mints, the more western state latterly adding the name of its here- 
ditary prince to that of the sultan. 

The coins of the shahs of Persia have their origin with Isma'fl 
(1502). They are struck in the three metals, and arc remarkable 
for the elegance of their inscriptions, sometimes in flowing 
Persia. Arabic, sometimes in the still more flexuous native char- 
acter (see PI. IV. fig. 12). The inscriptions are at first Arabic ; after a 
time the religious formulae are in this language and the royal legend in 
Persian, usually as a poetical distich. The Persian series is also re- 
markable for the autonomous issues of its cities in copper, the obverse 
bearing some type, usually an animal. The coins of the Afghan amirs 
form a class resembling in inscriptions those of the Persians, and 
equally using Persian distichs. They commence with Ahmad Shah 
Durrani (1747)^ 

The first native Indian coinage consists of primitive pieces (the 
earliest perhaps of the 4th century B.C.) of silver and copper 
with countermarks (known as "punch-marked" coins). 
India. Foreign ccins (Persian and Athenian) circulated in the 

country from the 5th century; the silver coinage of Sophy tes, a con- 
temporary of Alexander the Great, shows Athenian influence; and 
there are not a few coins of Indian provenance showing direct imita- 
tion or modification of Athenian types (as the substitution of an eagle 
for the owl). Alexander himself is represented by a coinage of 
square bronze pieces. Certain tetradrachms and diobols with the 
name of Alexander and types: head of Zeus and eagle, probably 
belong to the end of the 4th century. But the coinage which was to 
have most effect on that of India was the Bactrian (see also under 
Bactria). This is at first a pure Greek coinage, of fine style, begin- 
ning with Diodotus (gold, silver, bronze), who revolted from Antiocnus 
II., c, 250 B.C. For about a century the art of these coins, at least 
as regards portraiture, ranks very high for realism and vigour. 
The Bactrian rulers seem first to have made incursions into the 
Kabul valley and north India about 200 B.C., the first Indian con- 
quests being perhaps made by Euthydemus and Demetrius. Of the 
latter there exists a bronze coin with the regular Greek types, but 
of the characteristic square Indian form, with a translation on the 
reverse into Kharoshthi characters of the obverse Greek inscription. 
Some of the coins of succeeding kings are very remarkable, as the 
tetradrachms of Antimachus (see PI. IV. fig. 5), with a portrait^ re- 
minding us of good Italian medals, and the unique 20-stater gold piece 
of Eucratides (the largest Greek gold coin known to us, although its 
genuineness has been questioned). The coinage from about 160B.0 
becomes more and more Indian, the preek power being definitely 
transferred south of the Paropanisus in the second half of the 2nd 
century. The Attic standard which had been used for the silver 
gradually gave way to the Persian. The Greek princes went on 
reigning in India to about 20 b.c. ; their chronology^ is very obscure. 
During the last two centuries B.C. several other coinages existed in 
north India. (1) The Scythic Sacae or Sakas invaded Bactria and 
then India; the earliest Saka coinage of northlndia (that of Maues 
in the Punjab, c. 120 B.C.) shows Parthian influence; so do the 
slightly later coins of Vonones and others who reigned in Kandahar 
and Seistan. (2) Another large and varied group of coins consists 
of the issues of native states, some of which go back to before 200 B.C. 
Of these we may note the coins of Eran (Sagar district) showing the 
gradual development of the punch-marked coin into the coin with a 
type, made up of a collection of such punch-symbols struck from one 
die; and the coins of Taxila, the earliest of which are struck with a 
type on one side only. From these were imitated the copper coins 
of the Greeks, Pantaleon and Agathocles (c. 190 B.C.), which again 
inspired the later coins of Taxila with types on both sides. — In the 
first century of our era the Indo- Parthian dynasty of Gondophares 
(Gundophorus of the Apocryphal Acts of St Thomas) reigned in 
Kandahar and Seistan and in India, and is represented by coins. 

About 25 B.C. the Kushanas (as the Yue-chi were called, after their 
most important tribe) conquered the remains of the Greek kingdom 
in the Kabul valley, and in the 1st century of our era they subdued 
the Punjab and the territory as far as the Jumna. The well-known 
gold coinage of the Kushanas (due probably to the influx of Roman 
gold into India) is begun by Hima Kadphises (c. a.d. 30-78; see 

[4). The best-known kings are Kanislika, Huyishka and 
Vasudeva. The types are interesting, combining deities of the 
Greeks, Scythians, the Avesta and the Vedas and Buddha. ^ The 
Greek inscriptions become meaningless after c. a.d. i 80. The coinage 
in gold (of Roman weight) and copper, however, continues probably 
as late as a.d. 425 in the Kabul valley and the Punjab. Of other 
dynasties contemporary with the Kushanas, the most important are : 
(i.) The Andhras, a south I ndian power, with territory extending across 
the peninsula from the Kistna and Godavari deltas to Kolhapur. 
The coins are chiefly of lead, but copper and silverware also known, 
(ii.) the satraps of Surashtra and Malwa. whose coinage (chiefly of 
silver) is copied irom the half-drachms of the Greek princes of the 
Punjab; it lasts until the end of the 4th century, (iii.) Earlyin 
the 4th century the important imperial Gupta coinage begins with 
Chandragupta, and continues unbroken to the death of Skandagupta, 
c. a.d. 480. The empire at its greatest extent comprised the whole of 
north India, except the Punjab. The earliest gold coinage was de- 
rived from that of the Kushanas (see PI. IV. fig. 15); later there was 
silver derived from the coinage of the satraps; the copper is more 
original in style. After c. a.d. 480 the empire broke up into various 
dynasties which lasted until a.d. 606. The Great Kushanas had been 
succeeded in Gandhara (Kabul valley and Punjab) by the Kidara 
Kushanas, and these, c. 465-470, were conquered by the Hunas (a 
branch of the Ephthalites or White Huns). The Huoa coinage 
consists almost entirely of imitations of Sassanian, Kushana or 
Gupta coins. Their power probably broke up c. a.d. 544. Of other 
ancient and medieval non-Mahommedan coinages in India the 
following may be mentioned: (1) Various series of dynasties reign- 
ing in Kanauj and Delhi, from the 7th to the 12th century. (2) 
Kashmir — coinage beginning probably as early as Kanishka and 
continuing with the same types (obverse, kinj* standing, reverse, 
goddess seated) until the Mahommedan coinage in the 13th century. 
The coins are very rude; but the succession ofthe kings from c, a.d. 
850 is fairly certain. (3) Later Shahi coinage of Gandhara, especially 
the " bull and horseman " coins (c. A.D. 860-950). (4) Pan<Jya, injthe 
extreme south : this district used first the early punch-marked coins, 
then coins with a type on one side only, and later double-type coins; 
these are earlier than c. a.d. 300. There is a later gold coinage (type, 
fish) from the 7th to 10th century. (5) Cola: an earlier coinage, 
before c. a.d. 1022, with the Cola emblem, a tiger; the later coinage 
(obverse, king standing, reverse, king seated)influenced the coinage 
over most of south India. (6) Ceylon: a coinage of the rajas imi- 
tated from the Cola coins, from a.d. 1153 to 1296. (7) Chalukya 
coinage, chiefly of gold, in west Deccan and inPallava country 
between the Kistna and Godavari; the emblem is a boar. They 
range Irom the 7th to the nth century.^ (8) Vijayanagar: this 
power preserved the old character of the coinage south of the Kistna 
long after the Mahommedan conquest had transformed the coinage 
north of that boundary. The later coinage of South India is too 
obscure to be dealt with here. 

The Arabs in the first days of conquest had subdued Sind and 
founded an independent state on the banks of the Indus, which was 
ruled by them for nearly two centuries from 711 ; but it is hard to 
subdue India from this direction, and the strangers decayed and 
disappeared. The way into India was first really opened by the 
campaigns of Mabmud of Ghazni (1 001 -1024) who annexed the 
Punjab and gave a raja to Gujarat. The Pathan kings came of the 
Ghuri stock which rose on the ruins of the empire of Ghazni (1186). 
Mohammad ibn Sam (d. 1206) made Delhi his capital, and here he 
and his successors, Pathans or slave-kings, ruled in great splendour 
as the first exclusively Mahommedan Indian dynasty, latterly 
rivalled by a line of Pathans of Bengal. Of the Pathans of Delhi 
(1206-1554) we have an abundant coinage, the principal pieces 
being the gold mohur of about 168 grains and the silver rupee of 
about the same weight, besides many pieces of bronze, and at one 
period of base metal. The coins are large and thick, with the pro- 
fession of Islam or the style of the caliph on one side, on the other the 
nameand titles of the reigning king. Mohammad ibnTughlak(i324— 
135I1 PI. IV. fig. 8) struck coins with a great variety of inscriptions, 
some in the name of the shadowy * Abbasid caliphs of Egypt, whose 
successors were for a time similarly honoured by later sovereigns. 
Towards the close of the rule of the Pathans several dynasties^ arose 
(about 1400) in central and southern India and struck similar 
money, the kings of Gujarat, of Malwa and the Bahmanids of the 
Deccan (1347-1526). The Pathan lines closed with Sher Shah, an 
Afghan, the last ruier of Bengal (d. 1539). Babar, the Turki, of the 
family of Timur, seeking a kingdom, adventured (1525) on the 
conquest of Hindustan; and after long wars with Sher Shah, carried 
on by Babar's son Humayun, the famous Shah Akbar, grandson of 
the invader, was at length peaceably settled on the throne of Delhi, 
and he and his successors, the so-called Moguls of Delhi, practically 
subdued the whole of India. They retained the existing standard, but 
used the Arabic and Persian languages like the shahs of Persia. Akbar 
(i556-i605)issuedasplendid coinage in gold and silver(Pi. £V. fig. 16), 
far more elegant than that of the Pathans, but the money of his son, 
Jahangir (i 605-1 628) is still more remarkable. He issued the famous 
zodiacal mohurs and rupees, as well as those astonishing Bacchanalian 
mohurs on which he is represented holding the wine-cup (see PI. IV. 
fig. 17). Scarcely less strange is the money of the beautiful queen 
Nur-Jahan. Under Shah Jahan (1628-1659) there is a visible falling 
away in the merit of the coins, and an ordinary modern style is reached 
in the reign of Aurungzib (1659-1707). To the close of the rule of 
Shah 'Alain, the last Mogul who actually reigned (1 759-1 806), gold 
and silver money is abundant. Much of the money of the East India 
Company is closely imitated from this late Mogul coinage. Latterly, 
native states coin with Arabic and also with Sanskrit inscriptions. 
The most important are the kings of Oudh, the nizams of the Deccan, 
and the kings of Mysore, besides the maharajas pi Indore and the 
kings of Nepal. The coinage of^ Tipu Sultan (Tippu Sahib) is ex- 
tremely curious from his innovations in the calendar. Besides these 
there are a multitude of small states. Most of the Indian princes ac- 
knowledged the emperor of Delhi, but some struck independently. 
At last the English coinage of India has swept away nearly all these 
moneys, though some native states still issue their own. 

We must be content with the briefest summary of the strange 
coinages of China and the Further East. 

The money of China, more certainly than the square punch- 
marked coinage of India, may^ claim an origin independent of the 
China Lydian and Greek issues. Although " money " is men- 

tioned in Chinese literary sources as having been in use 
from a very early period (3rd millennium B.C.) it is probable that 
before the 7th century B.C. it consisted either of uncoined metal or 
of other media, such as silk, tortoise-shell, cowries. The shell- 
currency indeed played a very important part in China even in later 
times. It was suppressed in 335 B.C., but the usurper Wang Mang, 
whose reign (a.d. O/-23) separates the two Han dynasties, made an 
abortive attempt to revive it. The earliest metal currency of which 
specimens are extant is, like nearly all subsequent Chinese money, of 
cast bronze. The gold and silver currency, which appeared sporadic- 
ally, can never have been of much importance; a km t or cubic inch, 
of gold, representing currency of Han times, is preserved in the Paris 
collection. The bronze coins fall into two main classes. The earlier 
(as a rule) have the shape of implements, such as spades, knives, 
&c. ; the later are the well-known round " cash " with a square 
hole in the centre (see PI. IV. figs. 18, 19). They are carried strung 
together, and their value is minute. From the earliest knife-money 
should be distinguished that of Wang Mang; his coins are short and 
thick, and the plain ring at the end of the handle is replaced by a 
piece resembling in shape a cash with ring and square central hole. 
The older knife-currency practically came to an end with the founda- 
tion of the Ts'in dynasty in 221 B.C., though it doubtless lingered on 
in remote districts. With this dynasty appears the first organized 
state mintage. Nevertheless the economic history of Chinese coinage 
continues to be a melancholy record of doubtful financial expedients, 
debasement and forgery. The value of the coins was supposed to 
depend on their weight; but the weight inscribed on them was by 
no means always the true one. The bronze coinage from the reform 
of Wu-ti in 138 B.C. down to A.D. 622 is fairly uniform; it is chiefly 
cash of 5 chu (see PI. IV. fig. 18). Iron money was issued at various 
periods. The disturbance of the coinage by the usurper Wang Mang 
has already been noted. The modern coinage may be said in a sense 
to date from the introduction of the K x ai yuan pattern of 7£ chu 
under the T'ang dynasty in A.D. 622. On the reverse of this coin was 
a mark (supposed to have been made by the empress Wen-teh in 
touching with her nail the wax model submitted to her) which has been 
much copied on coins of other countries in the Far East (see PI. IV. 
fig- 19)- From this time to the present there has been little change. 
Paper-money was introduced in the 9th century. The modern cash 
usually bears on the obverse the name of the reign and the words 
Vung poo (" current money ")> on the reverse the name of the mint. 
The coinage under the present (Manchu) dynasty has been regular, 
except during the Taiping rebellion, when some iron coins and copper 
tokens were issued, owing to the failure of the copper supply. Gold 
and silver have not been issued by the government until quite 
recent times (see below), with one or two unimportant exceptions, 
but circulate by weight. Imitations of Spanish and Mexican dollars, 
bearing numerous punch-marks placed on them by successive owners, 
are common. The most interesting Chinese coins are those of small 
rival dynasties and of rebels, the study of which is important for the 
elucidation of the obscurities of the history of the country. The 
Chinese medals are talismans, usually larger than coins, and bear both 
subjects and inscriptions. They are distributed by Taoist and 
Buddhist priests of temples. The money of Korea and Annam is 
similar to that of China, and Chinese coins were long the currency 
of Java, which more recently has issued the money of its Mahom- 
medan princes. 

The empire of Japan shows in its coinage that Chinese source 
modified by the influence of native independence which marks all its 
Japan. institutions. The use of a metallic currency probably 
began in the 5th century of our era. In character the 
coins show strong Chinese influence. Amongst the earliest are rude 
silver pieces, disks of somewhat irregular shape, with a central hole, 
attributed to the early 5th century ; and there are also copper coins 
of similar character dating from the end of the 7th century. A 
regular copper coinage, Chinese in pattern, began with the exploita- 
tion of the copper mines in A.D. 708. There was a silver coinage in 
a.d ; 760, and a gradually deteriorating copper currency was issued at 
various dates down to A.D. 958. The twelve varieties issued in these 
two and a half centuries are known as the twelve antique sen (see 
PI. IV. fig. 20). No copper was issued by the government for six 
hundred yeaip after this date; but coins of the old patterns in lead 
or tin circulated down to 1302. The lack of copper was supplied by 
the importation and imitation of Chinese cash. These imitations were 
due to the great nobles, who made them on their own domains. At 
the end of the 16th century (Ten-sho period) a regular currency of 
gold, silver and copper, and also iron was instituted, which lasted, 
with modifications, down to recent times (iron coins with wave- 
pattern reverse being cast as late as i860). There is a billon coinage 
of bean-shaped pieces issued at various dates from 1601-1859. 
Silver also was frequently issued on the same pattern as the copper 
coinage; but the greater part of it circulated in ingots or plates. 
The small oblong pieces known as ichi-bu and ni-bu belong to the 
19th century (not issued after 1868). Large plates of silver, like the 
gold coins to be mentioned immediately, were issued in the 16th 
century by some provinces. Round coins of gold of the Chinese shape 
were rarely cast (one in a.d. 760, another in a.d. 1599). But from 
the 1 6th century to modern times gold circulated chiefly in large 
oblong plates, with rounded angles, varying from over 6J to f in. in 
length. These are called o-ban (" large plate " of 10 ryo), ko-ban 
(" small plate " of 1 ryo; see PI. IV. fig.2i),&c. They bore various 
countermarks, including the mikado's crest, mint-assayer's test- 
marks, &c; some bear the attestations merely written in ink (a 
device of the imperial officials, who charged fees for the attestations, 
and were not sorry that they should be easily obliterated). Small 
gold oblong pieces were cast at various times from 1 601-1856 (PI. IV. 
fig. 22). A European system of currency, with coins in gold ( 20 yen 
and under), silver (1 yen and under), nickel (5 sen) and copper (2 sen 
and under), was adopted in 1870. Japan has also " picture sen " 
(E-sen) of a magical and religious character like the temple medals 
already noticed under China. 

Korea has had a copper coinage of Chinese style from the beginning 
of the twelfth century during its intervals of independence; but 
its coins do not become common until 1790. During K 
the I9th^ century it issued an extensive copper coinage orca. 
from various mints. 

r The earliest coins of Annam were imitations of Chinese coins, but 
since the 10th century its kinpjs have issued a regular coinage 
bearing their regnal titles as in China. Since 1820 round . 
and oblong silver coins have been struck, the tael and its Aanam * 
subdivisions. Peculiar to Annam are the fine series of medals in 
gold, silver and copper struck since 1841 by its kings for presentation 
purposes, bearing lucky inscriptions, quotations from the Chinese 
classics, &c. 

The peculiar forms of primitive currency characteristic of certain 
parts of Further India and the Malay Peninsula can only be barely 
mentioned here. Burma provides silver-money in the R 
shape of snail-shells (a relic of a still more primitive shell- 1 IT?"*' 
currency)^ The earlier Siamese ticals are derived from a )p^!^ y sula 
ring of silver wire doubled up and countermarked. tf n ' 
From Pahang come very curious tin " hat coins," shaped 
like a hollow square pyramid, truncated, with broad, square brim 
projecting from its base. The peoples of the Indian Ocean and 
Persian Gulf used in the 16th and 17th centuries pieces of silver wire 
called larins which in Ceylon took the shape of fish-hooks. 

V. Coins of the Present Day 

United Kingdom. — The standard of gold and silver has re- 
mained unchanged for over two hundred years, and until 1887 
the denominations were practically the same as instituted at 
the great recoinage of 1816. The substitution of a bronze for 
a copper currency had already taken place in i860. On the 
occasion of Queen Victoria's Jubilee in 1887 it was determined 
to mark the event by a new coinage of gold and silver, and to 
revise the royal portrait. Two new denominations of five and 
two pounds were added to the gold series, and the double florin 
to the silver. For the reverse type of all the gold 
and of the five-shilling piece, Pistrucci's design of 
St George and the Dragon was used, and former types 
of Anne and George IV. were revived for the double 
florin, florin, half-crown and sixpence; that of the 
last was, however, soon abandoned. This new coinage did 
not meet with general approval, especially as regards the 
portrait of the Queen, and in consequence a third portrait was 

	Fig. 1. — Sovereign (gold), England: 
	Queen Victoria (obverse by Brock). 

	Fig. 2. — Sovereign (gold), England : 
	King Edward VII. (obverse by de 
	Saulles). 

adopted for the gold and silver in 1893, new reverse types were 
prepared for the half-crown, florin and shilling, and the issue 
of the double florin was discontinued. The portrait of the queen 
was the work of the sculptor Thomas Brock, R.A., who was 
careful to avoid the defects which had been somewhat severely 
criticized in Sir J. Edgar Boehm's design of 1887. The new type 
for the half-crown, a spade-shaped shield within the garter, 
was also executed by Mr Brock; and those for the florin and 
shilling, three shields placed triangularly, were by Sir Edward 

Poynter. In 1895 a new issue of bronze money 
was ordered, when the queen's bust of 1893 was 
adopted, and a slight alteration made in the 
reverse type, the representation of a lighthouse 
and a ship, which had been added to the design 
in i860, being eliminated. 
The coinage of Edward VII. differed but slightly from that 
of Queen Victoria. The denominations were the same; but 
on the obverse the head of the king (by G. W. de Saulles, 
engraver to the Mint) was represented bare, the title " Britanni- 
arum " was changed to " Britanniarum Omnium Rex," the reverse 
of the florin showed Britannia standing *on a ship, and that 
of the shilling the royal crest, the lion on a crown, as on the 
so-called "lion-shillings" of 1826. The designing of the new 
coinage of George V. was entrusted to Mr Bertram Mackennal. 

France. — On the establishment of the Third Republic in France 
in 1870, the coinage was continued on the same lines as before, 
the types only being altered. The silver franc of 5 grammes 
(78 grains) as ordered in 1793 and confirmed by the Latin 
Monetary Union of 1865, which included Belgium, Italy and 

Switzerland, and subsequently in 1868 Greece, has remained 
the unit of value. The denominations ordered were, in 
gold, the 100, 50 and 20 francs ; in silver , the 5 , 2 
and 1 franc, and 50 and 20

	Fig. 3.— Twenty Francs (gold), centimes; and in bronze, 
	France (Chaplain).

the 10, 5, 2 and 1 centime. 

The types adopted were those 
which had been used previously — thus for the gold that 
of a genius inscribing the tables of the law, as designed 
by Augustin Dupr6 for the reverse of the constitutional 
coinage of Louis XVI.; for the silver and copper the head 
of the Republic as executed by OudinS for the money of 1848. 
Subsequently, in 1871, the type of the 5 francs was changed 
for that of Hercules leaning on Liberty and Strength, as made 
by Dupre for the First Republic. In 1889 the 10 francs in gold 
was added to the list, having the head of the Republic crowned 
with corn, the work of Merley for the Republic of 1848; but 
only a small number of these coins was struck in that year 
and in 1895. No further alteration was made till after 1895, 

when, in consequence of suggestions that the types should be 
modified so as to mark the Third Republic, the artists 
Chaplain, Roty and Dupuis were commissioned to execute 
new designs — the first for the gold, 
the second for the silver, and the last for the bronze. The 
types approved were: for the gold 20 francs, the head of 
the Republic with a Phrygian cap, and the Gallic cock; 
for the silver 2 and 1 franc and 50 centimes, the sower 
sowing, with the rising sun in the background, and a laurel 

	Fig. 4.— Two Francs (silver), France (Roty). 

branch; and for the bronze, the bust of the Republic wearing 
a Phrygian cap, and on the reverse France seated amidst clouds, 
holding a branch and a flag, and accompanied by a genius. 
These coins were not issued simultaneously — the 50 centimes 
appearing in 1897, and 2 and 1 franc and 10, 5, 2 and 1 centime 
in 1898, and the 20 francs in 1899. In 1903 a nickel piece of 
25 centimes was introduced, since 1904 with a polygonal edge 
to facilitate distinction from the silver. The quartering of the 
franc is a departure from the strictly decimal system, also adopted 
in Italy. These later coins are characteristic of modern French 
medallic art, which has a strong tendency to imitate that of 
Italy of the 16th century. 

Belgium. — Of the other states which formed the Latin 
Monetary Union, Belgium had already in 1832 adopted the 
French decimal and bimetallic system, with the franc as the unit 
of value. Her accession to the Union, therefore, only entailed 
a slight modification of type and denominations, which latter 
were the same as in France, except that the only gold coin was 
the 20 francs, the 25 centimes in silver was not issued, and the 
pieces of 10 and 5 centimes are now in nickel. The gold and 
silver coins have for types the head of the king and the royal 
shield, those in nickel the Belgic lion and mark of value, and those 
in bronze the royal monogram and the lion holding the tables 
of the constitution. Some of the silver coins have the inscriptions 
in Flemish. The nickel coinage introduced in 1902 is perforated 
in the centre to prevent confusion with silver. 

Switzerland. — Like Belgium, Switzerland had before her 
adhesion to the Latin Monetary Union adopted the French 
system, with the franc of 100 centimes or rappen as the unit of 
value. The denominations in gold and silver were the same as 
issued for Belgium, but no gold was struck before 1883. The 
coins of baser metal were the 20, 1 o and 5 centimes in 
billon, which metal was in 1879 changed for the nickel, and | 
in copper the 2 and 1 centime. Certain changes of type have 
from time to time occurred. The first issue of the 20 francs _ 
in 1883 shows the head of the FlG -5-— T ^^g^ imcs (n,ckd) J 
Republic and the shield of the 

Confederation; but this was changed in 1897 for the head of 
Helvetia above a range of mountains, and on the reverse a 
wreath with mark of value. On the silver coins from 1874 
Helvetia is represented standing instead of seated, and on the 
nickel money of 1879 the shield of the Republic is replaced by 
the head of Helvetia. The mark of value and a wreath form the 
general reverse type of all the silver, nickel and copper coins. 
Since 1888 a 5-franc piece, similar in type to the 20 francs of 
1883, has been issued. 

Italy. — When Italy joined the Latin Monetary Union in 1865, 
she adopted as the unit of her coinage the lira of 100 centesimi, 
equal to the franc. The coins were of gold, silver and bronze, 
and of the same denominations as those struck in Belgium 
and Switzerland. In 1894 a nickel coinage of 20 centesimi was 
ordered. The general type for all the coinage is the head of the 
king and the royal arms, but on the re- 
verse of the copper is the mark of value; and the nickel money 
has on the reverse a crown with a wreath. A new nickel piece 
of 25 centesimi indicates a departure from the strictly decimal 
system. The coinages of all the small Italian states, including 
the Papal, have now passed out of currency. 

Greece. — A special stipulation was made, when Greece was 
enrolled in the Latin Monetary Union in 1868, that all her money 
should be struck at a French mint. The unit of the coinage 
is the drachm of 100 lepta, which, like the lira, is equivalent 
to the franc. The denominations are — in gold, the ioo, 50, 20, 
10 and 5 drachms; in silver, the 5, 2 and 1 drachm, and 50 and 
20 lepta; and in bronze, the 10, 5, 2 and 1 lcpton. In 1893 
nickel was substituted for bronze, and coins of the value of 20, 
10 and 5 lepta were issued in this metal. The types of the coins 
of Greece are similar to those of Italy. Crete has had since 1900 
a coinage of its own similar to the Greek (silver of 5, 2 drachmae, 
1 and J drachma; bronze and nickel of 20, 10, 5, 2 lepta and 
1 lepton). 

Germany. — Since 1871 the coinage of the German empire 
has been entirely remodelled. By a convention in 1857 between 
the states of Germany, north and south, and Austria a general 
coinage of a silver standard was established on the basis of the 
new pound of 500 grammes as sanctioned by the Zollverein. The 
contracting countries were divided into three sections, North 
Germany, South Germany and Austria. From the pound of 
fine silver of 500 grammes the Northern States struck 30 thalers, 
Austria 45 florins and the Southern States $ 2 h florins; their 
relation being 1 North German thaler =1^ Austrian florins = 
1} South German florins. The free towns of Hamburg, Liibeck 
and Bremen did not join the convention. The first reform in 
the coinage of the German empire occurred in 1871, when a new 
gold money was introduced, which had for its unit the silver 
mark (a money of account) of 100 pfennigs weighing 5-555 
grammes. The new gold pieces were of the value of 10 and 20 
marks, called crowns and double crowns, and the fineness was 
■fo pure to tV alloy. This new issue necessitated a readjustment 
of the current values of the various silver coinages in circulation. 
In 1873 a further step was made by the introduction of an 
entirely new silver coinage throughout the empire, which was 
also based on the silver mark, and of a new base metal coinage 
in nickel and bronze. The silver coins were the 5, 2 and 1 mark 
and 50 and 20 pfennigs; those in nickel the 10 and 5 pfennigs, 
and in bronze the 2 and 1 pfennig. The silver coins were, like 
the gold, -fa fine, so that 00 marks were struck to the pound of 
pure metal. The gold 5 marks was struck in 1877 and 1878, 
and the 20 pfennigs in silver was replaced by a coin of the same 
value in nickel in 1886. The reverse type for all the coins is 
the imperial eagle, but that of the obverse varies; the gold and 
silver showing the portrait of the reigning king or prince, but 

the mark, and all lesser denominations, the current 
value. An exception was made in the case of the 
coinage of the Free Towns struck at Hamburg, which 
has the arms of the city instead of a portrait. Each 
state retained its full rights of coinage, and the various 
mints throughout the empire with their special marks 
are: Berlin, A; Hanover, B; Frankfort, C; Munich, D; 
Dresden (removed since 1877 to Muldner-Hutte), E; Stutt- 
gart, F; Karlsruhe, G; Darmstadt, H; and Hamburg, J. In 
1876 a gold standard was proclaimed, and henceforth no person 
was legally bound to accept in payment more than 20 marks 
in silver and the value of 1 mark in nickel or bronze. The old 
thalers (worth 3 marks) still circulate. 

Austria- Hungary. — After the convention of 1857 with Germany 
(see above), when Austria based her coinage on the silver standard 
of the florin, two series were issued — (i.) Vereinsmunzen (money 
of the union), in gold, the crown and half-crown; in silver, the 
double thaler ( = 3 florins) and thaler; (ii.) Landesmiinzen 
(money of the state), in gold, the 4 and 1 ducat; in silver, the 
double florin and florin; in billon, the 20, 10 and 5 kreuzers; 
and in copper, the 4, 3, 1 and \ kreuzer. In 1868 Austria aban- 
doned the convention, but made no change in her money; 
and in the same year the coinage of Hungary was made uniform 
with that of the empire, both in standard and denominations. 
In 1870 the Vereinsmunzen crown and half-crown were dis- 
continued, and their place was taken by 8- and 4-florin pieces 

	Fig. 7. — Twenty Marks (gold),  Germany. 

	Fig. 8. — Florin (silver), Austria-Hungary. 

which were of the current value of 20 and 10 francs. In 1892 
the monetary system of Austria-Hungary was entirely reformed 
on a gold standard, the unit of account being the crown of 100 
hellers. This is a decimal coinage, and the denominations are, 
in gold, the 20 crowns (of 164 from the kilogramme of fine gold), 
10 crowns and ducat ( = 9 silver crowns 60 hellers); in silver, 
the crown (=iod.) and half-crown; in nickel, the 20 and 10 
hellers; and in bronze, the 2 and 1 heller. The gold ducat was 
a trade-money (Handelsmiinze) of the current value of 10 francs, 
and it displaced the 8- and 4-florin pieces of 1870. The types of 
the Austrian and Hungarian coins somewhat vary. The Aus- 
trian gold coins show the head of the emperor and the two- 
headed eagle, but those of Hungary a full- 
length figure of the emperor and the national shield surmounted 
by the crown of St Stephen held by angels. The silver coins of 
both series have the head of the emperor and the mark of value 
under the imperial or royal crown. The nickel and bronze 
money of Austria displays the imperial eagle on the obverse, 
whilst that of Hungary has the crown of St Stephen. The 
legends are respectively in Latin and Magyar. 

Spain. — The unit of the Spanish coinage from 1864 to 1868 
was the silver escudo of 200 grains divisible into 10 reals. On 
the dethronement of Isabella in 1868 the provisional government 
adopted the principles of the Latin Monetary Union and made 
the peseta the unit of account, this coin being equivalent to the 
franc. The coins struck during 1869-1870 were, in gold, the 
100 pesetas; in silver, the 5, 2 and 1 peseta, and the 50 and 20 
centimos; and in bronze, the 10, 5, 2 and 1 centimo. The 
obverse type of each metal varied; on the gold Spain is standing; 
on the silver she is reeb'ning; and on the bronze she is seated. 
During his short reign (1870-1873) Amadeus I. struck only 
gold coins of 100 and 25 pesetas and silver of 5 pesetas, and 
there was practically no money issued during the republic which 
followed his abdication. Don Carlos during the insurrection 
of 1874-1875 struck 5 pesetas in silver and 10 and 5 centimos 
in bronze bearing his portrait and title " Carolus VII." After 
the restoration of Alphonso XII. the coinage consisted of 25 
and 10 pesetas in gold; 5, 2 and 1 peseta and 50 
centimos in silver; and 10 and 5 centimos in 
bronze. This coinage was continued under Alphonso 
XIII., but in 1887 the 20 pesetas in gold was sub- 
stituted for the 25 pesetas, and in 1897 large coins 
were struck of 100 pesetas 

	Fig. 9. — Peseta (silver), Spain. 

The types show the head of the 
king on the obverse and the shield with or without the pillars of 
Hercules on the reverse. 

Portugal. — A gold standard was adopted by Portugal in 
1854, the unit of value being the milreis of 1000 rcis. The coins 
are, in gold, the crown or 10 milreis and the half, fifth and tenth 
crown or milreis; in silver, the io, 5 and 2 testoon; in nickel, 
the 100 and 50 reis; and in bronze, the 20, 10 and 5 reis. The 
general type of the gold and silver is the head or bust of the 
king and the royal shield; but the bronze varies in having 
on the obverse a shield and on the reverse the mark of value. 

Denmark j Sweden and Norway.— Previous to 1872 in Denmark 
the unit of value was the silver rigsbankdaler of 96 skillings; 
in Sweden, the rigsdaler of 100 ore; and in Norway, the species- 
thaler of 120 skillings; but in that year a monetary convention 
was concluded between these countries establishing a decimal 
coinage, which had for its unit the krone of 100 8re, and of which 

	Fig. 10. — Seven and one-half 
	Roubles (gold), Russia. 

the standard was gold. The denominations are, in gold, the 
20, 10 and 5 kroner; in silver, the 2 and r krone, and 50, 25 and 
10 ore; and in bronze, the 5, 2 and 1 or. The gold and silver 
money of Sweden and Norway to the 50 ore bears the head 
of the king and the royal shield; the silver of smaller denomina- 
tions and the bronze, the monogram of the king and the mark 
of value. Since the separation of the two kingdoms in 1906, 
Norway has a coinage of its own in the name of Haakon VII. 
In Denmark the gold and silver have the head of the king, and, 
for reverse type, a figure of Denmark, a shield, or the mark 
of value. The bronze coins are similar to those of Norway and 
Sweden. 

Russia. — The Russian coinage previous to 1885 was based 
on the silver rouble of 278 grains of pure metal; but during 
the greater part of the reign of Alexander II. (1855-1881) the 
currency consisted almost entirely of paper money. In* 1885 
Alexander III. determined to place the coinage on a proper 
footing, and introduced the rouble of 100 copeks as the unit 
of account, with a relative value of gold and silver of 1 to 15 J. 
The coins issued were, in gold, the imperial of 10 roubles, and the 
half-imperial; in silver, the rouble, and the 50, 25, 20, 15, 10 
and 5 copeks; and in copper, the 5, 3, 2, 1, J and J copek. 
In 1897 the relative value of gold and silver was advanced to 

1 to 23^, thus raising the  current value of the imperial 
to 15 roubles; but no change I was made in the weights 
of the coins, and the silver rouble remained the unit of 
account. In the same year a piece of 5 roubles, called the 
one-third imperial, was added to the gold coins. The 
general types of the gold and silver, show the head of the 
emperor and the imperial eagle; and of the copper, the 
imperial eagle and mark of value. 

Georgia, Poland and Finland. — The separate issues of Georgia 
and Poland were suppressed in 1833 and 1847 respectively; 
but Finland in 1878 established a decimal coinage of gold, silver 
and bronze on the principles of the Latin Monetary Union, 
having the markkaa (=1 franc) as its unit of value. 

Turkey. — There has been practically no change in the money 
of the Ottoman empire since the reforms of Abdul-Medjid in 
1844, when the piastre, or 40-para piece, of the current value 
of 2|d., was made the unit of the coinage; 100 piastres go to 
the gold medjidieh or pound. The denominations are, in gold, 
the 500, 250, 100, 50 and 25 piastres; in silver, the 20, 10, 5, 2, 1 
and £ piastre; and in copper, the 40, 20, 10, 5 and 1 para. The 
type in all metals is, on the obverse, the Sultan's tughra, or 
cipher, and on the reverse, a wreath, and the name of the mint, 
date, &c. 

Balkan Slates. — Since the dismemberment of the Ottoman 
empire the kingdoms of Rumania and Servia, and the principality 
of Bulgaria, have each adopted the decimal system of the Latin 
Monetary Union. In Rumania the, unit of account is the leu 
of 100 bani ; in Servia, the dinar or 100 paras; and in Bulgaria, 
the lev of 100 stolinki — each of these units being the equivalent 
of the franc. In all these states gold, silver, bronze and nickel 
is current money. 

United States. — In America the most important event con- 
nected with the coinage was a change of standard. (See Money). 
Previous to 1873 the standard was silver, having for its unit the 
dollar of 41 2§ grains of •& fine; but in that year a gold standard 
was adopted, the gold dollar of 25-8 grains and i^fine being the 
sole unit of value. This change of standard was accompanied 
by a slight modification of the denominations, which became, in 
gold, the double-eagle, eagle, half and quarter eagle, three dollars 
and dollar; in silver, the half and quarter dollar, 20 cents and 
dime; in nickel, the 5 and 3 cents; and in bronze, the cent. 
In addition to these a silver piece called the " trade dollar " of 
420 grains was struck, not for circulation in the States, but for 
export to China. The following changes have since occurred: 

In 1878 the silver dollar of 41 2 J grains was resumed, and the 
20 cents discontinued; in 1887 the issue of the " trade dollar " 
was suspended; and in 1800 the same fate befell the three 
dollars and dollar in gold, and the three cents in nickel. The 
types are — gold, head of Liberty and eagle; silver, head of 
Liberty, or Liberty seated, and eagle, except the dime, which 
has the mark of value; nickel, shield (5 cents) and head of 
Liberty; bronze, head of an 'Indian, and (1910) bust of Lincoln; 
with reverse types for either metal, the mark of value. 

Canada, &c. — The currency for the Dominion of Canada, 
which includes Nova Scotia, New Brunswick and British 
Columbia, is of silver and bronze, based on the system of the 
United States. The denominations are 50, 25, 20, 10 and 5 cents 
in silver, and the cent in bronze; and they also have a uniform 
type of the sovereign's head and mark of value. The same 
system prevails in Newfoundland, which also issues the double 
dollar in gold: this is the only gold coin issued in a British 
colony whose standard is not the same as that of the 
mother country. There is a separate coinage for Jamaica, 
but of nickel only, and consisting of the penny, halfpenny and 
farthing. 

Mexico, &fc. — We need not give any detailed account of the coins 
of Mexico, and of the various states of Central and South America, in 
nearly all of which there have been radical changes since 1870. Most 
of them have adopted the decimal system, with a gold, silver or 
bi-metallic standard; the unit of value in the gold standard being 
generally the peso of 3-225 grammes, and in the silver also the peso, 
but of silver of 20, 25 or 27 grammes. 

India. — As to the coins of the East and Far East, we will limit our 
remarks to the more important countries. In British India the rupee 
of silver of 150 grains is still the unit of value. In 1893 the mints 
were closed to the unrestricted coinage of silver for the public. In 
1809 they were opened to the free coinage of gold, the sovereign 
being declared legal tender. At present £1 = 15 rupees of is. 4d.; 
1 rupee = 16 annas; I anna = 4 pice; l pice = 3 pie = i farthing. 

Persia. — In Persia since 1879 a decimal system in conformity with 
the principles of the Latin Monetary Union has been adopted, having 
for its unit the krdn weighing 78 grs., thus being equivalent to the 
franc, but since reduced to 71 grs. or even less. The denominations 
are: in gold, the 10, 5, 2, 1, J and i toman (the toman = 10 krans); 
in silver, the 5, 2 and 1 kran ( = 20 shahis), and the 10 and 5 shahis; 
and in copper, the 4, 2 and I shahi ( =2 pals), and the pal. 

Japan. — Since 1870 Japan has formed its coinage on the European 
decimal system in^ place of the ancient national coins, the obangs 
and itsibus, the unit being the yen of 100 sen. The standard was bi- 
metallic, and the relation of gold and silver stood at i-i6-i7. In 
1898 a gold standard was adopted, the issue of the silver yen was 
suspended, and the weight of the gold money was reduced by one- 
half. The coins issued since that date are, in gold, the 20, 10 and 5 
yen; in silver, the 50, 20 and 10 sen; in nickel, the 5 sen; and in 
bronze, the sen and half-sen. There is one general type for all the 
silver, nickel and bronze coins, being the dragon on the obverse and 
a wreath of flowers with mark of value on the reverse. The gold 
varies in having flags and flowers on the reverse. On the silver and 
bronze coins the legends are in English as well as in Japanese. 

China. — In 1890 China followed the example of Japan, but only 
to a limited extent, and instituted a silver coinage having as its unit 
a dollar of the same value as the United States silver dollar and the 
Japanese yen. It is calculated in fractions of the tael, a money of 
account of the value of 2s. njd. The coins are the dollar, and the 
50, 25, 10 and 5 cents, with the Chinese dragon and inscriptions, 
mint and mark of value in English on the obverse, and on the reverse 
the mark of value in Chinese and Manchu.^ They were first struck at 
Canton and Wei-Chang, but later other mints have been established. 
These are not, strictly sneaking, imperial money, the sole official 
coinage and monetary unit being the copper cash. A decree of the 
20th of November 1005 proposed to establish an official dollar on 
the basis of the Kuping tael. An edict of May 1910 provides for a 
standard currency dollar of 72 candarcens, with a subsidiary decimal 
coinage in silver, nickel and copper, for circulation throughout the 
empire. 

Korea has had since 1905 a new coinage on the Japanese system, 
but with the Korean date. 

Hong Kong. — The only other Asiatic coinage we shall note is that 
of Hong Kong, where in 1866 was established a coinage, which was 
also based on the United States standard, having the silver dollar 
as its unit. The denominations are the dollar and 50, 20 and 5 cents 
in silver, and the cent and mill in bronze; and, with the exception of 
the mill, they all have for type the sovereign's head and the mark 
of value. In connexion with this coinage there was issued in 1895 
a " trade dollar " for special currency in the Straits Settlements 
and Hong Kong in lieu of the Mexican dollar, the scarcity of which 
was a considerable hindrance of trade. This coin, which was struck 
at the Bombay mint, shows on the obverse Britannia holding a 
trident and shield, and on the reverse within an ornamental design 
the denomination in Chinese and Malay. Since 1903, however a new 

	Fig. 11. — " Trade Dollar " (silver), Hong Kong. 

special dollar with the king's head has been issued for the Straits 
Settlements. 

Egypt. — Glancing cursorily at the coinage of Africa, we may note 
that since 1885 Egypt has adopted a gold standard with the gold 
pound of 100 piastres as the unit of account. The piastre is no longer 
divisible into 40 paras, but into 10 ochr-el-guercne or tenths. The 
types arc similar to the Turkish money, and though bearing the 
legend " struck at Cairo " the coins are really made at Birmingham. 
For some years gold has not been issued. 

Abyssinia. — In Abyssinia since 1803 there has been a silver coinage, 
but the Austrian Maria Theresa dollar is still current. The new 
coins are, in silver, the talari (^dollar, worth about 2s.), £, J and j 
talari, and in copper, the guerche, and £ and J guerche. They show 
on one side the head of the king, and on the other a lion holding a 
banner. 

Zanzibar. — Zanzibar has also issued a dollar of the fixed value of 
2 rupees and 2 annas, and a copper coin called a pessa (- 136th 
of a dollar). 

Sudan. — The African coinages which have attracted exceptional 
attention arc those of the Sudan and the South African Republic. 
The former dates from 1885, when the Mahdi struck the pound of 
100 piastres in gold and the 20 piastres in silver, of the same type as 
the Egyptian coins, but on the silver piece were placed the words 
" By order of the Mahdi,'* but no mint name. His successor, 
Abdullah, struck pieces of 20, 10, 5, 2 and 1 piastre in silver and 10 
paras in copper, but no gold. They bear the name of the mint, 
Omdurman, and the word makbul, t.e. accepted. At first the silver 
coins were of 6 parts silver and 2 copper, but in a few years they 
were so debased that they degenerated into mere pieces of copper 
washed with silver. The last issue is dated 1897 (a.h. 13 15). 

Congo Free State (Belgian Congo). — The coinage issued since 1887 
consists of silver of 5, 2, 1 fr. and 50 centimes, and copper (with 
central hole) from 10 centimes to 1 centime. 

Transvaal. — The first attempt at a separate coinage in the Trans- 
vaal was in 1874, when President Burgers issued sovereigns or 
pounds showing his portrait on the obverse and the shield of the 
Republic on the reverse. They were struck by Messrs Heaton of 
Birmingham, but as each piece of the current value of 20s. cost 26s. 
to strike, only £680 worth was issued, and but few of these passed 
into circulation, being preserved as curiosities. No further attempt 
was made till 1891, when President Kruger induced the Raad to 
order a coinage in gold, silver and bronze after the English standard. 
The first issue occurred in 1892, and consisted of the pound and half- 
pound in gold; the crown, half-crown, florin, shilling, sixpence and 
threepence in silver; and the penny in bronze. They are all of the 
same type as the pound of 1874, but with the portrait of President 
Kruger on the obverse. The first issue of the pound, half-pound and 
crown was minted at Berlin, and a curious mistake was made in the 
arms of the^ state, the^ wagon being represented with two shafts 
instead of with one. This blunder was soon noticed, and a recoinage 
took place in the same year at Pretoria. Since the annexation 
British coins have been legal tender, but a new copper coinage was 
approved in 1904.

NUMMULITE, NUMMULITES, A. d'Orbigny's name for a 
genus of Perforate Foraminifera (q.v.), distinguished by the 
flattened, lenticular discoid shell of many turns, finely perforated ; 
chambers subdivided by incomplete septa into squarish chamber- 
lets. This genus is especially abundant in Eocene Limestones, 
which attain great thickness around the Mediterranean basin; 
the Pyramids of Egypt are built of it. 


NUN (O. Eng. nunne, from Lat. nonnus, nonna, familiar terms 
for an old man or woman), a member of a community of women, 
living under vows a lif e of religious observance (see M onastjcjsm) . 
In ecclesiastical Latin nonnus was used by the younger members 
of a religious community for their elders, and so, in the regula 
of St Benedict, cap. 62, Juniores autem Prior es suos nonnos 
vocanl quod intelligitur paterna reverentia (Du Cange, Glossarium, 
s.v. nonnus). While nonna has remained as the generic name 
of a female religious, nonnus has been replaced by monachus 
and its various derivatives (see Monk) . 


NUNATAK, a name applied in Greenland (and thence extended 
in use elsewhere) to a hill or mountain peak appearing above 
the surface of a glacier. Greenland is for the most part covered 
by an ice-cap of a certain thickness which moves slowly down- 
wards to the sea. It will rise upwards and pass over a barrier 
if there is no outlet, but it will flow between and around mountain 
peaks leaving them standing as hills (nunataks) above the 
general surface of the ice-cap. These prominences are sometimes 
covered with arctic vegetation, and arctic flowers bloom freely 
upon them in the summer. 


NUNCIO, or Nuntius Apostolicus, a representative of the 
pope sent on diplomatic mission. The nuncios are of lower 
rank than the legati a latere, but have practically superseded 
them as ambassadors of the papacy. Nuncios were permanently 
established at various courts and ecclesiastical centres during 
the 16th century. According to the decision of the congress of 
Vienna the diplomatic rank of a papal nuncio corresponds to 
that of an ambassador. The powers of a nuncio are limited 
by his instructions. If a cardinal, as rarely is the case, he uses 
the title pro-nuntius. The pro-nuntius at Vienna has practically 
the position of a legatus a latere. 


NUNCOMAR or Nanda kumar (d. 1775), Indian official, best 
known for his connexion with Warren Hastings {q.v.), was 
governor of Hugli in 1756, and in 1764 he was appointed collector 
of Burdwan in place of Hastings, which resulted in a long-stand- 
ing enmity. In 1775, when Hastings was governor-general, 
Nuncomar brought accusations of peculation against him, 
which were entertained by Francis and the other members of 
council inimical to Hastings. While the matter was still pending 
Nuncomar was indicted for forgery, condemned and executed. 
Warren Hastings and Sir Elijah Impey, the chief justice, were 
both impeached, and were accused by Burke and afterwards 
by Macaulay of committing a judicial murder; but Sir James 
Stephen, who examined the trial in detail, states that the indict- 
ment for forgery arose in the ordinary course, was not brought 
forward by Hastings, and that Impey conducted the trial with 
fairness and impartiality. 

See Sir James Stephen, The Story of Nuncomar (2 vols., 1885); 
and, for another treatment of the case, H. Beveridge, The Trial of 
Nanda Kumar (Calcutta, 1886). 


NUNEATON, a market town and municipal borough in the 
Nuneaton parliamentary division of Warwickshire, England, 
on the river Anker, a tributary of the Tame, and on the Coventry 
canal. It is an important junction of the London and North 
Western railway, by which it is 97 m. N.W. from London, and 
it is served by the Leicester-Birmingham branch of the Midland 
railway. Pop. (1901) 24,996, rapidly increasing. The situation 
is low and almost encircled by rising ground. The church of 
St Nicholas is a large and handsome structure in various styles of 
architecture, and consists of nave, chancel and aisles, with a 
square embattled tower having pinnacles at the angles. It 
contains several interesting monuments. A free grammar school 
was founded in the reign of Edward VI., and an English free 
school for the instruction of forty boys and thirty girls by Richard 
Smith in 1712. The ribbon industry. is of less importance than 
formerly, but there are ironworks, cotton, hat, elastic and 
worsted factories, and tanneries; the making of drain-pipes, 
tiles and blue and red bricks is a considerable industry. In the 
neighbourhood there are also coal and ironstone mines. The 
prefix of the name of the town is derived from a priory of nuns 
founded here in 11 50. In the reign of Henry III. a weekly 
market was granted to the prioress. Nuneaton was incorporated 
in 1907, and the corporation consists of a mayor, six aldermen 
and twelve councillors. Area 10,597 acres. 


NUNEZ, PEDRO (Petrus Nonius) (1492-1577), Portuguese 
mathematician and geographer, was born at Alcacer do Sal, 
and died at Coimbra, where he was professor of mathematics. 
He published several works, including a copiously-annotated 
translation of portions of Ptolemy (1537), and a treatise in two 
books, De arte atque rations navigandi (1546). His clear state- 
ment of the scientific equipment of the early Portuguese explorers 
has become famous. A complete edition of all his writings 
appeared at Basel in 1592.

progresses das mathematicas em Portugat (Paris, 1819); R. H. Major,

NUSfEZ CABEZA DE VACA, ALVARO (c. 1490 -*. 1564), 
Spanish explorer, was the lieu tenant of Pamfilo de Narvaez 
in the expedition which sailed from Spain in 1527; when 
Narvaez was lost in the Gulf of Mexico, Cabeza de Vaca succeeded 
in reaching the mainland somewhere to the west of the mouths 
of the Mississippi, and, striking inland with three companions, 
succeeded, after long wandering and incredible hardship, in 
reaching the city of Mexico in 1536. Returning to Spain in 1537, 
he was appointed " adelantado " or administrator of the province 
of Rio de la Plata in 1 540. Sailing from Cadiz in the end of that 
year, after touching at Cananea (Brazil), he landed at the island 
of St Catharine in the end of March 1541. Leaving his ships 
to proceed to Buenos Aires, he set out in November with about 
150 men to find his way overland to Ascension (Asuncion) for 
the relief of his countrymen there. The little band reached 
their destination in the following year. After various successes 
in war and diplomacy in his dealings with the Indians, Nunez 
was sent home under arrest in 1544, and in 1551 was banished 
to Africa by the council of the Indies for eight years. He was 
recalled in about a year and appointed to a judgeship in Seville, 
where he died not later than 1 564. 

The Naufragios (" Shipwrecks ") of Cabeza de Vaca, which relate 
to the Florida expedition arid his journey to the city of Mexico, 
appeared at Zamora in 1 542 ; the work has frequently been 
reprinted, and an annotated English translation was published by 
T. Buckingham Smith in 1S51. His Cotnentarios (1555) chronicle 
the events of the South American expedition. See Fanny Bandelier, 
Journey of A. Nunez Cabeza de Vaca (ed. A. F. Bandelier, New York, 
1905). 


NUStEZ DE ARCE, GASPAR (1834-1903), Spanish poet, 
dramatist and statesman, was born at Valladolid, where he was 
educated for the priesthood. He had no vocation for the 
ecclesiastical state, plunged into literature, and produced a play 
entitled Amor y Orgullo which was acted at Toledo in 1849. 
To the displeasure of his father, an official in the post office, 
the youth refused to enter the seminary, and escaped to Madrid, 
where he obtained employment on the staff of El Observador, 
a Liberal newspaper. He afterwards founded El Bachiller 
Honduras, a journal in which he advocated a policy of Liberal 
concentration, and he attracted sufficient notice to justify his 
appointment as governor of Logrono, and his nomination as 
deputy for Valladolid in 1865. He was imprisoned at Caceres 
for his violent attacks on the reactionary ministry of Narvaez, 
acted as secretary to the revolutionary Junta of Catalonia when 
Isabella was dethroned, and wrote the " Manifesto to the Nation " 
published by the provisional government on the 26th of October 
1868. During the next few years he practically withdrew from 
political life till the restoration, when he attached himself to 
Sagasta's party. He served under Sagas ta as minister for the 
colonies, the interior, the exchequer and education; but ill- 
health compelled him to resign on the 27th of July 1890, and 
henceforth he refused to take office again. He was elected to 
the Spanish Academy on the 8th of January 1874 and was 
appointed a life-senator in 1886. He died at Madrid on the 
12th of February 1903. 

Nunez de Arce first came into notice as a dramatist, and he 
remained faithful to the stage for nearly a quarter of a century. 
In addition to three plays written in collaboration with Antonio 
Hurtado, he produced IQuUn es el autor? (1859), La Cuenta del 
Zapatero (1859), iComo se empena un mar idol (i860), Dendas 
de la honra (1863), Ni tanto ni tan poco (1865), Quien debe f paga 
(1867) and El haz de Una (1872). But Nunez de Arce's talent 
was more lyrical than dramatic, and his celebrity dates from the 
appearance of Gritos del combate (1875), a collection of poems 
exhorting Spaniards to lay aside domestic quarrels and to save 
their country from anarchy, more dangerous than a foreign foe. 
He maintained his position (in popular esteem) as the only possible 
rival of Campoamor by a series of philosophic,elegiac and symbolic 
poems: — Raimundo Lulio, Ultima lamentacidn de Lord Byron 
(1879), Un Idilio y una Elegia (1879), La Selva oscxtra (1879) 
and La Visidn de Fray Martin (1880). The old brilliance sets 
off the naturalistic observation of La Pesca (1884) and La 
Maruja (1886). Thelistof his works is completed by Poetnas cortos 
(1895) and ISursum corda! (1900); Herndn el lobo y published 
in El Liberal (January 23, 1881) and Luzbel remain unfinished. 
His strength lies in the graciousness of his vision, his sincerity 
and command of his instrument; his weakness derives from his 
divided sympathies, his moods of obvious sentiment and his 
rhetorical facility. But at his best, as in the Gritos del combate t 
he is a master of virile music and patriotic doctrine. (J. F.-K.) 

NUORO, a town and episcopal see of Sardinia, Italy, in the 
province of Sassari, 38% m. E. of Macomer by rail. Pop. (1901) 
6739. It is situated 1005 ft. above sea-level in the east central 
portion of the island, amid fine scenery. Nuoro was the capital 
of a province from 1848 to i860. It is connected by road with 
Fonni, Bitti and Orosei. An inscription discovered in situ 
about 13 m. \V. of Nuoro in 1889, near Orotelli, has the letters 
FIN NVRR (fin(es)Nurr. . . ), which are explained as referring 
to the boundaries of the territory of Nuoro in Roman times, 
showing (what was not known before) that the name and the 
place are of Roman origin (F. Vivanet in Notizie degli scavi, 
1889, 202). (T. As.) 


NUPE, formerly an independent state of W. Africa, now a 
province in the British protectorate of Nigeria. Under Fula rule, 
Nupe occupied both banks of the Niger for a distance of some 
1 50 m. above the Benue confluence. Only the part of Nupe north 
of the Niger now constitutes the province; area 6400 sq. m.; 
estimated pop. about 150,000. It is in many portions highly 
cultivated, and owing to its admirable water supply is likely to 
prove particularly valuable as a field for the extensive cultivation 
of cotton. Bida (q.v,) } the capital, is connected by railway (built 
1 907-1 908) with Baro, a port on the Niger 70 m. above Lokoja. 

Nupe had an ancient and very interesting constitution of 
which the leading features were adopted by the Fula when their 
rule was established about the year 1859. Bida was founded 
in that year. Nupe was conquered by the troops of the Niger 
Company in 1897, and the legal status of slavery was then 
nominally abolished. The company was, however, unable to 
occupy the country, and on the withdrawal of its troops the 
deposed emir returned. In 1901 it became necessary to subdue 
Nupe a second time. British troops marched to Bida. The 
emir fled without fighting and was deposed. Another emir 
was appointed in his place, took the oath of allegiance to the 
British crown, and worked cordially with the British resident 
who was stationed at Bida. The province is divided into three 
administrative districts — Bida, Lapai and Agaie. These are agai n 
divided into nine native districts, five to the west and four to 
the east of the Kaduna river. Provincial courts of justice have 
been established. 

See Nigeria, Bida. For an interesting account of the ancient 
constitution of Nupe see " The Fulani Emirates of Northern Nigeria," 
by Major J. A. Burdon in the Geo Journ. y vol. xxiv (London, 1904). 


NUREMBERG (Ger. Niirnberg), a city of Germany, the second 
town in Bavaria in size, and the first in commercial importance. 
It lies in the district of Middle Franconia in a sandy but well- 
cultivated plain, 124 m. by rail N.W. from Munich. The city 
is divided by the small river Pegnitz, a tributary of the Main, 
into two parts, called respectively the Lorenzer Seite and the 
Sebalder Seite, after the two principal churches. There are 
four islands in the Pegnitz, which is crossed here by fourteen 
bridges. Formerly among the richest and most influential of 
the free imperial towns, Nuremberg is one of the few cities of 
Europe that have retained their medieval aspect largely un- 
impaired. Considerable sections of the ancient walls and moat 
* still remain, though the demolition of portions to meet the 
exigencies of modern traffic and expansion has somewhat 
destroyed its quaint medieval character. Of the 365 bastions 
which formerly strengthened the walls, however, nearly 100 
are still in situ y and a few of the interesting old gateways have 
also been preserved. Most of the streets are narrow and crooked, 
and the majority of the houses have their gables turned towards 
the street. The general type of architecture is Gothic, but the 
rich details, which are lavished with especial freedom in the 
interior courts, are usually borrowed from the Renaissance. 
Most of the private dwellings date from the 16th century, and 
there are practically none of earlier date than the 15th century. 
A praiseworthy desire to maintain the picturesqueness of the 
town has led most of the builders of new houses to imitate the 
,lofty peaked gables, oriel windows and red-tiled roofs of the 
older dwellings. Altogether Nuremberg presents a faithful 
picture of a prosperous town of three hundred years ago. 

The old burg, or castle (Kaiserschloss) , is picturesquely 
placed on a rock on the north side of the town. This dates 
most probably from the early part of the nth century, but it 
received its present form mainly during the reign of the emperor 
Frederick I. about 150 years later. It was restored in careful 
harmony with its original appearance in 1854-1856, and part 
of the interior is fitted up as a royal residence, the families of 
the German emperor and of the king of Bavaria having apart- 
ments therein. In the Heidenturm are two late Romanesque 
chapels, one above the other. Other parts of the castle are the 
pentagonal tower, the oldest building in the town, wherein are 
preserved the famous " iron virgin of Nuremberg," and other 
instruments of torture; the granary (Kornhaus), also called 
the Kaiserstallung; and the Vestnertor or Vestnerturm. The 
castle of Nuremberg was a favourite residence of the German 
sovereigns in the later middle ages, and 'the imperial regalia 
were kept here from 1424 to 1796. Near it are the remains of 
the burg of the Hohenzollerns, the principal existing part of 
which is the chapel of St Walpurgis, which was destroyed with 
the rest of the building in 1420, but was restored in 1892. Not 
far from these ruins stands the Luginsland, a stronghold with 
four corner turrets, said to have been built by the burghers in 
1367 as a watch-tower against the burg of the Hohenzollerns. 

Nuremberg contains several interesting churches, the finest 
of which are those of St Lorenz, of St Sebald and of Our Lady. 
All three are Gothic edifices and are notable for their elaborately 
carved doorways, in which free play has been given to the 
exuberant fancy of the Gothic style, and all three enshrine 
valuable treasures of art. The Church of St Lawrence, the 
largest of the three, was built in the 13th and 14th centuries 
and has recently been restored. In it is the masterpiece of the 
sculptor, Adam Krafft, consisting of a ciborium, or receptacle 
for the host, in the form of a florid Gothic spire 65 ft. high; 
the carving of this work is exquisitely minute and delicate. The 
west front contains a magnificent rose-window, and some of 
the stained glass dates from the 15th and 16th centuries. In 
front of the altar hangs a curious piece of wood-carving by Veit 
Stoss, representing the Salutation. The shrine of St Sebald, 
in the church of St Sebald, consisting of a bronze sarcophagus 
and canopy, in the richest Gothic style, adorned with numerous 
statues and reliefs, is looked upon' as one of the greatest achieve- 
ments of German art. It was executed by Peter Vischer, the 
celebrated artist in bronze, who was occupied on the work 
for thirteen years (1 506-1519), and has here shown himself 
no unworthy rival of Lorenzo Ghiberti. The church of Our 
Lady possesses some fine old stained-glass windows and some 
paintings by Michael Wohlgemuth. The Tuchersche altar, with 
its winged picture, is one of the finest works of the Nuremberg 
school about the middle of the 15th century. This church was 
restored in 1878-1881. Other noteworthy churches are those 
of St Jacob, founded about 1200 and restored in 1824; and of 
St Aegidius. 

The town hall (Rathaus), an edifice in the Italian style, 
erected in 1616-1619, contains frescoes by Diirer, and a curious 
stucco relief of a tournament held at Nuremberg in 1446. The 
building incorporated an older one of the 14th century, of which 
the great hall, with its timber roof, is part. The most interesting 
secular buildings are the houses of the old patrician families. 
Among the most characteristic of these are the old residence of 
the counts of Nassau, and the houses of the Tucher, Funk and 
Peller families. A special interest attaches to the dwellings of 
Albert Diirer, Hans Sachs, the cobbler-poet, and Johann Palm, 
the patriotic bookseller who was shot by order of Napoleon 
in 1806. There are statues of Diirer, Sachs, Melanchthon, the 
reputed founder of the grammar-school, the navigator Martin 
Behaim, and Peter Henlein, the inventor of the watch; and 
the streets are further embellished with several fountains, the 
most noteworthy of which are the Schone Brunnen, 1385-1396, 
in the form of a large Gothic pyramid, adorned with statues 
of the seven electors, the " nine worthies," and Moses and the 
prophets; and the Gansemannchen or goose-mannikin, a clever 
little bronze figure by Pankratz Labenwolf . On the way to the 
cemetery of St John, which contains the graves of Diirer, Sachs, 
Behaim and other Nuremberg worthies, are Kraift's stations, 
seven pillars bearing stone reliefs of the Passion, and ranked 
among the finest works of the sculptor. 

The Germanic national museum, established in an old Car- 
thusian monastery, has developed into one of the largest and 
most important institutions of its kind in Germany. It includes 
a picture-gallery, principally of German works of the 15th and 
16th centuries, including masterpieces by Holbein, Diirer, 
Wohlgemuth and others. The municipal library contains about 
2000 manuscripts and 80,000 printed books, some of which are 
of great rarity. 

The population of Nuremberg was, in 1905, including a 
'garrison of about 3000 men, 294,344, of whom 145,354 were males 
and 148,990 females. Of these again 196,907 were Protestants 
(Evangelical), 86,939 Roman Catholics and 6819 Jews. At the 
height of its prosperity in the middle ages the population has 
been estimated at as high a figure as 150,000, but there seems good 
reason to believe that it did not exceed 40,000 to 50,000 souls. 
In 1818 it had sunk to 27,000, but since then has steadily 
increased. On the 1st of January 1899, thirteen outlying 
communes were incorporated, extending the area of the town 
from 2805 to 13,700 acres. 

Nuremberg occupies a high place among the industrial and 
commercial centres of Europe. The principal manufactures 
are toys and fancy articles in metal, carved wood and ivory, 
which are collectively known as Nuremberg wares. Nuremberg 
is the chief market in Europe for hops. It is an important 
junction for railways to all parts of Germany, and is on the 
main line from Cologne and Frankfort-on-Main to Munich, 
Vienna and Eger. In addition to its railways, trade is facilitated 
by the Ludwig canal, connecting the Danube and the Main. 

History. — The first authentic mention of Nuremberg, which 
seems to have been called into existence by the foundation of the 
castle, occurs in a document of 1050; and about the same period 
it received from the emperor Henry III. permission to establish 
a mint and a maiket. It is said to have been destroyed by the 
emperor Henry V. in 1105, but if this was the case the town must 
have been very speedily rebuilt, as in 11 27 we find the emperor 
Lothair taking it from the duke of Swabia and assigning it to 
Henry the Proud, duke of Bavaria. An imperial officer, styled 
the burggrave of Nuremberg, who, however, seems to have been 
merely the military governor of the castle, and to have exercised 
no sway over the citizens, became prominent in the 12th century. 
This office came into the hands of the counts of Hohenzollem at 
the beginning of the 13th century, and burggrave of Nuremberg 
is still one of the titles of their descendant, the German emperor. 
The government of the town was vested in the patrician families, 
who, contrary to the usual course of events in the free towns, 
succeeded in permanently excluding the civic gilds from all 
share of municipal power, although in 1347 there was a sharp 
rising against this oligarchy. The town was specially favoured 
by the German monarchs, who frequently resided and held diets 
here, and in 1219 Frederick II. conferred upon it the rights of a 
free imperial town. By the terms of this charter the town 
appears to have been immediately subject to the king, who was 
represented by his magistrate (or Schtdtheiss). In a short time, 
however, the latter appears to have been assisted by a council, 
consisting of 13 consoles (burgomasters) and 13 scabini (assessors), 
who collectively formed the governing and administrative body 
under the presidency of the bailiff. The last-named official 
soon confined himself to the judicial magisterial office, and a 
further increase in the numbers of the council having taken place 
by the appointment of 8 nominees of the king, a municipal council 
of 34, under the direction of the senior consul or burgomaster, 
dealt with matters exclusively civic. Later this council (the 
kleine Rat) was increased to 42 members, 8 of whom belonged 
to the artisan class. 

In 1356 Nuremberg witnessed the promulgation of the famous 
Golden Bull of the emperor Charles IV. At the beginning of the 
15th century the burggraves of Nuremberg, who had in the 
meantime raised themselves to the rank of princes of the Empire, 
were invested with the margraviate of Brandenburg, and sold 
their castle to the town. They, however, reserved certain rights, 
and their insistence on these led to fierce and sanguinary feuds 
between the burghers and the margraves Albert Achilles and 
Frederick and Albert Alcibiades of Bayreuth. 

The quarrel with the margraves, however, did not interfere 
with the growth of the town's prosperity, which reached its acme 
in the 16th century. Like Augsburg, Nuremberg attained 
great wealth as an intermediary between Italy and the East 
on the one hand, and northern Europe on the other. Its manu- 
factures were so well known that it passed into a proverb — 
" Nuremberg's hand goes through every land." Its citizens 
lived in such luxury that Aeneas Sylvius (Pope Pius II.) has 
left it on record that a simple burgher of Nuremberg was better 
lodged than the king of Scotland. The town had gradually 
extended its sway over a territory nearly 500 sq. m. in extent, 
and was able to furnish the emperor Maximilian with a contingent 
of 6000 troops. But perhaps the great glory of Nuremberg lies 
in its claim to be the principal fount of German art. Its important 
architectural features have already been described. The love 
of its citizens for sculpture is abundantly manifest in the statues 
and carvings on their houses. Adam Krafft, Veit Stoss and Peter 
Vischer form a trinity of sculptors of which any city might be 
proud. In painting Nuremberg is not less prominent, as the 
names of Wohlgemuth and Diirer sufficiently indicate. In the 
decorative arts the Nuremberg handicraftsman attained great 
perfection in ministering to the luxurious tastes of the burghers, 
and a large proportion of the old German furniture, silver-plate, 
stoves and the like, which are now admired in industrial museums, 
was made in Nuremberg workshops. Wenzel Jamnitzer (1 508- 
1585), the worker in silver, is perhaps eminent enough to be added 
to the above list of artists. Its place in literary history — by 
no means an unimportant one — it owes to Hans Sachs and the 
other meistersanger. A final proof of its vigorous vitality at 
this period may be found in the numerous inventions of its 
inhabitants, which include watches, at first called " Nuremberg 
eggs," the air-gun, gun-locks, the terrestrial and celestial globes, 
the composition now called brass, and the art of wire-drawing. 

Nuremberg was the first of the imperial towns to throw in its 
lot with the Reformation, and it embraced Protestantism with 
its wonted vigour about 1525. Its' name is associated with a 
peace concluded between Charles V. and the Protestants in 1532. 
The first blow to its prosperity was the discovery of the sea-route* 
to India in 1497; and the second was inflicted by the Thirty 
Years' War, during which Gustavus Adolphus was besieged here 
in an entrenched camp by Wallenstein. During the eight or ten 
weeks that the blockade lasted no fewer than 10,000 of the 
inhabitants are said to have died of want or disease. The down- 
fall of the town was accelerated by the illiberal policy of its 
patrician rulers; and the French Revolution reduced it to such 
a degree that in 1796 it offered itself and its territories to the 
king of Prussia on condition that he would pay its debts. 
Prussia, however, refused the offer. In 1803 Nuremberg was 
allowed to maintain its nominal position as a free city, but in 
1806 it was annexed to Bavaria.

NURSE (a shortened form of the earlier " nourice," adapted 
through the French from Lat. nutrix, nutrire, to nourish), 
primarily a woman who suckles and takes care of an infant, 
and more generally one who has the general charge of children; 
also a person, male or female, who attends to the sick, and 
particularly one who has been trained professionally for that 
purpose (see Nursing). 


NURSING. The development of sick-nursing, which has 
brought into existence a large, highly-skilled, and organised 
profession, is one of the most notable features of 
modern social life. The evolution of the sick-nurse is 
mainly due to three very diverse influences — religion, war and 
science — to name them in chronological order. It was religion 
which first induced ladies, in the earlier centuries of Christianity, 
to take up the care of the sick as a charitable duty. The earliest 
forerunner of the great sisterhood of nurses of whom we have 
any record was Fabiola, a patrician Roman lady, who in a.d. 380 
founded a hospital in Rome with a convalescent home attached, 
and devoted herself and her fortune to the care of the sick poor. 
She had a rival in the empress Flaccilla, the pious consort of 
Theodosius I. (a.d. 370-395), who also personally visited the 
hospitals and attended on the sick. Organized nursing does 
not appear to have formed any part of medical treatment, 
except in so far as the deacons of the church attended on the 
poor, until the 4th century of the Christian era. After that date 
the employment of women for this purpose must have developed 
rapidly, for in the reign of Honorius (a.d. 395-423) six hundred 
women were engaged in the hospitals of Alexandria. These 
institutions were managed by the clergy, and throughout the 
dark and middle ages the hospital and nursing systems were 
connected with religious bodies. Nurses were provided by the 
male and female monastic orders, an arrangement which still 
continues in most Roman Catholic countries, though it is gradu- 
ally being abandoned through the increasing demands of medical 
science, which have led the hospitals to establish training schools 
of their own. The names of the oldest foundations which still 
survive, such as the H6tel Dieu in Paris, St Thomas's and 
St Bartholomew's in London, the order of St Augustine, and 
(in the form of a modern revival) that of St John of Jerusalem, 
sufficiently indicate the original religious connexion. The 
order of St Vincent de Paul, founded in 1633 for the express 
purpose, is still the largest nursing organization in the world. 
Even in Protestant England, where purely secular training 
schools have reached their highest development, the generic 
title of Sister, alike prized by its holders and honoured by the 
public, remains the popular and professional synonym for head 
nurse, and perpetuates the old association. Nursing, as a 
popular or fashionable occupation, is not a modern invention. 
,Sir Henry Burdett quotes an order," dated 30th May 1578, 
directing the master and the prior of the Hotel Dieu "not to 
receive henceforth any novices without speaking of it to the 
company, because there are an excessive number of nuns and 
novices, who cause great expense to the said Hotel Dieu." 
In Protestant countries a secular nursing system came in with 
the Reformation. The staff appointed for St Bartholomew's, 
on its re-establishment by Henry VIII. in 1544, consisted of a 
matron and twelve nurses, who were engaged in domestic 
occupations when off duty. Thus nursing became a menial 
office and an inferior means of livelihood, adopted by women 
of the lower orders without any training or special skill; and 
so it continued down to the middle of the 19th century, when 
a new movement began which was destined to revolutionize the 
status of the nurse. 

Its distinctive feature was the systematic training of nurses for 
their vocation. Previously a certain amount of regular instruc- 
tion had no doubt been given here and there by individual 
physicians and surgeons; lectures to nurses were delivered in the 
New York Hospital as early as 1790. But these were isolated 
efforts. Such skill as nurses possessed was picked up in the wards. 
No qualifications were required, nor indeed would they have 
been forthcoming, so low had the calling sunk in public estima- 
tion. The credit of inaugurating the new order of things belongs 
to Germany, and here again the religious influence came into play. 
The beginning of the modern system dates from the foundation 
of the institute for training deaconesses at Kaiserswerth by 
Pastor Fliedner in 1836. It is true that state training schools 
for male nurses had previously existed in Prussia, the oldest 
having been founded at Magdeburg in 1799; but the employment 
of men in hospital wards is a feature of the German system which 
has not been copied by other advanced countries, and seems 
to be in process of abandonment in Germany. It is a heritage 
from the middle ages,- when the Knights Hospitallers undertook 
for men the duties discharged in female institutions by the nuns. 
The male schools, therefore, stand somewhat apart, though they 
mark a stage in the evolution of nursing as the earliest regular 
training establishments. * The Kaiserswerth Institute, on the 
contrary, had a far-reaching and lasting influence, and may 
fairly claim to be the mother of the modern system. England, 
in particular, owes much to it, for there Florence Nightingale 
acquired the practical knowledge which enabled her afterwards 
to turn her remarkable gift of organization to such brilliant 
account. The example of Kaiserswerth was soon followed, and 
not in Germany only. In 1838 the Society of Friends founded 
a nursing organization in Philadelphia, and in 1840 Mrs Fry, a 
member of the same community, started the Institution of 
Nursing Sisters in London. In 1857 the nurses attached to it 
numbered ninety. They received their practical training at 
Guy's and St Thomas's Hospitals. On the continent institutes 
for nursing deaconesses were founded at Strassburg, Utrecht, 
Berlin, Breslau, Konigsberg and Carlsruhe between 1842 and 
1851. In London a Church of England ■ training institution 
(St John's House) was opened in 1848. There were three classes 
— (1) sisters, (2) probationers, (3) nurses. The nursing at King's 
College Hospital was for many years undertaken by this society, 
whose members were trained at the hospital. 

The training system, thus inaugurated on a semi-religious 
basis, received a new impetus from the Crimean War, which 
was further emphasized by the Civil War in America and the 
subsequent great conflicts on the continent. The despatch of 
Florence Nightingale with a staff of trained nurses, to super- 
intend the administration of the military hospitals was the 
direct result of the publicity given to the details of the Crimean 
War by The Times, and it formed a new departure which riveted 
the eyes of the civilized world. The work undertaken and 
accomplished by this lady was far more important than the mere 
nursing of sick and wounded soldiers. She had grasped the 
principles of hygiene, which were then beginning to be under- 
stood, and she applied them to the reform of the hospital 
administration. In civil life it had a marked effect in stimulating 
the training movement and raising the status of the nurse; 
but substantial results were only obtained by degrees. It was 
not until (1^60 that the modern hospital school system was 
definitely inaugurated by the opening of the Nightingale Fund 
School at St Thomas's Hospital, founded with the money sub- 
scribed by the British public in recognition of Miss Nightingale's 
national services, and worked on principles laid down by her. 
In the meantime several nursing societies, in addition to those 
previously mentioned, had been founded in England, and else- 
where. Among them the Baden Ladies' Society, founded in 
1859 by the Grand Duchess Luise, deserves mention. In the 
same year the first district nurse began work in Liverpool; 
and in 1865 the reform of the much-neglected workhouse nursing 
was inaugurated by Miss Agnes Jones and twelve nurses from 
St Thomas's, who took up the work in Liverpool. At this time 
England took a decided lead, which she has never lost. Other 
countries gradually followed. In Germany the Albert Nursing 
Society was founded by Queen Carola ef Saxony, and the Alice 
Society by the Grand Duchess Alice of Hesse, both in 1867. 
In France, where the nursing was comparatively well performed 
by the religious orders, no change was made until 1877, when 
a training school was opened in Paris by the municipality, 
and two others by the Assistance Publique, in connexion with 
the Salpetriere and Bicetre Hospitals. In the United States 
schools were opened in New York, New Haven and Boston in 
1873. The B ritish colonies, Austria, and other European 
countries followed some years later. 

It remained for the third influence to complete the work begun 
and to develop systematic nursing to its present dimensions. 
Since 1880 the increasing demands of medical knowledge have 
well-nigh revolutionized the craft in the home, the hospital 
and the workhouse. A large part of the change may be summed 
up in the words " scientific cleanliness." The outcome has been 
to raise the dignity of the calling, to induce persons of a 
superior class to adopt it in increasing numbers, to enlarge 
the demand for their services, and to multiply the means of 
educating them. 

Nursing does not appear to be regulated by law in any 
country, though attempts in this direction had been made in 
England. 1 Its organization is voluntary, and even in training 
state or municipal institutions is dependent on the and 
direction of the administration. In Great Britain organlza- 
nearly all the general and special hospitals and many tion * 
of the poor-law infirmaries offer systematic professional training 
to nurses. The provisions differ considerably in detail, but in 
the larger schools the system is uniform in all important respects. 
Candidates must be between 23 (sometimes 21 or 22) and 35 
years of age, and must produce satisfactory evidence of character, 
education, health and physique; after a personal interview 
and one, two or three months' trial they are admitted for three 
years' training. During this period they receive regular instruc- 
tion in theoretical and practical knowledge, and have to pass 
periodical examinations. At the end of it they are granted 
certificates and may serve as staff nurses. They pay no premium, 
and generally receive a salary of £8 to £12 in the first year, 
rising annually to £30 or £35 as staff nurse, and subsequently 
to £40 or £50 as sister or head nurse. They live in a home 
attached to the institution, under a matron, and in the most 
modern establishments each nurse has a separate bedroom, 
with common dining and recreation rooms. Private nursing 
staffs are attached to several of the hospitals; they are recruited 
from the staff nurses and probationers on completion of their 
course, and supply nurses to private patients. In the special 

	[1] In 1902 an actw as passed to establish a Central Midwives Board 
	and regulated the training and employment of midwives. 

hospitals the training is shorter, being for one or two years. 
There seems to be a constant tendency to increase the require- 
ments. At St Bartholomew's, St George's, the London Hospital, 
St Thomas's and others, probationers must enter for four years, 
and at St Bartholomew's they have to pass an entrance examina- 
tion in elementary anatomy, physiology and other subjects. 
At all the more important schools the number of applications 
is many times greater than the vacancies. 

In Great Britain trained and certificated nurses generally 
belong to a society or association. The most noteworthy of 
the associations is Queen Victoria's Jubilee Institute for Nurses. 
It was founded in 1887 with the object of providing skilled 
nursing for the sick poor in their own homes. A great many of 
the provincial nursing associations are affiliated to it. The 
number of nurses supported by each branch varies. The qualifica- 
tions for a Queen's nurse are as follows: (1) training at an 
approved general hospital or infirmary for two years; (2) 
approved training in district nursing for not less than six months, 
including the nursing 'of mothers and infants after child-birth; 
(3) nurses in country districts must in addition have had at least 
three months' approved training in midwifery. Candidates 
possessing the first qualification are received on trial for one 
month, after which they complete their six months' training 
for the second qualification, at the same time entering into an 
agreement to serve as district nurse for one or two years at the 
end of the six months. The salary during training is£i 2, 1 os.,and 
afterwards £30 to £35 a year, with board, lodging, laundry and 
uniform. With regard to the earnings of nurses in general, the 
salaries paid in hospitals have already been mentioned; for 
private work the scales in force at different institutions vary 
considerably, according to the other advantages and benefits 
provided. At some the nurses receive all their own earnings, 
minus a percentage deducted for the maintenance of the institute; 
at others they are paid a fixed salary, as a rule from £25 to £30 
a year, plus a varying percentage on their earnings or a periodical 
bonus according to length of service. This is perhaps the 
commonest system, but some of the best nursing homes give a 
somewhat higher fixed salary without any percentage. In all 
these cases the nurses receive in addition board and lodging, 
laundry and uniform, or an equivalent allowance. For special 
cases — infectious, massage, mental and maternity — nurses on 
a fixed salary usually receive extra pay. The fees commonly 
charged by high-class institutions for the services of a trained 
and certificated nurse are — for ordinary cases £2, 2s. a week, 
for special cases £2, 1 2s. 6d. or £3, 3s. a week; but many provincial 
associations supply nurses for £1, is. a week and upwards. 
The discrepancy between the fees paid by patients and the 
salaries received by nurses, especially in London, has occasionally 
excited unfavourable comment, but it is to be remembered that 
the nurses are maintained when out of work or ill, and have other 
advantages; many institutions either provide pensions or assist 
the members of their staff to join the Royal National Pension 
Fund. 

To complete this account of the organization in Great Britain a 
few details with regard to special nursing are added. 

Fever. — Regular training on the same plan as in general hospitals 
is provided in London at the fever hospitals of the Metropolitan 
Asylums Board (12 in number, with from 360 to 760 beds each), 
and at a considerable number of provincial institutions. 

Insanity. — The Medico-Psychological Association of Great Britain 
and Ireland holds examinations and grants certificates in mental 
nursing; candidates must undergo three years' regular training, with 
instruction by lectures, &c, which may be obtained in a large 
number of public asylums by arrangement with the Association; 
one county asylum (Northampton) gives its own certificates after a 
three years* course. 

District Nursing. — In addition to the Queen's nurses, of whom 
details have been given above, many local associations train their 
own nurses for this work. Cottage and village nursing are varieties 
of the same department; the former is organized on the benefit 
system, and aims at supplying domestic help and sick-nursing 
combined in rural districts for an annual subscription of from 2s. 
to ios., according to the class in life of the family, and a weekly 
fee of the same amount during attendance. 

Monthly Nursing and Midwifery. — Systematic instruction in these 
subjects is given at some fifty lying-in institutions in different parts 
of the kingdom. The usual course for nursing is not less than three 
months, and for midwifery not less than six months; a premium 
is required of 12 or 13 guineas for three months, and 25 guineas 
for six months. 

Male Nursing. — Two or three associations in London supply male 
nurses (fees 2 to 4 guineas a week), but there appears to be only one 
institution, apart from the military and naval services, at which they 
are systematically trained — namely, the National Hospital for the 
Paralysed and Epileptic. 

Massage is taught regularly at the hospital just named, and at a 
few other special hospitals. Competent operators are supplied by 
the Incorporated Society of Trained Masseuses and, to some extent, 
by other nursing associations; but this branch of the profession is 
still imperfectly organized (see Massage). 

Children. — A large number of children's hospitals throughout 
the country give regular training in the nursing of children; they 
take probationers at a somewhat earlier age than the general 
schools; the course is usually shorter (one or two years), and the 
salaries slightly lower. 

The State offers employment to nurses in the naval and military 
hospitals. Queen Alexandra's Imperial Nursing Service was organized 
in 1902. Candidates for it must be between 25 and 35 years, single 
or widows and of good social status. They must have had three 
years' training in a general hospital. Foreign Service must be taken 
as required. Nurses are eligible for a pension after 10 years' service, 
the amount increasing up to the age of 55 when retirement is com- 
pulsory. The Royal Naval Nursing Service is organized on much the 
same basis. Other organizations are The Army Nursing Reserve and 
Queen Alexandra's Imperial Military Nursing Reserve, and there is 
also a nursing reserve attached to the territorial forces. 

In the more important 'British colonies — Australasia, Canada 
and South Africa — there are now a considerable number of 
hospital schools and other institutions formed and conducted 
on the English model. Salaries and fees are very much the same 
in Australia; in Canada and South Africa they are higher. 

In the United States a similar system prevails in New York, 
Boston, Brooklyn, Chicago, Baltimore, Philadelphia, New 
Haven and many other large towns. The period of training is 
either two or three years. At the Johns Hopkins School at 
Baltimore twelve scholarships of $100 and $120 each are 
awarded annually; graduate nurses are paid $360 (£72) a 
year. Salaries are altogether much higher in the United States. 
At the Boston City Hospital graduate nurses receive $420 (£84) 
a year, and at the Indianapolis City Hospital those on private 
duty are paid $72 a month, which is equivalent to £172 a year, 
with board, lodging, laundry and uniform. This may be taken 
to indicate the possible earnings of trained nurses working 
independently, as they usually do in America. The fees charged 
for trained nurses run from $12 to $25 a week, and even more for 
special cases. Male nurses are trained at the Bellevue Hospital, 
New York, the Grace Hospital, Detroit, and elsewhere. In the 
American schools more attention is paid to the preparation of 
nurses for private work than in the British (Burdett), and a 
directory or registry of them is kept in most large towns. 

In Germany, their original home, both training schools and 
societies have multiplied and developed. The period of training 
appears to be considerably shorter than in Great Britain and 
America. Members of the Albert Society of Saxony, however, 
spend two years in the wards at Dresden, and a third at Leipzig, 
attending lectures and demonstrations. They are sent out to 
nurse rich and poor alike, and their pay is very small. Most 
of the German institutes have pension funds. 

In France a great deal of the nursing was formerly in the 
hands of religious orders, but there too the hospital school 
system, inaugurated in 1877, has grown. The schools managed 
by the Assistance Publique in Paris give a very thorough course 
of instruction. 

In Russia nursing is mainly in the hands of the Red Cross 
Society, whose members are, however, trained in the hospital 
schools. 

In Italy, Spain, Portugal and Belgium scientific nursing is 
in a backward state. The old religious system still prevails 
to a large extent, and, though some of the orders do their work 
with great devotion, the standard of knowledge and skill is not 
up to modern requirements. At San Remo and Rome institu- 
tions have been established {or providing English trained nurses 
to private cases. 

Austria is also in a very backward state, in spite of the fame 
of the Vienna cliniques. The Red Cross Society provides a 
certain amount of trained nursing, and next to it the best- 
organized work is done by religious orders; but the nursing 
in the hospitals appears to be still in a neglected state. The 
Brothers of Mercy have charge of some of the men's 
hospitals, and also carry on a remarkable system of district 
nursing. 

In Holland and the Scandinavian countries the organization 
is more modern and fairly adequate. 

For full details on the large subject of the duties and qualifica- 
tions of nurses the reader is referred to the numerous text-books 
and other technical authorities. Only a few general 
Duties and observations can be made here. Many candidates 
lionL Ca ' approach the calling with a very imperfect apprecia- 
tion of its exacting character. The work is not easy 
or to be taken up lightly. It demands physical strength, sound 
health, scrupulous cleanliness, good temper, self-control, intelli- 
gence and a strong sense of duty. It embraces many duties — 
some of them menial and disagreeable — besides the purely 
medical and surgical functions. This is especially the case 
with district nursing, which is the highest and most exact- 
ing branch of the profession, because it imposes the greatest 
responsibility with the fewest resources and demands the most 
varied qualifications, while affording none of the attractions 
incidental to hospital work or private nursing among the rich. 
It is comparatively easy to fulfil routine duties, when every 
means is at hand and the standing conditions are the most 
favourable possible; when ventilation, warmth, light and 
cleanliness are all provided of the best, and when assistance 
can be summoned in a moment* To be thrown on your own 
resources and make the best of adverse conditions is an entirely 
different matter; it requires a thorough knowledge not of 
routine, but of principles. It is impossible, therefore, for nurses 
to be over-educated in the fullest sense of the word; but it is 
possible for them to be inappropriately educated, and perhaps 
that is sometimes the case now. Probably nursing has been 
elaborated to the inevitable point of specialization, and a some- 
what different preparation is needed for different branches of 
the art. 

Allusion has been made above to the subject of male nursing. 
It hardly finds a place in the British civil system, and was con- 
demned for hospitals in Germany, where it is at its best, by so 
eminent an authority as Professor Virchow. In the South 
African War of 1 890-1902 it was even suggested that female 
nurses should replace orderlies at the front. The only valid 
reason for preferring women to attend men rather than members 
of their own sex is the difficulty of obtaining a supply of equally 
well qualified and satisfactory male nurses. But this difficulty 
need not be permanent, and the assumption is much to be 
deprecated. It is, indeed, most desirable that men should be 
nursed by men. The advantages are many and real. For one 
thing women do not possess the physical strength which is 
often required. They cannot lift a heavy man, and ought not 
to be asked to do it. Then it h excessively irksome to a sensitive 
man to be attended by women for various necessary offices. In 
order to avoid it he will endeavour to do without assistance, and 
seriously prejudice his chances of recovery.

NUSHKI, a town and district of Baluchistan. The town 
lies 70 m. south-west of Quetta, and is situated in a plain at the 
base of the Quetta plateau, 2900 ft. above the sea. Pop. (1901) 
644. From this point the flat Baluchistan desert stretches away 
northwards and westwards to the Helmund river. The adminis- 
tration of the Nushki district was taken over from the khan of 
Kalat by the Indian government in 1896, and was leased from 
him on a perpetual quit rent in 1899. In 1902 a railway of 
91 m. was sanctioned from Quetta to Nushki, which was com- 
pleted in 1905. This railway makes Nushki the starting-point 
of the caravan route to Seistan. From the strategic point of 
view a force operating from Nushki would flank any advance 
from the north on Kandahar, and would also guard the south- 
west approach to the fortress of Quetta. 


NUSKU, the name of the light and fire-god in Babylonia and 
Assyria, who is hardly to be distinguished, from a certain time 
on, from a god Girru — formerly read Gibil. Nusku-Girru is 
the symbol of the heavenly as well as of the terrestrial fire. As 
the former he is the son of Anu, the god of heaven, but he is 
likewise associated with Bel of Nippur as the god of the earth 
and regarded as his first-born son. A centre of his cult in 
Assyria was in Harran, where, because of the predominating 
character of the moon-cult, he is viewed as the son of the moon- 
god Sin (q.v.). Nusku-Girru is by the side of Ea, the god of water, 
the great purifier. It is he, therefore, who is called upon to 
cleanse the sick and suffering from disease, which, superinduced 
by the demons, was looked upon as a species of impurity affecting 
the body. 

The fire-god is also viewed as the patron of the arts and the 
god of civilization in general, because of the natural association 
of all human progress with the discovery and use of fire. As 
among other nations, the fire-god was in the third instance looked 
upon as the protector of the family. He becomes the mediator 
between humanity and the gods, since it is through the fire on 
the altar that the offering is brought into the presence of 
the gods. 

While temples and sanctuaries to Nusku-Girru are found in 
Babylonia and Assyria, he is worshipped more in symbolical 
form than the other gods. For the very reason that his presence 
is common and universal he is not localized to the same extent 
as his fellow-deities, and, while always enumerated in a list of 
the great gods, his place in the systematized pantheon is more 
or less vague. The conceptions connected with Nusku are of 
distinctly popular origin, as is shown by his prominence in 
incantations, which represent the popular element in the cult, 
and it is significant that in the astro-theological system of the 
Babylonian priests Nusku-Girru is not assigned to any particular 
place in the heavens. (M. Ja.) 


NUSRETABAD, the capital of Persian Seistan, so called after 
Nusret el Mulk, a former deputy governor of Seistan; when 
built, c. 1870, it was first called Nasirabad in honour of Nasr-ud- 
din Shah; other names, used locally, are Shahr (town) i Seistan, 
Shahr i Nassiriyeh, or simply Shahr, the town. It.is the residence 
of British and Russian consuls, and has post and telegraph 
offices. 


NUT (O. Eng. knutiiy cf. Dutch noot, Ger. Nuss; allied with 
Gael, cno; it is not of the same form as Lat. mix), a term applied 
to that class of fruit which consists generally of a single kernel 
enclosed in a hard shell. Botanically speaking, nuts are one- 
celled fruits with hardened pericarps, sometimes more or less 
enveloped in a cupule or cup, formed by the aggregation of the 
bracts as in the hazel and the acorn. In commerce, however, the 
term has a wider application and embraces many fruits having 
hard woody indehiscent shells or coverings without reference to 
their enclosed seeds or kernels, besides leguminous pods, and 
even tuberous roots. A great number of nuts enter into commerce 
for various purposes, principally as articles of food or sources 
of oil, and for several ornamental and useful purposes. For the 
most part the edible nuts are very rich in oil, with only a small 
percentage of the other carbohydrates, starch, sugar, &c, and 
they also contain a large proportion of nitrogenous constituents. 
Thus possessing rich nutrient principles in a highly concentrated 
form, nuts are by themselves rather difficult of digestion, and 
the liability of many of them to become rancid is also a source 
of danger and a hindrance to their free. use. Oleaginous nuts 
used for food are likewise employed more or less as sources of 
oil, but on the other hand there are many oil-nuts of commercial 
importance not embraced in the list of edible nuts. 

On the following page is set out an alphabetical enumeration

name, used either as articles of food or as sources of oil.

The application of the term nut to many of these products is 
purely arbitrary, and it is obvious that numerous other bodies 
not known commercially as nuts might with equal propriety 
be included in the list. Most of the nuts of real commercial 
importance are or will be 
separately noticed, and here 
further allusion is only made 
to a few which form current 
articles of commerce, not 
otherwise treated of. 

The bread nut of Jamaica is the fruit of a lofty tree, 
Brosimum Alicastrum. It is about an inch in diameter, 
and encloses a single seed, which, roasted or boiled, is 
a pleasant and nutritious article of food. 

The souari or surahwa 
nut, called also the " Butter nut of Demerara," and by 
fruiterers the " Suwarrow nut," is the fruit of Caryocar 
nuciferum, a native of the forests of Guiana, growing 
80 ft. in height. This is perhaps the finest of all the 
fruits called nuts. The kernel is large, soft, and 
even sweeter than the almond, which it somewhat 
resembles in taste. The few that are imported come from 
Demerara, and are about the size of an egg, somewhat 
kidney-shaped, of a rich reddish-brown colour, and 
covered with large rounded tubercles. 

The pekea nut, similar in appearance and properties, 
is the produce of Caryocar butyrosum, growing in the 
same regions of tropical America. 

The Jamaica cob nut is the produce of a euphor- 
biaceous tree, Omphalea 
diandra, the seeds of which resemble in taste the ordinary cob 
or hazel nut. The seed, however, contains a deleterious em- 
bryo, which must not be eaten. 

Cola, kola or goora nuts are the seeds of Cola acuminata 

(Sterculiaceae), a tree, native 
of tropical Africa, now introduced into the West Indies 
and South America. The nuts form an important 
article of commerce throughout Central Africa, being 
used over a wide area as a kind of stimulant condiment. 
The nuts, of which there are numerous varieties, are 
found to contain a notable proportion of theine, as much 
as 2*13 %, besides theobromine and other important 
food-constituents, to which circumstances, doubtless, 
their valuable properties are due. 

Coquilla nuts, the hard 
inner portion (" stone ") of the palm, Attalea funifera, thepiassaba 
of Brazil, are highly valued for turnery purposes. They have an 
elongated oval form, 3 to 4 in. in length, and being intensely hard 
they take a fine polish, displaying a richly streaked brown colour.

The marking nut, Semecarpus Anacardium, is a fruit closely 
allied in its source and properties to the cashew nut (q.v.). The 
marking nut is a native of the East Indies, where the extremely 
acrid juice of the shell of the fruit in its unripe state is mixed 
with quicklime and used as a marking-ink. The juice also 
possesses medicinal virtues as an external application, and when 
dry it is the basis of a valuable caulking material and black 
varnish. The seeds are edible, and the source of a useful oil. 

Physic nuts are the produce of the euphorbiaceous tree, 
Curcas purgans, whence a valuable oil, having similar purgative 
properties to castor oil, is obtained. The plant is a native 
of South America, but is now found throughout all tropical 
countries. 

Pine nuts are the seeds of several species of Pinus, eaten in 
the countries of their growth, and also serving to some extent 
as sources of oil. Of these the most important are the stone 
pine, Finns Pinea, of Italy and the Mediterranean coasts, and 
the Russian stone pine, Pinus Cembra. The Pinus Sabiniana 
of California and P. Gerardiana of the Himalayas similarly 
yield edible seeds. These seeds possess a pleasant, slightly 
resinous flavour. 

Ravensara nuts, the fruit of Agalhophyllum aromaticum 
(Lauraceae), a native of Madagascar, is used as a spice under the 
name of the Madagascar clove nutmeg. 

The Sapucaya nut, a native of Brazil, is seen occasionally 
in fruit-shops. It is produced by a large tree, Lecylhis Ollaria, 
or " cannon-ball tree." Its specific name is taken from the large 
urn-shaped capsules, called " monkey-pots " by the inhabitants, 
which contain the nuts. The sapucaya nut has a sweet flavour, 
resembling the almond, and if better known would be highly 
appreciated. It is, however, scarce, as the monkeys and other 
wild animals are said to be particularly fond of it. This nut, 
which is of a rich amber-brown, is not unlike the Brazil nut, 
but it has a smooth shell furrowed with deep longitudinal 
wrinkles. 

Soap nuts are the fruits of various species of Sapindus, especially 
S. Saponaria, natives of tropical regions. They are so called 
because their rind or outer covering contains a principle, saponine, 
which lathers in water, and so is useful in washing. The pods of 
Acacia concinna, amative of India, possess the same properties, 
and are also known as soap nuts. 


NUTATION (from Lat. nutare, to nod), a revolution of the 
celestial pole around its mean position, due to inequalities in 
the action of the sun and moon, on an earth of ellipsoidal form. 
When either of these attracting bodies is in the plane of the 
equator, it produces no change in the direction of the celestial 
pole. The greater their distance from this plane, the greater 
the change, for reasons shown in the article Astronomy (Celestial 
Mechanics). The result is a motion which can be divided into 
two components. One of these is the progressive and nearly 
uniform motion of a fictitious mean pole, called precession (g.v.), 
and the other a revolution of the true around the mean pole, de- 
pending on the varying declinations of the sun and moon, and 
called nutation. Owing to the revolution of the moon's node 
and the inclination of its orbit, this body moves through a wider 
range of declination in some positions of the node than in others. 
The period of the revolution of the node is 18-6 years. At one 
time of this period the limits of its declination are more than 
28 north and south, while, at the opposite point, they are little 
more than 18 . The result of these periodic changes is that the 
nutation takes place nearly in an ellipse, differing little from a 
circle, at a distance of about 0/, in a period of about 18-6 years. 
The motion is not exactly an ellipse, having a great number of 
minute inequalities arising from the ellipticity of the orbits 
of the sun and moon and their varying declinations. The amount 
and formulae of nutation from year to year are given in the 
Nautical Almanac. 


NUTCRACKER, the name given by G. Edwards in 1758 
(Gleanings, No. 240) to a bird which had hitherto borne no 
English appellation, though described in 1544 by Turner, who, 
meeting with it in the Rhaetic Alps, where it was called " Nous- 
brecher " (hodie " Nussbrecher "), translated that term into 
Latin as Nucifraga. In 1555 C. Gesner figured it and conferred 
upon it another designation, Caryocatactes. It is the Conns 
caryocatactes of Linnaeus and the Nucifraga caryocatactes of 
modern ornithology. F. Willughby and J. Ray obtained it 
on the road from Vienna to Venice as they crossed what must have 
been the Sommerring Pass, 26th September 1663. The first 
known to have occurred in Britain was, according to T. Pennant, 
shot at Mostyn in Flintshire, 5th October 1753, and about 
fifteen more examples have since been procured, and others seen, 
in the island. Contrary to what was for many years believed, 
the nest of the Nutcracker seems to be invariably built on the 
bough of a tree, some 20 ft. from the ground, and is a compara- 
tively large structure of sticks, lined with grass. The eggs are 
of a very pale bluish-green, sometimes nearly spotless, but 
usually more or less freckled with pale olive or ash-colour. The 
chief food of the Nutcracker appears to be the seeds of various 
conifers, which it extracts as it holds the cones in its foot, and 
it has been questioned whether the bird has the faculty of crack- 
ing nuts — properly so called — with its bill, though that can be 
used with much force and, at least in confinement, with no 
little ingenuity. The old supposition that the Nutcrackers had 
any affinity to the Woodpeckers (Picidae) or were intermediate 
in position between them and the Crows (Corvidae) is now known 
to be wholly erroneous, for they undoubtedly belong to the latter 
family (see also Crow). (A. N.) 


NUTHATCH, in older English Ntjthack, from its habit of 
hacking or chipping nuts, which it cleverly fixes, as though in a 
vice, in a chink or crevice of the bark of a tree, and then hammers 
them with the point of its bill till the shell is broken. This bird 
was long thought to be the Sitta europaea of Linnaeus; but that is 
now admitted to be the northern form, with the lower parts white, 
and its buff-breasted representative in central, southern and 
western Europe, including England, is known as Sitta caesia. 
It is not found in Ireland, and in Scotland its appearance is 
merely accidental. Without being very plentiful anywhere, it is 
generally distributed in suitable localities throughout its range — 
those localities being such as afford it a sufficient supply of food, 
consisting during the greater part of the year of insects, which it 
diligently seeks on the boles and larger limbs of old trees; but 
in autumn and winter it feeds on nuts, beech-mast, the stones of 
yew-berries and hard seeds. Being of a bold disposition, and 
the trees favouring its mode of life often growing near houses, it 
will become on slight encouragement familiar with men; and its 
neat attire of ash-grey and warm buff, together with its sprightly 
gestures, render it an attractive visitor. It generally makes its 
nest in a hollow branch, plastering up the opening with clay, 
leaving only a circular hole just large enough to afford entrance 
and exit; and the interior contains a bed of dry leaves or the 
filmy flakes of the inner bark of a fir or cedar, on which the eggs 
are laid. In the Levant occurs another species, S. syriaca, with 
somewhat different habits, as it haunts rocks rather than trees; 
and four or five representatives of the European arboreal species 
have their respective ranges from Asia Minor to the Himalayas 
and Northern China. North America possesses nearly as many; 
but, curiously enough, the geographical difference of coloration 
is just the reverse of what it is in Europe — the species with a deep 
rufous breast, S. canadensis, being that which has the most 
northern range, while the white-bellied S. carolinensis, with its 
western form, S. aculeata, inhabits more southern latitudes. 
The Ethiopian Region has as representative of the group the 
Hypositta corallirostris of Madagascar. Callisilta and Dcndro- 
phila are nearly allied genera, inhabiting the Indian Region, and 
remarkable for their beautiful blue plumage. Sittella y with four 
or five species, is found in Australia and New Guinea, whilst 
Daphnoesitta occurs in New Guinea. The nuthatches are placed 
in the Passerine family Sittidae, intermediate between the 
Paridae and the Certhiidae. (A. N.) 

NUTMEG (from " nut," and 0. Fr. tnugue, musk, Lat. muscus), 
the commercial name of a spice representing the kernel of the 
seed of Myristica fragrans (fig. 1), a dioecious evergreen tree, 
about 50 to 60 ft. high, found wild in the Banda Islands and a 
few of the neighbouring islands, extending to New Guinea. 

Nutmeg and mace are almost exclusively obtained from the 
Banda Islands, although the cultivation has been attempted with 
varying success in Singapore, Penang, Bengal, Reunion, Brazil, 
French Guiana and the West Indies. The trees yield fruit in eight

years after sowing the seed, reach their prime in twenty-five years, 
and bear for sixty years or longer. Almost the whole surface of 
the Banda Islands is planted with nutmeg trees, which thrive 
under the shade of the lofty Canarium commune. In Bencoolen 
the tree bears all the year round, but the chief harvest takes 
place in the later months of the year, and a smaller one in April, 
May and June. The ripe fruit is about 2 in. in diameter, of a 
rounded pear-shape, and when mature 
splits into two, exposing a crimson arillus 
surrounding a single seed (figs. 1,2). When 
the fruit is collected the pericarp is first 
removed; then the arillus is carefully 
stripped off and dried, in which state it 
forms the mace of commerce. The seed 
consists of a thin, hard testa or shell, 
enclosing a wrinkled kernel, which, when 
dried, is the nutmeg. The kernel consists 
mainly of the abundant endosperm, which

The process of liming, which originated at the time when the 
Dutch held a monopoly of the trade, was with the view of pre- 
venting the germination of the seeds, which were formerly 
immersed for three months in milk of lime for this purpose, 
and a preference is still manifested in some 
countries for nutmegs so prepared. It has, 
however, been shown that this treatment 
is by no means necessary, since exposure 
to the sun for a week destroys the vitality 
of the kernel, Penang nutmegs are never 
limed. The entire fruit preserved in syrup 
is used as a sweetmeat in the Dutch East 
Indies. 

11 Oil of mace," or nutmeg butter, is a solid 
fatty substance of a reddish- brown colour, 
obtained by grinding the refuse nutmegs to a 
fine powder, enclosing it in bags and steaming it over large cauldrons 
for five or six hours, and then compressing it while still warm between 
powerful wedges, the brownish fluid which flows out being after- 
wards allowed to solidify. Nutmegs yield about one-fourth of their 
weight of this substance. It is partly dissolved by cold alcohol, the 
remainder being soluble in ether. _ The latter portion, about 10% of 
the weight of the nutmegs, consists chiefly of myristin, which is a 
compound of myristic acid, CmHs^x, with glycerin. The fat which is 
soluble in alcohol appears to consist, according to Schmidt and 
Roemer (Arch. Pharm. [5], xxi. 34-48), of free myristic and stearic 
acids; the brown colouring matter has not been satisfactorily in- 
vestigated. Nutmeg butter yields on distillation with water a 
volatile oil to the extent of about 6%, consisting almost entirely of a 
hydrocarbon called myristicene x CioHi«, boiling at 165 C. It is 
accompanied by a small quantity of an oxygenated oil, myristicol, 
isomeric with earvol, but differing from it in not forming a crystalline 
compound with hydrosulphuric acid. Mace contains a similar 
volatile oil, macene, boiling at'i6o° C, which is said by Cloez to differ 
from that of nutmegs in yielding a solid compound when treated with 
hydrochloric acid gas. 

The name nutmeg is also applied to other fruits or seeds in 
different countries. The Jamaica or calabash nutmeg is derived 
from Monodora Myristica, the Brazilian from Cryptocarya 
moschata, the Peruvian from Laurelia sempervirens, the Mada- 
gascar or clove nutmeg from Agathophyllum aromaticum, and 
the Californian or stinking nutmeg from Torreya Myristica. 
The cotyledons of Nectandra Ptichury were at one time offered 
in England as nutmegs. 


NUTRITION, The physiology of nutrition involves the study 
of the way in which the tissues of the body, and more especially 
the great master tissues, muscle and nerve, obtain the material 
for growth and repair and the energy for mechanical work and 
heat production, and of the mode in which they get rid of the 
waste products of their activity. The study is therefore very 
largely a study of the history of the food of the body, since it is 
in the food that the necessary matter and energy are supplied. 
Under Dietetics the composition and special importance of 
various foods and the laws which regulate the supply of food 
under different conditions of the body are separately dealt with. 
Here the mode of digestion, the utilization v and the elimination 
of the end products of the three great constituents, proteins, 
carbohydrates and fats, are alone considered. They are treated 
under the following heads: I. The Chemistry 'of Digestion; 
II. The Mode of Formation of the Digestive Secretions; III. The 
Mechanism by which the Food is passed along the Alimentary 
Canal; IV. The Absorption of Food; V. Metabolism; VI. 
Excretion. 

I. Chemistry of Digestion 

The essential step which prepares the ordinary food for 
utilization in the body, for the change into living matter, is 
digestion, a process which the food undergoes under the influence 
of the ferments or enzymes present in the gastro-intestinal tract. 
By this process it is broken down into simpler substances, which 
can be utilized by the body tissues for conversion into proto- 
plasm and as the supply of energy. That part which is unsuited 
for use in the body is either passed as faeces or absorbed and 
excreted in the urine. 

1. Enzyme Action generally. — The substances which bring 
about this change are known as ferments, enzymes or zymins. 
Formerly it was believed that there were two distinct classes 
of enzymes, those which were living or associated with living 
cells, and those which were non-living. In 1897, however, E. 
Buchner and M. Hahn showed that from living cells (yeast) 
a ferment could be obtained which acted quite as well 
extracellularly as when it was bound up within the cell. 
Subsequent work has shown that other organisms act by the 
enzymes they contain, so that it is now recognized that there is 
no essential difference between the living or organized ferment 
and the non-living or unorganized ferment. All ferments prob- 
ably act as catalysators or catalysts. Catalysis js the process 
by which reactions are either initiated or accelerated by the mere 
presence of certain substances which remain unchanged during 
the process; to these substances the name of catalysators has 
been given. As an example of such catalytic action the accelera- 
tion of the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) into 
water (H2O) and oxygen (0) by the action of a colloidal solution 
of platinum may be given. C. Oppenheimer defines an enzyme 
as a substance produced by living cells, which acts by catalysis. 
E. Fischer has shown that the action of ferments is specific, that 
is, the ferment only exerts its action on definite substances or 
substrates of definite structural arrangement. He has compared 
the relation of ferment to substrate to that of a key to its lock. 
Ferments which bring about the breakdown of proteins are with- 
out influence on fats and carbohydrates; those which decompose 
fats leave proteins and carbohydrates untouched, and so on. 

The chemical composition of enzymes is unknown. It has been 
assumed that they are protein in nature, but this is mainly because it 
has been found that when they arc extracted from tissues they are 
apparently in combination with proteins. In all probability the 
protein is there as an impurity owing to incomplete separation. 

As regards the general properties of enzymes, most of them can be 
precipitated from their solutions by means of alcohol. They can 
also be carried down by fine precipitates of certain inorganic salts or 
by protein precipitation, e.p when a precipitate of casein is produced 
by acidifying a casein solution with acetic acid. Most of the ferments 
are soluble in water or saline solutions, and in glycerin and water. 
The ferments are found to have an optimum temperature of action. 
This temperature in most cases ranges from 37 to 40 C. All true 
ferments are thermolabilc f> being destroyed at about 70 C. Ferments 
are hindered in their action to some extent by the general proto- 
plasmic poisons, such as salicylic acid, chloroform, &c. The action 
of many of them is retarded when the products of their action are 
allowed to accumulate. Just as when a chemical reaction is set up 
its rate tends to decrease and finally comes to a standstill before the 
reaction is completed — an equilibrium being established — so the 
reactions set up by enzymes also tend to come to an equilibrium 
before the complete conversion of the original substance. In the 
case of certain enzymes at least this equilibrium may be reached from 
either side? thus the enzyme maltase may either bring about the 
breakdown of the sugar maltose to dextrose or cause a synthesis of 
dextrose to maltose. 

A number of the body ferments have now been shown to exist in 
the tissues in an inactive form. This condition is known as the pro- 
ferment or zymogen state, and before any action can be exerted it 
must be activated, usually by some specific substance, as in the case 
of the activation of trypsinogen by means of enterokinase. The fol- 
lowing table gives a list of the principal ferments concerned in the di- 
gestion and metabolism of food-stuffs: —

2. Digestion in the Mouth. — The first of the digestive secre- 
tions which food comes into contact with is the saliva. This 
is the mixed secretion from the various glands, salivary and 
other, the ducts of which open in the mouth. The saliva, which 
is for the most part produced by the three large salivary glands, 
the parotid, the sub-maxillary and the sub-lingual, is a colour- 
less or a slightly turbid viscous fluid with a faintly alkaline 
reaction and of low specific gravity. It contains a very small 
proportion of solids, which vary somewhat in amount and 
character in the secretions of the different glands. Mucin and 
traces of other proteins are present. Small amounts of potassium 
sulphocyanide may nearly always be detected. The functions 
of the saliva are twofold. First, it has a mechanical action 
moistening the mouth and the food and thus aiding mastication 
and swallowing by securing the formation of a proper bolus 
of food; it also assists by binding the particles together, an 
action of special importance when the food is dry. Second, 
in man and in some of the lower animals the enzyme ptyalin 
exerts an action in digestion on part of the carbohydrates of 
the diet. The starches or polysaccharides are broken down, 
first of all to the simple dextrins and then to the still more 
simple disaccharide, maltose. The further breakdown of the 
maltose is carried out in the intestine by the action of a ferment 
maltase which does not exist at all or only in the merest traces 
in the buccal secretion. The action of ptyalin on starches is 
thus very similar to that of acids, except that it stops at the 
formation of maltose. Ptyalin acts best at a temperature of 
about 40 C. and in a neutral or faintly alkaline medium, its 
action being inhibited by the presence of even very dilute 
solutions of the mineral acids. If the acid be in sufficient 
amount the enzyme is destroyed. For this reason the action 
ceases in the stomach whenever the bolus is completely per- 
meated by the gastric juice. As it takes time for the gastric 
juice thoroughly to permeate the food mass, which remains 
for a considerable period in the fundus of the stomach unmixed 
with the secretion, salivary digestion goes on for about half 
an hour after food is taken. 

3. Gastric Digestion. — The passage of food from the mouth 
to the stomach will be dealt with later. The stomach has two 
digestive functions: (1) It acts as a store chamber permitting 
a full meal to be taken; (2) It acts as a digestive organ of 
importance in preparing the food for further attack in the 
intestinal canal. But the stomach cannot be regarded as an 
essential organ, since it has been removed in dogs and in man 
without apparent interference with nutrition and health. 

Gastric digestion is brought about by the action of the gastric 
juice, a clear watery, colourless and strongly acid fluid with a 
specific gravity of about 1003. The amount of solids present 
is extremely small, about 0-3 %. They consist of protein, 
nucleic acid, lecithin and inorganic salts, in addition to the 
more important constituents, the enzymes and hydrochloric 
acid. 

The amount of hydrochloric acid present in the juice varies 
with the period of digestion. In man the maximum acid con- 
centration is about o*2 %. The acid exists in the stomach in 
two forms as free hydrochloric acid and as combined hydro- 
chloric acid. The amount of each depends on various factors: 
(1) the secretion itself; (2) the nature of the food; and (3) the 
rapidity with which the stomach empties itself, &c. For instance, 
after a protein-free meal the hydrochloric acid is for the most 
part free, whereas, when protein is present, it combines with it 
and, unless secreted in very large amount, most of the acid is 
in a fixed condition. 

The hydrochloric acid is formed by the activities of certain 
gland cells in the middle region of the stomach, and the fact 
that it does not exist as such in the blood proves that it is formed 
within these cells. Further, it has been found that the gastric 
mucous membranes of starving dogs contain 0*74 % of sodium 
and potassium chloride, much more than is present in any other 
organ or in the blood plasma. That the chlorine comes from 
the sodium chloride in the food has been shown by the fact 
that, when the tissues are deprived of this salt, and sodium 
bromide is given, hydrobromic acid may appear in the gastric 
secretion. 

The hydrochloric acid is essential for the action of the gastric 
enzyme, pepsin, in splitting up the protein of the food. In 
addition to this, the acid has a slight action in splitting poly- 
saccharides and disaccharides. Lastly, it acts as a bactericidal 
agent, preventing bacterial decomposition from taking place, and 
it may thus prevent certain noxious bacteria, taken in in the 
food, from gaining access to the intestinal tract, where there 
is a chance of their flourishing in the rich alkaline medium. It 
is owing to the presence of hydrochloric acid that gastric juice 
can be kept for prolonged periods without undergoing putre- 
faction. 

The quantity of juice secreted varies with the nature of the food 
consumed. Thus in one experiment, after the use of a test meal 
consisting of 25 grammes bread and 250 c.c. tea, there was a flow of 
106 c.c., whereas in another case with an ordinary meal there was an 
output of practically 600 c.c. gastric juice. 

Pawlow has shown that not only does the amount of juice secreted 
vary with the nature of the food ingested but that the digestive 
activity of the secretion also varies in the same way. He gives the 
following table: —

Thus each separate food gives rise to a definite hourly secretion of 
the juice and to a characteristic alteration in its properties. The 
meat diet brings about a very rapid flow, the maximum output 
taking place within the first two hours; with bread the maximum 
output is even earlier. With milk somewhat later. When the juice 
is examined as regardsits digestive activity, it is found that with 
meat the most active juice is secreted within the first hour, with 
bread in the second and third hours, and with milk in .the sixth hour. 
According to the nature of the food, the stomach seems to be 
stimulated to form a secretion which will best serve its purpose and 
give the minimum of waste. It thus works economically. 

The principal ferment found in the gastric juice is pepsin, a ferment 
which acts only in the presence of a mineral acid. The action pro- 
ceeds best at a temperature of about 37 ° C. in an acid medium of 
o-2 % to 0-3 %. Pepsin is elaborated in the so-called chief cells of 
the gastric glands as an Inert precursor — propepsin. It is only when 
it comes into contact with the acid of the juice that it is activated and 
rendered capable of attacking the protein of the food. 

As already mentioned, the main function of the gastric juice is to 
deal with the protein moiety of the food and to prepare it for further 
digestion in the intestine. 

The first result of the action of this secretion on protein matter is 
to render it soluble — a mctaprotcin or acid albumin (syntonin), 
being formed. This body may be regarded mainly as the product of 
the action of the hydrochloric acid independently of the pepsin. 

The following steps of decomposition are the result of the action 
of pepsin. From the metaprotein primary and secondary proteoses, 
the so-called proto-, hetero- and deutero-albumoscs are formed, and 
from these peptones are finally produced. The result of this process 
of digestion or hydrolysis induced by the pepsin is that complex 
protein substances of high molecular weight are converted into 
simpler bodies of comparatively low molecular weight. Formerly it 
was believed that the action of the pepsin on protein could not carry 
the decomposition further than the peptones, but recently it has been 
shown that still further splitting can be brought about, and that the 
simple amino acids of which the protein molecule is built up can be 
produced. This latter process, however, takes a very long time even 
under favourable circumstances, and it probably never occurs under 
normal conditions. The contents of the stomach — products of 
protein digestion — are passed on into the duodenum, chiefly as 
proteoses apd peptones. 

In addition to the principal ferment of the gastric juice some 
workers hold that another enzyme is present. This is the ferment 
rennet, rennin, or chymosin, the sole action of which, so far as is known 
at present, is to bring about the curdling of milk, the curd formed being 
dealt with in the ordinary way by the pepsin. Clotting of milk under 
thc > action of rennin occurs at a suitable temperature with great 
rapidity. This process is said to take place in two stages: (1) the 
rennin converts the caseinogen of the milk into paracasein, and (2) 
this paracasein unites with the lime salts present in the milk and forms 
the curd or precipitate. That lime salts are absolutely essential for 
this process of clotting has been shown by the fact that, if they are 
removed by precipitation as by oxalates, no clotting will take place 
even after the addition of a large amount of active rennin. Immedi- 
ate clotting takes place, however, when the necessary lime salts are 
restored. Many observers now hold that this rennet action is not the 
property of a specific ferment but simply another phase of the action 
of pepsin. For this view, which has^ been put forward by well- 
known workers, there is much to be said and certainly the power of 
curdling milk is not confined to the stomach, but has been found in 
various tissue extracts, and, indeed, wherever proteolytic enzymes 
are found. 

The speed with which the stomach is emptied depends to a great 
extent on the nature of the food. Plain water leaves the stomach 
almost at once, salt and sugar solutions at a somewhat slower rate. 
Milk under the action of rennin curdles. The whey rapidly leaves the 
stomach, whereas the casein and fat are retained for further treat- 
ment. On a mixed^ diet, emptying of the stomach in man proceeds 
very slowly, requiring about four hours. ^ Cannon, by feeding with 
food impregnated with bismuth and using X-rays, showed that 
carbohydrates leave most rapidly, then mixtures of carbohydrates and 
proteins, then proteins, then fats, and finally mixtures of fats and 
proteins. The diet which remains longest in the stomach is a 
mixture of fats and proteins — rich food, as it is popularly called. 
Here two factors enter to prevent rapid emptying: (1) the presence 
of much fat, and (2) the acid secretion engendered by the abundant 
protein. 

There is^ no doubt that fats present in fine emulsion can be de- 
composed in the stomach. The action proceeds in a medium which 
is slightly acid or neutral, being entirely prevented by the presence 
of strong acids and alkalis. Many workers believe this gastrolipase 
to be of pancreatic or intestinal origin, and suppose that it gains 
entrance to the stomach by a reflux flow through the pylorus. 
Evidence is accumulating to show that this view is correct. 

By means of pepsin and gastrolipase proteins and fats are deah 
with. No specific enzymefor carbohydrates has been found in the 
stomach in man. Certainly a small amount of polysaccharide 
decomposition takes place, but this is dependent (1) on the ptyalin 
which comes from the mouth, and (2) on a certain amount of hydro- 
lysis due to the action of the free hydrochloric acid. 

4. Digestion in the Intestine. — The passage of food from the 
stomach to the intestine will be considered later. The food 
so far digested in the stomach is known as chyme, and it is passed 
on to undergo intestinal digestion under the influence of (1) 
the enzymes of the pancreas, and (2) of other enzymes present 
in the different secretions of the intestine. Digestion in the 
intestine may accordingly be described under these two heads. 

(a) Pancreatic Digestion. — The pancreatic juice is the secretion 
from the pancreas and is discharged into the duodenum. The 
secretion obtained from *a fistula of the pancreatic duct varies 
in character according to whether the opening into the duct 
has been made recently or some time before the examination. 
It is a clear, usually thin fluid with a specific gravity of about 
1008, and with an alkaline reaction. It contains a certain 
amount of protein and ash. The most important inorganic 
constituent is sodium carbonate, which gives the alkaline re- 
action (alkalinity is, as NaOH = o-47%). This alkaline salt, 
along with that contained in the intestinal juice, plays an im- 
portant part in neutralizing the acid chyme. 

In the pancreatic secretion there are at least three important 
enzymes, each with a definite action: (a) trypsin, the proteolytic 
enzyme which brings about the further breakdown of the food 
proteins; (6) a diastase which deals with the carbohydrates, and 
(c) a lipase which acts on the fats. 

(a) Trypsin. — This ferment, in the form in which it is secreted — 
trypsinogen — is inert. Before it can exert its hydrolytic action it must 
be activated. This activation is brought about by another enzyme 
which is found in the intestinal tract — enterokinase. The con- 
version is brought about as soon as the trypsinogen comes into con- 
tact with the enterokinase, the_ merest trace of which suffices to 
activate a large amount of trypsinogen. 

Trypsin acts on the protein just as pepsin does, by bringing about 
hydrolytic changes. It differs from the latter in acting best in an 
alkaline or neutral medium. Its effect is much more energetic than 
that of pepsin, so that the protein molecule is more completely 
decomposed. Whilst it generally finishes the decomposition which 
the pepsin has begun, it can break down the original protein quite as 
easily if not more easily than does pepsin, and it carries the splitting 
as far as the comparatively simple crystalline bodies, the amino 
acids, or groups of these, the polypeptides, bodies intermediate 
between the complex peptones and the simple amino acids of which 
the protein is built up. 

The character and properties of the products formed in such 
digestion depend on the nature of the protein acted upon. As will 
be seen from the following table these proteins vary fairly widely in 
the proportion of amino acids which they contain.

Whether any of the polypeptides found in digestion are further 
broken down in the course of normal pancreatic digestion is a moot 
point, but E, Fischer and E. Abderhafden have shown that many of 
the synthetic polypeptides prepared by them can be broken into 
their constituents by the action of trypsin. The previous peptic 
digestion seems to play some part in the extent to which tryptic 
digestion is carried out, as one of these observers has demonstrated 
that protein digested first with pepsin and then with trypsin gives a 
smaller yield of polypeptide and a larger yield of monamino acids 
than when digestion has been carried out with trypsin alone. 

b. Diastase. — This ferment is found in the pancreatic juice appa- 
rently secreted in an active form, although ^ some observers hold 
that it also is secreted in a zymogen form. It is practically identical 
in its action with the ptyahn of the saliva, converting starch into 
maltose. It deals with all the starchy food which has escaped con- 
version into the simple sugars by the ptyalin. _ 

c. Lipase. — Most of this ferment, if not all, is apparently secreted 
in the form of a zymogen. There is evidence that the bile is the 
activating agent here, just as the enterokinase acts in the case of 
trypsin. Lipase can act in any medium acid, neutral, and alkaline, 
and both on emulsified and non-emulsified fats. It converts the fats 
by a process of hydrolysis into fatty acids and glycerin. Kastle and 
Loevenhart found that not only can this enzyme break up fats into 
their components, but that it also has the power to act in the reverse 
direction, and in this way bring about the union of fatty acids and 
glycerin so as to form fats, a process which occurs in the intestinal 
epithelial cells after absorption. 

In addition to these three enzymes the pancreatic juice may con- 
tain traces of others, for example, a rennet-like ferment which 
curdles milk. This again, as in the case of the stomach rennet, 
is held by some to be only another phase of proteolytic action. 
Maltase is also said to be present in small amount, as is also^ lactase 
under certain conditions. In pancreatic, as in gastric digestion, the 
nature of the food is said to play a part in controlling the amount 
and the composition of the secretion with respect to its ferments. 
The action, if it does exist, is not very well defined. 

b. Intestinal Digestion. — By this is meant the other digestive 
processes which go on in the intestine under the action of the 
secretion of Lieberkiihn's follicles — the succus entericus. This 
is a yellowish, often opalescent, strongly alkaline fluid. The 
alkalinity is due to the presence of sodium carbonate. It con- 
tains a small amount of protein, shed epithelial cells, &c. The 
secretion of some 170 c.c. in 24 hours has been observed in a 
short loop of human intestine by H. S. Hamburger and E. 
Hekma, but it is almost impossible to get a measure of the actual 
amount of secretion from the whole gut. Most of the ferments 
are present in very small amount in the intestinal juice. They seem 
to be actually within the epithelial lining of the intestine, for 
extracts made from the intestinal mucous membrane are richer 
in ferments than the secretion. 

Apparently the intestinal secretion contains no trace of a ferment 
acting on native protein, but a ferment — erepsin — is present in fair 
amount in the intestinal mucous membrane and in small amount in 
the secretion, which acts in an alkaline medium on proteoses, 
peptones, and on casein, converting them into crystalline products 
of the nature of amino acids. 

Another ferment, arginase, has been isolated from the intestinal 
mucous membrane by A. Kossel and H. D. Dakin, which splits the 
diamino acid arginin into urea and ornithin. A lipase has also been 
detected which is very similar to pancreatic lipase; it, however, 
attacks only emulsified fats. 

Several carbohydrate hydrolysing enzymes have been described 
in the small intestine. Invertin, the ferment which splits cane-sugar, 
is present in small amount in the secretion, more abundantly in the 
extract of mucous membrane. In all probability it deals with the 
saccharose after or in process of absorption. Maltase is also present 
in large amount, and here again in greater amount in the extract 
than in the secretion. The presence of lactase has been much dis- 
cussed, and it seems probable that suckling animals do possess this 
enzyme. Some workers have stated that an intestinal diastase is to 
be found, but, if so, it is present in very small amount. 

In the large intestine a small amount of erepsin has been dis- 
covered at the upper end. Any digestion which does take place is 
probably either bacterial in origin, or due to ferments which have 
originated in the lower end of the small intestine, and which have 
been carried down. 

5. Bile. — This fluid, in all probability, has little direct action 
in ordinary digestion, although it contains substances which 
act indirectly. The bile salts act as solvents for fats and fatty 
acids, and as activators of pancreatic lipase. The salts also 
serve to keep cholestrin in solution. Bile is to be looked upon 
rather as the excretion, the result of the hepatic metabolism, 
than as a digestive juice. Various workers have shown that 
when the bile is prevented from entering the intestine owing 
to a fistula having been made, the animal or patient may con- 
tinue to enjoy good health, thus proving that this fluid is not 
essential to any of the digestive processes which normally take 
place. 

Bile as secreted has an orange-brown colour, but the colour varies 
according to the pigment present. It is more or less viscous (not 
so viscous as bile taken from the gall bladder) and has a specific 
gravity of about 1010. It has a slightly alkaline reaction, a bitter 
taste and a characteristic smell. The daily output is, for a normal 
individual, over 500 c.c. On analysis it is found to have over 2 % of 
solids, of which more than half are organic. It contains in addition 
to a nucleo-albumin, derived mainly from the bile passages and gall 
bladder, bile acids, bile pigments, cholesterin, lecithin, fats, &c. The 
most abundant solids are the salts of the bile acids, of which in man 
the most important is sodium glycocholate, sodium taurocholate 
being present in very small amount. _ The bile acids are formed in 
the liver cells, and when the duct is ligatured they tend to accumu- 
late in the blood. 

The pigments amount to only about o-2 %. In human bile the 
chief pigment is bilirubin, whilst in herbivora biliverdin is more 
abundant. They are derived from the haemoglobin of the blood, 
but the pigments are iron-free. They may be regarded as purely 
excretory products arising from the breakdown of the haemoglobin 
of effete blood corpuscles. 

Cholesterin is a monatomic alcohol, and is probably a waste pro- 
duct. It occurs in the bile only in small amount, and there is some 
evidence that it is not secreted by the liver cells but is added to the 
bile from the bile passages. Fats and lecithin are both derived from 
the liver cells. Of the inorganic constituents phosphate of calcium 
is the most abundant. 

The secretion of bile is practically continuous, but it seems to enter 
the duodenum intermittently. The taking of food increases the flow 
of bile, the amount of the increase depending to a certain extent on 
the nature of the food. A protein meal has been found to have the 
greatest effect and a carbon ydrate one the least. The entry of the 
acid chyme into the duodenum is the stimulus which brings about the 
ejection of the bile. Pressure on the liver also seems to cause a flow 
(see section 11.). 

In connexion with bile secretion attention may be drawn here to a 
peculiar enterohepatic circulation which is stated to exist. The bile 
salts are partly absorbed from the intestine^ to be carried again by 
the portal blood to the liver and to be again eliminated. By this 
circulation the entrance of various alkaloidal and ptomaine poisons 
into the general circulation may be prevented. 

Faeces. — The bulk of the waste matter arising from the foods along 
with the secretions from the alimentary canal form the faeces. On 
an absorbable diet the faeces are almost purely intestinal in origin. 
As a channel of excretion of nitrogenous metabolic waste products 
they are not very important, although the work of C. Voit indicates 
that they do play a certain part. The nature of the excreted nitrogen- 
ous substances has not been fully examined. Of the inorganic con- 
stituents iron is probably for the most part excreted into the large 
intestine. It is, however, very difficultto come to any definite con- 
clusion as to what is unabsorbed material and what excreted. 

II. The Mode of Formation of the Digestive Secretions 

1. Salivary Glands. — The secretion from the various glands 
is generally evoked by nervous impulses, through the secretory 
nerves. K. Ludwig found that the stimulation of the chorda 
tympani produced a copious flow of watery saliva from the 
submaxillary gland, and a general dilatation of the blood-vessels 
supplying the gland. The same is the case in the sublingual 
gland. In addition to the chorda tympani fibres also pass to 
the gland through the cervical sympathetic, and when these 
are stimulated the saliva excreted is viscous and turbid, and 
contains much solid matter, while the blood-vessels are con- 
tracted. The conclusion formerly drawn was that the flow of 
saliva was dependent on the increased blood supply. But it 
has been definitely proved that true secretory fibres exist. If 
atropine be administered before stimulation of the chorda 
tympani, the dilatation of the vessels takes place, but no flow 
of saliva. Further, if the circulation be cut off from the gland 
the stimulation of the chorda tympani may cause a temporary 
flow of saliva. 

The parotid gland is supplied by the auriculo-temporal nerve which 
receives its secreting fibres from the glossopharyngeal. Stimulation 
of these fibres brings about an abundant watery secretion poor in 
solids. Stimulation of the sympathetic fibres system is not followed 
by any salivary flow, yet it has an effect on the gland, for, if after the 
sympathetic has been stimulated a secretion be evoked by stimula- 
tion of the glossopharyngeal nerve, the saliva secreted is very rich in 
organic solids. 

2. Gastric Glands. — The control of the gastric secretion seems 
to be under two entirely different mechanisms. Pawlow has 
clearly shown that the stomach is supplied with secretory nerves 
which reach that organ through the vagus. The stimuli which 
bring these nerves into action are the sight, the odour or the taste 
of food. That the course of the stimulus is through the vagus 
is shown by the fact that an abundant flow of juice may be caused 
so long as the vagi are intact, but this flow does not take place 
when these nerves are cut. Between the stimulation and the 
secretion there is a lengthy latent time amounting to several 
minutes. The other stimulus of the secretion is apparently a 
chemical one. Pawlow states that mechanical stimulation of 
the mucous membrane fails to bring about a flow of juice, but 
Beaumont in his classical observation on the stomach of St 
Martin found that the insertion of a tube did cause a flow. There 
may be certain substances either present in the food or developed 
in the course of digestion, which directly stimulate the secretion 
originally started by a nervous reflex. E. Starling has drawn 
attention to this chemical mode of stimulating different organs. 
To the substances known and unknown which evoke the action, 
he gives the name of hormones, and such " hormone " action 
he does not limit merely to the secretory organs but extends 
to all cases where one organ is stimulated by chemical products 
formed in the same or another organ. Attention has already 
been drawn to the influence of different food-stuffs on the amount 
and nature of the gastric secretion. 

3. Pancreatic Secretion. — The stimuli which evoke this secre- 
tion are again two in number. Many have failed to demonstrate 
that the secretion of the pancreas is under nervous control, but 
Pawlow and his school have shown that stimulation of the vagus 
evokes a secretion of pancreatic juice. This flow, as in the case 
of the stomach, has a latent period of several minutes. Most 
modern workers hold that the most effective stimulus to the 
pancreatic flow is the chemical one — a hormone discovered by 
W. Bayliss and E. Starling, who found that extracts of the 
duodenal mucous membrane made with dilute hydrochloric 
acid when injected into the blood caused a flow of pancreatic 
juice. The active substance present in this extract is known as 
" secretin," and is supposed to be formed under natural conditions 
by the action of the acid chyme on a prosecretin. This secretin 
is not of the ordinary zymin nature, as it is not destroyed by 
boiling and is soluble in alcohol. The secretin when formed 
must be absorbed into the blood and then carried round the 
circulation to the pancreas before it can act. 

4. Intestinal Juice. — The mode of action of the stimuli which 
evoke this secretion has not yet been fully investigated. As 
has been stated, it is quite possible that very little ferment is 
secreted, and that ferment action mainly takes place within 
the cells after the various substances have been absorbed. 
How far the flow is controlled by nervous action, and how far 
by hormone action, is not known. 

III. Motor Mechanism or the Alimentary Canal 

Mastication. — This is a purely voluntary act, and consists of 
a great variety of movements produced by the various muscles in 
connexion with the lower jaw. By the act of chewing the food 
is thoroughly broken up and intimately mixed with the saliva. 

Deglutition. — The food after thorough mastication is collected 
on the surface of the tongue, principally by the action (voluntary) 
of the buccinator muscles, and by the contraction of the tongue 
muscles it is passed backwards. As soon as the food by the 
action of the tongue enters the pillars of the fauces the action 
becomes involuntary and reflex. The soft palate is raised to 
prevent the food entering the nasal cavity, and the larynx 
is shut off by closure of the glottis, and approximation of the 
arytenoid cartilages to one another and to the back of the 
epiglottis. The food is now passed on into the oesophagus 
proper by the constrictors of the pharynx. In the oesophagus 
the downward movement varies with the nature of the food 
swallowed. If it be fluid it reaches the lower end of the oeso- 
phagus in about three seconds and lies at the lower end of the 
gullet for two or* three seconds before entering the stomach. 
When the consistency is firmer the progress downwards is much 
slower. Either by the force exerted by the wave of contraction 
passing down the gullet or by some inhibition of the sphincter, 
the cardiac orifice opens and permits the food to enter the 
stomach. 

Stomach Movements. — For our knowledge of these we are 
indebted principally to the work of Cannon, who studied them 
by feeding an animal with food containing bismuth and then 
following the movements of the shadow of the food on a screen by 
means of the X-rays. Soon after food is taken it is found that 
a contraction begins somewhere about the middle of the stomach 
and slowly passes towards the pylorus. This is followed by 
others, in man at regular intervals of about twenty seconds, so 
that the pyloric part of the organ is soon in active peristalsis. 
The fundus of the stomach is not actively concerned in these 
movements; it simply acts as a reservoir. At certain periods, 
but not with each peristaltic wave, the pyloric sphincter relaxes 
and allows a portion of the fluid acid chyme to escape into the 
duodenum. It only opens when stimulated by fluid material; 
if solid food be forced against it it remains tightly closed. 
Griitzner, by experiments with feeding with different coloured 
foods, has shown that the food at the fundus may remain un- 
disturbed for quite prolonged periods. In this connexion it 
must be remembered, of course, that the food is not lying loose 
in a sack larger than the contents. The cavity of the stomach 
is only the size of the amount of food present; in other words, 
the food exactly fills the cavity. The motor nerve fibres to the 
stomach run in the vagi, which also contain fibres inhibitory to 
the cardiac sphincter. The splanchnic nerves mainly contain 
inhibitory fibres. The automatic movements are probably in 
connexion with the intrinsic plexus of Auerbach, since they con- 
tinue after section of the extrinsic nerves. 

Intestinal Movements. — The intestines owe their peculiar 
movements to the arrangement of their muscular coats, which 
are disposed in two layers, an inner circular, and an outer longi- 
tudinal. The movements are of two kinds, the so-called swaying 
myogenic contraction and the peristaltic waves. The former 
are rapid and have very little to do with the downward movement 
of the contents. Probably their action is to mix the contents, 
since Cannon has shown that these contents, in the lower animals 
at least, get divided into segments. From time to time the 
separated segments are caught in the course of a peristaltic 
wave and carried downward a short distance. Then again in 
their new situation the rhythmic contractions break up the 
contents anew. 

The peristaltic movements are much more powerful. Under 
normal conditions they begin at the pylorus and passing down- 
wards carry the intestinal contents onwards. The normal 
movement progresses slowly, although under abnormal conditions 
peristaltic waves may become extremely violent and rapid, and 
may indeed run over the whole length of the intestine within a 
minute. The muscular coat in front of the contracting zone is 
relaxed, as is that behind the wave. The waves are probably 
due mainly to the circular fibres, the longitudinal pulling the 
gut up over the contents as they are forced onwards. The 
downward movement seems to be due to some definite arrange- 
ment within the intestinal wall, since it has been shown that, 
when a segment of bowel has been cut out and then the continuity 
of the canal made good by fixing the section so that the lower 
end of the excised portion is fixed to the upper divided end of the 
real gut, upward peristalsis takes place in this segment. An 
anti-peristalsis has been described in which the movements 
are all towards the stomach. Under certain conditions the 
introduction of foreign substances, as hairs, &c., may evoke such 
anti-peristaltic waves. 

The rhythmical movements are held by some to be purely 
myogenic in origin, as they still continue after section of all the 
nerves and when the intrinsic ganglia in the intestinal wall have 
been thrown out of action by the application of nicotine. But 
recent work by R. Magnus would tend to show that they are 
controlled by Auerbach's plexus. Peristaltic waves, on the 
other hand, according to W. Bayliss and E. Starling, although 
they continue and indeed may become more energetic after 
section of the extrinsic nerves, are prevented by the application 
of nicotine and cocaine; in other words, it is presumed that 
peristalsis is a complicated reflex action through the intrinsic 
ganglia. The intestines are therefore not dependent for their 
movement on their connexion with the central nervous system, 
although of course their activity is more or less regulated by 
such a connexion. 

As regards the movements of the large intestine, they resemble 
those of the small, although they are much less frequent. The 
forward movement is slow, thus permitting of the solidification 
of the contents by the removal of the water. In the first part 
of the large intestine anti-peristaltic movements are frequent, 
the regular peristaltic downward movements only becoming 
prominent when the descending colon is reached to carry contents 
to the rectum. The anti-peristalsis serves a useful purpose in 
giving time for the absorption of the fluid in the formation of 
faeces. The rate at which the contents travel along the intestine 
varies greatly.' Under average conditions the food residue 
reaches the ileo-caecal valve between the small and large intes- 
tine at about four to four and a half hours after a meal, while 
it takes nine hours to reach the splenic flexure of the colon. 

Defaecation. — Food residues, cellular debris and substances derived 
from the various secretions of the gastro-intestinal tract are forced 
downwards by peristalsis, and eventually reach the rectum and 
accumulate there as the faeces. The pressure of the solid and semi- 
solid mass gives rise to a definite sensation and a desire to empty the 
rectum. The faeces are retained within the canal partly by the 
horizontal direction of the rectum before it opens into the anal canal, 
and partly by the action of two sphincter muscles. At the act of 
defaecation the strong internal sphincter is first of all relaxed, but 
unless the rectal stimulus is very strong, the external can be kept 
contracted, as it is toa certain extent, under the control of the will. 
The act of defaecation normally is partly voluntary and partly 
involuntary. The voluntary part consists in the contraction of the 
abdominal muscles, the closure of the glottis, and the relaxation of 
the external sphincter and of the levator ani muscle, thus allowing 
the horizontal part of the rectum to become more vertical; the 
involuntary in trie energetic contractions of the muscular walls of the 
colon and rectum which sweep the contents of the whole colon 
downwards. There is a centre in the^ lumbar enlargement of the 
spinal cord which presides over the sphincter muscles and probably 
over the whole involuntary mechanism of defaecation. 

Vomiting. — Sometimes the gastric contents are ejected through 
the cardiac opening of the stomach instead of through the pylorus. 
The apt is a reflex one, probably originally protective in nature, 
irritation of the gastric mucous membrane being the most frequent 
cause. The act is generally preceded by a feeling of nausea and a 
copious salivation, succeeded by a series of powerful expiratory 
efforts with the glottis closed. The diaphragm is held firmly con- 
tracted, then a convulsive contraction of the abdominal muscles with 
a simultaneous opening of the cardiac orifice of the stomach brings 
about the sudden ejection of the contents. The wall of the stomach 
may also contract and press upon the contents. During the act the 
glottis is firmly closed, and at the same time, if the act be not too 
violent, the gastric contents are prevented from entering the nasal 
cavity by the contraction of the soft palate. 

IV. Absorption 

Mouth. — No absorption of food-stuffs takes place here. 

Stomach. — Absorption from the stomach occurs only to a small 
extent. Water passes rapidly through the stomach and is 
practically unabsorbed. Salts are apparently absorbed in a 
limited amount from their watery solution, the extent of absorp- 
tion depending to some extent on the concentration of the 
solution. Sugar is also absorbed to a small extent from its 
solutions, the greater the concentration the greater being the 
amount of sugar taken up. Alcohol is readily absorbed from the 
stomach. A small amount of the products of protein digestion 
may be absorbed. There is no evidence that fats are absorbed 
under any conditions in the stomach. 

Intestine. — The greatest absorption of the foods takes place in 
the intestine, especially in the small intestine. It has been shown 
that over 85% of the protein has disappeared before the lower 
end of the small intestine is reached. How does the absorption 
take place? There are two channels for the removal of the 
material from the intestine: (1) the blood capillaries spread 
in the villi, and (2) the lacteals also present in the villi. The 
foods may reach the blood direct or through the various lymph 
channels into the thoracic duct and finally into the blood. 
The lacteals of the villi are channels for the absorption of the 
fatty parts of the food. The products of the digestion of the 
proteins and carbohydrates reach the body directly through 
the capillaries via the portal system. 

Can absorption be explained by the ordinary laws of diffusion 
and osmosis, or are there certain selective activities of the living 
epithelial lining ? The work of R. Heidenhain, E. Weymouth 
Reid, and others shows clearly that whatever part the physical 
laws play in this exchange, there are other activities also at work. 
For instance, an animal's own serum can be readily absorbed 
from its intestine, as can also salt and other solutions of higher 
concentration than that of the blood. Such absorption cannot 
be explained by ordinary physical laws. In all such cases of 
absorption the epithelial lining of the gut must be intact and 
uninjured. O. Cohnheim and others have shown that when the 
epithelial lining is damaged or destroyed, the intestinal wall 
behaves like any other animal membrane, and the physical laws 
governing osmotic pressure come into play. Whether the nervous 
system plays any part in this absorption is not yet determined. 

The form in which the various products resulting from digestion 
are absorbed must next be considered. 

Carbohydrates. — These reach the body, as already mentioned, by 
way of the blood, and in the form of monosaccharides or simple 
sugars. F. Rohmann found that the absorption of the disaccharides 
is dependent on the invert ferment action, and not upon their osmotic 
characters. E. Weinland too has shown that if lactose be put into 
a lactase-free intestine, no absorption takes place, the lactose gradu- 
ally disappearing under bacterial action, whereas when the ferment 
lactase is present glucose and galactose the products of its splitting 
are absorbed as readily as cane-sugar and maltose. E. Voit has 
also demonstrated the fact that the body deals with its carbohydrate 
supply in the form of mono-saccharides. He injected solutions of 
various sugars, mono- and di-saccharides, and found that the simple 
sugars were retained, whereas the double sugars were excreted in the 
urine. The only di-saccharide which can be dealt with in the body 
is maltose, as there is a maltase present in the blood which splits it. 
Carbohydrates which are not absorbed from the intestine are dis- 
posed of by bacterial action, giving rise to various fatty acids, carbon 
dioxide, &c. 

Fats. -Fats are absorbed from the intestine in the form of fatty 
acids and glycerin ; i.e. in the form in which they exist after the 
action of the lipase. That a resynthesis takes place in the epithelium 
is shown by the fact that fatty acids are of equal value with fat as a 
source of energy, and that as fat absorption goes on fat droplets are 
seen to grow in the protoplasm away from the free margin of the cells. 
As already mentioned, the fat is removed by the lacteals from the 
cells to the thoracic duct, and then to the general circulation. A 
small amount of the fat may pass into the body via the blood, but 
this is practically all retained by the liver. The amount of fat 
absorbed depends a good deal on the nature of the fat, especially 
with reference to its melting-point, fats of low melting-point being 
most readily taken up. 

Protein. — The older workers held that the protein was absorbed in 
the form of proteose and peptone. In support of this it was stated 
that both proteoses and peptones could be detected in the blood 
stream. The result of the most recent work tends to show that the 
material is absorbed in the form of the amino acids either simple or in 
complex groups, the polypeptides, and that if proteoses or peptones 
be absorbed they are attacked by the intracellular enzyme erepsin, 
which breaks them down into the simpler products as soon as they 
are within the intestinal mucous membrane. Certain proteins appear 
to be absorbed unchanged ; for instance, blood serum disappears from 
the intestine without apparently any change through zymin attack. 
This fact is made use of in practical medicine, as, when administra- 
tion of food by the mouth is impossible, patients are frequently kept 
alive by the giving of nutrient enemata. That the food thus given is 
absorbed is shown by the increase of nitrogen excretion in the urine. 
In the large intestine very little absorption of nutrient matter takes 
place under normal conditions, mainly of course because most of the 
absorbable "material is removed whilst the food is in the small 
intestine. That protein matter can be absorbed is shown by the 
above statement regarding nutrient enemata. The principal sub- 
stance absorbed here is water; and thus the excreta become firm and 
formed. 

V. Metabolism 

In all living matter there is a constant cycle of chemical 
changes going on, a constant breaking down (catabolism), and a 
correspondingly constant building up (anabolism). Unless the 
former is covered by the latter wasting and finally death must 
supervene. These two changes together make up the metabolism, 
and the study of this involves a study of the fate of the food 
absorbed both when it is used immediately and after it has been 
stored in the tissues of the body. Protein matter is undoubtedly 
the main constituent of protoplasm, but in what form it exists 
there is absolutely unknown. One thing is certain, that for the 
maintenance of life a constant supply of protein matter is 
necessary. In fact it might be said that this is the essential 
food and keeps the body alive, fats and carbohydrates being 
merely subsidiary. In the mammalian organism with which we 
are specially concerned a supply of these latter substances is also 
necessary to yield the energy required. The amounts of these 
various food stuffs which should be present in a suitable diet are 
dealt with under Dietetics (q.v.). Here we are only concerned 
with the part played by the different materials in the various 
chemical changes which are the basis of vital activity. 

Not many years ago physiologists were very much in the 
position of unskilled labourers who saw loads of heterogeneous 
material being " dumped " for building purposes, but who did 
not know for what particular purpose each individual substance 
was used. Thanks, however, to the brilliant work of E. Fischer 
we are no longer in this position. Gradually our knowledge is 
being broadened by actual facts obtained by direct experiment, 
or by inference from previous experiments. But it is still far from 
complete. It is only possible to outline what is at present known 
about the part played by the different food constituents in 
metabolism. 

Proteins. — Since these alone contain the nitrogen necessary for 
the building up and repair of the tissues they are essential and will 
be dealt with first. In considering the digestion of proteins it was 
shown that in all probability all protein food was reduced in the 
intestine to comparatively simple crystalline bodies. O. Loewi has 
shown that an animal can be maintained in health without loss of 
weight by feeding it on a diet consisting of amino acids obtained by 
prolonged pancreatic digestion in place of proteins. In addition to 
these acids abundant carbohydrates and fats were given. It has 
since been shown that the presence of carbohydrate a certain amount 
of is absolutely essential before utilization of the amino acids can take 
place. Further, it has been demonstrated that only a mere fraction 
of the total amino acids resulting from pancreatic digestion is 
sufficient as the source of nitrogen supply for the animal organism. 
Not only so, but, in spite of the attempt to insist on the polypeptides 
as being the valuable nuclei for the rebuilding up of protein in the 
body, it has been shown that mixtures of amino acids from which the 
polypeptides have been removed can serve as the nitrogen supply. 

What then does the body gain by breaking down food material to 
such simple bodies, if it is immediately to be resynthesized ? This 
complete breakdown appears to be to facilitate rebuilding. The 
protein in the protoplasm of each animal is characteristic and to build 
up these different proteins the material must be separated into its 
nuclei. An experiment carried out by E. Abdcrhalden shows this 
very clearly. A protein gliadin absolutely different in constitution 
from the proteins of blood plasma was fed to an animal from which 
much of its blood had been removed, so that an active reformation 
had to take place. The question to be solved was whether by feeding 
with a protein so absolutely different in constitution the nature of the 
freshly forming serum protein could be radically changed. But the 
newly-formed serum was found to be exactly the same in constitution 
as^ the old. The tissues had selected simply those nuclei of the 
gliadin which were required and had rejected the others. 

In addition to this breakdown of protein in the intestine, another 
factor of importance comes into play. After absorption from the 
lumen of the gut the amino acids are not wholly conveyed as such by 
the portal blood to the liver. That the portal blood contains a 
greater amount of ammonia than the systemic blood has long been 
known, and Jacoby and Lang have shown that many tissues, and 
among them the intestinal tissues, are able to split off from the 
amino acids their amino group NH 2 . Thus it would seem probable 
that any excess of the amino acids formed does not reach the liver 
as such but denitrified as members of the fatty acid series. The 
ammonia split off is also conveyed to the liver and is excreted for the 
most part as urea, within the first few hours after a protein meal. 
Thus, in all probability very early after absorption and before the 
products of digestion enter into combination or any synthesis occurs, 
all excess of the absorbed nitrogen is disposed of. The rest of the 
products circulate in the blood, yielding to the cells the materials of 
which they are in need. On the other hand some investigators still 
hold that resynthesis into a neutral protein like scrum albumin takes 
place in the intestinal wall immediately after absorption of the digest 
products. That the leucocytes play an important part in carrying 
the products of protein digestion to the tissues is indicated by the 
enormous increase in their number which occurs during the digestion 
and absorption of protein foods. How they act, whether simply as 
carriers of the products of protein digestion combined or uncombined, 
and how they give the material to the tissues is unknown. 

Carbohydrates are generally assumed simply to serve the purpose 
of yielding energy in their combustion to C0 2 and H 2 0, and to act as 
protein sparers, i.e. they save the ingestion of large amounts of 
costly protein material as a source of energy. There may, however, 
be other activities in which the ingested sugars play a part, for 
instance^ in the utilization of the nitrogen of proteins. It has already 
been indicated that the nitrogen in the products of pancreatic diges- 
tion can be used only when a sufficient amount of carbohydrates is 
giyen at the same time. Only carbohydrates seem to be able to do 
this, for it has been found that when isodynamic amounts of fat are 
given the utilization does not take place. 

When taken into the body in excess of the immediate require- 
ments the sugar is not utilized all at once, but any excess is stored in 
the form of glycogen both in the liver and the muscles. This glycogen 
is an insoluble polysaccharide, and is only utilized according to the 
requirements of the body, especially during muscular exertion. 
Carbohydrates, when taken in in excessf are also stored in the tissues 
in the form of fat. This was demonstrated by the feeding experi- 
ments of Lawes and Gilbert at Rothamstead. They took two young 
pigs of a litter, killed arid analysed one, then fed the other for a 
definite time upon food of known composition, determining the 
amount of protein absorbed by analysing the urine and the faeces. 
They then killed the pig and by analysis ascertained the amount 
of fat put on. They found that this was far in excess of the amount 
of the protein of the food which had been absorbed and was also in 
excess of what could have been formed from the small amount of fat 
in the food. The fat must therefore have been formed from the 
carbohydrates of the food. The consumption of larger amounts of 
sugar than can be used or stored as glycogen results in its passing 
straight through the body and being excreted in the urine. This 
condition is known as alimentary glycosuria. The power of using 
and storing sugar varies greatly in different individuals and in the 
same individual at different times. 

Fats. — The fats simply serve as stores of energy. After ingestion, 
if in small amount, they are, like carbohydrates, oxidized to the same 
final products C0 2 , and H 2 0. If in larger amount they are stored as 
fat, to serve as a reserve in case of need, in the body tissues. Like 
the carbohydrates they serve as the sources of part of the energy 
dissipated asheat, but they are not so efficient as sparers of protein 
material, evidently in part at least because they are less easily 
digested and absorbed. 

Factors which influence Normal Metabolism. 

I. Fasting. — During fasting the body draws upon its own reserve 
of stored material for the requirements in the production of energy, 
and the rate of breakdown varies with the energy requirements. 
An individual who is kept warm in bed therefore stands fasting 
longer than one who is compelled to take exercise in a cold place. 
The breakdown of tissue during the early days of a fast is much 
greater than later, for as the fast progresses the body becomes more 
economical in its utilization of tissue. During a fast the tissues do 
not all waste at an equal rate; those which are not essential are 
utilized at a much greater rate than those which are essential to the 
maintenance of the organism. For instance, it has been shown that 
during a fast the skeletal muscles may lose over 40 % of their weight, 
whereas an essential organ like the heart loses only some 3 %. 

The essential tissues obtain their nourishment from the less 
essential probably by ferment action, a process which has been 
termed autolysis. The autolytic products of the stored material in 
the tissues are practically identical with those which arise during the 
ordinary gastro-intestinal digestion. 

2. Muscular Work. — The muscular tissue plays the most important 
pan in general metabolism. Not only is muscle the most abundant 
tissue present, but it is constantly active and is the great energy- 
liberating machine of the body. Formerly it was believed on the 
authority of Liebig that muscular work was done at the expense 
of the protein material, but it has been conclusively shown that 
the real source of energy in moderate work is the non-protein 
material, carbohydrates and^ fats; of these the former plays the 
greater part in a man on ordinary diet. If, however, the supply of 
non-nitrogenous material be insufficient, then the energy has to be 
supplied by the protein and the output of nitrogen is thus increased. 
Variations in the amount of creatinin and uric acid (both products 
of muscle metabolism) excreted have been described. In hard work 
it is sometimes found that there may be no immediate rise in the 
nitrogen output on the day of the work, but that an increase is 
manifest on the second or third day after. While the excretion of 
nitrogen shows no increase proportionate to the work done, the output 
of carbon dioxide produced by the combustion of the carbohydrates 
and of the fats is increased proportionately to the work done. 

3. Internal Secretions. — Evidence is accumulating to show that 
the activities of the various tissues of the body are presided over and 
controlled not merely by the action of the nervous system but 
also by chemical substances, the result of the activity of certain 
organs. To these chemical substances, as already stated, the name of 
hormones has been given. 

The hormone which has-been most thoroughly investigated is 
adrenalin, a perfectly definite chemical compound consisting of a 
secondary alcohol linked to a benzene ring. It is a product of the 
central or medullary part of the suprarenal bodies. The medullary 
part of these organs is developed from the sympathetic part of the 
nervous system, and adrenalin acts as a' stimulant to the termina- 
tions of the sympathetic nerves which spring from the thoraco- 
abdominal region. These nerves control the small arteries, and the 
main action of adrenalin is to cause a powerful contraction of these 
vessels, and as a result a great rise in the arterial blood pressure. 
For this purpose it is now largely used in medfcine. The constant 
supply or adrenalin in small quantities seems to play an important 
part in keeping up the tone of the blood vessels, and when, as a 
result of disease of the suprarenals, the supply is cut off a serious 
train of symptoms supervenes. 

Allied to adrenalin is a hormone derived from the pituitary body. 
This also causes a constriction of the small arteries except those of 
the kidney, which it dilates. An increased flow of urine is produced. 

In the thyroid gland a substance, iodothyrin, is constantly being 
produced, and this appears to exerciser stimulating action pn the 
rate of chemical exchange in the various tissues. Under its ad- 
ministration the waste of both proteins and fats is increased. When 
the thyroid is removed or destroyed by disease a condition of de- 
creased chemical change and mental sluggishness results, accom- 
panied often by nervous tremors. 

A difficulty in explaining these symptoms is caused by the fact 
that in the thyroid are imbedded four small parathyroids, and it is 
possible that these produce a special hormone. It 
has been suggested that this exercises a particular 
influence upon the nervous system, but further 
evidence is wanting. 

The well-known effects of removal of the 
ovaries or testes on the development and character 
of an animal is due to the absence of the special 
hormone or hormones of these structures. These 
hormones appear to be produced, in the case of 
the testes at least, not in the true genital cells, 
but in the intermediate cells, since jt has been 
found that ligature of the duct, which leads to 
destruction of the genital cells, does not abolish the development 
of the sexual characters of the animal. 

There is growing evidence that from the ovaries different hormones 
may be produced in varying amounts which play an important part 
in regulating the phenomena of sexual life. 

The thymus gland is a structure lying in the front of the neck, which 
is best developed at the time of birth, grows very slowly after birth, 
and atrophies when the age of puberty is reached. In castrated male 
animals it continues to grow and persists throughout life. There is 
some evidence that it may exercise some effect upon the growth of the 
testes, probably by hormone action. 

Pancreas. — Within recent years it has been shown that the internal 
secretion of this organ plays a very important part in the metabolism 
of sugar. When the organ is completely extirpated the animal 
becomes diabetic, i.e. sugar appears in the urine and the animal 
emaciates. How the internal secretion effects the combustion of 
the sugar is not yet known. Some workers hold that the action of 
the pancreatic internal secretion is to control the sugar formation in 
the various sugar-forming organs, of which the liver is the chief, 
others that it dominates the utilization of sugar as a source of 
energy by the muscles. 

These are some of the best-known examples* of the way in which 
the products of the activity of one organ modify the functions of 
other organs. In all probability many more examples of hormone 
action will be discovered, and it will be found that it plays probably 
even amore important part than the nervous system in the co- 
ordination of function in the animal. 

Other factors, besides these already dealt with, play a part in 
modifying the various metabolic processes, as age, temperature, 
climate, &c. Very little, however, is definitely known about these 
various factors. 

Water and inorganic salts are quite as essential for the well-being 
of the body as the energy-yielding proteins, carbohydrates and fats. 
They, however, probably undergo little or no change in the body; 
they are excreted pretty much in the same form in which they are 
ingested. Although they are not subjected to any very great change 
yet they are of immense importance. No animal tissue can carry on 
its work in the absence^ of the various salts. Many experiments have 
been carried out in which animals have been fed on food as free from 
salts as possible, and, although the food was much in excess of the 
energy requirements, yet all these animals died, whereas other 
animals to which similar food with salts was given throve well. The 
most important acids are hydrochloric and phosphoric, and the 
most important bases sodium of potassium. Calcium and magnesium 
are also of importance, especially where bone formation is taking 
place. Another element of really vital importance is iron, which is 
required for the formation of haemoglobin. 

VI. Excretion 

While we know comparatively little of the intermediate stages 
in the breakdown of the food constituents, and more particularly 
of the protein moiety, our knowledge of the final products of the 
metabolic changes excreted is fairly full. The urine is the main 
channel of excretion for the nitrogenous waste products. C0 2 , 
arising for the most part from the metabolism of carbohydrates 
and fats, is excreted mainly through the lungs. Water is excreted 
by the lungs, the kidneys and the skin. 

So far no entirely satisfactory explanation has been given of how a 
fluid like urine, having an acid reaction and containing about one 
hundred times as much urea and generally more than twice as much 
sodium chloride as the blood, is formed in the kidneys. The urine 
is a yellowish fluid which varies greatly in its depth of colour, from 
pale amber to a deep brown. It has a specific gravity of about 1020, 
varying with the percentage of solids in solution, and it usually has. 
an acid reaction. It is a fluid of complex character, containing, as 
already mentioned, practically all the waste nitrogen of the body. 
Among the principal organic substances present are urea, ammonia, 
purins (uric acid and the so-called purin bases, xanthin, &c), 
creatinin, conjugated sulphates, various aromatic bodies and many 
other substances in small amount, together with the water and 
inorganic salts. 

The following table from Folin gives a good idea of the average 
composition of the urine as regards the nitrogen-containing con- 
stituents, and its variation according to the nature of the diet when 
this is free of creatin creatinin and the precursors of the purins:--

4-2-11-7 % „ 
5*5-"*i % „ 
1-2- 2-4 % „ 
4-8-14-6 % „ 

Urea, which forms the chief nitrogenous constituent, amounting 
on an ordinary diet to about 30 grms. per diem, is for the most part 
formed in the liver, from ammonia obtained either directly from the 
blood after absorption from the intestine, or resulting from the 
denitrificatjon of the amino acids. It may also arise in part from the 
diamino acids and from uric acid. 

Ammonia is present in the form of ammonium salts, and forms 
about 4% of the totalurinary nitrogen. It may exceed this amount 
under certain conditions, for the most part pathological. The 
ammonia is utilized by the body to neutralize acids which arise 
during the various metabolic processes. 

Purins^ (uric acid, xanthin, hypoxanthin, &c.) are all members of. a 
series which have as their common nucleus a body which E. Fischer 
called purin. The most important member of this series is uric acid. 
It forms about 2 % of the total urinary nitrogen. Recent work has 
shown that it has two quite definite sources of origin: (1) from 
ingested food containing the precursors, and (2) from the tissue 
metabolism. The first is known as the exogenous source, and the 
second as the endogenous. This acid is chemically known as tri- 
oxy-purin, and may be regarded as the union of two urea molecules 
with a three-carbon chain fatty acid. All the uric acid formed in the 
body isnot excreted as such, part being, as already mentioned, con- 
verted into urea. The amount which is converted into urea varies 
with the species of animal. In man, Burian and Schur state that one 
half of the total amount is so converted. Some workers, like Wiener, 
hold that uric acid may be synthesized in the body, but while this is 
undoubtedly so in the case of the bird, in the mammal it has not been 
definitely established. The other chief purin bodies present in urine 
are xanthin and hypoxanthin, purins less oxidized than uric acid ; 
the first is a dioxypurin, and the second is a monoxypurin. The 
main source of total purin supply would seem to be muscle rneta- 
bolism. The mother substances from which all are derived in the 
body are the nucleins. These complex bodies are apparently first 
broken down by enzyme action to aminopurins. These in their turn 
have their amino groups split off , and then, according to the degree 
of oxidation, the different purin bodies are formed. 

Creatinin. — The physiological significance of this substance 
is as yet unknown. The daily excretion varies little with the 
character of the diet, provided, of course, that the diet be creatin 
creatinin free. It appears to be proportional to the muscular de- 
velopment and muscular activity of the individual. Hence it would 
seem to be derived from the creatin of muscle, a substance which is 
very readily changed into creatinin outside the body. In the body 
the conversion of creatin into creatinin seems to be strictly limited, 
and hence when creatin is taken in flesh in the food it tends to appear 
as such in the urine. It would seem that it is either in great 
part decomposed in the body into what we do not at present know 
or that, as suggested by Fohn, it may be used as a specialized food. 
Whatever its source, after urea and ammonia it is one of the most 
important nitrogenous substances excreted, the daily excretion 
being about 1*5 grms. 

The sulphur excreted in the urine comes chiefly from the sulphur 
of the protein molecule. It is excreted in various forms. (1) As 
the ordinary preformed sulphates, that is, sulphur in the form of 
sulphuric acid combined with the ordinary bases. (2) As ethereal 
sulphates, that is, in combination with various aromatic substances 
like phenol, indol, &c. (3) In the form of so-called neutral sulphur in 
such substances as cystin, which are intermediate products in the 
complete oxidation of sulphur. 

Phosphorus^ appears linked to the alkalis and alkaline earths as 
phosphoric acid. A very small part of the phosphoric acid may be 
eliminated in organic combination such as the glycerophosphates, &c. 

Sodium (mostly as sodium chloride), potassium, calcium and 
magnesium are the common bases present in the urine. 

The lungs are the important channel of excretion for the waste 
product of carbon metabolism CO2 (see Respiratory System); and 
also a very important channel for the excretion of water. As regards 
the skin, the sweat carries off a large amount of the water, but it is 
difficult to determine the total amount. It has been estimated that 
about 500 c.c. is excreted per diem under normal conditions. 
Sweat contains salts, chiefly sodium chloride, and organic waste 
products. ^ Of the organic solids excreted from this source urea forms 
the most important under normal conditions. Under pathological 
conditions, especially when there is interference with free renal 
action, the amount of nitrogenous waste excreted may become quite 
important. There is also a small amount of CO2 excreted by this 
channel. (D. N. P.; E. P. Cl) 


NUTTALL, THOMAS (1 786-1859), English botanist and orni- 
thologist, who b'ved and worked in America from 1808 until 1842, 
was born at Settle in Yorkshire on the 5th of January 1786, 
and spent some years as a journeyman printer in England. Soon 
after going to the United States he was induced by Professor 
B. S. Barton (1766-1815) to apply himself to the study of the 
plants of that country. In 182 5-1 834 he was curator of 
the botanic gardens of Harvard university. In 1834 he crossed 
the continent to the Pacific Ocean, and visited the Hawaiian 
Islands. Some property having been left him in England on 
condition of his residing on it during part of each year, he left 
America in 1842, and did not again revisit it except for a short 
time in 1852. He died at St Helens, Lancashire, on the 10th of 
September 1859. 

Almost the whole of his scientific work was done in the United 
States, and his published works appeared there. The more im- 
portant of these are, The Genera of North American Plants, and 
a Catalogue of the Species to the year 1817 (2 vols., 1818); Journal 
of Travels into the Arkansas Territory during tlie year 181Q (1821); 
The North American Sylva: Trees not described by F. A. Michaux (3 
vols., 1842-1849); Manual of the Ornithology of the United States 
and of Canada (1832 and 1834); and numerous papers in American 
scientific periodicals. 


NUWARA ELIYA, a town and sanatorium of Ceylon. Pop. 
(1901) 5026, with 1000 additional visitors during the season. 
It is situated 6240 ft. above sea-level, with the highest mountain 
in the island, Pedrotallagaila, towering over the plain for 2056 ft. 
more. Nuwara Eliya is reached from Colombo by railway, 
eight hours to Namuoya, and thence, by a light sHt.-gauge line, 
running up to the heart of the sanatorium. The average shade 
temperature for the year is 58 F. ; the rainfall, 95 in. Considerable 
sums have been spent by the government in improving the place. 


NUX VOMICA, a poisonous drug, consisting of the seed of 
Strychnos Nux-Vomica, a tree belonging to the natural order 
Loganiaceae, indigenous to most parts of India, and found also 
in Burma, Siam, Cochin China and northern Australia. The 
tree is of moderate size, with a short, thick, often crooked, stem, 
and ovate entire leaves, marked with three to five veins radiating 
from the base of the leaf. The flowers are small, greenish-white 
and tubular, and are arranged in terminal corymbs. The fruit 
is of the size of a small orange, and has a thin hard shell, enclosing 
a bitter, gelatinous white pulp, in which from 1 to 5 seeds are 
vertically embedded. The seed is disk-shaped, rather less than 
1 in. in diameter, and about J in. in thickness, slightly depressed 
towards the centre, and in some varieties furnished with an acute 
keel-like ridge at the margin. The external surface of the seed 
is of a greyish-green colour and satiny appearance, due to a 
coating of appressed silky hairs. The interior of the seed consists 
chiefly of horny albumen, which is easily divided along its outer 
edge into halves by a fissure, in which lies the embryo. The 
latter is about -^5- in. long, and has a pair of heart-shaped 
membranous cotyledons. 

The chief constituents of the seeds are the alkaloids strychnine 
(q.v.) and brucine, the former averaging about 0-4%, and the 
latter about half this amount. The seeds also contain an acid, 
strychnic or igasuric acid; a glucoside, loganin; sugar and fat. 
The dose of the seeds is 1 to 4 grains. The British Pharmacopoeia 
contains three preparations of nux vomica. The liquid extract 
is standardized to contain 1*5% of strychnine; the extract 
is standardized to contain 5%; and the tincture, which is 
the most widely used, is standardized to contain 0-25%. 

The pharmacology of nux vomica is practically that of strychnine. 
The tincture is chiefly used in cases of atonic dyspepsia, and is 
superior to all other bitter tonics, in that, it is antiseptic and has a 
more powerful action upon the movements of the gastric wall. The 
extract is of great value in the treatment of simple constipation. 


NYACK, a village of Rockland county, New York, U.S.A., 
in the town of Orangetown, on the western bank of the Hudson 
river, about 25 m. north of New York City. Pop. (1890) 4rii; 
(1900) 4275, of whom 583 were foreign-born; (1905) 4441; (1910) 
4619. Nyack is served, by the Northern Railroad of New Jersey 
(a branch of the Erie), and is connected by ferry with Tarry town, 
nearly opposite, on the eastern bank of the Hudson. The New 
York, Ontario & Western and the West Shore railways pass 
through West Nyack, a small village about 2 m. west. For 
about 2 m. above and 3 m. below Nyack the river expands into 
Tappan Zee or Bay, which is about 3 m. wide immediately 
opposite the village. The first grant of land within the present 
limits of Nyack was made by Governor Philip Carteret, of New 
Jersey, to one Claus Jansen, in 1671, but the permanent settle- 
ment apparently dates from about 1 700. The adjacent villages 
of Upper Nyack, pop. (1905) 648, (1910) 591, and South 
Nyack, pop. (1910) 2068, form with Nyack practically one com- 
munity. Nyack was named from a tribe of Algonquian Indians. 

See David Cole, History of Rockland county, (New York, 1884). 


NYANZA (from the ancient Bantu root word ansa, a river or 
lake), the Bantu name for any sheet or stream of water of con- 
siderable size; especially applied to the great lakes of east 
Central Africa. The word is variously spelt, and the form 
" Nyasa " has become the proper name of a particular lake. 
Nyanza is the spelling used in designating the great lakes which 
are the main reservoirs of the river Nile. 


NYASA, the third in size of the great lakes of Central Africa, 
occupying the southern end of the great rift-valley system which 
traverses the eastern half of the equatorial region from north to 
south. Extending from 9 29' to 14 25' S., or through nearly 
5° of latitude, the lake measures along its major axis, which is 
slightly inctined to the west of north, exactly 350 m., while the 
greatest breadth, which occurs near the middle of its length,, 
between ii° 30' and 12 20' S., is 45 m. In the northern and 
southern thirds of the length the breadth varies generally from 
20 to 30 m., and the total area may be estimated at 1 1,000 sq. m. 

The lake lies at an altitude of about 1650 ft. above the sea. 
The sides cf the valley in which Nyasa lies, which are somewhat 
irregular towards its southern end, take a decided character cf 
fault scarps in the northern third, and are continued as such 
beyond the northern extremity. Apart from the recent alluvium 
on the immediate shores, the lake lies almost entirely in granite 
and gneiss formations, broken, however, by a band of horizontally- 
bedded sandstones, which cuts the axis of the lake in about 
io° 30' S., the flat-topped, terraced form of the latter contrasting 
strangely with the jagged or rounded outlines of the former. 
Near the margin, overlying the sandstones, there are beds of 
limestone with remains of recent molluscs, pointing, like the 
raised beaches which occur elsewhere, to an upward movement 
of the coasts. Lacustrine deposits up to 700 ft. above the present 
lake-level have been discovered. Geologically, the lake is believed 
to be of no great age, a view supported by topographical evidence. 
The depth of the lake seems to va/y in accordance with the 
steepness of the shores, increasing from south to north. The 
greater part of the northern half shows depths of over 200 fathoms, 
while a maximum of 430 fathoms was obtained by Mr. J. E. S. 
Moore in 1899, off the high western coast in about n° 40' S. 
A more complete series of soundings, however, since made by 
Lieut. Rhoades, and published in the Geographical Journal in 
1902, gives a maximum of 386 fathoms off the same coast in 
ii° 10' S. The lake receives its water-supply chiefly from the 
streams which descend from the mountains to the north, all 
the rest becoming very small in the dry season. Like other 
lakes of Central Africa it is subject to fluctuations of level, 
apparently caused by alternations of dry and wet series of years. 

At the north-western end is a plain of great fertility, traversed 
by the Kivira, Songwe and other streams, rising either among the 
volcanic masses to the north or on the western plateau. Just 
north of io° S. on the delta oi the Rukuru, is the British station of 
Karonga, the northern port of call for the lake steamers, though 
with but an open roadstead. Southwards the plain narrows, and in 
about ioi° S. the sandstone scarp of Mount Waller rises sheer above 
the indentation of Florence Bay, the high western plateaus continuing 
to fall steeply to the water in wooded cliffs for more than 80 m. 
In this stretch occur the land-locked bays of Ruarwe (1 1 ° 5' S.) 
and Nkata (n° 36' S.), and the mouth of the Rukuru (io ^' S)., 
which drains the plateau from south to north. At Cape Chirombo 
(1 1° 40' S.) the coast bends to the west, and soon the plateau escarp- 
ments recede, and are separated from the lake along its southern half 
by an undulating plain of varying width. In n° 56' S. is the British 
station of Bandawe, and in 12 55' that of Kota Kota, on a lake-like 
inlet, forming a sheltered harbour, A little north of the latter the 
Bua river, coming from a remote source on the upper plateau, enters 
by a projecting delta. At Domira Bay, in 13 35', the coast turns 
suddenly east, contracting the lake to a comparatively narrow neck, 
with the British stations of Fort Rifu on the west, and Fort Maguire, 
near the headland of Makanjira Point, on the east. Beyond this 
the Jake runs southwards into two bays separated by a granitoid 
peninsula, off which He several small rocky islands. On this peninsula 
was placed the mission station of Livingstonia, the first to be 
established on the shores of Nyasa. From the extremity of the eastern 
bay the Shir6 makes its exit to the Zambezi. On the eastern side the 
plateau escarpments keep generally close to the lake, leaving few 
plains of any extent along its shores. The crest of the eastern water- 
shed runs generally parallel to... the shore, which it approaches in 
places within 20 m. From the north point to io° 30' S. the coast is 
formed by the unbroken wall of the Livingstone or Kinga range, 
rising where highest (9 41' S.) fully 6000 ft. above the water. ■ On 
this coast, on a projecting spit of land, is the German station of 
Old Laneenburg, some 10 m, from the northern extremity. In 
io° 30' the plateau is broken by the valley of the Ruhuhu, the only 
important stream which enters the lake from the east. The forma- 
tion is here sandstone, corresponding to that of Mount Waller on the 
opposite shore. Just north of the Ruhuhu is the German station of 
Wiedhafen, on an excellent harbour, formerly Amelia Bay. South 
of the Ruhuhu the wall of mountains recedes somewhat, and the 
remainder of the^ eastern shore shows a variation between rocky 
cliffs, marshy plains of restricted area and groups of low hills. In 
1 1 ° 16' is the deep inlet of Mbampa Bay, offering a sheltered anchor- 
age. South of it the coast forms a wide semicircular bay, generally 
rock-bound,and ending south in Malo Point (1 2° 10' S.), off which are 
the largest islands the lake possesses, Likoma and Chisamulu, the 
former measuring about 4 m. by 3. In the southern half the coast is 
highest in about 13 10' S., where the Mapangi hills rise to 3000 ft. 

Nyasa, reached in 1859 both by David Livingstone (from 
the south) and by the German traveller Albrecht Roscher (from 
the east), was explored by the former to about n°, and to its 
northern end by E. D. Young in 1876. From this date onwards 
it has been the scene of much civilizing work on the part of 
British [(principally Scottish) missionaries, traders and govern- 
ment officials, and, in more recent years, of Germans also. Its 
shores have been divided between Great Britain, Portugal 
and Germany, Great Britain holding (within the British Nyasa- 
land Protectorate) all the west coast south of the Songwe, and 
the southern extremity of the east coast (south of 13^° S.); 
Portugal the rest of the east coast south of n|° S.; and Germany 
the remainder. British steamers, including two or three gun- 
boats, have been launched on Nyasa, which forms an important 
link in the water-route from the Zambezi mouth to the heart 
of the continent. Germany also has a gunboat on the lake. The 
first detailed survey of its shores was executed by Dr James 
Stewart (1876-1877), but this has been superseded* by later 
work, especially that of Lieuts. Rhoades and Phillips.

NYBORG, a seaport of Denmark on the east side of the island 
of Fiinen, in the ami (county) of Svendborg, and the point from 
which the ferry crosses the Great Belt to Korsor in Zealand 
(15 m.). Pop. (1901) 7790. The fortress, built by Christian IV. 
and Frederick III., was dismantled in 1869, and the ruins of 
the castle are used as a prison. In the 12th century the town 
was founded and a castle erected on Knudshoved (Canute's 
Head) by Knud, nephew of Waldemar the Great; and from the 
13th to the 15th century Nyborg was one of the most important 
places in Denmark. In 1658 it surrendered to the Swedes; 
but by the defeat of the latter under the walls of the fortress 
on the 24th of November 1659, the country was freed from 
their dominion. In 1808 the Marquis La Romana, who with 
a body of Spanish troops garrisoned the fortress for France, 
revolted from his allegiance, and held out till he and a portion 
of his men escaped with the English fleet. 


NYCKELHARPA (Swed. nyckel = key, harpa = harp; Ger. 
Schliisselfiedel), a kind of bowed hurdy-gurdy, much used in 
Scandinavia during the late middle ages, and still in use in some 
parts of Sweden. It consists of a body some 2 ft. long, shaped 
like an elongated viol, with sloping shoulders and highly arched 
sound-board glued over a less arched back, and ribs cut out of a 
single block of wood. There is no fingerboard, but along the 
neck, arranged like frets, are a number of keys or wooden 
tangents, which when pressed inwards bring a little knob or stud 
into contact with the first string of thin catgut, thus stopping 
it and raising the pitch as in the hurdy-gurdy. At three points 
these keys also act upon the third string. There are in the 
comparatively modern instruments usually four melody strings 
of catgut and three drones of fine spun wire. The bridge is 
quite flat, so that when the bow is passed over the strings, they 
all sound at once. The tailpiece is very long, extending over 
half the length of the body, and the two oval sound-holes, far 
removed from the strings, are at the tail end of the instrument. 


NYE, EDGAR WILSON (1850-1896), American humorist, 
was born at Shirley, Maine, on the 25th of August 1850. His 
parents removed to a farm on the St Croix river in northern 
Wisconsin in 1852, and young Nye was educated in Wisconsin 
at the academy at River Falls, where he studied law. In 1876 
he was admitted to the bar at Laramie, Wyoming, where he 
served as justice of the peace, superintendent of schools, member 
of the city council and postmaster. Here he began to contribute 
humorous articles under the pseudonym of "Bill Nye " to news- 
papers, especially the Cheyenne Sun and the Denver Tribune. In 
1881 he founded at Laramie the Boomerang, and his reputation 
as a humorist was soon widespread. Later he became a success- 
ful lecturer, and in 1885, with James Whitcomb Riley, the 
poet, made an extended tour through the country, each reading 
from his own writings. Nye removed to New York City in 1886, 
and passed the later years of his life at Arden, a village in Bun- 
combe county, North Carolina (about 10 m. south of Asheville), 
where he died on the 22nd of February 1896. His principal 
books are Bill Nye and Boomerang (1881); Forty Liars and 
Other Lies (1882); Nye and Riley's Railway Guide (1886), with 
James Whitcomb Riley; and two comic histories, Bill Nye's 
History of the United States (1894) and Bill Nye's History of 
England from the Druids to the Reign of Henry VIII. (1896). 


NYEZHIN or Nezhin, a town of Russia, in the government 
of Chernigov, 62 m. by rail S.E. of the town of Chernigov and 
79 m. N.E. of Kiev, on the railway between Kursk and Kiev. The 
old town is built on the left bank of the (canalized) river Oster, and 
its suburbs, Novoye-Myesto and Magerki, on the right. It has an 
old cathedral, a technical school and a former high school (lyceum 
of Bezborodko, at which N. V. Gogol, the novelist, was a student), 
now transformed into a philological institute. The inhabitants 
(33,000), are mostly Little-Russians and Jews; there are also some 
Greeks, descendants of those who immigrated in the 17th century 
at the invitation of the Cossack chieftain Bogdan Chmielnicki. 

Unyezh, which is supposed to have been the former name of 
Nyezhin, is mentioned as early as 1147. At that time it belonged 
to the principality of Chernigov; afterwards it fell under the 
rule of Poland. It was ceded to Russia about 1500, but again 
became a Polish possession after the treaty of Deulina (1619) 
between Poland and Russia. In 1649, after the revolt of Little 
Russia and its liberation from the Polish rule, Nyezhin was 
the chief town of one of the most important Cossack regiments. 
It was annexed to Russia in 1664. 


NYIREGYHAZA, the capital of the county of Szabolcs, in 
Hungary, 169 m. E.N.E. of Budapest by rail. Pop. (1900) 
31,875. It is a busy railway junction, and its inhabitants are 
engaged in agriculture, wine-growing and the manufacture 
of soda, matches and saltpetre. About 20 m. to the N.W. lies 
the famous wine-producing district of Tokaj (Tokay). 


NYKJOBING, a seaport of Denmark, in the amt -(county) 
of Maribo,onthe west shore of the island of Falster, 94 m. S.S.W. 
of Copenhagen by rail. Pop. (1901) 7345. Its church contains 
a genealogical tree of the Mecklenburg ducal family, with por- 
traits, dating from 1627 or earlier. Here is the house occupied 
by Peter the Great of Russia in 1716, restored in 1898. A 
railway runs south to Gjedser (14 m.), from which the sea-passage 
(29 m.) to Warnerniinde links the fastest route between Copen- 
hagen and Berlin. 

Other towns of the name of Nykjobing in Denmark are (1) on 
Limfjord in Thisted amt (pop. 4492); and (2) in Zealand, Holbaek 
amt (pop. 2000). 


NYKOPING, a seaport of Sweden, chief town of the district 
(l&n) of Sodermanland, 98 m. S.W. of Stockholm by a branch 
from the Stockholm-Malmo railway. Pop. (1900) 7375. It 
lies at the head of the Byfjord, an inlet of the Baltic. The ruins 
of its once famous castle, the town hall (1662), and the district 
governor's residence, are notable buildings. The port, together 
with that of Oxelosund (10 m. S.E.) at the mouth of the bay, 
which is seldom closed in winter, exports iron and zinc ere, 
timber, wood-pulp and oats. 

Nykoping (i.e. New-Market, Latinized as Nicopia) begins to 
appear as a town early in the 13th century. Its castle was the 
seat of the kings of Sodermanland, and after those of Stockholm 
and Kalmar was the strongest in Sweden. The death of Walde- 
mar in 1293, the starving to death of Dukes Waldemar and 
Eric in 1318, the marriage and the deaths both of Charles IX. 
and his consort Christina of Holstein, the birth of their daughter 
Princess Catherine and in 1622 the birth of her son Charles X. 
are the main incidents of which it was the scene. Burned down 
in 1665 and again damaged by fire in r7i9, it still remained 
tfie scat of the provincial authorities till 1760. The town was 
burned by Albert of Mecklenburg's party in 1389, by an accidental 
conflagration in 1665, and by the Russians in 17 19. 


NYLSTROOM, a town of the Transvaal, South Africa, capital 
of the Waterberg district, and 8r m. N. of Pretoria by rail; 
altitude 4250 ft. Pop. (1904) 599. It was founded about r86o 
and owes its name to the belief of the early Boer trekkers that 
the river which they had discovered was the head stream of the 
Nile. The Waterberg gold-fields are 20 m. N.N.E. of the town. 


NYMPHAEUM (Gr. vvii<j>aiov y vvy.<j>olov) y m Greek and Roman 
antiquities, a monument consecrated to the nymphs (q.v.) y 
especially those of springs. These monuments were originally 
natural grottoes, which tradition assigned as habitations to the 
local nymphs. They were sometimes so arranged as to furnish 
a supply of water. Subsequently, artificial took the place of 
natural grottoes. The nymphaea of the Roman period were 
borrowed from the constructions of the Hellenistic east. The 
majority of them were rotundas, and were adorned with statues 
and paintings. They served the threefold purpose of sanctuaries, 
reservoirs and assembly-rooms. A special feature was their 
use for the celebration of marriages. Such nymphaea existed 
at Corinth, Antioch and Constantinople; the remains of some 
twenty have been found at Rome and of many in Africa. The 
so-called exedra of Herodes Atticus (which answers in all respects 
to a nymphaeum in the Roman style), the nymphaeum in the 
palace of Domitian and those in the villa of Hadrian at Tibur 
(five in number) may tie specially mentioned. The term 
nymphaeum was also applied to the fountains of water in the 
atrium of the Christian basilica, which according to Eusebius 
(x. 4) were symbols of purification. 


NYMPHENBURG, formerly a village, but since 1899 an in- 
corporated suburb of Munich, in the kingdom of Bavaria. It 
has a palace, built about the middle of the 17th century, on the 
model of that at Versailles, and long a favourite residence of 
the Bavarian elector, Maximilian Joseph. The famous china 
manufactory of Nymphenburg, founded in 1754 at Neudeck 
by a potter named Niedermeyer, was shortly afterwards removed 
hither and, after being long under royal patronage, is now a 
private undertaking. The elector Charles Albert of Bavaria 
was reputed to have made a treaty with Louis XV. of France 
in May 1 741 at the beginning of the War of the Austrian Succession 
for the division of Austria, and this was called the treaty of 
Nymphenburg. It has, however, been conclusively proved a 
forgery. But a treaty was concluded here on the 28th of May 
1 741, between Bavaria and Spain, and another between Bavaria 
and the Rhenish Palatinate in 1766. 


NYMPHS, in Greek mythology, the generic name of a large 
number of female divinities of inferior rank, personifications of 
the creative and fostering activities of nature. The word is 
possibly connected with the root of vktpos, nubes (" cloud "), 
and originally meant " veiled," referring to the custom of a bride 
being led veiled from her home to that of the husband: hence, 
a married woman, and, in general, one of marriageable age. 
Others refer the word (and also Lat. nubere and the Ger. Knospe) 
to a root expressing the idea of " swelling " (according to 
Hesychius, one of the meanings of vvfKprj is " rose-bud "). The 
home of the nymphs is on mountains and in groves, by springs 
and rivers, in valleys and cool grottoes. They are frequently 
associated with the superior divinities, the huntress Artemis, the 
prophetic Apollo, the reveller and god of trees Dionysus, and 
with rustic gods such as Pan and Hermes (as the god of 
shepherds). 

The nymphs were distinguished according to the different 
spheres of nature with which they were connected. Sea nymphs 
were Oceanids or Neretds, daughters of Oceanus or Nereus. 
Naiades (from Gr. vdeiv, flow, cf. vafia, " stream ") presided 
over springs, rivers and lakes. Oreades (6po$, mountain) 
were nymphs of mountains and grottoes, one of the most 
famous of whom was Echo. Napaeae (vaTrrj, dell) and Alsetdes 
(aXcos, grove) were nymphs of glens and groves. Dry odes 
(q.v.) or Hamadryades were nymphs of forests and trees. 

The Greek nymphs, after the introduction of their cult into 
Latium, gradually absorbed into their ranks the indigenous 
Italian divinities of springs and streams (Juturna, Egeria, 
Carmentis, Fons), while the Lymphae (originally Lumpae), 
Italian water-goddesses, owing to the accidental similarity of 
name, were identified with the Greek Nymphac. Among the 
Romans their sphere of influence was restricted, and they appear 
almost exclusively as divinities of the watery element.

O, The sixteenth letter of the Phoenician and early 
Greek alphabets, the fifteenth in English and the 
fourteenth in Latin. Between N and O the Phoenician 
and the Ionic Greek alphabet have a sibilant — 
in Greek a—x. The Western Greek alphabet had a different 
symbol, X, for the sound of x and placed it at the end, 
as did its descendant the Latin alphabet. The original form 
of was a more or less roughly formed circle. The Aramaic *- 
and Hebrew v t which seem so different, arise from a circle left 
open at the top, (J, a form which can be traced in Aramaic 
from the 5th or 6th century B.C. In the Greek alphabets the 
circle appears sometimes with a dot in the centre, but in many 
cases it is doubtful whether this mark is, intentional, or is only 
the result of fixing a sharp point there while describing the 
circle. Sometimes O is lozenge-shaped Q and rarely (in Arcadia 
and Elis) rectangular □. In many varieties of the Greek 
alphabet this symbol was used, as it always was in Latin, for 
the long as well as the short o-sound and also for the long vowel 
(in the Ionic alphabet written ov) which arose from contraction 
of two vowels or the loss of a consonant (5^XoDr€=57?X6eT€, 
oIkovs^qIkovs). As early as the 8th century • Ionic Greek 
had invented a separate symbol for the long o-sound, viz. Q. 
This when borrowed by other dialects showed at first some 
variety of usage, though practically none in form. As this was 
placed at the end of the ordinary (not the numeral) Greek 
alphabet, " alpha and omega " has become a proverbial phrase 
for first and last. The Greeks themselves, however, did not 
call Q omega (great 0) nor did they call O omicron (little 0), 
though these names are given even in modern Greek grammars. 
The former was called simply and the latter u (ou, pronounced 
as 00 in moon). The Hebrew and probably the Phoenician name 
for O was Ain (Ayin), and in the Semitic alphabet, which does 
not indicate vowels, the symbol stood for a " voiced glottal 
stop " and also for a " voiced velar spirant " (Zimmern). The 
most important feature of this vowel is the rounding of the lips 
in its production, which, according to its degree, modifies the 
nature of the vowel considerably, as can be observed in the 
pronunciation of the increasingly rounded series saw t no t who. 
In Attic Greek O and Q were not really a pair, for o + o became 
not co but ov, o being a close and 0) an open sound. In Latin the 
converse was more nearly true. Though short changed in 
the Latin of the last age of the Roman republic to u in un- 
accented syllables always (except after u whether vowel or con- 
sonant), and sometimes also in accented syllables, this was 
not equally true of vulgar Latin, as is shown by the Romance 
languages. In English also the short and the long are of 
different qualities, the short in words like not y got being in 
Sweet's phonetic terminology a low-back-wide-round, the long 
in words like no a mid-back-wide-round. The long vowel 
becomes more rounded as it is being pronounced, so that it 
ends in a «-sound, though this is not so noticeable in weak 
syllables like the final syllable of follow. The so-called modified 
6 is a rounded e-sound found in several varieties. The sound 
heard in words like the German Goiter is, according to Sweet, a 
low-front-wide-round, while Jespersen regards it as not low 
but middle. A mid-front-narrow-round vowel is found short 
in French words like pen, long in je&ne and in endings like 
that of honteuse. The Norse sound written <j> is of the same 
nature. (P. Gi.) 

OAK (O. Eng., ac) t a word found, variously modified, in all 
Germanic languages, and applied to plants of the genus Quercus, 
natural order Fagaceae (Cupuliferae of de Candolle), including 
some of the most important timber trees of the north temperate 
zone. All the species are arborescent or shrubby, varying in 
size from the most stately of forest trees to the dwarfish bush. 
Monoecious, and bearing their male flowers in catkins, they are 
readily distinguished from the rest of the catkin-bearing trees 
by their peculiar fruit, an acorn or nut, enclosed at the base in a 
woody cup, formed by the consolidation of numerous involucral 
bracts developed beneath the fertile flower, simultaneously with 
a cup-like expansion of the thalamus, to which the bracteal 
scales are more or less adherent. The ovary, three-celled at 
first, but becoming one-celled and one-seeded by abortion, is 
surmounted by an inconspicuous perianth with six small teeth. 
The male flowers are in small clusters on the usually slender and 
pendent stalk, forming an interrupted catkin; the stamens 
vary in number, usually six to twelve. The alternate leaves are 
more or less deeply sinuated or cut in many species, but in 
some of the deciduous and many of the evergreen kinds 
are nearly or quite entire on the margin. 

The oaks are widely distributed over the temperate parts of 
Europe, Asia, North Africa and North America. In the western 
hemisphere they range along the Mexican highlands and the 
Andes far into the tropics, while in the Old World the genus, 
well represented in the Himalayas and the hills of China, exists 
likewise in the peninsula of Malacca, in the Indian Archipelago 
and Malaya to the Philippine Islands and Borneo. On the

mountains of Europe and North America they grow only at 
moderate elevations, and none approach the arctic circle. The 
multitude of species and the many intermediate forms render 
their exact limitation difficult, but those presenting sufficiently 
marked characters to justify specific rank probably approach 
300 in number. 

The well-known Q. Robur, one of the most valued of the 
genus, and the most celebrated in history and myth, may be 
taken as a type of the oaks with sinuated leaves. Though known 
in England, where it is the only indigenous species, as the 
British oak, it is a native of most of the milder parts of Europe, 
extending from the shores of the Atlantic to the Ural; its 
most northern limit is attained in Norway, where it is found 
wild up to lat. 63 , and near the Lindesnaes forms woods of some 
extent, the trees occasionally acquiring a considerable size. In 
western Russia it flourishes in lat. 6o°, but on the slope of the 
Ural the 56th parallel is about its utmost range. Its northern 
limit nearly coincides with that of successful wheat cultivation. 
Southwards it extends to Sardinia, Sicily and the Morea. In 
Asia it is found on the Caucasus, but does not pass the Ural ridge 
into Siberia. In Britain and in most of its Continental habitats 
two varieties exist, regarded by many as distinct species: one, 
Q. pedunculata, has the acorns, generally two or more together, 
on long stalks, and the leaves nearly sessile; while in the other, 
Q. sessiliflora y the fruit is without or with a very short peduncle, 
and the leaves are furnished with well-developed petioles. But, 
though the extreme forms of these varieties are very dissimilar, 
innumerable modifications are found between them; hence it 
is more convenient to regard them as at most sub-species of Q. 
Robur. The British oak is one of the largest trees of the genus, 
though old specimens are often more remarkable for the great 
size of the trunk and main boughs than for very lofty growth. 
The spreading branches have a tendency to assume a tortuous 
form, owing to the central shoots becoming abortive, and the 
growth thus being continued laterally, causing a zigzag develop- 
ment, more exaggerated in old trees and those standing in 

	From Kotschy, op. cit. Plate XXVII. 

	Fig. 2. — Q. pedunculate; half natural size. 

exposed situations; to this peculiarity the picturesque aspect of 
ancient oaks is largely due. When standing in dense woods the 
trees are rather straight and formal in early growth, especially 
the sessile-fruited kinds, and the gnarled character traditionally 
assigned to the oak applies chiefly to its advanced age. The 
broad deeply-sinuated leaves with blunt rounded lobes are of a 
peculiar yellowish 'colour when the buds unfold in May, but 
assume a more decided green towards midsummer, and eventually 
become rather dark in tint; they do not change to their brown 
autumnal hue until late in October, and on brushwood and 
saplings the withered foliage is often retained until the spring. 
The catkins appear soon after the young leaves, usually in 
England towards the end of May; the acorns, oblong in form, 
are in shallow cups with short, scarcely projecting scales; 
the fruit is shed the first autumn, often before the foliage 
changes. 

Vast oak forests still covered the greater part of England 
and central Europe in the earlier historic period; and, though 
they have been gradually cleared in the progress of cultivation, 
oak is yet the prevailing tree in most of the woods of France, 
Germany and southern Russia, while in England the coppices 
and the few fragments of natural forest yet left are mainly 
composed of this species. The pedunculated variety is most 
abundant in the southern and midland counties; the sessile- 
fruited kinds in the northern parts and in Wales, especially 
in upland districts; the straighter growth and abundant acorns 
of this sub-species have led to its extensive introduction into 
plantations. The name of " durmast " oak, originally given 
to a dark-fruited variety of Q. sessiliflora in the New Forest, 
has been adopted by foresters as a general term for this kind of 
oak; it seems to be the most prevalent form in Germany and 
in the south of Europe. Many of the ancient oaks that remain 
in England may date from Saxon times, and some perhaps 
from an earlier period; the growth of trees after the trunk has 
become hollow is extremely slow, and the age of such venerable 
giants only matter of vague surmise. The celebrated Newland 
oak in Gloucestershire, known for centuries as " the great 
oak," was by the latest measurement 47^ ft. in girth at 5 ft. 
from the ground. The Cowthorpe oak, standing (a ruin) near 
Wetherby in Yorkshire, at the same height measures 38^ ft., 
and seems to have been of no smaller dimensions when described 
by Evelyn two centuries ago; like most of the giant oaks of 
Britain, it is of the pedunculate variety. 

The wood of the British oak, when grown in perfection, is 
the most valuable produced in temperate climates. The heart- 
wood varies in colour from dark brown to pale yellowish- 
brown; hard, close-grained, and little liable to split accidentally, 
it is, for a hard wood, easy to work. Under water it excels 
most woods in durability, and none stand better alternate 
exposure to drought and moisture, while under cover it is nearly 
indestructible as long as dry-rot is prevented by free admission 
of air. Its weight varies from 48 to about 55 lb the cubic foot, 
but in very hard slowly-grown trunks sometimes approaches 
60 lb. The sap-wood is lighter and much more perishable, but 
is of value for many purposes of rural economy. The relative 
qualities of the two varieties have been the frequent subject 
of debate, the balance of practical testimony seeming to establish 
the superiority of Q, pedunculate, as far as durability in water 
is concerned; but when grown under favourable circumstances 
the sessile oak is certainly equally lasting if kept dry. The 
wood of the durmast oak is commonly heavier and of a darker 
colour, hence the other is sometimes called by woodmen the 
white oak, and in France is known as the " chene blanc." The 
oak of Britain is still in demand for the construction of merchant 
shipping, though teak has become in some measure its substitute, 
and foreign oak of various quality and origin largely takes 
its place. Its great abundance of curved trunks and boughs 
rendered the oak peculiarly valuable to the shipwright when 
the process of bending timber artificially was less understood; 
the curved pieces are still useful for knees. The younger oaks 
are employed by the carpenter, wheelwright, wagon-builder 
and for innumerable purposes by the country artisan. The 
most durable of fences are those formed of small oaks, split 
lengthwise by the wedge into thin boards. The finely-grained 
heart-wood is sought by the cabinetmaker for the manufacture 

	From Kotschy, op. cti. Plate XXXII. 

	Fig. 3. — Q. sessiliflora; half natural size. 

of furniture, and high prices are often given for the gnarled 
and knotted portions of slowly-grown trees, to be sawn into 
veneers. Oak was formerly largely used by wood-carvers, and 
is still in some demand for those artists, being harder and 
more durable than lime and other woods that yield more readily 
to the sculptor's tool. Oak was thus applied at a very early 
date; the shrine of Edward the Confessor, still existing in the 
abbey at Westminster, sound after the lapse of 800 years, is of 
dark-coloured oak-wood. The wood, of unknown age, found 
submerged in peat-bogs, and of a black hue, is largely used 
in decorative art under the name of " bog-oak." 

The oak grows most luxuriantly on deep strong clays, cal- 
careous marl or stiff loam, but will flourish in nearly any deep 
well-drained soil, excepting peat or loose sand; in marshy or 
moist places the tree may grow well for a time, but the timber 
is rarely sound; on hard rocky ground and exposed hillsides 
the growth is extremely slow and the trees small, but the wood 
is generally very hard and durable. The oak will not bear 
exposure to the full force of the sea gale, though in ravines 
and on sheltered slopes oak woods sometimes extend nearly 
to the shore. The cultivation of this tree in Europe forms one 
of the most important branches of the forester's art. It is 
frequently raised at once by sowing the acorns on the ground 
where the trees are required, the fruit being gathered in the 
autumn as soon as shed, and perfectly ripe seeds selected; 
but the risk of destruction by mice and other vermin is so great 
that transplanting from a nursery-bed is in most cases to be 
preferred. 

The acorns should be sown in November on well-prepared ground, 
and covered to a depth of 1 J or 2 in.; the seeds germinate in the 
spring, and the seedlings are usually transplanted when one or two 
years old to nursery-beds, where they are allowed to grow from 
two to four years, till required for the plantation. Some authorities 
recommend the tap-roots to be cut in the second year, with the view 
of increasing the ball of fibre; but, if the trees are removed from 
the seed-bed sufficiently early, the root is best left to its natural 
development. The oak requires shelter in the early stages of growth ; 
in England the Scotch pine is thought best for this purpose, though 
Norway spruce answers as well on suitable ground, and larch and other 
trees are sometimes substituted. The conifers are allowed to grow 
to a height of from 3 to 5 ft. before the young oaks are planted, 
and are gradually thinned out as the latter increase in size. The 
distance between the oaks depends upon the growth intended before 
thinning the young wood; usually they are placed from 8 to 12 ft. 
apart, and the superabundant trees cut out as they begin to interfere 
with each other. The lower branches often require removal, to 
ensure the formation of a tall straight trunk, and this operation 
should be performed before the superfluous shoots get too large, 
or the timber will be injured; but, as with all trees, unnecessary 
pruning should be avoided, as every branch removed lessens the 
vigour of growth. Where artificial copsewood is the object, hazel, 
hornbeam and other bushes may be planted between the oaks; but, 
when large timber is required, the trees are best without undergrowth. 

The growth of the oak is slow, though it varies greatly in 
different trees; Loudon states that an oak, raised from the 
acorn in a garden at Sheffield Place, Sussex, became in seventy 
years 12 ft. in circumference; but the increase of the trunk 
is usually very much slower, and when grown for large timber 
oak can rarely be profitably felled till the first century of its 
growth is completed. The tree will continue to form wood 
for 150 or 200 years before showing any symptoms of decay. 
As firewood oak holds a high position, though in Germany it 
is considered inferior to beech for that purpose. It makes 
excellent charcoal, especially for metallurgic processes; the 
Sussex iron, formerly regarded as the best produced in Britain, 
was smelted with oak charcoal from the great woods of the 
adjacent Weald, until they became so thinned that the precious 
fuel was no longer obtainable. 

An important product of oak woods is the bark that from a remote 
period has been the chief tanning material of Europe. The most 
valuable kind is that obtained from young trees of twenty to thirty 
years* growth, but the trunks and boughs of timber trees also furnish 
a large supply; it is separated from the tree most easily when the 
sap is rising in the spring. It is then carefully dried by the free 
action of the air, and when dry built into long narrow stacks until 
needed for use. ^ The value of oak bark depends upon the amount 
of tannin contained in it, which varies much, depending not only 
on the growth of the tree but on the care bestowed on the preparation 
of the bark itself, as it soon ferments and spoils by exposure to wet, 
while too much sun-heat is injurious. That obtained from the sessile- 
fruited oak is richer in tannic acid than that yielded by Q. pedun- 
culata, and the bark of trees growing in the open is more valuable 
than the produce of the dense forest or coppice. The bark of young 
oak branches has been employed in medicine from the days of 
Dioscorides, but is not used in modern practice. The astringent 
principle is a peculiar kind of tannic acid, called by chemists querci- 
tannic, which, t yielding more stable compounds with gelatine than 
other forms, gives oak bark its high value to the tanner. According 
to Neubauer, the bark of young oaks contains from 7 to 10% of 
this principle; in old trees the proportion is much less. 

The acorns of the oak possess a considerable economic importance 
as food for swine. In the Saxon period the " mast " seems to have 
been regarded as the most valuable produce of an oak wood ; nor 
was its use always confined to the support of the herds, for in time 
of dearth acorns were boiled and eaten by the poor as a substitute 
for bread both in England and France, as the sweeter produce 
of Q. Esculus is still employed in southern Europe. Large nerds of 
swine in all the great oak woods of Germany depend for their autumn 
maintenance on acorns; and in the remaining royal forests of 
England the inhabitants of the neighbouring villages yet claim their 
ancient right of " pannage," turning their hogs into the woods in 
October and November. Some trees of the sessile-fruited oak bear 
sweet acorns in Britain, and several varieties were valued by the 
ancient Italians for their edible fruit. A peculiar kind of sugar called 
guercite exists in all acorns. A bitter principle to which the name of 
quercin has been applied by Gerber, its discoverer, has also been 
detected in the acorn of the common oak; the nutritive portion 
seems chiefly a form of starch. A spirit has been distilled from 
acorns in process of germination, when the saccharine principle is 
most abundant. 

The British oak grows well in the northern and middle states 
of America; and, from the superiority of the wood to that of 
Q. alba and its more abundant production of acorns, it will 
probably be much planted as the natural forests are destroyed. 
The young trees require protection from storms and late frosts 
even more than in England; the red pine 'of the north-eastern 
states, Ptnus resinosa, answers well as a nurse, but the pitch 
pine and other species may be employed. In the southern 
parts of Australia and in New Zealand the tree seems to flourish 
as well as in its native home. 

The oak in Europe is liable to injury from a great variety 
of insect enemies: the young wood is attacked by the larvae of 
the small stag-beetle and several other Coleoptera, and those of 
the wood-leopard moth, goat moth and other Lepidoptera feed 
upon it occasionally; the foliage is devoured by innumerable 
larvae; indeed, it has been stated that half the plant-eating 
insects of England prey more or less upon the oak, and in some 
seasons it is difficult to find a leaf perfectly free from their 
depredations. The young shoots are chosen by many species of 
Cynipidae and their allies as a receptacle for their eggs, giving 
rise to a variety of gall-like excrescences, from which few oak 
trees are quite free. 

Of the European timber trees of the genus, the next in importance 
to the British oak is Q. Cerris, the Turkey oak of the nurserymen. 
This is a- fine species, having when young straighter branches than 
Q. Robur, but in old age the boughs generally curve downwards, 
and the tree acquires a wide spreading head; the bark is dark 
brown, becoming grey and furrowed in large trees; the foliage 
varies much, but in the prevailing kinds the leaves are very deeply 
sin ua ted, with pointed, often irregular lobes, the footstalks short, 
and furnished at the base with long linear stipules that do not fall 
with the leaf, but remain attached to the bud till the following 
spring, giving a marked feature to the young shoots. The large 
sessile acorns are longer than those of Q. Robur, and are dark-brown 
when ripe; the hemispherical cups are covered with long, narrow, 
almost bristly scales, giving them a mossy aspect; the fruit ripens 
the first autumn. The foliage in some of the numerous varieties is 
almost evergreen, and in Britain is retained long after the autumnal 
withering. 

This oak abounds all over the Turkish peninsula, and forms a large 
portion of the vast forests that clothe the slopes of the Taurus ranges 
and the south shores of the Black Sea; it is likewise common in 
Italy and Sardinia, and occurs in the south of France and also in 
Hungary. It was introduced into England by Philip Miller about 
1735. a °d is now common in parks and plantations, where it seems 
to nourish in nearly all soils. The Turkey oak in southern England 
grows twice as fast as Q. Robur; in the mild climate of Devonshire 
and Cornwall it has reached a height of 100 ft. and a diameter of 
4 ft. in eighty years, which is about the limit of its profitable growth 
for timber. The wood is hard, heavy and of fine grain, quite equal 
to the best British oak for indoor use, but of very variable durability 
where exposed to weather. The ships of Greece and Turkey are 
largely built of it, but it has not always proved satisfactory in 
English dockyards. The heart-wood is dark in colour, takes a fine 
polish, and from the prominence of the medullary rays is valuable 
to the furniture maker; it weighs from 40 to 50 lb the cubic foot. 
The comparatively rapid growth of the tree is its great recommenda- 
tion to the planter; it is best raised from acorns sown on the spot, 
as they are very bitter and little liable to the attacks of vermin; 
the tree sends down a long tap-root, which should be curtailed by 
cutting or early transplanting, if the young trees are to be removed. 
It seems peculiarly adapted for the mild moist climate of Ireland. 

In North America, where the species of oak are very numerous, 
the most important member of the group is Q. alba, the white 
oak, abounding all over the eastern districts to the continent 
from Lake Winnipeg and the St Lawrence countries of the 
shores of the Mexican Gulf. In aspect it more nearly resembles 
Q. Robur than any other species, forming a thick trunk with 
spreading base and, when growing in glades or other open places, 
huge spreading boughs, less twisted and gnarled than those or 
the English oak, and covered with a whitish bark that gives 
a marked character to the tree. The leaves are large, often 
irregular in form, usually with a few deep lobes dilated at the 
end; they are of a bright light green on the upper surface, but 
whitish beneath; they turn to a violet tint in autumn. The 

egg-shaped acorns are placed singly or two together on 
short stalks; they are in most years 
sparingly produced, but are 
occasionally borne in some abund- 
ance. On rich loams and the 
alluvial soils of river-valleys, 
when well drained, the tree attains a 
large size, often rivalling the giant 
► oaks of Europe; trunks of 3 or 4 ft. 
in diameter are frequently found, 
and sometimes these dimensions 
are greatly exceeded. The wood 
is variable in quality and, though hard in texture, is less durable 
than the best oak of British growth; the heart-wood is of a 
light reddish brown varying to an olive tint; a Canadian 
specimen weighs 52 J ft) the cubic foot. 

Q. obtusiloba, the post oak of the backwoodsman, a smaller tree 
with rough leaves and notched upper lobes, produces an abundance 
of acorns and good timber, said to be more durable than that of 
the white oak. 

The pin oak, sometimes called the " burr-oak,'* Q. macrocarpa, 
is remarkable for its large acorns, the cups bordered on the edge 
by a fringe of long narrow scales; the leaves are very large, some- 
times from 10 in. to 1 ft. in length, with very deep lobes at the lower 
part, but dilated widely at the apex, and there notched. The tree is 
described by Prof. C. S. Sargent (Silva of North America) as one of the

most valuable timber trees of North America, its wood being superior 
in strength even to that of Q. alba, with which it is commercially 
confounded. 

The over-cup oak, Q. lyrata, is a large tree, chiefly found on 
swampy land in the southern states ; the lyrate leaves are dilated at 
the end ; the globose acorns are nearly covered by the tuberculated 
cups. 

In the woods of Oregon, from the Columbia river southwards, 
an oak is found bearing some resemblance to the British oak in 
ioliage and in its thick trunk and widely-spreading boughs, but 
the bark is white as in Q. alba\ it is Q. Garryana, the western oak 
of T. Nuttall. This tree acquires large dimensions, the trunk being 
often from 4 to 6 ft. in diameter ; the wood is strong, hard and close- 
grained ; the acorns are produced in great quantity, and are used by 
the Indians as food. 

The red oak, Q. rubra, has thin large leaves on long petioles, the 
lobes very long and acute, the points almost bristly; they are pink 
when they first expand in spring, but become of a bright glossy 
green when full-grown; in autumn they change to the deep purple- 
red which gives the tree its name. Com- 
mon throughout the northern and middle 
states and Canada, the red oak attains a 
large size only on good soils; the wood 
is of little value, being coarse and porous, 
but it is largely used for cask-staves; the 
bark is a valuable tanning material. 

A species nearly allied is the scarlet 
oak, Q. coccinea, often confounded with 
the red oak, but with larger leaves, with 
long lobes ending in several acute points; 
they change to a brilliant scarlet with the 
first October frosts, giving one of the most 
striking of the various glowing tints that 
render the American forests so beautiful 
in autumn. The trunk, though often of 
considerable size, yields but an indifferent 
wood, employed for similar purposes to 
that of Q. rubra; the bark is one of the 
best tanning materials of the country. 
Both these oaks grow well in British 
plantations, where their bright autumn 
foliage, though seldom so decided in tint 
as in their native woods, gives them a 
certain picturesque value. 

Nearly akin to these are several other 
forms of little but botanical interest ; not 
far removed is the black or dyer's oak, From K 0tschy ^. A PIateXL . 
Q. ttnctorta, a large and handsome J ' 

species, with a trunk sometimes 4 ft. in Fig. 6.— Q. castaneaefolia, 
diameter, not uncommon in most forests one-third natural size, 
east of the Mississippi, especially in 
somewhat upland districts. The leaves are frequently irregular in 
outline, the lobes rather short and blunt, widening towards the 
end, but with setaceous points; the acorns are nearly globular. 
The wood is coarsely grained, as in all the red-oak group, but 
harder and more durable than that of Q. rubra t and is often 
employed for building and for flour-barrels and cask-staves. The 
bark, very dark externally, is an excellent tanning substance; the 
inner layers form the quercitron of commerce, used by dyers for 
communicating to fabrics various tints of yellow, and, with iron 
salts, yielding a series of brown and drab hues; the colouring 
property depends on a crystalline principle called guercitrin, of 
which it should contain about 8%. The cut-leaved oaks are repre- 
sented in eastern Asia by several species, of which Q. mongolica is

	Fig. 7. — Q. Ilex; half natural size. 

widely spread over Dahuria, north China and the adjacent countries; 
one of the Chinese silkworms is said to feed on the leaves. 

The chestnut oaks of America represent a section distinguished 
by the merely serrated leaves, with parallel veins running to the end 
of the serratures.-Hp. Prinus, a beautiful tree of large growth, and its 
subspecies castanea and montana, yield good timber. Q. Chinquapin 
or prinoides, a dwarf species, often only 1 ft. in height, forms dense 
miniature thickets on the barren uplands of Kansas and Missouri, 
and affords abundant sweet acorns; the tree is called by the hunters 
of the plains the " shin-oak." Q. castaneaefolia, represented in fig. 6, 
is a native of the woods of the Transcaucasian region of western 
Asia. 

Evergreen oaks with entire leaves are represented in North America 
by*4*. vtrginiana, also known as Q. virens, the live oak of the southern 
states; more or less abundant on the Atlantic coasts of theCarolinas 
and Florida, its true home is the country around the Mexican Gulf, 
where it rarely grows more than 50 or 60 m. inland. The oval leaves 
are dark-green above, and whitish with stellate hairs beneath, the 
margin entire and slightly recurved. The live oak is one of the most 
valuable timber trees of the genus, the wood being extremely 
durable, both exposed to air and under^ water; heavy and close- 
grained, it is perhaps the best of the American oaks for shipbuilding, 
and is invaluable for water-wheels and mill-work. The tree in 
England is scarcely hardy, though it will grow freely in some 
sheltered places. 

The evergreen oak of southern Europe is Q. Ilex, usually a smaller 
tree, frequently of rather shrub-like appearance, with abundant 
glossy dark-green leaves, generally ovate in shape and more or less 
prickly at the^ margin, but sometimes with the edges entire; the 
under surface is hoary; the acorns are oblong on short stalks. The 
ilex, also known as the " holm oak " from its resemblance to the^ holly, 
abounds in all the Mediterranean countries, showing a partiality for 
the sea air. The stem sometimes grows 80 or 90 ft. in height, and 
old specimens are occasionally of large diameter; but it does not 
often reach a great size. In its native lands it attains a vast age; 
Pliny attributes to several trees then growing in Rome a greater 
antiquity than the city itself. The wood is very heavy and hard, 
weighing 70 lb the cubic foot; the colour is dark brown; it is used 
in Spain and Italy for furniture, and in the former country for fire- 
wood and charcoal. In Britain the evergreen oak is quite hardy in 
ordinary winters, and is useful to the ornamental planter from its 
capacity for resisting the sea gales; but it generally remains of small 
size. Q. Ballota, a closely allied species abundant in Morocco, 
bears large edible acorns, which form an article of trade with Spain; 
an oil, resembling that of the olive, is obtained from them by ex- 
pression. Q. Ilex, var. Gramuntia, also furnishes a fruit which, 
after acquiring sweetness by keeping, is eaten by the Spaniards. 

In America several oaks exist with narrow lanceolate leaves, 
from which characteristic they are known as " willow oaks." Q. 

Phellos, a rather large tree found on swampy 
land in the southern states, is the most im- 
portant of this group; its timber is of indifferent 
quality. 

The cork oak, Q. Suber, the bark of which 
yields cork (q.v.) It is a native of the west 
Mediterranean area. In Spain the wood is of 
some value, being hard and close-grained, and 
the inner bark is used for tanning. From its 
rugged silvery bark and dark-green foliage, it is 
a handsome tree, quite hardy in Cornwall and 
Devonshire, where it has grown to a large size. 
The valonia of commerce, one of the richest of tanning materials, 
is the acorn of Q. Aegilops, a fine species indigenous to Greece and 
the coasts of the Levant, and sometimes called the " Oak of Bashan." 
The very large acorns are remarkable for their thick cups with long 
reflexed scales; the leaves are large, oblong, with deep serratures 
terminating in a bristle-like point. _ The cups are the most valuable 
portion of the valonia, abounding in tannic acid; immature acorns 
are sometimes exported under the name of " camatina." The allied 
Q. Vallonea of Asia Minor likewise yields valonia. 

Some oaks are of indirect importance from products formed by 
their insect enemies. Of these the Aleppo gall (see Galls) is yielded 
by Q. infectoria, a native of Asia Minor and western Asia. Q. 
cocctfera, a small bush growing in Spain and many countries around 
the Mediterranean, furnishes the kermes dye (Kermes). Q. persica, 
or according to some Q. mannifera, attacked by a kind of Coccus % 
yields a sweet exudation which the Kurds collect and use as manna, 
or as a substitute for honey or sugar in various confections (see 
Manna). 

OAKHAM, a market town, and the county town of Rutland, 
England, 94 m. N. by W. of London by the Midland railway. 
Pop. (1901) 3294. The church of All Saints ranges in style 
from Early English to Perpendicular, belonging in appearance 
mainly to the latter style. Of Oakham Castle 5 founded in the 
reign of Henry II., the principal remnant is the notable Norman 
hall, used as the county hall. The manor came in the time of

Henry II. into the hands of Walcheline de Ferrers, and subse- 
quently passed, through many owners, to the duchy of Bucking- 
ham, whence it descended to the earls of Winchelsca. A peculiar 
custom attaching to the manor is to claim a horseshoe from every 
peer who, for the first time, passes through the town. Flore's 
House in the main street is an interesting building dating from 
the 13th century. Oakham school was endowed as a grammar 
school by Robert Johnson, archdeacon of Leicester, in 1584; 
it now has classical and modern sides. Not far from the town 
are the kennels of the Cottesmore hunt. 


OAKLAND, a city and the county-seat of Alameda county, 
California, U.S.A., situated opposite and about 6 m. distant 
from San Francisco, on the eastern shore of San Francisco Bay. 
Pop. (1890) 48,682; (1900) 66,960, of whom 17,256 were foreign- 
born, 3197 being Irish, 2742 German, 2026 English, 1544 English- 
Canadians, 1020 Portuguese and 994 Swedish; (1910 census) 
150,174. It is the terminus of the Ogden branch of the Southern 
(formerly Central) Pacific, of the Coast Line of the Atchison, 
Topeka & Santa Fe, and of the Western Pacific railways. 
Passengers and freight from the East to San Francisco are 
transferred by ferry from Oakland. A branch of the bay (called 
Oakland Harbour) divides Oakland from Alameda, and the rail- 
way piers of Oakland run directly out into the bay for more than 
2 m. toward San Francisco, thus shortening the ferry connexions. 
Lake Merritt, in the heart of the city, a favourite pleasure resort, 
is the centre of the city's park system. Oakland is the seat of 
California College (co-educational, Baptist, opened in 1870), 
and of St Mary's College (Roman Catholic, 1863) for men; 
and in the suburban village of Mills College, west of the city, 
is Mills College (non-sectarian, 187 1) for women, an institu- 
tion of high rank. Electric power for the city is derived 
from Colgate, on the Yuba river, 219 m. distant. Oakland 
has important manufacturing interests, the total value of 
its factory products in 1905 being $9,072,539, 69% more than 
in 1900. 

The site of the present city (as well as that of Alameda and 
Berkeley) lay originally within the limits of a great private 
Mexican grant which was confirmed by the United States 
authorities. A settlement was begun — at first by " squatters " 
in defiance of the private claim — in 1850; in May 1852 this 
was incorporated as a town (the name being derived from a 
wood of oaks in the midst of which the first settlement was made), 
and in March 1854 it was chartered as a city. In 1869 it was 
selected as the western terminus of the Central Pacific, a choice 
which greatly promoted Oakland's commercial importance. 
The water front was recklessly given away in 1852, and the 
resulting disputes and litigation lasted for more than thirty 
years; in 1908 the water front reverted to the city. The 
population increased more than sixfold from i860 to 1870, and 
doubled in 1000-1910. It became the county-seat in 1874. In 
December 1910 a commission form of government was adopted. 


OAKUM (O. Eng. dcumbe or — acumbe, tow, literally "off-comb- 
ings "), a preparation of tarred fibre used in shipbuilding, for 
caulking or packing joints of timbers in wood vessels and the 
deck planking of iron and steel ships. Oakum is made by pre- 
ference from old tarry ropes and cordage of vessels, and its 
picking and preparation has been a common penal occupation 
in prisons and workhouses. White oakum is made from untarred 
materials. 


OAMARU, a municipal borough on the east coast of South 
Island, New Zealand, in the county of Waitaki and provincial 
district of Otago; on the main railway between Christchurch 
(152 m. N.E.) and Dunedin (78 m. S.S.W.). Pop. (1906) 5071. 
It is the outlet of the largest agricultural district in New Zealand. 
A breakwater and mole, constructed of blocks of concrete, 
enclose a commodious basin, forming one of the safest harbours 
in the colony. The export of frozen meat is important. The 
town is built of white Oamaru limestone. Brown coal is ob- 
tained at the entrance of Shag valley, 40 m. S. The district is 
famed for its stock, and the fine quality of its grain; also for 
the character of the English grasses laid down there, which 
flourish in a rich black loam on a limestone formation. 

CANNES, in Babylonian mythology, the name given by 
Berossus to a mythical being who taught mankind wisdom. 
He is identical with the god Ea (q.v.) t although there may not 
be any direct connexion between the two names. Berossus 
describes Oannes as having the body of a fish but underneath 
the figure of a man. He is described as dwelling in the Persian 
Gulf, and rising out of the waters in the daytime and furnishing 
mankind instruction in writing, the arts and the various sciences. 
The culture-myth on which the account of Berossus rests has 
not yet been found in Babylonian literature, but there are 
numerous indications in hymns and incantations that confirm 
the indentification with Ea, and also prove the substantial 
correctness of the conceptions regarding Oannes-Ea as given by 
Berossus. (M. Ja.) 


OAR (A.S. dr; M. Eng. ore; Lat. remus; Gr. kperjj&s : Sans. 
aritra; Fr. rame; Ital. Span., Port. rama) % the instrument used for 
propelling a boat in rowing (q.v.). The word " oar " is probably 
derived from an old root ar t meaning to drive, to force away 
(cf. ar-ar-e, aratrum, plough). Such an appellation would easily 
be suggested by the visible difference in the action of the power 
employed by means of the oar against a thowl, or rowlock, 
from that of the more primitive paddle, where the power is 
gained by the action of one hand against the other. In the 
development of rowing from paddling the task of shaping the 
instrument of propulsion must have followed gradually the 
necessities indicated by use. In rowing, as well as in paddling, 
the leverage is of the second order, in which the weight lies 
between the power and the fulcrum. The point at which the 
power pressed the arm of the lever against the weight in rowing 
would soon attract attention by the frequent breakage of the 
paddle so employed. Experience would demand a thicker loom, 
and would soon teach the desirability of increasing the leverage 
where possible, and upon this would arise naturally the practical 
questions of the length of the oar, of the breadth of the blade, 
and of the right proportion of the parts of the oar, inboard and 
outboard, to each other. Then would also occur the problem 
of how to keep this proportion, which 
in practice would be liable to dis- 
arrangement by the slipping outward 
of the oar during the recovery from 
each stroke. Hence would arise the 
use of the thong (rp<wr6s, rpoTrwrfjp), 
familiar to ancient Greek and modern 
Levantine, and, in northern and 
western waters, the invention of the 
" button," with which in various 
shapes the rowing world is now pro- 
vided. Other devices, such as a hole 
bored in a piece of wood attached to 
the oar, or even a metal ring, will, in 
different localities, be found answering 
the same purpose. 

In the early stages of the transition 
from paddling to rowing, the oar 
would naturally be used at an acute 
angle vertically to the boat's side. 
In paddling the upper hand is used 
to push from you, the lower hand to 
pull towards you. But in rowing 
both hands are used to pull towards 
you. As long as the oar was used at 
an acute angle vertically to the boat's 
side, the position of the upper hand 
on the oar would have to be reversed, 

as it would more easily grasp the oar with the wrist turned 
inward towards the body. In many of the earlier representations 
of rowing this position of the upper hand seems to be indicated. 
This distinction should not be lost sight of, as the position of 
the hands on the oar affects not only the character of the stroke, 
but also the requirements as to the length of the oar and the 
breadth of the blade. The form of the oars given in the repre- 
sentations of early Egyptian ships is suggestive of paddles used 
as oars. Paddle-shaped also are the oars of the Phoenician 
ships shown on the Assyrian sculptures at Koyunjik (Layard), 
the date of which is about 700 B.C. The same form is seen on 
some of the early vases, but in some that are attributed to two 
centuries later the form is modified, and the oar blade proper 
begins to take shape. 

The types exhibited in the representations of the Roman 
galleys are generally heavy and clumsy enough in appearance. 
Still they are veritable oars, not paddles. The material of 
which the ancient oars were usually made was pine, which 
then, as now, was most suitable for the purpose, being tough 
and comparatively light and easily shaped as regards loom 
and blade. 

The oars of the Attic trireme were, if we may judge by those 
of which only we have the measurement recorded, not much 
longer for the upper bank than those of a modern racing eight, 
while those of the middle and lower banks could not have been 
much longer than those used now in the whalers and dinghies 
of the Royal Navy. As the oarsmen on either side probably sat 
in the same vertical plane, the inboard portion of the oars 
amidships was longer than the inboard of those fore and aft, 
having to conform to the curvature of the vessel's sides (cf. 
Aristotle, Mechanica, v.). No doubt in vessels of larger size 
the upper tiers of oars would be longer, and, if we are to 
believe Callixenus, as cited by Athenaeus, in the great ship 
of Ptolemy the oars of the upper tier were over 50 ft. in length 
with handles leaded so as to equalize the weight* inboard and 
outboard. 

It is difficult to trace any detail of difference between the 
oars of the Roman period and those of the Byzantine and 
medieval galleys. In the medieval galley by the invention of the 
" apostis," a framework on which the thowls were fixed, sufficient 
room was given for the play of longer oars, and, as the necessity 
of combining speed with greater carrying power in the galley 
became pressing, the arrangement alia scaloccio came into vogue, 
employing four or five or even seven men to each of the long

Notes. — (1) Since 1893 some curved or spoon-bladed oars have been made at Devonport. 
(2) There is no record of buttons being used, but on fir oars, which were covered with canvas 
on the loom, it was sometimes customary to work a Turk's head at the end of the canvas for 
ornament. (3) As regards sweeps, they used to be made of ash and were 30 ft. long. They 
were used last in training brigs, but there is no record of them for the last twenty years. 

sweeps by which the galleys and galleasses were propelled. 
For these large oars we hear of ash and beech being used as 
well as pine. 

In the Mediterranean the galley propelled by oars long re- 
mained the principal type of war vessel. In the Atlantic, and 
in the northern seas, it was otherwise. 

The employment of artillery on board ship gradually deter- 
mined a change in the method of propulsion. The use of sails 
became necessary, and remained dominant until the introduction 
of steam (see Ship). But as late as the time of the Spanish 
Armada, and even later, large sea-going vessels were provided 
with long sweeps which came into use when sailing was not 
available. In our own time, in the lighters on tidal rivers, may 
be seen long oars, plied by one or two or more men, which recall 
the type of oars once in general use in large galleys three centuries 
ago. 

The oars used by the Northmen were, to judge by the remains 
discovered along with old Viking ships l at Gokstad and else- 
where, very similar to those in use at the present time in the 
fishing boats around our coasts. Those of the large craft were, 
to judge by the length of one found whole, somewhat over 18 ft. 
in length with a 5-in. blade and a diameter of 3 in. halfway 
down the loom. Some smaller oars, evidently used for boats, 
measured 11 ft. with a 4-in. blade. The oars were of pine, and 
the looms of some of them showed a groove cut for a clamp at 
the place where the oar rested on the sill of the rowlock. Com- 
paring these oars with the measurements given below of oars 
now in use in the Royal Navy, it is apparent that there is no 
great difference in type between them. 

Passing on to oars used on rivers and fresh water generally, 
we find the type differs considerably from that of the oars used 
in sea-going craft. The chief difference consists in the shape of 
the blade, which, instead of continuing the straight line of the 
loom in its expansion to its proper breadth, is fashioned in a 
curve calculated to offer a rigid resistance to the water during 
the stroke. 2 The loom below the button is not rounded but is 
more of an oval to the front with a flat back. From the oval 
front a spine runs down into the blade, in some cases to nearly 
half its length. During the last few years the so-called " girder " 
oars, with much thicker looms but double grooved along their 
length, have been used for racing purposes. This invention 
gives additional strength and stiffness, without increasing the 
weight of the oar, which varies a little but is usually about 8 lb. 
The blades vary much in breadth, as indeed do the oars in total 
length, and in proportion of inboard to outboard. The neces- 
sities of the sliding seat in racing boats have given rise to much 
difference of opinion among rowing men as to the right proportion. 
In the middle of the 19th century the use of square looms 
inboard, and of a button to turn inside and against the thowl, 
was common, and most oars had a small slab of hard wood let in 
below the button, so as .to save the oar from wear and tear at 
the rowlock. But since round looms came into vogue the round 
leather ear has taken the place of the old square button, and the 
loom is covered with leather for some inches above and below 
this so as to protect it from abrasion. 

Of late the introduction of swivel rowlocks for racing boats 
has caused a further modification in the form of buttons. Swivel 
rowlocks have come into general use for sculling boats, pair oars 
and coxswainless fours. But as yet they do not appear to have 
captured the racing eight, except in a few instances. Neither 
crews nor coaches in English waters seem inclined to part with 
the time-honoured rhythmic music of the oar in the rowlock, 
which from the days of antiquity even until now has, to practised 
ears, told its own tale as to the crew being together or not in the 
stroke. 

In the case of racing eights, when the round loom oars 
superseded the square loom, the early patterns were com- 
monly {e.g. in 1857) 12' 6* over all, 3' 8* inboard, with a 
long blade 4 J* to 5* in breadth. These were succeeded by 
a pattern 12' 6* over all, 3' 6* inboard, with a much shorter 
blade 6* broad. 

Since sliding seats came in the average oar has been 12' 4* 
over all, 3' 8£* inboard, with $\" to 6\" blades. The modern 
racing oar may be said to date from 1869, the year of the Oxford 
and Harvard race at Putney. Until very lately no material 
alteration had taken place in this pattern, except in the matter 
of width oi blade. Some authorities, however, are, as has been

Single grooved oars were first made in America. But with 
the single groove a side weakness is often developed in the loom, 
and hence the double girder, invented by G. Ayling, has generally 
superseded the single groove, though many oarsmen prefer the 
box loom by the same inventor. 

It is clear, however, that no finality has been reached in the 
making of oars. Tubular oars, first introduced at Henley by 
the Belgian crew in 1906, are now being tried, with circular or 
quadrangular bores, strengthened by the insertion of an 
aluminium shell. 

For much of the information above given respecting the recent 
developments in oar-making for racing purposes and river work, 
the writer is indebted to Messrs Ayling & Sons of Putney, whose 
patented inventions and improvements are well known to rowing 
men. (E. Wa.) 


OASIS (Gr. 6a<ns, the name given by Herodotus to the fertile 
spots in the Libyan desert: it probably represents an Egyptian 
word, cf. Coptic ouahe, ouih, to dwell, from which the Egyptian 
Arabic wa is derived), a fertile spot surrounded by desert. For 
example, where the high plateau of the Libyan desert descends 
into a longitudinal valley between Syrtis and the Nile delta there 
are a few spots where the water comes to the surface or is found 
in shallow wells. It may come to the surface in springs, upon 
the artesian principle, or it may collect and remain in mountain 
hollows. These areas are of small extent and are closely culti- 
vated, and support thick forests of date-palms. All kinds of 
tropical vegetables, grains and small 'fruits grow under cultiva- 
tion, and land is so precious in these limited areas of great 
richness and fertility that very narrow pathways divide each 
owner's plot from his neighbour's. Wherever oases are found 
they present similar features, and are naturally the halting-places 
and points of departure of desert caravans. 


OAST (0. Eng. dst, cf. Dutch eest, " kiln "; the Teutonic root is 
aidh- " to burn"; the pre-Teutonic idh- is seen in Lat. aestus, 
" heat," castas, " summer," Gr. aWos, "burning heat"), a kiln, 
particularly one used for drying hops; the word usually appears 
in the term " oast-house," a building containing several of such 
kilns (see Hop). " Oast " is also sometimes used of a kiln for 
drying tobacco. 


OASTLER, RICHARD (1789-1861), English reformer, was 
born at Leeds ^n the 20th of December 1789, and in 1820 suc- 
ceeded his fathei as steward of the ThornhmV extensive Fixby 
estates at Huddersfield, Yorkshire. In 1830 John Wood, a 
Bradford manufacturer, called Oastler's attention to the evils 
of child employment in the factories of the district. Oastler 
at once started a campaign against the existing labour conditions 
by a vigorous letter, under the title " Yorkshire Slavery," to 
the Leeds Mercury, Public opinion was eventually aroused, 
and, after many years of agitation, in which Oastler played a* 
leading part, the Ten Hours Bill and other Factory Acts were 
passed, Oastler's energetic advocacy of the factory- workers' 
cause procuring him the title of " The Factory King." In 1838, 
however, owing to his opposition to the new poor law and his 
resistance of the commissioners, he had been dismissed from 
his stewardship at Fixby; and, in 1840, being unable to 
repay £2000 which he owed his late employer, Thomas 
Thornhill, he was sent to the Fleet prison, where he re- 
mained for over three years. From prison he published the 
Fleet Papers, a weekly paper devoted to the discussion "of 
factory and poor-law questions. In 1844 his friends raised a 
fund to pay his debt, and on his release he made a triumphant 
entry into Huddersfield. Oastler died at Harrogate on the 22nd 
of August 1861. A statue to his memory was erected at Bradford 
in 1869. 

OAT (O. Eng. die; the word is not found in cognate languages; 
it may be allied with Fr. eitel, knot, nodule, cf. Gr. ot8os 
swelling), a cereal (Avena saliva) belonging to the tribe Avenea' 
of the order Gramineae or grasses. The genus Avena contains 
about fifty species mostly dispersed through the temperate 
regions of the Old World. The spikelets form a loose panicle, 
familiar in the cultivated oat (fig. i), the flowering glume having 
its dorsal rib prolonged into an awn (fig. 2), which is in some 
species twisted and bent near the base. 

The origin of the cultivated oat is generally believed to be 
A.fatua,0T" wild oat," or some similar species, of which several 

exist in southern Europe and 
western Asia. Professor J. 
Buckman succeeded in raising 
" the potato-oat type " and 
" the white Tatarian oat " 
from grain of this species. 
A. strigosa, Schreh, "the 
bristle-pointed oat," is the 
origin of the Scotch oat, 
according to Buckman. The 
white and black varieties of 
this species were cultivated 
in England and Scotland from 
remote times, and are still 
grown as a crop in Orkney and 
Shetland. A. strigosa is prob- 
ably only a variety of the cul- 
tivated oat. The " naked oat," 
A. nuda, was found by Bunge 
in waste ground about Peking; 
it was identified by the 
botanist Lindley with the pil- 
corn of the old agriculture, 
and we see from Rogers x that 
it was in cultivation in England 
in the 13th century. Both 
this and the " common otes," 
A. vesca, are described by Gerard. 2 Parkinson tells us that in his 
time (early in the 17th century) the naked oat was sown in sundry 
places, but " nothing so frequent " as the common sort. The 
chief differences between A. fatua and A. saliva, are, that 
in the former the chaff-scales which adhere to the grain are 
thick and hairy, and in the latter they are not so coarse and 
are hairless. The wild oat, moreover, has a long stiff awn, 
usually twisted near the base. In the cultivated oat it may 
be wanting, and if present it is not so stiff and is seldom 
bent. The grain is very small and worthless in the one, but 
larger and full in the other. There are now many varieties of 
the cultivated oat included under two principal races — common

oat or panicled oats with a spreading panicle, A^sativa proper, 
and Tatarian oats or banner oats which has sometimes been 
regarded as a distinct species, A. orientalis, with contracted 
one-sided panicles. With regard to the antiquity of the oat, 
A. de Candolle 3 observes that it was not cultivated by the 
Hebrews, the Egyptians, the ancient Greeks and the Romans. 
Central Europe appears to be the locality where it was cultivated 
earliest, at least in Europe, for grains have been found among

the remains of the Swiss lake-dwellings perhaps not earlier than 
the bronze age, while Pliny alludes to bread made of it hy the 
ancient Germans. Pickering also records Galen's observations 
{De Alim. Fac. i. 14), that it was ahundant in Asia Minor, 
especially Mysia, where it was made into bread as well as given 
to horses. 

Besides the use of the straw when cut up and mixed with other 
food for fodder, the oat grain constitutes an important food for 
both man and beast. The oat grain (excepting the naked oat), 
like that of barley, is closely invested by the husk. Oatmeal 
is made from the kiln-dried grain from which the husks have been 
removed ; and the form of the food is the well-known" porridge." 
In Ireland, where it is sometimes mixed with Indian-corn meal, 
it is called " stirabout." Groats or grits are the whole kernel 
from which the husk is removed. Their use is for gruel, which 
used to be consumed as an ordinary drink in the 17th century 
at the coffee-houses in London. The meal can be baked into 
" cake " or biscuit, as the Passover cake of the Jews; but it 
cannot be made into loaves in consequence of the great difficulty 
in rupturing the starch grains, unless the temperature be raised 
to a considerable height. With regard to the nutritive value 
of oatmeal, as compared with that of wheat flour, it contains 
a higher percentage of albuminoids than any other grain, viz. 
12-6 — that of wheat being io-8 — and less of starch, 58-4 as 
against 66-3 in wheat. It has rather more sugar, viz. 5-4 — wheat 
having 4-2 — and a good deal more fat, v\z. 5-6, as against 2-0 
in flour. Lastly, salts amount to 3-0% in oat, but are only 1*7 
in wheat. Its nutritive value, therefore, is higher than that of 
ordinary seconds flour. 


OATES, TITUS (1649-1705), English conspirator, was the son 
of Samuel Oates (1610-1683), an Anabaptist preacher, chaplain 
to Pride, and afterwards rector of All Saints' Church, Hastings. 
He was admitted on the nth of June 1665 to Merchant Taylors' 
school, having, according to one authority, been previously 
at Oakham. There he remained a year, more or less, and 
" seems afterwards to have gone to Sedlescombe school in 
Sussex, from whence he passed to Caius College, Cambridge, 
on the 29th of June 1667, and was admitted a sizar of St John's, 
on the 2nd of February 1 668-1 669, aged 18." Upon very 
doubtful authority he is stated to have been also at Westminster 
school hefore going to the university. On leaving the university 
he apparently took Anglican orders, and officiated in several 
parishes, Hastings among them. Having brought malicious 
charges in which his evidence was rejected, he narrowly escaped 
prosecution for perjury. He next obtained a chaplaincy in the 
navy, from which he appears to have been speedily dismissed 
for bad conduct with the reputation of worse. He now, it 
is said, applied for help to Dr Israel Tonge, rector of St Michael's 
in Wood Street, an honest half-crazy man, who even then was 
exciting people's minds by giving out quarterly " treatises in 
print to alarm and awake his majesty's subjects." Oates 
offered his help, and it was arranged that he should pretend to 
he a Roman Catholic so as the better to unearth the Jesuit 
plots which possessed Tonge's brain. Accordingly he was 
received into the church by one Berry, himself an apostate, 
and entered the Jesuit College of Valladolid as Brother Ambrose. 
Hence he was soon expelled. In October 1677 he made a second 
application, and was admitted to St Omer on 10th December. 
So scandalous, however, was his conduct that he was finally 
dismissed in 1678. Returning in June 1678 to Tonge, he set 
himself to forge a plot by piecing together things true and false, 
or true facts falsely interpreted, and by inventing treasonable 
letters and accounts of preparations for military action. The 
whole story was written by Oates in Greek characters, copied 
into English by Tonge, and finally told to one of Charles II.'s 
confidential servants named Kirkby. Kirkby having given the 
king his information, Oates was sent for (13th August), and in 
a private interview gave details, in forty-three articles, of the 
plot and the persons who had engaged to assassinate Charles. 
The general improbability of the story was so manifest, and 
the discrepancies were so glaring, that neither then nor at any 
subsequent time did Charles express anything but amused 
incredulity. To bolster up the case a fresh packet of five forged 
letters was concocted (31st August); but the forgery was trans- 
parent, and even Sir William Jones, the attorney-general, 
though a violent upholder of the plot, dared not produce them 
as evidence. 

Oates now (6th September) made an affidavit before Sir 
Edmond Berry Godfrey (q.v.) to an improved edition of his 
story, in eighty-one articles. Among the persons named was 
Coleman, secretary to the duchess of York, whom Godfrey 
knew, and to whom he sent word of the charges. Coleman 
in turn informed the duke, and he, since the immediate exposure 
of the plot was of the utmost consequence to him, induced 
Charles to compel Oates to appear (28th September) before the 
privy council. Here Oates delivered himself of a story the 
falsehood of which was so obvious that the king was able to 
expose him by a few simple questions. At this moment an 
accident most fortunate for Oates took place. Amongst the 
papers seized at his request were Coleman's, and in them 
were found copies of letters written by the latter to Pere la 
Chaise, suggesting that Louis should furnish him with money, 
which he would use in the French and Catholic interest among 
members of parliament. Among them, too, were these passages: 
" Success will give the greatest blow to the Protestant religion 
that it has received since its birth "; " we have here a mighty 
work upon our hands, no less than the conversion of three 
kingdoms, and by that perhaps the utter subduing of a pestilent 
heresy, which has so long domineered over great part of the 
northern world." The credit of Oates was thus, in the eyes of 
the people, re-established, and Coleman and others named were 
imprisoned. Charles was anxious for his brother's sake to bring 
the matter to a conclusion, but he dared not appear to stifle 
the plot; so, when starting for Newmarket, he left orders with 
Danby (see Leeds, Duke of,) that he should finish the investiga- 
tion at once. But Danby purposely delayed; an impeachment 
was hanging over his head, and anything which took men's 
minds off that was welcome. 

On the 1 2th of October occurred the murder of Godfrey, and 
the excitement was at its highest pitch. On the 21st of October 
parliament met, and, though Charles in his speech had barely 
alluded to the plot, all other business was put aside and Oates 
was called before the House. A new witness was wanted to 
support Oates's story, and in November a man named William 
Bedloe came forward. At first he remembered little; by degrees 
he remembered everything that was wanted. Not even so, 
however, did their witness agree together, so, as a bold stroke, 
Oates, with great circumstantiality, accused the queen before 
Charles of high treason. Charles both disbelieved and exposed 
him, whereupon Oates carried his tale before the House of 
Commons. The Commons voted for the queen's removal from 
court, but, the Lords refusing to concur, the matter dropped. 
It was not, however, until the 18th of July 1679 that the slaughter 
of Jesuits and other Roman Catholics upon Oates's testimony 
and that of his accomplices was to some extent checked. Sir 
George Wakeman, the queen's physician, was accused of pur- 
posing to poison the king, and the queen was named as being 
concerned in the plot. The refusals of Charles to credit or to 
countenance the attacks on his wife are the most creditable 
episodes in his life. Scroggs had intimation that he was to be 
lenient. Sir Philip Lloyd proved Oates to have perjured himself 
in open court, and Wakeman was acquitted. On the 26th of 
June 1680, upon Oates's testimony, the duke of York was pre- 
sented as a recusant at Westminster. But the panic had now 
worn itself out, and the importance of Oates rapidly declined; 
so much so that after the dissolution in 1682 he was no more 
heard of during Charles's reign, but enjoyed his pension of £600 
or £900, it is uncertain which, in quiet. Shortly before the 
death of Charles, James brought, and won, a civil action against 
Oates, with damages of £roo,ooo; in default of payment Oates 
was taken to prison; while there he was indicted for perjury, 
and was tried in May 1685, soon after the accession of James II. 
He was convicted and received a severe sentence, with repeated 
floggings, the execution of which was expected to kill him, and 
which was rigorously carried out; but to the astonishment of 
all he survived. 

Oates was in prison for three and a half years. Upon the 
flight of James, and during the excitement against the Catholics, 
he partially gained his liberty, and brought an appeal against 
his sentence before the Lords, who, while admitting the sentence 
to be unjust, confirmed it by a majority of thirty-five to twenty- 
three. The Commons, however, passed a bill annulling the 
sentence; and a conference was held in which the Lords, while 
again acknowledging that legally they were wrong, adhered to 
their former determination. The matter was finally settled by 
Oates receiving a royal pardon, with a pension of £300 a year. 
The remainder of his life was spent in retirement, varied by a 
good deal of sordid intrigue. In 1691 he became acquainted 
with William Fuller, whom he induced to forge another plot, 
though not with the success he had himself attained. He 
married a wealthy widow in 1693, but his extravagance soon 
brought him into straits. In 1696 he dedicated to William III. 
a book called Eikon Basilike, an elaborate tissue of invection 
against " the late king James." In 1698 he obtained admission 
as a member of the Baptist Church, and used to preach at 
Wapping; but in 1701, as the result of a financial scandal, he 
was formally expelled from the sect. He died on the 12th of 
July 1705.

OATH (0. Eng. ddh), a term which may be defined as an asse- 
veration or promise made under non-human penalty or sanction. 
The word is found throughout the Teutonic languages (Goth, 
aithSy Mod. Ger. Eid) } hut without ascertainable etymology. 
The verb to swear is also Old Teutonic (Goth, svaran, Mod. Ger. 
schworen) ; this word, too, is not clear in original meaning, but 
is in some way connected with the notion of answering — indeed 
it still forms part of the word answer, 0. Eng. and-swarian; it has 
been suggested that the swearer answered by word or gesture 
to a solemn formula or act. Among other terms in this con- 
nexion, the Lat. jurare, whence English law has such derivatives 
z.s jury, seems grounded on the metaphorical idea of binding 
(root/tt, as mjunga); the similar idea of a bond or restraint may 
perhaps be traced in Gr. 6p*os, It may be worth notice that 
Lat. sacramentum (whence Mod. Fr. sermenl) does not really 
imply the sacredness of an oath, but had its origin in the money 
paid into court in a Roman lawsuit, the loser forfeiting his 
pledge, which went to pay for the public rites (sacra); thence 
the word passed to signify other solemn pledges, such as military 
and judicial oaths. 

Writers viewing the subject among civilized nations only 
have sometimes defined the oath as an appeal to a deity. It will 
be seen, however, by some following examples, that the harm or 
penalty consequent on perjury may be considered to result 
directly, without any spirit or deity being mentioned; indeed 
it is not unlikely that these mere direct cursesjnvoked on himself 
by the swearer may be more primitive than the invocation of 
divinities to punish. Examples of the simplest kind of curse- 
oath may be seen among the Nagas of Assam, where two men 
will lay hold of a dog or a fowl by head and feet, which is then 
chopped in two with a single blow of the dao, this being em- 
blematic of the fate expected to befall the perjurer. Or a man 
will stand within a circle of rope, with the implication that if he 
breaks his vow he may rot as a rope does, or he will take hold of 
the barrel of a gun, a spear-head or a tiger's tooth, and solemnly 
declare, " If I do not faithfully perform this my promise, may I 
fall by this!" (Butler in Journ. Astatic Soc. Bengal, 1875, p. 316), 
Another stage in the history of oaths is that in which the swearer 
calls on some fierce beast to punish him if he lies, believing that 
it has the intelligence to know what he says and the power to 
interfere in his affairs. In Siberia, in lawsuits between Russians 
and the wild Ostiaks, it is described as customary to bring into 
court the head of a bear, the Ostiak making the gesture of eating, 
and calling on the bear to devour him in like manner if he does 
not tell the truth (G. A. Erman, Travels in Siberia, i. 492, 
London, 1848). Similar oaths are still sworn on the head or 
skin of a tiger by the Santals and other indigenous tribes of 
India. . To modem views, a bear or a tiger seems at any rate a 
more rational being to appeal to than a river or the sun, but in 
the earlier stage of nature-religion these and other great objects 
of nature are regarded as animate and personal. The prevalence 
of river- worship is seen in the extent to which in the old and 
modern world oaths by rivers are most sacred. In earlier ages 
men swore inviolably by Styx or Tiber, and to this day an 
oath on water of the Ganges is to the Hindu the most binding of 
pledges, for the goddess will take awful vengeance on the children 
of the perjurer. The Tungus brandishes a knife before the sun, 
saying, " If I lie may the sun plunge sickness into my entrails 
like this knife." The natural transition from swearing by these 
great objects of nature to invoking gods conceived in human 
form is well shown in the treaty-oath between the Macedonians 
and the Carthaginians recorded by Polybius (vii. 9); here the 
sun and moon and earth, the rivers and meadows and waters, 
are invoked side by side with Zeus and Hera and Apollo, and 
the gods of the Carthaginians. The heaven-god, able to smite 
the perjurer with his lightning, was invoked by the Romans, 
when a hog was slain with the sacred flint representing the 
thunderbolt, with the invocation to Jove so to smite the Roman 
people if they broke the oath (Liv. i. 24; Polyb. iii. 25). Another 
form of this Aryan rite was preserved by the old Slavonic nation 
of Prussia, where a man would lay his right hand on his own 
neck and his left on the holy oak, saying, " May Perkun (the 
thunder-god) destroy me!" The oaths of the lower culture 
show a remarkable difference from those of later stages. In the 
apparently primitive forms the curse on the perjurer is to take 
effect in this world. But as nations became more observant, 
experience must have shown that bears and tigers were as apt 
to kill truth-tellers as perjurers, and that even the lightning- 
flash falls without moral discrimination. In the Clouds of 
Aristophanes, indeed, men have come openly to ridicule such 
beliefs, the Socrates of the play pointing out that notorious 
perjurers go unharmed, while Zeus hurls his bolts at his own 
temple, and the tall oaks, as if an oak-tree could perjure itself. 
The doctrine of miraculous earthly retribution on the perjurer 
lasted on in legend, as where Eusebius relates how three villains 
conspired to bring a false accusation against Narcissus, bishop 
of Jerusalem, which accusation they confirmed by solemn oath 
before the church, one wishing that if he swore falsely he might 
perish by fire, one that he might die of the pestilence, one that 
he might lose his eyes; a spark no man knew from whence 
burned to ashes the first perjurer's house and all within, the 
second was consumed by the plague from head to foot, whereupon 
the third confessed the crime with tears so copious that he lost 
his sight (Euseb. Hist. Eccl. vi. 9). As a general rule, however, 
the supernatural retribution on perjury has been transferred 
from the present world to the regions beyond the grave, as is 
evident from any collection of customary oaths. A single 
instance will show at once the combination of retributions in 
and after the present life, and the tendency to heap up remote 
penalties in the vain hope of securing present honesty. The 
Siamese Buddhist in his oath, not content to call down on himself 
various kinds of death if he breaks it, desires that he may after- 
wards be cast into hell to go through innumerable tortures, 
among them to carry water over the flames in a wicker basket 
to assuage the thirst of the infernal judge, then that he may 
migrate into the body of a slave for as many years as there are 
grains of sand in four seas, and after this that he may be born a 
beast through five hundred generations and an hermaphrodite 
five hundred more. 

The forms of oath belonging to all nations and ages, various 
as they are in detail, come under a few general heads. It may 
be first observed that gestures such as grasping hands, or putting 
one hand between the hands of another in token of homage, are 
sometimes treated as of the nature of oaths, but wrongly so, 
they being rather of the nature of ceremonies of compact. The 
Hebrew practice of putting the hand under another's thigh is 
usually reckoned among oath-rites, but it may have been 
merely a ceremony of covenant (Gen. xxiv. 2, xlvii. 29; see 
Joseph. Ant. i. 16). Even the covenant among many ancient 
and modern nations by the parties mixing their blood or drinking 
one another's is in itself only a solemn rite of union, not an oath 
proper, unless some such ceremony is introduced as dipping 
weapons into the blood, as in the form among the ancient 
Scythians (Herod, iv. 70) ; this, by bringing in the idea of death 
befalling the covenant-breaker, converts the proceeding into an 
oath of the strongest kind. The custom of swearing by weapons, 
though frequent in the world, is far from consistent in meaning. 
It may signify, in cases such as those just mentioned, that the 
swearer if forsworn is to die by such a weapon; or the warrior 
may appeal to his weapon as a powerful or divine object, as 
Parthenopaeus swears by his spear that he will level to the 
ground the walls of Thebes (Aeschyl. Sept. contra Theb. 530; 
see the custom of the Quadi in Ammian. Marcellin. xvii.); or 
the weapon may be a divine emblem, as when the Scythians 
swore by the wind and the sword as denoting life and death 
(Lucian, Toxaris, 38) . Oaths by weapons lasted into the Christian 
period; for instance, the Lombards swore lesser oaths by 
consecrated weapons and greater on the Gospels (see Du Cange, 
s.v. " Juramenta super arma "; Grimm, Deutsche Rechtsalterth. 
p. 896). Stretching forth the hand towards the object or deity 
sworn by is a natural gesture, well shown in the oath of Agamem- 
non, who with uplifted hands (Ait x € ?pas &vaox& v ) takes Heaven 
to witness with Sun and Earth and the Erinyes who below the 
earth wreak vengeance on the perjurer (Homer II. xix. 254; 
see also Pindar, Olymp. vii. 120). The gesture of lifting the 
hand towards heaven was also an Israelite form of oath: 
Abraham says, " I have lifted up my hand to Jehovah," while 
Jehovah Himself is represented as so swearing, " For I lift up 
My hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever" (Gen. xiv. 22; 
Deut. xxxii. 40; see Dan. xii. 7; Rev. x. 5). This gesture 
established itself in Christendom, and has continued to modern 
times. In England, for example, in the parliament at Shrews- 
bury in 1398, when the Lords took an oath on the cross of 
Canterbury never to suffer the transactions of that parliament 
to be changed, the members of the Commons held up their 
hands to signify their taking upon themselves the same oath 
(J. E. Tyler, Oaths, p. 99). In France a juror takes oath by 
raising his hand, saying, "Je jure!" The Scottish judicial oath 
is taken by the witness holding up his right hand uncovered, 
and repeating after the usher, " I swear by Almighty God, and 
as I shall answer to God at the great day of judgment, that I 
will," &c. 

In the ancient world sacrifice often formed part of the ceremony 
of the oath; typical examples may be found in the Homeric poems, 
as in Agamemnon's oath already mentioned, or the compact between 
the Greeks and Trojans (//. iii. 276), where wine is poured out in 
libation, with prayer to Zeus and the immortal gods that the per- 
jurer's brains shall, like the wine, be poured on the ground; the rite 
thus passes into a symbolic curse-oath of the ordinary barbaric type. 
Connected with such sacrificial oaths is the practice of laying the 
hand on the victim or the altar, or touching the image of the god. 
A classic instance is in a comedy of Plautus (Rudens, v. 2, 45), where 
Gripus says, " Tange aram hanc Veneris," and Labrax answers 
"Tango" (Greek instance, Thucyd. v. 47; see Justin xxiv. 2). 
Thus Livy (xxi. 1) introduces the phrase " touching the sacred 
objects " {tactis sacris) into the picturesque story of Hannibal's oath. 
Details of the old Scandinavian oath have been preserved in Iceland 
in the Landnamab6k (hlendinga Sogur, Copenhagen, 1843); a 
bracelet (baugr) of two rings or more was to be kept on the altar 
in every head court, which the godi or Driest should wear at all law- 
things held by him, and should redden in the blood of the bullock 
sacrificed, the witness pronouncing the remarkable formula: " Name 
I to witness that I take oath by the ring, law-oath, so help me Frey, 
and Niord, and almighty Thor " (hialpi mer sv& Freyr, ok Ni8rdr, 
ok hinn almattki Ass), &c. This was doubtless the great oath on 
the holy ring or bracelet which the Danes swore to King Alfred to 
quit his kingdom ("on tham halgan beage," Anglo-Sax. Chron.; 

in eorum armilla sacra," Ethelwerd, Chron. iv.). An oath, though 
not necessarily expressed in words, is usually so. In the Homeric 
instances the prayer which constitutes the oath has a somewhat con- 
ventional form, and in the classical ages we find well-marked formulas. 
These are often references to deities, as " by Zeus! " " I call Zeus to 
witness" (val pa Ma: hrrw Ztbs) ;" by the immortal gods!" 
" I call to witness the ashes of my ancestors " (per deos immortales; 
testor majorum cineres). Sometimes a curse is invoked on himself 
by the swearer, that he may perish if he fail to keep his oath, as " the 
gods destroy me," "let me perish if," &c. (dii me perdant; dis- 
peream si). An important class of Roman oaths invokes the deity 
to favour or preserve the swearer in so far as he shall fulfil his promise 
— " as the gods may preserve me," " as I wish the gods to be pro- 
pitious to me" (me ita di servent; ita deos mihi velim propitios). 
The best Roman collection is to be found in the old work of Brissonius, 
De Formulis el Solemnibus Poptdi Romani Verbis (Paris, 1583). 
Biblical examples of these classes of oaths are " as the Lord liveth " 
!i Sam. xiv. 39, and elsewhere), " so do God to me, and more also " 
2 Sam. iii. 35, and elsewhere). 

The history of oaths in the early Christian ages opens a con- 
troversy which can hardly be said even yet to have closed. Under 
Christ's injunction, "Swear not at all" (Matt. v. 34; also 
James v. 12), many Christians seem at first to have shrunk from 
taking oaths, and, though after a time the usual customs of 
judicial and even colloquial oaths came to prevail among them, 
the writings of the Fathers show efforts to resist the practice. 
Chrysostom perhaps goes furthest in inveighing against this 
" snare of Satan ": " Do as you choose; I lay it down as a law 
that there be no swearing at all. If any bid you swear, tell him, 
Christ has spoken, and I do not swear " (Homil. ix. in Act. 
AposioL; see a collection of patristic passages in Sixt. Senens. 
Bibliothec. Sand. vi. adnot. 26). The line mostly taken by 
influential teachers, however, was that swearing should indeed 
be avoided as much as possible from its leading to perjury, but 
that the passages forbidding it only applied to superfluous or 
trifling oaths, or those sworn by created objects, such as heaven 
or earth or one's own head. On the other hand, they argued that 
judicial and other serious swearing could not have been forbidden, 
seeing that Paul in his epistles repeatedly introduces oaths 
(2 Cor. i. 23; Phil. i. 8; Gal. i. 20). Thus Athanasius writes: 
" I stretch out my hand, and as I have learned of the apostle, 
I call God to witness on my soul " (Apol. ad Imp. Const. ; see 
Augustine, De Mend. 28; Epist. cl. iii. 9; cl. iv. 250; Enarr. 
in Psalm, lxxxviii. (4); Serm. 307, 319). This argument is 
the more forcible from Paul's expressions being actually oaths 
in accepted forms, and it has also been fairly adduced that 
Christ, by answering to the adjuration of the high priest, took 
the judicial oath in solemn form (Matt. xxvi. 63). The passages 
here referred to will give an idea of the theological grounds on 
which in more modern times Anabaptists, Mennonites and 
Quakers have refused to take even judicial oaths, while, on the 
other hand, the laws of Christendom from early ages have been 
only directed against such swearing as was considered profane 
or otherwise improper, and against perjury. Thus from the 
- 3rd or 4th century we find oaths taking much the same place 
in Christian as in non-Christian society. In the 4th century the 
Christian military oath by God, Christ, the Holy Spirit, and the 
majesty of the emperor is recorded by Vegetius (Ret Milit. 
Inst. ii. 5). Constantine's laws required every witness in a cause 
to take oath; this is confirmed in Justinian's code, which even 
in some cases requires also the parties and advocates to be sworn 
(Cod. Theod. xi. 39; Justin. Cod. iv. 20, 59), Bishops and clergy 
were called upon to take oath in ordination, monastic vows, 
and other ecclesiastical matters (see details in Bingham, Antiq. of 
Chr. Church, xvi. 7). By the middle ages oaths had increased 
and multiplied in Christendom far beyond the practice of any 
other age or religion. The Reformation made no change in 
principle, as is seen, for instance, in Art. xxxix. of the church of 
England: " As we confess that vain and rash swearing is 
forbidden Christian men by our Lord Jesus Christ, and James 
His apostle, so we judge, that Christian Religion doth not 
prohibit, but that a man may swear when the Magistrate re- 
quireth, in a cause of faith and charity, so it be done according 
to the Prophet's teaching, in justice, judgement and truth." 

The history of swearing in early Christendom would lead us 
to expect that the forms used would be adopted with more or 
less modification from Hebrew or Roman sources, as indeed 
proves to be the case. The oath introduced in the body of one 
of Constantine's laws — " As the Most High Divinity may ever 
be propitious to me " (Ita mihi summa Divinitas semper propitia 
sit) — follows an old Roman form. The Roman oath by the genius 
of the emperor being objected to by Christians as recognizing a 
demon, they swore by his safety (Tertull. Apol. 32). The 
gesture of holding up the hand in swearing has been already 
spoken of. The Christian oath on a copy of the Gospels seems 
derived from the late Jewish oath taken holding in the hand 
the scroll of the law (or the phylacteries), a ceremony itself 
possihly adapted from Roman custom (see treatise " Shebuoth " 
in Gemara). Among the various mentions of the oath on the 
Gospels in early Christian writers is that characteristic passage 
of Chrysostom in a sermon to the people of Antioch: " But do 
thou, if nothing else, at least reverence the very book thou 
holdest forth to be sworn by, open the Gospel thou takest in 
thy hands to administer the oath, and, hearing what Christ 
therein saith of oaths, tremble and desist " (Serm. ad pop. 
Antioch. Homil. xv.). The usual mode was to lay the hand on 
the Gospel, as is often stated in the records, and was kept up to 
a modern date in the oath in the university of Oxford, " tactis 
sacrosanctis Evangeliis"; the practice of kissing the book, 
which became so well established in England, appears in the 
middle ages (J. E. Tyler, Oaths, pp. 119, 151). The book was 
often laid on the altar, or (after the manner of ancient Rome) 
the swearer laid his hand on the altar itself, or looked towards 
it; above all, it became customary to touch relics of saints on 
the altar, a ceremony of which the typical instance is .seen in the 
representation of Harold's oath in the Bayeux tapestry. Other 
objects, as the cross, the bishop's crosier, &c, were sworn by 
(see Du Cange, s.v. " Jurare "). An oath ratified by contact or 
inspection of a sacred object was called a " corporal " or bodily 
oath, as distinguished from a merely spoken or written oath; 
this is well seen in an old English coronation oath, " so helpe 
me God, and these holy euangelists by me bodily touched vppon 
this hooly awter." The English word signifying the " sacred 
object " on which oath is taken is halidome (A.S. hdligddm; 
Ger. Heiligthum)] the halidome on which oaths are now sworn 
in England is a copy of the New Testament. Jews are sworn 
on the Old Testament; the sacred books of other religions are 
used in like manner, a Mohammedan swearing on the Koran, 
a Hindu on the Vedas. 

Among the oath-formulas used in Christendom, that taken 
by provincial governors under Justinian is typical of one class: 
" I swear by God Almighty, and His only begotten Son our Lord 
Jesus Christ, and the Holy Ghost, and the Most Holy Glorious 
Mother of God and ever Virgin Mary, and by the Four Gospels 
which I hold in my hand, and by the Holy Archangels Michael 
and Gabriel," &c. The famous oath of the kings Louis and 
Charles at Strassburg in 842 (a.d.) runs: " By God's love and 
the Christian people and our common salvation, as God shall give 
me knowledge and power," &c. Earlier than this, as in the oath 
of fealty in the capitularies of Charlemagne in 802, is found the 
familiar form " Sic me adjuvet Deus," closely corresponding to 
above-mentioned formulas of pre-Christian Rome. This became 
widely spread in Europe, appearing in Old French " Si m'ait 
Dex," German " So mir Gott helfe," English " So help me God." 
A remarkable point in its history is its occurrence in the " So 
help me Frey," &c, of the old Scandinavian ring-oath already 
described. Among the curiosities of the subject are quaint oaths 
of kings and other great personages: William Rufus swore " by 
that and that " (per hoc et per hoc), William the Conqueror 
" by the splendour of God," Richard I. " by God's legs," John 
" by God's teeth "; other phrases are given in Du Cange (l.c), as 
" per omnes gentes," " per coronam," " par la sainte figure de 
Dieu," " par la mort Dieu," &c. 

Profane swearing, the trifling or colloquial use of sacred 
oaths, is not without historical interest, formulas used being apt 
to keep up traces of old manners and extinct religions. Thus the 
early Christians were reproved for continuing to say " tnehcrclel " 
some of them not knowing that they were swearing by Hercules 
(Tertull. De idol. 20). Oaths by deities of pre-Christian Europe 
lasted into the modern world, as when a few generations ago 
Swedish peasants might be heard to swear, " Odin take me if 
it is not true I" (Hylten-Cavallius, WUrend och Wirdarne, 
i. 228). The thunder-god holds his place still in vulgar German 
exclamations, such as "Donner I" (Grimm. Deutsche Mythologie, 
pp. 10, 166). The affected revival of classical deities in Italy in 
the middle ages still lingers in such forms as "per Bacco!" 
" cospetto di Bacco I" (by Bacchus! face of Bacchus!). In 
France the concluding oath of the last paragraph dwindled into 
" mordieu I" or " morbleu I" much as in England the old oaths 
by God's body and wounds became converted into " oddsbodi- 
kins ! " and " zounds 1 " (E. B. T.) 

Law. — Politicians and moralists have placed much reliance 
on oaths as a practical security. It has been held, as Lycurgus 
the orator said to the Athenians, that " an oath is the bond that 
keeps the state together " (Lycurg. Leocr. 80; see Montesquieu, 
Spirit of Laws). Thus modern law-books quote from the leading 
case of Omichund v. Barker: " No country can subsist a twelve- 
month where an oath is thought not binding; for the want of 
it must necessarily dissolve society." On the other hand, 
wherever the belief in supernatural interference becomes weak- 
ened, and oaths are taken with solemn form but secret contempt 
or open ridicu T e, they become a serious moral scandal, as had 
already begun to happen in classical times. The yet more 
disastrous effect of the practice of swearing is the public infer- 
ence that, if a man has to swear in order to be believed, he need 
not speak the truth when not under oath. The early Christian 
fathers were alive to this depreciation of ordinary truthfulness 
by the practice of swearing, and opposed, though unavailingly, 
the system of oaths which more and more pervaded public 
business. How in the course of the middle ages oaths were 
multiplied is best seen by examining a collection of formulas 
such as the Book of Oaths (London, 1649), which range from 
the coronation oath to the oaths sworn by such as valuers of 
cloths and the city scavengers. 1 Oaths of allegiance and other 
official oaths are still taken throughout Europe, but experience 
shows that in times of revolution they are violated with little 
scruple, and in the case of the United Kingdom it is doubtful 
whether they have any more practical value than, if so much as, 
simple declarations. The question of legal oaths is more difficult. 
On the one hand, it is admitted that they do induce witnesses, 
especially the ignorant and superstitious, to give evidence more 
truthfully than they would do on even solemn declaration. On 
the other hand, all who practise in courts of justice declare 
that a large proportion of the evidence given under oath is 
knowingly false, and that such perjury is perceptibly detri- 
mental to public morals. 

The oaths now administered among civilized nations are 
chiefly intended for maintaining governments and securing the 
performance of public business. In England the coronation 
oath is to be administered by one of the archbishops or bishops 
in the presence of all the people, who, on their parts, reciprocally 
take the oath of allegiance to the crown. The archbishop or 
bishop shall say : " Will you solemnly promise and swear to 
govern the people of this United Kingdom of Great Britain and 
Ireland and the dominions thereto belonging according to the 
statutes in parliament agreed on, and the respective laws and cus- 
toms of the same?" The king shall say: " I solemnly promise 
so to do." Archbishop or bishop: " Will you to the utmost of 
your power cause law and justice, in mercy, to be executed in 
all your judgements?" King: " I will." Archbishop or bishop: 
" Will you, to the utmost of your power, maintain the laws of 
God, the true profession of the Gospel, and the Protestant re- 
formed religion established by law? And will you maintain 
and preserve inviolably the settlement of the Church of England 
and the doctrine, worship, discipline and government thereof, 
■as by law established in England. And will you preserve unto 
the bishops and clergy of England, and to the churches therein 
all such rights and privileges as by law do or shall appertain to 
them, or any of them?" King: "All this I promise to do." 

[1] As to reform of the excessive multiplication of oaths, see Paley, 
Moral Philosophy, bk. iii. pt. i. ch. 16; and J. E. Tyler, Oaths. 

After this the king, laying his hand upon the holy Gospels, shall 
say : " The things which I have here before promised I will 
perform and keep; so help me God," and then shall kiss the 
book. 

The chief officers of state take an " official " oath well and 
truly to serve his majesty. Special oaths are taken by privy 
councillors, archbishops and bishops, peers, baronets and knights, 
recruits and others. The old oath of allegiance, as administered 
(says Blackstone) upwards of 600 years, contained a promise 
" to be true and faithful to the king and his heirs, and truth and 
faith to bear of life and limb and terrene honour, and not to 
know or hear of any ill or damage intended him without defend- 
ing him therefrom " (Blackstone, Commentaries , book i. chap, 
x.). In the reign of William III. it was replaced by a shorter 
form; and it now runs: "I . . . do swear that I will be 
faithful and bear true allegiance to His Majesty . . . , his heirs 
and successors, according to law." Statutes of Charles II. and 
George I. enacted that no member should vote or sit in either 
house of parliament without having taken the several oaths 
of allegiance, supremacy and abjuration. The oath of supremacy 
in the reign of William III. was: " I A B doe swear that I doe 
from my heart abhorr detest and abjure as impious and hereticall 
this damnable doctrine and position that princes excommuni- 
cated or deprived by the pope or any authority of the see of 
Rome may be deposed or murdered by their subjects or any 
other whatsoever. And I doe declare that no forreigne prince 
person prelate state or potentate hath or ought to have any 
jurisdiction power superiority preeminence or authoritie ecclesi- 
asticall or spirituall within this realme. Soe," &c. The oath 
of abjuration introduced in the time of William III. recognizes 
the king's rights, engages the juror to support him and disclose 
all traitorous conspiracies against him, promises to maintain 
the Hanoverian Protestant succession, and expressly renounces 
any claim of the descendants of the late Pretender. This oath 
was not only taken by persons in office, but might be tendered 
by two justices to any person suspected of disaffection. In 
modern times a single parliamentary oath was substituted for 
the three, and this was altered to enable Roman Catholics to 
take it, and Jews were enabled to sit in parliament by being 
allowed to omit the words " on the true faith .of a Christian." 
In its present form the parliamentary oath consists of an oath 
of allegiance and a promise to maintain the succession to the 
crown as limited and settled in the reign of William III. 

The "judicial" oath taken by judges of the court of appeal 
or of the High Court of Justice, and by justices of the peace, 
is " to do right to all manner of people after the laws and usages 
of this realm, without fear or favour, affection or ill-will." 
Jurors are sworn, whence indeed their name (juratores); in 
felonies the oath administered is: " You shall well and truly 
try and true deliverance make between our sovereign lord the 
king and the prisoner at the bar whom you shall have in charge, 
and a true verdict give according to the evidence." In mis- 
demeanours the form is: " Well and truly try the issue joined 
between our sovereign lord the king and the defendant, and a 
true verdict," &c. The oath of the jurors in the Scottish criminal 
courts is: " You [the jury collectively] swear in the name of 
Almighty God and as you shall answer to God at the great day 
of judgment that you will truth say and no truth conical in so> 
far as you are to pass upon this assize." The oldest trace of this 
form of oath in Scotland is in Reg. maj. i. cap. ir, copied from 
Glanvill, which points to an origin in the Norman inquest or 
" recognition." In the ancient custom of compurgation, once 
prevalent in Europe, the accused's oath was supported by the 
oaths of a number of helpers or compurgators who swore to their 
belief in its validity. 

Witnesses in English law courts must give their evidence 
under the sanction of an oath, or of what is equivalent to an 
oath, and the ordinary form of oath adapted to Christians is: 
" The evidence you shall give . . . shall be the truth, the whole 
truth, and nothing but the truth. So help you God." Many 
alterations of the English law as to oaths have been made in 
relief of (r) those Christians who object on conscientious grounds 
to the taking of an oath, and (2) of those persons who refuse 
to admit the binding force of an oath. Special provision was 
first made for Quakers, Moravians and Separatists; then 
followed general enactments relating to civil and criminal pro- 
ceedings respectively, till finally the law was embodied in the 
Oaths Act 1888, which enacted that " every person upon object- 
ing to being sworn, and stating, as the ground of such objection, 
either that he has no religious belief, or that the taking of an 
oath is contrary to his religious belief, shall be permitted to 
make his solemn affirmation instead of taking an oath in all 
places and for all purposes where an oath is or shall be required 
by law, which affirmation shall be of the same force and effect 
as if he had taken the oath; and if any person making such 
affirmation shall wilfully, falsely and corruptly affirm any 
matter or thing which, if deposed on oath, would have amounted 
to wilful and corrupt perjury, he shall be liable to prosecution, 
indictment, sentence and punishment in all respects as if he had 
committed wilful and corrupt perjury." The form of affirmation 
prescribed by the Oaths Act was as follows: "I, A. B. f do 
solemnly, sincerely, and truly declare and affirm," &c. Under 
S. 5 of the same act a person might swear in the Scottish form, 
with uplifted hand (no book of any kind being used) and if he 
desired to do so " the oath shall be administered to him in such 
form and manner without question." With the desire of making 
universal this method of administering the oath the Oaths Act 
1909 was passed. It enacted that any oath might be adminis- 
tered and taken in the following form: "The person taking 
the oath shall hold the New Testament, or in the case of a Jew, 
the Old Testament, in his uplifted hand, and shall say or repeat 
after the officer administering the oath the words ' I swear by 
Almighty God that . . . ,' followed by the words of the oath 
prescribed by law." The officer also is directed by the act to 
administer it in this fashion, unless the person about to take 
it , voluntarily objects or is physically incapable of taking it 
so. To a person who is neither a Christian nor a Jew the 
oath may be administered in any way in which it was previously 
lawful. 

The form of affirmation given above is that used for Quakers, 
Moravians and Separatists in the witness-box: "I, A. B. } being 
one of the people called Quakers (one of the United Brethren 
called Moravians), do, &c." A Christian swears on the Gospels, 
holding a copy of the New Testament in his right hand (the 
hand being uncovered), and his head being also uncovered. A 
witness may elect to be sworn on any version of the Bible which 
he considers most binding on him, as a Roman Catholic on the 
Douai Testament or Bible. A Jew is sworn on the Pentateuch, 
holding a copy thereof in his right hand, the head being covered. 
A Mahommedan is sworn upon the Koran. He places his right 
hand flat upon the book and puts the other hand upon his fore- 
head, bringing his head down to the book and in contact with 
it. He then looks at the book for some moments. Buddhists 
are sworn on the Buddhist doctrines, Sikhs upon the Granth, 
Parsees upon the Zend Avesta, Hindus upon the Vedas, or by 
touching the Brahmin's foot, and, according to caste custom, 
Indian witnesses sometimes insist upon the oath being ad- 
ministered by a Brahmin; but in India witnesses now generally 
affirm. Kaffir witnesses swear by their own chief, and a Kaffir 
chief by the king of England. When a Chinese witness is to be 
sworn, a saucer is handed to him, which he takes in his hand 
and kneeling down breaks into fragments. The colonial legis- 
latures generally make provision for receiving unsworn evidence 
of barbarous and uncivilized people who have no religious belief. 
The great number of oaths formerly required was much reduced 
by the Promissory Oaths Act 1868, which prescribed the forms 
of oath of allegiance, the official oath and the judicial oath. The 
right to affirm in lieu of taking the parliamentary oath in the 
case of atheists was first raised in the case of Charles Bradlaugh 

(g.v.). 

Profane swearing and cursing is punishable by the Profane Oaths 
Act 1745, any labourer, sailor or soldier being liable to forfeit 
is., every other person under the degree of a gentleman 2s. t and 
every gentleman or person of superior rank 5s. t to the poor of the 
parish. 

The administering or taking of unlawful oaths is criminal in English 
and Scots law. Statutes relating to the offence were passed in 1 797, 
1799, 1810 and 1812, and it is evident from the preamble of the 
latter act (Unlawful Oaths Act 1812) that they were aimed at those 
societies in the United Kingdom at the time of the French Revolu- 
tion which required or permitted their members to take an unlawful 
oath. Supplementary statutes were passed in 1817 and 1837. 
Children of tender years, who, in the opinion of the court, have not 
sufficient intelligence to understand the nature of an oath, may give 
evidence without being sworn. 

In the United States an oath is required in practically every case 
in which it is required in the United Kingdom, and with the same 
latitude as to affirmation. The formula or details may vary in 
different states of the Union. The same may be said generally of 
every civilized country, with the reservation that an affirmation 
is not so usually accepted as in English-speaking countries. In 
Germany an oath is compulsory on a witness in criminal cases, 
except in the case of certain sects, whose tenets forbid the taking 
of an oath.

OAXACA, or Oajaca (officially Oaxaca de JtjArez), a 
southern state of Mexico, lying partly on the southern slope of 
the great Mexican plateau and covering the southern and larger 
part of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, bounded N. by Puebla, 
N.E. and E. by Vera Cruz, S.E. by Chiapas, S. by the Pacific 
and W. by Guerrero. Pop. (1000) 948,633, a large majority 
of whom are Indians. The state has an area of 35,382 sq. m. 
broken by mountain ranges into numerous broad fertile valleys, 
chiefly lying in the tierra templada region. The isthmus districts, 
however, have lower elevations and are distinctly tropical. The 
coast line is 329 m. long; behind it is a narrow strip of lowlands 
lying within the tierras calientes. In places this strip nearly 
disappears, the sierras rising almost immediately from the sea- 
shore. The culminating points within the state are Zempoalte- 
petl (11,145 ft-) about 50 m. E. by N. of the city of Oaxaca in a 
knot of sierras, San Felipe del Agua (10,253 ft.) standing on the 
eastern margin of the beautiful Oaxaca Valley, and the Cerro 
del Leone, south-west of Tehuantepec, the highest summit in 
the Sierra Madre del Sur. Tributaries of the Mescala drain the 
western quarter of the state, among which is the Atoyac or 
headstream of the Mescala, which rises in Tlaxcala, and flows 
across the state of Puebla. The streams flowing northward to 
the Gulf coast are the Coatzacoalcos and Papaloapam with its 
tributary, the San Juan, all flowing across the state of Vera 
Cruz. The Papaloapam is navigable up to the town of Tuxtepec, 
in the state of Oaxaca. The largest of the Pacific coast streams 
is the Tehuantepec, which with its many tributaries has an 
aggregate length of 182 m. The Rio Verde has its source farther 
inland and drains the Oaxaca Valley, but its tributaries are 
small and less numerous. The only ports on the coast open to 
foreign trade are Salina Cruz and Puerto Angel — the first, the 
Pacific terminus of the Tehuantepec railway, with a spacious 
artificial harbour, and the second a deep but narrow natural 
harbour, the projected coast terminus of the Mexican Southern 
railway. The greater part of the state has a sub-tropical climate, 
with high sun temperatures, moderate rainfall and mild, healthful 
conditions. The less healthful regions include the isthmus 
districts, the coastal zone on the Pacific and the low country on 
the border of Vera Cruz. Agriculture is the principal occupation 
of the people; the chief products are Indian corn, wheat, coffee, 
sugar, rubber, cotton, cacao, tobacco, indigo and a great 
variety of tropical fruits. Among the manufactured products 
are cotton, woollen and " pita " fibre fabrics, sugar, rum, mescal, 
beer, furniture, pottery, soap, candles, leather, matches, choco- 
late, flour and cigarettes. Two important railway lines traverse 
the state — the Tehuantepec (trans-isthmus) line between the 
ports of Salina Cruz and Coatzacoalcos (Puerto Mexico), and 
the Mexican Southern line (narrow-gauge) from Fuebla to Oaxaca, 
with branches to San Geronimo oh the Tehuantepec line with the 
Guatemalan frontier as its destination, and toward Puerto Angel 
on the coast. Two of the most progressive Indian races of 
Mexico, the Zapotecas and Mixtecas, descendants, it is believed, 
of the prehistoric races who built the remarkable cities where 
the ruins of Mitla and Monte Alban (see Central America: 
§ Antiquities) now stand, still form the greater part of the 
population. 


OAXACA, Oajaca (from Aztec Huaxyacac), or Oaxaca de 
Juarez (official title), capital of the Mexican state of Oaxaca, 
in the central part of the state 288 m. S.E. of the City of Mexico, 
and about 153 m. from Puerto Angel on the Pacific; in lat. 
17 3' N., long. o6° 40' W. Pop. (1900) 35,°49> largely Indians, 
most of whom are Mixtecas and Zapotecas. Oaxaca is con- 
nected with Puebla (211 m.) by the Mexican Southern railway. 
The city lies in a broad, picturesque valley 5085 ft. above sea- 
level, and has a mild temperate climate; annual rainfall about 
$^ in.; mean annual temperature 68° F. It forms the see of a 
bishopric dating from 1535, and has a fine old cathedral (occupy- 
ing the north side of the plaza mayor), built in the Spanish 
Renaissance style and dating from 1553; rebuilt in 1702/ 

According to tradition the Aztec military post and town of 
Huaxyacac was founded in i486. The date of the first Spanish 
settlement is uncertain, but it was probably between 1522 and 
1528. The Oaxaca Valley, including several native towns, had 
been given to Cortes, together with the title marquez del Valle 
de Oaxaca. To injure him, the audiencia then administering 
the government, founded the villa of Antequera in close proximity 
to Huaxyacac and on lands belonging to Cortes in 1529, though 
a settlement had been made at the Indian town at an earlier 
date. Antequera was made a city in 1532 and the see of a 
bishopric in 1535, though it had but few Spanish inhabitants 
and no opportunity to expand. This anomalous state of affairs 
was eventually settled,. Antequera was absorbed by Huaxyacac, 
and the Spanish corrupted the pronunciation to Oaxaca. The 
city suffered severely in the earthquakes of 1727 and 1787, the 
cathedral being greatly damaged in the former. It had a 
chequered career in the War of Independence, being captured 
by Morelos in 181 2, reoccupied by the royalists in 18 14, and 
recaptured by Antonio Leon in 1821. In 1823 it was again 
captured by Nicolas Bravo in the revolution against Iturbide. 
In 1865 it was besieged by the French under Bazaine and sur- 
rendered by General Diaz (4th Feb.) but was recaptured by him 
on the 1st of November 1866, after his escape from Puebla. 
In the revolution promoted by Diaz in 1 871-187 2 the city was 
captured by the Juarist general Alatorre on the 4th of January 
1872, and in a second revolution of 1876 it was captured by the 
friends of Diaz on the 27th of January of that year. 


OB, or Obi, a river of West Siberia, known to the Ostiaks 
as the As, Yag, Kolta and Yema; to the Samoyedes as the 
Kolta or Kuay; and to the Tatars as the Omar or Umar. It 
is formed, 8 m. S.W. of Biysk in the government of Tomsk, 
by the confluence of the Biya and the Katun. Both these 
streams have their origin in the Altai (Sailughem) Mountains, 
the former issuing from Lake Teletskoye, the latter, 400 m. 
long, bursting out of a glacier on Mount Byelukha. The Ob 
zigzags W. and N. until it reaches 55° N.; thence it curves 
round to the N.W., and again N., wheeling finally eastwards 
into the Gulf of Ob, a deep (600 m.) bay of the Arctic Ocean. 
The river splits up into more than one arm, especially after 
receiving the large river Irtysh (from the left) in 69 E. Other 
noteworthy tributaries are: on the right, the Tom, the Chulym, 
the Ket, the Tym and the Vakh; and, on the left, the Vasyugan, 
the Irtysh (with the Ishim and the Tobol) and the Sosva. The 
navigable waters within its basin reach a total length of 9300 m. 
By means of the Tura, an affluent of the Tobol, it secures 
connexion with the J Ekaterinburg-Perm railway at Tyumen, 
and thus is linked on to the rivers Kama and Volga in the heart 
of Russia. Its own length is 2260 m., and the area of its basin 
1,125,200 sq. m. A system of canals, utilizing the Ket river, 
560 m. long in all, connects the Ob with the Yenisei. The Ob 
is ice-bound at Barnaul from early in November to near the end 
of April, and at Obdursk, 100 m. above its mouth, from the end 
of October to the beginning of June. Its middle reaches have 
been navigated by steamboats since 1845. 


OBADIAH, the name prefixed to the fourth of the Old Testa- 
ment " minor prophets," meaning " servant " or " worshipper " 
of Yahweh; of a type common in Semitic proper names; cf. 
the Arabic 'Abdallah, Taimallat, *Abd Manat, &c, the Hebrew 
Abdiel and Obed Edom, and many Phoenician forms. 1 "The 
vision of Obadiah " bears no date, or other historical note, nor 
can we connect Obadiah the prophet with any other Obadiah 
of the Old Testament, 1 and our only clue to the date and com- 
position of the book lies in internal evidence. 

The prophecy is directed against Edom. Yahweh has sent 
a messenger forth among the nations to stir them up to battle 
against the proud inhabitants of Mount Seir, to bring them down 
from the rocky fastnesses which they deem impregnable. Edom 
shall be not only plundered but utterly undone and expelled 
from his borders, and this he shall suffer (through his own folly) 
at the hand of trusted allies (vers. 1-9). The cause of this judg- 
ment is his cruelty to his brother Jacob. In the day of Jerusalem's 
overthrow the Edomites rejoiced over the calamity, grasped 
at a share of the spoil, lay in wait to cut off the fugitives (vers. 
10-14). But now the day of Yahweh is near upon all nations, 
Esau and all the heathen shall drink full retribution for their 
banquet of carnage and plunder on Yahweh's holy mountain. 
A rescued Israel shall dwell in Mount Zion in restored holiness; 
the house of Jacob shall regain their old possessions; Edom 
shall be burned up before them as chaff before the flame; they 
shall spread over all Canaan, over the mountain of Esau and the 
south of Judah, as well as over Gilead and the Philistine and 
Phoenician coast. The victorious Israelites shall come up on 
Mount Zion to rule the mountain of Esau, and the kingdom 
shall be Yahweh's (vers. 15-21). 

The most obvious evidence of date lies in the cause assigned 
for the judgment on Edom (vers. 10-14). The calamity of 
Jerusalem can only be the sack of the city by Nebuchadrezzar 
(586 B.C.); the malevolence and cruelty of Edom on this occasion 
are characterized in similar terms by several writers of the exile 
or subsequent periods, but by none with the same circumstance 
and vividness of detail as here (Ezek. xxv. 8, 12 f., xxxy.; 
Lam. iv. 21; Psalm exxxvii. 7). The prominence given to 
Edom, and the fact that Chaldea is not mentioned at all, make 
it probable that the passage was not written in Babylonia. 
On this evidence, taken alone, we should be justified in saying 
that the prophecy was written at some time after 586 B.C., 
at a period when misfortunes incurred by Edom were interpreted 
as a Divine judgment on its unforgotten treachery in that year 
of tragedy. 

The critical problem is, however, complicated by certain 
phenomena of literary relationship. 8 Obad. 1-6, 8 agree so closely 
and in part verbally with Jer. xlix. 14-16, 9, 10, 7 that the two 
passages cannot be independent; nor does it seem possible 
that Obadiah quotes from Jeremiah, for Obad. 1-8 is a well- 
connected whole, while the parallel verses in Jeiemiah appear 
in different order, interspersed with other matter, and in a much 
less lucid connexion. In Jeremiah the picture is vague, and 
Edom's unwisdom (ver. 7) stands without proof. In Obadiah 
the conception is quite definite. Edom is attacked by his own 
allies, and his folly appears in that he exposes himself to such 
treachery. Again, the probability that the passage in Jeremiah 
incorporates disjointed fragments of an older oracle is greatly 
increased by the fact that the prophecy against Moab in the 
preceding chapter uses, in the same way, Isa. xv., xvi., and the 
prophecy of Balaam. Scholars who assign the passage in 
Jeremiah to 604 B.C. (e.g. Driver, L.O.T. chap. vi. § 4), explain 
this relationship by assuming with Ewald (Propheten, i. 489 f.), 
Graf (Jeremia, p. 558 f.), Robertson Smith and others, that 
Jeremiah and our book of Obadiah alike quote from an older 
oracle. Others, however, who do not regard Jer. xlix. as Jere- 
mianic, explain the relationship as one of dependence on Obadiah. 
This explanation, simpler in itself, is not discredited by the 
fact that in some details (cf. Obad. 2 and Jer. xlix. 15) the text 

[1] An early Hebrew tradition recorded by Jerome (Comm. in Ob.) 
identified the prophet with the best-known Obadiah of the historical 
books, the protector of the prophets in the reign of Ahab (1 Kings 
xviii.). 

[2] Between Joel and Obadiah there are points of material and 
verbal agreement so close as to imply that Joel used the earlier book 
(Joel iii. 19 — Ob. 10, 14; Joel iii.3— Ob. 1 1 ; Joel ii. 32,iii. 7 — Ob. 17), 

of the dependent passage may be preferable to that of the original. 
On this latter, and more probable, view (taken by Wellhausen, 
Nowack and Marti) there is no need to separate Obad. 1-7 
from 10-14. The immediate occasion of the prophecy l was 
doubtless the pressure of nomadic Arabs (" the men of thy 
covenant," " the men of thy peace," v. 7) upon Edom, which 
had resulted, by 312 B.C. at latest, in the occupation by Arabs 
of Petra, the chief city of the Edomites (Wellhausen, p. 214). 
But the desolation of Edom has already been accomplished in 
the time of Malachi i. 1-5, a passage belonging to the earlier 
half of the 5th century. We may, therefore, with Wellhausen, 
Nowack and Marti, assign Obadiah 1-14 to the same period. 

The remainder of the book, vers. (15) 16-21, must belong to 
a later date. That the book of Obadiah, short as it is, is a 
complex document might have been suspected from an apparent 
change of view between vers. 1-7 and vers. 15 f. In the former 
verses Esau is destroyed by his allies, and they occupyhis territory, 
but in the latter he perishes with the other heathen in the day 
of universal retribution, he disappears before the victorious 
advance of Israel, and the southern Judaeans occupy his land. 2 
The ideas of this passage belong to the eschatological outlook 
of later centuries, but afford no data for chronology. The 
conceptions of the " rescued ones " (R.V. " those that escape," 
v.' 17), of the sanctity of Zion, of the kingship of Yahweh, are 
the common property of the post-exilic writers. The restoration 
of the old borders of Israel and the conquest of Edom and the 
Philistines are ideas as old as Amos ix., Isa. xi. 14; but such 
passages represent this conquest as a suzerainty of Israel over 
its neighbours, as in the days of David, while in Obadiah, as 
in other later books, the intensified antithesis — religious as weU 
as political — between Judah and the surrounding heathen finds 
its expression in the idea of a consuming judgment on the latter 
— the great " day of Yahweh." The chief interest of the book 
of Obadiah lies in its references to the historical relations between 
Israel and Edom. From the point of view of religion, we may 
notice the emphasis on the doctrine of strict retribution (vers. 
10 f., i$b) which remains applicable to other peoples, even when 
its inadequacy as a complete theory of providence has been slowly 
and painfully discovered in the case of Israel itself.

OBAN, a municipal and police burgh and seaport of Argyll- 
shire, Scotland. Pop. (1901) 5374. It is situated 113 m. N.W. 
of Glasgow by the Caledonian'railway via Stirling and Callander, 
and about the same distance by water via the Crinan Canal. 
The fine bay on which it lies is screened from the Atlantic gales 
by the island of Kerrera (4 J m. long by 2 m. broad), which 
practically converts it into a land-locked harbour. Being also 
sheltered from the north and east by the hills at the foot of which 
it nestles, the town enjoys an exceptionally mild climate for its 
latitude. The public buildings include the Roman Catholic 
pro-cathedral, erected by the 3rd marquis of Bute, the county

	intended to apply w. 1-7 to the future; so Marti, who groups with

	Yahweh. ,, 

	[2] The Judaeans are addressed in v. 16 ("as ye have drunk"), 
	not the Edomites. Verse 20 anticipates that the exiles from northern 
	Israel will occupy Phoenician territory, whilst those from Jerusalem 
	" which are in Sepharad " will occupy the southern districts in the 
	Messianic restoration. " Sepharad " has been connected with various 
	places, e.g. Saparda in south-west Media (G. A. Smith), and Cparda 
	of Darius in the Behistun inscription (Robertson Smith); whilst, 
	according to Winckler (K.A.T.* p. 301), it is the name, from the 
	Persian period onwards, for Asia Minor. Many of the Jews were 
	doubtless sold as slaves by Nebuchadrezzar. Lydia was a great slave- 
	market, and Asia Minor was a chief seat of the Diaspora at an early 
	date (comp. Gutschmidt, Neue Beitrdgc, p. 77), so that " Sepharad r ' 
	in itself doesnot supply ground for Hitzig's argument that Obadiah 
	was written in the Greek period, when we read of many Jews being 
	transplanted to Asia Minor (Jos. Ant. xii. 3). 

buildings and two hospitals. It is the centre of tourist traffic 
for western Argyllshire and the islands. Oban was a small 
village at the date of Johnson's visit during his Hebridean tour; 
in 1786 it became a government fishing station; it was made 
a burgh of barony in 1811 and a parliamentary burgh in 1832. 
With Ayr, Campbeltown, Inveraray and Irvine (the Ayr burghs) 
it unites to send one member to parliament. 

At the north end of the bay stands the ruin of Dunolly Castle, 
the old stronghold of the Macdougalls of Lome, whose modern 
mansion adjoins it. In the grounds is a huge conglomerate rock 
called the Dog Stone (Clach-a-choin), from the legend that Fingal 
used to fasten his favourite dog Bran to it. About 3 m. N.E. 
are the ruins of Dunstaffnage Castle. It was here that the 
" Stone of Destiny," now contained in the base of the coronation 
chair at Westminster Abbey, was kept before its removal to 
Scone. At the south end of the island of Kerrera stand the ruins 
of Gylen Castle, an old fortalice of the Macdougalls. 


OBBLIGATO, or Obligato, in the modern sense, a musical 
term (adopted from the Italian, and strictly meaning obligatory 
or binding) for an instrumental accompaniment to a musical 
composition which, while in one way independent, is included 
by the composer on purpose and in a prescribed form, instead of 
being left to the discretion (ad libitum) of a performer. 
" OBELISK (Gr. ojfoMtr/cos, diminutive of ojfoXos, a spit), a form 
of monumental pillar; and also the term for a bibliographical 
reference-mark in the form of a dagger. The typical Egyptian 
obelisk is an upright monolith of nearly square section, generally 
10 diameters in height, the sides slightly convex, tapering up- 
wards very gradually and evenly, and terminated by a pyramidion 
whose faces are inclined at an angle of 6o°. Obelisks were usually 
raised on pedestals of cubical form resting on one or two steps, 
and were set up in pairs in front of the entrance of temples. 
Small obelisks have been found in tombs of the age of the Old 
Kingdom. The earliest temple obelisk still in position is that of 
Senwosri I. of the Xllth Dynasty at Heh'opolis (68 ft. high). 
A pair of Rameses II. (77 and 75 ft. high respectively) stood at 
Luxor until one of them was taken to Paris in 1831. Single 
ones of Tethmosis I. and Hatshepsut (109 ft. high) still stand 
at Karnak and remains of others exist there and elsewhere in 
Egypt. Colossal granite obelisks were erected by only a few 
kings, Senwosri I. in the Middle Kingdom and Tethmosis I., 
Hatshepsut, Tethmosis III. and Rameses II. of the Empire. 
Smaller obelisks were made in the Saite period. The Romans 
admired them, and the emperors carried off some from their 
original sites and caused others to be made in imitation (e.g. that 
for Antinous at Benevento): twelve are at Rome, one in Con- 
stantinople; two, originally set up by Tethmosis III. at Heh'o- 
polis, were taken by Augustus to adorn the Caesareum at Alex- 
andria: one of these, " Cleopatra's Needle," was removed in 
1877 to London, the other in 1879 to New York. Such obelisks 
were probably more than mere embellishments of the temples. 
The pyramidions were sheathed in bright metal, catching and 
reflecting the sun's rays as if they were thrones of the sunlight. 
They were dedicated to solar deities, and were especially numer- 
ous at Heh'opolis, where there was probably a single one sacred 
to the sun of immemorial antiquity". The principal part of the 
sun-temple at Abusir built by Neuserre of the Vth Dynasty 
appears to have been in the shape of a stumpy obelisk on a vast 
scale, only the base now remains, but hieroglyphic pictures 
indicate this form. The hieroglyph of some other early sun- 
temples shows a disk on the pyramidion fj. The material 

employed for the great obelisks was a pink granite from the 
quarries of Syene, and in these quarries there still remains, 
partially detached, an example 70 to 80 ft. long. The largest 
obelisk known is that in the piazza of St John Lateran at Rome; 
this had been set up by Tethmosis III. at Heliopoh's in the 15th 
century B.C., was brought over from Egypt by Constantine the 
Great and erected in the Circus Maximus, being ultimately 
re-erected in 1552 by Pope Sixtus V. It was 105 ft. 9 in. high, 
including the pyramidion, and its sides measured 9 ft. 10 in. 
and 9 ft. 8 in. respectively. On the base of the magnificent 
obelisk of Hatshepsut at Karnak, 97 ft. 6 in. high, there is an 
inscription stating that it and its fellow were made within the 
short space of seven months. In consequence of the breaking 
away of the lower part of " Cleopatra's Needles " when removed 
to Alexandria and re-erected, the Roman engineers supported 
the angles on bronze crabs, one of which with three reproductions 
now supports the angles of the obelisk on the Thames Embank- 
ment. 

There was another form of obelisk, also tapering, but more 
squat than the usual type, with two of the sides narrow and ter- 
minating in a rounded top. One such of Senwosri I., covered with 1 
sculpture and inscriptions, lies at Ebgig in the Fayum. Stelae, 
inscribed with the names of the kings, occurred in pairs in the 
royal tombs of the 1st Dynasty at Abydos, and pairs of small 
obelisks are said to have been found in private tombs of the 
IVth Dynasty. The origin of the obelisk may be sought in sacred 
upright stones set up in honour of gods and dead, like the 
menhirs, and the Semitic Massebahs and bethels. 

In Abyssinia, at Axum and elsewhere, there is a marvellous 
series of obelisk-like monuments, probably sepulchral. They 
range from rude menhirs a few feet high to elaborately sculptured 
monoliths of 100 ft. The loftiest of those still standing at Axum 
is about 60 ft. high, 8 ft. 7 in. wide, and about 18 in. thick, and 
is terminated by a rounded apex united by a necking to the 
shaft. The back of the obelisk is plain, but the front and sides 
are subdivided into storeys by a series of bands and plates, each 
storey having panels sunk into it which seem to represent 
windows with mullions and transom. These architectural 
decorations are derived from a style of building found by the 
recent German expedition extant in an ancient church; courses 
of stone here alternate in the walls (both inside and out) with 
beams of wood held by circular clamps. In front of the best- 
preserved obelisk is a raised altar with holes sunk in it apparently 
to receive the blood of the sacrifice to the ancestors. Most of 
these must date before the adoption of Christianity as the state 
religion in the 6th century.

OBERAMMERGAU, a village of Bavaria, Germany, district 
of Upper Bavaria, situated amongst the foot-hills of the Alps 
in the valley of the Ammer, 64 m. S.S.W. of Munich. Pop. 
about 1400. The village folk are mainly engaged in making 
toys, and carving crucifixes, rosaries and images of saints. 

The place is famous for their performance of a Passion 
Play every tenth year {e.g. in 1910), to which thousands of 
visitors flock. This dramatic representation of the sufferings 
of Christ is not a survival of a medieval mystery or miracle- 
play, but took its rise from a vow made by the inhabitants 
in 1633, with the hope of staying a plague then raging. 
The original text and arrangements were probably made by the 
monks of Ettal, a monastery a little higher up the valley; but 
they were carefully remodelled by the parish priest at the 
beginning of the present century, when the Oberammergau play 
obtained exemption from the general suppression of such per- 
formances by the Bavarian government. The music was com- 
posed by Rochus Dedler, schoolmaster of the parish in 1814. 
The performances take place on the Sundays of summer, in a 
large open-air theatre holding 6000 persons, and each lasts about 
nine hours, with a short intermission at noon. Each scene from 
the history of Christ is prefaced by a tableau of typical import 
from the Old Testament. About 700 actors are required, all 
belonging to the village. The proceeds of the performances are 
devoted to the good of the community, after defrayal of the costs 
and payment of a small remuneration to the actors. The villagers 
regard the Passion Play as a solemn act of religious worship, 
and the performances are characterized by the greatest reverence. 
The principal parts are usually hereditary in certain families, 
and are assigned with regard to moral character as well as dra- 
matic ability. It is considered a disgrace not to be allowed 
to take part in the play, and the part of Christ is looked upon as 
one of the greatest of earthly honours. 

Edward Devrient (in 1850) was among the first to direct general 
attention to Oberammergau; and numerous accounts have since 
appeared. An English version of the text of the Passion Play has 
been published by E. Childe (1880). 


OBERHAUSEN, a town of Germany, in the Prussian Rhine 
province. It is situated 5 m. from the east bank of, the Rhine, 
20 m. N.E. of Diisseldorf, on the main fine of railway to Hanover 
and Berlin, and at the centre of an important network of lines 
radiating hence into the extensive Westphalian coal and iron 
fields. Pop. (1905) 52,096. The town possesses large iron- 
works, coal-mines, rolling-mills, zinc smelting-works, railway 
workshops and manufactures of wire-rope, glass," chemicals, 
porcelain and soap. The first houses of Oberhausen were built 
in 1845, and it received its municipal character in 1874. 


OBERLAHNSTEIN, a town of Germany, in the Prussian 
province of Hesse-Nassau, on the right bank of the Rhine, at 
the confluence of the Lahn 4 m. above Coblenz, on the railway 
from Cologne to Frankfort-on-Main. Pop. (1905) 8472. It 
still retains parts of its ancient walls and towers, and possesses 
a castle, the Schloss Martinsburg, formerly the residence of the 
electors of Mainz, and the chapel, Marien Kapelle, in which the 
German king Wenceslaus was deposed by the electors in 1400. 
Near the town is the castle of Lahneck , built about 1 290, destroyed 
by the French in 1689, and restored in 1854. In the neigh- 
bourhood are lead and silver mines.

OBERLANDER, ADAM ADOLF (1845- ), German cari- 
caturist, was born at Ratisbon, but after 1847 lived in Munich. 
He studied painting at the Munich Academy under Piloty. and 
soon discovered that the true expression of his genius was in the 
field of caricature and comic drawings. He joined the staff of 
the Fliegende Blatter, to which he became a constant contributor. 
Unlike Busch, whose aim was the utmost simplicity of line and 
whose drawings form a running commentary to the legend, 
Oberlander's work is essentially pictorial, and expressive in 
itself, without the extraneous aid of the written line. Among 
his best drawings are his parodies on the style of well-known 
painters, such as the " Variations on the Kissing Theme." His 
works have been collected in the OberlUnder- Album, published by 
Braun and Schneider in Munich. 


OBERLIN, JEAN FR^D^RIC (1740-1826), German Protestant 
pastor and philanthropist, the son of a teacher, was born on the 
31st of August 1740 at Strasshurg, where he studied theology. 
In 1766 he became Protestant pastor of Waldbach, a remote 
and barren region in the Steinthal (Ban-de-la-Roche), a valley 
in the Vosges on the borders of Alsace and Lorraine. He set 
himself to better the material equally with the spiritual con- 
dition of the inhabitants. He began by constructing roads 
through the valley and erecting bridges, inciting the peasantry 
to the enterprise by his personal example. He introduced an 
improved system of agriculture. Substantial cottages were 
erected, and various industrial arts were introduced. He 
founded an itinerant library, originated infant schools, and 
established an ordinary school at each of the five villages in the 
parish. In the work of education he received great assistance 
from his housekeeper, Louisa Scheppler (1 763-1 837). He died on 
the 1 st of June 1826, and was interred with great manifestations 
of honour and affection at the village of Urbach.

OBERLIN, J*SR£mIE JACQUES (1735-1806), Alsatian philo- 
logist and archaeologist, brother of Jean Frederic Oberlin, was 
born at Strassbnrg on the 8th of August 1735. While studying 
theology at the university he devoted special attention to 
Biblical archaeology. In 1755 he was chosen professor at the 
gymnasium of his native town, in 1763 librarian to the university, 
in 1 770 professor of rhetoric, and in 1782 of logic and metaphysics. 
Oberlin published several manuals on archaeology and ancient 
geography, and made frequent excursions into different provinces 
of France to investigate antiquarian remains and study provincial 
dialects, the result appearing in Essai sur le patois Lorrain 
(1775); Dissertations sur les Minnesingers (1782-1789); and 
Observations concernant le patois et les mceurs des gens de la 
campagne (1791). He also published several editions of Latin 
authors. He died on the roth of October 1806. 

OBERLIN, a village of Lorain county, Ohio, U.S.A., 34 m. 
W.S.W. of Cleveland. Pop. (1S90) 4376; (1900) 4082 (641 ne- 
groes); (1910) 4365. It is served by the Lake Shore & Michigan 
Southern railway, and by the Cleveland & South-Western 
(electric) railway, which furnishes connexions directly with 
Cleveland and Elyria, and at the village of Wellington (about 
10 m. S.) connects with the Cleveland, Cincinnati, Chicago & 
St Louis, and the Wheeling & Lake Erie railways. Oberlin is 
primarily an educational centre, the seat of Oberlin College, 
named in honour of Jean Fr6deric Oberlin, and open to both 
sexes; it embraces a college of arts and sciences, an academy, 
a Theological Seminary (Congregational), which has a Slavic 
department for the training of clergy for Slavic immigrants, and 
a conservatory of music. In 1909 it had twenty buildings, and 
a Memorial Arch of Indiana buff limestone, dedicated in 1903, 
in honour of Congregational missionaries, many of them Oberlin 
graduates, killed in China in 1900. Its libraries contained in 
190c) 98,000 bound volumes and an equal number of pamphlets, 
and the college had a faculty numbering 113 and a student 
enrolment of 1944. The resources of the college in 1909 were 
about $3,500,000. Under the editorship of a professor emeritus 
is published the Bibliotheca Sacra, a quarterly founded in 1843, 
and for many years the organ of the Andover Theological 
Seminary. 

The village was founded' as Oberlin Colony in 1833 (in 1846 
it was incorporated as the village of Oberlin), by the Rev. John J. 
Shipherd (1 802-1 844), pastor of a church in Elyria, and the 
Rev. Philo Penfield Stewart (1 798-1 868), a missionary to the 
Choctaws of Mississippi, as a home for Oberlin Collegiate In- 
stitute, which was chartered in 1834; the name Oberlin College 
was adopted in 1850. To the Theological Seminary, opened in 
183 s, there came in the same year forty students from Lane 
Theological Seminary in Cincinnati, after the discussion of slavery 
there had been forbidden by its board of trustees. A former 
member of the board, Asa Mahan (1800-1889), who had strongly 
disapproved of the action of the trustees, came to Oberlin, and 
became the first president of the college. Oberlin was the first 
American college to adopt coeducation of sexes, and was a 
pioneer in America (1835) in the coeducation of the white and 
black races. 1 The village became a station on the Underground 
Railway, and an important centre of anti-slavery sentiment. 
Manual labour was adopted at first as a means for students to 
defray their college expenses. As late as 1906 it was estimated 
that nearly two-thirds of the men were to a greater or less degree 
self-supporting, as were many of the young women. What is 
known as the " Oberlin Theology " (no longer identified with the 
college) centred in the teaching of Charles Grandison Finney 
(1792-1875), who became professor of theology in 1835 and was 
Mahan's successor in the presidency (1851-1866). He was a 
powerful preacher and teacher, who broke from Calvinism in 
denying imputation and teaching perfect freedom of the will, 
by which perfect holiness might be attained. Finney carried

	1858 by a United States marshal, but was rescued at Wellington.

	Oberlin College, were arrested and were imprisoned in Cleveland 
	for several months. This was a famous fugitive slave case.

James Harris Fairchild (181 7-1902) was president from 1866 
to 1889; William Gay Ballantine (b. 1848), a distinguished 
Hebrew scholar, was president in 1891-1896, and John Henry 
Barrows (1847-1902) from 1899 to 1902, when he was succeeded 
by Henry Churchill King (b. 1858). 

The modern theological position of Oberlin college is reflected in 
the writings of President King and of Dean Edward I. Bosworth 
(b. 1861) of the Theological Seminary, especially in President King's 
Reconstruction in Theology (1901) ; Theology and the Social Conscious- 
ness (1902); The Seeming Unreality of the Spiritual Life (1908) and 
The Laws of Friendship — Human and Divine (1909).

OBERON (Fr. Alberon, Auberon, Ger. Alberich, i.e. rick, 
Goth.' reiks, " ruler "— cf. Lat. rex— and O.H. and M.H. Ger. 
pi. elbi % elbe, " elves," pi. alp), king of the elves. In the legendary 
history 2 of the Merovingian dynasty he figures as a magician, 
and is the brother of Merowech (Merovee). He wins for his 
eldest son Walbert the hand of a princess of Constantinople. 
In the Nibelungenlied he guarded the treasure of the Nibelungen, 
but was overcome by Sigfrid. In the German medieval poem 
of Orlnit, the hero is aided in his wooing by his father Alberich, 
the king of the dwarfs. As Oberon, king of the fairies, he fills 
a similar i61e in Huon of Bordeaux (q. v.). The fairy element in 
the romance provided Shakespeare with the fairy scenes of the 
Midsummer NigkVs Dream, and Wieland with the subject of 
his epic Oberon (1780). Ben Jonson wrote a masque of Oberon, 
or the Fairy Prince (Works, 161 6). Weber's opera, Ober on, 
to the words of J. R. Planche, was first produced at Covent 
Garden on the 12th of April 1826. In the Wagner dramas 
Alberich is the Nibelung who steals the magic gold from the 
Rhine maidens. He is there the father of Hagen, and has 
throughout the Ring a darker character than that assigned to 
him in the original legend. There have been attempts to find 
the original Oberon in the Celtic Gwyn Aron, but there is no 
doubt of his Germanic origin, although his history, as given 
by the poet of Huon of Bordeaux, contains elements derived 
from Celtic tradition — the magic cup which remains full for 
the virtuous, and his parentage (he is the son of Morgan la fay 
and Julius Caesar). With Oberon in the character of guardian 
of the treasure should be compared Andvari, the dwarf of 
Scandinavian legend, who, in the shape of a pike, was seized by 
Loki and made to give up his treasure and the magic ring by 
which he could create more gold. This ring, the Andvaranautr, 
with the curse of Andvari upon it, caused the misfortunes of 
the Volsungs and the Burgundian Nibelungs, and is known in 
German romance as the Ring of the Nibelungen.

OBERSTEIN, a town of Germany, in the principality of 
Birkenfeld, belonging to the grand duchy of Oldenburg, on the 
river Nahe, 33m. S.W. of Kreuznach, by the railway to Miinster- 
am-Stein. Pop. (1905) 9669. It is famous for the cutting and 
setting of agates and other precious stones, an industry which 
has been established here, and in the neighbouring township 
of Idar, since the 16th century. The Evangelical church, built 
in the 12th century and restored in 1482, is partly hewn out 
of the solid rock. On the hills above the town are the ruins of 
two castles.

OBIT (through 0. Fr., from Lat. obitus, death, obire, to go 
down, to die), a term for death, formerly used for the account 

	[8] The last history of Hugo of Toul (12th century) was the authority 
	of Jacques de Guyse (14th century) in his Annates historiae ill 
	princip. Hannoniae (Mon. Germ. xxx.) ( where there is an account 
	(bk. ix. ch. 6 ) of Alberich. 

of a person's death (now " obituary ")- An " obit " was ^ so 
a service performed at a funeral or in commemoration of a dead 
person, particularly the founder or benefactor of a church, 
college or other institution, hence "obit-days," "obit Sunday," 
&c. A "post-obit" is a bond given as a security for the repay- 
ment of money lent upon the death of a person from whom the 
borrower has expectations (see Bond). 


OBITER DICTUM, that which is said by the way or in passing 
(Lat. ob, by, and iter, road); specifically, in law, an opinion 
expressed by a judge incidentally in the course of a case, on a 
point of law not necessarily connected with the issue or not 
forming part of the grounds of the decision; such obiter dicta 
have no binding authority. 


OBJECT and SUBJECT, in philosophy, the terms used to 
denote respectively the external world and consciousness. The 
term " object " (from Lat. ob, over against, and jacere, to throw) 
is* used generally in philosophy for that in which an activity of 
the mind ends, or towards which it is directed. With these 
may be compared the ordinary uses of the term for " thing " 
simply, or for that after which one strives, or at which one-aims. 
"Subject," literally that which is "thrown under" (sub), is 
originally the material or content of a discussion or thought, 
but in philosophy is used for the thought or the thinking person. 
The relation between the thinking subject and the object thought 
is analogous to the grammatical antithesis of the same terms: 
the " subject " of a verb is the person or thing from which the 
action proceeds, while the " object," direct or indirect, is the 
person or thing affected. The true relation between mind or 
thought (subject) and matter or extension (object) is the chief 
problem of philosophy, and may be investigated from various 
standpoints (see Psychology and Metaphysics). It should 
be observed that the philosophical use of " subject " is precisely 
the opposite of the common use. In ordinary language the 
" subject " of discussion, of a poem, of a work of art, is that 
which the speaker, author or artist treats. 


OBJECTIVE, or Object Glass, the lens of any optical system 
which first receives the light from the object viewed; in a 
compound system the rays subsequently traverse the eye-piece. 
The theoretical investigations upon which the construction of 
an optical system having specified properties is based, are treated 
in the article Aberration, and, from another standpoint, in 
the article Diffraction. Here we deal with the methods by 
which the theoretical deductions are employed by the practical 
optician. It should be noted that the mathematical calcula- 
tions provide data which are really only approximations, and 
consequently it is often found that a system constructed on such 
data requires modification before it fulfils the practical require- 
ments. For example, take the case of a photographic objective. 
Calculations of the paths of two extreme rays in the meridional 
section of an oblique pencil of large aperture may prove that the 
rays intersect on a plane containing the axial focus, but similar 
calculations of many other rays would be necessary before the 
mean point of intersection could be settled with sufficient 
exactness. Suppose, however, that the optician has accurately 
realized the results of the mathematician, he can then determine 
the divergence of the practical from the theoretical properties 
by measuring the positions and conformation of the most distinct 
or mean foci, and, if sufficiently acquainted with the theory of 
the construction, he can modify one or more curvatures or thick- 
nesses and so attain to a closer agreement with the ideal. Theory 
and practice co-operate in the realization of an original system. 
The order is not always the same, but generally the mathe- 
matician, by notoriously laborious calculations, supplies data 
which are at first closely followed by the constructor and after- 
wards modified in accordance with experimental observations. 

In addition to the problem of constructing an original system, 
the optician has to deal with the reproduction of a realized system 
in different sizes. Two questions then arise: (i) To what 
degree of accuracy the radii of curvature can, or should, be re- 
peated, and (2) to what degree of uniformity the surfaces can, 
or should be figured. With regard to the first point there is 
no great difficulty in working the requisite iron or brass tools 
of any curvature to within an error of i^th% of the radius; 
male and female templets being used for very deep curves, and 
the spherometer for tools of longer radii (by appropriate grinding 
together, the radii are alterable at will within narrow, but 
sufficient, b'mits). The accuracy attained in the grinding, 
however, is open to very perceptible modification by the sub- 
sequent polishing and figuring processes. This is particularly 
undesirable in the case of deep curves and large apertures. A 
variation in a radius of curvature may occasion a little spherical 
aberration at the axial focus, but if the amount be small it 
may be neutralized by imparting to the lens a parabolic form 
or its opposite. Such an artifice is frequently adopted in 
correcting large telescope objectives. 

With optical systems which transmit large pencils with con- 
siderable obliquity (such as wide angle photographic objectives) 
the curves are very deep, and a departure from the true radius 
which would be tolerated in a telescope cannot be permitted 
here. Such lenses are usually tested by means of a master curve 
worked in glass. The master curve is fitted to the experimental 
lens, and an inspection of the interference fringes shows the 
quality of the fit — whether it be perfect, or too shallow or too 
deep. The workman then modifies his polisher or stroke in order 
to correct the divergence. Flat surfaces are tested similarly. 
This test by contact has been strongly advocated and has been 
regarded as sufficient to detect all irregularities of any moment. 
This claim, however, is not justified, for the test is not sensitive 
to errors sufficient in amount to render a telescope objective 
almost valueless; but such errors are easily discernible by 
other optical devices. In general, accuracy in the radii of 
curvature is of primary importance and trueness of figuring 
is of secondary importance in photographic objectives, while 
the reverse holds with telescopic objectives; in wide angle 
microscopic objectives these two conditions are of equal moment. 
Eye pieces do not require the same degree of accuracy either 
in the curvature or the figuring. 

A rough idea of the exactitude to which the figuring of the finest 
telescope objectives must be carried out is readily deduced. If two 
slips of paper, bearing printed letters ^ of an in. high be placed 
in almost exact alignment, one 31-2 in. from the eye and the other 
39 in., and viewed in moderate day light # with the eye having a pupil- 
lary aperture of J of an in., one set of the letters will be legible 
while the other is not. In this case the difference of convergence or 
refracting power exercised by the eye in transferring its focus from 
one slip to the other is if 3 or one quarter diopter. If an image on the 
retina, is } diopter out of focus, then each point of the object is repre- 
sented by a circle of confusion 0-0004 in. or 2' 45* in angular measure 
in diameter, the focal length of the eye being assumed to be 0*5 in. 
and the pupillary aperture J of an in. If the effective aperture 
of the pupil or the aperture of a pencil traversing the pupil be i/wth 
of this standard, the size of the disk of confusion will be the same 
(viz. 0-0004 m if the retinal image be n quarter diopters out of focus. 
In general, for a constant size of the circle of confusion or, in other 
words, the same amount of visual blurring, the apertures of the 
pencils traversing the pupil and the focussing errors (expressed in 
quarter diopters) vary inversely. 

If a portion of a figured surface of a telescope objective differs 
in curvature from the major portion of the lens so as to form a circle 
of confusion on the retina of a diameter not less than 2' 45*, it is 
clear that the lens is faulty, the image formed by the perfect portion 
being sharp and well denned, and that formed by the imperfect 
portion blurred to the extent above determined, and to a greater 
extent if we allow for the effect of diffraction in the formation of the 
image. For example, a protuberance 1 in. in diameter at the centre 
of an object glass of 12 in. aperture refracting to a separate focus 
would theoretically form a spurious disk of about 5 seconds diameter, 
which would subtend a diameter of 50 minutes at the retina under a 
power of 600. 

Regarding 2' 45* as the maximum diameter of a geometric circle of 
confusion permissible in a telescopic object glass.^ we proceed to 
determine the heights of the protuberance or depression which causes 
it. If / be the equivalent focal length of the eye-piece and F that of 
the objective (the back focal length in the case of the microscope), 
then the linear error at the focus oft he eye- piece is -j l^p, or, expressed 
as a variation of i/F, T h(//F) 1 , (=Ap). If a lens has one side 
plane and is worked to a mathematically sharp edge, its thickness t 
at the centre is (approximately) A s /8fi where A is the whole aperture 
and r the radius; and if g be the equivalent focal length and n the 
refractive index, we may write r=g{ji — 1) and obtain 

	*-AV8*(m-i) .... (1). 

It is clear that for lenses in which the focal length is large compared 
with the aperture, the thickness / is independent of the shape of the 
lens so long as the focal length and aperture remain constant. 
Consequently a protuberance may be regarded as a thin meniscus 
lens with mathematically sharp edges accurately fitted to a perfectly 
regular spherical surface. Substituting for i/g the T £ ? (//F)* obtained 
above it follows that

	• a 1 / = 8(/x O156 (f) (2). 

The effective aperture of the eye has been supposed to be i in. ; 
calling this P, it is then obvious that (since F/J[ is the magnifying 
power) P(F/f) is the theoretical aperture of objective requisite to 
supply the $ in. eye-pencil. Substituting P(F//J for A in equation 
(2) we obtain 

	/ = P78(p-i)Xi56 .... (3). 

This relation gives the thickness of a meniscus protuberance fitted 
to an objective (assumed to have an unlimited aperture) which^ fills 
the J in. pupil and occasions the maximum blurring permissible. 
If p be 1 -Si.* is equal to 1/39,936 in. 

If the thickness t correspond to the aperture A, then for another 
aperture a to produce the same blurring we must have A' (i/F) — 
A(i/F)A/a, i.e. the focal length of the protuberance, and therefore 
the thickness t must vary as A. Consider a telescope of 12 in. 
aperture, focal length of objective (F) = 180 in., focal length of eye- 
piece (£) 0-3 in. and magnifying power (F//)=6oo. The aperture 
theoretically requisite to transmit the pupillary pencil of \ in. 
aperture is i*6oo = 75 in. If the permissible protuberance cover the 
entire aperture of 75 in. its thickness would be 1/39,936 in. as above, 
but if restricted to a diameter of 1 in., then the maximum allowable 
thickness would be 1/75X1/39,936 in. = say 1/3,000,000 in. Since 
the latter protuberance is assumed to fill only Jt of the aperture 
of the pupil of the eye, it produces an error in focussing equivalent 
to 75 quarter diopters or ^A. If we take the power of the eye- 
piece to be I/-3 in. and subtract from it 75/150, we obtain 1 />35, 
so that AF is - -05 in. 

Either the knife-edge test, or the more usual method of testing 
figuring by examining the^ out-of-focus disks formed on the retina 
when the eye-piece is inside and outside its correct focus, would 
certainly show a the effect of this protuberance as a bright central 
spot when inside focus, and a dark central patch when outside; 
a practised eye can detect one-half the above error, and a quarter 
when the power is 1200 instead of 600. It may be noticed that, 
under the same circumstances, the error permissible in a reflecting 
telescope is only one quarter of that admitted in the refractor. In 
the case of a microscope objective of 10 in. back-focal-length used 
witha 1 in. eye-piece, the aperture required to transmit the pupillary 
pencil of i in. aperture is 1} in. Regarding the supposititious 
protuberance or depression as -gV in. in diameter, its thick- 
ness or depth must not exceed 1/39 ,936X0-05/1 -25, or say 1/1,000,000 
in. Therefore the accuracy of figuring required in the best micro- 
scopes does notfall far short of that required in telescopes. 

The best optical workmanship, as applied to large reflecting sur- 
faces, aims at reducing local protuberances or depressions to within 
the limiting height or depth of one twelve-millionth part of their 
diameter (A) and the optical methods which detect these errors are 
exceedingly delicate. The finest spherometer detects errors down 
to about three-millionths of an inch, below which it is valueless. The 
same applies to the study of the interference fringes formed when a 
master curve is fitted. It will not show up such fine errors. The 
figuring of spherical surfaces 12 in. or more in diameter by abrasion 
with a polisher so that no part of the surface is elevated or depressed 
above the average level by more than the above defined amounts is 
Commonly practised, but much technical knowledge is necessary for 
success. It is a sine qua non that the material of the polisher should 
be as plastic and inelastic as is consistent with a moderate degree of 
hardness. The best material for large work is Stockholm pitch from 
which the greater part of the turpentine has been removed by 
evaporation, and the abrasive used is the finest rouge and water. 
For small work certain waxes, more or less mixed with rouge or putty 
powder, are used. Water is used as the lubricant. During delicate 
figuring temperature changes must^ be carefully avoided, otherwise 
buckling and consequent bad figuring of the lens or a variation in 
the^ hardness of the polisher may supervene. The motion of the 
polisher must therefore be leisurely. Moreover, any surface must be 
allowed to attain a uniform temperature before testing. When, 
as often happens, an elevation or depression on a large lens appar- 
ently refuses to be dislodged by straightforward polishing, recourse 
is had to local retouching. The faulty parts are localized by optical 
tests and then rubbed down by small polishers of an inch or more 
in diameter. In this way a central protuberance 1 in. in diameter 
-and 1/2,000,000 of an in. high standing on the centre of a large 
objective may be removed by a polisher less than an inch in diameter 
worked at 200 half inch strokes per minute and at a pressure of 6 qzs. 
in about a minute. Great care is required, for if the process be carried 
too far, the whole surface must be re-figured. Local retouching 
serves to remove those conspicuous zones of aberration to which 
certain photographic lenses of large relative aperture are necessarily 
liable. An annular channel is polished out at a mean distance egual 
to ^ of the semi-aperture from the centre of the lens, and this is 
carefully shaded off towards the centre and also towards the edge; 
this corrects the zone of rays which focus at a point short of the 
focus of the centre and edge rays. This correction is particularly 
necessary in the case of certain lenses designed for stellar photo- 
graphy. (H. D. T.) 


OBJECTIVISM, in philosophy, a term used, in contradistinc- 
tion to Subjectivism, for any theory of knowledge which to a 
greater or less extent attributes reality (as the source and 
necessary pre-requisite of knowledge) to the external world. 
The distinction is based upon the philosophical antithesis 
of the terms Object and Subject, and their respective 
adjectival forms " objective " and " subjective." In common use 
these terms are opposed as synonymous respectively with " real " 
and " imaginary," " practical " and " theoretical," " physical " 
and " psychic." A man " sees " an apparition; was there any 
physical manifestation, or was it merely a creation of his mind ? 
If the latter the phenomenon is described as purely subjective. 
Subjectivism in its extreme form denies that mind can know 
more than its own states. Objects, i.e. things-in-themselves, 
may or may not exist: the mind knows only its own sensa- 
tions, perceptions, ideal constructions and so forth. In a 
modified form " subjectivism " is that theory which attaches 
special importance to the part played by the mind in the 
accumulation of experience. See Psychology; Relativity 
of Knowledge. 


OBLATION, an offering (Late Lat. oblatio, from ojferre, 
oblatum, to offer), a term, particularly in ecclesiastical usage, 
for a solemn offering or presentation to God. It is thus applied 
to certain parts of the Eucharistic service in the Roman Church. 
There are " two oblations," the " lesser oblation," generally 
known as the " offertory," in which the bread and wine yet 
unconsecrated are presented, and the " greater oblation," the 
" oblation " proper, forming the latter part of the prayer of 
consecration, when the " Body and Blood " are ceremonially 
presented. The word " oblate " is an ecclesiastical term for 
persons who have devoted themselves or have been devoted 
as children by their parents to a monastic life. " Oblate " is 
more familiar in the Roman Church as the name of a religious 
congregation of secular priests, the Oblate Fathers of St Charles. 
They are placed under the absolute authority of the bishop of 
the diocese in which they are established and can be employed 
by him on any duties he may think fit. This congregation was 
founded in 1578 under the name of Oblates of the Blessed Virgin 
and St Ambrose by St Charles Borromeo, archbishop of Milan 
(see Borromeo, Carlo). There is a similar congregation of 
secular priests, the Oblates of Mary the Immaculate, founded 
at Marseilles in 1815. " 


OBLIGATION, in law, a term derived from the Roman law, 
in which obligatio signified a tie of law {vinculum juris) whereby 
one person is bound to perform or forbear some act for another. 
The obligatio of Roman law arose either from voluntary acts 
or from circumstances to which legal consequences were annexed. 
In the former case it was said to arise ex contractu, from contract, 
in the latter quasi ex contractu, ex delicto, or quasi ex delicto — 
that is to say, from tort, or from acts or omissions to which the 
law practically attached the same results as it did to contract 
or tort. Obligatio was used to denote either end of the legal 
chain that bound the parties, the right of the party who could 
compel fulfilment of the obligatio, the creditor, or the duty of 
the party who could be compelled to fulfilment, the debitor. 
In English law obligation has only the latter sense. Creditor 
and debtor have also lost their Roman law signification; they 
have been narrowed to mean the parties where the obligation 
is the payment of a sum of money. In English law obligation 
is used in at least four senses — (i) any duty imposed by law; 
(2) the special duty created by a vinculum juris", (3) not the 
duty, but the evidence of the duty — that is to say, an instrument 
under seal, otherwise called a bond; (4) the operative part of 
a bond. The third use of the word is chiefly confined to the 
older writers. Simplex and duplex obligatio were the old names 
for what are now more commonly called a single and a double 
or conditional bond. The party bound is still called the obligor, 
the party in whose favour the bond is made the obligee. The 

fourth, like the third, is a use scarcely found except in the older 
writers. The word " bond " is of course a mere translation 
of obligatio. Obligations may be either perfect or imperfect. 
A perfect obligation is one which is directly enforceable by 
legal proceedings; an imperfect or moral obligation (the 
naturalis obligatio of Roman law) is one in which the vinculum 
juris is in some respects incomplete, so that it cannot be directly 
enforced, though it is not entirely destitute of legal effect. A 
perfect obligation may become imperfect by lapse of time or 
other means, and, conversely, an imperfect obligation may under 
certain circumstances become perfect. Thus a debt may be 
barred by the Statute of Limitations and so cease to be enforce- 
able. The obligation, however, remains, though imperfect, 
for if there be a subsequent acknowledgment by the debtor, 
the debt revi\es, and the imperfect obligation becomes again 
perfect. At one period there was some doubt among English 
lawyers whether a moral obligation could be regarded as sufficient 
consideration for a contract; it has now, however, been long 
decided that it cannot be so regarded. 

American law is in general agreement with English, except in 
the case of Louisiana, where the terms obligor and obligee are 
used in as wide a sense as the debitor and creditor of Roman law. 
By art. 3522 of the Louisiana civil code obligor or debtor means 
the person who has engaged to perform some obligation, obligee 
or creditor the person Jn favour of whom some obligation is con- 
tracted, whether such obligation be to pay money or to do or 
not to do something. The term obligation is important in 
America from its use in art. i. s. 10 of the constitution of the 
United States, "No state . . . shall pass any . . . law . . . impairing 
the obligation of contracts." This does not affect the power 
of Congress to pass such a law. Contracts between private 
individuals are of course within the provision. So are private 
conveyances, charters of private corporations and statutory 
and other grants by a state. On the other hand, marriage and 
divorce, and arrangements which are political in their nature, 
such as charters of municipal corporations, licences to carry on 
particular trades or regulations of police are not within the 
provision. In order to fall within it, the law must act upon the 
terms of the agreement, and not merely upon the mode of pro- 
cedure. If it act not upon the terms but upon the remedy, it 
impairs the obligation if it purport to be retrospective, but it 
is valid so far as it applies to subsequent contracts. 


OBNOXIOUS (Lat. obnoxiosus, from ob, over, against, and 
noxOy harm), a word originally meaning " exposed to harm or 
injury," but now " exciting aversion or dislike." The current 
use dates from the later 17th century. 


OBOE, or Hautboy (Fr. kautbois, Ger. Hoboe, Ital. oboe), 
the treble member of the class of wood-wind instruments, having 
a conical bore and a double reed mouthpiece. The oboe consists 
of a conical wooden tube, composed of three joints, upper, 
middle and bell, and of a short metal tube to which are bound 
by many turns of waxed silk the two thin pieces of cane that form 
the mouthpiece. These pieces of cane are so bevelled and 
thinned at the end which is taken into the mouth that the 
gentlest stream of compressed air suffices to set them vibrating. 
Practice has demonstrated that the reed stalk of which the 
double reed mouthpiece is made, should not be of narrower 
internal diameter than the pipe containing the column of air 
upon which it is destined to act. The player breathes gently 
into the aperture, which has the form of a very narrow ellipse, 
managing his breath as for singing. The vibrations of the double 
reed produce in the stream of compressed air issuing from the 
player's lips the rhythmical series of pulses necessary to generate 
sound waves in the stationary column of air within the main tube 
of the instrument. 

In the upper and middle joints are the rings and keys covering 
lateral holes bored through the tube, by means of which the 
column of air, and consequently the wave length, may be shortened 
at will; the bell joint contains one or two keys normally open, 
which when closed extend the lowest register by lengthening 
the air column. These holes and keys produce the fundamental 
scale of the oboe, which possesses notes sufficient for an octave 
with all chromatic intervals. The next octaves are obtained 
by means of cross fingering (Fr. doigti fourcku, Ger. Gabelgrijf), 
and of the octave keys, which do not give out an independent 
note of their own, but determine a node in the column of air, 
whereby the latter divides and vibrates in two half sections 
producing the second harmonic overtone or octave. In order 
to obtain this result the player inci eases the pressure of his 
breath and also the tension of his lips against the reed. 

The compass of the oboe is from 
: with all 
chromatic semitones. The G clef is used in notation and all 
notes are sounded as written. 

The quality of tone or timbre depends primarily on the con- 
figuration of the sound waves (see Horn), which is influenced 
by the special characteristics of the mouth- 
pieced the musical tone of an instrument 
may be said to be due more directly to the 
prevalence and relative strength of the 
many harmonics which go to make up a 
composite tone or clang. The quality of the 
oboe tone resembles that of the E string of 
the violin, but is more nasal, more penetrat- 
ing and shriller. The lower register is thin 
and somewhat sweeter, approximating to the 
upper register of the cor anglais. But the 
timbre does not vary appreciably in the 
different registers, and to this want of variety 
in tone colour is due the unpopularity of the 
oboe as a solo instrument, although it is 
invaluable as a melody-leading instrument in 
the orchestra, balanced by clarinets and flutes. 
The oboe lends itself admirably to pastoral 
music. The technical capabilities of the in- 
strument are very varied. It is possible to 
play on it diatonic and chromatic scale and 
arpeggio passages, legato and staccato; leaps; 
cantabile passages; sustained notes, cres- 
cendo and diminuendo, grace notes and shakes 
(with reservations). The keys having many 
sharps and flats are the most difficult for the 
oboist. 

The double reed is the most simple, as it is 
probably the oldest, of all reed contrivances. It 
is sufficient to flatten the end of a wheat straw 
to constitute an apparatus capable of setting in 
vibration by the breath the column of air con- 
tained in the rudimentary tube; the invention 
of this reed is certainly due to chance. An 
apparatus for sonorous disturbance thus found, 
it was easy to improve it : for the wheat stalk 
a reed stalk was substituted, and in the extremity 
of its pipe another reed stalk much shorter in 
length was inserted, pared and flattened at the 
end; and then came the lateral holes, probably 
another discovery of the great inventor chance. 
For the reed tube a wooden one was substituted, 
still preserving the reed tongue, and it is in 
this form, after having played an important 
part^ amongst the sonorous contrivances of an- 
tiquity, that we find the ancestor of the oboe 
playing apart no less important in the 16th 
century, in which it formed the interesting 
families of the cromorncs, the corthols and the 
cervelas. ^ All these families have disappeared 
from the instrumental combinations of Europe, 
but they are still to be found in Eastern wind instruments, such 
as the Caucasian salamouri y the Chinese kwantze, and the hitshiriki of 
Japan. 

It is impossible to say when it was that man first employed the 
phenomena of double reeds and conical pipes, but the knowledge of 
them must at least have been later than that of the cylindrical 
pipe, which we may regard as directly furnished by nature. That 
antiquity made use of them, however, has been proved by Gevaert 
in his admirable Histoire de la musique dans rantiquitS; but this 
learned author states that the double-reed pipes held but an in- 
significant place in the instrumental music of ancient Greece and 
Rome, a statement which is open to challenge (see Aulos).

Fig. 1.— The Oboe. 

The first appearance of the instrument we call oboe in a musical 
work occurs in Sebastian Virdung's Musica getutscht und aussgezogen 
(151 1). It there bears the name of Schalmey, and is already 
associated with an instrument cf similar construction called Bom- 
bardt. 

There exists, however, much earlier evidence, in the illuminated 
MSS. and in the romances of the middle ages, of the great popularity 
of the instrument in all parts of Europe. The origin of wind instru- 
ments with conical tubes must be sought in the East, in Asia. An 
early medieval Schalmey with three holes may be seen on the silver 
cup of the goddess Nana-Anat. 1 

There are two or three Schalmeys in the fine 13th-century Spanish 
MS. Cantigas de Santa Maria executed for Alphonso the Wise, pre- 
served in the Library of the Escorial s (J. b 2). 

The oboe was known during the early middle ages as Calamus, 
Chalumeau (France), Schalmei (Germany), Shawm (England). It is 
mentioned in the Roman de Brut (12th century) (line 10,822 sea,.) 
" Lyres, tympres, et chalemiax." An interesting MS. at the British 
Museum, Sloane 3983, contains ameng other musical instruments 
on fol. 13 a large shawm with 6 finger-holes described at the side as 
Calamus aureus. 

A miniature in the Paris Manesse MS.* of the 14th century depicts 
Heinrich von Meissen, better known as Frauenlob, conducting, from 
a raised platform, a band of musicians, one of whom is holding a 
Schalmey with 6 or 7 holes. 

The chaunter of the bagpipe was a shawm, having the double reed 
concealed within an air-chamber, while the drones had single beating 
reeds concealed in the same manner. Mersenne calls both chalu- 
tneaux.* The cornemuse or chalemie of shepherds and peasants was 
of this kind, but a special cornemuse, used in the 17th century in 
concert with the hautbois de Poitou, had double reeds throughout 
in chaunter and drone. The hautbois de Poitou was a primitive 
oboe with the reed placed in a bulb, forming an air-chamber, having 
a raised slit at the top through which the performer breathed in 
compressed air; as the reed could not be controlled by the lips, it 
was impossible to play with expression on the hautbois de Poitou or 
to obtain the harmonic octaves; the compass was therefore limited. 
The kind of bagpipe (q.v.) known as Musette, 6 inflated by bellows, 
also had double reeds throughout in spite of having a cylindrical 
chaunter. 

The manufacture of musical instruments could not remain un- 
affected by the great artistic movement known as the Renaissance; 
accordingly, we find them not only improved and purified in form 
in the 16th century, but also ranged in complete families from the 
soprano to the bass. Praetorius, in his Syntagma Musicum (1615- 
1620), gives us the full nomenclature of the family with which we 
are concerned, composed of the following individuals: (1) The little 
Schalmey, rarely employed, measured about 17 in. in length, and had 
six lateral holes. Its deepest note was fc =*zq . (2) The discant 
:SchaImey (fig. 2)," the primitive type of the modern oboe; its length 
was about 26 in., and its deepest note fe J | . (3) The 
alto Pommer (fig. 3), 30$ in. long, with its deepest notefeEE 

1(4) The tenor Pommer (fig. 4), measuring about 4 ft. 4 in.; besides 
:the six lateral holes of the preceding numbers there were four keys 
which produced the notes 

«■ ' J l~ * (5) The bass Pommer, 
having a length of nearly 6 ft. ; it had six lateral holes and four keys 
which produced 

(6) The great double quint 
Pommer, measuring about 9 ft. 8 in. in length; its four keys 
m 1 
permitted the production of the notes J _j 1 N . These in- 
struments, and especially numbers (2), (3), (4) and (5), occupied an 
important place on the continent of Europe in the instrumental 
♦combinations of the 1 6th- 1 8th centuries. Fig. 5, borrowed from a

The 17th century brought no great changes in
the construction of the four smaller instruments of the 
family. Michel de la Barre writing in 1740 states that in 
the archives of the Chambre des Comptes are 4 charges 
for hautbois and musettes de Poitou created by King 
John 8 (14th century). Extensively used in France, they 
were there called haulx bois " or " hault- 
bois," to distinguish them from the two larger 
instruments which were designated by the 
words " gros bois." Haultbois became haut- 
bois in French, and oboe in English, German 
and Italian; and this word is now used to 
distinguish the smallest instrument of the family. 

During the 17th century some of the most important 
names connected with instrumental music in France are 
to be found amongst the Grands Hautbois of the Grande 
£curie du Roi, such as Hotteterre (Jean, Louis and 
Nicholas), Philidor (Jacques and Andre*), Gilles Allain, 
Destouches, &c. [9] 

In Germany the Schalmey was represented in the town band, in
the Court and the Church orchestras, and later in that of the
Opera. In 1580 it is recorded that the Orchestra of the elector
of Brandenburg[10] induded Schalmeysand Bombarts. In Dresden
the orchestra possessed (1593) no less than 16 Schalmeys, large
and small. Heinrich Schiitz, who founded the first Opera in
Germany, at Dresden, used two fiffari or early oboes in 1629 in
one of his works.[11] 

The little Schalmey and the 
tenor Pommer seem* to have 
disappeared in the 17th cen- 
tury; it is the discant Schalmey and the alto Pommer which by 
improvement have become two important members of the modern 
orchestra. The oboe, as such, was employed for the first time in 1671 
in the orchestra of the Paris opera in Pomone by Cambert. The 

first two keys gS ■ I j date from the end of the 17th century. 

It is not known who added the first keys to the oboe; there is, 
however, a drawing of a French Hoboy in an English MS. by the 
third Randle Holme, which formed part of his Academy of Armoury u 
known to have been written before 1688, in which the two keys are 
shown. The instrument must have been well known in England at 
the time, and Randle Holme's rough little drawing fixes the date of 
the transformation approximately as not later than 1680, probably 
earlier, since the oboe was used in Pomone in 1671. According to 
the flautist Quantz 13 the transformation of Schalmey into oboe took 
place when the keys for C sharp and D sharp were added, at about 
the same time as they were added to the flute.

the 18th century much-appreciated improvements in the boring 
of the instrument. The Mtihodc of Sellner, published at Vienna 
in 1825, shows nine keys 

the octave key, which, when opened, establishes a loop or ventral 
segment of vibration in the column of air, facilitating the
production of sounds in the octave higher. Triebert of Pans owes
his  great reputation to the numerous improvements he introduced
in the construction of the oboe. ^ , 

The alto Pommer was but slowly transformed: it was called in 
French " hautbois de chasse," in Italian " oboe di caccia." In the 
1 8th century we find it more elegant in form, but with all the defects 
of the primitive instrument. The idea of bending the instrument 
into a half circular form to facilitate the handling is usually attri- 
buted to "an oboist of Bergamo, one Jean Ferlendis, who was estab- 
lished at Salzburg at about 1760. This is obviously incorrect, since 
Ferlendis would then have been five years old. 1 It has been sug- 
gested that the fact of the instrument's resembling a kind of hunting 
horn used at that time in England probably gained for it the name 
of " corno inglcse," which it still retains (" cor anglais " in French).* 
The first employment of it in the orchestra is referred to Gluck, 
who had two " cors anglais " in his Alceste, as played at Vienna in 
1767. But it was not until 1808 that the cor anglais was first heard 
in the Paris opera; it was played by the oboist Vogt in Alexandre 
chez Apelle by Catel. The improvements in t manufacture of this 
instrument closely followed those introduced in the oboe. The 18th 
century produced an intermediate oboe between (2) and (3), which 
was called hautbois d'amour, and was frequently employed by J. S. 
Bach. It was a third lower than the ordinary oboe, and was char- 
acterized by the pear-shaped bell with narrow aperture common to 
all wind instruments known as d'ameur to which is due their veiled 
sweet quality. In the Spanish Cantigas, there are two Schalmeys 
with pear-shaped bells. This is in all probability the dougaine 
mentioned in the 13th and 14th-century romances. The oboe 
d'amore fell into disuse after the death of the great German composer. 
It has been resuscitated by the firm of C. Mahillon of Brussels, and 
reconstructed with the # improvements of modern manufacture. 
A similar timbre was artificially produced in the oboe by means of 
mutes or sordini composed of. hollow cones of wood, balls of paper,' 
pieces of sponge, 4 &c. 

After the 16th century we find the instruments which were 
designated by the name of " gros bois," the (5) and (6) of Praetorius, 
transformed into shorter instruments, the Fagott and Contrafagott, 
having a column of air of the same length and form as the Pommers, 
but the instrument itself consisted of two conical tubes communicat- 
ing at the lower part of the instrument ; they were pierced in a single 
piece of wood. It is probably owing to the aspect of this double 
~>ipe that the satirical name of fagot was given, preserved in 
talian as fagotto, and in German as Fagott. A canon of 
Ferrara named Afranio has been named as the author of the 
transformation, about 153Q, of the bass Pommer, but Count 
Valdrighi, the curator of the Estense library, 6 and Wasielewski,' 
who has reproduced the drawing of Afranio's invention, deprive

him of the merit of the innovation. The fagottino was transformed 
in the same fashion. 

Sigismund Schnitzcr of Nuremberg 7 acquired a great reputation in 
the 16th century for making the " basson," a French word substi- 
tuted for the old fagot, and adopted in England as bassoon. His 
instrument had only two keys 
c : 
2P 

We cannot tell when 
the bassoon gained its present form, but it was probably at the 
end of the 1 7th century. It was used in the orchestra in 
Germany by H. Schiitz in 1619 («'r.), 8 and in 1625, 5 fagotti were 
in use. 8 

Cesti, in his grand opera't/ Porno d'oro™ which was performed with 
the utmost brilliancy at < the nuptials of the emperor Leopold in 
Vienna, where printed editions of 1667 and 1668 are preserved, used 
fagotti combined with two cornets, three trombones and a regal to 
suggest the terrors of Hades. 

Michael Praetorius (16 18) expressly mentions the fagotto as an 
orchestral instrument. 

In France it was used with the oboe in 1671 in Cambert's Pomona 
in the newly founded French Opera, for which Cambert & Perrin 
had received in 1669 a Royal Privilege expiring in 1672, and there- 
after granted to Lully. 

It had three keys then

The B flat key render- 
ing a lengthening of the instrument necessary, we may suppose 
it took its modern form at that epoch. The fourth key 

is found in a bassoon stamped Stanesby Junior, London, 1747," 
and also in one without maker's name, obviously earlier, to judge by 
the very early pattern of the keys. 12 The bassoon appears with 
four keys in the Encyclopidie of Diderot and d'Alcmbert (Paris, 
1 751-1765). The number of keys increased by the beginning of the 
present century to eight, viz. 
>>J_jitd , and two 
keys to facilitate the production of acute harmonics. It was im- 
proved by Almenrader in Germany, Savari, and more recently 
Triebert and Goumas, Paris, and C. Mahillon, Brussels. (See also 
Bassoon.) 

The reform in the construction of the flute due to Theobald Boehm 
of Munich about 1840, a reform which principally consisted in the 
rational division of the tube by the position of the lateral holes, 

Erompted Triebert to try to adapt the innovation to the oboes and 
assoons; but he failed, because the application of the system 
denaturalized the timbre of the instruments, which it was necessary, 
before all things, to preserve, but further improvements made upon 
the same lines by Barret and later by Rudall Carte, have trans- 
formed the oboe into the most delicate and perfect of reed instru- 
ments. In 1856 a French bandmaster, M. Sarrus, thought out the 
construction of a family of brass instruments with conical tubes 
pierced at regular distances, which, by diminishing the length of the 
air column, has rendered a series of fundamental sounds easy — 
more equal and free in timbre than that of the oboe family. Gautrot 
of Paris realized the inventor's idea, and, under the name of " sarruso- 
phones," has created a complete family, from the sopranino in 
E flat to the contrabass in B flat, of which his firm preserves the 
monopoly. 

In order to replace the old double-bassoon of wood, the firm of 
C. Mahillon, Brussels, produced in 1868, a reed contrabass of metal, 
since much used in orchestras and military bands. The first idea of this 
instrument goes back to 1839, and is attributed to Schollnast & Son 
of Pressburg. It is a conical brass tube of very large proportions, 
with lateral holes placed as theory demands, in geometrical relation, 
with a diameter almost equal to the section of theltube at the 
point where the hole is cut. From this it results that for each sound 
one key only is required, and the seventeen keys give the player 
almost the facility of a keyboard. The compass written for this 
contrabass is comprised between IrESEl and (*j [ but sounds 
an octave lower. See Contrafagotto.

OBOK, a seaport on the north shore of the Gulf of Tajura, 
N.E. Africa, acquired by France in 1862. It gave its name to the 
colony of Obok, now merged in the French Somali coast pro- 
tectorate (see Somauland: French). The port is separated 
from the open sea by coral reefs, but is only partially sheltered 
from the winds. This led to the practical abandonment of the 
town by the French, who in 1896 transferred to Jibuti, on the 
opposite shore of the Gulf of Tajura, the seat of government of 
the colony. Obok is connected with Aden and Jibuti by sub-

O'BRIEN, WILLIAM SMITH (1 803-1864), Irish revolutionary 
politician, son of Sir Edward O'Brien, a descendant of Brian 
Boroimhe (d. roi4), king of Ireland (see Clare), was born 
in Co. Clare on the 17th of October 1803, and received his 
education at Harrow and at Cambridge. He took the additional 
name of Smith on inheriting his maternal grandfather's estates 
in Limerick. He entered parliament in 1828 as member for 
Ennis, and from r 83 5 to 1848 represented the county of Limerick. 
Although he spoke in 1828 in favour of Catholic emancipation, 
he for many years continued to differ on other points from the 
general policy of O'Connell. But he opposed the Irish Arms 
Act of 1843, and became an active member of the Repeal Associa- 
tion. Though he was destitute of oratorical gifts, his arraign- 
ment of the English government of Ireland secured him 
enthusiastic attachment as a popular leader. In July 1846 the 
" Young Ireland " party, with Smith O'Brien and Gavan 
Duffy at their head, left the Repeal Association, and in the 
beginning of 1847 established the Irish Confederation. In May 
1848 he was tried at Dublin for sedition, but the jury disagreed. 
In the following July he established a war directory, and 
attempted to make a rising among the peasantry of Ballingarry, 
but although he was at first joined by a large following the 
movement wanted cohesion, and the vacillating crowd dispersed 
as soon as news reached them of the approach of the dragoons. 
O'Brien was arrested at Thurles, tried and sentenced to death. 
The sentence was, however, commuted to transportation to 
Tasmania for life. In February 1854 he received his liberty on 
condition of never revisiting the United Kingdom; and in May 
1856 he obtained a full pardon, and returned to Ireland. In 
1856 he published Principles of Government , or Meditations in 
Exile. He died at Bangor, north Wales, on the 18th of June, 
1864. He had five sons and two daughters. His eldest brother, 
Lucius, became 13th Baron Inchiquin in 1855, as heir male to 
the 3rd marquis of Thomond, at whose death in 1855 the mar- 
quisate of Thomond and the earldom of Inchiquin became 
extinct. (See Inchiquin, ist Earl of.) 


OBSCENITY (from the adjective " obscene," Lat. obscenus, 
evil-looking, filthy). By English law it is an indictable mis- 
demeanour to show an obscene exhibition or to publish any 
obscene matter, whether it be in writing or by pictures, effigy 
or otherwise. The precise meaning of " obscene " is, however, 
decidedly ambiguous. It has been defined as " something offen- 
sive to modesty or decency, or expressing or suggesting unchaste 
or lustful ideas or being impure, indecent or lewd." But the test 
of criminality as accepted in England and Canada is whether 
the exhibition or matter complained of tends to deprave and 
corrupt those whose minds are open to immoral influences 
and who are likely to visit the exhibition, or to see the matter 
published. If the exhibition or publication is calculated to have 
this effect, the motive of the publisher or exhibitor is immaterial. 
Even in the case of judicial proceedings, newspapers are not 
privileged to publish evidence which falls within the definition. 
In dealing with writings alleged to be obscene, the court and 
jury have to consider the effect of the whole work and not merely 
the particular extract challenged as improper; and in practice 
it is difficult to induce juries to convict the publishers of well- 
known and cld-established works of real literary quality on the 
ground that they contain passages offensive to modern notions 
of propriety. In the case of exhibitions of sculpture and pictures 
some difficulty is found in drawing the fine between representa- 
tions of the nude and works which fall within the definition 
above stated — a difficulty raised in a somewhat acute form 
before the London County Council in 1907 by theatrical repre- 
sentations of " living statuary." 

Besides the remedy by indictment there are statutory pro- 
visions for punishing as vagabonds persons who expose to 
public view in public streets or adjacent premises obscene 
prints, pictures or other indecent exhibitions. These are 
supplemented by similar provisions, applicable to the metropolis 
and to county towns, and (by a statute of 1889) for suppressing 
certain kinds of indecent advertisements. By an act of 1857 
powers are given for searching premises on which obscene 
books, &c, are kept for sale, distribution, &c, and for ordering 
their destruction, and the post office authorities have power 
to seize postal packets containing such matter and to prosecute 
the sender. In 1906 the London publisher of a weekly comic 
paper was punished for inserting advertisements inviting readers 
to acquire by post from abroad matter of this kind. 

The use of obscene or indecent language in public places is 
punishable as a misdemeanour at common law, but it is usually 
dealt with summarily, under the Metropolitan Police Act 1839, 
or the Town Police Clauses Act 1847, or under local by-laws. 

British Possessions. — In British India obscene publications, ex- 
hibitions, &c, are punished under articles 292, 293 and 294 of the 
Penal Code. Special exception is made for representations in temples 
or on cars used for conveyance of idols or kept or used for religious 
purposes. fci those British possessions whose law is based on the 
common law the offences above dealt with are offences at common 
law or under colonial statutes embodying the common law, e.g. 
Queensland Code, 1899, ss. 172, 227, 228, 374 (3) ; Western Australian 
jS 2 (3); Canadian Criminal Code, s. 179. 

In New' South Wales and Western Australia, by acts of 1901 and 
1902, provisions have been made for dealing summarily with in- 
decent and obscene publications based to some extent on the English 
legislation of 1889 against indecent advertisements. In the Colonial 
acts no penalty is incurred if the defence can prove that the in- 
criminated publication is a work of recognized literary merit, e.g. 
Aristophanes or Boccaccio's Decameron t or is a bona-fide medical 
work circulated in the manner permitted by the statutes. 

United States. — Under the Federal Law (Revised Statutes, s. 
3893) penalties are imposed for transmitting obscene matter by the 
U.S. mails; see U.S. v. Wales (1892), 51 Fed. Rep. 41. (W. F. C.) 

OBSEQUENS, JULIUS, a Latin writer of uncertain date, 
generally placed about the middle of the 4th century a.d. He 
is the author of a small extant work De prodigiis, taken from 
an epitome of Livy, and giving an account of the prodigies and 
portents that occurred in Rome between 249-12 B.C. 

The editio princeps was published by Aldus (1508); later editions 
by F. Oudendorp (1720) and O. Jahn (1853, w *th the periochae of 
Livy). 

OBSEQUIES (Med. Lat. obsequiae, formed after class. Lat. 
exsequiae), a term for funeral rites and ceremonies, especially 
such as are carried out with great ceremony. The Lat. ob- 
sequium (from obsequi t to follow close after) produced the 
obsolete English " obsequy," in the sense of ready complaisant 
service, especially of an inferior to a superior, still found in the 
adjective " obsequious." 

OBSERVATORY. Up to a comparatively recent date an 
" observatory " was a place exclusively devoted to the taking 
of astronomical observations, although frequently a rough 
account of the weather was kept. When the progress of terres- 
trial magnetism and meteorology began to make regular observa- 
tions necessary, the duty of taking these was often thrown on 
astronomical observatories, although in some cases separate 
institutions were created for the purpose. In this article the 
astronomical observatories will be chiefly considered. 

Up to about 300 B.C. it can scarcely be said that an observatory 
existed anywhere, as the crude observations of the heavens then 
taken were only made by individuals and at intervals, employing 
the simplest possible apparatus. Thus, according to Strabo. 

Eudoxus had an observatory at Cnidus. But, when philo- 
sophical speculation had exhausted its resources, and an accumu- 
lation of facts was found to be necessary before the knowledge 
of the construction of the universe could advance farther, the 
first observatory was founded at Alexandria, and continued in 
activity for about four hundred years, or until the middle or 
end of the 2nd century of the Christian era. Hipparchus of 
Rhodes, the founder of modern astronomy, by repeating ob- 
servations made at Alexandria, discovered the precession of 
the equinoxes, and investigated with considerable success the 
motions of the sun, moon and planets. His work was continued 
by more or less distinguished astronomers, until Ptolemy (in 
the 2nd century a.d.) gave the astronomy of Alexandria its 
final development. When science again began to be cultivated 
after the dark ages which followed, we find several observatories 
founded by Arabian princes; first one at Damascus, next one 
at Bagdad built by the caliph Al-Mamun early in the 9th 
century, then one on the Mokattam near Cairo, built for Ibn 
Yunis by the caliph IJakim (about 1000 a.d.), where the IJaki- 
mite tables of the sun, moon and planets were constructed. The 
Mongol khans followed the example; thus arose the splendid 
observatory at Maragha in the north-west of Persia, founded 
about a.d. 1260 by Hulagu Khan, where Nasir Uddin constructed 
the Ilohkhanic tables; and in the 15th century the observatory 
at Samarkand was founded by Ulugh Beg, and served not only 
in the construction of new planetary tables but also in the forma- 
tion of a new catalogue of stars. 

With the commencement of scientific studies in Europe in 
the 15th century the necessity of astronomical observations 
became at once felt, as they afforded the only hope of improving 
the theory of the motions of the celestial bodies. Although 
astronomy was taught in all universities, the taking *of observa- 
tions was for two hundred years left to private individuals. The 
first observatory in Europe was erected at Nuremberg in 1472 
by a wealthy citizen, Bernhard Walther, who for some years 
enjoyed the co-operation of the celebrated astronomer Regio- 
montanus. At this observatory, where the work was continued 
till the founder's death in 1 504, many new methods of observing 
were invented, so that the revival of practical astronomy may 
be dated from its foundation. The two celebrated observatories 
of the 1 6th century, Tycho Brahe's on the Danish island of 
Hven (in activity from 1576 to 1597) and that of Landgrave 
William IV. at Cassel (1 561-1597), made a complete revolution 
in the art of observing. Tycho Brahe may claim the honour 
of having been the first to see the necessity of carrying on for 
a number of years an extensive and carefully-planned series 
of observations with various instruments, worked by himself 
and a staff of assistants. In this respect his observatory (Urani- 
burgum) resembles our modern larger institutions more closely 
than do many observatories of much more recent date. The 
mighty impulse which Tycho Brahe gave to practical astronomy 
at last installed this science at the universities, among which 
those of Leiden and Copenhagen were the first to found observa- 
tories. We still find a large private observatory in the middle 
of the 17th century, that of Johannes Hevelius at Danzig, but 
the foundation of the royal observatories at Paris and Greenwich 
and of numerous university observatories shows how rapidly 
the importance of observations had become recognized by 
governments and public bodies, and it is not until within the 
last hundred and thirty years that the development of various 
new branches of astronomy has enabled private observers to 
compete with public institutions. 

The instruments employed in observatories have of course 
changed considerably during the last two hundred years. When 
the first royal observatories were founded, the principal instru- 
ments were the mural quadrant for measuring meridian zenith 
distances of stars, and the sextant for measuring distances of 
stars inter se, with a view of determining their difference of 
right ascension by a simple calculation. These instruments 
were introduced by Tycho Brahe, but were subsequently much 
improved by the addition of telescopes and micrometers. When 
the law of gravitation was discovered it became necessary to 
test the torrectness of the theoretical conclusions drawn from 
it as to the motions within the solar system, and this necessarily 
added to the importance of observations. By degrees, as theory 
progressed, it made greater demands for the accuracy of observa- 
tions, and accordingly the instruments had to be improved. 
The transit instrument superseded the sextant and offered the 
advantage of furnishing the difference of right ascension directly; 
the - clocks and chronometers were greatly improved ; and 
lastly astronomers began early in the 19th century to treat 
their instruments, not as faultless apparatuses but as imperfect 
ones, whose errors of construction had to be detected, studied 
and taken into account before the results of observations could 
be used to test the theory. That century also witnessed the 
combination of the transit instrument and the mural quadrant 
or circle in one instrument — the transit or meridian circle. 

While the necessity of following the sun, moon and planets 
as regularly as possible increased the daily work of observatories, 
other branches of astronomy were opened and demanded other 
observations. Hitherto observations of the " fixed stars " had 
been supposed to be of little importance beyond fixing points of 
comparison for observations of the movable bodies. But when 
many of the fixed stars were found to be endowed with " proper 
motion," it became necessary to include them among the objects 
of constant attention, and in their turn the hitherto totally 
neglected telescopic stars had to be observed with precision, 
when they were required as comparison stars for comets or 
minor planets. Thus the field of work for meridian instruments 
became very considerably enlarged. 

In addition to this, the increase of optical power of telescopes 
revealed hitherto unknown objects — double stars and nebulae — 
and brought the study of the physical constitution of the heavenly 
bodies within the range of observatory work. Researches 
connected with these matters were, however, for a number of 
years chiefly left to amateur observers, and it is only since about 
1830 that many public observatories have taken up this kind of 
work. The application of spectrum analysis, photometry, &c, 
in astronomy has still more increased the number and variety 
of observations to be made, while the use of photography in work 
of precision has completely revolutionized many branches of 
practical astronomy. It has now become necessary for most 
observatories to devote themselves to one or two special fields 
of work. 

It would be difficult to arrange the existing observatories 
into classes either according to the work pursued in them or 
their organization, as the work in many cases at different times 
has been directed to different objects, while the organization 
depends mostly on national and local circumstances. As already 
alluded to above, one of the principal characteristics of the larger 
observatories of the present day is the distribution of the work 
among a number of assistants under the general superintendence 
of a director. This applies principally to the great observatories, 
where the sun, moon, planets and a limited number of fixed stars 
are without interruption being observed, but even among these 
institutions hardly two are conducted on the same principles. 
Thus in Greenwich the instruments and observations are all 
treated according to strict rules laid down by the astronomer- 
royal, while in Washington or Pulkowa each astronomer has to 
a certain extent his choice as to the treatment of the instrument 
and arrangement of the observations. The same is the case 
with the smaller institutions, in most of which these arrangements 
vary very much with change of personnel. 

The way in which the results of observations are published 
depends principally on the size of the institutions. The larger 
observatories issue their " annals " or " observations " as separate 
periodically-published volumes, while the smaller ones chiefly 
depend on scientific journals to lay their results before the public, 
naturally less fully as to details.

A. Public Observatories. 

Greenwich, royal obs., lat. +51 ° 28' 38 -4'. Founded in 1675 for the 
promotion of astronomy and navigation. The obs. have therefore 
from the first been principally intended to determine the positions of 
standard stars, the sun and planets, and above all to follow the 
motion of the moon with as little interruption as possible, both on and 
outside the meridian. Since 1873 spectroscopic obs. and a daily phot, 
record of sun-spots have been taken. The eighth satellite of tupiter 
was discovered photographically in 1908. The obs. is under the 
direction of the astronomer-royal; and from the timeof its first 
astronomer, Flamsteed, the institution has always maintained its 
place in the foremost rank of obs. Thus the obs. of Bradley (ob. 
1762) form the foundation of modern stellar astronomy; but it was 
especially during the directorship ofAiry (18^35-1881) that the obs. 
rose to its present high state of efficiency. There are now two chief 
assistants, six assistants, and a staff of computers employed. m The 
principal instruments now in use are: a meridian circle py Simms 
(and Ransomes and May as engineers), erected in 1850, having a circle 
of 6-ft. diameter and a telescope of 8-in. ap. t Lassell's 2-ft. refl., 
erected 1884; 13-in. phot. refr. with 10-in. vis. o.g. by Grubb; 
28-in. refr. by Grubb; 26-in. phot. refr. by Grubb, with the old 
12-8-in. refr. as guiding telescope; 9-in. phot. refr. by Grubb, and 
30-in. s.g. refl. by Common, the last four being on one stand; 8-in. 
altazimuth by Simms, erected 1896. The 26-in. and the 9-in. were 
presented by Sir H. Thompson. The standard " motor clock " is 
the centre of a system of electrically-controlled clocks scattered over 
the United Kingdom. The magnetic and meteorological department 
was founded in 1838; it contains a complete set of instruments 
giving continuous phot, records. The Observations are published with 
all details from 1750, beginning with 1836 in annual bulky quarto 
volumes; special results — e.g., Star Catalogues, Reductions of Lunar 
end Planetary Observations — are published in separate volumes.

Finished in 1875; is under the Savilian professor of astronomv; 
i2}-in. refr. by Grubb, and a 13-in. refl. made and presented by De 
La Rue. The former has been used for photometric obs. ; the latter 
for taking lunar photographs, by means of which the late Professor 
Pritchard investigated the Hbration of the moon; 13-in. phot. refr. 
by Grubb attached to the I2i-in., used for phot, zone work.

ownership was similarly transferred. Since 1834 the obs. has been 
under the direction of the astronomer-rcyal lor Scotland, who is 
also professor of practical astronomy in the univ. Professor T. 
Henderson (1 833-1 845) began extensive meridian obs. of fixed stars 
with a mural circle of 6-ft. diameter and an 8-ft. transit. A 2-ft.

put up, with which Brinkley observed assiduously till 1827. In 
1868 was erected a refr. of n}-in. ap. by Cauchoix (o.g. formerly 
belonging to and given by Sir J. South), which has been used for 
researches on stellar parallax. A meridian circle by Pistor and

Sir William and Sir John HersckeVs obs. at Slough near Windsor, 
lat. +5i°3o'20*,long.oh.2 m.24s. W. William Herschel settled at 
Datehet in 1782, and at Slough in 1786,. and erected several 20-ft. 
refl. (of 18-in. ap.), and in 1780 his 40-ft. refl. of 4-ft. ap. The latter 
was comparatively little used (two satellites of Saturn were dis- 
covered with it), while the former served to discover about 2500 
nebulae and clusters, 800 double stars, and two satellites of Uranus, 
as also to make the innumerable other obs. which have made the 
name of Herschel so celebrated. Sir J. Herschel used a 20-ft. refl. 
at Slough from 1825 to 1833, and from 1834 to 1838 at the Cape of 
Good Hope, to examine the nebulae and double stars of the whole 
of the visible heavens, discovering 2100 new nebulae and 5500 new

Founded in 1667, when the construction of a large and monumental 
building was commenced by the architect Claude Perrault. J. D. 
Cassini s obs. made the institution for some time the most celebrated 
obs. existing, but later the activity declined, although several 
eminent men, as Bouvard and Arago, have held the post of director. 
Since 1854, when Leverrier assumed the directorship, the obs. have 
been conducted with regularity, and, together with a number of most 
important theoretical works, published in the Annals (Observations 
and^ Memoirs), The principal instruments now in use are: a 
meridian circle by Secretan and Eichens, with an o.g. of 9'5-in. ap., 
another by Eichens (given by M. Bischoffsheim) of 7*5-in. ap., a 
15-in. refr. by Lerebours and 6 runner, a 12-in. refr. by Secretan and

The publication of an annual ephemeris from 1775 to 1875 and 
important theoretical works absorbed most of the time of the 
directors B. Oriani and F.^ Carlini, and the instruments were rather 
insufficient. In 1875 an 8-in. refr. by Merz was mounted, with which

these G. Piazzi observed the stars contained in his celebrated 
Catalogue of 7641 Stars (1814); this work led him to the discovery 
of the first minor planet, Ceres, on the 1st of January 1801. The

Authorities. — In addition to their Annals or Observations, the 
leading national obs. (Greenwich, Paris, Washington, &c.) publish 
annual reports stating the nature of the work and changesin personnel 
and instruments. Short reports from nearly all British obs. are 
annually published in the February number of the Monthly Notices 
R. Astr. Soc, and from most German and some other continental 
obs. in the Vierteljahrsschrifl d. astr. Gesellsckaft. Since 1889 much 
information about American obs. is given in the Publications of the 
Astr. Soc. of the Pacific. Stroobant's Les Observatoires astronomiqucs 
et les astronomes (Brussels, 1907) gives a convenient summary of the 
personnel and equipment of all existing obs. (J. L. E. D.) 

OBSIDIAN, a glassy volcanic rock of acid composition. A 
similar rock was named obsianus- by medieval writers, from its 
resemblance to a rock discovered in Ethiopia by one Obsius. 
The early printed editions of Pliny erroneously named the 
discoverer Obsidius, and the rock obsidianus. Rhyolitic lavas 
frequently are more or less vitreous, and when the glassy matter 
greatly predominates and the crystals are few and inconspicuous 
the rock becomes an obsidian; the chemical composition is 
essentially the same as that of granite; the difference in the 
physical condition of the two rocks is due to the fact that one 
consolidated at the surface, rapidly and under low pressures, 
while the other cooled slowly at great depths and under such 
pressures that the escape of the steam and other gases it contained 
was greatly impeded. Few obsidians are entirely vitreous; 
usually they have small crystals of felspar, quartz, biotite or 
iron oxides, and when these are numerous the rock is called a 
porphyritic obsidian (or hyalo-liparite). These crystals have, 
as a rule, very good crystalline form, but the quartz and felspar 
are often filled with enclosures of glass. 

All obsidians have a low specific gravity (about 2-4) both 
because they are acid rocks and because they are non-crystalline. 
Their lustre is vitreous except when they contain many minute 
crystals; they are then velvety or even resinous in appearance. 
Thin splinters and the sharp edges cf fragments are transparent. 
Black, grey, yellow and brown are the prevalent colours of these 
rocks. In hand specimens they often show a well-marked banding 
which is sometimes flat and parallel, but may be sinuous and 
occasionally is very irregular, resembling the pattern of dama- 
scened steel. In such cases the molten rock cannot have been 
homogeneous, and as it flowed along the ground the different 
portions of it were drawn out into long parallel streaks. As the 
rock was highly viscous and the surface over which it moved was 
often irregular the motion was disturbed and fluctuating; 
hence the sinuous and contorted appearance frequently assumed 
by the banding. Whsn crystals are present they generally have 
their long axes parallel to the fluxion. 

Even when conspicuous and well formed crystals are not 
visible in the rock there is nearly always an abundance of minute 
imperfect crystallizations (microlites, &c). They are often so 
small that high magnifications may be necessary to ascertain 
their presence. Some are globular and others are rod-shaped; 
they may be grouped in clusters, stars, rosettes, rows, chains 
or swarms of indefinite shape. In banded obsidians these 
microlites may be numerous in some parts but few or absent in 
others. The larger ones polarize light, have angular outlines 
like those of crystals, and may even show twinning and definite 
optical properties by which they can be identified as belonging 
to felspar, augite or some other rock-forming mineral. The 
variety of their shapes is endless. Some are black, very thin and 
curved like threads or hairs (trichites); often a group of these 
is seated on a small crystal of augite or magnetite and spreads 
outwards on all sides. Others have hollow or funnel-shaped 
ends and are constricted at the middle like a dice cup. In some 
rocks small rod-like microlites are grouped together in a regular 
way to form growths which resemble fir branches, fern leaves, 
brushes or networks, in the same manner as minute needles of 
ice produce star-like snow crystals or the frost growths on a 
window pane. 

These crystallites (q.v.) show that the glassy rock has a tendency 
to crystallize which is inhibited only by the very viscous state 
of the glass and the rapidity with which it was cooled. Another 
type of incipient crystallization which is excessively common in 
obsidian is spherulites (q.v.) t or small rounded bodies which have 
a radiating fibrous structure. They are of globular shape, less 
frequently irregular or branching, and may be elongated and 
cylindrical (axiolites). In some obsidians from Teneriffe and 
Lipari the whole rock consists of them, so closely packed together 
that they assume polygonal shapes like the cells of a honeycomb. 
In polarized light they show a weak grey colour with a black 
cross, the arms of which are parallel to the cobwebs in the eye- 
piece of the microscope and remain stationary when the section 
is rotated. Often bands of spherulites alternate with bands of 
pure glass, a fact which seems to indicate that the growth of 
these bodies took place before the rock ceased to flow. 

As cooling progresses the glassy rock contracts and strain 
phenomena appear in consequence. Porphyritic crystals often 
contract less than the surrounding glass, which accordingly 
becomes strained, and in polarized light may show a weak double 
refraction in a limited area surrounding the crystal. Minute 
cracks are sometimes produced by the contraction; they are often 
more or less straight, but in other cases a very perfect system of 
rounded fissures arises. These surround little spherules of glass 
which are detached when the rock is struck with a hammer. 
There may be concentric series of cracks one within another. 
The minute globular bodies have occasionally a sub-pearly lustre, 
and glassy rocks which possess this structure have been called 
perlites (q.v.). If we take a thin layer of natural Canada balsam 
and heat it strongly for a little time most of the volatile oils are 
driven out of it. When it cools it becomes hard, but if before it 
is quite cold we plunge it into cold water a very perfect perlitic 
structure will arise in it. Occasionally the rounded cracks 
extend from the matrix into some of the crystals especially those 
of quartz which have naturally a conchoidal fracture. If the 
matrix, however, is originally crystalline it does not seem 
probable that perlitic structure can develop in it. Hence it may 
be regarded as diagnostic of rocks which were vitreous when they 
consolidated. 

In mineralogical collections rounded nodules of brown glass, 
varying from the size of a pea to that of an orange, may often 
be seen labelled marekanile. They have long been known to 
geologists and are found at Okhotsk, Siberia, in association 
with a large mass of perlitic obsidian. These globular bodies 
are, in fact, merely the more coherent portions of a perlite; 
the rest of the rock falls down in a fine powder setting free the 
glassy spheres. They are subject to considerable internal strain, 
as is shown by the fact that when struck with a hammer or 
sliced with a lapidary's saw they often burst into fragments. 
Their "behaviour in this respect closely resembles the balls of 
rapidly cooled, unannealed glass which are called Prince Rupert's 
drops. In their natural condition the marekanite spheres are 
doubly refracting, but when they have been heated and very 
slowly cooled they lose this property and no longer exhibit any 
tendency to sudden disintegration. 

Although rocks wholly or in large part vitreous are known from 
very ancient geological systems, sucn as^ the Devonian, they are 
certainly most frequent in recent volcanic countries. Yet among 
the older rocks there are many which, though^ finely crystalline, 
have the chemical composition of modern obsidians^ and possess 
structures, such as the perlitic and spherulitic, which are very 
characteristic of vitreous^ rocks. By many lines of evidence we are 
led to believe that obsidians in course of time suffer devitrification, 
in other words they pass from the vitreous into a crystalline state, 
but as the changes take place in a solid mass they require a very 
long time for their achievement, and the crystals produced are only 
of extremely small size. A dull stony-looking rock results, the 
vitreous lustre having entirely disappeared, and in microscopic 
section this exhibits a cryptocrystalline structure, being made up of 
exceedingly minute grains principally of quartz and felspar. Often 
this felsitic devitrificd glass is so fine-grained that its constituents 
cannot be directly determined even with the aid of the microscope, 
but chemical analysis leaves little doubt as to the real nature cf the 
minerals which have been formed. Many vitreous rocks show 
alteration of this type in certain parts where either the glass has 
been of unstable nature or where agencies of change such as percolat- 
ing water have had easiest access (as along joints, perlitic cracks 
and the margins of dikes and sills). Obsidians from Lipari often 
have felsitic bands alternating with others which are purely glassy. 
In Arran there are pitch stone dikes, some of which are very com- 
pletely vitreous, while others are changed to spherulitic felsites more 
or less silicified. The pitchstone of the Scuir of Eigg is at its margins 
characterized by a dull semi-opaque matrix which seems to be the 
result of secondary devitrification. In the same way artificial glass 
can be de vitrified if it be kept at a temperature slightly below the 
fusing point for some days. Window glass exposed to alkaline 
vapours often shows a thin iridescent surface film which is supposed 
to be due to crystallization ; the same change is found in pieces of 
Roman glass which have been dug out of the ruins of Pompeii. 

Obsidians occur in many parts of the world along with rhyolites 
and pumice. In Europe the best-known localities for them are the 
Lipari Islands, Pantellaria, Iceland and Hungary. Very fine obsi- 
dians are also obtained in Mexico, at the Yellowstone Park, in New 
Zealand, Ascension and in the Caucasus. Included in this group 
are some rocks which are more properly to be regarded as vitreous 
forms of trachyte than as glassy rhyolites (Iceland), but except by 
chemical analyses they cannot be separated. It is certain, however, 
that most obsidians are very acid or rhyolitic. The dark, semi- 
opaque glassy forms of the basic igneous rocks are known as tachy- 
lytes. The typical obsidians exhibit the chemical peculiarities of 
the acid igneous rocks (viz. high percentage of silica, low iron, lime 
and magnesia, and a considerable amount of potash and soda).

Obsidian, when broken, shows a conchoidal fracture, like 
that of glass, and yields sharp-edged fragments, which have been 
used in many localities as arrow-points, spear-heads, knives 
and razors. For such purposes, as also for use as mirrors, masks 
and labrets, it was extensively employed, under the name of 
itztli, by the ancient Mexicans, who quarried it at the Cerro de 
las Navajas, or " Hill of Knives," near Timapan. The natives 
of the Admiralty Islands have used it for the heads of spears. 
By the ancient Greeks and Romans obsidian was worked as a 
gem-stone; and in consequence of its having been often imitated 
in glass there arose among collectors of gems in the 18th century 
the practice of calling all antique pastes " obsidians." At the 
present time obsidian is sometimes cut and polished as an 
ornamental stone, but its softness (H=$ to 5-5) detracts 
from its value. Certain varieties, notably some from Russia, 
possess a beautiful metallic sheen, referable to the presence 
of either microscopic fissures or enclosures. The substance 
known as moldavite, often regarded as an obsidian, and the 
so-called obsidian bombs, or obsidianites, are described under 

MOLDAVTTE. (J. S. F.) 


OBSTETRICS, the science and art of midwifery (Lat. obstetrix, 
a midwife, from obstare, to stand before). Along with Medicine 
and Surgery, Obstetrics goes to form what bas been called the 
Tripos of the medical profession, because every person desiring 
to be registered under the Medical Acts must pass a qualifying 
examination alike in medicine, surgery and midwifery. The term 
Gynaecology (q.v.), which has come to be applied to the study 
of the diseases of the female generative system, in its primary 
sense includes all that pertains to women both in health and 
disease. Obstetrics, or midwifery, is more specially that part 
of the science of gynaecology which deals with the care of a 
pregnant woman and the ushering of her child into the world. 

Tokology — the doctrine of parturition — is the most distinctive 
sphere of interest for obstetricians, and here their activities 
bring them into a closer approximation to the work of surgeons. 
As a science it demands a study of the phenomena of labour, 
which in their ordered succession are seen to present three distinct 
stages: one of preparation, during which the uterus dilates 
sufficiently to allow of the escape of the infant; a second, of 
progress, during which the infant is expelled; and a third, of 
the extrusion of the after-birth or placenta. In each of the 
stages analysis of the phenomena reveals the presence of three 
elements which are known as the factors of labour, viz. the powers 
or forces which are engaged in the emptying of the uterus; 
the passages or canals through which the ovum is driven; and 
the passenger or body that is being extruded. The mechanism 
of labour depends on the balance of these factors as they become 
adjusted to each other in the varying phenomena of the several 
stages. The diversities that are met with in different labours 
even of the same woman have led to their being classified into 
different groups. A natural labour is commonly defined as one 
where the child presents by the head and the labour is terminated 
within twenty-four hours. From this it is obvious that no case 
of labour can be defined at its onset. The relation of the factors 
may warrant a favourable expectation; but until the labour 
is completed, and completed within a reasonably safe period, 
it cannot be classed as natural. The element of time has this 
importance, that it is found that, apart from all accidents and 
interferences, the mortality both to mother and child becomes 
greater the longer the duration of the labour. Hence lingering 
or tedious labours, in which the child still presents with the head, 
but is not expelled within twenty-four hours after the onset 
of labour-pains, are properly grouped in a separate class, although 
they are terminated without operative interference. In the 
class of preternatural labours, where the head comes last instead 
of first, there are two subdivisions, according as the child presents 
by the breech and feet, or lies transversely 
as a cross-birth, and has usually to be 
delivered artificially. Operative or instru- 
mental labours vary according as the pro- 
cedures adopted are safe in principle to 
mother and child, such as turning and 
the application of the midwifery forceps; or as they involve 
damage to the infant in the various forms of embryotomy; or are 
more dangerous to the mother, as in the Caesarean section and 
symphysiotomy. A final class of labours includes the cases 
where some complication or anomaly arises and becomes a 
source of danger, independently of disturbances of the mechanism 
or of any operative interference. These complex labours are 
due to complications that may be maternal, such as haemorrhage 
and convulsions; or foetal, such as twins or prolapse of the 
umbilical cord. To cope with these anomalies an obstetrician 
requires all the resource of a physician and all the dexterity of a 
surgeon. 

The interest of obstetricians in their patients does not end 
with the birth of the children, even after natural labours. The 
puerpera is still a subject of care. The uterus, that during its 
nine months' evolution had been increasing enormously in all 
its elements, bas in six weeks to undergo an involution that will 
restore it to its pregravid condition. The allied organs share in 
their measure in the change, all the systems of the body feel the 
influence, and especially the mammary glands take on their 
function of providing milk for the nutriment of the new-born 
infant. A patient with some latent flaw in her constitution 
may pass the test of pregnancy and labour with success, only to 
succumb during the puerperium. Of patients who become 
insane in connexion with child-bearing, a half manifest their 
mental disorder first during the days or weeks immediately 
succeeding their confinement, and numbers more whilst they are 
suckling their infants. A woman may have had an easy labour, 
and may have been thankful at the time for help from a hand 
that she did not know to be unclean; three days later germs 
left by that hand may have so multiplied within her that she 
is in mortal danger from septicaemia. The management of the 
puerperal patient requires not only the warding off of deleterious 
influences, but the watching of the normal processes, because 
slight deviations in these, undetected and uncorrected now, 
may become later a source of lifelong invalidism. It remains 
further to be noted that to obstetricians belong the earliest stages 
of pediatrics in their care of the new-born child. In some old 
works practitioners of this branch of the profession are described 
as 6fx<f>ahor6fAoi t because their first business was to cut the 
umbilical cord. The causes of the high death-rate among 
infants, whether due to ante-natal, intra-natal or neo-natal 
conditions, come under their observation. They have charge of 
the whole wide field of the hygiene, pathology and therapeutics 
of infancy. 

Historical Sketch. — The origin of midwifery is lost in the mists 
of human origins. The learned Jean Astruc, who gave a lead to 
higher critics in their analysis of the Pentateuch by pointing out 
the presence of Elohistic and Jehovistic elements, exercised his 
imagination in fancying how the earliest pair comported them- 
selves at the birth of their first child, and especially how the 
husband would have to learn what to do with the placenta 
and umbilical cord. His speculations are not in the least illumi- 
native. The Mosaic writings let us see women of some experience 
and authority by the side of a Rachel dying in labour,oraTamar 
giving birth to twins, and superintending the easy labours of 
Hebrew slaves in Egypt. The Ebers Papyrus (1550 B.C.), which 
Moses may have studied when he grew learned in all the wisdom 
of the Egyptians, is the oldest known medical production. It 
contains prescriptions for causing abortion, for promoting labour, 
for curing displacements of the uterus, &c. But there is no 
indication as to how labours are to be managed, and with regard 
to the child there are only auguries given as to whether it will 
live or die, according, e.g. as its first cry after it is born sounds 
like nl or bd. 

The story of the rise and progress of midwifery is intimately 
bound up with the history of medicine in general. The obstet- 
rician, looking for the dawn of his science, turns like his fellow- 
workers in other medical disciplines to the Hippocratic writings 
(400 B.C.). Now the father of medicine was not an obstetrician. 
As with Egyptians and Hebrews, the skilled attendants on 
women in labour among the Greeks were also women. But since 
nothing that concerned the ailments of humanity was foreign to 
Hippocrates, there are indications in the writings that are 
accounted genuine of his interest in the disorders of females — in 
their menstrual troubles, in their sterility, in their gestation 
symptoms, and in their puerperal diseases; his oath forswears the 
use of abortifacients, and he recommends the use of sternutatories 
to hasten the expulsion of the after-birth. In the Hippocratic 
writings that are supposed to be products of his followers, some 
of these subjects are more fully dealt with; but whilst the 
physician is sometimes called in to give advice in difficult 
labours, so that he can describe different kinds of presentation 
and can speak of the possibility of changing an unfavourable into 
a favourable lie of the infant, it is usually only with cases where 
the child is already dead that he has to deal, and then he tells 
how he has to mutilate and extract it. So these writings furnish 
us with the earliest account of the accoucheur's armamentarium, 
and let us see him possessed of a paxaipiov — a knife or perforator 
for opening the head; a irUvrpov — a comminutor for breaking 
up the bones; and a eXKvorrjp — an extractor for hooking out 
the infant. The classical writers of Greece give the same impres- 
sion as to the primitive stage of obstetrics. Women, like the 
mother of Socrates, have the charge of parturient women. 
Where divine aid is sought, goddesses are invoked to facilitate 
the labour. Gods or men are only called in where graver inter- 
ference is required, as when Apollo rescued the infant Aesculapius 
by a Caesarean section performed on the dying Semele. Some 
midwives are known to history, and extracts from the writings 
of one Aspasia are embedded in the works of later authors. In 
the great medical school of Alexandria, when the science of 
human anatomy began to take shape, Herophilus rendered a 
service to obstetrics in giving a truer idea of the anatomy of the 
female than had previously prevailed; other physicians give 
evidence of their interest in midwifery and the diseases of women, 
and some experience was gradually being acquired and trans- 
mitted through the profession until we find from Celsus (in the 
reign of Augustus) that when surgeons were called in to help 
the attendant woman they could sometimes bring about the 
delivery, without destroying the infant, by the operation of 
turning. In the 2nd century Soranus wrote a work on midwifery 
for the guidance of midwives, in which for the first time the 
uterus is differentiated from the vagina and instruction is given 
for the use of a speculum. A contemporary, Moschion, wrote 
a guide for midwives which, with that of Soranus, may be said 
to touch the high-water mark of archaic midwifery. It is written 
in the form of question and answer, was much prized at the time 

	xix. 31* 

of the Renaissance, and was used as the basis of the first obstetric 
work that issued from a printing-press. Philumenos wrote a 
treatise of some value at the same epoch, but it is only known 
from the free use made of it by subsequent writers, such as 
Aetius in the beginning of the 6th century. Like Oribasius, who 
preserved in his compilation the work of Soranus, Aetius draws 
largely on preceding writers. His* treatises on female diseases 
constitute an advance on previous knowledge, but there is no 
progress in midwifery, though he still makes mention of turning. 
This operation has disappeared from the pages of Paulus 
Aegineta, an 8th-century author, the last to treat at length of 
obstetrics and gynaecology ere the night of the dark ages settled 
down on the Roman world, and it is not heard of again till a 
millennium had passed. During the centuries when the progress 
of medicine was dependent on the work of the Arabian physicians, 
the science of obstetrics stood still. We are curious to know 
what Rhazes and Avicenna in the 9th and 10th centuries have 
to say on this subject. But they know little but what they 
have learned from the Greek writers, and they show a great 
tendency to relapse to the rudest procedures and to have recourse 
to operative interferences destructive to the child. Interest 
attaches to the work of Albucasis in the 12th century, in that 
he is the first to illustrate his pages with figures of the knives, 
crushers and extractors that were employed in their gruesome 
practices, and that he gives the first history of a case of extra- 
uterine pregnancy. 

We come down to the 16th century before we begin to see any 
indication of the development of obstetrics towards a place 
among the sciences. Medicine and surgery profited earlier by 
the intellectual awakenings of the Renaissance and the Re- 
formation. In anatomical theatres and hospital wards associated 
with universities great anatomists and clinicians began to 
discard the dogmas of Galen, and to teach their pupils to study 
the body and its diseases with unprejudiced minds. But the 
practice of midwifery was still among all people in the hands 
of women, and when in 1513 Eucharius Rocsslin of Frankfort 
published a work on midwifery, it bore the title Der scftwangeren 
Frawen and hebammen Rosengarten. Translated into English 
by Thomas Raynald with the altered title, The Birth of Mankynd, 
it is mainly compiled from Moschion, and the Soranus and 
Philumenos fragments of Oribasius and Aetius, and is intended 
as a guide to pregnant women and their attendant nurses. 
It was illustrated with fanciful figures of the foetus in uiero 
that were reproduced in other works of later date — as in the 
Rosengarten of Walter Reiff of Strassburg in 1546 and the 
Hebammenbuch of Jacob Rueff of Zurich in 1554, the latter of 
which appears in English dress as The Expert Midwife. The 
greatest impulse to the progress of midwifery was given in the 
middle of the 16th century by the famous French surgeon 
Ambroise Pare, who revived the operation of podalic version, 
and showed how by means of it surgeons could often rescue the 
infant even in cases of head presentation, instead of breaking it 
up and extracting it piecemeal. He was ably seconded by his 
pupil Guillemeau, who translated his work into Latin, and at a 
later period himself wrote a treatise on midwifery, an English 
translation of which was published in 161 2 with the title Child- 
Birth; or, The Happy Deliverie of Women. The close of the 
1 6th century is rendered further memorable in the annals of 
midwifery by the publication of a series of works specially 
devoted to it. Three sets of compilations, containing extracts 
from the various writers on obstetrics and gynaecology from the 
time of Hippocrates onwards, were published under the designa- 
tion of Gynaecia or Gynaeciorum — the first edited by Caspar 
Wolff of Zurich in 1566, the second by Caspar Bauhin of Basel 
in 1586, and the third by Israel Spach of Strassburg in 1597. 
Spach includes in his collection not only Pare's obstetrical 
chapters, but the Latin translation of the important Traitte 
nouveaux de Vhysterotomotokie, published by the French surgeon 
Francis Rousset in 1581, which is the first distinct treatise on 
an obstetric operation, and advocates the performance of Cae- 
sarean section on living women with difficult labours. From 
this time onwards evidence accumulates of the growing interest 
of members of the medical profession, and more especially of 
surgeons, in the practice of midwifery, and after the middle of 
the 17th century they began to publish the records of their 
experiences in special treatises. The most important of these 
writers were French — as Mauriceau, Viardel, Paul Portal, Peu 
and Dionis. The work of Mauriceau, which first appeared in 
1668, is specially interesting from its having been translated 
into English in 1672 by Hugh Chamberlen, who in his preface 
made the then incredible statement that his father, his brothers, 
and himself had long attained to and practised a way to deliver 
women in difficult labours without hooks, where other artists 
used them, and without prejudice to mother or child. Many 
years had still to elapse before the secret of the Chamberlens 
leaked out. In the course of this century some women who 
had large experience in midwifery appeared as authors. Thus 
in England Jane Sharp in 167 1 wrote The Midwives 1 Book, or 
the whole art of Midwifery discovered; in Germany, Justine 
Siegemund, in 1690, Die Chur-Brandenburgische Hojf-Wehe- 
mutter; and earlier and better than either", in France, Louise 
Bourgeois in 1626 published Observations sur la steriliti et maladies 
desfemmes. Perhaps they were beginning to feel that there was 
some need to assert their power, for it was during this century 
that parturient ladies began to call in men to attend them in 
natural labours. According to Astruc, Madame de la Valliere 
wished her confinement to be kept secret, and Louis XIV., 
in June 1663, sent for Jules Clement, the court surgeon, to 
superintend the delivery. This was accomplished successfully. 
The king gave him the title of accoucheur. Clement afterwards 
attended the dauphiness and other court ladies, and went thrice 
to Madrid to assist at the confinement of the queen of Philip IV. 
Up till this epoch physicians and surgeons had only been sum- 
moned to the lying-in room by midwives who found themselves 
at the end of their resources, to give help in difficult cases where 
the child was usually dead and the mother often moribund. 
Now that it began to be a fashion for women in their ordinary 
confinements to be under the surveillance of a physician, it 
became possible for men with their scientific training to study 
the normal phenomena of natural labour, and through the 
medium of the printing-press to communicate the results of their 
observation and experience to their professional brethren. 
Hence the books of the men already referred to, and of others 
that appeared later, such as the Traite complet des accouchemens 
of De la Motte, 1721, which is a storehouse of acute observations 
and wise discussion of obstetric measures. In other countries 
than France physicians and surgeons began to take up midwifery 
as a speciality and not as a subsidiary part of their practice, of 
which they were somewhat ashamed (le Bon, one of the writers 
whose work is found in Bauhin's Gynaecia, says: " Haec ars viros 
dedecet "), and it was in Holland that a work was produced that 
has earned lor its author the designation of the Father of Modern 
Midwifery. Heinrich van Deventer, who practised as an ob- 
stetrician at the Hague along with his wife (a Vroedvrow, as 
he was a Vroedmecster), published in 1696 a preliminary treatise 
called Dageraat {Aurora) der Vrocdvrowen, and in 1701 he followed 
it up by a more complete second volume, of which the Latin 
edition that came out simultaneously with the Dutch has a title 
beginning Operationes Chirurgicae Novum Lumen Exhibentes 
Obstetricantibus. It has the supreme value of being the first 
work to give a scientific description of the pelvis, and to take 
some steps towards the development of the mechanism of labour. 
The " obstetricantes " for whom Deventer wrote are both men 
and women. In the early part of the 18th century women had 
still the main and often the sole charge of their parturient sisters; 
but the practice of having a doctor to superintend or to supersede 
the midwives kept spreading among the classes who could, 
afford to pay the doctor's fee; and by the time Deventer's 
treatise was doing its educational work in an English translation, 
as The Art of Midvnfery Improved, in 1716, the doctors were 
getting into their hands the " harmless forceps " with which a 
living child could be extracted without detriment to the mother, 
in conditions where formerly her child's life was sacrificed and 
her own endangered. This life-saving instrument was invented 
in London, but by a man not of English birth. The Huguenot, 
William Chamberlen, fled from Paris to escape the St Bartholo- 
mew massacres, carrying with him to Southampton his wife, 
his two sons, and a daughter. William Chamberlen seems to 
have been a surgeon, and his descendants through four genera- 
tions had large and lucrative practices in London. The eldest 
son Peter, who was old enough when he came to England to 
be able to attest the birth and baptism of a younger brother, is, 
on good grounds, credited with being the inventor of the forceps, 
which for a century was kept a secret among brothers, sons and 
grandsons. Hugh, indeed, a great-grandson of William, and the 
translator of Mauriceau, had offered to sell the family secret for 
10,000 crowns; but his failure to effect delivery in a test case 
that Mauriceau put to him led the profession to believe that 
he was a boastful quack. Palfyn of Ghent, when in Paris in 
1723, putting a work on anatomy through the press, laid before 
the Academy of Science a pair of forceps, which was figured in 
Heister's surgery in 1724. He has thus the honour of first laying 
before the profession a midwifery forceps. But his implement 
was ill-constructed, and never came into general use. Meanwhile 
the knowledge that the Chamberlens were really possessed of a 
serviceable instrument must have stimulated other practitioners. 
Perhaps a colleague with a keen eye may have got sight of it 
on some occasion, or an intelligent midwife had been able to 
describe the " tongs " which she had seen one of the family 
apply. In 1734 Dr Edward Hody published a record of Cases 
in Midwifery that had been written by Mr William Giffard, 
" surgeon and man-midwife." The dates range from January 
1724 to 1731. Amongst the cases are several where he effected 
the delivery by means of the forceps — " extractor," he calls 
it — of which a figure is given; and when Edmund Chapman, 
who practised first at Halstead and afterwards in London, 
published his Treatise on the Improvement of Midwifery in 
i733> be speaks of the use of the forceps as " now well known 
to all the principal men of the profession both in town and 
country." 

In the course of the 18th century the development of mid- 
wifery in the hands of medical men made greater strides than 
in all the preceding ages. The progress was accelerated by the 
establishment of chairs of midwifery in the universities of 
various countries, Edinburgh taking the lead in the appointment 
of a professor in 1726, and Strassburg coming closely after in 
1728. In Strassburg the chair had the advantage of being at 
once associated with a clinical service. Lecturing was carried 
out, moreover, by men who were devoting themselves as 
specialists in midwifery and the diseases of women and infants, 
and were succeeding in developing lying-in institutions for the 
benefit of poor women in labour that became schools of instruc- 
tion both for midwifery nurses and for medical students. Two 
new operations came during this epoch to enhance the powers 
of the obstetrician, viz. symphysiotomy, first introduced by 
Sigault in Paris; and the induction of premature labour, first 
carried out by Macauley in London in circumstances described 
by Denman in the preface to his Midwifery, William Hunter 
in London, Sir Fielding Ould in Dublin, Roderer in Gottingen, 
Camper in Amsterdam, Baudelocque in Paris, Saxtorph in 
Copenhagen, and many other authors contributed to progress 
by their atlases and their' books. But there are three whose 
names stand out pre-eminently because of the influence they 
exerted on the whole obstetric world — Levret, Smellie and Boer. 
Kilian, in his vidimus of the history of midwifery, calls Levret 
" one of the greatest masters in the department that ever lived." 
Of Smellie he says: "Inferior to Levret in nothing,' he excels 
him in much." Boer he characterizes as " the most meritorious 
and important of German obstetricians." Levret improved 
the construction of the forceps, and widened the sphere of their 
applicability; Smellie worked in the same direction, and 
furnished, moreover, descriptions and illustrations of natural 
and morbid labours that are of classical value; and Boer first 
clearly placed pregnancy (which Mauriceau, e.g. had spoken of 
as "a nine months' disease") and parturition ; v *he category 
of physiological processes that might be hindered rather than 
helped by the pragmatical interferences of meddlesome mid- 
wives. 

Throughout the 19th century midwifery continued to advance, 
gynaecology grew into a special department with an extensive 
literature, the mechanism of lahour developed under the clinical 
observations of men like Nagele and the study of such frozen 
sections of cadavera as were made by Braune, the indications 
for interference became more clear and the methods of inter- 
ference more simple and safe, and a whole realm of antenatal 
pathology and teratology was added to the domain of science, 
while practitioners learned the art of saving premature and 
delicate infants by the use of the incubator and proper alimenta- 
tion. Every advance in all the cognate sciences was appreciated 
and applied for the advancement of obstetrics. But there are 
two achievements which will make the 19th century for ever 
memorahle in the annals of midwifery — the abolition of the 
pains of labour and the arrest laid on mortality from the so- 
called puerperal fever. In February 1847 Sir J. Y. Simpson, 
choosing a case where he had to deliver by turning, put the 
patient asleep with ether. Seeing that the uterine contractions 
continued, though the attendant pain was abolished, he pro- 
ceeded to administer ether in cases of natural labour, and in 
November of the same year demonstrated the virtues of chloro- 
form, and so furnished the most serviceable anaesthetic, not only 
to the obstetrician in the lying-in room, hut to the surgeon on 
the battlefield, and to the general practitioner in his everyday 
work. Ignaz Philipp Semmelweiss, assistant in the maternity 
hospital of Vienna, was struck and saddened with the appalling 
mortality that attended the delivery of the women under his 
care, as many as one (in some months three) out of every ten 
of the puerperae being carried out dead. He observed that the 
mortality was much higher in the wards allotted to the tuition 
of students than in those set apart for the training of nurses. 
In the spring of 1847 he saw at the post-mortem examination 
of a young colleague who had died of a poisoned wound, that 
the appearances were the same as he had too often had occasion 
to see at the post-mortem examinations of his puerperae. He 
ordered that every student who assisted a woman in her labour 
must first wash his hands in a disinfectant solution of chloride 
of lime, and in 1848 already the mortality was less in the students' 
than it was in the nurses' wards. Thus the first light was shed 
on the nature of the mischief of which multitudes of puerperal 
patients perished, and the first intelligent step was taken to 
lessen the mortality. When, some twenty years later, Lister 
had applied the bacteriological principles of Pasteur with 
beneficent results to surgery, obstetricians gladly followed his 
lead, and the 19th century beheld added to the comfort of 
anaesthetic midwifery the confidence of midwifery antiseptic 
and even aseptic. 

The most exhaustive treatise on the earlier history of midwifery 
is von Siebold, Versuch einer Geschickte der Geburtshulfe (Berlin, 
1839). (A. R. S.) 


OCALA (a Seminole word for green or fertile land), a city 
and the county-seat of Marion county, Florida, U.S.A., in the 
N. central part of the state, about 100 m. S.W. of Jacksonville. 
Pop. (1900) 3380, (1905) 4493, of whom 2467 were negroes, (1910) 
4370. It is served by the Seabord Air Line and the Atlantic 
Coast Line railways. About 6 m. E. is Silver Spring, the largest 
and best known of the springs of Florida. Its basin is circular, 
about 600 ft. in diameter; it is about 65 ft. in depth, and its 
waters are remarkable for their transparency and refractive 
powers. According to the estimate of Dr D. G. Brinton, the 
spring discharges more than 300.000,000 gallons of water daily, 
its outflow forming what is known as Silver Spring Run, 9 m. 
long, emptying into the Oklawaha river and navigable by small 
river steamers. For the drainage and sewerage of the city a 
subterranean river whose source and mouth are unknown is 
utilized. The city is the seat of the Emerson Memorial and 
Industrial Home (Methodist Episcopal) for negro girls. Ocala 
was settled in 1845, but its development dates from 1880, when 
it was first chartered as a city. In December 1890 it was the 
meeting-place of the National Convention of the Farmers' 
Alliance, which promulgated a statement of political principles 
generally known as the " Ocala Platform." (See Farmers' 
Movement.) 


OCARA, a town of central Spain, in the province of Toledo; 
on the extreme north of the tableland known as the Mesa de 
Ocana, with a station on the railway from Aranjuez to Cuenca. 
Pop. (1900) 6616. The town is surrounded by ruined walls, 
and in it are the remains of an old castle. In one of its parish 
churches is the chapel of Nuestra Senora de los Remedios, in 
which Ferdinand and Isabella were married in 1469. Ocana 
is the Vicus Cuminarius of the Romans, and was the dowry 
that El Motamid of Seville gave his daughter Zaida on her 
marriage with Alphonso VI. of Castile (1072-1109). Near 
Ocana, on the 19th of November 1809, the Spanish under their 
Irish general Lacy were routed by the French under Joseph 
Bonaparte and Marshal Soult. 


OCARINA, a wind instrument invented in Italy, which must 
be classed with musical toys or freaks, although concerted 
music has been written for it. The ocarina consists of an earthen- 
ware vessel in the shape of an egg with a pointed hase and a tube 
like a spout in the side, which contains the mouthpiece. There 
are usually 10 holes in the front surface of the instrument, nine 
for fingers and thumb and a vent hole; the newer models have 
8 holes and two keys. By half covering the holes the semi- 
tones are obtained. 


OTAROLAN (or Carolan), TURLOGH (1670-1738), Irish 
bard, son of John O'Carolan, a farmer, was born at Newtown, 
near Nobber, in the county of Meath. The family is said to 
have belonged to the sept of MacBradaigh, and the bard's 
great-grandfather was a chieftain. The O'Carolans forfeited 
their estates during the civil wars, and Turlogh's father settled 
at Alderford, Co. Roscommon, on the invitation of the family 
of M'Dermott Roe. In his eighteenth year he became blind 
from smallpox. He received special instruction in music,- and 
used to wander with his harp round the houses of the surrounding 
gentry, mainly in Connaught. The famous song Receipt for 
Drinking may be responsible for the allegation that he was 
addicted to intemperate drinking, but Charles O'Conor (1710- 
1791), the antiquary, who had personal knowledge of him, 
gives him a good character in private life. The number of 
Carolan's musical pieces, to nearly all of which he composed 
verses, is said to exceed two hundred. He died on the 25th 
March 1 738, and was buried at Kilronan. 

His poetical Remains in the original Irish, with English metrical 
translations by Thomas Furlong, were printed in Hardiman's Irish 
Minstrelsy (1831). Many of his songs were preserved among the Irish 
MSS. in the British Museum. 


OCCAM, WILLIAM OF (d. c. 1349), English schoolman, 
known as Doctor invincibilis and Venerabilis inceptor, was born 
in the village of Ockham, Surrey, towards the end of the 13th 
century. Unattested tradition says that the Franciscans 
persuaded him while yet a boy to enter their order, sent him 
to Merton College, Oxford (see G. C. Brodrick, Memorials of 
Merion College, p. 194), and to Paris, where he was first the pupil, 
afterwards the successful rival, of Duns Scotus. He probably 
left France about 13 14, and there are obscure traces of his 
presence in Germany, in Italy, and in England during the 
following seven years. It has generally been held that in 1322 
he appeared as the provincial of England at the celebrated 
assembly of the Franciscan order at Perugia, and that there he 
headed the revolt of the Franciscans against Pv^e John XXIL; 
but, according to Little {English Historical Rev^v, vi. 747), 
the provincial minister 1 on this occasion was William of Not- 
tingham. Probably, however, Occam was present at the 
assembly. His share in this revolt resulted in his imprison- 
ment, on the charge of heresy, for seventeen weeks in the 
dungeons of the papal palace at Avignon. He and his companions 
— Michael of Cesena, general of the order, and Bonagratia — 
managed to escape, and found their way to Munich, where they 
aided Louis IV. or V. (q.v.) of Bavaria in his long contest with 
the papal curia. It was for Occam's share in this controversy 
that he was best known in his lifetime. Michael of Cesena 
died in 1342, and Occam, who had received from him the official 
seal of the order, was recognized as general by his party. The 
date of his death and the place of his burial are both uncertain. 
He prohably died at Munich in 1349. 

William of Occam was the most prominent intellectual leader 
in an age which witnessed the disintegration of the old scholastic 
realism, the rise of the theological scepticism of the later middle 
ages, the great contest between pope and emperor which laid 
the foundations of modern theories of government, and the 
quarrel between the Roman curia and the Franciscans which 
showed the long-concealed antagonism between the theories 
of Hildebrand and Francis of Assisi; and he shared in all these 
movements. 

The common account of bis philosophical position, that he 
reintroduced nominalism, which had been in decadence since 
the days of Roscellinus and Abelard, by teaching that universals 
were only flatus vocis, is scarcely correct. The expression is 
nowhere found in his writings. He revived nominalism by 
collecting and uniting isolated opinions upon the meaning of 
universals into a compact system, and popularized his views 
by associating them with the logical principles which were in 
his day commonly taught in the universities. He linked the 
doctrines of nominalism on to the principles of the logic of 
Psellus, which had been introduced into the West in the Summulae 
of Peter of Spain, and made them intelligible to common under- 
standings. The fundamental principles of his system (see 
Scholasticism) are that " Essentia non sunt multiplicanda 
praeter necessitatem " (" Occam's Razor "), that nouns, like 
algebraical symbols, are merely denotative terms whose mean- 
ing is conventionally agreed upon (supposttto), and that the 
destructive effect of these principles in theological matters does 
not in any way destroy faith (see the CentUoghim Theologtcum, 
Lyons, 1495, and Tractatus de Sacramento Altar is). 

In the Opus nonaginta dierum (1330) (written in reply to John 
XXI I. 's libellus against Michael of Cesena), and in its successors, the 
Tractatus de dogmatibus Johannis XXII. papae (1 333-1334), the 
Compendium errorum Johannis XXII. papae (1335-1338) and in the 
Defensorium contra errores Johannis XXII. papae (1335-1339), 
Occam only incidentally expounds his views as a publicist; the 
books are mainly, some of them entirely, theological, but they served 
the purpose of the emperor and of his party, because they cut at 
the root of the spiritual as well as of the temporal supremacy of the 
pope. In his writing Super potestate summi pontificts octo quaestio- 
num decisiones (1339-1342) Occam attacks the temporal supremacy 
of the pope, insists on the independence of kingly authority, which 
he maintains is as much an ordinance of God as is spiritual rule, 
and discusses what is meant by the state. His views on the inde- 
pendence of civil rule were even more decidedly expressed in the 
Tractatus dejurisdictione imperatoris in causis matrtmonialibus, in 
which, in spite of the medieval idea that matrimony is a sacrament, 
he demands that it belongs to the civil power to decicle cases of affinity 
and to state the prohibited degrees. By 1343 there was in circula- 
tion his great work the Dialogus (sec Goldast ii. 398-957), in which 
he attempted to present his views in a complete summary. It 
consists of three parts. The first is the De fautoribus hereticorum, 
and deals with the pope as arbiter in the matter of heresy. The 
second part is the refutation of the doctrines of John XXII. (see 
above treatises). The third was to be in nine sections, of which the 
first and second sections alone remain to us. It is probable that the 
Opus nonaginta dierum and the Compendium errorum were intended 
to form part of the work. His last work, De Electione Caroli IV., 
restates his opinions upon temporal authority and adds little that is 
new. 

In all his writings against Pope John XXII. (q.v.), Occam inveighs 
against the pope's opinions and decisions on the value of the life of 
poverty. The Compendium errorum selects four papal constitutions 
which involved a declaration against evangelical poverty, and insists 
that they are full of heresy. Occam was a sincere Franciscan, and 
believed with his master that salvation was won through rigid 
imitation of Jesus in His poverty and obedience, and up to his days 
it had always been possible for Franciscans to follow the rules of 
their founder within his order. John XXII., however, condemned 
the doctrine and excommunicated its supporters, some of whom 
were so convinced of the necessity of evangelical poverty for a truly 
' Christian life that they denounced the pope when he refused them 
leave to practise it as Antichrist. After Occam's days the opinions 
of Francis prevailed in many quarters, but the genuine Franciscans 
had no place within the church. They were Fraticelli, Beghards, 
Lollards or other confraternities unrecognized by the church and in 
steady opposition to her government. 

Beside the theological and political works above quoted, Occam 
wrote Summa Logices (Paris, 1488, Oxford, 1675) commentaries 
on Porphyry's Isagoge, on the Categoriae, De Interpretation and 
Elenchi of Aristotle. These latter were printed in 1496 at Bologna, 
and entitled Expositio Aurea super totam artemveterem;Quaestiones 
in quattuor libros sentenliarum (Lyons, 1495). 

There is no good monograph on Occam. For an account of his 
logic, see Prantl, Geschichte der Logik (1855-1870) ; for his philosophy, 
see Stockl, Geschichte der Philosophic des Mittelalters (1864-1866), vol. 
ii.; for his publicist writings, see Riezler, Die literarischen Wider- 
sacher der Fapste zur Zeit Ludwig des Baiers (1874). See also 
T. M Lindsay's article on " Occam and his connexion with the 
Reformation," in the Brit. Quart. Review (July, 1872). Among 
ancient documents consult Denifle and Chatelain's Chartularium 
Universitatis Parisiensis, vol. ii. pt. i. (Paris, 1887); Wadding's 
Annates Minorum (ed. Fonseca, vols. 7 and 8, Rome, 1733). For 
a list of Occam's works, see Little's Grey Friars , pp. 225-234.

OCCASIONALISM (Lat. occasio, an event), in philosophy, 
a term applied to that theory of the relation between matter 
and mind which postulates the intervention of God to bring about 
in the one a change which corresponds to a similar change in 
the other. The theory thus denies any direct interaction between 
matter and mind. It was expounded by Geulincx and Male- 
branche to avoid the difficulty of Descartes's dualism of thought 
and extension, and to explain causation. Thus mind and 
matter are to Geulincx only the " occasional " causes of each 
other's changes, while Malebrancbe, facing further the epistemo- 
logical problem, maintains that mind cannot even know matter, 
which is merely the " occasion " of knowledge. 


OCCLEVE (or Hoccleve), THOMAS (1368-1450?), English 
poet, was born probably in 1368/9, for, writing in 142 1/2 he 
says he was fifty-three years old (Dialog, i. 246). He ranks, 
like his more voluminous and better known contemporary 
Lydgate, among those poets who have a historical rather than 
intrinsic importance in English literature. Their work rarely 
if ever rises above mediocrity; in neither is there even any 
clear evidence of a poetic temperament. Yet they represented 
for the 15th century the literature of their time, and kept alive, 
however faintly, the torch handed on to them by their "maister" 
Chaucer, to whom Occleve pays an affectionate tribute in 
three passages in the De Regtmine Principum. What is known 
of Occleve's life has to be gathered mainly from his works. At 
eighteen or nineteen he obtained a clerkship in the Privy 
Seal Office, which he retained on and off, in spite of much 
grumbling, for about thirty-five years. He had hoped for a 
benefice, but none came; and in 1399 he received instead a 
small annuity, which was not always paid as regularly as he 
would have wished. " The Letter to Cupid," his first poem 
to which we can affix a date, was translated from UEpistre 
au Dieu d i Amours of Christine de Pisan in 1402, evidently as 
a sort of antidote to the moral of Troilus and Cressida, to some 
MSS. of which we find it attached. " La Male Regie," one of his 
most readable poems, written about 1406, gives some interesting 
glimpses of bis " misruly " youth. * But about 1410 he settled 
down to married life, and the composition of moral and religious 
poem s. His longest work , The Regement of Princes^ or De Regtmine 
Principum, written for Prince Hal shortly before his accession, 
is a tedious homily on the virtues and vices, imitated from 
Aegidius de Colonna's work of the same name, from the sup- 
posititious epistle of Aristotle, known as the Secreta secretorum, 
and the work of Jacques de Cessoles (fl. 1300) englished later 
by Caxton as The Game and Playe of Ckesse. It is relieved by 
a proem, about a third of the whole, containing some further 
reminiscences of London tavern and club fife, in the form of 
dialogue between the poet and a beggar. On the accession of 
Henry V. Occleve turned his muse to the service of orthodoxy 
and the Church, .and one of his poems is a remonstrance addressed 
to Oldcastle, calling upon him to " rise up, a manly knight, out 
of the slough of heresy." Then a long illness was followed for 
a time 5 as he tells us, by insanity. His " Dialog with a Friend," 
written after his recovery, gives a naive and pathetic picture 
of the poor poet, now fifty-three, with sight and mind impaired, 
but with hopes still left of writing a tale heowes his good patron, 
Humphrey of Gloucester, and of translating a small Latin 
treatise, Scite Mori, before he dies. His hopes were fulfilled in 
his moralized tales of " Jereslaus' Wife " and of " Jonathas," 
both from the Gesta Rotnanorunt, which, with his " Learn to die," 
belong to his old age. After finally retiring from his privy 
seal clerkship, he was granted in 1424 sustenance for life in the 
priory of Southwick, Hants, on which, with his former annuity, 
he appears to have lived till about the middle of the century. 
A " Balade to my gracious Lord of Yorke " probably dates 
from 1448 or later. 

The main interest for us in Occleve's poems is that they are 
characteristic of his time. His hymns to the Virgin, balades to 
patrons, complaints to the king and the king's treasurer, versified 
homilies, and moral tales, with warnings to heretics like Old- 
castle, are illustrative of the blight that had fallen upon poetry 
on the death of Chaucer. The nearest approach to the realistic 
touch of his master is to be found in Occleve's " Male Regie." 
But these pictures of 15th-century London are without even the 
occasional flash of humour that lightens up Lydgate's London 
Lackpenny. Yet Occleve has at least the negative virtue of 
knowing the limits of his powers. He says simply what he 
means, and does not affect what he does not feel. A Londoner, 
to whom the country was evidently a bore, he has not afflicted 
lis with artificial May mornings; and it is doubtful whether a 
single reference to nature can be found among his poems. He 
has yet another distinction among his contemporaries: he wrote 
no allegory. Whether we ascribe it to his lack of " engine," or 
to the influence of Chaucer when in his later years he had dis- 
covered the limitations of this poetic form, we cannot but be 
grateful to the poet who has spared us. As a metrist Occleve is 
also modest of his powers. He confesses that 

	Fader Chaucer fayn wolde ban me taught, 
	But I was dul and learned lite or naught; 

and it is true that the scansion of his verses seems occasionally 
to require, in French fashion, an accent on an unstressed syllable. 
Yet his seven-line (or rime toy die) and eight-line stanzas, to which 
he limited himself, are perhaps more frequently reminiscent of 
Chaucer's rhythm than are those of Lydgate. 

A poem, " Ad beatam Virginem," generally known as the " Mother 
of God," and once attributed to Chaucer, is copied among Occleve's 
works in MS. Phillipps 8151 (Cheltenham), and may thus be regarded 
as his work. Occleve found an admirer in the 1 7th century in William 
Browne, who included his " Jonathas " in the Shepheards Pipe 
(1614). Browne added a eulogy b of the old poet, whose works he 
intended to publish in their entirety (Works, ed. W. C. Hazlitt, 
1869, ii. 196-198). In 1796 George Mason printed six Poems by 
Thomas Hoccleve never before printed . . . ; ' De Regimine Prin- 
cipum " was printed for the Roxburghe Club in 1860, and by the 
Early English Text Society in 1897. See Dr F. J. Furnivall's intro- 
duction to Hoccleve*s Works; I. The Minor Poems, in the Phillipps 
MS. 8151, and the Durham MS. III. 9 (Early English Text Society, 
1892). (W. S. M.) 


OCCULTATION (from Lat. occultare, the frequentative of 
occulere t to hide), in astronomy, the hiding of one celestial body 
by another passing in front of it; commonly the passage of the 
moon or of a planet between the observer and a star or another 
planet. 


OCEAN and OCEANOGRAPHY. "Ocean" is the name 
applied to the great connected sheet of water which covers the 
greater part of the surface of the Earth. It is convenient to 
divide the subject-matter of physical geography into the atmo- 
sphere, hydrosphere and lithosphere, and in this sense the ocean 
is less than the hydrosphere in so far as the latter term includes 
also the water lying on or flowing over the surface of the land. 
The conception of an encompassing ocean bounding the habitable 
world is found in the creation myths of the most ancient civiliza- 
tions. The Babylonians looked on the world as a vast round 
mountain rising from the midst of a universal sheet of water. 
In the Hebrew scriptures the waters were gathered together in 
one place at the word of God, and the dry land appeared. The 
Ionian geographers looked on the circular disk of the habitable 
world as surrounded by a mighty stream named Oceanus, the 
name of the primeval god, father of gods and men, and thus the 
bond of union between heaven and earth. The Greek word 
&Ktav6$ is related to the Sanskrit aqayanasj " the encompassing." 
Philologists do not know of any related word in Semitic languages. 
Pictet, however, recognizes allied forms in Celtic languages, e.g. 
the Irish aigean and Cymric eigiawnJ 

Since the Pythagorean school of philosophy upheld the 
spherical as against the disk-shaped world, some of the ancient 
geographers, including Eratosthenes and Strabo, looked upon 
the hydrosphere as forming two belts at right angles to each 
other, one belt of ocean following the equator, the other sur- 
rounding the earth from pole to pole as in the Una quadrifida 
of Macrobius; while others, including Aristotle and Ptolemy, 
looked upon the inhabited land, or oikumene, as occupying the 
greater part of the earth's surface, so that the Indian Ocean 
was an enclosed sea and India (i.e. eastern Asia) was only 
separated from Europe by the Atlantic Ocean. The latter view 
prevailed and was as a rule held by the Arab geographers of the 
middle ages, so that until the discovery of America and of the 
Pacific Ocean the belief was general that the land surface was 
greater than the water surface, or that at least the two were 
equal, as Mercator and Varenius held. Thus it was that a great 
South Land appeared on the maps, the belief in the prodigious 
extension of which certainly received a severe shock by Abel 
Tasman's voyage of circumnavigation, but was only overthrown 
after Cook's great voyages had proved that any southern land 
which existed could not extend appreciably beyond the polar 
circle. Only in our own day has the existence of the southern 
continent been demonstrated within the modest limits of 
Antarctica. 

Oceanography is the science which deals with the ocean, and 
since the ocean forms a large part of the earth's surface oceano- 
graphy is a large department of geography. The science is 
termed talassografia by the Italians, and attempts have been 
made without success to introduce the name " thalassography." 
Of recent years the use of " hydrography " as the equivalent of 
physical oceanography has acquired a certain currency, but as 
the word is also used with more than one other meaning (see 
Surveying) it ought not to be used for oceanography. 

Like geography, oceanography may be viewed in two different 
ways, and is conveniently divided into general oceanography, 
which deals with phenomena common to the whole ocean, and 
special oceanography, which has to do with the individual 
characteristics of the various divisions of the ocean. This article 
is restricted to general oceanography in its physical aspects, 
the closely-related meteorological, biological and economic 
aspects being dealt with elsewhere. 

Methods of Research. — When research in oceanography began, 
the conditions of the sea were of necessity observed only from 
the coast and from islands, the information derived from mariners 
as to the condition of parts of the sea far from land being for the 
most part mere anecdotes bearing on the marvellous or the 
frightful. In recent times, especially since the rapid increase 
in the study of the exact sciences during the 19th century, 
observations at sea with accurate instruments have become 
common, and the ships' logs of to-day are provided with headings 
for entering daily observations of the phenomena of the sea- 
surface. The contents of the sailors' scientific logs were brought 
together by the American enthusiast in the study of the sea, 
Matthew Fontaine Maury (1806-1873), whose methods and 
plans were discussed and adopted at international congresses held 
in Brussels in 1853 and in London in 1873. By 1904 more than 
6800 of these meteorological logs with 7,000,000 observations 
had been accumulated by the Meteorological Office in London; 
20,000 with 10,600,000 observations by the German Marine 
Observatory at Hamburg; 4700 with 3,300,000 observations 
by the Central Institute of the Netherlands at de Bilt near 
Utrecht. The Hydrographic Office of the United States had 
collected 3800 meteorological logs with 3,200,000 entries before 
1888; but since that time the logs have contained only one 
observation daily (at Greenwich noon) and of these 2,380,000 
entries had been received by 1904. In the archives of the French 
Marine in Paris there were 3300 complete logs with 830,000 
entries and 11,000 abstract logs from men-of-war. The contents 
of these logs, it is true, refer more to maritime meteorology than 
to oceanography properly so-called, as their main purpose is to 
promote a rational system of navigation especially for sailing 
ships, and they are supplied by the voluntary co-operation of 
the sailors themselves. 

While the sailors' logs supply the greater part of the scientific 
evidence available for the study of the surface phenomena of the 
ocean, they have been supplemented by the records of numerous 
scientific expeditions and latterly by publications embodying 
systematic observations on a permanent basis. Valuable 
observations were made in oceanography during the expeditions 
of Captain James Cook and the polar explorers, especially those 
of Sir John Ross in the north and Sir James Ross in the south, 
but the voyage of H.M.S. " Challenger " in 1872-1876 formed an 
epoch marking the end of the older order of things and the begin- 
ning of modern oceanography as a science of precision. The 
telegraph cable companies were quick to apply and to extend 
the oceanographical methods useful in cable-laying, and to 
their practical acuteness many of the most important improve- 
ments in apparatus are due. A second epoch comparable to 
that of the " Challenger " and resulting like it in a leap forward 
in the precision of the methods previously employed was marked 
by the institution in 1901 of the International Council for the 
Study of the Sea. This council was nominated by the govern- 
ments of Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Russia, Germany, 
Great Britain, Holland and Belgium, with headquarters in 
Copenhagen and a central laboratory at Christiania, and its aim 
was to furnish data for the improvement of the fisheries of the 
North Sea and surrounding waters. In the course of investigating 
this special problem great improvements were made in the 
methods of observing in the deep sea, and also in the representa- 
tion and discussion of the data obtained, and a powerful stimulus 
was given to the study of oceanography in all the countries of 
Europe. The efforts of individual scientific workers cannot as 
a rule produce such results in oceanography as in other sciences, 
but exceptions are found in the very special services rendered by 
the prince of Monaco, who founded the Oceanographical Institute 
in Paris and the Oceanographical Museum in Monaco; and by 
Professor Alexander Agassiz in the investigation of the Pacific. 

Extent of the Ocean. — The hydrosphere covers nearly three- 
quarters of the earth's surface as a single and continuous expanse 
of water surrounding four great insular land-masses known as 
the continents of the Old World (Europe, Asia, Africa), America, 
Australia and Antarctica. As we are still ignorant of the pro- 
portions of land and water in the polar regions, it is only possible 
to give approximate figures for the extent of the ocean, for the 
position of the coast-lines is not known exactly enough to exclude 
possible errors of perhaps several hundred thousand square miles 
in estimates of the total area. Speaking generally, we may say 
with confidence that water predominates in the unexplored north 
polar area, and that it is very unlikely that new land of any great 
extent exists there. On the other hand, recent Antarctic ex- 
ploration makes it practically certain that a great continent 
surrounds the south pole with a total area considerably more 
than Sir John Murray's estimate in 1894, when he assigned to 
it an area of 9,000,000 sq. km. (3,500,000 sq. statute miles). 
It is probable that the Antarctic continent measures about 
13,000,000 sq. km. (5,000,000 sq. statute miles); and thus if we 
accept Bessers figure of 509,950,000 sq. km. (196,900,000 sq. m.) 
for the whole surface of the sphere, there is a total land area of 
148,820,000 sq. km. (57,460,000 sq. m.), and a total water area 
of 361,130,000 sq. km. (139,435,000 sq. m.), 29% of land and 
71 % of water, or a ratio of 1 : 2-43. 

Divisions of the Ocean. — The arrangement of the water surface 
on the globe is far from uniform, the ocean forming 61% of the 
total area of the northern and 81% of that of the southern 
hemisphere. Of the whole ocean only 43% (154*9 million sq. 
km.) lies in the northern hemisphere and 57% (206-2 milh'on 
sq. km.) in the southern. If the globe is divided into hemispheres 
by the meridians of 20 W. and 160 E., as is usual in atlases, 
the eastern hemisphere, to which the Old World belongs, has 
62% of its surface made up of water, while the western hemi- 
sphere, including America, has 81%. A great circle can be 
drawn upon a terrestrial globe in such a way as to divide it into 
two hemispheres, one of which contains the greatest amount of 
land and the other the greatest amount of sea of any possible 
hemispheres. The centre of the so-called land-hemisphere lies 
near the mouth of the Loire (47I N. and 2 J° W.), while the centre 
of the so-called water-hemisphere lies to the S.E. of New Zealand 
and eastward of Antipodes Island. Even in the land hemisphere 
the water area (134*5 million sq. km.) is in excess of the land area 
(121 million sq. km.), while in the water-hemisphere the amount 
of land is quite insignificant, being only 24-5 million sq. km. 
compared with 230*5 million sq. km. of water. 

The outb'ne of the water surface depends on the outline of the 
basins in which it is contained. The four great continental 
masses therefore give the ocean a distinctly tripartite form, 
the three great divisions being known as the Atlantic, the Indian 
and the Pacific Oceans, all three running together into one 
around Antarctica. Thus the connecting belt of water is narrow 
as compared with the extent of the oceans from north to south — 
Drake Strait south of South America is barely 400 m. wide, 
from Cape Agulhas to Enderby Land, 2200 m., and from 
Tasmania to Wilkes Land, 1550 m., while the meridianal extension 
of the Indian Ocean is 6200 m., of the Pacific, 9300 m., and of the 
Atlantic, 12,500 m., measuring across the North Pole to Bering 
Strait. These proportions are not readily grasped from a map 
of the world on Mercator's projection, and must be studied on a 
globe. A simple, practical boundary between the three oceans 
can be obtained by prolonging the meridian of the southern 
extremity of each of the three southern continents to the Ant- 
arctic circle. A committee of the Royal Geographical Society — 
the deliberations of which were interrupted by the departure on 
his last voyage of Sir John Franklin, one of the members — sug- 
gested these meridians as boundaries; the north and south 
boundaries of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans being the polar 
circles, leaving an Arctic and an Antarctic Ocean to complete the 
hydrosphere. We now know, however, that the Antarctic circle 
runs so close to the coast of Antarctica that the Antarctic Ocean 
may be left out of account. It has been found more convenient 
to take as northern boundaries the narrowest part of the straits 
near the Arctic circle, Bering Strait on the Pacific side, and on 
the Atlantic side the narrowest part of Davis Strait, and of 
Denmark Strait, then the shortest line from Iceland to the 
Faeroes, thence to the most northerly island of the Shetlands 
and thence to Cape Statland in Norway. It has also been found 
convenient to take the boundary between the Atlantic and 
Pacific, as the shortest line across Drake Strait, from Cape Horn 
through Snow Island to Cape Gunnar, instead of the meridian 
of Cape Horn. * Possibly ridges of the sea-bed running southward 
from the southern continents may yet be discovered which would 
form more natural boundaries than the meridians. The com- 
mittee of the Royal Geographical Society settled the existing 
nomenclature of the three great oceans. Some authors include 
the Arctic Sea in the Atlantic Ocean, and some prefer to consider 
the southern part of the Atlantic, Indian and Pacific Oceans as 
a Great Southern Ocean. Sir John Herschel took as the northern 
boundary of the southern ocean the greatest circle which could 
touch the southernmost extremities of the three southern con- 
tinents. Such a circle, however, runs so near the coast of 
Antarctica as to make the southern ocean very small. Others, 
like Malte Brun (1803) and Supan (1903), take the loxodromes 
between the three capes and call the ocean to the south the 
Antarctic Ocean. G. v. Boguslawski suggested the parallel of 
55 S. and Ratzel that of 40 S. as limits; but in none of these 
schemes has the coast of Antarctica been adequately considered, 
and they have all been too much influenced by the Mercator 
map. Each of the three oceans, Atlantic, Indian and Pacific, 
possesses an Antarctic facies in the southern part and a tropical 
fades between the tropics, and the Atlantic and Pacific an Arctic 
facies in their northern parts. 

Where the ocean touches the continents the margin is in places 
deeply indented by peninsulas and islands marking off portions 
of the water surface which from all antiquity have been known 
as " seas." These seas are entirely dependent on the ocean for 
their regime, being filled with ocean water, though subject to 
influence by the land, and the tides and currents of the ocean 
affect them to a greater or less extent. They owe their origin 
to depressions ot the earth's crust of no very wide extent and not 
running very far into the continental mass, and geologically they 
are of recent age and still subject to change. In these respects 
they contrast with the great oceans which owe their origin 
to the most extensive and the profoundest depressions of the 
crust, date back at least to Mesozoic times, and have perhaps 
remained permanently in their present position from still remoter 
ages. 

Seas may be classified according to their form either as " en- 
closed " or as " partially enclosed " (or " fringing ")• Enclosed 
seas extend deeply into the land and originate either by the 
breaking through of the ocean or by the overflowing of a subsiding 
area. They are connected with the ocean by narrow straits, 
the salinity of the water contained in them differs in a marked 
degree from that of the ocean, and the tidal waves are of small 
amplitude. Four great intercontinental enclosed seas are 
included between adjacent continents — the Arctic Sea, the Central 
■American or West Indian Sea, the Australo-Asiatic or Malay Sea 
and the Mediterranean Sea. There are also four smaller con- 
tinental enclosed seas each with a single channel of communica- 
tion with the ocean, viz. the Baltic Sea and Hudson Bay with very 
low salinity, the Red Sea and Persian Gulf with very high 
salinity. 

The fringing or partially enclosed seas adjoin the great land 
masses and are only separated from the oceans by islands or 
peninsulas. Hence their tidal conditions are quite oceanic, 
though their salinity is usually rather lower than that of ocean 
water. The four fringing seas of eastern Asia, those of Bering, 
Okhotsk, Japan and East China, are arranged parallel to the 
main lines of dislocation in the neighbouring land-masses, and 
so are the Andaman Sea and the Gulf of California. On the 
contrary, the North Sea, the British fringing seas (English 
Channel, Irish Sea and Minch), and the Gulf of St Lawrence 
cross the main lines of dislocation. 

In addition to these seas notice must be taken of the sub- 
ordinate marginal features, such as gulfs and straits. Gulfs 
may be classified according to their origin as due to fractures 
of the crust or overflowing of depressed lands. The former are 
either the extensions of oceanic depressions, e.g. the Arabian 
Sea, Bay of Bengal and Gulf of Arica, or such caldron-depressions 
as the Gulfs of Genoa and Taranto, or rift-depressions like the 
Gulfs of Aden and Akaba. Compound gulfs are formed sea- 
wards by fracture and landwards by the overflowing of depressed 
land, e.g. the Bay of Biscay, Gulf of Alaska and Gulf of the Lion. 
Gulfs formed by the overflowing of depressed lands lie upon the 
continental shelf, e.g. the Gulf of Maine, Bay of Fundy, Bay of 
Odessa, Gulf of Martaban. 

Straits have been formed (1) by fracture across isthmuses, 
and such may be by longitudinal fracture as in the Strait of 
Bab-el- Mandeb, or transverse fracture as in the Strait of 
Gibraltar or Cook Strait; (2) by erosion, e.g. the Strait of Dover, 
the Dardanelles and Bosporus; (3) by overflowing through 
the subsidence of the land, as in the straits of Bering, Torres 
and Formosa. 

Surface of the Ocean. — If the whole globe were covered with 
a uniformly deep ocean, and if there were no difference of density 
between one part and another, the surface would form a perfect 
ellipsoid of revolution, that is to say, all the meridians would 
be exactly equal ellipses and all parallels perfect circles. At 
any point a sounding line would hang in the line of the radius 
of curvature of the water surface. But as things are the water- 
surface is broken by land, and the mean density of the substance 
of the land is 2-6 times as great as that of sea-water, so that 
the gravitational attraction of the land must necessarily cause 
a heaping up of the sea around the coasts, forming what has 
been called the continental wave, and leaving the sea-level 
lower in mid-ocean. Hence the geoid or figure of the sea-surface 
is not part of an ellipsoid of rotation but is irregular. The 
differences of level between different parts of the geoid have 
been greatly overestimated in the past; F. G. Helmert has 
shown that they cannot exceed 650 ft. and are probably much 
less. Recent pendulum observations have shown that it is 
incorrect to assume a uniform density of 2-6 in the elevated 
part of the earth's crust, that on the contrary there are great 
local differences in density, the most important being a con- 
firmation of Airy's discovery that there is a marked deficiency 
of mass under high mountains and a marked excess under the 
bed of the ocean. The intensity of gravity at the surface of 
the sea far from land has been measured ©n several occasions. 
During Nanscn's expedition on the " Fram " in 1 894-1 895, Scott 
Hansen made observations with a Sterneck's half-seconds 
pendulum on the ice where the sea was more than 1600 fathoms 
deep and found only an insignificant deviation from the number 
of swings corresponding to a normal ellipsoid. In 1901 O. 
Hecker took the opportunity of a voyage from Hamburg to La 
Plata, and in 1904 and 1905 of voyages in the Indian and Pacific 
Oceans to determine the local attraction over the ocean by 
comparing the atmospheric pressure measured by means of a 
mercurial barometer and a boiling-point thermometer, and 
obtained results similar to Scott Hansen's. The inequalities 
of the geoid in no case exceed 300 ft. Distortion of the ocean 
surface may also arise from meteorological causes, and be 
periodic or unperiodic in its occurrence, but it does not amount 
to more than a few feet at the utmost. Solar radiation warms 
the tropical more than the polar waters, but, assuming equal 
salinity, this cause would not account for a difference of level 
of more than 20 ft. between tropical and polar seas. The annual 
range of temperature between summer and winter of a surface 
layer of water about 25 fathoms thick in the Baltic is as much 
as 20 F., but this only corresponds to a difference of level of 
1 J in. due to expansion or contraction. 

Atmospheric precipitation poured into the sea by the great 
rivers must necessarily create a permanent rise of the sea-level 
at their mouths, and 'from this cause the level round the coasts 
of rainy lands must be greater than in mid-ocean. H. Mohn 
has shown how the inequalities of what he terms the density- 
surface can be found from the salinity and temperature; and 
he calculates that the level of the Skagerrak should be about 
2 ft. higher than that of the open Norwegian Sea between Jan 
Mayen and the Lofoten Islands. The level of the Gulf of Finland 
at Kronstadt and of the Gulf of Bothnia at Haparanda should 
similarly be 15 in. higher than that of the Skagerrak. Recent 
levellings along the Swedish and Danish coasts have confirmed 
the higher level of the Baltic; and the level of the Mediterranean 
has also been determined by exact measurements to be from 
15 to 24 in. lower than that of the Atlantic on account of evapora- 
tion. Apart from the effects of varying precipitation and 
evaporation the atmosphere affects sea-level also by its varying 
pressure, the difference in level of the sea-surface from this 
cause between two given points being thirteen times as great 
as the difference between the corresponding readings of the 
mercurial barometer. In the north tropical belt of high pressure 
south of the Azores the atmospheric pressure in January is 
0-87 in. higher than in the Irminger Sea; hence the sea-level 
near the Azores is almost 1 ft. lower than in the northern sea. 
In the monsoon region, where the barometer rises 0*38 in. 
between July and January, the level of the sea falls in consequence 
by 5 in. Wind also gives rise to differences of level by driving 
the water before it, and the prevailing westerly wind of the 
southern Baltic is the chief cause of the sea-level at Kiel being 
5 \ in. lower than at Arkona on Rugen. Periodic variations 
of level due to meteorological causes account for the Baltic 
being fuller in the time of the summer rains than in winter, 
when the rivers and lakes are frozen and most of the precipitation 
on the land is in the form of snow. The range on the Arkona 
gauge is from 3-5 in. below mean level in April to 2-75 in. above 
the mean level in August. A similar range occurs on the Dutch 
coast in the North Sea, where the maximum level is reached in 
October, the month of highest rainfall, and there is a range of 
8 in. to the minimum level at the time of least rainfall in early 
spring. In the monsoon regions the half-yearly change from 
on-shore to off-shore winds produces noticeable differences in 
level; thus fifteen years' observations at Aden show a maximum 
in May at the end of the north-east monsoon, and a rapid falling 
off after the beginning of the south-west monsoon to a minimum 
in August, the total range being g\ in. The influence of wind 
on water-level is most remarkable in heavy storms on the flat 
coasts of the North Sea and Baltic, when the rise may amount 
to very many feet. In the region of tropical hurricanes the 
converging wind system of a circular storm causes a heaping 
up of water capable of devastating the low coral islands of the 
Pacific. On the ist of November 1876 a cyclone acting in this 
way submerged a great area of the level plain of the Ganges 
delta to a depth of 46 ft.; here the influence of the difference 
of pressure within and without the cyclone acted in the same 
direction as the wind. The old speculations as to a great differ- 
ence of level between the Mediterranean and the Red Sea, and 
on the two sides of the Isthmus of Panama, which hindered the 
projects for canals connecting those waters, have been proved 
by modern levelling of high precision to be totally erroneous. 

Deep-sea Soundings. — The hand-lead attached to a line 
divided into fathoms was a well-known aid to navigation even 
in high antiquity, and its use is mentioned in Herodotus (ii. 5) 
and in the Acts of the Apostles (xxvii. 29). Greater depths 
than those usually sounded by a hand-line may possibly not have 
been beyond the reach of the earlier navigators, for Strabo 
says " of measured seas the Sardonian is the deepest with full 
one thousand fathoms " (i. 3, p. 53 Cas.). Yet we find that the 
great discoverers of the modern period were only familiar with 
the hand-lead, and the lines in use did not exceed 200 fathoms 
in length. Ingenious devices had indeed been tried in the 17th 
century and earlier, by which a lead thrown into the sea without 
a line detached a float on striking the bottom, and it was proposed 
to calculate the depth by the time required for the float to re- 
appear. The earliest deep-sea sounding on record is that of 
Captain Phipps on the 4th of September 1773 in the Norwegian 
Sea, in 65 N. 3 E., on his return from his expedition to Spits- 
bergen. He spliced together all the sounding-lines on board, 
and with a weight of 150 lb attached he found bottom in 683 
fathoms and secured a sample of fine soft blue mud. He detected 
the moment of the lead touching the bottom by the sudden 
slackening in the rate at which the line ran out. Polar explorers 
frequently repeated those experiments in deep-sea soundings, 
both William Scoresby and Sir John Ross obtaining notable 
results, though not reaching depths of more than 1 200 fathoms. 
The honour of first sounding really oceanic depths belongs to 
Sir James Clark Ross, who made some excellent measurements 
in very deep water, though in a few instances he overestimated 
the depth by failing to detect the moment at which the lead 
touched bottom. The pursuit of these isolated investigations 
received a great impetus from the enthusiasm of the great Ameri- 
can oceanographer Captain Matthew Fontaine Maury, U.S.N. , 
who directed the whole impetuous strength of his character to 
the task of compelling the silent depths of the ocean to tell their 
tale. Instead of the expensive mile-long stout hemp lines used 
by Ross, Maury introduced a ball of strong twine attached to a 
cannon shot, which ran it out rapidly; when the bottom was 
reached the twine was cut and the depth deduced from the length 
of string left in the ball on board. The time of touching bottom 
was judged by timing each 100-fathom mark and noting the 
sudden increase in the time interval when the shot reached the 
bottom. Maury, however, recognized that in great depths 
the surest guarantee of bottom having been reached was to bring 
up a sample of the deposit. To do this with a heavy lead 
attached required a very strong hemp line, and the twine used 
in the American method was useless for this purpose. In 1854 
J.M. Brooke, a midshipman of theU.S.N., invented the principle 
already foreshadowed by Nicolaus Cusanus in the 15th century 
and by Robert Hooke in the 17th, of using a heavy weight so 
hung on the sounding-tube that it was automatically released 
on striking the bottom and left behind, while the light brass tube 
containing a sample of the deposit was easily hauled up. This 
principle has been adopted universally for deep soundings, and 
is now applied in many forms. In 1855 Maury published 
the first chart of the depths of the Atlantic between 52 N. and 
io° S. At this period an exact knowledge of the depths of the ocean 
assumed an unlooked-for practical importance from the daring 
project for laying a telegraph cable between Ireland and 
Newfoundland. Deep soundings were made in the Atlantic 
for this purpose by vessels both of the British and of the American 
navies, while in the Mediterranean and in the Indian Ocean 
many soundings were made in connexion with submarine 
cables to the East. Another stimulus came from the biologists, 
who began to realize the importance of a more detailed investiga- 
tion of the life conditions of organisms at great depths in the 
sea. The lead in this direction was taken by British biologists, 
beginning with Edward Forbes in 1839, and in 1868 a party on 
board H.M.S. " Lightning " pursued researches in the waters 
to the north of Scotland. In 1869 and 1870 this work was 
extended to the Irish Sea and Bay of Biscay in H.M.S. " Por- 
cupine," and to the Mediterranean in H.M.S. " Shearwater." 
The last-named vessel secured 157 trustworthy deep soundings, 
with samples of the deposits, and also observations of temperature 
and salinity in different depths, as well as dredgings for the* 
collection of the organisms of the deep sea. 

These preliminary trips of scientific marine investigation were 
followed by the greatest purely scientific expedition ever under- 
taken, the voyage of H.M.S. " Challenger " round the world 
under the scientific direction of Sir Wyville Thomson and the 
naval command of Sir George Nares. This epoch-making 
expedition lasted from Christmas 1872 to the end of May 1876, 
and gave the first wide and general view of the physical and 
biological conditions of the ocean as a whole. Almost simul- 
taneously with the " Challenger," a German expedition in S.M.S. 
" Gazelle " conducted observations in the South Atlantic, Indian 
and South Pacific Oceans; and the U.S.S. " Tuscarora " made a 
cruise in the North Pacific, sounding out lines for a projected 
Pacific cable. The successor of Sir Wyville Thomson in the 
editorship of the " Challenger " Reports, Sir John Murray, has 
rightly said that since the days of Columbus and Magellan no 
such revelation regarding the surface of our planet had been 
made as in that eighth decade of the 19th century. Since that 
time the British cable-ships have been busy in all the oceans 
making sections across the great expanses of water with ever- 
increasing accuracy, and in that work the government surveying 
ships have also been engaged, vast stretches of the Indian and 
Pacific Oceans having been opened up to knowledge by H.M.SS. 
"Egeria," " Waterwitch," "Dart," "Penguin," "Stork," 
and "Investigator." American scientific enterprise, mainly 
under the guidance of Professor Alexander Agassiz, has been 
active in the North Atlantic and especially in the Pacific Ocean, 
where very important investigations have been made. The 
eastern part of the North Atlantic has been the scene of many 
expeditions, often purely biological in their purpose, amongst 
which there may be mentioned the cruises of the " Travailleur " 
and " Talisman " under Professor Milne-Edwards in 1880-1883, 
and since 1887 those of the prince of Monaco in his yachts, as 
well as numerous Danish vessels in the sea between Iceland and 
Greenland, conspicuous amongst which were the expeditions 
in 1 896-1 898 on board the " Ingolf." The Norwegian Sea was 
studied by the Norwegian expedition on board the " Voringen " 
in 1876-1878, and the north polar basin by Nansen and Sverdrup 
in the " Fram " in 1 893-1 896, the Mediterranean by the Italians 
on the " Washington " and by the Austrians on the " Pola " 
in 1 890-1 893, the latter carrying the investigations to the Red 
Sea in 1 895-1 898, while the Russians investigated the Black 
Sea in 1890-1893. For high southern latitudes special value 
attaches to the soundings of the German deep-sea expedition 
on the " Valdivia " in 1898-1899, and to those of the " Belgica " 
in 1897-1898, the " Gauss " in 1902-1903, and the " Scotia " 
in 1 903-1904. The soundings of the Dutch expedition on 
the " Siboga " during 1890-1900 in the eastern part of the 
Malay seas and those of the German surveying ship " Planet " 
in 1906 in the South Atlantic, Indian and North Pacific Oceans 
were notable, and Sir John Murray's expedition on the " Michael 
Sars " in the Atlantic in 1910 obtained important results. 

Modern surveying ships no longer make use of hempen lines 
with enormously heavy sinkers, such as were employed on the 
" Challenger/ ' but they sound instead with steel piano wire 
not more than fa to fa of an inch in diameter and a detachable 
lead seldom weighing more than 70 lb. The soundings are made 
by means of a special machine fitted with a brake so adjusted 
that the revolution of the drum is stopped automatically the 
instant the lead touches the bottom, and the depth can then be 
read directly from an indicator. The line is hauled in by a steam 
or electric winch, and the sounding-tube containing a sample 
of the bottom deposit is rapidly brought on board. The sounding 
machines most frequently employed are those of Admiral 
C. D. Sigsbee, U.S.N. , of Lucas, which was perfected in the 
Telegraph Construction and Maintenance Company's ships, 
and of the Prince of Monaco, constructed by Leblanc of Paris. 
All attempts to dispense with a lead and line and to measure 
the depth by determining the pressure at the bottom have 
hitherto failed when applied to depths greater than 200 fathoms; 
a new hydraulic manometer has been tried on board the German 
surveying ship " Planet." A. Siemens has pointed out that a 
profile of the sea-bed can be delineated by taking account of 
the varying strain on a submarine cable while it is being laid, 
and the average depth of a section can thus be ascertained with 
some accuracy. All deep-sea measurements are subject to 
uncertainty because the sounding machine merely measures 
the length of wire which runs out before the lead touches 
bottom, and this agrees with the depth only when the wire is 
perpendicular throughout its run. It is improbable, however, 
that the smooth and slender wire is much influenced by currents, 
and the best deep-sea soundings may be taken as accurate to 
within s fathoms. 

Relief of the Ocean Floor. — Recent soundings have shown 
that the floor of the ocean on the whole lies some 2 or 3 m. 
beneath the surface, and 0. Krummel has calculated the mean 
depth to be 2010 fathoms (12,060 ft.), while the mean elevation 
of the surface of the continents above sea-level is only 2300 ft. 
Viewed from the floor of the ocean the continental block would 
thus appear as a great plateau rising to a height of 14,360 ft. 
Nevertheless, the greatest depths of the ocean below sea-level 
and the greatest heights of the land above it are of the same order 
of magnitude, the summit of Mount Everest rising to 29,000 ft. 
above the sea-level, while the Nero Deep near Guam sinks to 
31,600 ft. (5268 fathoms) below sea-level. Of course the area 
at great heights is very much less than the area at corre- 
sponding depths. Above the height of 15,000 ft. there 
are 800,000 sq. km. (310,000 sq. m.), and below the 
depth of 15,000 ft. there are 120,000,000 sq. km. (46,300,000 
sq. m.); above the height of 20,000 ft. there are on the whole 
surface of the earth only 33,000 sq. km. (12,800 sq. m.), 
while below the depth of 20,000 ft. there are no less than 
5,400,000 sq. km. (2,100,000 sq. m.). According to KriimmePs 
calculation the areas of the ocean beyond various depths are 
.as follows: —

On the whole the floor of the ocean is very smooth in its 
contours, and great stretches can almost be called level. Modern 
orometry has introduced the calculation of the mean angle of 
the slope of a given uneven surface provided that maps can 
be prepared showing equidistant contour lines. If the distance 
between the contour lines is h and the length of the individual 
contour lines /, the sum of their lengths 2 (/), and A the area 
of the surface under investigation, then the mean angle of 
slope is obtained from the equation 

	hX(l) 
	tan a=— ^-'. 

Calculating from sheet A I of the Prince of Monaco's Atlas of 
Ocean Depths, 1 Krummel obtained a mean angle of slope of 
o° 27' 44* or an average fall of 1 in 124 for the North Atlantic 
between o° and 47 N.. the enclosed seas being left out of account. 
In the same way a mean angle of slope of approximately half a 
degree was found for the Adriatic and the Black Sea. Large 
angles of slope may, however, occur on the flanks of oceanic 
islands and the continental borders. On the submarine slopes 
leading up to isolated volcanic islands angles of 15 to 20 are 
not uncommon, at St Helena the slopes run up to 38^° and 
even 40 , at Tristan d'Acunha to 33^°. E. Hull found a mean 
angle of slope of 13 to 14 for the edge of the continental shelf 
off the west coast of Europe, and off Cape Torinana (43°4'N.) 
as much as 34 . Where the French telegraph cable between 
Brest and New York passes from the continental shelf of the 
Bay of Biscay to the depths of the Atlantic the angle of slope is 
from 30 to 41 . Such gradients are of a truly mountainous 
character, the angle of slope from the Eibsee to the Zugspitze 
is 30 , and that from Alpiglen station to the summit of the 
Eiger is 42 . Particularly steep slopes are found in the case of 
submarine domes, usually incomplete volcanic cones, and there 
have been cases in which after such a dome has been discovered 
by the soundings of a surveying ship it could not be found again 
as its whole area was so small and the deep floor of the ocean 
from which it rose so flat that an error of 2 or 3 m. in the position 
of the ship would prevent any irregularity of the bottom from 
appearing. While such steep mountain walls are found in the 
bed of the ocean it must be remembered that they are very 
exceptional, and except where there are great dislocations of 
the submarine crust or volcanic outbursts the forms of the ocean 
floor are incomparably gentler in their outlines than those of 
the continents. Being protected by the water from the rapid 
subaerial erosion which sharpens the features of the land, and 
subjected to the regular accumulation of deposits, the whole 
ocean floor has assumed some approach to uniformity. Still 
there are everywhere gentle inequalities on the smoothest ocean 
floor which give to its greater features a distinct relief. 

In spite of the increase of deep-sea soundings in the last few 
decades, they are still very irregularly distributed in the open 
ocean, and the attempt to draw isobaths (lines of equal depth) 
on a chart of the world is burdened with many difficulties which 
can only be evaded by the widest generalizations. Bearing this 
caution in mind the existing bathymetrical charts, amongst which 
that of the prince of Monaco stands first, give a very fair idea of 
the great features of the bed of the oceans. A definite termin- 
ology for the larger forms of sub-oceanic relief was put forward 
by the International Geographical Congress at Berlin in 1899 
and adopted by that at Washington in 1004. Equivalent 
terms, which are not necessarily identical or literal translations, 
were adopted for the English, French and German languages, 
the equivalence being closest and most systematic between the 
English and German terms. 

The larger forms designated by special generic terms include 
the following. The continental shelf is the gentle slope which 
extends from the edge of the land to a depth usually about 100, 
though in some cases as much as 300 fathoms, and is there 
demarcated by an abrupt increase in the steepness of the slope 
to ocean depths. In the deep sea two types of feature are 
recognized under the general names of depression and elevation. 
The depression is distinguished according to form and slope 
as (1) a basin when of a roughly round outline, (2) a trough 
when wide and elongated, or (3) a trench when narrow and 
elongated lying along the edge of a continent. The extension 
of a basin or trough stretching towards the continent is termed 
an embayment when relatively wide and a gully when narrow* 
The elevation includes (1) the gently swelling rise which separates 

	[1] Carte ginirale bathymUrique des ocians dressie par ordre de S.A.S. 
	It Prince Albert de Monaco, 24 sheets (Paris, 1904). 

troughs and basins in the middle of the ocean, (2) the steeply- 
sloping ridge which interposes a narrower barrier between two 
depressions, and (3) the plateau or wide elevation rising steeply 
on all sides from a depression. The deepest part of a depression 
is termed a deep, and the highest part of an elevation when not 
reaching the surface a height. In addition to these larger forms 
a few minor forms must be recognized. Amongst these are the 
dome, an isolated elevation rising steeply but not coming within 
100 fathoms of the surface; the bank, an elevation coming 
nearer the surface than 100 fathoms, but not so near as 6 fathoms; 
and finally the shoal or reef, which comes within 6 fathoms of 
the surface, and so may constitute a danger to shipping. Similarly 
we may note the caldron or small steep depression of a round out- 
line, and the furrow or long narrow groove in the continental 
shelf. 

According to the resolutions of the International Geographical 
Congress the larger individual forms which have been described 
by generic terms shall have specific names of a purely geo- 
graphical character; but in the case of the minor forms the 
names of ships and persons are considered applicable. In 1899 
A. Supan published a chart of the oceans with a suggested 
nomenclature based on these principles; and the larger forms in 
the Prince of Monaco's great chart also are named in accordance 
with the rule. Although put forward by the highest inter- 
national authority recognized by geographers the system of 
nomenclature has not been adopted universally. In particular 
Sir John Murray considers that only deeps exceeding 3000 
fathoms in depth should be named, and in his charts he has 
named these deeps after persons whether the individuals thus 
honoured had themselves discovered or explored the deeps in 
question or not. Some of the " deeps " to which names have 
been given disappear or are divided into two or three smaller 
deeps when the contour lines representing hundreds of fathoms 
are translated into contour lines representing hundreds of 
metres. A similar change in the contour lines may result from 
the substitution of lines in fathoms for those originally drawn 
in metres, and hence it is extremely desirable that specific 
names should only be given to such features as are pronounced 
enough to appear on maps drawn with either unit. For the 
sake of uniformity it is to be hoped that the system of nomen- 
clature recommended by the International Geographical Congress 
will ultimately be adopted. 

The continental shelves are parts of the great continental 
blocks which have been covered by the sea in comparatively 
recent times, and their surface consequently presents many 
similarities to that of the land, modified of course by the de- 
structive and constructive work of the waters. Waves and tidal 
currents produce their full effects in that region, and in high 
latitudes the effect of transport of materials by ice is very 
important; while in the warm water of the tropics the reef- 
building animals and plants (corals and calcareous algae) carry 
on their work most effectively there. The continental shelves 
include not only the oceanic border of the continents but also 
great areas of the enclosed seas and particularly of the fringing 
seas, the origin of which through secular subsidence is often very 
clearly apparent, as for instance in the North Sea and the 
tract lying off the mouth of the English Channel. A closer 
investigation of the numerous long, narrow banks which lie off 
the Flemish coast and the Thames estuary shows that they are 
composed of fragments of rock abraded and transported by tidal 
currents and storms in the same way that. the chalk and lime- 
stone worn off from the eastern continuation of the island of 
Heligoland during the last two centuries has been reduced to the 
coarse gravel of the off-lying Dune. Numerous old river valleys 
and furrows entrenched in the continental shelf bear witness 
to its land origin. Such valleys are very clearly indicated in 
the belts of the western Baltic by furrows a thousand yards wide 
and twenty to thirty fathoms deeper than the neighbouring 
sea-bed. Amongst the best known of the furrows of the con- 
tinental shelf are the Cape Breton Deep, in the Bay of Biscay, 
the Hudson Furrow, southward of New York, the so-called Congo 
Canon, the Swatch of No Ground off the Ganges delta, the 
Bottomless Pit off the Niger delta, and numerous similar furrows 
on the west coast of North America and outside the fjords of 
Norway, Iceland and the west of Scotland, as well as in the 
Firth of Forth and Moray Firth. 

The seaward edge of the continental shelf often falls steeply 
to the greatest depths of the ocean, and not infrequently forms 
the slope cf a trench, a form of depression which has usually a 
steep slope towards a continent or an island-bearing rise on one 
side and a gentler slope towards the general level of the ocean 
on the other. All the greatest depths of ocean, i.e. all soundings 
exceeding 4000 fathoms, occur in trenches, and there are only a 
few small trenches known (on the west coast of Central America) 
in which the maximum depth is less than 3000 fathoms. Most 
trenches are narrow, but of considerable length, and their steeper 
side is believed to be due in every case to a great fracture of the 
earth's crust. Strong evidence of this is afforded by the associa- 
tion of some of the depressions, notably the Japan Trench and 
the Atacama Trench, with the origin of frequent submarine 
earthquakes. Troughs and rises are features of more frequent 
occurrence and are best described as they occur in the particular 
oceans. 

In the Atlantic the prevailing meridianal direction of the shore 
lines extends to the submarine features also. Captain Sherard 
Osborn in 1870 was the first to recognize that the North Atlantic 
Basin was divided by a central rise running generally from north 
to south into two parallel depressions. In 1876 the " Challenger " 
expedition found that a similar configuration exists in the 
South Atlantic also. As the result of all the deep-sea surveys 
now available we know that the central rise of the Atlantic 
starts from Iceland as the Reykjanes Ridge with less than 1000 
fathoms of water over it in most parts and runs south-westward 
until in 51° N. it widens into what was called by Maury the 
Telegraph Plateau. Continuing southwards the rise joins the 
Azores Plateau, which has in parts a very marked relief, and 
runs thence southward almost exactly in the middle of the 
ocean, becoming gradually lower as it goes. As far as 29 N. 
the depth over it is less than 1500 fathoms, thence to 12 N. the 
depths are between 1500 and 2000 fathoms, and then it rises 
again to about 1500 fathoms and runs eastward under the name 
of the Equatorial Ridge. Crossing the equator in 13 W. the 
rise resumes a southerly direction and from Asceasion to Tristan 
d'Acunha, the depth is in many places less than 1500 fathoms. 
The soundings of Bruce's Antarctic expedition m the " Scotia " 
showed that the rise cannot be traced beyond 55 S. where the 
depths increase rapidly to over 2000 fathoms. The whole length 
of the rise which divides the Atlantic into an eastern and a 
western basin may be taken as 7500 nautical miles. Between 
3o°and 40 S. two lateral ridges diverge from the great Atlantic 
rise, the Rio Grande ridge towards the north-west and the 
Walfisch ridge towards the north-east. The existence of the 
latter, which extends to the African continent, was announced 
by Sir Wyville Thomson in 1876 as a result of his discussion of 
the deep-sea temperature observations of the " Challenger " 
expedition, though the fact was not confirmed by soundings 
until many years later. 

The West Atlantic Trough lying on the western side of the 
Central Rise widens in the north into the North American Basin, 
and its greatest depths appears to be in the Porto Rico Trench, 
where in 1882 Capt. W. H. Brownson, U.S.N., obtained a sounding 
of 4561 fathoms in 19° 36' N., 66° 26' W. The Brazilian Basin 
has also a large area lying at a depth greater than 2500 fathoms 
and culminates in the Romanche Deep close to the Equatorial 
Ridge in o° 11' S., 18 15' W. with a depth of 4030 fathoms. 
The Eastern Atlantic Trough cannot boast of such great depths 
though the Peake Deep with 3284 fathoms sinks abruptly from 
the Azores Plateau in 43 9' N., 19 45' W., and several soundings 
exceeding 2700 fathoms have been obtained in the Bay of 
Biscay east of the meridian of 5 E. The North African Basin 
has several deeps with more than 3300 fathoms to the north- 
west and the south-west of the Cape Verde Islands, but the South 
African Basin is less deep. In the South Atlantic there is no 
connexion between the Central Rise and the Antarctic Shelf, 
for the Indo-Atlantic Antarctic Basin stretches from near the 
South Sandwich Islands towards Kerguelen with depths ex- 
ceeding 2500 fathoms and reaching in places 3100. The Cape 
Trough runs northward from this hasin. It was long believed 
on the strength of a sounding of " 4000 fathoms, no bottom " 
reported hy Sir James Ross in 68° 22' S., 12 40/ W., that the 
Indo-Atlantic Basin was of enormous depth, but W. S. Bruce, 
in the " Scotia," showed in 1904 that the real depth at that point 
is only 2660 fathoms. 

In the Indian Ocean the Kerguelen Rise stretches broadly 
southward, east of the island which gives it a name, to the 
Antarctic Shelf with the greatest depths upon it usually less 
than 2000 fathoms, and it stretches northward beyond New 
Amsterdam to 30 S. This rise is separated from the Crozet 
Rise by a depression extending to 2675 fathoms, through which 
the Kerguelen Trough (which lies north of Kerguelen) is brought 
into free communication with the Indo-Atlantic Antarctic 
Basin. The greater part of the Indian Ocean is occupied by 
the great "Indian Basin, which covers 35,000,000 sq. km. 
(13,500,000 sq. m.) and extends from the Chagos Islands eastward 
to Australia and south-eastward to Tasmania. The Australian 
Shelf rises steeply as a rule from depths of 2500 to 3000 fathoms. 
A hroad depression with depths of from 3300 to 3500 fathoms 
lies to the east of the Cocos Islands and extends into the angle 
between the Malay Archipelago and Australia. On the north 
this depression sinks into the long and narrow Sunda Trench 
south of Java, and here in io° 15' S., 108 5' E., the German 
surveying-ship " Planet " obtained a sounding of 3828 fathoms 
in 1906. The Sunda Trench is distinguished by the wave-like 
configuration of its floor, and this wave-like character is con- 
tinued to the westward of Sumatra with islands rising from the 
higher portions. The western part of the Indian Ocean has been 
shown by the surveys cf H.M.S. " Sealark " and the German 
surveying-ship " Planet " to have a somewhat complicated 
configuration, the island groups and hanks of atolls which 
occur there rising abruptly as a rule from depths of about 2000 
fathoms or more. Between the Seychelles and Sokotra (o°- 
9 N.) there are great stretches of the ocean floor forming an 
almost level expanse at a depth of 2800 fathoms. The Arabian 
Gulf and Gulf of Aden are also very uniform with depths of 
about 1900 fathoms, while the floor of the Bay of Bengal rises 
very gradually northwards and is 1000 fathoms deep close up 
to the Ganges Shelf. 

The Pacific Ocean consists mainly of one enormous hasin 
hounded on the west by New Zealand and the Tonga, Marshall 
and Marianne ridges, on the north by the festoons of islands 
marking off the North Pacific fringing seas, on the east by the 
coast of North America and the great Easter Island Rise and 
on the south by the Antarctic Shelf. The total area of this 
hasin is about 80,000,000 sq. km. (30,000,000 sq. m.), its surface 
heing almost twice that of Asia. Half of this basin lies deeper 
than 2750 fathoms, and the greater part of it helongs to the 
northern hemisphere. From the floor of this vast and profound 
depression numerous isolated volcanic cones rise with abrupt 
slopes, and even between the islands of the Hawaiian group 
there are depths of more than 2000 fathoms. The Society 
Islands and Tahiti crown a rise coming within 1500 fathoms of 
the surface, two similar rises form the foundation of the Paumotu 
group where Agassiz found soundings of 2187 fathoms between 
Marokau and Hao. This greatest of ocean basins contains 
also the largest and deepest trenches. The Tuscarora Deep of 
the Japan Trench (4655 fathoms in 44 55' N., 152 26' E.) was 
famed for many years as the deepest depression of the earth's 
crust. This great trench is continued along the Luchu Islands 
where the cable-steamer " Stephan " sounded in 4080 fathoms, 
and through the Bonin Trench (with a maximum of 3595 fathoms) 
to the famous Marianne Trench in which the U.S.S. " Nero " 
in 1899 found 5269 fathoms in 12 43' N., 145 49' E., the greatest 
depth yet measured. The northern part of the Marianne Trench 
leads to a wave-like configuration of the ocean floor, the depth 
to the east of Saipan being over 4300 fathoms, followed by 
a rise to 1089 fathoms and then a descent to 3167 fathoms. 

The trenches of Yap (4122 fathoms) and Palau (Pelew) (4450 
fathoms) are not immediately connected with that of Marianne. 
To the east of the Philippines a sounding of 3490 fathoms is 
found close to the Strait of St Bernardino and north-east of 
Talaut there is a trench with 4648 fathoms. To the north-east 
the Japan Trench adjoins the Aleutian Trench, where a depth 
of 4038 fathoms has heen found south-west of Attu. Trenches 
of great size also occur south of the equator. The Tonga and 
Kermadec trenches, hoth deeper than 4000 fathoms, stretch 
from the Samoa Islands southwards toward New Zealand for a 
distance of 1600 nautical miles. The deepest sounding obtained 
in the Tonga Trench is 5022 fathoms in 23 39-4' S., 175 4' W., 
and in the Kermadec Trench, 5155 fathoms, 30 27-7' S., 
J 76° 39' W. The steep western sides of these trenches often 
show an angle of slope of 7 . 

The south-western part of the Pacific Ocean has a very rich 
and diversified submarine relief, abounding in small basins 
separated by ridges and rises. There are no depths, however, 
much exceeding 2500 fathoms amongst these depressions. The 
south-eastern part of the Pacific is mainly occupied by the 
Easter Island Rise with depths rarely so great as 2000 fathoms; 
hut close to the continent of South America the Atacama Trench 
is a typical example of the deepest form of depression culminating 
with 4175 fathoms in 25 42' S., 71 31-5' W. The Pacific 
Antarctic Basin occupies the vast region south of 50 S. right 
up to the Antarctic Shelf, with depths ranging down to 2500- 
3000 fathoms, and communicating with the main Pacific Basin 
to the east of New Zealand. 

The greatest of the intercontinental seas, the Arctic,, comes 
nearest to oceanic conditions in the extent and depth of its 
depressions. The soundings of Nansen and Sverdrup on the 
" Fram " expedition indicate that northward from the Siberian 
Shelf the great North Polar Basin has an area of about 4,000,000 
sq. km. (1,500,000 sq. m.) with depths down to 2200 fathoms. 
A rise between Spitsbergen and Greenland separates the Nor- 
wegian Trough (greatest depth 2005 fathoms in 68° 21' N., 
2 5' W.) which in turn is divided from the Atlantic hy the 
Wyville Thomson Ridge which runs between the Faeroe and 
Shetland islands and is covered by only 314 fathoms of water at 
the deepest point. The ridge across Denmark Strait west of 
Iceland nowhere exceeds 300 fathoms in depth, so that the 
deeper water of the North Polar Basin is effectively separated 
from that of the Atlantic. A third small basin occupies Baffin 
Bay and contains a maximum depth of 1050 fathoms. Depths 
of from 100 to 300 fathoms are not uncommon amongst the 
channels of the Arctic Archipelago north of North America, 
and Bering Strait, through which the surface water of the Arctic 
Sea meets that of the Pacific, is only 28 fathoms deep. 

The Central American Sea communicates with the Atlantic 
through the channels hetween the Antilles, none of which is 
quite 1000 fathoms deep, and it sinks to a depth of 2843 fathoms 
in the Caribbean Basin, 3428 fathoms in the Cayman Trench 
and 2080 fathoms in the Gulf of Mexico. 

The Austral-Asiatic or Malay Sea is occupied by a great shelf 
in the region west of Borneo and north of Java, while in the east 
there are eight abruptly sunk basins of widely different size. 
The China Sea on the north has a maximum depth of 2715 
fathoms off the Philippines, the Sulu Basin reaches 2550 fathoms, 
and the Celebes Basin 2795 fathoms. Some of the channels 
between the islands are of very great depth, Macassar Strait 
exceeding 1000 fathoms, the Molucca Passage exceeding 2000 
fathoms, and the Halmahera Trough sinking as deep as 2575 
fathoms. The deepest of all is the Banda Basin, a large area of 
which lies below 2500 fathoms and reaches 3557 fathoms in the 
Kei Trench. A depth of 2789 fathoms also occurs north of 
Flores. The borders of the Malay Sea are everywhere shallower 
on the side of the Indian Ocean than on that of the Pacific, and 
consequently water from the Pacific preponderates in the 
depths. 

The Mediterranean Sea, the best-known member of the inter- 
continental class, is separated from the Atlantic Ocean by a 
ridge running from Cape Spartel to Cape Trafalgar on which 
the greatest depth is only 175 fathoms. The depth increases so 
rapidly towards the east that soundings exceeding 500 fathoms 
occur off Gibraltar. The Balearic Basin, between Spain and the 
rise bearing Corsica and Sardinia, has a maximum depth of 
1742 fathoms, and the Tyrrhenian Basin between that rise, 
Italy and Sicily deepens to 2040 fathoms. The larger Eastern 
Mediterranean Basin stretches eastward from Sicily with large 
tracts more than 2000 fathoms below the surface, and the greatest 
depth ascertained during the detailed researches of the Austrian 
expedition on board the " Pola " was 2046 fathoms in 35 44-8' 
N., 21 46-8' E. The Adriatic Sea though very shallow in the 
north deepens southward to about 900 fathoms, and the Aegean 
Sea has a maximum depth of 1 230 fathoms north of Crete. The 
Black Sea, connected with the Mediterranean by long and narrow 
channels, is occupied in the north by an extensive shelf on which

lies the extremely shallow Gulf of Azov; but the greater part of 
the sea consists of a deep basin, the central part of which is an 
almost flat expanse at a uniform depth of 1220 fathoms. 

The smaller enclosed seas are for the most part very shallow. 
The Persian Gulf nowhere exceeds 50 fathoms, the southern 
part of Hudson Bay does not exceed 100 fathoms except at one 
spot, though in the less-known fjords of the northern part depths 
up to 200 fathoms have been reported. The Baltic Sea exceeds 
50 fathoms in few places except the broad central portion, though 
small caldron-like depressions here and there may sink below 
200 fathoms. The Red Sea on the other hand, though shut off 
from the Indian Ocean by shallows of the Strait of Bab-el- 
Mandeb with little more than 100 fathoms, sinks to a very 
considerable . depth in its central trough, which reaches 1209 
fathoms in 20 N. 

The fringing seas as a rule show little variety of submarine 
relief. The Bass Sea (Bass Strait), Irish Sea and North Sea lie 
on the continental shelf. In the North Sea the depth of 100 
fathoms is only exceeded to any extent in the Norwegian gully, 
which has a maximum depth of 383 fathoms in the Skagerrack. 

Most of the other seas of this class are formed on a common plan. 
Towards the continent there is a broad shelf, and just before the 
chain of islands separating them from the ocean runs a narrow 
and deep trough. In the Bering Sea the trough north of Buldir 
in the Aleutian Islands sinks to 2237 fathoms, and in the Sea of 
Okhotsk, north-west of the Kuriles, to 1859 fathoms. Similar 
conditions prevail in the East China Sea and the Andaman Sea. 
The Sea of Japan has a wide shelf only in the north, the central 
part forms a broad basin with depths of 1650 fathoms. The 
Laurentian Sea (Gulf of St Lawrence) has a narrow branching 
gully running between wide shelves, in which a depth of 312 
fathoms is found south of Anticosti. 

The area, general depth and total volume of the oceans and 
principal seas have been recalculated by Krummel, and the 
accompanying table presents these figures. 

Oceanic Deposits. — It has  long been known that the 
deposits which carpet the floor of the ocean differ in 
different places, and coasting sailors have been accus- 
tomed from time immemorial to use the lead not only to 
ascertain the depth of the water but also to obtain 
samples of the bottom, the appearance of which is often 
characteristic of the locality. 
In depths down to 1 00 fathoms the old-fashioned 
hand-lead, hollow below and " armed " with tallow, suffices 
to bring up a sample large enough to be recognizable. 
Captain Phipps in 1773 secured samples of soft blue 
clay in this manner from a depth of 683 fathoms, but 
as a rule when sounding in great depths the sample is 
washed off the tallow before it can be brought on board. 
Various devices have consequently been attached to 
leads intended to catch and hold the material when soft 
enough to be penetrated. One of the most effective 
early forms was the snapper or " deep-sea clamm " of 
Sir John Ross, a pair of powerful spring jaws held 
apart by an arrangement which when released on striking the 
bottom allowed the jaws to close, biting out and holding securely 
a substantial portion of the ground. A simpler form of collector, 
now almost universally used, is a plain brass tube which is driven 
into the bottom of the sea by the weight of the sounding lead, 
and in which the deposit may be retained by a valve or other 
contrivance, though in many cases friction alone suffices to hold 
the punched-out core. Larger quantities of deposit may be 
conveniently collected by means of the dredge, which can be 
worked in any depth and brings up large stones, concretionary 
nodules or fossils, of the existence of which a sounding-tube 
could give no indication. 

The voyage of the " Challenger " supplied for the first time 
the nucleus of a collection of deep-sea deposits sufficient to serve 
as the basis for comprehensive classification and mapping. 
The " Challenger " collections supplemented by those of other 
expeditions and of many telegraph and surveying-ships were 
studied in detail by Sir John Murray and Professor A. Renard, 
whose monograph, 1 published in 1891, laid the foundations and 

	[1] " Challenger " Reports, " Deep Sea Deposits." 

reared the greater part of the structure of our present knowledge 
on the subject. The classification adopted was a double one, 
taking account both of the origin and of the distribution in depth 
of the various deposits, thus: —

III. Littoral Deposits ^ 

(between high and >■ Sands, gravels, muds, &c. 
low-water marks) J 

Kriimmel prefers to simplify this by grouping the deposits in 
a single category arranged according to their position into: 

(a) Littoral (including Murray and Renard's littoral and shallow 
water deposits [II. and III.]). 

(0) Hemipelagic (including Nos. 6-10 of Deep Sea Deposits). 
(?) Eupelagic (including Nos. 1-5 of Deep Sea Deposits). 

As so denned the hemipelagic deposits are those which occur 
in general on the slope from the continental shelves to the ocean 
depths and also in the deep basins of enclosed and fringing seas. 
The eupelagic deposits are subdivided by Kriimmel into two 
main groups; (a) epilophic? including the pteropod, globigerina 
and diatom oozes occurring on the rises and ridges and in the 
less deep troughs, {b) Abyssal, including the radiolarian ooze 
and red clay of the deepest abysses. 

The littoral deposits include those of the actual shore on the 
wash of the waves and of the surface of the continental shelf. 

Shore Deposits are the product of the waste of the land arranged 
and bedded by the action of currents or tidal streams. On the 
rocky coast of high latitudes blocks of stone detached by frost 
fall on the beach and becoming embedded in ice during winter 
are often drifted out to sea and so carry the shore deposits to 
some distance from the land. Similar effects are produced along 
the boulder-clay cliffs of the Baltic. Where the force of the waves 
on the beach produces its full effect the coarser material gets 
worn down to gravel, sand and silt, the finest particles remaining 
long suspended in the water to be finally deposited as mud in 
quiet bays. A particularly fine-grained mud is formed on the 
low coasts of the eastern border of the North Sea by a mixture of 
the finest sediment carried down by the slow-running rivers 
with the calcareous or siliceous remains of plankton. Pure 
calcareous sand and calcareous mud are formed by wave action 
on the shores of coral islands where the only material available 
is coral and the accompanying calcareous algae, Crustacea, 
molluscs and other organisms secreting carbonate of lime. 
Recent limestones are being produced in this way and also in 
some places by the precipitation of calcium carbonate by sodium 
or ammonium carbonate which has been carried into the sea 
or formed by organisms. The precipitated carbonate may 
agglomerate on mineral or organic grains which serve as nuclei, 
or it may form a sheet of hard deposit on the bottom as occurs 
in the Red Sea, off Florida, and round many coral islands in 
the Pacific. Only the sand and the finest-grained sediments 
of the shore zone are carried outwards over the continental 
shelf by the tides or by the reaction-currents along the bottom 
set up by on-shore winds. The very finest sediment is kept in 
a state of movement until it drops into the gulleys or furrows 
of the shelf, where it can come to rest together with the finer 
fragments of the remains of littoral or bank vegetation. Thus 
are formed the " mud-holes " of the Hudson Furrow so welcome 
as guides telling their position to ship captains making New 
York harbour in a fog. Sand may be taken as the predominating 
deposit on the continental shelves, often with a large admixture 
of remains of calcareous organisms, for instance the deposits 
of maerl made up of nullipores off the coasts of Brittany and 
near Belle Isle. Amongst the most widely distributed of the 

	1 irl \64>ois — on the threshold. 

deposits actually formed on the continental shelf are phosphatic 
nodules; these are especially abundant on the east coast of the 
United States and on the Agulhas Bank, where the amount of 
calcium phosphate in the nodules is as much as 50%. Sir John 
Murray finds the source of the phosphoric acid to be the decom- 
position of large quantities of animal matter, and he illustrates 
this by the well-known circumstance of the death of vast shoals 
of fish when warm Gulf-Stream water displaces the cold current 
which usually extends to the American coast. Glacial detritus 
naturally plays a great part in the deposits on the polar 
continental shelves. 

Hemipelagic deposits are a mixture of deposits of terrigenous 
and pelagic origin. The most abundant of the terrigenous 
materials are the finest particles of clay and calcium carbonate 
as well as fragments derived from land vegetation, of which 
twigs, leaves, &c, may form a perceptible proportion as far as 
200 m. from land. Blue mud, according to Murray and Renard, 
is usually of a blue or slaty or grey-green colour when fresh, 
the upper surface having, however, a reddish tint. The blue 
colouring substance is ferrous sulphide, the upper reddish layer 
contains more ferric oxide, which the predominance of decom- 
posing organic matter in the substance of the mud reduces to 
ferrous oxide and subsequently by further action to sulphide. 
The proportion of calcium carbonate varies greatly according 
to the amount of foraminifera and other calcareous organisms 
which it contains. Blue mud prevails in large areas of the 
Pacific Ocean from the Galapagos Islands to Acapulco. In the 
Indian Ocean it covers the Bay of Bengal, the Arabian Gulf, 
the Mozambique Channel and the region to the south-west of 
Madagascar. In the Atlantic it is the characteristic deposit 
of the slopes of continental shelves of western Europe and of 
New England, being largely mixed with ice-borne material to 
the south of Newfoundland. It is particularly in evidence round 
the whole of the Antarctic Shelf, where it occurs down to depths 
of 2500 fathoms. It is the chief deposit, according to Nansen, 
of the North Polar Basin and, according to Schmelck and 
Boggild, of the Norwegian Sea also, where it is largely mixed 
with the shells of the bottom-living foraminifer Biloculina. 
Max Weber states that blue mud occurs in the deep basins of 
the eastern part of the Malay Sea. In the form of volcanic 
mud it is common round the high volcanic islands of the South- 
western Pacific. 

Red mud may be classed as a variety of blue mud, from which 
it differs on account of the larger proportion of ochreous sub- 
stance and the absence of sufficient organic matter to reduce 
the whole of the ferric oxide. This variety surrounds the 
tropical parts of the continental shelves of South America, 
South Africa and eastern China. 

Green mud differs to a greater extent from the blue mud, and 
owes its characteristic nature and colour to the presence of 
glauconite, which is formed inside the cases of foraminifera, 
the spines of echini and the spicules of sponges in a manner not 
yet understood. It occurs in such abundance in certain geological 
formations as to give rise to the name of green-sand. Green mud 
abounds off the east coast of North America seawards of Cape 
Hatteras, also to the north of Cuba, and on the west off the coast 
of California. The " Challenger " expedition found it on the 
Agulhas Bank, on the eastern coasts of Australia, Japan, South 
America and on the west coast of Portugal. When the pro- 
portion of calcium carbonate in the blue mud is considerable 
there results a calcareous ooze, which when found on the con- 
tinental slope and in enclosed seas is largely composed of remains 
of deep-sea corals and bottom-living foraminifera, pelagic 
organisms including pteropods being less frequently represented. 
The floors of the Caribbean, Cayman and Mexican Basins in 
the Central American Sea are covered with a white calcareous 
ooze, which is clearly distinguished from the eupelagic pteropod 
and globigerina oozes by the presence of abundant large mineral 
particles and the remains of land plants. In this deposit the 
occurrence of calcareous concretions is very characteristic, as 
L. F. de Pourtales pointed out in 1870; they consist of remains 
of deep-sea corals, serpulae, echinoderms and mollusca united 
by a calcareous cement. Similar formations are found in the 
Mediterranean, where a dark mud predominates in the western 
part, passing into a grey, marly slime in the Tyrrhenian Basin 
and replaced by a typical calcareous ooze in the Eastern Basin. 
The bottom of the Black Sea is covered by a stiff blue mud in 
which Sir John Murray found much sulphide of iron, 1 grains 
or needles of pyrites making up nearly 50% of the deposit, 
and there arc also grains of amorphous calcium carbonate 
evidently precipitated from the water. The formation of the 
blue mud is largely aided by the putrefaction of organic matter, 
and as a result the water deeper than 120 fathoms is extra- 
ordinarily deficient in dissolved oxygen and abounds in sul- 
phuretted hydrogen, the formation of which is brought about 
by a special bacterium, the only form of life found at depths 
greater than 120 fathoms in the Black Sea. 

In the Red Sea the " Pola " expedition discovered a calcareous 
ooze similar to that of the Mediterranean, and the formation 
of a stony crust by precipitation of calcium and magnesium 
carbonates may be recognized as giving origin to a recent 
dolomite. 

The terrigenous ingredients in the deposits become less and 
less abundant as one goes farther into the deep ocean and away 
from the continental margins. Still, according to Murray and 
Irvine, finely divided colloidal clay is to be found in all parts 
of the ocean however remote from land, though in very small 
amount, and there is less in tropical than in cooler waters. A 
minute fraction is always separating out of the water, and as a 
prodigious length of time may be accepted for the accomplish- 
ment of all the chemical and physical processes in the deep sea, 
we must take account of the gradual accumulation of even this 
infinitesimal precipitation. As well as the finest of terrigenous 
clay there is present in sea-water far from land a different clay 
derived from the decomposition of volcanic material. Volcanic 
dust thrown into the air settles out slowly, and some of the 
products of submarine and littoral volcanoes, like pumice-stone, 
possess a remarkable power of floating and may drift into any 
part of the ocean before they become waterlogged and sink. 
To this inconceivably slowly-growing deposit of inorganic 
material over the ocean floor there is added an overwhelmingly 
more rapid contribution of the remains of calcareous and 
siliceous planktonic and benthonic organisms, which tend to 
bury the slower accumulating material under a blanket of 
globigerina, pteropod, diatom or radiolarian ooze. When those 
deposits of organic origin are wanting or have been removed, 
the red clay composed of the mineral constituents is found alone. 
It is a remarkable geographical fact that on the rises and in the 
basins of moderate depth of the open ocean the organic oozes 
preponderate, but in the abysmal depressions below 2500 or 
3000 fathoms, whether these lie in the middle or near the edges 
of the. great ocean spaces, there is found only the red clay, with 
a minimum of calcium carbonate, though sometimes with a 
considerable admixture of the siliceous remains of radiolarians. 
Thus red clay and radiolarian ooze are distinguished as abyssal 
deposits in contradistinction to the epilophic calcareous oozes. 

Globigerina ooze was recognized as an important deposit as 
soon as the first successful deep-sea soundings had been made 
in the Atlantic. It was described simultaneously in 1853 by 
Bailey of West Point and Ehrenberg in Berlin. Murray and 
Renard define globigerina ooze as containing at least 30% 
of calcium carbonate, in which the remains of pelagic (not 
benthonic) foraminifera predominate and in which remains of 
pelagic mollusca such as pteropods and heteropods, ostracodes 
and also coccoliths (minute calcareous algae) may also occur. 
Not more than 25% of the deposit may consist of bottom- 
dwelling foraminifera, echini or worm-tubes, and as a rule these 
make up only from 9 to 10%. These peculiarities, combined 
with the striking absence of mineral constituents, distinguish 
the eupelagic globigerina ooze from the hemipelagic calcareous 
mud. Out of 118 samples of globigerina ooze obtained by the 
"Challenger" expedition 84 came from depths of 1500 to 
2500 fathoms, 13 from depths of 1000 to 1500 and only 16 from 

	Scot. Geog. Mag., vol. 16 (1900), p. 695. 

depths greater than 2500 fathoms. Viewed as a whole this 
deposit may be taken as a partial precipitation of the plankton 
living in the upper waters of the open sea. A small proportion 
of organic matter including the fat globules of the plankton 
is mixed with the calcium carbonate, the amount according 
to GiimbePs analysis being about 1 part in 1000. Secondary 
products, such as glauconite, phosphatic concretions and man- 
ganese nodules, occur though less frequently than in the hemi- 
pelagic sediments. Globigerina ooze is the characteristic deposit 
of the Atlantic Ocean, where it covers not less than 44,000,000 
sq. km. (17,000,000 sq. statute m.). In the Indian Ocean the 
area covered is 31,000,000 sq. km. (12,000,000 sq. m.) and in 
the huge Pacific Ocean only 30,000,000 sq. km. (11,500,000 
sq. m.). 

Pteropod ooze is merely a local variety of globigerina ooze 
in which the comparatively large but very delicate spindle- 
shaped shells of pteropods happen to abound. These shells 
do not retain their individuality at depths greater than 1400 
or 1500 fathoms, and in fact pteropod ooze is only found in 
small patches on the ridges near the Azores, Antilles, Canaries, 
Sokotra, Nicobar, Fiji and the Paumotu islands, and on the 
central rise of the South Atlantic between Ascension and Tristan 
d'Acunha. 

Diatom ooze was recognized by Sir John Murray as 'the 
characteristic deposit in high latitudes in the Indian Ocean, 
and later it was found to be characteristic also of the correspond- 
ing parts of the Indian and Pacific covering a total area of about 
22,000,000 sq. km. (8,500,000 sq. m.). It has been found spor- 
adically near the Aleutian Islands, between the Philippines and 
Marianne Islands and to the south of the Galapagos group. 
It is made up to a large extent of the siliceous frustules of diatoms. 
It is usually yellowish-grey and often straw-coloured when wet, 
though when dried it becomes white and mealy. 

Red clay was discovered and named by Sir Wyville Thomson 
on the " Challenger " in 1873 when sounding in depths of 2700 
fathoms on the way from the Canary Islands to St Thomas. 
The reddish colour comes from the presence of oxides of iron, 
and particles of manganese also occur in it, especially in the 
Pacific region, where the colour is more that of chocolate; but 
when it is mixed with globigerina ooze it is grey. Red clay is 
the deposit peculiar to the abysmal area; 70 carefully investi- 
gated samples collected by the " Challenger " came from an 
average depth of 2730 fathoms, 97 specimens collected by 
the " Tuscarora " came from an average depth of 2860 fathoms, 
and 26 samples obtained by the " Albatross " in the Central 
Pacific came from an average depth of 2620 fathoms. Red 
clay has not yet been found in depths less than 2200 fathoms. 
The main ingredient of the deposit is a stiff clay which is plastic 
when fresh, but dries to a stony hardness. Isolated gritty 
fragments of minerals may be felt in the generally fine-grained 
homogeneous mass. The dredge often brings up large numbers 
of nodules formed upon sharks' teeth, the ear-bones of whales 
or turtles or small fragments of pumice or other volcanic ejecta> 
and all more or less incrusted with manganese oxide until the 
nodules vary in size from that of a potato to that of a man's 
head. A very interesting feature is the small proportion of 
calcium carbonate, the amount present being usually less as the 
depth is greater; red clay from depths exceeding 3000 fathoms 
does not contain so much as 1 % of calcareous matter. 

■Murray and Renard recognize the progressive diminution of 
carbonate of lime with increase of depth as a characteristic of 
all eupelagic deposits. The whole collection of 231 specimens 
of deep-sea deposits brought back by the " Challenger " shows 
the following general relationship: — 

Proportion of Calcium Carbonate in Deep-Sea Deposits. 

68 samples from less than 2000 fathoms — 60-80 % 
68 „ „ 2000-2500 „ 46-7 % 
65 „ „ 2500-3000 „ 17-4 % 
8 „ „ more than 3000 „ 0-9 % 

In deep water there is a regular process of solution of the 
calcareous shells falling from the surface. Murray and Renard 
ascribe this to the greater abundance of carbonic acid in the 
deeper water, which aided by the increased pressure adds to 
the solvent pfower of the water for carbonate of lime. It is, 
however, a curious question how, considering the increase of 
carbonic acid by the decomposition of organic bodies and 
possible submarine exhalations of volcanic origin, the water 
has not in some places become saturated and a precipitate of 
amorphous calcium carbonate formed in the deepest water. 
The whole subject still requires investigation. 

Amongst the foreign material found embedded in the red 
clay are globules of meteoric iron, which are sometimes very 
abundant. Derived products in the form of crystals of phillipsite 
are not uncommon, but the most abundant of all are the in- 
crustations of manganese oxide, as to the origin of which Murray 
and Renard are not fully clear. The manganese nodules afford 
the most ample proof of the prodigious period of time which 
has elapsed since the formation of the red clay began; the 
sharks 7 teeth and whales' ear-bones which serve as nuclei belong 
in some cases to extinct species or even to forms derived from 
those familiar in the fossils from the seas of the Tertiary period. 
This fact, together with the extraordinarily rare occurrence 
of such remains and meteoric particles in globigerina ooze, 
although there is no reason to suppose that at any one time 
they are unequally distributed over the ocean floor, can only 
be explained on the assumption that the rate of formation of 
the epilophic deposits through the accumulation of pelagic 
shells falling from the surface is rapid enough to bury the slow- 
gathering material which remains uncovered on the spaces where 
the red clay is forming at an almost infinitely slower rate. Sir 
John Murray believes that no more than a few feet of red clay 
have accumulated in the deepest depressions since the close 
of the Tertiary period. The red clay is the characteristic deposit 
of the Pacific Ocean, where about 101,000,000 sq. km. (39,000,000 
sq. m.) are covered with it, while only 15,000,000 sq. km. 
(5,800,000 sq. m.) of the Indian Ocean and 14,000,000 sq. km. 
(5,400,000 sq. m.) of the Atlantic are occupied by this deposit; 
it is indeed the dominant submarine deposit of the water- 
hemisphere just as globigerina ooze is the dominant submarine 
deposit of the land-hemisphere. 

Radiolarian ooze was recognized as a distinct deposit and 
named by Sir John Murray on the "Challenger" expedition, 
but it may be viewed as red clay with an exceptionally large 
proportion of siliceous organic remains, especially those of the 
radiolarians which form part of the pelagic plankton. It does 
not occur in the Atlantic Ocean at all, and in the Indian Ocean 
it is only known round Cocos and Christmas Islands; but 
it is abundant in the Pacific, where it covers a large area between 
5° and 15 N., westward from the coast of Central America 
to 165 W., and it is also found in patches north of the Samoa 
Islands, in the Marianne Trench and west of the Galapagos 
Islands.

to the latest measurements of Kriimmel are as follows: —

Geologists are agreed that littoral and hemipelagic deposits 
similar to those now forming are to be found in all geological 
systems, but the existence in the rocks of eupelagic deposits 
and especially of the abysmal red clay, though viewed by some 
as probable, is totally denied by others. There is even some 
hesitation in accepting the continuity of the chalk with the globi- 
gerina ooze of the modern ocean. From the obvious rarity of 
true abysmal rocks in the continental area Sir John Murray 
deduces the permanence of the oceans, which he holds have 
always remained upon those portions of the earth's crust which 
they occupy now, and both J. Dana and Louis Agassiz had 
already arrived at the same conclusion. This theory accords 
well with the enormous lapse of time required in the accumulation 
of the red clay. 

Salts of Sea-water. — Sea-water differs from fresh water by- 
its salt and bitter taste and by its unsuitabib'ty for the purposes 
of washing and cooking. The process of natural evaporation 
in the salines or salt gardens of the margin of warm seas made 
the composition of sea-salt familiar at a very early time, and 
common salt, Epsom salts, gypsum and magnesium chloride 
were recognized amongst its constituents. The analyses of 
modern chemists have now revealed the existence of 32 out of 
the 80 known elements as existing dissolved in sea-water, and 
it is scarcely too much to say that the remaining elements also 
exist in minute traces which the available methods of analysis 
as yet fail to disclose. Many of the elements such as copper, 
lead, zinc, nickel, cobalt and manganese have only been found 
in the substance of sea-weeds and corals. Silver and gold also 
exist in solution in sea-water. Malaguti and Durocher l 
estimate the silver in sea-water as r part in 100,000,000 or 1 
grain in 1430 gallons. If this estimate is correct there exists 
dissolved in the ocean a quantity of silverequal to 13,300 million 
metric tons, that is to say 46,700 times as much silver as has been 
produced from all the mines in the world from the discovery 
of America down to 1902. No quantitative determination of 
the amount of gold in solution is available. E. Sonnstadt 2 
detected gold by means of a colour test and roughly estimated 
the amount as 1 grain per ton of sea-water, and on this estimate 
all the projects for extracting gold from sea-water have been 
based. 

The elements in addition to oxygen which exist in largest 
amount in sea salt are chlorine, bromine, sulphur, potassium, 
sodium, calcium and magnesium. Since the earliest quantitative 
analyses of sea-water were made by Lavoisier in 1772, Bergman 
in 1774, Vogel in 1813 and Marcet in 1819 the view has been held 
that the salts are present in sea-water in the form in which they 
are deposited when the water is evaporated. The most numerous 
analyses have been carried out by Forchhammer, who dealt 
with 150 samples, and Dittmar, who made complete analyses 
2of 7 7 samples obtained on the " Challenger " expedition. Dittmar 
showed that the average proportion of the salts in ocean water 
of 35 parts salts per thousand was as follows (calculated as parts 
per thousand of the sea-water, as percentage of the total salts 
and per hundred molecules of magnesium bromide) : —

As Marcet had foreshadowed from the analysis of 14 samples 
in 1819, the larger series of exact analyses proved that the varia- 
tions in the proportion of individual salts to the total salts 
are very small, and all analyses since Dittmar's have confirmed 
this result. Although the salts have been grouped in the above 

[1] Comptes rendus, Acad. Sciences (Paris, 1859), 49, 463, 536.

P- 159- 

table it is not to be supposed that a dilute solution like sea-water 
contains all the ingredients thus arbitrarily combined. There 
must be considerable dissociation of molecules, and as a first 
approximation it may be taken that of 10 molecules of most of 
the components about 9 (or in the case of magnesium sulphate 5) 
have been separated into their ions, and that it is only during 
slow concentration as in a natural saline that the ions combine 
to produce the various salts in the proportions set out in the above 
table. One can look on sea-water as a mixture of very dilute 
solutions of particular salts, each one of which after the lapse 
of sufficient time fills the whole space as if the other constituents 
did not exist, and this interdiffusion accounts easily for the 
uniformity of composition in the sea-water throughout the 
whole ocean, the only appreciable difference from point to point 
being the salinity or degree of concentration of the mixed 
solutions. 

The origin of the salt of the sea is attributed by some modern 
authorities entirely to the washing out of salts from the land by 
rain and rivers and the gradual concentration by evaporation 
in the oceans, and some (e.g. J. Joly) go so far as to base a calcula- 
tion of the age of the earth on the assumption that the ocean 
was originally filled with fresh water. This hypothesis, however, 
does not accord with the theory of the development of the earth 
from the state of a sphere of molten rock surrounded by an 
atmosphere of gaseous metals by which the first-formed clouds 
of aqueous vapour must have been absorbed. The great similarity 
between the salts of the ocean and the gaseous products of 
volcanic eruptions at the present time, rich in chlorides and 
sulphates of all kinds, is a strong argument for the ocean having 
been salt from the beginning. Two other facts are totally opposed 
to the origin of all the salinity of the oceans from the concentra- 
tion of the washings of the land. The proportions of the salts 
of river and sea- water are quite different, as Julius Roth shows 
thus: —

The salts of salt lakes which have been formed in the areas 
of internal drainage in the hearts of the continents by the 
evaporation of river water are entirely different in composition 
from those of the sea, as the existence of the numerous natron 
and bitter lakes shows. Magnesium sulphate amounts to 4*7% 
of the total salts of sea-water according to Dittmar, but to 23-6 % 
of the salts of the Caspian according to Lebedinzeff; in the 
ocean magnesium chloride amounts to 10*9% of the total salts, 
in the Caspian only to 4-5%; on the other hand calcium 
sulphate in the ocean amounts to 3*6%, in the Caspian to 6-9%. 
This disparity makes it extremely difficult to view ocean water 
as merely a watery extract of the salts existing in the rocks 
of the land. 

The determination of salinity was formerly carried out by 
evaporating a weighed quantity of sea-water to dryness and 
weighing the residue. Forchhammer, however, pointed out that 
this method gave inexact and variable results, as in the act 
of evaporating to dryness hydrochloric acid is given off as the 
temperature is raised to expel the last of the water, and Tornoe 
found that carbonic acid was also liberated and that the loss 
of both acids was very variable. Tornoe vainly attempted to 
apply a correction for this loss by calculation; and subsequently 
S. P. L. Sorensen and Martin Knudsen after a careful investiga- 
tion decided to abandon the old definition of salinity as the 
sum of all the dissolved solids in sea-water and to substitute for 
it the weight of the dissolved solids in 1000 parts by weight 
of sea-water on the assumption that all the bromine is replaced 
by its equivalent of chlorine, all the carbonate converted into 
oxide and the organic matter burnt. The advantage of the new 
definition lies in the fact that the estimation of the chlorine (or 
rather of the total halogen expressed as chlorine) is sufficient 
to determine the salinity by a very simple operation. According 
to Knudsen the salinity is given in weight per thousand parts 
by the expression S =0*030+1-8050 CI where S is the salinity 
and CI the amount of total halogen in a sample. Such a simple 
formula is only possible because the salts of sea- water are of 
such uniform composition throughout the whole ocean that the 
chlorine bears a constant ratio to the total salinity as newly 
defined whatever the degree of concentration. This definition 
was adopted by the International Council for the Study of the 
Sea in 1902, and it has since been very widely accepted. 

Besides the determination of salinity by titration of the 
chlorides, the method of determination by the specific gravity 
of the sea-water is still often used. In the laboratory the specific 
gravity is determined in a pyknometer by actual weighing, 
and on board ship by the use of an areometer or hydrometer. 
Three types of areometer are in use: (1) the ordinary hydrometer 
of invariable weight with a direct reading scale, a set of from 
five to ten being necessary to cover the range of specific gravity 
from i-ooo to 1*031 so as to take account of sea- water of all 
possible salinities; (2) the " Challenger " type of areometer 
designed by J. Y. Buchanan, which has an arbitrary scale and 
can be varied in weight by placing small metal rings on the stem 
so as to depress the scale to any desired depth in sea-water of 
any salinity, the specific gravity being calculated for each reading 
by dividing the total weight by the immersed volume; (3) the 
total immersion areometer, which has no scale and the weight 
of which can be adjusted so that the instrument can be brought 
so exactly to the specific gravity of the water sample that it 
remains immersed, neither floating nor sinking; this has the 
advantage of eliminating the effects of surface tension and in 
Fridtjof Nansen's pattern is capable of great precision. 

In all areometer work it is necessary to ascertain the tempera- 
ture of the water sample under examination with great exactness, 
as the volume of the areometer as well as the specific gravity of 
the water varies with temperature. All determinations must 
accordingly be reduced to a standard temperature for comparison. 
Following the practice of J. Y. Buchanan on the " Challenger " 
it has been usual for British investigators to calculate specific 
gravities for sea- water at 6o° F. compared with pure water at 
the maximum density point (39-2°) as unity. On the continent 
of Europe it has been more usual to take both at 17*5° C. (63 '5° 
F.), which is expressed as " Sj-J-'f ", but for pyknometer work 
in all countries where the sample is cooled to 32 F. before 
weighing and pure water at 39*2° taken as unity the expression 
is (o°/4°). On the authority of the first meeting of the Inter- 
national Conference for the Study of the Northern European 
Seas at Stockholm in 1899 Martin Knudsen, assisted by Karl 
Forch and S. P. L. Sorensen, carried out a careful investigation 
of the relation between the amount of chlorine, the total salinity 
and the specific gravity of sea-water of different strengths 
including an entirely new determination of the thermal expansion 
of sea-water. The results are published in his Hydrographkal 
Tables in a convenient form for use. 

The relations between the various conditions are set forth in 
the following equations where ao signifies the specific gravity of the 
sea -water in question at o° C, the standard at 4 being taken as 
1000, S the salinity and CI the chlorine, both expressed in parts by 
weight per mille. 

	(1) ao = -0-0934-0-8149 8-0-000482 S 2 +0-0000068 S*

	(3) S- 0-030 + 1-8050 CI. 

The temperature of maximum density of sea-water of any specific 
gravity was found by Knudsen to be given with sufficient accuracy 
for all practical purposes by the formula 6 =3*95 -0-2660-0, where $ 
is the temperature of maximum density in degrees centigrade. 
The temperature of maximum density is lower as the concentration 
of the sea-water is greater, as is shown in the following table: —

Further Physical Properties of Sea-water. — The laws of physical 
chemistry relating to complex dilute solutions apply to sea- 
water, and hence there is a definite relation between the osmotic 
pressure, freezing-point, vapour tension and boiling-point by 
which when one of these constants is given the others can be 
calculated. 

The most easily observed is the freezing-point, and according to 
the very careful determinations of H. T. Hansen the freezing-point 
r° C. varies with the degree of concentration according to the formula 

	r=— o-oo86— o*oo^4633(to— o-oooio55(r 2 . 

According to the investigations of Svante Arrhenius the osmotic 
pressure in atmospheres may be obtained by simply multiplying the 
temp rature of freezing (r) by the factor -12 -08, and it varies with 
temperature (/) according to the law which holds good for gaseous 
pressure. 

	P ( = Po(i +0-00367/) 

and can thus be reduced to its value at o° C. Sigurd Stenius has 
calculated tables of osmotic pressure for sea-water of different degrees 
of concentration. The relation of the elevation of the boiling-point 
(i°) to the osmotic pressure (P) is very simply derived from the 
formula t=o-02^o7Fo, while the reduction of vapour _ pressure 
proportional to the concentration can be very easily obtained from 
the elevation of the boiling-point, or it may be obtained directly 
from tables of vapour tension. -•**''

The importance of the osmotic pressure of sea-water in biology 
will be easily understood from the fact that a frog placed in 
sea- water loses water by exosmosis and soon becomes 20% 
lighter than its original weight, while a true salt-water fish 
suddenly transferred to fresh water gains water by endosmosis, 
swells up and quickly succumbs. The elevation of the boiling- 
point is of little practical importance, but the reduction of 
vapour pressure means that sea-water evaporates more slowly 
than fresh water, and the more slowly the higher the salinity. 
Unfortunately no observations of evaporation from the surface 
of the open sea have been made and very few comparisons of 
the evaporation of salt and fresh water are on record. The 
fact that sea-water does evaporate more slowly than fresh water 
has been proved by the observations of Mazelle at Triest and 
of Okado in Azino (Japan). Their experiments show that in 
similar conditions the evaporation of sea-water amounts to 
from 70 to 91 % of the evaporation of fresh water, a fact of some 
importance in geophysics on account of the vast expanses of 
ocean the evaporation from which determines the rainfall and 
to a large extent the heat-transference in the atmosphere. 

The optical properties of sea-water are of immediate import- 
ance in biology, as they affect the penetration of sunlight into 
the depths. The refraction of light passing through sea-water 
is dependent on the salinity to the extent that the index of 
refraction is greater as the salinity increases. From isolated 
observations of J. Soret and E. Sarasin and longer series of 
experiments by Tornoe and Krummel this relation is shown 
to be so close that the salinity of a sample can be ascertained by 
determining the index of refraction. According to Krummel 
the following relations hold good at 18 C. for the monochro- 
matic light of the D line of the sodium spectrum in units of the 
fifth decimal place.

The refractometer constructed by C. Pulfrich (of the firm of 
Zeiss, in Jena) has been successfully used by G. Schott and 
E. von Drygalski for the measurement of salinity at sea, and 
was found to have the same degree of accuracy as an areometer 
with the great advantage of being quite unaffected by the 
motion of the ship in a sea-way. 

The transparency of sea-water has frequently been measured 
at sea by the simple expedient of sinking white-painted disks 
and noting the depth at which they become invisible as the 
measure of the transparency of the water. For the north 
European seas disks of about 18 or 20 in. in diameter are sufficient 
for this purpose, but in the tropics, where the transparency is 
much greater, disks 3 ft. in diameter at least must be used or 
the angle of vision for the reflected light is too small. In shallow 
seas the transparency is always reduced in rough weather. In 
the North Sea north of the Dogger Bank, for instance, the disk 
is visible in calm weather to a depth of from 10 to 16 fathoms, 
but in rough weather only to 6J fathoms. Knipovitch occasion- 
ally observed great transparency in the cold waters of the 
Murman Sea, where he could see the disk in as much as 25 
fathoms, and a similar phenomenon has often been reported 
from Icelandic waters. The greatest transparency hitherto 
'reported -is in the eastern basin of the Mediterranean, where 
J. Luksch found the disk visible as a rule to from 22 to 27 
fathoms, and off the Syrian coast even to 33 fathoms. In the 
open Atlantic there are great differences in transparency; 
Krummel observed a 6 ft. disk to depths of 31 and 36 fathoms 
in the Sargasso Sea, but in the cold currents of the north and 
also in the equatorial current the depth of visibility was only 
from 11 to i6| fathoms. In the tropical parts of the Indian 
and the Pacific Oceans the depth of visibility increases again 
to from 20 to 27 fathoms. Some allowance should be made 
for the elevation of the sun at the time of observation. Mill 
has shown that in the North Sea off the Firth of Forth 
the average depth of visibility of a disk in the winter 
half-year was 4? fathoms and in the summer half-year 
6\ fathoms, and, although the greater frequency of rough 
weather in winter might tend to obscure the effect, in- 
dividual observations made it plain that the angle of the sun 
was the main factor in increasing the depth to which the disk 
remained visible. 

There are some observations on the transparency of sea-water 
of an entirely different character. Such, for instance, were 
those of Spindler and Wrangell in the Black Sea by sinking 
an electric lamp, those of Paul Regnard by measuring the 
change of electric resistance in a selenium cell or the chemical 
action of the light on a mixture of chlorine and hydrogen, by 
which he found a very rapid diminution in the intensity of 
light even in the surface layers of water. Many experiments 
have also been made by the use of photographic plates in order 
to find the greatest depth to which light penetrates. Fol and 
Sarasin detected the last traces of sunlight in the western 
Mediterranean at a depth of 254 to 260 fathoms, and Luksch 
in the eastern Mediterranean at 328 fathoms and in the Red 
Sea at 273 fathoms. The chief cause of the different depths 
to which light penetrates in sea-water is the varying turbidity 
due to the presence of mineral particles in suspension or to 
plankton. Schott gives the following as the result of measure- 
ments of transparency by means of a white disk at 23 stations 
in the open ocean, where quantitative observations of the 
plankton under 1 square metre of surface were made at the 
same time.

Any influence on transparency which may be exercised 
by the temperature or salinity of the water is quite in- 
significant. 

The colour of ocean water far from land is an almost pure 
blue, and all the variations of tint towards green are the result 
of local disturbances, the usual cause being turbidity of some 
kind, and this in the high seas is almost always due to swarms 
of plankton. The colour of sea-water as it is seen on board 
ship is most readily determined by comparison with the tints 
of ForePs xanthometer or colour scale, which consists of a series 
of glass tubes fixed like the rungs of a ladder in a frame and 
rilled with a mixture of blue and yellow liquids in varying 
proportions. For this purpose the zero or pure blue is repre- 
sented by a solution of 1 part of copper sulphate and 9 parts 
of ammonia in 190 parts of water. The yellow solution is made 
up of 1 part of neutral potassium chromate in 199 parts of 
water, and to give the various degrees of the scale, 1, 2, 3, 4, 
&c.,% of the yellow solution is mixed with 99, 98, 97, 96, &c.,% 
of the blue in successive tubes. Observations with the xantho- 
meter have not hitherto been numerous, but it appears that 
the purest blue (0-1 on Forel's scale) is found in the Sargasso 
Sea, in the North Atlantic and in similarly situated tropical 
or subtropical regions in the Indian and Pacific Oceans. The 
northern seas have an increasing tendency towards green, the 
Irminger Sea showing 5-9 Forel, while in the North Sea the* 
water is usually a pure green (10-14 Forel), the western Medi- 
terranean shows 5-9 Forel, but the eastern is as blue as the open 
ocean (0-2 Forel). A pure blue colour has been observed in 
the cold southern region, where the " Valdivia " found 0-2 Forel 
in 55 S. between io° and 31 E., and even the water of the 
North Sea has been observed at times to be intensely blue. 
The blue of the sea-water as observed by the Forel scale has 
of course nothing to do with the blue appearance of any distant 
water surface due to the reflection of a cloudless sky. Over 
shallows even the water of the tropical oceans is always green. 
There is a distinct relationship between colour and transparency 
in the ocean; the most transparent water which is the most 
free from plankton is always the purest blue, while an increasing 
turbidity is usually associated with an increasing tint of green. 
The natural colour of pure sea- water is blue, and this is em- 
phasized in deep and very clear water, which appears almost 
black to the eye. When a quantity of a fine white powder is 
thrown in, the light reflected by the white particles as they 
sink assumes an intense blue colour, and the experiments of 
J. Aitken with clear sea-water in long tubes leave no doubt 
on the subject. 

Discoloration of the water is often observed at sea, but that is 
always due to foreign substances. Brown or even blood-red 
stripes have been observed in the North Atlantic when swarms 
of the copepod Calanus finmarchicus were present; the brown alga 
Trichodesmium erythraeum, as its name suggests, can change the 
blue of the tropical seas to red; swarms of diatoms may produce 
olive -green patches in the ocean, while some other forms of 
minute life have at times been observed to give the colour of 
milk to large stretches of the ocean surface. 

On account of its salinity, sea-water has a smaller capacity 
for heat than pure water. According to Thoulet and Chevallier 
the specific heat diminishes as salinity increases, so that for 
10 per mille salinity it is 0*968, for 35 permille it is only 0-932, 
that of pure water being taken as unity. The thermal con- 
ductivity also diminishes as salinity increases, the conductivity 
for heat of sea-water of 35 per mille salinity being 4-2% less 
than that of pure water. This means that sea-water heats and 
cools somewhat more readily than pure water. The surface 
tension, on the other hand, is greater than that of pure water 
and increases with the salinity, according to Kriimmel, in the 
manner shown by the equation a= 77*09+0*0221 S at o° C, 
where a is the coefficient of surface tension and S the salinity in 
parts per thousand. The internal friction or viscosity of sea- 
water has also been shown by E. Ruppin to increase with the 
salinity. Thus at o° C. the viscosity of sea- water of 35 per mille 
salinity is 5-2% greater and at 25 C. 4% greater than that of 
pure water at the same temperatures; in absolute units the 
viscosity of sea-water at 25° C. is only half as great as it is at 
o° C. 

The compressibility of sea-water is not yet fully investigated. 
It varies not only to a marked degree with temperature, but also 
with the degree of pressure. Thus J. Y. Buchanan found a 
mean of 20 experiments made by piezometers sunk in great 
depths on board the " Challenger " give a coefficient of com- 
pressibility k= 491 Xio~ 7 ; but six of these experiments made at 
depths of from 2740 to 3125 fathoms gave k=48oXio~ 7 . The 
value usually adopted is k=45oXio~ 7 . The compressibility 
is in itself very small, but so great in its effect on the density 
of deep water in situ that the specific gravity (o°/4°) at 2000 
fathoms increases by 0-017 and at 3000 fathoms by 0*026. 
In other words, water which has a specific gravity of 1*0280 at, 
the surface would at the same temperature have a specific 
gravity of 1*0450 at 2000 and 1*0540 at 3000 fathoms. If the 
whole mass. of water in the ocean were relieved from pressure its 
volume would expand from 319 million cub. m. to 321*7 million 
cub. m., which for a surface of 139-5 million sq. m. means an 
increased depth of 100 ft. The rate of propagation of sound 
depends on the compressibility, and in ocean water at the tropical 
temperature of 77 F. the speed is 1482*6 metres (4860 ft.) per 
second, in Baltic water of 8 per mille salinity and a temperature 
ijJJ/rfyF. it is 1448-5 metres (4750 ft.) per second, that is to say, 
4^ times greater than the velocity of sound in air. This accounts 
for the great range of submarine sound signals, which can thus 
be very serviceable to navigation in foggy weather. 

The electrical conductivity of sea-water increases with the 
salinity; at 59 F. it is given according to E. Ruppin's formula 
as L= 0-001465 S— 0*00000978 S 2 +o*ooooooo876 S 3 in reciprocal 
ohms. 

The radio-activity of sea-water is extraordinarily small; in- 
deed in samples taken from 50 fathoms in the Bay of Danzig 
it was imperceptible, and R. T. Strutt found that salt from 
evaporated sea-water did not contain one-third of the 
quantity of radium present in the water of the town supply in 
Cambridge. 

Dissolved Gases of Sea-water. — The water of the ocean, like 
any other liquid, absorbs a certain amount of the gases with 
which it is in contact, and thus sea-water contains dissolved 
oxygen, nitrogen and carbonic acid absorbed from the atmo- 
sphere. As Gay-Lussac and Humboldt showed in 1805, gases 
are absorbed in less amount by a saline solution than by pure 
water. The first useful determinations of the dissolved gases 
of sea- water were made by Oskar Jacobsen in 1872. Since that 
time much work has been done, and the methods have been 
greatly improved. In the method now most generally practised, 
which was put forward by O. Pettersson in 1894, two portions of 
sea-water are collected in glass tubes which have been exhausted 
of air, coated internally with mercuric chloride to prevent the 
putrefaction of any organisms, and sealed up beforehand. The 
exhausted tube, when inserted in the water sample and the tip 
broken off, immediately fills, and is then sealed up so that the 
contents cannot change after collection. One portion is used 
for determining the oxygen and nitrogen, the other for the 
carbonic acid. The former determination is made by driving 
out the dissolved gases from solution and collecting them in a 
Torricellian vacuum, where the volume is measured after the 
carbonic acid has been removed. The oxygen is then absorbed 
by some appropriate means, and the volume of the nitrogen 
measured directly, that of the oxygen being given by difference. 
In the second portion the carbonic acid is driven out by means 
of a current of hydrogen, collected over mercury and absorbed 
by caustic potash. 

C. T. T. Fox, of the Central Laboratory of the International 
Council at Christiania, has investigated the relation of the atmospheric 
gases to sea-water by very exact experimental methods and arrived 
at the following expressions for the absorption of oxygen and nitrogen 
by sea- water of different degrees of concentration. The formulae 
show the number of cubic centimetres of gas absorbed by 1 litre of 
sea-water; / indicates the temperature in degrees centigrade and CI 
the salinity as shown by the amount of chlorine per mille: — 

02 = 10*291-0*2809 / +0*006009 ^0*0000632 /*- 
0(0*1161-0*003922 /* +0-000063 / s )

0(0*2149-0*007117 ^+0-0000931 Z 1 ) 

In the case of ocean water with a salinity of 35 per mille, this gives 
for saturation with atmospheric gases in cc. per litre: —

The reduction of the absorption of gas by rise of temperature 
is thus seen to be considerable. As a rule the amount of both 
gases dissolved in sea-water is found to be that which is indicated 
by the temperature of the water in situ. Jacobsen on some 
occasions found water in the surface layers of the Baltic super- 
saturated with oxygen, which he ascribed to the action of the 
chlorophyll in vegetable plankton; in other cases when examin- 
ing the nearly stagnant water from deep basins he found a 
deficiency of oxygen due no doubt to the withdrawal of oxygen 
from solution, by the respiration of the animals and by the 
oxidation of the deposits on the bottom. When these processes 
continue for a long time in deep water shut off from free circula- 
tion so that it does not become aerated by contact with the 
atmosphere the water becomes unfit to support the life of fishes, 
and when the accumulation of putrefying organic matter gives 
rise to sulphuretted hydrogen as in the Black Sea below 125 
fathoms, life, other than bacterial, is impossible. The water 
from the greatest depths of the Black Sea, 1160 fathoms, 
contains 6 cc. of sulphuretted hydrogen per litre. 

The distribution of dissolved oxygen in the depths of the 
open ocean is still very imperfectly known. Dittmar's analysis 
of the "Challenger" samples indicated an excess of oxygen in 
the surface water of high southern latitudes and a deficiency at 
depths below 50 fathoms. 

The facts regarding carbonic acid in sea-water are even less 
understood, for here we have to do not only with the solution of 
the gas but also with a chemical combination. On this account 
it is very difficult to know when all the gas is driven out of a 
sample of sea-water, and a much larger proportion is present than 
the partial pressure of the gas in the atmosphere and its co- 
efficient of absorption would indicate. These constants would 
lead one to expect to find 0-5 cc. per litre at o° C. while as a 
matter of fact the amount absorbed approaches 50 cc. The 
form of combination is unstable and apparently variable, so 
that the quantities of free carbonic acid, bicarbonate and 
normal carbonate are liable to alter. Since 1851 it has been 
known that all sea-water has an alkaline reaction, and Tornoe 
defined the alkalinity of sea-water as the amount of carbonic 
acid which is necessary to convert the excess of bases into normal 
carbonate. The alkalinity of North Atlantic water of 35 per 
mille salinity is 26-86 cc. per litre, corresponding to a total amount 
of carbonic acid of 49-07 cc. According to the researches of 
August Krogh, 1 the alkalinity is greatly increased by the ad- 
mixture of land water. This is proved by E. Ruppin's analysis 
of Baltic water, which has an alkalinity of 16 to 18 instead of 
the 5 or 6 which would be the amount proportional to the 
salinity, while the water of the Vistula and the Elbe with a 
salinity of o-i per mille has an alkalinity of 28 or more. Thus 
the alkalinity serves as an index of the admixture of river water 
with sea-water. Carbonic acid passes from the atmosphere 
into the ocean as soon as its tension in the latter is the smaller; 
hence in this respect the ocean acts as a regulator. The amount 
of carbonic acid in solution may also be increased by submarine 
exhalations in regions of volcanic disturbance, but it must be 
remembered that the critical pressure for this gas is 73 atmo- 
spheres, which is reached at a depth of 400 fathoms, so that 
carbonic acid produced at the bottom of the ocean must be in 
liquid form. The respiration of marine animals in the depths of 
deep basins in which there is no circulation adds to the carbonic 
acid at the expense of the dissolved oxygen. This is frequently 
the case in fjord basins; for instance, in the Gullmar Fjord at a 
depth of 50 fathoms with water of 34-14 per mille salinity and 

1 Meddclelstr om Grbnland (Copenhagen, 1904), p. 331. 

a temperature of 40-1° F., the carbonic acid amounts to 51-55 cc. 
per.litre, and the oxygen only to 2-19 cc. Vegetable plankton 
in sunlight can reverse this process, assimilating the carbon of 
the carbonic acid and restoring the oxygen to solution, as was 
proved by Martin Knudsen and Ostenfeld in the case of diatoms. 
Little is known as yet of the distribution of carbonic acid in the 
oceans, but the amount present seems to increase with the 
salinity as shown by the four observations quoted : — 

Water from 
Gulf of Finland of 3-2 per mille salinity = 17-2 cc. CO* at4-i°C. 
Western Baltic of 14-2 ,, „ =37*o „ at i-6°C. 
North Atlantic of 35-0 „ „ =49-0 „ at about 
Eastern Mediter- io°C. 
ranean of 39-0 „ „ =53'° »» at26-7°C. 

Unfortunately the very numerous determinations of carbonic 
acid made by J. Y. Buchanan on the " Challenger " were vitiated 
by the incompleteness of "the method employed, but they are 
none the less of value in showing clearly that the waters of the 
far south of the Indian Ocean are relatively rich in carbonic acid 
and the tropical areas deficient. 

Distribution of Salinity. — A great deal of material exists on 
which to base a study of the surface salinity of the oceans, and 
Schott's chart published in Petermanns Mitteilungen for 1902 
incorporates the earlier work and substantially confirms the first 
trustworthy chart of the kind compiled by J. Y. Buchanan from 
the " Challenger " observations. In each of the three oceans 
there are two maxima of salinity — one in the north, the other 
in the south tropical belt, separated by a zone of minimum 
salinity in the equatorial region, and giving place poleward to 
regions of still lower salinity. The three oceans differ somewhat 
between themselves. The North Atlantic maximum is the 
highest with water of 37-9 per mille salinity; the maximum 
in the South Atlantic is 37-6; in the North Indian Ocean, 
36-7; the South Indian Ocean, 36-4; the South Pacific, 36-9; 
and the North Pacific has the lowest maximum of all, only 
35-9. The comparatively fresh equatorial belt of water, has a 
salinity of 35-0 to 34-5 in the Atlantic, 35-0 to 34-0 in the Indian 
Ocean, 34-5 in the Western and 33-5 in the Eastern Pacific. 
Taking each of the oceans as a whole the Atlantic'has the highest 
general surface salinity with 35*37. 

The salinity of enclosed seas naturally varies much more than 
that of the open ocean. Thesaltest include the eastern Mediter- 
ranean with 39-5 per mille, the Red Sea with 41 to 43 per mille 
in the Gulf of Suez, and the Persian Gulf with 38. The fresher 
enclosed seas inciude the Malay and the East Asiatic fringing 
seas with 30 to 34-5 per mille, the Gulf of St Lawrence with 
30 to 31, the North Sea with ^5 north of the Dogger Bank 
diminishing to 32 further south, and the Baltic, which freshens 
rapidly from between 25 to 31 in the Skagerrak to 7 or 8 east- 
ward of Bornholm and to practically fresh water at the heads of 
the Gulfs of Bothnia and Finland. The Arctic Sea presents a 
great contrast between the salinity of the surface of the ice-free 
Norwegian Sea with 35 to 35-4 and that of the Central Polar 
Basin, which is dominated by river water and melted ice, and has 
a salinity less than 25 per mille in most parts. The average 
salinity of the whole surface of the oceans may be taken as 34-5 
per mUle. 

The vertical distribution of salinity has only recently been 
investigated systematically, as the earlier expeditions were not 
equipped with altogether trustworthy apparatus for collecting 
water samples at great depths. Two main types of water-bottle 
for collecting samples have been long in use. The older, devised 
by Hooke in 1667, is provided with valves above and below, both 
opening upward, through which the water passes freely during 
descent, but which are closed by some device on hauling up. 
The newer or slip water-bottle type consists of a cylinder allowed 
to drop on to a base-plate when a sample is to be collected. The 
first form of slip water-bottle due to Meyer retained the water 
merely by the weight of the cylinder pressing on the base-plate. 
J. Y. Buchanan introduced an improved form on the " Chal- 
lenger," also remaining closed by weight, the cylinder being very 
heavy and ground to fit the bevelled base-plate very accurately. 

H. R. Mill in 1885 devised a self-locking arrangement by which 
the bottle once closed was automatically locked and rendered 
watertight; H. L. Ekman made further improvements; and, 
finally, O. Pettersson and F. Nansen perfected the instrument, 
adapting it not only for enclosing a portion of water at any 
desired depth, but by a series of concentric divisions insulating 
in the central compartment water at the temperature it had at 
the moment of collection. By means of a weight dropped along 
the line the water-bottle can be shut and a sample enclosed at any 
desired depth. The use of a sliding weight is not recommended 
in depths much exceeding 200 fathoms on account of the time 
required and the risk of the line sagging at a low angle and so 
stopping the weight. In deep water the closing mechanism is 
usually actuated by a screw propeller which begins to work when 
the line is being hauled in and can be set so as to close the water- 
bottle in a very few fathoms. A small but heavy water-bottle 
has been devised by Martin Knudsen, provided with a pressure 
gauge or bathometer, by which samples may be collected from 
any moderate depth down to about 100 fathoms, on board a 
vessel going at full speed. This has made it possible to obtain 
many samples from moderate depths along a long line in a 
very short space of time. Sigsbee's small water-bottle on the 
double valve principle actuated by a propeller requires extremely 
skilful handling to enable it to give good results. 

As yet it is only possible to speak with confidence of the vertical 
distribution of salinity in the seas surrounding Europe, where 
there is a general increase of salinity with depth. For the open 
ocean the only quite trustworthy results are those obtained by 
the prince of Monaco in the North Atlantic, and by the recent 
Antarctic expeditions in the South Atlantic and South Indian 
Oceans. The observations made on the " Challenger " and 
( ■ Gazelle, " though enabling some perfectly sound general 
conclusions to be drawn, require to be supplemented. It appears, 
as J. Y. Buchanan pointed out in 1876, that the great con- 
trasts in surface salinity between the tropical maxima and 
the equatorial minima give place at the moderate depth of 
200 fathoms to a practically uniform salinity in all parts of the 
ocean. 

In the North Atlantic a strong submarine current flowing 
outward from the Mediterranean leaves the Strait of Gibraltar 
with a salinity of $8 per mille, and can be traced as far as Madeira 
and the Bay of Biscay in depths of from 600 to 2800 fathoms, 
still with a salinity of 35-6 per mille, whereas off the Azores at 
equal depths the salinity is from 0-5 to 0-7 per mille less. In the 
tropical and subtropical belts of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans 
south of the equator the salinity diminishes rapidly from tbe 
surface downwards, and at 500 fathoms reaches a minimum of 
34*3 or 34*4 P er mille; after that it increases again to 800 fathoms, 
where it is almost 34-7 or 34-8, and this salinity holds good to the 
bottom, even to the greatest depths, as was first shown by the 
" Gauss " and afterwards by the " Planet " between Durban and 
Ceylon. 

Our knowledge of the Pacific in this respect is still very im- 
perfect, hut it appears to be less salt than the other oceans at 
depths below 800 fathoms, as on the surface, the salinity at 
considerable depths being 34*6 to 34^7 in the western part of the 
ocean, and about 34-4 to 34-5 in the eastern, so that, although 
the data are by no means satisfactory, it is impossible to assign 
a mass-salinity of more than 34-7 per mille for the whole body of 
Pacific water. 

The causes of difference of salinity are mainly meteorological. 
The belt of equatorial minimum salinity corresponds with the 
excessively rainy belt of calms and of the equatorial counter- 
current, the salinity diminishing towards the east. The tropical 
maxima of salinity on the poleward side of the trade-winds 
coincide with the regions of minimum rainfall, high temperature, 
strong winds and consequently of maximum evaporation. 
Evaporation is naturally greatest in the enclosed seas of the nearly 
rainless subtropical zone such as the Mediterranean and Red Sea. 
Where the evaporation is at a minimum, the inflow of rivers from 
a large continental area and the precipitation from the atmo- 
sphere at a maximum, there is necessarily the greatest dilution 
of the sea-water, the Baltic and the Arctic Sea being conspicuous 
examples. 

Temperature of the Oceans. — There is no difficulty in observing 
the temperattire of the surface of the sea on board ship, the only 
precautions required being to draw the water in a bucket which 
has not been heated in the sun in summer or exposed to frost in ' 
winter, to draw it well forward of any discharge pipes of the 
steamer, to place it in the shade on deck, insert the thermometer 
immediately and make the reading without delay. The measure- 
ment of temperature in the depths, unless a high-speed water- 
bottle he used, involves stopping the ship and employing thermo- 
meters of special construction. Many forms have been tried, but 
only three types are in general use. The first is the slow-action 
thermometer which was originally used with good effect by 
de Saussure in the Mediterranean in 1780. He covered the bulb 
of the thermometer with layers of non-conducting material and 
left it immersed at the desired depth for a very long time to 
enable it to take the temperature of its surroundings. When 
hrought up again the thermometer retained its temperature so 
long that there was ample time to take a correct reading. Since 
1870 thermometers on this principle have been in use for regular 
observations at German coast and light-ship stations. Following 
the suggestion of Cavendish, Irving made observations of deep 
temperature on Phipps's Spitsbergen voyage of 1773 with a 
valved water-bottle, insulated by non-conducting material. A 
similar instrument gave excellent results in the hands of E. von 
Lenz on Kotzebue's second voyage of circumnavigation in 1823- 
1826. The last elaboration of the insulated slip water-bottle 
by Ekman, Nansen and Pettersson has produced an instrument 
of great perfection, in which the insulation is effected by layers 
of water between a series of concentric ebonite cylinders, all of 
which are closed both ahove and below when the apparatus 
encloses a sample, and each of which in turn must be warmed 
considerably before there is any rise of temperature in the 
chamher within. This can be used with certainty to -02° C. for 
water down to 250 fathoms, after taking account of the slight 
disturbance produced by the expansion of the greatly compressed 
deep water. 

The second form of deep-sea thermometer is the self -registering 
maximum and minimum on James Six's principle. These 
instruments must be constructed with the greatest care, but 
when well-made in accordance with J. Y. Buchanan's large 
model they can be trusted to give a good account of the vertical 
distribution of temperature, provided the water grows cooler 
as the depth increases. They would act equally well if the water 
grew continually warmer as the depth increases, but they cannot 
give an exact account of a temperature inversion such as is 
produced when layers of warmer and colder water alternate. 

The third form is the outflow or reversing thermometer, first 
introduced by Aim6, who used a very inconvenient form in the 
Mediterranean in 1 841-1845, hut greatly improved and simplified 
by Negretti and Zambra in 1875. The principle is to have a 
constriction in the tube above the bulb so proportioned that 
when the instrument is upright it acts in every way as an ordinary 
mercurial thermometer, but when it is inverted the thread of 
mercury breaks at the constriction, and the portion above the 
point runs down the now reversed tube and remains there as a 
measure of the temperature at the moment of turning over. 
For convenience in reading, the tube is graduated inverted, and 
when it is restored to its original position the mercury thread 
joins again and it acts as before. Various modifications of this 
form of thermometer have been made by Chabaud of Paris and 
others. It has the advantage over the thermometer on Six's 
principle that, being filled with mercury, it does not require such 
long immersion to take the temperature of the water. A cor- 
rection has, of course, to be made for the expansion or con- 
traction of the mercury thread if the temperature of reading 
differs much from that of reversing. Magnaghi introduced a 
convenient method of inverting the thermometer by means of 
a propeller actuated on beginning to heave in the line, and this 
form is used for all work at great depths. For shallow water 
greater precision and certainty are obtained by using a lever 
actuated by a weight slipped down the line to cause the reversal, 
as in the patterns of Rung, Mill and others. 

All thermometers sunk into deep water must be protected 
against the enormous pressure to which tbey are exposed. This 
may be done by the method suggested by Arago in 1828, intro- 
duced by Aime in 1841 and again suggested by Glaisher in 1858, 
of sealing up the whole instrument in a glass tube exhausted of 
air; or, less effectively, by surrounding the bulb alone with a 
strong outer sheath of glass. In both forms it is usual to have 
the space between the bulb and the protecting sheath partly 
filled with mercury or alcohol to act as a conductor and reduce 
the time necessary for the thermometer to acquire the tempera- 
ture of its surroundings. 

The warming of the ocean is due practically to solar radiation 
alone; such heat as may be received from the interior of the 
earth can only produce a small effect and is fairly uniformly 
distributed. On account of the high specific heat of sea-water 
the diurnal range of temperature at the surface is very small. 
According to A. Buchan's discussion of the two-hourly observa- 
tions on the " Challenger " the total range between the daily 
maximum and minimum in the warmer seas is between 0-7° 
and o-8° F., and for the colder seas still less (0-2° F.), compared 
with 3-2° F. in the overlying air. The maximum usually occurs 
between r and 2-30 p.m., the minimum shortly before sunrise. 
The temperature of the surface water is generally a little higher 
than that of the overlying air, the daily average difference being 
about o-6° F., varying from 0-9° lower at 1 p.m. to i*6° higher 
at 1 a.m. There are few observations available for ascertaining 
the depth to which warmth from the sun penetrates in the 
ocean. The investigations of Aim6 in 1845 and Hensen in 1889 
indicate that the amount of cloud has a great effect. Aime 
showed that on a calm bright day in the Mediterranean the 
temperature rose o-i° C. between the early morning and noon 
at a depth of about 12 fathoms. Luksch deduced a much 
greater penetration of solar warmth from the comparison of 
observations at different hours at neighbouring stations in the 
eastern Mediterranean, but his methods were not exact enough 
to give confidence in the result. The penetration of warmth 
from the surface is effected by direct radiation, and by con- 
vection by particles rendered dense by evaporation increasing 
salinity. Conduction has practically no effect, for the coefficient 
of thermal conductivity in sea-water is so small that if a mass 
of sea- water were cooled to o° C. and the surface kept at a 
temperature of 30 C, 6 months would elapse before a tempera- 
ture of 1 5 C. was reached at the depth of 1*3 metres, 1 year 
at 1*85 metres, and 10 years at 5-8 metres. Great irregular 
variations in radiation and convection sometimes produce a 
remarkably abrupt change of temperature at a certain depth in 
calm water; the layer in which this sudden change occurs has 
been termed the SprungschichL How closely two bodies of 
water at different temperatures may come together is shown 
by the fact that in the Baltic in August between 10 and 11 
fathoms there is sometimes a fall of temperature from 57 to 
46*5° F. Such a condition of things is only possible in very 
calm weather, the action of waves having the effect of mixing 
the water to a considerable depth. After a storm the whole of 
the water in the North Sea assumes a homothermic condition, 
i.e. the temperature is the same from surface to bottom, and this 
occurs not only south of the Dogger Bank, where the condition 
is normal, but also, though less frequently, in the deeper water 
farther north. Similar effects are produced in narrow waters 
by the action of tidal currents, and the influence of a steady wind 
blowing on- or off-shore has a powerful effect in mixing the 
water. 

The warmest parts of the Indian Ocean and Western Pacific 
have a mean annual temperature of 82 to 84 F., but such 
high temperatures are not found in the tropical Atlantic. In the 
Indian Ocean between 15 N. and 5 S. the surface temperature 
in May averages 84 to 86° F., and in the Bay of Bengal the 
temperature is 86°, and no part of the Atlantic has so high a 
monthly mean temperature at any season. G. Schott's inves- 
tigations show that the annual range of surface temperature 
in the open ocean is greatest in 40 N., with 18-4° F., and in 
30 S., with 9-2° F.; on the contrary, near the equator it is 
less, only 4 F. in io° N., and in high latitudes it is also small, 
5*2° F. in 50° S. The figures quoted above are differences 
between the average surface temperatures of the warmest and 
of the coldest month. As to the absolute extremes of surface 
temperature, Sir John Murray points out that 90 F. frequently 
occurs in the western part of the tropical Pacific, while among 
seas the Persian Gulf reaches 96 F., only 2 under blood-heat, 
and the Red Sea follows closely with a maximum of 94 . The 
greatest change of temperature at any place has been recorded 
to the east of Nova Scotia, a minimum of 28 F. and a maximum 
of 8o°, and to the north-east of Japan with a minimum of 27 F. 
and a maximum of &3 . In those localities, however, it is not 
the same water which varies in temperature with the season, 
but the water of different warm and cold currents which periodic- 
ally occupy the same locality as they advance and retreat. 
The zones of surface temperature are arranged roughly parallel 
to the equator, especially in the southern hemisphere. Between 
40 N. and 40 S. the currents produce a considerable rearrange- 
ment of this simple order, the belts of warm water being wider 
on the western sides of the oceans and narrower on the eastern. 

The arrangement of the isotherms thus affords a basis for 
valuable deductions as to the direction of ocean currents. The 
surface temperature of the Atlantic is relatively lower than that 
of the other oceans when the whole area is considered. According 
to KriimmePs calculation the proportional areas at a high 
temperature are as follows: — 

Percentage of Ocean Surface with Temperature. 
Atlantic.  Indian.  Pacific. 
Over 77 F. (25° C) . . . 
Over 68° F. (20 C) . . . 
22*4 
50-1 
38*0 
40*1 
58-4 

This disparity results in some degree at least from the com- 
parative narrowness of the inter-tropical Atlantic, and the 
absence of a cool northern area in the Indian Ocean. Kriimmel 
calculates that the mean temperature of the whole ocean surface 
is 63-3° F., while the mean sea-level temperature of the whole 
layer of air at the surface of the earth is given by Hann as 
57-8° F. 

We are still ignorant of the depth to which the annual tempera- 
ture wave penetrates in the open ocean, but observations in the 
Mediterranean enable us to form some opinion on the matter. 
The observations of Aime in 1845 and of Semmola in the Gulf of 
Naples in 1881 show that the surface water in winter cools 
until the whole mass of water from the surface to the bottom, 
in 1600 fathoms or more, assumes the same temperature. To- 
wards the end of summer the upper layers have been warmed to 
a depth which indicates how far the influence of solar radiation 
and convection have reached. Aime estimated this depth at 
1 50-200 fathoms, while the observations of the Austrian expe- 
dition in the eastern Mediterranean found it to be from 200 
to nearly 400 fathoms. In the Red Sea, where a similar seasonal 
change occurs, the depth to which the surface layer warms up 
is about 275 fathoms. The great difference in salinity between 
the surface and the deep water excludes the possibility of 
effective convection in the seas of northern Europe, and in the 
open ocean the currents which are felt everywhere, and especially 
those with a vertical component, must exercise a very disturbing 
influence on convection. 

The vertical distribution of temperature in the open ocean 
is much better known than that of salinity. The regional 
differences of temperature at like depths become less as the 
depth increases. Thus at 300 fathoms greater differences than 
9° F. hardly ever occur between 50 N. and 50 S., in 800 fathoms 
the differences are less than 5-5° and in 1500 fathoms less than 
2 . Even in the tropics the high temperature of the surface 
is confined to a very shallow layer; thus in the Central Pacific 
where the surface temperature is 82 F. the temperature at 100 
fathoms is only 52 F. The whole ocean must thus form but 
a cold dwelling-place for the organisms of the deep sea. Sir 
John Murray calculates that at least 80% of the water in the 
ocean has a temperature always less than 40 F., and a recent 
calculation by Kriimmel gave in fact a mean temperature of 
39° F. for the whole ocean.

[Fig. i. — Diagram illustrating Distribution of Sea Temperature. ]

The normal vertical distribution of temperature is illustrated 
in curve A of fig. 1, which represents a sounding in the South 
Atlantic; and this arrangement of a rapid fall of temperature 
giving place gradually to an extremely slow but steady diminu- 
tion as depth increases is termed anatkermic (ara, back, and 
depttfc, warm). Curve B shows the typical distribution of 
temperature in an enclosed sea, in this case the Sulu Basin of 
the Malay Sea, where from the level of the barrier to the bottom 
the temperature remains uniform or homothertnic. Curve C 
shows a typical summer condition in the polar seas, where 
layers of sea-water at different temperatures are superimposed, 
the arrangement from the surface to 200 fathoms is termed 
dichathermic (Stxa, apart), from iooo to 2000 fathoms it is termed 
katatkermic (Kara, down). In autumn the enclosed seas of high 
latitudes frequently present a thermal stratification in which 
a warm middle layer is sandwiched between a cold upper layer 
and a cold mass below, the arrangement being termed meso- 
thermic (jxkaos, middle). The nature of the change of 
temperature with depth below 2500 fathoms is entirely dependent 
on the position of the sub-oceanic elevations, for the rises and 
ridges act as true submarine watersheds. As the Arctic Basin 
is shut off from the North Atlantic by ridges rising to within 
300 fathoms of the surface and from the Pacific by the shallow 
shelf of the Bering Sea, and as the ice-laden East Greenland 
and Labrador currents consist of fresh surface water which 
cannot appreciably influence the underlying mass, the Arctic 
region has no practical effect upon the bottom temperature of 
the three great oceans, which is entirely dominated by the 
influence of the Antarctic. The existence of deep-lying and 
extensive rises or ridges in high southern latitudes has been 
indicated by the deep-sea temperature observations of Antarctic 
expeditions. Temperatures so low as 31*5° to 31*3° F. do not 
occur much beyond 50 S. The " Belgica " even found a tempera- 
ture of 33-1° F. in 6i° S., 63 W., at a depth of 2018 fathoms. 
The conditions of temperature in the South Atlantic are charac- 
teristic. South of 55 S. in approximately 3000 fathoms the 
bottom temperature is 31-1° F.; in the Cape Trough it is 32*7° 
in 45 S., and 33*8° to 34*3° in 35° S., while north of the Walfisch 
Ridge and east of the South Atlantic Rise bottom temperatures 
of 36 to 36-7° F. prevail right northwards across the equator 
into the Bay of Biscay, showinga steady rise of bottom tempera- 
ture as successive submarine elevations restrict communication 
with the Antarctic. On the other hand, in the more open Argen- 
tine Basin, which carries deep water far to the south, the bottom 
temperature in 40 S. is only from 32*2° to 32-7° F., and the same 
low temperature continues throughout the Brazil Basin to the 
equator; bift in the North American Basin from the West Indies 
to the Telegraph Plateau no satisfactory bottom temperature 
lower than 35*6° F. has been reported. On the floor of the 
Indian Ocean temperatures of 33*3° to 33-6° occur south of 
35° S. in depths of- 2700 fathoms or more, but north of 35 S. 
the prevailing bottom temperatures are from 34-0° to 34*3°. 
In similar depths in the Pacific south of the equator temperatures 
of 33*8 tf to 34*5° are found, and north of the equator bottom 
temperatures at the same depth increase to 35*1° in the neighbour- 
hood of the Aleutian Islands, again completely justifying the 
conclusion as to the Antarctic control of deep water temperature 
throughout the ocean. 

The marginal rises and continental shelves prevent this cold 
bottom water from penetrating into the depths of the enclosed 
and fringing seas. Thus in the Central American Sea below 
930 fathoms, the depth on the bar, no water is found at a tempera- 
ture lower than that prevailing in the open ocean at that depth, 
viz. 39-6° F., not even at the bottom of the great Bartlett Deep 
in 3439 fathoms. Such homothermic masses of water are 
characteristic of all deep enclosed seas. Thus in the Malay 
Sea the various minor seas or basins are homothermic below 
the depth of the rim, at the temperature prevailing at that depth 
in the open ocean: in the China Sea below 875 fathoms with 
36*5° F.; in the Sulu Sea (depth 2550 fathoms) below 400 fathoms 
with 50-5° F.; in the Celebes Sea below 820 fathoms with 38-6° 
F.; in the Banda Sea below 902 fathoms with 37*9° F. In other 
enclosed seas which are shut off from the ocean by a very shallow 
sill the rule holds good that the homothermic water below the 
level of the sill is at the lowest temperature reached by the 
surface water in the coldest season of the year, provided always 
that the stratification of salinity is such as to permit of convection 
being set up. To this group belongs the Arctic Sea; the 
Norwegian Sea is homothermic below 550 fathoms at 29-8° F., 
but this cold water does not penetrate into the Arctic Basin 
on account of the ridge between Spitsbergen and Greenland, 
and there the water below 1400 fathoms has a temperature of 
30-6° to 30-7° F. because the surface layers of water are too light, 
on account of the low salinity due to ice-melting, to enable 
even the cold of a polar winter to set up a downward convection 
current. The Mediterranean Sea also belongs to this group; 
its various deep basins are homothermic (at the winter surface 
temperature) below the level of their respective sills — the 
Balearic Basin below 190 fathoms at 55 F.; the Eastern Basin 
below 270 fathoms at 55-9° F; the Ionian Sea at 56*3° F.; and 
at 56*7° south of Cyprus. Similarly in the Red Sea the water 
below 380 fathoms is homothermic at 70*7° F. 

An under-current flows out from the Red Sea through the Strait 
of Bab-el-Mandeb, and from the Mediterranean through the Strait 
of Gibraltar, raising the salinity as well as the temperature of the 
part of the ocean outside the gates of the respective seas. The 
action of the Red Sea water affects the whole of the Gulf of 
Aden and Arabian Sea, raising the temperature at the depth of 
550 fathoms to 52 or 53 F. or 9 Fahrenheit degrees higher than 
the water of the Bay of Bengal at the same depth. The effect of 
the Mediterranean water in the North Atlantic does not require 
such large figures to express it, but is none the less extraordinarily 
far-reaching, as first indicated by the work of the " Challenger " 
and subsequently defined by H. N. Dickson's discussion of the 
observations of Wolfenden in the little sailing yacht " Silver 
Belle." The temperature at 550 fathoms is raised to 49° or 50 
F. between Madeira and the Biscay Shelf, i.e. 5-4° F. above the 
temperature at the same depth off the Azores. 

In shallow seas such as the North Sea and the British fringing 
seas, where tidal currents run strong, there is a general mixing 
together of the surface and deeper water, thus making the arrange- 
ment of vertical temperature anathermic in summer and kata- 
thermic in winter, while at the transitional periods in spring 
and autumn it is practically homothermic. Thus at Station 
E2 of the international series at the mouth of the English 
Channel in 40° 27' N., 4 42' W., the following distribution of 
temperature F. has been observed by Matthews: —

It is noticeable that there is a marked vertical temperature 
gradient only at the end of summer when a warm surface layer 
is formed, though in August 1904 that was only 8 fathoms 
thick. In small nearly land-locked basins shut off from one 
another by bars rising to within a short distance of the surface 
and affected both by strong tidal currents and by a considerable 
admixture of land water, the contrasts of vertical distribution 
of temperature with the seasons are strongly marked, and there 
are also great unperiodic changes effected mainly by wind, as 
is shown by the investigations of H. R. Mill in the Clyde Sea 
Area, and of O. Pettersson, J. Hjort and Helland-Hansen in the 
Scandinavian fjords. 

Sea Ice. — The freezing-point of sea-water is lower as the 
salinity increases and normal sea-water of 35 per mille salinity 
freezes at 28-6° F. Experience shows that sea-water can be 
cooled considerably below the freezing-point without freezing 
if there is no ice or snow in contact with it. Freezing takes 
place by the formation of pure ice in flat crystalline plates of 
the hexagonal system, which form in perpendicular planes 
and unite in bundles to form grains so that a thick covering 
of ice exhibits a fibrous structure. It is only the water that 
freezes; the dissolved salts are excluded in the process in a 
regular order according to temperature. At temperatures 
about 1 7 F. sodium sulphate is the first ingredient of the salts 
to separate out, potassium chloride follows at 12 F., sodium 
chloride at — 7*4° F., magnesium chloride at — 28-5° F., and, 
as O. Pettersson was the first to point out, calcium chloride 
not until — 67 F. During the rapid formation of ice the still 
unfrozen brine is often imprisoned between the little plates of 
frozen water; hence without some special treatment sea-ice is 
not suitable as a source of drinking water. After long con- 
tinued frost the last of the included brine may be frozen and 
the salts driven out in crystals on the surface; these crystals 
are known to polar explorers by the Siberian name of rassoL 
Ice is a very poor conductor of heat and accordingly protects 
the surface of the water beneath from rapid cooling; hence 
new-formed pancake ice does not increase excessively in thick- 
ness in one winter, and even in the centre of the Arctic Basin 
the ice-covering only amounts to 6 or at most 9 ft. in the course 
of a year, while in the Antarctic regions the season's growth 
is only half as great; in the latter also the accumulated snow 
is an important factor in the thickness of the ice, and snow 
is an even worse conductor of heat. The influence of wind and 
tide breaks up the frozen surface of the sea, and sheets yielding 
to the pressures slide over or under one another and are worked 
together into a hummocky ice-pack, the irregularities on the 
surface of which, caused by repeated fractures and collisions, 
may be from 10 to 20 ft. high. Such formations, termed 
ioross by the Russians, may extend under water, according to 
MakarofPs investigations, to at least an equal depth. Such old 
sea-ice when prevented from escaping forms the palaeocrystic 
sea of Nares; but, as a rule, it is carried southward in the East 
Greenland and Labrador currents, and melted in the warmer 
seas of lower latitudes. In the southern hemisphere the ice- 
pack forms a nearly continuous fence around the Antarctic 
continent. Pack-ice forms regularly in the inner part of the 
Baltic every winter, but not in the Norwegian fjords. Even 
in the Mediterranean sea-ice is formed annually in the northern 
part of the Black Sea, and more rarely in the Gulf of Salonica 
and at the head of the Adriatic off Triest. Hudson Bay is blocked 
by ice for a great part of the year, and the Gulf of St Lawrence 
is blocked every winter. Ice also clothes the continental shores 
of the northern fringing seas of eastern Asia. In addition to 
sea-ice, icebergs which are of land origin occur at sea. In the 
north, icebergs break off, as a rule, from the ends of the great 
glaciers of Greenland, and in the far south from the edge of the 
great Antarctic ice-barrier. The latter often gives birth to pro- 
digious icebergs and ice islands, which are carried northward 
by ocean currents, nearly as far as the tropical zone before they 
melt. Thus in December 1906, an iceberg was seen off the mouth 
of the La Plata in 38 S., and in 1840 one was seen near Cape 
Agulhas in 35 S. The Antarctic icebergs are of tabular form 
and much larger than those of Greenland, but in either case 
an iceberg rising to 200 ft. above sea-level is uncommon, and 
one exceeding 300 ft. is very rare. The Greenland icebergs 
are carried by the Labrador current across the great banks 
of Newfoundland, where they are often very numerous in the 
months from February to August, when they constitute a danger 
to shipping as far south as 40 N. No icebergs occur in the 
North Pacific, and none has ever been reported nearer the 
coasts of Europe than off the Orkney Islands, and there only 
once, in 1836. 

Oceanic Circulation. — Although observations on marine 
currents were made near land or between islands even in anti- 
quity, accurate observations on the high seas have only been 
possible since chronometers furnished a practicable method of 
determining longitude, i.e. from the time of Cook, the circum- 
navigator. The difference between the position as determined 
astronomically and by dead-reckoning gives an excellent idea 
of the general direction and velocity of the surface currents. 
The first comprehensive study of the currents of the Atlantic 
was that carried out by James Rennell (1 790-1830), and since 
that time Findlay in his -Directories, Heinrich Berghaus, Maury 
and the officials of the various Hydrographic Departments 
have produced increasingly accurate descriptions of the currents* 
of the whole ocean, largely from material supplied by merchant 
captains. Direct observations of currents in the open sea 
are difficult,' and even when the ship is anchored the veering 
and rolling of the vessel produce disturbances that greatly 
affect the result. Such current-meters as those used by Aime* 
in 1 841 and by Irminger since 1858 only gave the direction of 
the deeper current by comparison with the surface current at the 
time of observation. Later apparatus, such as Pettersson's 
bifilar current-meter or his more recent electric-photographic 
apparatus, and Nansen and Ekman's propeller current-meter, 
measure both the direction and the velocity at any moderate 
depth from an anchored vessel. One of the indirect methods 
of investigating currents is by taking account of the initial 
temperature of the current and following it by the thermometer 
throughout its course; hence the familiar contrast between 
warm and cold currents, of which the Gulf Stream and the 
Labrador current are types. Benjamin Franklin in 1775 and 
Charles Blagden in 1781, by means of numerous observations of 
temperature made on board the packets plying on the Atlantic 
passage, determined the boundaries of these two currents and 
their seasonal variations with considerable precision. The 
differences of salinity support this method, and, especially in 
the northern European seas, often prove a sharper criterion of 
the boundaries than temperature itself; this is especially the 
case at the entrance to the Baltic. Evidence drawn from 
drift-wood, wrecks or special drift bottles is less distinct but 
still interesting and often useful; this method of investigation 
includes the use of icebergs as indicators of the trend of currents 
and also of plankton, the minute swimming or drifting organisms 
so abundant at the surface of the sea. 

The general lines of the currents of the oceans are fairly 
well understood, and along the most frequented ocean routes 
the larger seasonal variations have also been ascertained. The 
general scheme of ocean currents depends on the prevailing 
winds taken in conjunction with the configuration of the coast 
and its submarine approaches. The trade-wind regions corre- 
spond pretty closely with westward-flowing currents, while 
in the equatorial calm belts there are eastward-running counter- 
currents, these lying north of the equator in the Atlantic and 
Pacific, but south of the equator in the Indian Ocean. In the 
region of the westerly winds on the poleward side of 40 N. and 
S. the currents again flow generally eastward. A cyclonic circu- 
lation of the atmosphere is associated with a cyclonic circulation 
of the water of the ocean, as is well shown in the Norwegian Sea 
and North Atlantic between the Azores and Greenland. Where 
the trade-winds heap up the surface water against the east 
coasts of the continents the currents turn poleward. The north 
equatorial current divides into the current entering the Caribbean 
Sea and issuing thence by the Strait of Florida as the Gulf Stream, 
and the Antilles current passing to the north of the Antilles. 
Both currents unite off the coast of the United States and run 
northward, turning towards the east when they come within the 
influence of the prevailing westerly winds. In a similar manner 
the Brazil current, the Agulhas current and the East Australian 
current originate from the drift of the south-east trades, and 
in the North Pacific the Japan current arises from the north-east 
trade drift. The west- wind drifts on the poleward side carry 
back part of the water southward to reunite with the equatorial 
current, and thus there is set up an anticyclonic circulation 
of water between io° and 40 in each hemisphere, the movement 
of the water corresponding very closely with that of the wind. 
The coincidence of wind and current direction is most marked 
in the region of alternating monsoons in the north of the Indian 
Ocean and in the Malay Sea. 

The accordance of wind and currents is so obvious that it 
was fully recognized by seafaring men in the time of the first 
circumnavigators. Modern investigations have shown, however, 
that the relationship is by no means so simple as appears at first. 
We must remember that the ocean is a continuous sheet of water 
of a certain depth, and the conditions of continuity which hold 
good for all fluids require that there should be no vacant space 
within it; hence if a single water particle is set in motion, the 
whole ocean must respond, as Varenius pointed out in 1650. 
Thus all the water carried forward by any current must have 
the place it left immediately occupied by water from another 
place, so that only a complete system of circulation can exist 
in the ocean. Further, all water particles when moving undergo 
a deviation from a straight path due to the forces set up by the 
rotation of the earth deflecting them towards the right as they 
move in the northern hemisphere and towards the left in the 
southern. This deflecting force is directly proportional to the 
velocity and the mass of the particle and also to the sine of the 
latitude; hence it is zero at the equator and comes to a maximum 
at the poles. When the wind acts on the surface of the sea it 
drives before it the particles of the surface layer of water, and, 
as these cannot be parted from those immediately beneath, the 
internal friction of the fluid causes the propelling impulse to act 
through a considerable depth, and if the wind continued long 
enough it would ultimately set the whole mass of the ocean in 
motion right down to the bottom. The current set up by the 
grip of the wind sweeping over the surface is deflected by the 
earth's rotation about 45 to the right of the direction of the 
wind in the northern hemisphere and to the left in the southern. 
The deeper layers lag behind the upper in deflection and the 
velocity of the current rapidly diminishes in consequence. The 
older theory of the origin of drift currents enunciated by 
Zoppritz in 1878 was modified as indicated above by Nansen 
in 1 901, and Waif rid Ekman subsequently went further. He 
showed that at a certain depth the direction of the current 
becomes exactly the opposite of that which has been imposed by 
deflection on the surface current, and the strength is reduced 
thereby to only one-twentieth of that at the surface. He called 
the depth at which the opposed direction is attained the drift- 
current depth, and he found it to be dependent on the velocity 
of the surface current and on the latitude. According to Ekman 's 
calculation with a trade-wind blowing at 16 m. per hour, the 
drift-current depth in latitude 5 would be approximately 104 
fathoms, in latitude 15°, 55 fathoms, and in latitude 45 only 
from 33 to 38 fathoms. A strong wind of 38 m. an hour would 
produce a drift-current depth of 82 fathoms in latitude 45 , and 
a light breeze of 3 m. an hour only 22 fathoms. It follows that 
a pure trade- wind drift cannot reach to any great depth, and 
this seems to be confirmed by observation, as when tow-nets 
are sunk to depths of 50 fathoms and more in the region of the 
equatorial current they always show a strong drift away from 
the side of the ship, the ship itself following the surface current. 
Ekman shows further that in a pure drift current the mean 
direction of the whole mass of the current is perpendicular to 
the direction of the wind which sets it in motion. This produces 
a heaping-up of warm water towards the middle of the anti- 
cyclonic current circulation between io° and 40 , and on the other 
hand an updraught of deep water along the outer side of the 
cyclonic currents. The latter phenomenon is most clearly 
shown by the stripes of cold water along the west coasts of Africa 
and America, the current running along the coast tending to 
draw its water away seawards on the surface and the principle 
of continuity requiring the updraught of the cool deep layers 
to take its place. For this reason the up-welling coastal water 
is coldest close to the shore, and hence it only appears on the 
Somali coast during the south-west monsoon. On the flat 
coasts of Europe the influence of on-shore wind in driving in 
warm water, and of off-shore wind in producing an updraught of 
cold water, has long been familiar to bathers. In a similar way 
updraughts of cold water to the surface occur in the neighbour- 
hood of the equator, especially in the Central Atlantic and Pacific. 

When a drift-current impinges directly upon a coast there is a 
heaping up of surface water, giving rise to a counter-current in 
the depths, which maintains the level, and this counter-current, 
although subject to deflection on account of the rotation of the 
earth, is deflected much less than a pure drift-current would be. 
Such currents, due to the banking up of water, have a large 
share in setting the depths of the sea in motion, and so securing 
the vertical circulation and ventilation of the ocean. 

The difference in density which occurs between one part of 
the ocean and another, shares with the wind in the production 
of currents. Vertical movements are also produced by difference 
of temperature in the water, but these can only be feeble, as 
below 1000 fathoms the temperature differences between tropical 
and polar waters are very small. If we assign to a column of 
water at the equator the density Sj= 1-022 at the surface and 
1-028 at 1000 fathoms, or an average of 1-025, an d to a column 
of water at the polar circle a mean density of 1-028, there would 
result a difference of level equal to (1-028 — 1-025) X 1000= 
3 fathoms in a distance from the equator to the polar circle of 
some 4600 m. A gradient like this, only r in 1,350,000, could 
give rise only to an extremely feeble surface current polewards 
and an extremely feeble deep current towards the equator. 
If there were strong currents at the bottom of the ocean the 
uniform accumulation of the deposit of minute shells of globi- 
gerina and radiolarian ooze would be impossible, the rises and 
ridges would necessarily be swept clear of them, and the fact 
that this is not the case shows that from whatever cause the 
waters of the depths are set in motion, that motion must be of 
the most deliberate and gentlest kind. In exceptional cases, 
when a strong deep current does flow over a rise, as in the case 
of the Wyville Thomson Ridge, the bottom is swept clear of fine 
sediment. 

Strongly marked differences in density are produced by the 
melting of sea-ice, and this is of particular importance in the 
case of the great ice barrier round the Antarctic continent. 
0. Pettersson has made a careful study of ice melting as a motive 
power in oceanic circulation, and points out that it acts in two 
ways: on the surface it produces dilution of the water, forming 
a fresh layer and causing an outflow seaward of surface water 
with very low salinity; towards the deep water it produces a 
strong cooling effect, leading to increase of density and sinking 
of the chilled layers. Both actions result in the drawing in of 
an intermediate layer of water from a distance which takes part 
in the double system of vertical circulation as is indicated in 
fig. 2. The actual direction of this circulation is strongly modified 
by the influence of the earth's rotation. The existence of a layer 
of water of low salinity at a depth of 500 fathoms in the tropical 
oceans of the southern hemisphere is to be referred to this 
action of the melting ice of the Antarctic regions. Pettersson's 
view that ice-melting dominates the whole circulation of the 
oceans and regulates in particular the currents of the seas round 
northern Europe must, however, be looked on as carrying the 
explanation too far. 

Differences of density between the waters of enclosed seas and 
of the ocean are brought about in some instances by concentra- 
tion of the water of the sea on account of active evaporation, and 
in other instances by dilution on account of the great influx of 
land water. A very powerful vertical circulation is thus set up 
between enclosed seas and the outer ocean. The very dense 
water of the Red Sea and the Mediterranean makes the column 
of water Salter and heavier and the level lower than in the ocean 
beyond the straits. Hence a strong surface current sets inwards 
through the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb and Gibraltar, while an 
undercurrent flows outwards, raising the temperature and 
salinity of the ocean for a long distance beyond the straits.

vertical components of currents in high southern latitudes. 

Through the Bosporus and Dardanelles at the entrance of the 
Black Sea, and through the sound and belts at the entrance of 
the Baltic, streams of fresh surface-water flow outwards to the 
Salter Mediterranean and North Sea, while Salter water enters 
in each case as an undercurrent. Wind and tide greatly alter 
the strength of these currents due to difference of density, and 
the surface outflow may either be stopped or, in the case of the 
belts, actually reversed by a strong and steady wind. Both 
outflowing and inflowing currents are subject to the deflection 
towards the right imposed by the earth's rotation. 

Modern oceanography has found means to calculate quantita- 
tively the circulatory movements produced by wind and the 
distribution of temperature and salinity not only at the surface 
but in deep water. The methods first suggested by H. Mohn 
and subsequently elaborated by V. Bjerknes have been usefully 
applied in many cases, but they cannot take the place of direct 
observations of currents and of the fundamental processes and 
conditions underlying them. The determination of the exact 
relationship of cause and effect in the origin of ocean currents 
is a matter of great practical importance. The researches of 
Pettersson, Meinardus, H. N. Dickson and others leave no doubt, 
for example, that the variations in the intensity of the Gulf 
Stream, whether these be measured by the change in the strength 
of the current or in the heat stored in the water, produce great 
variations in the character of the weather of northern Europe. 
The connexion between variations of current strength and the 
conditions of existence and distribution of plankton are no less 
important, especially as they act directly or indirectly on the 
life-conditions of food fishes. 

Important current and temperature charts of the ocean and 
occasional memoirs are published for the Admiralty by the Meteoro- 
logical Office in London, by the U.S. Hydrographic Office in 
Washington, the Deutsche Seewarte in Hamburg, and also at 
intervals by the French, Russian, Dutch and Scandinavian admir- 
alties. Tilot Charts of the North Atlantic and North Pacific are 
issued monthly by the U.S. Hydrographic Office, and of the North 
Atlantic and of the Indian Ocean and Red Sea by the British Meteoro- 
logical Office, giving a conspectus of the normal conditions of weather 
and sea.

OCEAN CITY, a city and seaside resort of Cape May county, 
New Jersey, U.S.A., in the S.E. part of the state, about 10 m. 
S.W. of Atlantic City. Pop. (1890), 452; (1900), 1307; (1905), 
1835; (1910), 1950. It is served by the Atkritic City and the West 
Jersey & Seashore railways. The city is laid out to face both 
the ocean and Great Egg Harbor Bay, and is a popular resort 
during the summer months. Ocean City was incorporated as a 
borough in 1884, and was chartered as a city in 1897. 


OCEAN GROVE, a summer resort of Monmouth county, New 
Jersey, U.S.A., in the eastern part of the state, on the Atlantic 
coast, and 5 5 m. by rail S. of New York City. Pop. ( 1 909) , about 
2500. It is served by the Pennsylvania and the Central of New 
Jersey railways. It is noted as a religious and musical seaside 
resort, and in July and August, and especially in the last ten days 
of August, during its annual camp-meeting, is visited by 
thousands of people. Ocean Grove was founded in 1869 by the 
Ocean Grove Camp-Meeting Association of the Methodist 
Episcopal Church, as a place for religious worship, rest and 
recreation, free from all forms of questionable amusement, and 
is governed under a corporation charter, the corporation having 
power to place restrictions in all leases, 


OCEANIA, or Oceaniga, a name "used to cover all the islands 
of tbe Pacific Ocean (q.v.) which are included in the divisions of 
Polynesia, Micronesia, Melanesia, Australasia, &c. 


OCEANUS (Gr. 'Qtceavds), in Greek mythology, the greatest 
of rivers and at the same time a divine personification. Never 
mingling with the sea which it encloses, according to Homer it 
has neither source nor mouth. On its southern banks, from 
east to west, dwell the " blameless Aethiopians " in perfect 
happiness, and beyond it on the west, in the realms of eternal 
night, the " Cimmerians," wrapped in fogs and darkness. Here 
are the grove of Persephone and the entrance of tbe underworld. 
Personified, Oceanus is in Hesiod (Theog. 133, 337-370) the 
son of Uranus and Gaea, the husband of Tethys, father of 3000 
streams and 4000 ocean nymphs. In Homer he is the origin of 
all things, even the father of the gods, and the equal in rank of 
all of them save Zeus. This conception recurs in the theory of 
Thales, who made water the first principle of all things. The 
idea of Oceanus as a river flowing unceasingly round the earth, 
which was regarded as a flat circle, was of long continuance. 
Euripides was the first among the tragic poets to speak of it as 
a sea, but Herodotus before him ridiculed the notion of Oceanus 
as a river as an invention of the poets and described it as the 
great world sea. As the geographical knowledge of the Greeks 
extended, the name was applied to the outer sea (especially the 
Atlantic). 

In art, Oceanus was represented as an old man of noble 
presence and benevolent expression, with the horns of an ox 
and sometimes crab's claws on his head. His attributes are a 
pitcher, cornucopiae (" horn of plenty"), rushes, marine animals 
and a sceptre. On the altar of Pergamum he is depicted taking 
part in the battle of the giants.

OCELLUS LUCANUS, a Pythagorean philosopher, born in 
Lucania in the 5th century B.C., perhaps a pupil of Pythagoras 
himself. Stobaeus (Ed. Phys. i. 13) has preserved a fragment 
of his Uepl vbtiov (if he was really -the author) in the Doric 
dialect, but the only one of his alleged works which is extant is a 
short treatise in four chapters in the Ionic dialect generally 
known as On the Nature of the Universe. Excerpts from this are 
given in Stobaeus (i. 20), but in Doric. It is certainly not 
authentic, and cannot be dated earlier than the 1st century B.C. 
It maintains the doctrine that the universe is uncreated and 
eternal; that to its three great divisions correspond the three 
kinds of beings — gods, men and daemons; and, finally, that the 
human race with all its institutions (the family, marriage and 
the like) must be eternal. It advocates an ascetic mode of life, 
with a view to the perfect reproduction of the race and its 
training in all that is noble and beautiful.

OCELOT (Mexican Flalocelotl, literally field-jaguar, from 
Flalli t field, and ocelotl, tiger, jaguar), an American member 
(Felis pardalis) of the family Felidae, ranging from Arkansas in 
the north to Paraguay. The species is subject to great racial 
variation. The fur has, however, a tawny yellow or reddish- 
grey ground colour, marked with black spots, aggregated in 
streaks and blotches, or in elongated rings enclosing areas rather 
darker than the general ground-colour. In the typical form the 
total length may reach 4 ft.; the average measurement of the 
head and body lies between 26 in. and 33 in., and of the tail be- 
tween 1 1 in. and 1 5 in. The ocelot is essentially a forest cat, and a 
ready climber; its disposition is said to be fierce and bloodthirsty 
but in confinement it becomes tame and playful. In Asia the 
group is represented by the Tibetan Felis tristis.

OCHAKOV, a fortified town and port of Russia, in the govern- 
ment of Kherson, 41 m. E. of Odessa, on a cape of the Black 
Sea, at the entrance to the estuary of the Dnieper, and opposite 
to Kinburn. Pop. (1897), 10,784. Strong fortifications have 
been built at Ochakov and on the Kinburn promontory, to 
protect the entrance to the Dnieper. Ochakov stands close 
to the site of the old Miletan (Greek) colony of Olvia and the 
Greek colony of Alektor. The fortress of Kara-kerman or 
Ozu-kaleh was built on this spot by the khan of the Crimea, 
Mengli Girai, in 1492. At a later date it became the centre of 
a Turkish province which included Khaji-dereh (Ovidiopol), 
Khaji-bey (Odessa), and Dubossary, as well as some 150 villages, 
Russia, regarding it as the main obstacle to the possession of 
the Black Sea littoral, besieged it in 1737, when it was captured 
by Marshal Miinnich, but in the following year it was abandoned, 
and in 1739 restored to Turkey. The second siege by Russia 
was begun in 1788, and lasted six months, until the fortress was 
stormed and taken, after a terrible loss of life. By the peace of 
1 791 it became Russian. In 1855 it was bombarded by the 
Anglo-French fleet, and after that the Russians demolished the 
fortifications. 


OCHILTREE, a barony in the county of Ayr, Scotland, from 
which a title in the Scottish peerage was held in the 16th and 
1 7th centuries by a branch of the house of Stewart. Sir Andrew 
Stewart (d. 1488), chancellor of Scotland, a great-grandson of 
the regent Albany (d. 1420), was created Baron Avandale or 
Avondale about 1457. This peerage became extinct at his 
death, but was revived about 1499 in favour of his nephew and 
heir Andrew Stewart, who, being killed at the battle of Flodden 
in 1513, was succeeded by his son Andrew, 2nd Baron Avandale 
of this creation; and the latter obtained an act of parliament 
in 1543 empowering him to exchange the title of Lord Avandale 
for that of Lord Ochiltree, or Lord Stewart of Ochiltree. His 
son, Andrew, 2nd Lord Ochiltree (d. c. 1600), was a zealous 
supporter of the lords of the congregation, and especially of John 
Knox, in the struggle against Mary queen of Scots, and was 
wounded at the battle of Langside while fighting against the 
queen. Of his five sons, William was slain by the earl of 
Bothwell in 1588, and James, created earl of Arran in 1581, was 
the father of Sir James Stewart of Killeith who became 4th 
Lord Ochiltree in 161 5; his daughter Margaret was the second 
wife of John Knox. His brother Henry Stewart married 
Margaret Tudor , widow of James IV. of Scotland, and was 
created Baron Methven by James V. in 1528; and another 
brother, Sir James Stewart of Beath, was ancestor of the Stewart 
earls of Moray, through his son James who was created Lord 
Doune in 1581. 

The second Lord Ochiltree was succeeded in the peerage by 
his grandson Andrew, who resigned the title in 161 5, and having 
been summoned by writ to the Irish House of Lords was created 
Baron Castle Stewart in the Irish peerage in 161 9. The barony 
of Ochiltree which he thus resigned was conferred in 1615 on 
his cousin Sir James Stewart of Killeith (see above), son of the 
earl of Arran; and on the death without issue of his son William, 
5th Lord Ochiltree, in 1675, the title became extinct. In 1774 
Andrew Thomas Stewart successfully claimed the, barony of 
Castle Stewart in the peerage of Ireland as heir male under the 
creation of 16 19; but although he was permitted in 1790 to 
vote as Lord Ochiltree in an election of Scottish representative 
peers, his claim to this barony as collateral heir of the grantee 
of 1615 was disallowed by the House of Lords in 1793. 


OCHINO, BERNARDINO (1487-1564), Italian Reformer, 
was bom at Siena in 1487. At an early age he entered the order 
of Observantine Friars, the strictest sect of the Franciscans, 
and rose to be its general, but, craving a yet stricter rule, trans- 
ferred himself in 1534 to the newly founded order of Capuchins, 
of which in 1538 he was elected vicar-general. In 1539, urged 
by Bembo, he visited Venice and delivered a remarkable course 
of sermons, showing a decided tendency to the doctrine of 
iustification by faith, which appears still more evidently in his 
Dialogi VII. published soon after. • He was suspected and 
denounced, but nothing ensued until, at the instigation of the 
austere zealot CarafTa, the Inquisition was established at Rome, 
June 1542. Ochino was at once cited, but was deterred from 
presenting himself at Rome by the warnings of Peter Martyr 
and of Cardinal Contarini, whom he found at Bologna, dying 
of poison administered by the reactionary party. After some 
hesitation he escaped across the Alps to Geneva. He was 
cordially received by Calvin, and within two years published six 
volumes of Prediche, tracts rather than sermons, explaining and 
vindicating his change of religion. Twenty-five of these were 
published in English at Ipswich in 1548. In 1545 he became 
minister of the Italian Protestant congregation at Augsburg, 
which he was compelled to forsake when, in January 1547, 
the city was occupied by the imperial forces in the Schmalkaldic 
War. Escaping by way of Strassburg he found an asylum in 
England, where he was made a prebendary of Canterbury, 
received a pension from Edward VI. 's privy purse, and com- 
posed his chief work, A Trajedy or Dialogue of the unjust usurped 
Primacy of the Bishop of Rome (1549). This remarkable per- 
formance, originally written in Latin, is extant only in the 
translation of John Ponet, bishop of Winchester, a splendid 
specimen of nervous English. The conception is highly 
dramatic; the form is that of a series of dialogues. Lucifer, 
enraged at the spread of Christ's kingdom, convokes the fiends 
in council, and resolves to set up the pope as Antichrist. The 
state, represented by the emperor Phocas, is persuaded to 
connive at the pope's assumption of spiritual authority; the 
other churches are intimidated into acquiescence; Lucifer's 
projects seem fully accomplished, when Heaven raises up Henry 
VIII. and his son for their overthrow. The conception bears 
a remarkable resemblance to that of Paradise Lost; and it is 
almost certain that Milton, whose sympathies with the Italian 
Reformation were so strong, must have been acquainted with it, 
and with some of his later works. In the Labyrinth (dedicated 
to Queen plizabeth of England), a discussion of the freedom 
of the will, he covertly assailed the Calvinistic doctrine of 
predestination, and showed that his views were tinged with 
Socinianism. 

The accession of Mary in 1553 drove him from England, and 
he became pastor of the Italian congregation at Zurich. In 
1563 the long-gathering storm of obloquy burst upon the occasion 
of the publication of his Thirty Dialogues, in one of which his 
adversaries maintained that he had justified polygamy under 
colour of a pretended refutation. His dialogues on divorce 
and the Trinity were also obnoxious. Ochino was banished 
from Zurich, and, after being refused a shelter by other Protestant 
cities, directed his steps towards Poland, at that time the most 
tolerant state in Europe. He had not resided there long when 
the edict of the 6th of August 1564 banished all foreign dis- 
sidents. Flying from the country, he encountered the plague 
at Pinczoff; three of his four children were carried off; and 
he himself, worn out by age and misfortune, died in solitude 
and obscurity at Schlakau in Moravia, about the end of 1564. 
His reputation among Protestants was at the time so bad that 
he was charged with the authorship of the treatise De tribus 
impostoribuSj as well as with having carried his alleged approval 
of polygamy into practice. It was reserved for Dr Benrath to 
justify him, and to represent him as a fervent evangelist and 
at the same time as a speculative thinker with a passion for 
free inquiry. The general tendency of his mind ran counter 
to tradition, and he is remarkable as resuming in his individual 
history all the phases of Protestant theology from Luther to 
Socinus. 

See Life by B. O. Benrath (2nd ed., Brunswick, 1892), translated 
into English by Helen Zimmern (London, 1876) . In addition to 
the books already named, he wrote Italian expositions of Romans 
(Geneva, 1545) and Galatians (Augsburg, 1546). 


OCHRES, a class of pigments varying in colour from yellow to 
red, and consisting mainly of hydrated iron oxide. The Yellow 
Ochres are native earths coloured with hydrated ferric oxide, the 
brownish yellow substance that colours, and is deposited from, 
highly ferruginous water. These ochres are of two kinds — one 
having an argillaceous basis, while the other is a calcareous earth, 
the argillaceous variety being in general the richer and more pure 
in colour of the two. Both kinds are widely distributed, fine 
qualities being found in Oxfordshire, the Isle of Wight, near 
Jena and Nuremberg in Germany, and in France in the depart- 
ments of Yonne, Cher and Nievre. The original colour of these 
ochres can be modified and varied into browns and reds of more 
or less intensity by calcination. The nature of the associated 
earth also influences the colour assumed by an ochre under 
calcination, aluminous ochres developing red and violet tints, 
while the calcareous varieties take brownish-red and dark-brown 
hues. The well-known ochre Terra da Sienna which in its raw 
state is a dull-coloured ochre, becomes when burnt a fine warm 
mahogany brown hue highly valued for artistic purposes. 
Yellow ochres are also artificially prepared — Mars Yellow being 
either pure hydrated ferric oxide or an intimate mixture of that 
substance with an argillaceous or calcareous earth, and such 
compounds by careful calcination can be transformed into Mars 
Orange, Violet or Red, all highly important, stable and reliable 
pigments. 


OCHRIDA (also written Okhrida and Achrida; Turkish 
Ochri), a city of Albania, European Turkey, in the vilayet of 
Monastir; on the north-eastern shore of Lake Ochrida, and at the 
eastern end of the Roman Via Egnatia. Pop. (1905) about 
11,000, including Albanians, Turks, Greeks and Slavs. Ochrida 
occupies the site of the ancient Lychnidos, which was added to 
the Macedonian empire by Philip II. (382-336 B.C.) , and destroyed 
by the Bulgarians in a.d. 861. It is the scat of Bulgarian and 
Greek bishops. m From the creation of the Bulgarian patriarchate 
of Ochrida in 893 to its abolition in 1767 the city was the ecclesi- 
astical headquarters of the Bulgarians in the west of the Balkan 
Peninsula. Lake Ochrida is 2260 ft. above sea-level, in a moun- 
tainous limestone region of Karst formation. It measures 107 
sq. m., and has a maximum depth of 938 ft. Its waters are 
supplied by subterranean streams. Its chief outlet is the river 
Black Drin, on the north.

graphical Journal, vol. xvi. (London, 1900). 


OCHSENFURT, a town of Germany, in the kingdom of Bavaria, 
situated on the left bank of the Main, here crossed by a stone 
bridge, 13 m. S. from Wlirzburg by the railway to Munich, 
and at the junction of a line to Rottingen. Pop. (1905) 3333. 
It contains an Evangelical and five Roman Catholic churches, 
among them that of St Michael, a fine Gothic edifice. There is 
a considerable trade in wine and agricultural produce, other 
industries being brewing and malting. 


OCHTERLONY, SIR DAVID, Bart. (1758-1825), British 
general, was born at Boston, Mass., U.S.A., on the 12th of 
February 1758, and went to India as a cadet in 1777. He served 
under Lord Lake in the battles of Koil, Aligarh and Delhi, and 
was appointed resident at Delhi in 1803. In 1804, having been 
promoted to the rank of major-general, he defended the city with 
a very inadequate force against an attack by Holkar. On the 
outbreak of the Nepal War (1814-1 5) he was given the command 
of one of four converging columns, and his services were rewarded 
with a baronetcy in 1815. Subsequently he was promoted to the 
command of the main force in its advance on Katmandu, and 
outmanoeuvring the Gurkhas by a flank march at the Kourea 
Ghat Pass, brought the war to a successful conclusion and 
obtained the signature of the treaty of Segauli (18 16), which 
dictated the subsequent relations of the British with Nepal. 
For this success Ochterlony was created G.C.B., the first time 
that honour had been conferred on an officer of the Indian army. 
In the Pindari War (181 7-18) he was in command of the Raj- 
putana column, made a separate agreement with Amir Khan, 
detaching him from the Pindaris, and then, interposing his 
own force between the two main divisions of the enemy, brought 
the war to an end without an engagement. He was appointed 
resident in Rajputana in 1818, with which the residency at 
Delhi was subsequently combined. When Durjan Sal revolted 
in 1825 against Balwant Singh, the infant Raja of Bharatpur, 
Ochterlony acting on his own responsibility supported the raja 
by proclamation and ordered out a force to support him. Lord 
Amherst, however, repudiated these proceedings. Ochterlony, 
who was bitterly chagrined by this rebuff, resigned his office, and 
retired to Delhi. The feeling that the confidence which his length 
of service merited had not been given him by the governor- 
general is said to have accelerated his death, which occurred 
at Meerut on the 15th of July 1825. The Ochterlony column 
at Calcutta commemorates his name.

OCHTMAN, LEONARD (1854- ), American painter, was 
born in Zonnemaire, Zeeland, Holland, on the 21st of October 
1854. His family removed to Albany, New York, in 1866. 
In 1882 he began to exhibit landscapes at the National 
Academy, and he became a National Academician in 1904. 
His most characteristic pictures, which recall the work 
of Inness, are scenes on Long Island Sound and on the Mianus 
river. 


OCKLEY, SIMON (1678-1720), English orientalist, was born 
at Exeter in 1678. - He was educated at Queen's College, Cam- 
bridge, became fellow of Jesus College and vicar of Swavesey, 
and in 1 7 1 1 was made professor of Arabic at Cambridge. He had 
a large family, and the pecuniary embarrassments of his later 
days form the subject of a chapter in Disraeli's Calamities of 
Authors, The preface to the second volume of his History of the 
Saracens is dated from Cambridge Castle, where he was imprisoned 
for debt. Ockley maintained that a knowledge of Oriental 
literature was essential to the proper study of theology, and in 
the preface to his first book, the Introductio ad linguas orientates 
(1706), he urges the importance of the study. In 1707 he pub- 
lished a translation of Leon Modena's History of the Present 
Jews throughout the World; and in 1708 The Improvement of 
Human Reason, exhibited in the Life of Hai Ebn Yokdhan. His 
chief work is The History of the Saracens (1708-1718), of which 
a third volume was published posthumously in 1757. Un- 
fortunately Ockley took as his main authority a MS. in the 
Bodleian of the pseudo-Wakidi's Fuluh al-Sham, which is rather 
historical romance than history. He also translated from the 
Arabic the Second Book of Esdras and the Sentences of AIL 
Ockley died at Swavesey on the 9th of August 1720. 


OTLERY, MICHAEL (1575-1643), Irish chronicler, grandson 
of a chief of the sept of O'Clery in Donegal, was born at Kil- 
barrow on Donegal Bay, and was baptized Tadhg (or " poet "), 
but took the name of Michael when he became a Franciscan 
friar. He was a cousin of Lughaidh O'Clery (fl. 1 595-1630), 
who,withhissonCacrigcricheO'Clery(d. 1664) — oneof Michael's 
co-workers — is also famous as an Irish historian. He had 
already gained a reputation as an antiquary and student of 
Irish history and literature, when he entered the Irish College 
of St Anthony at Louvain. In 1620, through the initiative of 
Hugh Boy Macanward (1 580-1635), warden of the college, and 
himself a famous Irish historian and poet, and one of an old 
family of hereditary bards in Tyrconnell, he began to collect 
Irish manuscripts and to transcribe everything he could find of 
historical importance; he was assisted by other Irish scholars, 
and the results were his Reim Rioghroidhe (Royal List) in 1630, 
Leabhar Gabhala (Book of Invasions) in 1631, and his most 
famous work, called by John Colgan (d. 1659), the Irish bio- 
grapher, the "Annals of the Four Masters" (1636). Subsequently 
he produced his Martyrologium of Irish saints, based on various 
ancient manuscripts, an Irish glossary and other works. He 
lived in poverty, and died at Louvain. 


O'CONNELL, DANIEL (1775-1847), Irish statesman, known 
as " the Liberator," was born on the 6th of August 1775 near 
Cahirciveen, a small town in Kerry. He was sprung from a 
race the heads of which had been Celtic chiefs, had lost their 
lands in the wars of Ireland, and had felt the full weight of the 
harsh penal code which long held the Catholic Irish down. 
His ancestors in the 18th century had sent recruits to the famous 
brigade of Irish exiles in the service of France, 1 and those who 
remained at home either lived as tenants on the possessions of 
which they had once been lords, or gradually made money by 
smuggling, a very general calling in that wild region. Thus he 
inherited from his earliest years, with certain traditions of birth 
and high station, a strong dislike of British rule in Ireland and 
of the dominant owners of the soil, a firm attachment to his 
proscribed faith, and habitual skill in evading the law; and these 
influences may be traced in his subsequent career. While a boy 
he was adopted by his uncle, Maurice O'Connell of Derrynane, 
and sent to a school at Queenstown, one of the first which the 
state in those days allowed to be opened for Catholic teaching; 
and a few years afterwards he became a student, as was customary 
with Irish youths of his class, in the English colleges of St Omer 
and Douai in France. These years in France had a decided 
effect in forming his judgment on political questions of high 
moment. He was an eye-witness on more than one occasion of 
the folly and excesses of the French Revolution; and these 
scenes not only increased his love for his church, but strongly 
impressed him with that dread of anarchy, of popular movements 
ending in bloodshed, and of communistic and socialistic views 
which characterized him in after life. To these experiences, 
too, we may partly ascribe the reverence for law, for the rights 
of property, and for the monarchical form of government which 
he appears to have sincerely felt; and, demagogue as he became 
in a certain sense, they gave his mind a deep Conservative tinge. 
In 1798 he was called to the bar of Ireland, and rose before long 
to the very highest eminence among contemporary lawyers 
and advocates. This position was in the main due to a dexterity 
in conducting causes, and especially in examining witnesses, 
in which he had no rival at the Irish bar. He was, however, 
a thorough lawyer besides, inferior in scientific learning to two 
or three of his most conspicuous rivals, but well read in every 
department of law, and especially a master in all that relates 
to criminal and constitutional jurisprudence. As an advocate, 
too, he stood in the very highest rank; in mere oratory he was 
surpassed by Plunket, and in rhetorical gifts by Bushe, the only 
speakers to be named with him in his best days at the Irish bar; 
but his style, if not of the most perfect kind, and often disfigured 
by decided faults, was marked by a peculiar subtlety and 
manly power, and produced great and striking effects. On the 
whole, in the art of winning over juries he had scarcely an equal 
in the law courts. 

To understand, however, O'Connell's greatness we must look 
to the field of Irish politics. From early manhood he had turned 
his mind to the condition of Ireland and the mass of her people. 
The worst severities of the penal code had been, in a certain 
measure, relaxed, but the Catholics were still in a state of vassal- 
age, and they were still pariahs compared with the Protestants. 
The rebellion of 1798 and the union had dashed the hopes of 
the Catholic leaders, and their prospects of success seemed very 
remote when, in the first years of the 19th century, the still 
unknown lawyer took up their cause. Up to this juncture the 
question had been in the hands of Grattan and other Protestants, 
and of a small knot of Catholic nobles and prelates; but their 
efforts had not accomplished much, and they aimed only at 
a kind of compromise, which, while conceding their principal 
claims, would have placed their church in subjection to the 
state. O'Connell inaugurated a different policy, and had soon 
given the Catholic movement an energy it had not before 
possessed. Himself a Roman Catholic of birth and genius, 
unfairly kept back in the race of life, he devoted his heart and 
soul to the cause, and his character and antecedents made him 
the champion who ultimately assured its triumph. He formed 
the bold design of combining the Irish Catholic millions, under the 
superintendence of the native priesthood, into a vast league 
against the existing order of things, and of wresting the concession 
of the Catholic claims from every opposing party in the state by 
an agitation, continually kept up, and embracing almost the 
whole of the people, but maintained within constitutional 
limits, though menacing and shaking the frame of society. He 
gradually succeeded in carrying out his purpose: the Catholic 
Association, at first small, but slowly assuming larger proportions, 
was formed; attempts of the government and of the local 
authorities to put its branches down were skilfully baffled by 
legal devices of many kinds; and at last, after a conflict of years, 
all Catholic Ireland was arrayed to a man in an organization 
of enormous power, that demanded its rights with no uncertain 
voice. O'Connell, having long before attained an undisputed 
and easy ascendancy, stood at the head of this great national 
movement; but it will be observed that, having been controlled 
from first to last by himself and the priesthood, it had little in 
common with the mob rule and violence which he had never 
ceased to regard with aversion. His election for Clare in 1828 
proved the forerunner of the inevitable change, and the Catholic 
claims were granted the next year, to the intense regret of the 
Protestant Irish, by a government avowedly hostile to the last, 
but unable to withstand the overwhelming pressure of a people 
united to insist on justice. The result, unquestionably, was 
almost wholly due to the energy and genius of a single man, 
though the Catholic question would have been settled, in all 
probability, in the course of time; and it must be added that 
O'Connell 's triumph, which showed what agitation could effect 
in Ireland, was far from doing his country unmixed good. 

O'Connell joined the Whigs on entering parliament, and 
gave effective aid to the cause of reform. The agitation, however, 
on the Catholic question had quickened the sense of the wrongs 
of Ireland, and the Irish Catholics were engaged ere long in a 
crusade against tithes and the established church, the most 
offensive symbols of their inferiority in the state. It may be 
questioned whether O'Connell was not rather led than a leader 
in this; the movement, at least, passed beyond his control, 
and the country for many months was terrorized by scenes 
of appalling crime and bloodshed. Lord Grey, very properly, 
proposed measures of repression to put this anarchy down, 
and O'Connell opposed them with extreme vehemence, a 
seeming departure from his avowed principles, but natural 
in the case of a popular tribune. This caused a breach between 
him and the Whigs; but he gradually returned to his allegiance 
to them when they practically abolished Irish tithes, cut down 
the revenues of the established church and endeavoured to 
secularize the surplus. By this time O'Connell had attained 
a position of great eminence in the House of Commons: as a 
debater he stood in the very first rank, though he had entered 
St Stephen's after fifty; and his oratory, massive and strong 
in argument, although too often scurrilous and coarse, and marred 
by a bearing in which cringing flattery and rude bullying were 
strangely blended, made a powerful, if not a pleasing, impression. 
O'Connell steadily supported Lord Melbourne's government, 
gave it valuable aid in its general measures, and repeatedly 
expressed his cordial approval of its policy in advancing Irish 
Catholics to places of trust and power in the state, though 
personally he refused a high judicial office. Though a strict 
adherent of the creed of Rome, he was a Liberal, nay a Radical, 
as regards measures for the vindication of human liberty, and 
he sincerely advocated the rights of conscience, the emancipation 
of the slave and freedom of trade. But his rooted aversion to 
the democratic theories imported from France, which were 
gradually winning their way into England, only grew stronger 
with advancing age. His conservatism was most apparent 
in his antipathy to socialistic doctrines and his tenacious regard 
for the claims of property. He actually opposed the Irish Poor 
Law, as encouraging a communistic spirit; he declared a move- 
ment against rent a crime; and, though he had a strong sympathy 
with the Irish peasant, and advocated a reform of his precarious 
tenure, it is difficult to imagine that he could have approved 
the cardinal principle of the Irish Land Act of 1 881, the judicial 
adjustment of rent by the state. 

O'Connell changed his policy as regards Ireland when Peel 
became minister in 1S41. He declared that a Tory regime in 
his country was incompatible with good government, and he 
began an agitation for the repeal of the union. One of his motives 
in taking this course no doubt was a strong personal dislike 
of Peel, with whom he had often been in collision, and who had 
singled him out in 1829 for what must be called a marked affront. 
O'Connell, nevertheless, was sincere and even consistent in his 
conduct: he had denounced the union in early manhood as 
an obstacle to the Catholic cause; he had spoken against the 
measure in parliament; he believed that the claims of Ireland 
were set aside or slighted in what he deemed an alien assembly; 
and, though he had ceased for some years to demand repeal, 
and regarded it as rather a means than an end, he was throughout 
life an avowed repealer. It should be observed, however, that 
in his judgment the repeal of the union would not weaken the 
real bond between Great Britain and Ireland; and he had 
nothing in common with the revolutionists who, at a later period, 
openly declared for the separation of the two countries by 
physical force. The organization which had effected such 
marvellous results in 1828-1829 was recreated for the new project. 
Enormous meetings, convened by the priesthood, and directed 
or controlled by O'Connell, assembled in 1 842-1843, and probably 
nine-tenths of the Irish Catholics were unanimous in the cry 
for repeal. O'Connell seems to have thought success certain; 
but he had not perceived the essential difference between his 
earlier agitation and this. The enlightened opinion of the three 
kingdoms for the most part approved the Catholic claims, and 
as certainly it condemned repeal. After some hesitation Peel 
resolved to put down the repeal movement. A vast intended 
meeting was proclaimed unlawful, and in October 1843 O'Connell 
was arrested and held to bail, with ten or twelve of his principal 
followers. He was convicted (February 1844) after the trials 
that followed, but they were not good specimens of equal justice, 
and the sentence of imprisonment for a year and a fine of £2000 
was reversed on a writ of error by the House of Lords (September 
1844), and he and his colleagues were again free. The spell, 
however, of O'ConnelPs power had vanished; his health had 
suffered much from a short confinement; he was verging upon 
his seventieth year; and he was alarmed and pained by the 
growth of a party in the repeal ranks who scoffed at his views, 
and advocated the revolutionary doctrines which he had always 
feared and abhorred. Before long famine had fallen on the 
land, and under this visitation the repeal movement, already 
paralysed, wholly collapsed. O'Connell died on the 15th of 
May 1847, at Genoa, whilst on his way to Rome. His body 
was brought back to Dublin and buried in Glasnevin cemetery. 

O'Connell was a remarkable man in every sense of the word, 
of splendid physique, and with all the attractions of a popular 
leader. Catholic Ireland calls him her "Liberator" still; and 
history will say of him that, with some failings, he had many 
and great gifts, that he was an orator of a high order, and that, 
agitator as he was, he possessed the wisdom, the caution and 
the tact of a real statesman. Nevertheless he not only failed 
to accomplish the chief aim of his life, but Lecky trenchantly 
observes that " by a singular fatality the great advocate of 
repeal did more than any one else to make the Union a necessity. 
... He destroyed the sympathy between the people and their 
natural leaders; and he threw the former into the hands of 
men who have subordinated all national to ecclesiastical con- 
siderations, or into the hands of reckless, ignorant, and dishonest 
adventurers." O'Connell married in 1802 his cousin Mary 
O'Connell, by whom he had three daughters and four sons, 
Maurice, Morgan, John (1810-1858), known as the "Young 
Liberator," and Daniel, who all sat in parliament. 

His son John published a Life in 1846 and^ Recollections and 
Experiences in 1849. There are also biographies by W. Fagan 
(1847), M. F. Cusack (1872), J. O'Rourke and O'Keeffe (1875), 
and J. A. Hamilton (1888). See especially W. E. H. Lecky's essay 
in the revised edition of his Leaders of Public Opinion in Ireland 
vol. ii. (1903). (W. O. M.)

(1 745-1 833), to whose property he fell heir, in Mrs O'Connell's

Brigade in the Service of France (1870). 


O'CONNOR, FEARGUS EDWARD (1794-1855), Chartist 
leader, was a son of the Irish Nationalist politician Roger 
O'Connor (1 762-1834), and nephew of Arthur O'Connor (1763- 
1852), who was the agent in France for Emmet's rebellion; 
both belonged to the " United Irishmen." He entered parlia- 
ment as member for the county of Cork in 1832. Though a 
zealous supporter of repeal, he endeavoured to supplant O'Con- 
nell as the leader of the party, an attempt which aroused against 
him the popular antipathy of the Irish. In 1835 he was un- 
seated on petition, and after standing unsuccessfully for Oldham 
he took to stumping England in favour of the new Radical 
doctrines of the day, and the use of physical force for their 
adoption. In 1837 he established the Northern Star newspaper 
at Leeds, and became a vehement advocate of the Chartist 
movement. He was imprisoned for seditious libel in 1840, and 
after his release became prominent for his attack on John 
Bright, and the anti-corn-law league. In 1847 he was returned 
for Nottingham, and in 1848 he presided at a Chartist demon- 
stration on Kennington Common, which caused great alarm 
(see Chartism). But the projected march on Westminster 
fizzled out when the preparations made to receive it became 
known. The eccentricity which had characterized his opinions 
from the beginning of his career gradually became more marked 
until they developed into insanity. He began to conduct 
himself in a disorderly manner in the House of Commons, and 
in 1852 he was found to be of unsound mind by a commission 
of lunacy. He died at London on the 30th of August 1855, 
and was buried in Kensal Green cemetery. 


OCONOMOWOC, a city of Waukesha county, Wisconsin, 
U.S.A., about 3$ m. W. of Milwaukee. Pop. (1890) 2729; (1900) 
2880; (1905) 3013; (1910) 3054. It is served by the Chicago, 
Milwaukee & St Paul railway and by an electric railway con- 
necting with Milwaukee. Oconomowoc is one of the most 
popular summer resorts in the Middle West. Along the shore 
of Lakes Fowler and La Belle are some beautiful country estates, 
several large hotels and fine club houses, and two sanatoria. 
At Delafield and at Dousman (8 m. S. of Oconomowoc) there 
are state fish hatcheries, the former for black bass. Oconomowoc 
was. settled about 1837 and incorporated in 1875; its name 
is an Indian word, said to mean " home of the beaver." 


O'CONOR, CHARLES (1804-1884), American lawyer, was 
born in the city of New York on the 22nd of January 1804, 
and was the son of Thomas O'Conor (1770-1855), who in 1801 
emigrated from Roscommon county, Ireland, to New York, 
where he devoted himself chiefly to journalism. The son 
studied law, was admitted to the bar in 1824, and soon won 
high reputation in his profession. He was United States district 
attorney for New York in 1853-1854. In politics an extreme 
States'-Rights Democrat, he opposed the coercion of the South, 
and after the Civil War became senior counsel for Jefferson 
Davis on his indictment for treason, and was one of his bonds- 
men; these facts and O' Conor's connexion with the Roman 
Catholic Church affected unfavourably his political fortunes. 
In 1872 he was nominated for the presidency by the " Bourbon " 
Democrats, who refused to support Horace Greeley, and by the 
" Labour Reformers "; he declined the nomination butreceived 
21,559 votes. He took a prominent part in the prosecution of 
William M. Tweed and members of the " Tweed Ring," and 
published Peculation Triumphant, Being the Record of a Five 
Years* Campaign against Official Malversation, AM. 1871-1875 
(1875). He removed to Nantucket, Massachusetts, in 1881, 
and died there on the 12th of May 1884, 


OCONTO, a city and the county-seat of Oconto county, 
Wisconsin, U.S.A., about 130 m. N. of Milwaukee, on the W. 
shore of Green Bay, at the mouth of the Oconto river. Pop. 
(1890) 5219; (1900) 5646, of whom 1544 were foreign-born; 
(1905) 5722; (1910) 5629. It is served by the Chicago & North- 
Western and the Chicago, Milwaukee & St Paul railways. The 
city lies in a good farming country, and has a considerable lake 
commerce in lumber and fish. The first settlement was made 
here in 1846, and Oconto was chartered as a city in 1882. 


OCRICULUM (mod. Otricoli), an ancient town of Umbria, 
Italy, on the Via Flaminia, near the E. bank of the Tiber, 44 m. 
N. of Rome and 12 m. S. of Narnia. It concluded an alliance 
with Rome in 308 B.C. The modern village lies higher than the 
ancient town, and excavations on the site of the latter in 1775 
and following years led to the discovery of the baths, a theatre, 
a basilica and other buildings. In the baths were found a number 
of works of ar.t, now in the Vatican, notably the mosaic pave- 
ment of the Sala della Rotonda, and the celebrated head of Zeus 
and the head of Claudius in the same room. An amphitheatre 
is still visible, but the other buildings have in the main been 
covered up again, 


OCTAHEDRON (Gr. omb, eight, e5pa, base), a solid bounded 
by eight triangular faces; it has 6 vertices and 12 edges. The 
regular octahedron has for its faces equilateral triangles; it 
is the reciprocal of the cube. Octahedra having triangular 
faces other than equilateral occur as crystal forms. See Poly- 
hedron and Crystallography. 


OCTAVE (from Lat. oclavus, eighth, oclo, eight), a period 
or series of eight members. In ecclesiastical usage the octave 
is the eighth day after a particular church festival, the feast 
day itself and the " octave " being counted. The octave thus 
always falls* on the same day of the week as the festival, and 
any event occurring during the period is said to be " in the 
octave." In music, an octave is the eighth full tone above or 
below any given note. It is produced by double or half the 
number of vibrations corresponding to the given note. In the 
interval between a note and its octave is contained the full scale, 
the octave of a note forming the starting-point of another scale 
of similar intervals to the first. The interval between a note 
and its octave is also called an octave. The name is also applied 
to an open metal stop in an organ, and to a flute (more usually 
known as the piccolo) one octave higher in pitch than the 
regular flute. It is also a term for a " parade " in fencing. 
The "law of octaves" was a term applied in 1865 to a relation- 
ship among the chemical elements enunciated by J. A. R. 
Newlands. 

In literature an octave is a form of verse consisting of eight 
iambic lines, and complete in itself. From its use by the poets 
of Sicily, the recognized type of this form is usually called the 
Sicilian Octave. It is distinguished from a single stanza of 
ottava rima, in which the rhyme-arrangement is abababec, by 
having only two rhymes, arranged abababab. In German litera- 
ture the octave has been used not infrequently since 1820, when 
Ruckert published " Sicilianen," as they are called in German, 
I for the first time. The word octave is also often used to describe 
the eight opening lines of a sonnet, in which the rhyme-arrange- 
ment is abbaabba, or some modification of this, but properly 
always on two rhymes only. 


OCTA VIA, the name of two princesses of the Augustan house, 
(i) Octavia, daughter of Gaius Octavius and sister of the emperor 
Augustus, was the wife of Gaius Marcellus, one of the bitterest 
enemies of Julius Caesar. In 41 B.C. her husband died, and she 
was married to Marcus Antonius, with the idea of bringing about a 
reconciliation between him and her brother. Her efforts were 
at first successful, but in 36 Antony left for the Parthian War 
and renewed his intrigue with Cleopatra. Though Octavia 
took out troops and money to him (35), he refused to see her and 
formally divorced her in 32, but she always protected his children, 
even those by Fulvia and Cleopatra. Her beauty and virtues 
are praised by all ancient authorities. By her first husband she 
was the mother of Marcus Marcellus (q.v.), who died in 23 B.C. 
(2) Octavia, daughter of the emperor Claudius, was the wife of 
Nero, by whom she was put to death. A Latin tragedy on her 
fate is attributed, though wrongly, to Seneca. 


OCTAVO, a shortened form of Lat. in octavo, "in an eighth, 
i.e. of a sheet of paper, a term applied to a size of paper and to a 
size of a printed volume. Paper is in octavo when a whole single 
sheet is folded three times to form eight leaves; a book is techni- 
cally termed of " octavo " size when made up of sheets folded 
three times (see Bibliography and Paper). 


OCTOBER, the eighth month of the old Roman year, which 
began in March. In the Julian calendar, while retaining its 
old name, it became the tenth month, and had thirty-one days 
assigned to it. The meditrinalia, when a libation of new wine 
was made in honour of Meditrina, were celebrated on the nth, 
the faunalia on the 13th, and the equiria, when the equus October 
was sacrificed to Mars in the Campus Martius, on the 15th. 
Several attempts were made to rename the month in honour 
of the emperors. Thus it was in succession temporarily known 
as Germanicus, Antoninus, Tacitus and Herculeus, the latter 
a surname of Commodus. The senate's attempt to christen it 
Faustinus in honour of Faustina, wife of Antoninus, was equally 
unsuccessful. The principal ecclesiastical feasts in October are 
those of St Luke on the 18th and of St Simon and St Jude on 
the 28th. By the Slavs it is called " yellow month," from the 
fading of the leaf; to the Anglo-Saxons it was known as Winter- 
fylleth, because at this full moon (Jylleth) winter was supposed 
to begin. 


OCTODON, the generic name for a small South American 
rodent mammal (Octodon degus) locally known as the degu. 
It is the type of the family Octodontidae, the members of which 
— collectively termed octodonts — are exclusively Central and 
South American. Several of them, such as Echinomys and 
Lonckeres, are rat-like creatures with spiny or bristly fur (see 
Rodentia). 


OCTOPUS (Gr. 6wcb, eight and 7rous, foot), the name in 
scientific zoology belonging to a single genus of eight armed 
Cephalopoda (q.v.), one of whose distinguishing characters is that 
it has two rows of suckers on each arm. This true octopus occurs 
occasionally on the British coasts, at least the south coast, but 
is usually rare. It is more common on the southern coasts 
of Europe, including those of the Mediterranean. The usual 
species of Octopoda on the British south coast is Eledone cirrosa, 
which has only one row of suckers on each arm, and is a smaller 
animal. The celebrated account of the octopus given by Victor 
Hugo in his Travailleurs de la met is not so fictitious as some 
critics with a knowledge of natural history have maintained. 
It is true that the great French author has made the mistake 
of using the name Cephaloptcra, which belongs to a large tropical 
fish similar to a skate, instead of Cephalopoda, and that he applies 
the term devil-fish, which belongs to Cephaloptera, to the 
octopus. His description is exaggerated, imaginative and 
sensational; but it is correct in its most important particulars, 
and bears evidence that the author was to some extent personally 
acquainted with the animal and its habits, although he was not 
a scientific observer. The octopus feeds on crabs, and crabs feed 
on carrion, and, therefore, there is nothing impossible in Hugo's 
account of the skeleton of a drowned man surrounded by the 
shells of numbers of crabs which the octopus had devoured. 
Whether an octopus would attack and kill a man is another 
question, but it certainly might seize him with its arms and 
suckers while holding to the rocks by other arms, and a man 
seized in this way when in the water might be in danger of being 
drowned. 

The octopus and many of the Octopoda move about by means 
of their arms on the sea bottom, and are not free-swimming, 
though like other Cephalopods they can propel themselves 
on occasion backwards through the water by means of the funnel. 
Other Octopoda, however, are pelagic and free-swimming, and 
such habits are not confined to those forms which are provided 
with lateral fins. The Argonaut (see Nautilus) is one of the 
Octopoda. The separation of one of the arms of the male for 
purposes of reproduction is one of the most remarkable peculi- 
arities of the Octopoda. It does not occur, however, in octopus 
nor in many other members of the group. One arm is always 
considerably modified in structure and employed in copulation, 
but it is only in three genera, one of which is Argonauta, that the 
arm spontaneously separates. The detached arm is found still 
alive and moving in the mantle cavity of the female, and when 
first discovered in these circumstances was naturally regarded 
by the older naturalists as a parasite. Cuvier, on account of 
the numerous suckers of the detached arm, gave it the name 
Hectocotylus (hundred suckers). When the arm is not detached 
but only altered in structure it is said to be hectocotylized. 
In Octopus and Eledone it is the third right arm which is hecto- 
cotylized. The extremity of this arm is expanded and assumes 
the shape of a spoon. Whether detached or not the modified 
arm possesses a cavity into which the spermatophores are passed 
and the arm serves to convey them to the mantle cavity of the 
female. 

It has been mentioned above that the true octopus {Octopus 
vulgaris) is usually rare on the English coast. In 1899 and 1900, 
however, they became so abundant on the south coast as to 
attract general notice, and to constitute a veritable plague which 
threatened complete ruin to the shell-fish fisheries. This visita- 
tion and its effects were described by W. Garstang in the Journal 
of the Marine Biological Association. The abnormal abundance 
occurred all along the west coast of France, whence it extended 
to the Channel, and was probably due to a succession of unusually 
warm summers and mild winters, beginning with the warm 
spring and hot summer of 1893. The octopus in the years 
mentioned entered the lobster pots of the fishermen and devoured 
or killed the crabs and lobsters captured. The pots when hauled 
contained usually only living octopus and the mutilated remains 
of their victims. One fisherman took in a single week 64 specimens 
of octopus and only 15 living uninjured lobsters. The octopus 
also almost exterminated the swimming crabs (Portunus) in 
Plymouth Sound, and in the tanks of the Plymouth aquarium 
attacked and devoured all the specimens of its smaller relative 
Eledone cirrosa. 

With regard to the size which the octopus may attain, the 
dimensions of the body are not usually given in records, but it is 
stated that the arms in the largest specimens measured 3^ ft., 
and in numerous cases were 3 ft. in length. This would enable 
the eight arms to extend over a circle 6 ft. in diameter, but the 
globular body is not more than about a third of the length of an 
arm in diameter. When not in pursuit of prey the octopus 
hides itself in a hole between rocks and covers itself with stones 
and shells. Like its victims it seems to be active chiefly at night 
and to remain in its nest during the day.

OCTOROON, or Octaroon (from Lat. oclo f eight, formed on 
the example of quadroon), the offspring of a quadroon and a 
white; a person having one-eighth negro blood. In rare instances 
such persons are called tercerons, as being third in descent from 
a negro ancestor. Occasionally persons are called octoroons 
when tbe non-white element is not negro but some other coloured 
blood. 


OCTOSTYLE (Gr. 6kt6) eight, and gtv\os, a column), in archi- 
tecture, a portico of eight columns in front (see Temple). 


OCTROI (O. Fr. octroyer, to grant, authorize; Lat. auctor), 
a local tax collected on various articles brought into a district 
for consumption. Octroi taxes have a respectable antiquity, 
being known in Roman times as vectigalia. These vectigalia 
were either the portorium, a tax on the entry from or departure 
to the provinces (those cities which were allowed to levy the 
portorium shared the profits with the public treasury); the 
ansarium or for tear ium, a duty levied at the entrance to towns; 
or the edulia, sale imports levied in markets. Vectigalia were 
levied on wine and certain articles of food, but it was seldom 
that the cities were allowed to use the whole of the profits of the 
taxes. Vectigalia were introduced into Gaul by the Romans, 
and remained after the invasion by the Franks, under the name 
of tonlieux and couttimes. They were usually levied by the 
owners of seigniories. But during the 12th and 13th centuries, 
when the towns succeeded in asserting their independence, they 
at the same time obtained the recognition of their right to 
establish local taxation, and to have control of it. The royal 
power, however, gradually asserted itself, and it became the 
rule that permission to levy local taxes should be obtained from 
the king. From the 14th century onwards, we find numerous 
charters granting {octroyer) to French towns the right to tax 
themselves. The taxes did not remain strictly municipal, for 
an ordinance of Cardinal Mazarin (in 1647) ordered the proceeds 
of the octroi to be paid into the public treasury, and at other 
times the government claimed a certain percentage of the product, 
but this practice was finally abandoned in 1852. From an 
early time the octroi was farmed out to associations or private 
individuals, and so great were the abuses which arose from the 
system that the octroi was abolished during the Revolution. 
But such a drastic measure meant the stoppage of all municipal 
activities, and in 1798 Paris was allowed to re-establish its 
octroi. Other cities were allowed gradually to follow suit, 
and in 1809 a law was passed laying down the basis on which 
octrois might be established. Other laws have been passed 
from time to time in France dealing with the octroi, especially 
those of 1816, 1842, 1867, 1^71, 1884 and 1897. By the law 
of 1809 octroi duties were allowed on (1) beverages and li quids; 
(2) eatables; (3) fuel; (4) forage; (5) building materials. 
A scale of rates was fixed, graduated according to the population, 
and farming out was strictly regulated. A law of 1816 enacted 
that an octroi could only be established at the wish of a municipal 
council, and that only articles destined for local consumption 
could be taxed. The law of 1852 abolished the 10% of the 
gross receipts paid to the treasury. Certain indispensable 
commodities are allowed to enter free, such as grain, flour, fruit, 
vegetables and fish. 

French octroi duties are collected either by the (1) rigie simple, 
i.e. by special officers under the direction of the maire; (2) by 
the bail & ferine, i.e. farming, the contractor paying yearly a 
certain agreed upon sum calculated on the estimated amount; 

(3) the rSgie interesse, a variation of the preceding method, 
the contractor sharing the profits with the municipality when 
they reach a given sum; and (4) the abonnement avec la rtgie 
des contributions indirectes, under which a department of the 
treasury undertakes to collect tbe duties. More than half 
the octrois are collected under (1), and the numbers tend to 
increase; (2) is steadily decreasing, while (3) has been practically 
abandoned; (4) tends to increase. The gross receipts in 1901 
amounted to £11,132,870. A law of 1897 created new sources 
of taxation, giving communes the option of (1) new duties on 
alcohol; (2) a municipal licence duty on retailers of beverages; 
(3) a special tax on wine in bottle; (4) direct taxes on horses 
and carriages, clubs, billiard tables and dogs; (5) additional 
centimes to direct taxes. 

From time to time there has been agitation in France for 
the abolition of octroi duties, but it has never been pushed very 
earnestly. In 1869 a commission was appointed to consider 
the matter, and reported in favour of their retention. In Belgium, 
on the other hand, they were abolished in 1870, being replaced 
by an increase in customs and excise duties; and in 1903 
those in Egypt were also abolished. Octroi duties exist in Italy, 
Spain, Portugal and in some of the towns of Austria.

O'CURRY, EUGENE (1 796-1862), Irish scholar, was born at 
Dunaha, county Clare, in 1796, the son of a farmer who was a man 
of unusual intelligence. After being employed for some time in 
the topographical and historical section of the Irish ordnance 
survey, O'Curry earned his living by translating and copying Irish 
manuscripts. The catalogue of Irish manuscripts in the British 
Museum was compiled by him. On the founding of the Roman 
Catholic University of Ireland (1854) he was appointed professor 
of Irish history and archaeology. His lectures were published 
by the university in i860, and give a better knowledge of Irish 
medieval literature than can be obtained from any other one 
source. Three other volumes of lectures were published posthum- 
ously, under the title On the Manners and Customs of the Ancient 
Irish (1873). His voluminous transcripts, notably eight huge 
volumes of ancient Irish law, testify to his unremitting industry* 
The Celtic Society, of the council of which he was a member, 
published two of his translations of medieval tales. He died in 
Dublin in 1862. 


OCYDROME, a word formed from Ocydromus, meaning 
" swift-runner," and suggested by J. Wagler in 1830 as a generic 
term for the New Zealand bird called in the then unpublished 
manuscripts of J. R. Forster Rallus troglodytes, and so designated 
in 1788 by S. G. Gmelin, who knew of it through J. Latham's 
English description. Wagler's suggestion has since been generally 
adopted, and the genus Ocydromus is accepted by most ornith- 
ologists as a valid group of Rallidae; but the number of species 
it contains is admittedly doubtful, owing to the variability in 
size and plumage which they exhibit, and their correct nomencla- 
ture must for the present be considered uncertain. Sir W. 
Buller in his Birds of New Zealand identifies the " Wood-hen," 
observed in great abundance on the shores of Dusky Bay in 
1 7 73 by Cook and his companions on his second voyage, with the ' 
Gallirallus fuscus described and figured by Du Bus in 1847, 
and accordingly calls it 0. fuscus ; but it cannot be questioned 
that the species from this locality — which appears to have 
a somewhat limited range in the Middle Island, 1 and never to be 
met with far from the sea-coast, where it lives wholly on crus- 
taceans and other marine animals — is identical with that of the 
older authors just mentioned. In 1786 Sparrman, who had 
also been of Cook's company, figured and described as Rallus 
australis a bird which, though said by him to be that of tbe 
southern coast of New Zealand, differs so much from the R. 
troglodytes as to compel a belief in its specific distinctness; and 
indeed his species has generally been identified with the common 
" Weka " of the Maories of the .Middle Island, which can scarcely 
be tbe case if his statement is absolutely true, since the latter 
does not appear to reach so far to the southward, or to affect 
the seashore. It may therefore be fairly inferred that his subject 
was obtained from some other locality. The North Island of 
New Zealand has what is allowed to be a third species, to which 
the name of Ocydromus earli is attached, and this was formerly 
very plentiful; but its numbers have rapidly decreased, and 
there is every chance of its soon being as extinct as is the species 
which tenanted Norfolk Island on its discovery by Cook in 1774, 
and which was doubtless distinct from all the rest, though no 
specimen of it is known to exist in any museum. 1 Another 
species, 0. sylvestris, smaller and lighter in colour than any of 
the rest, was found in 1869 to linger yet in Lord Howe's Island 
(Proc. Zool. Society, 1869, p. 473, pi. xxxv.). Somewhat differing 
from Ocydromus, but apparently very nearly allied to it, is a 
little bird peculiar, it is believed, to the Chatham Islands (Ibis, 
1872, p. 247), and regarded by Captain Hutton as the type of 
a genus Cabalus under the name of C. modesties, while other 
naturalists consider it to be the young of the rare RaUus dieffen* 
bachi. So far the distribution of the Ocydromine form is wholly 
in accordance with that of most others characteristic of the New 
Zealand sub-region; but a curious exception is asserted to have 
been found in the Gallirallus lafresnayanus of New Caledonia, 
which, though presenting some structural differences, has been 
referred to the genus Ocydromus. 

The chief interest attaching to the Ocy dromes is their inability 
to use in flight the wings with which they are furnished, and 
hence an extreme probability of the form becoming wholly 
extinct in a short time. Of this inability there are other instances 
among the Rallidae (see Moor-hen); but here we have coupled 
with it the curious fact that in the skeleton the angle which the 
scapula makes with the coracoid is greater than a right angle, 
a peculiarity shared only, so far as is known, among the Carinatae 
by the dodo. The Ocydromes are birds of dull plumage, and 
mostly of retiring habits, though the common species is said to 
show great boldness towards man, and, from the accounts of 
Cook and the younger Forster, the birds seen by them displayed 
little fear. They are extremely destructive to eggs and to any 
other birds they can master. (A. N.) 

[1] It also occurs in Stewart Island, and singularly enough on the 
more distant group known as the Snares. The Gallirallus brachy- 
pterus of Lafresnaye, of which the typical (and unique?) specimen 
from an unknown locality is in the Caen Museum, has also been 
referred to this species, but the propriety of the act may be doubted. 


ODAENATHUS, or Odenatus (Gr. 'OdalvaOos, Palm, nr™ = 
" little ear "), the Latinized form of Odainath, the name of a 
famous prince of Palmyra, in the second half of the 3rd century 
a.d., who succeeded in recovering the Roman East from the 
Persians and restoring it to the Empire. He belonged to the 
leading family of Palmyra, which bore, in token of Roman 
citizenship, the gentilicium of Septimius; hence his full name 
was Septimius Odainath (Vogue, Syrie centrale, Nos. 23, 28 = 
Cooke, North-Semitic Inscrr. Nos. 126, 130). It is practically 
certain that he was the son of Septimius IJairan the " senator 
and chief of Tadmor," the son of Septimius Odainath " the 
senator " (N.S.I, p. 285). The year when he became chief of 
Palmyra is not known, but already in an inscription dated a.d. 
258 he is styled " the illustrious consul our lord " (N.S.I. No. 
126). He possessed the characteristic vigour and astuteness of 
the old Arab stock from which he sprang; and la his wife, the 
renowned Zenobia (q.v .), he found an able supporter of his policy. 
The defeat and captivity of the emperor Valerian (a.d. 260) 
left the eastern provinces largely at the mercy of the Persians; 
the prospect of Persian supremacy was not one which Palmyra 
or its prince had any reason to desire. At first, it seems, Odainath 
attempted to propitiate the Parthian monarch Shapur (Sapor) 
I.; but when his gifts were contemptuously rejected (Petr. 
Patricius, § 10) he decided to throw in his lot with the cause of 
Rome. The neutrality which had made Palmyra's fortune was 
abandoned for an active military policy which, while it added 
to Odainath's fame, in a short time brought his native city to 
its ruin. He fell upon the victorious Persians returning home 
after the sack of Antioch, and before they could cross the 
Euphrates inflicted upon them a considerable defeat. Then, 
when two usurping emperors were proclaimed in the East 
(a.d. 261), Odainath took the side of Gallienus the son and 
successor of Valerian, attacked and put to death the usurper 
Quietus at Emesa (IJflms), and was rewarded for his loyalty 
by "the grant of an exceptional position (a.d. 262). He may have 
assumed the title of king before; but he now became " totius 
Orientis imperator," not indeed joint-ruler, nor Augustus, 
but " independent lieutenant of the emperor for the East" 
(Mommsen, Provinces, ii. p. 103).* In a series of rapid and 
successful campaigns, during which he left Palmyra under the 
charge of Septimius Worod his deputy (N.S.I. Nos. 127-129), 
he crossed the Euphrates and relieved Edessa, recovered Nislbis 
and Carrhae, and even took the offensive against the power of 
Persia, and twice invested Ctesiphon itself, the capital; probably 
also he brought back Armenia into the Empire. These brilliant 
successes restored the Roman rule in the East; and Gallienus 
did not disdain to hold a triumph with the captives and trophies 
which Odainath had won (a.d. 264). While observing all due 
formalities towards his overlord, there can be little doubt that 
Odainath aimed at independent empire; but during his life- 
time no breach with Rome occurred. He was about to start for 
Cappadocia against the Goths when he was assassinated, together 
with Herodes his eldest son, by his nephew Maconius; there 
is no reason to suppose that this deed of violence was in- 
stigated from Rome. After his death (a.d. 266-267) Zenobia 
succeeded to his position, and practically governed Palmyra on 
behalf of her young son Wahab-allath or Athenodorus (see 
Palmyra). (G. A. C.*) 

[1] The younger Forster remarked that the birds of Norfolk Island, 
though believed by the other naturalists of Cook's ship to be generally 
the same as those of New Zealand, were distinguished dv their 
brighter colouring (see also Nestor). There can be no doubt that 
all the land-birds were specifically distinct. It is possible that 
Sparrman's R. australis, which cannot very confidently be referred 
to any known species of Ocydromus, may have been from Norfolk 
Island. 


ODALISQUE, a slave-woman who is a member of an oriental 
harem, especially one in the harem or seraglio of the sultan of 
Turkey. The word is the French adaptation of the Turkish 
odaliq, formed from odah, chamber or room in a harem. 


ODD (in middle English odde, from old Norwegian oddi, an 
angle of a triangle; the old Norwegian oddamann is used of the 
third man who gives a casting vote in a dispute), that which 
remains over after an equal division, the unit in excess of an even 
number; thus in numeration the word is used of a number 
either above or below a round number, an indefinite cardinal 
number, as " eighty and odd," or " eighty odd." As applied 
to individuals, the sense of " one left after a division " leads to 
that of " solitary," and thus of " uncommon " or " strange." 
In the plural, " odds " was originally used to denote inequalities 
especially in the phrase " to make odds even." The sense of a 
difference in benefit leads to such colloquialisms as " makes 
no odds," while that of variance appears in the expression 
" to be at odds." In betting " the odds " is the advantage given 
by one person to another in proportion to the supposed chances 
of success. 

ODDE, or Odda, a village of Norway, in South Bergenhus 
amt (county), on the Sor Fjord, a head-branch of the great 
Hardanger Fjord. It is 48 m. directly S.E. of Bergen, but 123 
by water (to Eide),road (to Vossevangen), and rail thenceforward, 
or about the same distance by water alone. It is one of the 
principal tourist-centres in southern Norway, being at the end 
of the road from Breifond (27 m.) near which the routes join from 
Stavanger by Sand, Lake Suldal, and the Bratlandsdal, and 
from the south-eastern coast towns by the Telemark. This road, 
descending from the Horrebraekke, passes through the gorge 
of Seljestadjuvet, passes the Espelandsfos and Lotefos falls, 
and skirts the Sandven lake. Odde is also a centre for several 
favourite excursions, as to the Buarbrae, one of the glaciers 
descending from the great Folgefond snowfield, situated in a 
precipitous valley (JordaV) to the west of Sandven lake; to the 
Skjaeggedalsfos, a magnificent fall (525 ft.); or across the 
Folgefond to Suldal, a station on the Mauranger branch of the 
Hardanger fjord. Touring steamers and frequent local 
steamers from Bergen call at Odde, and there are several large 
hotels. 

[1] The late Roman chronicler Trebellius Pollio goes further and 
asserts " Odenatus rex Palmyrenorum optinuit totius Orientis 
imperium. . . . Gallienus Odenatum participato imperio Augustum 
vocavit," Hist. Aug. xxiii. 10 and 12. This is not borne out by the 
evidence. The highest rank claimed for him by his own people 
is recorded in an inscription dated 271 (N.S.I. No. 130) set up by 
the two generals of the Palmyrene army; Odainath is styled* 1 king 
of kings and restorer of the whole city " ; but this does not mean that 
he ever held the title of Augustus, and the inscription was set up 
after his death and during the revolt of Palmyra*. 


ODDFELLOWS, ORDER OF, a secret benevolent and social 
society, having mystic signs of recognition, initiatory rites and 
ceremonies, and various grades of dignity and honour. Great 
antiquity has been claimed for the order of Oddfellows — the 
most popular tradition ascribing it to the Jewish legion under 
Titus, who, it is asserted, received from the emperor its first 
charter written on a golden tablet. Oddfellows themselves, 
however, now generally admit that the institution cannot be 
traced back beyond the first half of the 18th century, and explain 
the name as adopted at a time when the severance into sects 
and classes was so wide that persons aiming at social union and 
mutual help were a marked exception to the general rule. 
Mention is made by Defoe of the society of Oddfellows, but the 
oldest lodge of which the name has been handed down is the 
Loyal Aristarcus, No. 9, which met in 1745 "at the Oakley 
Arms, Borough of Southwark; Globe Tavern, Hatton Garden; 
or the Boar's Head in Smithfield, as the noble master may direct." 
The earliest lodges were supported by each member and visitor 
paying a penny to the secretary on entering the lodge, and special 
sums were voted to any brother in need. If out of work he was 
supplied with a card and funds to reach the next lodge, and he 
went from lodge to lodge until he found employment. The lodges 
gradually adopted a definite common ritual and became confeder- 
ated under the name of the Patriotic Order. Towards the end of 
the century many of the lodges were broken up by State prosecu- 
tions on the suspicion that their purposes were " seditious," but 
the society continued to exist as the Union Order of Oddfellows 
until 1809. In 1813, at a convention in Manchester, was formed 
the Independent Order of Oddfellows, Manchester Unity, which 
now overshadows all tbe minor societies in England. Oddfellow- 
ship was introduced into the United States from the Manchester 
Unity in 1819, and the grand lodge of Maryland and the United 
States was constituted on the 22nd of February 1821. It now 
rivals in membership and influence the Manchester Unity, from 
which it severed its connexion in 1842. In 1843 it issued a dis- 
pensation for opening the Prince of Wales Lodge No. 1 at Montreal, 
Canada. The American society, including Canada and the United 
States, has its headquarters at Baltimore. Organizations, 
connected either with the United States or England, have been 
founded in France, Germany, Switzerland, Gibraltar and Malta, 
Australia, New Zealand, the Fiji Islands, the Hawaiian Islands, 
South Africa, South America, the West Indies and Barbados, 
and elsewhere. 

The rules of the different societies, various song-books, and a 
number of minor books on Oddfellowship have been published, but 
the most complete and trustworthy account of the institution is 
that in The Complete Manual of Oddfellowship, its History, Principles, 
Ceremonies and Symbolism, privately printed (1879). See also 
Friendly Societies.
